I'll analyze the question and rubric against the calibration anchors, focusing on the students' limited English proficiency and common pitfalls.

The question "Define fable" requires a specific definition. The rubric specifies "a short story that typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson."

Let's consider the cognitive load and language demands:

1.  **Vocabulary:** "Define" is a common instruction, but "fable" itself might be known primarily through examples rather than a formal definition for many students.
2.  **Conceptual Understanding:** Do students understand the *components* of a fable (short story, animals, moral lesson) well enough to articulate them in a definition? They might recognize a fable when they read one, but defining it is a higher-order task.
3.  **English Expression:** Even if they understand the concept, articulating it concisely and accurately in English, especially including all three key elements (short story, animals, moral), will be challenging for students with limited English.
4.  **Recall vs. Recognition:** This is a recall question, requiring active retrieval and formulation, not just recognition from options.

Let's look at the anchors:

*   **5% Pass Rate (Theme/Central Idea):** This is very abstract and requires strong inferential skills and English to articulate a complex idea from a poem. Defining a term is less abstract, but still requires precision.
*   **15% Pass Rate (Differentiate Archaeological/Literary Sources):** This requires comparing two concepts and providing examples. It's more complex than defining one term, but also allows for partial credit (like defining one and not the other). The current question is all-or-nothing for the definition.
*   **30% Pass Rate (My Favorite Season - paragraph):** This is creative writing on a common topic, allowing for simpler language and less strict adherence to complex definitions. The rubric allows a lot of flexibility for "3 marks."
*   **50% Pass Rate (Three Questions the King Wanted to Answer):** This is direct recall of specific plot points from a story they likely read. If they remember the story, they can often list these. It's direct information retrieval.
*   **66% Pass Rate (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is also direct recall of specific facts, which can be done by listing two relatively short phrases. The language barrier is lower for factual recall in short phrases.

**Challenging Assumptions for "Define Fable":**

*   **"Most students could do this":** My initial instinct might be that "fable" is a common literary term. However, for these students, "common" is relative. They might have read fables, but explicitly defining it with all elements (short story, animals, moral) is a different cognitive load.
*   **Limited English:** Articulating "a short story that typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson" is quite a mouthful for limited English speakers. They might get "animals" and "moral" but miss "short story" or struggle to link them grammatically.
*   **"Basic" Concepts:** While basic in a literary sense, defining it precisely is not trivial for struggling learners.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** This is a significant factor. If they don't *exactly* know the definition or struggle with the English, they might leave it blank, as seen in the 15% and 50% anchors.
*   **Exact Question Type:** They might not have practiced formal definitions in this way.

**Comparison:**

*   It's harder than the 50% item (direct recall of specific, easy-to-list points). The fable definition requires synthesis and precise language.
*   It's potentially harder than the 30% item (paragraph writing allows more freedom).
*   It's likely *easier* than the 15% item (differentiating two concepts) because it's only one concept.
*   It's definitely easier than the 5% item (abstract theme).

The key is the precision required by the rubric for a single mark and the students' English proficiency. They might get one or two parts right but fail to include all three. For example, "It's a story with animals and a lesson" might miss "short" and potentially the structure, leading to a 0 if the rubric is strict for a 1-mark question.

Considering the high blank response rates for harder questions and the linguistic demands, I think it will be below the 30% mark but above the 15% mark. It's not as complex as differentiating, but the definition must be very close to the rubric for a 1.

Let's consider scenarios:
*   Many will know "animals" and "moral."
*   Fewer will articulate
