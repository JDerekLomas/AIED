I will analyze the question, the student demographic, and compare it to the provided calibration anchors to make a calibrated estimate.

**Question Analysis:**
The question asks for *one key feature* of Harappan Civilization's urban planning. This requires knowledge of a specific historical topic taught in Indian schools, likely from a social science or history textbook. Students need to recall this information and articulate it in English.

**Student Demographic Analysis:**
*   **Class 8 students:** They would have been exposed to this topic in their curriculum.
*   **Indian government schools:** These often have limited resources.
*   **Mostly from economically weaker sections:** This correlates with limited access to supplementary learning materials, private tutoring, and often, less exposure to English outside of school.
*   **Limited English:** This is a critical factor. Even if they know the answer in their native language, translating it into comprehensible English can be a significant hurdle. Spelling and grammar will likely be poor.
*   **Average pass rate 29%:** This is a very low average, indicating significant struggles across the board.
*   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** As noted in the instructions, this reduces scores.
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic for struggling learners:** Harappan Civilization's urban planning, while a standard topic, might not be deeply understood or retained by a large portion of students.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."** This requires comprehension of a poem and abstract thinking to identify a theme. The English required is moderate.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each.** This requires understanding two abstract historical concepts and providing examples. The English required is moderate. Students who get it right demonstrate some conceptual understanding and ability to articulate it.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."** This is a personal, descriptive task, often practiced. It allows for simpler English and focuses on personal experience, making it relatively easier to produce *some* coherent text, even if short.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is a recall question from a specific story, requiring direct memorization. The English required is minimal (listing three short phrases). This suggests that direct recall questions from taught stories, with minimal language complexity, can have a moderate pass rate.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.** This is a direct recall question of specific, often-repeated, and politically significant concepts. It requires minimal English (listing two phrases). The high pass rate indicates that direct recall of well-drilled, factual information with low language demand is the easiest category.

**Applying to the Target Question:**
"Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

*   **Knowledge required:** This is a factual recall question, similar to the "Fundamental Rights" or "King's questions" in type. Students would have studied this in history.
*   **Language required:** "Describe one key feature" is more demanding than "Name any two" or "What were the three questions." While not a full paragraph, it requires constructing a simple sentence or phrase that accurately conveys the feature (e.g., "They had a good drainage system," or "Their cities were divided into two parts"). This is slightly more complex than just listing.
*   **Specificity of answer:** Options like "grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," or "citadel/lower town" are specific terms. Even if students remember "good planning," they need to articulate *what kind* of planning.

**Challenging Initial Instincts:**
My first instinct might be "this is a basic history fact, many students should know it." However, I must consider:
1.  **Limited English:** Can they articulate "well-planned grid layout" or "advanced drainage system" even if they recall the concept? Many might only manage fragmented words.
2.  **Recall over time:** While taught, how well is it retained months or years later, especially for struggling students?
3.  **Specific terminology:** Do they remember the specific *feature* or just a vague sense of "they had good cities"? The rubric demands a *key feature*.

Comparing it to the anchors:
*   It's more demanding than naming fundamental rights (66%) because it requires a descriptive phrase, not just a list.
*   It's similar to the king's questions (50%) in that it's factual recall, but the phrasing for the Har
