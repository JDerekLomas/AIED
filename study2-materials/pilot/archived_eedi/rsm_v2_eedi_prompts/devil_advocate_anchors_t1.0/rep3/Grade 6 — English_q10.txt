I'll analyze the question and compare it to the calibration anchors, keeping in mind the students' context.

**Question Analysis:**
*   **Concept:** This question tests the usage of "some" vs. "any" in affirmative sentences. This is a fundamental grammar concept in English.
*   **Complexity:** It's a multiple-choice-like question (choosing between two options), which is generally easier than open-ended questions.
*   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary ("apples," "basket") is extremely basic.
*   **Sentence Structure:** Simple, declarative sentence.

**Considering the Student Context (Class 6, Indian government schools, economically weaker, limited English, average pass rate 29%):**

*   **Limited English:** While "some/any" is basic, students with very limited English might struggle if they haven't explicitly covered this rule or if their exposure to natural English sentences is low. They might guess.
*   **"Basic" isn't basic:** For struggling learners, even this can be a hurdle. They might overthink it or apply a rule incorrectly.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** Some might leave it blank, but since it's a simple choice, a guess is more likely than a blank.
*   **Prior Practice:** This specific type of fill-in-the-blank grammar question is common in English language teaching, so they likely would have encountered it.

**Comparing to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** This requires abstract thinking, understanding metaphors, and expressing complex ideas in English. Much harder.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires understanding two distinct concepts, recalling definitions, and providing examples, all in coherent English. Significantly harder.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires sustained writing, organizing thoughts, and specific details, even with prompts. Harder than a single word choice.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is recall from a specific story. If they knew the story, it's straightforward recall. This is closer in difficulty *if* they know the specific grammar rule. It's a memory test.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** This is direct recall of specific facts. If they know the facts, it's easy. It's also a memory test.

**My Analysis for "some/any":**

The "some/any" rule for affirmative sentences is usually taught quite early in English grammar. While students have limited English, this specific grammatical point is foundational and frequently drilled. It's a *recognition* task rather than a *production* task (like writing a paragraph or explaining a concept).

Compared to the 50% anchor (recalling specific questions from a story), this is similar in that it relies on recalling a specific piece of knowledge (a grammar rule). However, grammar rules are often drilled more frequently than specific story details. Compared to the 66% anchor (recalling Fundamental Rights), it's also a direct recall of a rule/fact.

The main challenge for the lower-performing students will be the recall of this specific grammar rule. Those who haven't grasped it will likely guess or make a mistake. However, given its foundational nature, a significant portion of students, even those struggling, would have had some exposure and practice with this. It's a discrete skill, not requiring complex synthesis or extended writing.

I initially thought it might be very high, like 70-80%, but remembering the "limited English" and "basic isn't basic" warnings, I need to temper that. Many might confuse "some" with "any" if they only remember "any" for questions or negatives, but don't firmly grasp "some" for positives.

The fact that "some" is the correct choice in a positive sentence is very standard. It's arguably *more* basic than recalling specific historical sources or even specific fundamental rights, which might require more formal learning.

Let's reconsider the 50% and 66% anchors. They both require recall of specific taught information. The grammar rule for "some/any" is also specific taught information, but it's *more frequently used and practiced* in general English learning than specific historical facts or legal rights.

Therefore, while not 100%, a substantial majority should get this right if they have even a rudimentary grasp of basic English sentence structure. The simplicity of the vocabulary and sentence structure also helps.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for the entire exam, this question is definitely on the easier side. It doesn't require complex thinking, only the application of a basic rule.
