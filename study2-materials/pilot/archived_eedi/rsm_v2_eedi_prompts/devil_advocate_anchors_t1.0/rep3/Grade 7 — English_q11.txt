The question asks students to identify an "adjective phrase," but the rubric states that simply identifying "tiny" as an adjective is sufficient for a score of 1. This is a significant discrepancy. If the rubric is strictly followed, the question is much easier than if students were expected to identify a *phrase*.

Let's assume the rubric is what dictates scoring, meaning students just need to identify "tiny."

Factors to consider:
1.  **English Proficiency:** The students have limited English. "Adjective" is a grammatical term that many might not be familiar with, even if they can use adjectives correctly in their own speech.
2.  **Grammar Knowledge:** Grammar can be a weak point for many students, especially those struggling academically. Identifying parts of speech explicitly requires formal grammatical instruction.
3.  **Ambiguity in Question/Rubric:** The question asks for an "adjective *phrase*," but "tiny" is an adjective, not a phrase. This could confuse students who *do* understand grammar. If they look for a phrase and only see a single word that's an adjective, they might either leave it blank or struggle to decide what to put. However, if they just vaguely understand "adjective" and pick out a descriptive word, "tiny" is the most obvious choice.
4.  **Difficulty of "Tiny":** "Tiny" is a simple, common adjective. It's not a complex or obscure word.
5.  **Pass Rate for Similar Items:**
    *   "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%): Requires recall of specific facts, but the question is straightforward.
    *   "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%): Requires recall of specific plot points from a story.
    *   "Write a short paragraph... My favorite season" (30%): Requires sentence construction and ideas, open-ended.
    *   "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" (15%): Requires understanding of abstract concepts and comparison.
    *   "Write a theme or central idea of the poem" (5%): Requires high-level comprehension and abstraction.

Comparing to the anchors:
*   The "Fundamental Rights" question (66%) is about recalling specific facts. This question is about identifying a grammatical term.
*   The "King's questions" (50%) is also about recalling facts.
*   Identifying a part of speech like an adjective, while basic, requires formal grammar knowledge. Many students might use adjectives without knowing the term.

If the question truly meant "adjective phrase," it would be much harder, probably in the 15-30% range because identifying a phrase requires more nuanced understanding than a single word. However, given the rubric's simplification to just "tiny," it becomes a test of identifying *a descriptive word* and associating it with the (potentially unfamiliar) term "adjective."

Students are from economically weaker sections with limited English. They might know what "tiny" means and even understand it describes the bird, but connecting it to the formal grammatical term "adjective" is the hurdle.

Let's consider two scenarios given the discrepancy:
*   **Scenario A: Teachers mark based on "adjective phrase" understanding.** This would mean "tiny" alone is not enough, and students would need to either incorrectly identify "a tiny" or "tiny bird" as a phrase, or fail to identify anything. This would push the pass rate much lower, perhaps 15-20%.
*   **Scenario B: Teachers mark based on the rubric ("tiny" as an adjective).** This means simply pointing to "tiny" is enough. The question then becomes: how many students can identify "tiny" as an adjective? Many might struggle with the term "adjective" itself. However, it is the most prominent descriptive word.

The prompt states: "The student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." This strongly points to Scenario B.

Even with Scenario B, the word "adjective" is a technical term. Many students, especially those with limited English and from weaker academic backgrounds, might not know this term, even if they understand the concept of a descriptive word. They might point to "bird," "nest," "balcony," or even leave it blank because they don't recognize "adjective."

It's simpler than the 30% paragraph writing, which requires coherent thought and sentence structure. It's likely harder than the 50% "King's questions" which is pure recall from a story they presumably studied. It's definitely harder than the 66% "Fundamental Rights" which is also pure recall.

Given the linguistic and academic challenges, associating a simple descriptive word with its formal grammatical term (adjective) is still a significant hurdle. Many might pick "bird" thinking it
