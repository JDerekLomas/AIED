I will use the provided calibration anchors and the problem description to estimate the pass rate.

1.  **Analyze the question:**
    *   It's a word problem involving time and temperature increase.
    *   Requires calculating the time difference (10 am to 4 pm).
    *   Requires multiplication (hours * temperature increase per hour).
    *   Requires addition (initial temperature + total increase).
    *   The numbers are relatively simple (30, 2, 6).
    *   The language is straightforward, but "at 4:00 in the evening" might be a slight cognitive load for some, but generally understandable.

2.  **Break down the steps required for a correct answer (as per rubric):**
    *   **Step 1:** Calculate the time elapsed from 10 am to 4 pm. This is 6 hours. This is the explicit rubric requirement.
    *   **Step 2:** Calculate the total temperature increase: 6 hours * 2°C/hour = 12°C.
    *   **Step 3:** Calculate the final temperature: 30°C + 12°C = 42°C.

3.  **Consider the student population:**
    *   Class 6 students in Indian government schools.
    *   Mostly economically weaker sections.
    *   Limited English.
    *   Average pass rate for the exam is 29%.
    *   Exam anxiety, absent students, lack of practice for exact question types are significant factors.

4.  **Compare to calibration anchors:**

    *   **Pass rate 5%:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" This requires abstract thinking, understanding poetry, and expressing a theme in English. Very difficult.
    *   **Pass rate 15%:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each." This requires conceptual understanding, comparative analysis, and factual recall, all expressed in English. Quite difficult.
    *   **Pass rate 30%:** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'" This is a creative writing task based on personal experience, but requires forming coherent sentences and paragraphs in English. Many students struggle with the length and structure.
    *   **Pass rate 50%:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" This is a direct recall question from a story, likely involving simple memorization and copying/recalling key phrases. If they read the story and remembered, it's relatively easy.
    *   **Pass rate 66%:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." This is also a direct recall question of two specific terms. If they studied these terms, it's straightforward. Many students managed to name at least one correctly.

5.  **Evaluate the current question's difficulty:**

    *   **Math concepts:** Addition, multiplication, time calculation. These are fundamental Class 6 math skills. The numbers are simple.
    *   **English comprehension:** "At 10 am in the morning," "temperature increases by 2°C per hour," "at 4:00 in the evening." The language is very direct and uses common vocabulary related to time and temperature. It's less abstract than finding a theme or differentiating concepts.
    *   **Problem-solving:** It's a multi-step problem, which can be challenging for students who struggle with breaking down problems. The time calculation (10 am to 4 pm) might trip some students who struggle with analog clock time or counting hours across noon.
    *   **Common pitfalls:**
        *   Miscalculating time (e.g., 4 hours, 5 hours).
        *   Forgetting to add the initial temperature.
        *   Making a calculation error.
        *   Struggling with the word problem format, even if they know the math.
        *   Blank response due to anxiety or not understanding the initial setup.

6.  **Calibrate the estimate:**

    *   It's harder than simply recalling two facts (66%).
    *   It's likely harder than recalling three specific phrases from a story (50%), because it requires application, not just recall.
    *   It's significantly easier than writing a short paragraph (30%) in terms of English production and creative thought. Students don't need to generate sentences, just perform calculations and write a number.
    *   It's much easier than differentiating concepts or finding a poem's theme (15%, 5%).

    The core difficulty lies in correctly calculating the time elapsed and then applying the rate. Many students will likely get the
