I'll analyze the question and compare it to the calibration anchors.

**Question Analysis:**
*   **Skill:** Arranging numbers in ascending order. This is a fundamental math skill usually taught early.
*   **Complexity:** Four 3-digit and 4-digit numbers. The smallest is a 3-digit number, which might make it slightly easier to identify as the smallest compared to if all were 4-digit numbers.
*   **Language:** Very minimal English required. "Arrange in ascending order" is the key phrase. If students understand "ascending order" (smallest to largest), the rest is numerical.
*   **Rubric:** Only requires identifying the smallest number (736) and placing it first for 0.5 marks. This is a very lenient rubric. A student doesn't even need to correctly order all of them, just the first one.

**Comparison to Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 66% anchor ("Name any two Fundamental Rights...")**: This requires recall of specific facts, but the language is straightforward. Many students could likely recall at least two. The rubric for my target question is *more lenient* than this, only requiring the first step of ordering.

*   **Pass rate 50% anchor ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?")**: This requires recalling specific details from a story. Again, straightforward language. The rubric for the target question is more forgiving.

*   **Pass rate 30% anchor ("Write a short paragraph... My favorite season")**: This requires creative writing, sentence construction, and specific detail recall (what they eat/wear/do). The examples show very fragmented English. My target question requires almost no English and no creative writing, just a basic mathematical operation. The rubric is much simpler.

*   **Pass rate 15% anchor ("Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources...")**: This requires understanding definitions, differentiation, and providing examples. Much higher cognitive load and language requirement than my target question.

*   **Pass rate 5% anchor ("Write a theme or central idea of the poem...")**: This is abstract thinking, literary analysis, and expressing a complex idea in English. Far, far more difficult than my target question.

**Challenging Assumptions:**

*   **"Could a student who barely reads English?"**: Yes. The English phrase "Arrange in ascending order" is very common in math. If they've seen it even once or twice in a math context, they likely understand it. The numbers themselves require no English reading.
*   **"Could a student who was absent for this topic?"**: Ordering numbers is a very foundational skill, likely introduced long before Class 6 and reinforced repeatedly. Even if they missed one lesson, the concept should be ingrained.
*   **"Exam anxiety causing blank responses?"**: While possible, the sheer simplicity of identifying the smallest number among four (especially with one being a 3-digit number) makes it very accessible. It's a quick mental check.

The key here is the *very lenient rubric* (only needing the first number correct) and the *minimal English requirement* for a foundational math skill. The difficulty is primarily in understanding "ascending order." Given that this is a common math term, and the numbers are simple, I expect a high proportion to get at least the first number correct.

I initially thought 70-80%, but considering the strictness of the rubric for other questions and the general low pass rates, I will adjust slightly. However, identifying the smallest number among these four is almost trivial, especially with a 3-digit number standing out. Even if a student gets the entire order wrong, but *happens* to put the smallest number first, they still score.

Given the 66% anchor required factual recall of two fundamental rights, and this question requires a very basic math skill with a super lenient rubric, it should be significantly higher than 50%. The difficulty of understanding "ascending order" is the only potential stumbling block, but it's a fundamental math term.

My estimate leans closer to the 66% anchor because the task is objectively very simple for the score awarded.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 72%
