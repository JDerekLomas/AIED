I'll analyze the question and compare it to the calibration anchors.

**Question:** Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence:\nbook/reading/a/is/he
**Rubric:** Arranges words into 'He is reading a book.' (subject-verb-object format)
**Max score:** 1

**Analysis:**

*   **Grammar:** This question tests basic English sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object).
*   **Vocabulary:** All words are extremely common and should be known even by students with limited English.
*   **Cognitive Load:** The task is simple rearrangement of a short, common sentence. There are no complex ideas or multiple steps.
*   **English Proficiency:** While students have limited English, forming simple sentences is often one of the first things they learn. The words are provided, so no recall of vocabulary is needed. The main challenge is understanding the typical SVO order.

**Comparing to Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** This requires abstract thinking, understanding metaphors, and expressing complex ideas in English. Much harder.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** This requires understanding historical concepts, recalling definitions, and providing examples, all in English. Significantly harder.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This requires generating multiple sentences, recalling vocabulary, organizing thoughts, and meeting length requirements. Harder.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This requires recalling specific details from a story. If they remember the story, the answer is direct. This is closer in directness but involves memory recall of a specific text.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** This requires recalling specific factual information (names of rights). If they know them, it's straightforward. This is probably the closest in difficulty level in terms of being a direct, non-abstract task.

**Factors to consider for *this* question:**

*   **No new vocabulary:** All words are given.
*   **No complex concepts:** Just sentence structure.
*   **Common sentence structure:** "He is reading a book" is a very basic, frequently encountered present continuous sentence.
*   **Limited English students:** While their productive English is weak, they often have some receptive understanding and familiarity with basic sentence patterns. They might have practiced similar rearrangement exercises.
*   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** Some students will still leave it blank, but the simplicity reduces the mental block compared to open-ended or complex questions.
*   **"Barely reads English":** Even students who struggle with reading comprehension might recognize these words and be able to put them in the common order.

My initial instinct would be higher, perhaps 75-80%, but applying the "challenge your first instinct" rule:

*   Could a student who barely reads English do it? Yes, they might recognize the sequence of these specific words if they've encountered it or similar simple sentences often.
*   Could a student who was absent for this topic? Possibly, if their general exposure to English has been sufficient to absorb basic SVO.
*   The gap between 50% and 66% involves recalling specific facts. This question involves applying a common grammatical rule to provided words.

This type of question is fundamental to early English learning. Many students, despite their overall low proficiency, would have drilled these kinds of exercises. The words are simple and directly related to a common activity.

Given the 66% anchor (recalling two fundamental rights, which requires specific memorization), this question seems slightly *easier* because it involves applying a very common pattern with provided words, rather than recalling specific names/facts. However, the "average pass rate is 29%" reminds me that even simple tasks can be difficult.

A student who scores 0 on "My favorite season" (30% pass rate) might still get this right, as it doesn't require original thought or vocabulary generation.

Considering the extreme simplicity of the words and the basic nature of the SVO structure, I think it will be on the higher end, but not exceedingly so, due to the overall low proficiency and potential for blanks. I'll place it slightly above the Fundamental Rights question, as the components are all given and it's a very common grammatical pattern.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 70%
