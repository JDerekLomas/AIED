Here's my thinking process to arrive at the estimate:

1.  **Analyze the Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"
    *   **Task 1 (Recall/Selection):** Identify *a line* from the poem. This requires having read and retained *some* line, or at least being able to copy one from memory or a provided text (though a poem isn't provided here, so it relies on memory).
    *   **Task 2 (Expression/Reasoning):** Explain *why* they like it. This requires some level of comprehension and the ability to articulate a personal opinion in English.

2.  **Analyze the Target Audience:** Class 6 students in Indian government schools, mostly economically weaker sections, limited English. Average pass rate ~29%.

3.  **Break Down Potential Difficulties:**
    *   **Recalling a line:** Even if they read the poem "The Last Bargain" (which was an item in the calibration, 5% pass rate for theme), remembering a *specific line* might be hard. They might remember the gist, but not exact wording. If they just write a general idea, it won't meet the "denotes a line" part of the rubric.
    *   **Limited English:**
        *   "Which line... do you like the most": This phrasing is fairly common, but "denotes a line" (rubric) means they need to actually write the line.
        *   "and why?": This is the biggest hurdle. Articulating a *reason* for liking something, even a simple one, in English, is difficult for students with limited vocabulary and grammatical structures. Many might only be able to say "because it is good" or "because I like it," which might score low or not at all depending on the nuance of the rubric's "mentions why."
    *   **Novelty/Anxiety:** This isn't a straightforward recall question. It asks for personal preference and justification, which some students might not be used to expressing in an academic setting, especially in a second language. Blank responses are a risk.
    *   **Prerequisite Knowledge:** The question assumes they've read and understood "The Last Bargain." The 5% pass rate for "theme" suggests very low comprehension for the poem itself. If they can't even get the theme, how can they pick a favorite line and explain why?

4.  **Calibrate Against Anchors:**

    *   **5% - "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"** This is about conceptual understanding. Very few got this right. This question *also* relates to "The Last Bargain." If only 5% can grasp the *theme*, then the number who can recall a *specific line* and articulate a *personal reason* for liking it will likely be even lower for the "why" part, but perhaps slightly higher for just picking a line. However, the combined task is tough.
    *   **15% - "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."** This requires factual knowledge and comparative analysis. More structured.
    *   **30% - "Write a short paragraph... 'My favorite season.'"** This is a personal descriptive task, much closer in *type* to the current question (personal opinion + justification/description). Students could often string together *some* relevant words ("Winter, Sweater, Baju, Hot water, Tea") even if not a coherent paragraph. The "why" part of our current question is *harder* than just listing things for a season. The "short paragraph" (6-8 lines) requirement was a high bar for 30%.
    *   **50% - "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This is pure recall of a specific plot point. If they read the story, it's fairly direct. Our question requires more than just recall.
    *   **66% - "Name any two Fundamental Rights..."** This is direct recall of factual information, well-taught in civics. High pass rate suggests this type of question is manageable for many.

5.  **Synthesize and Estimate:**

    *   The connection to "The Last Bargain" (5% theme pass rate) is a major red flag. If students barely understand the poem, they won't remember lines or have a meaningful reason to like one.
    *   The closest analogy is "My favorite season" (30%), which allowed for somewhat fragmented responses to get partial credit. Our current question requires two distinct parts:
        1.  **Denote a line:** This could be copying, or partial recall. Maybe 10-15% could manage to write *a* line, even if
