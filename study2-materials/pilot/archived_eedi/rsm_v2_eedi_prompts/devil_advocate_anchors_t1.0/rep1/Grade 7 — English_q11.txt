The question asks students to identify an adjective phrase, but the rubric only requires them to identify "tiny" as an adjective. This mismatch significantly affects the pass rate, as identifying a single adjective is much easier than identifying an adjective *phrase*.

Let's consider the difficulty based on the rubric: identifying "tiny" as an adjective.

*   **Limited English:** "Tiny" is a relatively common adjective. Even students with limited English might recognize it or be able to pick out the word describing the bird.
*   **"Basic" Concepts:** Adjectives are a fundamental part of grammar. While "adjective phrase" might be complex, "adjective" itself is often taught early.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** While anxiety is a factor, single-word identification questions often lead to fewer blank responses than open-ended questions.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** Identifying a single word in a short sentence is a common grammar exercise.

Let's compare to calibration anchors:

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of a poem.** This requires complex comprehension and expressive writing. "Tiny" identification is much simpler.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological/literary sources.** Requires recall of definitions and examples, and comparative thinking. More complex than identifying "tiny."
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Short paragraph on "My favorite season."** Requires sustained writing, organizing thoughts, and specific details. Much harder.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer.** This requires recall of specific details from a story. If they remember the story, they can get it. Identifying "tiny" is similar in that it's a direct identification.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name two Fundamental Rights.** This requires specific factual recall. Again, if they know it, they get it. This is probably the closest in type, though "tiny" is less about factual recall and more about basic linguistic function.

The key challenge for this question is the term "adjective phrase" itself. If students fixate on finding a *phrase* and don't realize the rubric only wants the adjective "tiny," they might struggle. However, given the rubric only scores "tiny" as an adjective, it simplifies significantly.

Many students might just pick "tiny" because it describes the bird, even if they don't fully grasp "adjective phrase." The sentence is short and simple.

Considering the average pass rate is 29%, and this question, if interpreted by the rubric, is a relatively straightforward identification task for a single common word, it should be significantly higher than 29%. It's likely easier than recalling two fundamental rights for students who might struggle with civics. It's probably on par with or slightly easier than recalling the king's three questions if they've grasped what an adjective is.

Let's re-evaluate the "adjective phrase" vs "adjective" issue. If the question truly asked for an adjective *phrase* and the rubric awarded points only for "tiny" (a single adjective), there would be a disconnect. The most common adjective phrase in this sentence, if one were to stretch, could be "a tiny bird" but that is not an adjective phrase modifying "bird". "Tiny" is the adjective. If students are trained to identify *phrases*, they might be confused. However, in many contexts, especially with limited instruction, "adjective phrase" might be loosely understood as "the adjective" or "the words that describe."

Given the calibration anchors, and the simplicity of the word "tiny" and the short sentence, if students have even a basic understanding of what an adjective does (describes a noun), they have a good chance. The critical element is that the rubric only asks for "tiny" and not a complex phrase.

I'd place it higher than 50% because "tiny" is an accessible word and the task is specific and simple, unlike open-ended writing or complex differentiation. It's similar to the 50% item in that it asks for specific information from a given text, but it's grammatical rather than narrative recall. The 66% item required recall of specific facts. Identifying "tiny" is a skill-based question rather than pure recall, but a relatively basic skill.

I'll lean towards the higher end of the difficulty scale for single-word identification, considering the general low pass rates and the potential confusion of "adjective phrase" versus "adjective."
