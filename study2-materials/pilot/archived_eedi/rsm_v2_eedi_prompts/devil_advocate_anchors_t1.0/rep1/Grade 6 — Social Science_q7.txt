I will break down the thinking process to arrive at the calibrated estimate.

**1. Initial Gut Feeling (and why it's probably wrong):**

*   **First thought:** Rajasthan is known for its desert, so sand and maybe some minerals. Water is a natural resource everywhere. Students should know about the Thar desert. Mentioning two resources seems easy, and linking one to people's lives (e.g., water scarcity impacting farming) also seems straightforward. Maybe 40-50%?

**2. Applying the "Challenge Your Instinct" Filter and Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"Limited English"**:
    *   The question asks for "explain how one of them influences the lives." This requires more than just naming. It requires forming a coherent sentence or two.
    *   Look at the "My favorite season" example (30% pass rate). Even simple paragraph writing, with prompts, yields only 30%. This question is conceptually harder.
    *   Look at "The Last Bargain" theme (5% pass rate). Explaining a concept is very difficult for these students.
*   **"Basic concepts aren't basic"**:
    *   "Natural resources" might be a taught concept, but recalling *specific* ones for Rajasthan and then explaining their *influence* is a multi-step cognitive task.
    *   The "Fundamental Rights" question (66% pass rate) is about recalling two specific, rote-learned facts. This question is similar in *recall* difficulty for the resources, but the *explanation* part adds a layer of complexity.
    *   The "Archaeological vs. Literary sources" (15% pass rate) requires differentiation and examples, which is a higher-order skill. This "explain how one influences" is similar in its demands.
*   **"Exam anxiety / blank responses"**: Students who are unsure about the explanation part might just leave it blank or only list resources without explaining, thus failing the "explain" part of the rubric.
*   **"Never practiced this exact question type"**: While they might have learned about resources or Rajasthan, the combination of naming *two* *specific* to a region and then *explaining the influence* of *one* is a specific demand.
*   **"Rubric check"**: The rubric requires *both* two resources *and* an explanation for one to get credit. If they only list two resources, they get 0. This is crucial.

**3. Comparing to Anchors more directly:**

*   **Fundamental Rights (66%)**: Rote recall of two specific facts. This question requires *some* recall (two resources) *plus* an explanation. The explanation part significantly lowers the difficulty.
*   **King's Three Questions (50%)**: Rote recall of three specific facts. Again, similar to the "two resources" part, but still *more* to do with the explanation.
*   **My Favorite Season (30%)**: Writing a short paragraph about a personal topic, with prompts. This is *much* easier than explaining the influence of a natural resource on a region's people, especially given the English limitations. The English demand for the "explanation" here is higher than just describing a season.
*   **Archaeological vs. Literary Sources (15%)**: Differentiating and giving examples. This involves conceptual understanding and application. The "explanation" part of our target question feels closer to this level of difficulty, perhaps a little easier if the resource is very obvious (like water).
*   **The Last Bargain Theme (5%)**: Explaining a theme from a poem. This is abstract and very difficult. Our question isn't *that* abstract, but the explanation still poses a challenge.

**4. Refining the Estimate:**

*   The need to name *two* resources *and* provide an *explanation* for one, all while dealing with limited English and potential anxiety, makes this harder than the 30% "Favorite Season" question.
*   Many students might name "Water" and "Sand," but then struggle to articulate "how it influences lives" in a clear, correct English sentence. They might say "water is important for farming" which *could* pass, but many might fail to elaborate or make mistakes.
*   The "two resources + explanation" is a higher bar than just recalling two facts (like Fundamental Rights or King's questions).
*   It's not as abstract or difficult as "The Last Bargain," but it's more demanding than the simple paragraph writing.

*   **Target Difficulty:** It sits somewhere between "My favorite season" (30%) and "Archaeological/Literary sources" (15%). The explanation part is the bottleneck. If they only list resources, they get 0. If they list
