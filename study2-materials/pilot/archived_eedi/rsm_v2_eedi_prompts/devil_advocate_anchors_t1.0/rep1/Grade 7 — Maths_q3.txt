I will use the provided calibration anchors and insights to estimate the proportion of Class 7 students who would correctly answer the question about the area of a triangle.

**Analyzing the Question:**

*   **Concept:** Area of a triangle. This is a fundamental concept in geometry, usually introduced by Class 7.
*   **Formula:** `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. This is a specific formula they need to recall and apply.
*   **Numbers:** Simple integers (8 cm, 6 cm). Calculation is straightforward (1/2 * 8 * 6 = 24).
*   **English:** "Find the area of a triangle whose base is 8 cm and height is 6 cm." The language is relatively clear and direct, with key mathematical terms.
*   **Rubric:** States or uses the correct formula. This means they don't necessarily need to calculate the correct answer, but just show they know the formula. This makes it slightly easier than needing the final answer.

**Challenging Initial Assumptions & Comparing to Anchors:**

My initial instinct might be that this is a fairly basic math problem, and many students should know the formula. However, the calibration anchors highlight several crucial points:

1.  **Limited English:** While the question's English is simple, struggling students might still misinterpret "base" or "height" if they haven't thoroughly grasped the terms in English or if their foundational understanding is weak.
2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for All:** For students from economically weaker sections and with inconsistent schooling, even fundamental geometry formulas might not be firmly committed to memory or understood conceptually. Some might have been absent, or the teaching might have been rote without deep understanding.
3.  **Recall vs. Recognition:** This question requires *recall* of a specific formula, not just recognition.
4.  **Analogies to Anchors:**
    *   **5% (Theme of a poem):** This is highly interpretive and requires advanced English comprehension and critical thinking. The triangle question is much less abstract.
    *   **15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires comparing two distinct concepts and providing examples. This is analytical and depends heavily on social science knowledge, which can be patchy. The triangle question is a direct application of a single formula.
    *   **30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires creative writing, sentence construction, and sustained expression in English. Many students struggle with this, as seen by fragmented or very short answers. The triangle question is much more constrained and formulaic.
    *   **50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is a recall question from a specific story. It requires memory of a narrative detail and converting it into a list. This is similar in its "recall and state" nature to recalling a formula. However, remembering three *specific* questions might be slightly harder than one mathematical formula, especially if they haven't revised the story recently.
    *   **66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This also requires recall of specific information (names of rights) from civics. The English is simple (e.g., "Right to equality"). The key difference here is *two* rights, and the concepts might feel more directly relevant or discussed in their social environment. Many students often learn a few key rights.

**Revisiting the Estimate:**

*   **Formula Recall:** This is the core challenge. Many students might struggle to recall the exact `1/2` component or might mix it up with the area of a rectangle (`base × height`).
*   **Application:** Once the formula is recalled, the calculation is trivial. The rubric focuses solely on the formula.
*   **English Simplicity:** The English is definitely easier than the paragraph writing or theme interpretation questions.
*   **Comparison to 50% (King's questions):** The king's questions require recalling three distinct points. The triangle formula requires one specific formula. Both are recall. I'd argue that the triangle formula is perhaps *slightly* more universally taught and practiced in math class than recalling specific plot points from a story, *if* they were paying attention. However, the "1/2" is a common point of error.
*   **Comparison to 66% (Fundamental Rights):** Naming two rights seems slightly easier than recalling a precise math formula with a fraction, especially since rights might be discussed more broadly.

Considering the common difficulties:
*   Forgetting the `1/2`.
*   Mixing it up with a rectangle's area.
*   Simply not remembering the formula at all.
*   Some might write the correct formula but then mess up the calculation, which for this rubric, still counts as correct.

Given the 50% anchor for recalling three specific
