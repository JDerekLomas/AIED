I need to estimate the pass rate for the question: "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?" based on the provided calibration anchors and important considerations.

Let's break down the question and the likely student responses:

*   **Content Knowledge:** The Battle of Plassey is a foundational topic in Indian history for Class 8. Students would have encountered it. However, "contribution to the expansion of British power" requires more than just knowing *what* happened; it requires understanding the *consequence* in terms of British dominance.
*   **English Proficiency:** The question uses terms like "contribute," "expansion," and "British power," which are relatively common in history texts. However, formulating an explanation in English, even a simple one, can be a hurdle.
*   **Cognitive Demand:** This is a cause-and-effect question. It requires linking an event (Battle of Plassey) to a consequence (expansion of British power). This is more complex than just recalling facts (like naming rights) but less open-ended than writing a theme or differentiating concepts with examples.
*   **Rubric:** The rubric is quite specific: "explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." This means a student needs to explicitly connect the *victory* to *political control* or *dominance* in Bengal. Simply stating "British won" or "Mir Jafar became nawab" without the connection to British power might not get a full point.

Let's compare this to the anchors:

*   **5% Anchor (Theme of poem):** This requires deep comprehension and abstract thinking, plus nuanced expression. The Plassey question is less abstract.
*   **15% Anchor (Differentiate sources):** This requires recalling definitions and providing examples, which is factual recall with structured application. The Plassey question requires a bit more synthesis. Many students struggle with *differentiation* itself.
*   **30% Anchor (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This is a creative writing task requiring personal expression and adherence to structural guidelines (6-8 lines, specific topics). The examples show a mix of success, from keyword lists to short sentences. The Plassey question is more factual.
*   **50% Anchor (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is direct recall of specific facts from a story. If students remember the story, they can get this. The Plassey question is also recall, but of a consequence/impact, not just specific items in a list.
*   **66% Anchor (Name two Fundamental Rights):** This is direct recall of specific, well-drilled factual information. Students just need to list two. The Plassey question requires a more structured answer than just a list.

**Challenging Assumptions:**

*   **"Basic concept":** While Plassey is basic history, understanding its *contribution to power expansion* requires a conceptual leap that many struggling students might miss. They might just say "British won" or "Mir Jafar became king," without articulating the *dominance*.
*   **Limited English:** Expressing "political dominance" or "control" in simple English could be hard. They might use simpler phrases like "British became powerful" or "British ruled Bengal." The rubric is quite accommodating ("dominance/control").
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** This is always a factor. Some students will leave it blank.
*   **Exact Question Type:** This isn't just "What was the Battle of Plassey?" It's "How did it *contribute*?" This requires an explanatory answer.

**Initial Thought Process & Calibration:**

The question asks for a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Students *should* know that Plassey was a British victory and led to control over Bengal. The key is expressing that connection in English.

*   It's harder than merely listing facts (50%, 66% anchors).
*   It's easier than abstract interpretation (5% anchor) or structured differentiation (15% anchor).
*   It's a factual explanation, distinct from personal narrative (30% anchor).

Many students might write something like:
*   "British won the war of Plassey and got power in Bengal." (Likely 1 point)
*   "After Plassey, British controlled Bengal and became strong." (Likely 1 point)
*   "Mir Jafar became Nawab but British was ruling." (Likely 1 point)
*   "British became more powerful." (Might be too vague, depending on strictness, but often gets a point if "after Plassey" is implied/stated)
*   "British fought Plas
