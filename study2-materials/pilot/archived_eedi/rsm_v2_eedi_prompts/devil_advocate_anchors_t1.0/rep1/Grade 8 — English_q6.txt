Here's my calibrated estimate for the "Define fable" question:

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%**

Here's my reasoning, challenging my initial assumptions:

*   **Initial Instinct vs. Reality:** My initial instinct was higher, perhaps 40-50%, thinking "fable" is a common literary term. However, the calibration anchors strongly suggest this is overly optimistic for this student demographic.

*   **Limited English Proficiency:** The key phrase "Define fable" requires not just recognition but the ability to articulate a definition in English. Even if they understand the *concept* of a fable (perhaps from stories told in their native language), expressing it accurately in English, covering both key components (animals as characters, moral lesson), is a significant hurdle. Many might only get one part, or struggle to form a coherent sentence.

*   **"Basic Concepts" Aren't Basic:** While "fable" might be considered a basic literary term in a more privileged English-medium school, for students with an average pass rate of 29% and limited English, it's not a given. They might have encountered fables (like Panchatantra stories), but linking the *concept* to the *English term* and then articulating a formal definition is much harder.

*   **Analogy to Calibration Anchors:**
    *   **"Theme of The Last Bargain" (5%):** This requires abstract thinking and articulation. While "fable" is less abstract, it still requires precise definition.
    *   **"Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" (15%):** This involves defining two terms and comparing them, which is more complex than defining one. However, the examples show students struggle even with basic factual recall and articulation.
    *   **"My favorite season" (30%):** This is a personal response, allowing for simpler language and more leeway in expression. Even then, many responses are basic or incomplete. Defining a specific term is less forgiving.
    *   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%):** This is direct recall of specific details from a story likely taught in class. It's much easier than synthesizing a definition.
    *   **"Fundamental Rights" (66%):** This is direct recall of a taught list, often rote-learned.

*   **Rubric Strictness:** The rubric requires "typically uses animals as characters AND imparts a moral lesson." Getting both correct in decent English will be challenging. Many might only mention one aspect, or provide a definition that is too vague to score.

*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** Given the low overall pass rate, a significant proportion of students will either leave it blank or attempt a very poor answer due to anxiety or not knowing the term at all.

Considering these factors, 20% seems a reasonable estimate. It's higher than the most difficult items (5-15%) because "fable" is a single concept and potentially more accessible than differentiating between two complex historical sources, but significantly lower than recall questions (50-66%) due to the articulation requirement and language barrier.
