Here's my thinking process to arrive at the estimate:

1.  **Analyze the Question:**
    *   "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."
    *   Requires recall of specific geographical facts.
    *   The prompt specifies "two," but the rubric says "names one correct mountain range" for a max score of 0.5. This means a student gets partial credit for just one correct answer. This significantly increases the pass rate compared to needing two.
    *   The language is relatively simple ("Name," "two," "major," "mountain ranges," "India").

2.  **Consider the Target Audience:**
    *   Class 6 students, Indian government schools.
    *   Economically weaker sections.
    *   Limited English.
    *   Average pass rate for the *exam* is 29%. This is a crucial baseline.

3.  **Consult Calibration Anchors (and lessons learned from them):**

    *   **5% (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** Abstract thinking, interpretation, good English writing needed. Very hard.
    *   **15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, comparison, examples. Moderate English, but complex thinking.
    *   **30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires personal expression, structured writing (6-8 lines), specific details. Students struggle with *length* and *structure*, even on a familiar topic. The examples show fragmented thoughts or very short responses.
    *   **50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Direct recall of specific plot points from a story. Simple English, but requires good memory of a specific text. *Crucially, it's about recall, similar to my target question.*
    *   **66% (Name any two Fundamental Rights):** Direct recall of specific civic facts. Requires knowledge of the constitution. Simple English. The examples show students providing *one* correct answer or two, even with slight spelling errors. This is *very* similar in structure and cognitive demand to my target question.

4.  **Compare Target Question to Anchors:**

    *   **Similarity to 66% (Fundamental Rights):** Both questions require naming two specific items from a known list. Both are direct recall of factual knowledge. The English is simple. The rubric for my target question gives 0.5 for *one* correct answer, making it even more lenient than needing two for a full score. Knowing *one* major Indian mountain range (e.g., Himalayas) is highly probable if they've studied Indian geography at all.
    *   **Similarity to 50% (King's questions):** Also direct recall, but from a story. Geography is often taught repeatedly.
    *   **Difference from 30% (Favorite Season):** My question doesn't require creative writing, paragraph structure, or extended English production. It's just listing.
    *   **Difference from 15% and 5%:** My question doesn't require complex analysis, differentiation, or abstract themes.

5.  **Challenge Initial Instincts:**

    *   My initial instinct might be "Most students would know the Himalayas, so this should be high."
    *   *Challenge:* "Limited English" -> but the English needed is minimal. "Basic concepts aren't basic" -> but geography is fundamental. "Exam anxiety" -> could lead to blanks, yes, but if they know *one* range, they get credit. "Never practiced this exact question type" -> but "naming two things" is a common assessment style.

6.  **Refine the Estimate based on the most relevant anchor:**

    *   The "Fundamental Rights" question (66%) is the closest match in terms of cognitive demand (recall of specific facts), language simplicity, and requiring "two" but often accepting partial answers.
    *   Geography (major mountain ranges in *their own country*) is arguably *more* foundational and frequently reinforced than specific constitutional rights for Class 6 students. They'd see maps, learn about physical features.
    *   The rubric for *my* question is particularly forgiving: just *one* correct answer out of many possibilities (Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats) gets credit. Almost any student who has paid a minimal amount of attention in a geography class should be able to recall at least the Himalayas.

7.  **Final Calibration:**
    Given the strong similarity to the 66% anchor, and the slightly *easier* nature of recalling a major geographical feature of their own country compared to specific legal rights, *and* the very lenient scoring (only one needed for 0.5 points), I would place
