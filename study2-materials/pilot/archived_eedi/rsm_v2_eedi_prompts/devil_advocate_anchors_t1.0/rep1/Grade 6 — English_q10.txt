I'm going to carefully consider the calibration anchors and the profile of the students.

*   **Student Profile:** Class 6 students in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate around 29%. This means a significant portion will struggle with basic English grammar, even if they have encountered "some/any" before.
*   **Item Type:** A fill-in-the-blank grammar question, specifically choosing between "some" and "any." This is a fundamental concept in English for expressing quantity in affirmative vs. negative/interrogative sentences.
*   **Difficulty of "some/any":** While "some/any" is taught early, distinguishing when to use each can be tricky for learners, especially those with limited exposure and practice. The sentence "There are (some/any) apples in the basket" is an affirmative statement, so "some" is correct.
*   **Calibration Anchors Analysis:**
    *   **5% pass rate (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expression in English. Very difficult.
    *   **15% pass rate (Differentiate sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, recall of examples, and comparative thinking. Hard.
    *   **30% pass rate (Paragraph on favorite season):** Requires creative writing, sentence construction, and adherence to prompts. Moderate difficulty, but many struggle with expressing themselves. The given examples show very basic, sometimes fragmented, responses that still score points.
    *   **50% pass rate (King's three questions):** Requires recall of specific information from a text. Simpler recall, but still relies on reading comprehension.
    *   **66% pass rate (Two Fundamental Rights):** Requires recall of specific factual information. One of the easier recall tasks, as these are likely emphasized. Even here, some responses are entirely incorrect.

**Challenging my assumptions:**
My first instinct might be that "some/any" is basic and many students should get this. However, the calibration anchors show that even seemingly simple recall questions (like the king's questions) only get 50% correct. Grammar nuances, especially for students with limited English, are often harder than recalling facts.

*   **Limited English:** Many students will not have a deep intuitive grasp of "some" for affirmative and "any" for negative/questions. They might guess, or simply not know the rule.
*   **"Basic" concepts:** What's basic to a native speaker or a strong English learner is not basic for a struggling learner. This grammatical distinction can be a common point of error.
*   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** Even for a simple question, some students might freeze or not attempt it, though a multiple-choice-like format might encourage a guess.
*   **Lack of practice:** They might have been taught it but haven't practiced it enough to solidify the rule.

The question is a straightforward application of a common grammar rule. It's not abstract (like the poem's theme) or complex (like differentiating sources). It's simpler than writing a paragraph. It's more about knowing a rule than recalling a specific fact, but the rule itself is relatively simple.

Comparing it to the anchors:
*   It's definitely easier than the 5% and 15% items.
*   It's probably easier than the 30% item, as writing a paragraph requires more sustained linguistic output and creativity. This is a single choice.
*   It's comparable to or slightly easier than the 50% item (King's questions), which is pure recall. This is recall of a grammar rule.
*   It's likely harder than the 66% item (Fundamental Rights), as those are very specific, likely drilled facts. Grammar rules, even simple ones, require a bit more cognitive processing and application.

Given the limited English proficiency and the general struggle with even basic recall, a pass rate significantly above 50% seems optimistic. However, "some/any" is a very frequently used pair, and this specific sentence structure ("There are... apples") is also common. It's likely taught and practiced, even if not perfectly internalized by all.

I'd place it somewhere between the 50% and 66% anchors, leaning towards the lower end of that range because it's a grammatical rule application rather than pure factual recall of something like a right. Many will get it by rote or by recognizing the common phrase. But the "any" trap will catch a good chunk of others.

Final calibrated estimate: A little above the 50% recall question, but not as high as the most straightforward factual recall.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
