I will analyze the question and rubric in the context of the calibration anchors and student profile.

**Question Analysis:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."
*   **Part 1: "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life?"** This requires a simple "yes" or "no" (or implied agreement). The passage itself outlines the king's questions: "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with." Students would have encountered these questions earlier in the same exam (as seen in the 50% pass rate anchor).
*   **Part 2: "Give one reason."** This requires a simple justification. The reason doesn't need to be complex or profound, just a basic logical connection to why these questions are important.

**Student Profile & Challenges:**
*   Mostly from economically weaker sections.
*   Limited English proficiency.
*   Average pass rate 29%.
*   Exam anxiety leading to blank responses.
*   "Basic" concepts are not basic.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea...** This requires interpretation and abstract thinking, which is hard.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources...** This requires recall of specific definitions and examples, and comparison, which is moderately difficult.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph on "My favorite season."** This is a creative writing task with prompts, but requires coherent sentence formation. Many responses are very short or list-like.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is direct recall from the text. Students who understood the passage could simply copy or rephrase the questions. Even with limited English, identifying key phrases is possible. This is a very strong anchor because it refers to the *same content* as the target question.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights...** This is direct recall of specific facts. While "Fundamental Rights" might be a complex concept, naming two is a relatively low bar for a memorized fact.

**Target Question Difficulty Assessment:**

1.  **Understanding the King's Questions:** The 50% pass rate for "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" suggests that about half the students *could* identify or recall these questions. This is crucial because the target question *presumes* knowledge of those questions.
2.  **"Important in real life?"**: This is a very subjective and simple "yes/no" question. Most students will likely agree they are important.
3.  **"Give one reason."**: This is the trickiest part.
    *   **Low English proficiency impact:** Can a student with limited English articulate *any* reason? Examples: "Because if we know the right time, we will be successful." "Because it helps us." "Good life." Even very broken English might get a point if the meaning is clear.
    *   **Cognitive load:** It doesn't require deep analysis. It asks for a personal opinion and a basic justification.
    *   **Anxiety/Blank responses:** Some will still leave it blank.
    *   **Connection to King's questions:** Students might struggle to link the *reason* directly to *all three* questions, but a general reason for their importance should suffice. The rubric states "Any valid reason."

**Comparing to Anchors:**
*   It's *easier* than the 5% (abstract theme) and 15% (differentiate).
*   It's likely *harder* than the 66% (direct factual recall of memorized rights), as it requires a simple thought process beyond pure memory.
*   It's *comparable to or slightly easier* than the 50% anchor if we consider that students who successfully recalled the questions are now being asked to give a basic opinion on them. The previous question assessed if they *knew* the questions; this one asks for a simple *value judgment* and *reason* about them.

If 50% could recall the questions, then perhaps a slightly higher percentage could manage a simple "yes" and a very basic, even broken, reason for their importance. The "Any valid reason" part of the rubric is very forgiving. Even "it helps us" or "to make good decisions" would likely score a 1.

Given the limited English, the challenge is articulation, not necessarily conceptual understanding of "importance." Many might struggle to form a coherent sentence but have the basic idea.
