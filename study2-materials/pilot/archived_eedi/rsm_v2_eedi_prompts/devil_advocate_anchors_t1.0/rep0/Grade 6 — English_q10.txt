I'll analyze the question and calibration anchors to estimate the pass rate.

**Question Analysis:**
The question tests the usage of "some" vs. "any" in an affirmative sentence. This is a fundamental concept in English grammar, often taught early in English language learning. However, it's also a common point of confusion for second-language learners, especially those with limited exposure to English outside of school.

**Considerations for Class 6 Indian Government School Students:**
*   **Limited English:** This is the most crucial factor. While "some/any" is basic, it relies on an understanding of sentence types (affirmative, negative, interrogative). Students with weak foundational English might struggle to differentiate or apply the rule consistently.
*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** This often correlates with less exposure to English in the home environment or through external resources (books, media), making classroom learning their primary, and often only, source.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** As noted, this is a significant factor. A student might *know* the answer but get flustered.
*   **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** While they might have learned the rule, seeing it in a fill-in-the-blank format might be new or challenging for some.

**Comparing with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** This requires abstract thinking, literary interpretation, and expressing a complex idea in English. Extremely difficult.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, recall, and the ability to articulate differences with examples. More demanding than a simple fill-in-the-blank.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires sentence construction, vocabulary, and sustained writing. Many students struggle with expressing themselves beyond simple sentences, even on familiar topics.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is a direct recall question from a story, likely taught in class. It's challenging because it requires memory of specific details and the ability to transcribe them, but it's less about complex grammar or interpretation. The fact that 50% got it right suggests that straightforward recall (even if imperfectly transcribed) is attainable for many.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Another recall question, but from Civics/Social Studies, which might be a more structured and memorized topic. It requires remembering specific terms (e.g., "Right to equality," "Right to freedom"). The high pass rate suggests that direct recall of specific names/phrases is relatively manageable if taught well.

**Re-evaluating "some/any":**

The "some/any" question is a direct application of a grammatical rule. It's simpler than writing a paragraph, differentiating concepts, or interpreting a poem. It's more akin to the recall questions (king's questions, fundamental rights) in terms of being a single, definite answer, but it tests grammar application rather than factual recall.

The challenge lies in the "any" trap. Students might overgeneralize "any" for all situations or might not distinguish between affirmative and negative/interrogative uses. However, "There are apples in the basket" is a very common sentence structure.

Given that 50% can recall three specific questions from a story and 66% can name two fundamental rights, a fundamental grammar rule applied to a simple, common sentence structure should fare better than the lower-difficulty items. It's less demanding than sustained writing (30%) or conceptual differentiation (15%). It's also less abstract than identifying a theme (5%).

The critical factor is the explicit teaching of "some" for affirmative sentences and "any" for negative/interrogative. If this rule was drilled, many would get it. If it was only briefly covered or not practiced, many would guess or make common errors.

I initially thought it would be quite high, perhaps 70-80%, because it's "basic." But the calibration anchors clearly show that "basic" for an expert is not basic for these students. The 50% and 66% anchors are *recall* based. This question requires *application*.

A student who struggles with basic reading might misinterpret the question or not recognize the words. However, "There are ____ apples in the basket" is a very simple sentence.

Considering the limited English proficiency and the tendency for blank or incorrect responses due to anxiety or lack of understanding, it won't be as high as 66% (direct recall of learned terms). It's probably higher than 30% (paragraph writing) as it's a single choice.

It's closer to the 50% mark
