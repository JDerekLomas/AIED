I will estimate the proportion of Class 7 students in Indian government schools who would answer the given question correctly.

**Analyzing the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it."
*   **Rubric:** "Student writes a complete paragraph that clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable." (Max score: 1)

**Key Challenges for Students:**

1.  **English Proficiency:** The primary hurdle. Students need to construct grammatically coherent sentences, use appropriate vocabulary for their hobby and reasons, and link them into a paragraph.
2.  **Paragraph Structure:** "Short paragraph (4-5 sentences)" implies a degree of structure. Many students might struggle to write more than a few fragmented sentences or bullet points.
3.  **Content Requirements:** They need to explicitly cover "what it is," "when you do it," and "why you enjoy it." Missing one component might lead to a lower score, though the rubric is "score 1" if all are present.
4.  **Vocabulary:** While "hobby" is a common word, explaining *why* they enjoy it might require slightly more abstract vocabulary (e.g., "relaxing," "creative," "learn new things").
5.  **Lack of Practice:** As noted, many students haven't practiced this *exact* question type, especially combining multiple requirements into a structured paragraph.
6.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** This is a consistent factor.

**Comparing with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5%:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" - Requires abstract thought, literary analysis, and strong English. Much harder.
*   **Pass rate 15%:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." - Requires understanding of two distinct concepts, differentiation, and providing examples. More factual recall with explanation.
*   **Pass rate 30%:** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.' Talk about what you like to do, what you eat or wear, and w" - This is the *closest* anchor.
    *   **Similarities:** Paragraph writing, personal topic, multiple content requirements (do, eat/wear).
    *   **Differences:**
        *   "My favorite season" is arguably easier to describe ("Winter, Sweater, Baju, Hot water, Tea") than explaining a hobby *and* why one enjoys it, which might demand a slightly higher level of expression.
        *   The length requirement here is 4-5 sentences, compared to 6-8 lines for "favorite season." While shorter, fulfilling all *three* specific criteria (what, when, why) in coherent sentences is still challenging.
        *   The "favorite season" example shows responses that barely scrape a pass by listing items. For "hobby," explaining "why you enjoy it" requires more than a simple list.
*   **Pass rate 50%:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" - Direct recall from a story. Simpler English, direct answer.
*   **Pass rate 66%:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights..." - Direct factual recall. Easiest type.

**Challenging Initial Instinct:**

My first instinct might be that "My Favourite Hobby" is a relatively simple, personal topic. However, considering the calibration anchors and the specific challenges:

*   The "My favorite season" item, which is very similar in type, has a 30% pass rate. This question (My Favourite Hobby) is slightly *more* demanding in terms of the *depth* of explanation required ("why you enjoy it") compared to merely listing things done/worn/eaten in a season.
*   The length is slightly shorter (4-5 sentences vs. 6-8 lines), which might seem easier, but the requirement to hit all three points (what, when, why) clearly in complete sentences is still a significant hurdle for students with limited English.
*   Many might write "My hobby is playing cricket. I play everyday. I like it." This is three sentences, covers the what/when, but "I like it" is a very weak explanation for "why you enjoy it" and might not fully satisfy the rubric. To elaborate on "why" ("it is fun," "I feel relaxed," "I like to score runs") requires more vocabulary.
*   The example responses for "My favorite season" show very basic sentence structures or just lists. "My f\nI" scored 0, indicating a complete inability to form a paragraph.

Given the 30% pass rate for "
