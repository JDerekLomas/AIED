I will use the provided calibration anchors to estimate the pass rate for the given question.

**Analysis of the Question:**
The question asks to find the area of a triangle given its base and height. This requires knowing the formula for the area of a triangle and performing a simple multiplication and division.

*   **Mathematical Concept:** Basic geometry, specifically the area of a triangle.
*   **Formula Recall:** Students need to recall `Area = 1/2 × base × height`.
*   **Calculation:** `1/2 × 8 × 6 = 24`.
*   **Language Difficulty:** The language is very straightforward: "Find the area of a triangle whose base is X cm and height is Y cm." This is about as simple as a math word problem gets in English.
*   **Prerequisites:** Students would have covered basic geometry formulas in Class 6 or 7.

**Comparing to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"** This requires abstract thinking, literary interpretation, and expressing a complex idea in English. This is significantly harder than the target question.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each."** This requires understanding two abstract historical concepts, differentiating them, and providing examples, all while articulating it in English. This is also harder than the target question.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'"** This requires creative writing, organizing thoughts, and writing several coherent sentences in English. While seemingly simple, many students struggle with expressing themselves beyond very basic sentences. The target question is more formulaic.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This is a direct recall question from a specific text. If students have read and understood the story, it's easy. If not, it's impossible. This relies heavily on memory of a specific narrative, which is often better than recalling a general formula. The English comprehension needed is moderate.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India."** This is a direct recall of a factual list. Many students might be able to recall these from civics classes, often by rote memorization in their local language and then translating. The English required is minimal (just listing names).

**Estimating Difficulty:**

The target question is a direct application of a formula.
*   **Formula Recall:** Students are expected to know this formula by Class 7. Those who have a basic grasp of mathematics and attend class regularly should know it.
*   **Calculation:** The numbers are small and the calculation is simple.
*   **English Comprehension:** The English is very basic and unlikely to be a significant barrier for most students, even those with limited English. The key terms "area," "base," and "height" are standard math vocabulary.

This question is significantly easier than the literary analysis (5%) and historical differentiation (15%). It's also less demanding in terms of English paragraph writing than "My favorite season" (30%).

It's comparable in *type* to the "three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%) in that it's a direct recall/application, but the formula is a core mathematical concept that's likely taught repeatedly and is less dependent on memorizing a single story. The "Fundamental Rights" (66%) is likely easier because it's pure recall of well-drilled civics facts, often learned by rote, with minimal linguistic output.

Given the average pass rate is 29%, and assuming students have some foundational math, recalling a basic geometry formula and applying it should be achievable for a good portion of the class. The language barrier is minimal here. Many students might struggle with complex English sentences but can often handle direct math problems with simple English.

I'd place it higher than the "My favorite season" (30%) because it's a specific mathematical task rather than open-ended writing, and the English needed is more constrained. It's likely slightly lower than the "Fundamental Rights" (66%) because formula recall can be weaker than rote factual recall, and there's a minor calculation step.

I anticipate that a good number of students will remember the formula, and the simple numbers prevent calculation errors. However, some will forget the formula, some might struggle with the "1/2" part, and some might simply leave it blank due to anxiety or lack of confidence.

I'll lean towards the higher end of the mid-range.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%
