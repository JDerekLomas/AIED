I will use the provided calibration anchors to estimate the pass rate for the given question.

The question asks: "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."
The rubric allows for a "Yes" or "No" answer to the first part, followed by "any valid reason." The "king's questions" referred to are "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with."

Let's break down the cognitive load and potential difficulties:

1.  **Understanding the question:** Students need to understand "important in real life" and "give one reason." This is relatively straightforward English, common in opinions/personal response questions.
2.  **Recalling the king's questions:** This is implicitly tested in the 50% pass rate anchor "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" Many students likely recall these or can infer them from the context of the story, even if they can't perfectly articulate them. The rubric for *this* question doesn't require stating the king's questions, only implicitly referring to their *importance*.
3.  **Formulating a "valid reason":** This is the core challenge.
    *   **"Yes, they are important":** Many students will intuitively grasp that making good decisions (right time, right thing, right people) is important. Reasons could be simple: "to be successful," "to avoid problems," "to do things correctly." These are very basic, universally understood concepts.
    *   **"No, they are not important":** While less likely, a student could argue this, but it would be harder to justify with a simple, coherent reason that gets a point.
    *   **English expression:** The reason needs to be expressed in English, even if broken. The 5% pass rate for "write a theme" shows very poor English can still get a point if the core idea is there. The 30% pass rate for "My favorite season" shows very minimal, broken sentences can get a point.

**Comparing to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."** This requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and articulation of a less concrete concept. Our target question is much more concrete ("important in real life?").
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each.** This requires factual recall of definitions and examples, and the ability to differentiate, which is a higher-order skill than stating an opinion.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season." Talk about what you like to do, what you eat or wear, and w.** This requires sustained writing, multiple ideas, and structuring a paragraph. Our target question only requires one sentence for the reason. However, it's a personal opinion, similar to our target question in that regard. Students struggle with generating multiple coherent sentences.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This requires direct recall from the passage. Our target question builds on understanding these questions but doesn't require their explicit recall. Many students could have a general idea of "making good decisions" without remembering the exact wording.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.** This is direct factual recall of specific names. It's a very straightforward question if the student has learned it.

**Reasoning for my estimate:**

1.  **Low cognitive demand:** The question asks for a simple "yes/no" opinion and a basic, intuitive reason. The *reason* is the key. Most students, even with limited English, can articulate a simple reason like "to be successful" or "to live better."
2.  **Relatability:** The concept of making good decisions (right time, right thing, right people) is universally relatable and important, even for students from weaker economic sections. They experience consequences of good/bad decisions daily.
3.  **Low English proficiency acceptance:** The rubric allows "any valid reason," and the calibration anchors show that very broken English or minimal phrasing can earn a point (e.g., "Happiness is find in innocence" for a theme, "Winter Sweater Baju Hot water Tea Gever feali Hat" for a paragraph). A student could write "Yes. For better life." and likely get a point.
4.  **No complex recall needed:** Unlike the "archaeological sources" or "theme" questions, this doesn't require specialized vocabulary or deep analytical skills. It's an opinion about a common-sense
