I'll analyze the question and compare it to the calibration anchors.

**Question Analysis:**
The question asks students to arrange four numbers in ascending order.
*   **Numbers:** 3367, 5492, 736, 4799
*   **Skill:** Number comparison and ordering. This involves understanding place value, especially differentiating between 3-digit and 4-digit numbers.
*   **Language:** "Arrange in ascending order" – this is a common mathematical instruction, but "ascending" might be a challenge for students with limited English. However, it's often taught visually or with examples in math class.
*   **Rubric:** Correctly identifying the smallest number (736) and placing it first. This is a very lenient rubric, meaning a partial understanding can get points.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.**
    *   This requires recall of specific facts. The language is straightforward. Students likely learn these in Civics/Social Studies. Many students get it right.
    *   Our question: Comparing numbers is arguably simpler than recalling specific facts, *if* the math concept is understood. The language is a bit more specific ("ascending").

*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?**
    *   Requires recall from a story. Similar to the Fundamental Rights in terms of recall, but from a narrative, not a factual list.
    *   Our question: Math concept, not recall from a story.

*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season." Talk about what you like to do, what you eat or wear, and w**
    *   This requires creative writing, sentence construction, and expressing personal ideas. The pass rate is low because it demands higher-order language skills, even for a simple topic.
    *   Our question: Much less demanding on English writing skills. It's a direct math task.

*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each.**
    *   This requires defining concepts and providing examples, demanding both recall and basic analytical skills. The language is more academic.
    *   Our question: Simpler task, less academic language.

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."**
    *   This is highly abstract, requiring interpretation, understanding literary concepts (theme), and expressing it in English. Very difficult for students with limited English and critical thinking skills.
    *   Our question: Concrete, mathematical.

**Challenging Assumptions:**

*   **"Ascending order" understanding:** While common in math, some students might confuse it with descending, or simply not know the term. However, the concept of "smallest to largest" is usually taught with numbers.
*   **Number comparison:** Students who struggle with place value (e.g., confusing 736 with 3367 because "33" is larger than "7") might make mistakes. However, comparing a 3-digit number to 4-digit numbers should be relatively straightforward for most. The fact that 736 is significantly smaller and only a 3-digit number makes it stand out.
*   **Rubric:** The rubric is very generous – only needing to identify 736 and put it first. This means even if they mess up the rest, they get 0.5 points if they start correctly. This dramatically increases the chances of partial credit.
*   **Anxiety/Blank Responses:** Some students will leave it blank. However, for a simple number task, the proportion of blank responses might be lower than for complex English tasks.

**Revisiting the average pass rate (29%):**
The average pass rate suggests that the overall difficulty of the exam is quite high for these students.

The task of arranging numbers in ascending order is a foundational math skill typically introduced quite early. The biggest hurdle will be the English term "ascending order" and the place value comparison for similar numbers. However, 736 is distinctly smaller as a 3-digit number.

Considering the lenient rubric (just identifying and placing the smallest number first), this task becomes significantly easier. Even if students don't know "ascending," they might pick out the smallest number instinctively. The question is a pure math skill, which is often less affected by English proficiency than analytical or writing tasks.

I initially thought it might be closer to 50%, but considering the strictness of the other examples and the general low pass rate, I
