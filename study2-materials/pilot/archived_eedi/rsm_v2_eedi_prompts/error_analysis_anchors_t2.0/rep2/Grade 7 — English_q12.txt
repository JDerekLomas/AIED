Errors students would likely make:

*   **Difficulty with verb conjugation for passive voice:** Many students struggle with irregular past participles (blown, not 'blew' or 'blowed'). Even if they understand the basic structure, getting the past participle right is a common hurdle.
*   **Incorrect auxiliary verb:** Students might use 'is' instead of 'was' if they focus too much on the present tense nature of "change" rather than the past tense of the original sentence. "The leaves are blown away by the wind" would be incorrect here.
*   **Omitting the agent ("by the wind"):** While often acceptable in conversational passive, in an exercise explicitly asking for a change, a complete transformation is usually expected for a full score. However, many might simply write "The leaves were blown away." Depending on rubric strictness, this *might* get partial credit but is often a common "near miss."
*   **Word order confusion:** The core restructuring of object becoming subject is a major leap for students who don't have a firm grasp of English sentence structure. They might attempt to keep "the wind" as the subject.
*   **Lack of understanding of "voice" concept:** Many students, especially at lower proficiency levels, might not even understand what "active" and "passive" voice means. They might try to rephrase the sentence in general terms without addressing the specific grammatical transformation.
*   **Translation issues:** If they translate to their native language and then back, they might lose the nuances of English passive voice.
*   **Not attempting at all:** Given the limited English proficiency, some students might look at "Active Voice to Passive Voice" and simply leave it blank, as they don't know the grammatical terms. This is particularly likely given the examples show a significant number of blank/minimal responses.

Most common wrong answers might look like:
*   "The leaves was blew by the wind." (Incorrect verb form)
*   "The leaves were blew away by the wind." (Incorrect verb form)
*   "The leaves is blown away by the wind." (Incorrect auxiliary verb)
*   "The leaves blown away by the wind." (Missing auxiliary verb)
*   "The leaves were blown away." (Missing 'by the wind')
*   "Wind blows the leaves away." (Rephrased in active, not passive)
*   Completely incorrect restructuring that keeps the wind as the subject or doesn't follow any logical passive construction.

Calibration analysis:
*   The 5% item requires understanding abstract concepts ("theme," "central idea") and applying them to literature, showing very low proficiency in higher-order tasks and abstract English terms.
*   The 15% item requires specific terminology recall ("archaeological," "literary sources") and differentiation. Students demonstrate some grasp of key terms but struggle with full explanation.
*   The 30% item (paragraph writing) allows for more creative, simpler English expression and gets a 30% pass rate. This suggests a notable portion can produce coherent but basic sentences.
*   The 50% item (recall specific information from text) is simpler than voice change as it doesn't require complex grammatical manipulation, just recall.
*   The 66% item (naming fundamental rights) requires factual recall of well-known civic information, which is a strength, not grammatical manipulation.

Changing active to passive voice requires specific grammatical knowledge that is often taught at an intermediate level. For students with limited English, the rules can be opaque. The irregular past participle of "blow" (blown) adds another layer of complexity. The term "Active Voice to Passive Voice" itself might be alien to many, causing a complete lack of attempt. However, it's a rule-based transformation, which can sometimes be grasped by rote. It's more complex than simple recall, but less abstract than interpreting a poem's theme.

Given the pass rates:
*   Simple factual recall (50%, 66%) is much higher.
*   Basic descriptive writing (30%) is a moderate hurdle.
*   Technical differentiation (15%) is tough.
*   Abstract interpretation (5%) is very tough.

This task is somewhere between "technical differentiation" and "basic descriptive writing" in terms of cognitive load for English grammar. It's a specific grammatical rule application. The 15% item involves specific academic vocabulary. This passive voice change, while involving specific grammar, doesn't require the same high-level vocabulary, but the rule itself is not always intuitively obvious. Students who have *memorized* the transformation rule (Subject-Verb-Object to Object-AuxVerb-PastParticiple-by-Subject) might do well, but many will struggle with applying it consistently, especially with irregular verbs.
