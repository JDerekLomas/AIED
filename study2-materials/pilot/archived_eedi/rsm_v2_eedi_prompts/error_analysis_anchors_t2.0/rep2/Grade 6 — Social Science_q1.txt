I'll break down the analysis for the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" to estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors and Student Performance:**

*   **Subject Knowledge (Geography/Social Science):**
    *   **Core Concept:** Mountain ranges in India are a fundamental topic usually covered in primary or early middle school social science/geography. The Himalayas are almost universally known. Other ranges like Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western/Eastern Ghats are also common.
    *   **Common Knowledge vs. Specific Recall:** While the concept of mountains is well understood, recalling two *specific major ranges* might be harder for some. However, "Himalayas" is almost certainly going to be one.
    *   **Misconceptions:**
        *   Confusing states/regions with mountain ranges (e.g., naming Punjab or Rajasthan).
        *   Confusing rivers with mountain ranges (e.g., Ganga, Yamuna). This is less likely for "mountain range" specifically, but possible.
        *   Listing individual mountains instead of ranges (e.g., Mount Everest – although Everest is in the Himalayas, the question asks for ranges, but it might be considered close enough if part of a list and the grader is lenient). The rubric explicitly asks for ranges, so "Mount Everest" alone wouldn't get a point. However, students *might* list Everest as their *second* choice if they already named Himalayas.

*   **Language Understanding (English):**
    *   **Key terms:** "Name," "two," "major mountain ranges," "located in India."
    *   **Clarity:** The question is very straightforward and uses simple, common vocabulary. "Mountain range" is a specific term, but visually represented often enough that most students would understand it.
    *   **Ambiguity:** None evident.

*   **Attempt Rate:**
    *   High attempt rate. This question is simple, direct, and doesn't require complex thought, only recall. Students will likely try to write something, even if it's incorrect.
    *   Minimal blank responses, especially if they know at least one.

*   **Most Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   Listing one correct range (e.g., "Himalayas") and one incorrect answer (e.g., "Ganga," "Delhi," "Deccan Plateau").
    *   Listing one correct range and nothing else (which still gets 0.5 points).
    *   Listing two correct ranges (e.g., "Himalayas, Aravalli").
    *   Potentially, less common ranges that are not considered "major" or are individual peaks.

*   **Rubric Impact:**
    *   The rubric awards 0.5 marks for *one* correct range. This significantly increases the pass rate, as getting *both* isn't required for partial credit. Many students will know "Himalayas."
    *   If the question required *two* for full credit, and nothing for one, the pass rate would be much lower. The partial credit is crucial here.

**Calibration Anchors Comparison:**

*   **"Write a theme of the poem 'The Last Bargain'." (5% pass rate):** This requires abstract thinking, literary interpretation, and articulate expression in English. Far more complex than naming a fact.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15% pass rate):** Requires understanding two distinct concepts, comparing them, and providing examples. More analytical and conceptual.
*   **"Write a short paragraph...on 'My favorite season'." (30% pass rate):** Requires basic paragraph writing, coherence, and drawing on personal experience. Many students struggle with expressing themselves beyond basic words/phrases (as seen in the "Winter Sweater Baju" example).
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate):** Requires specific recall of details from a story. This is a good comparator. Students need to remember three specific things. Here, we need to name *two* from a much wider range of possible correct answers. Knowing one of three specific story details might be comparable to knowing *one* of many possible mountain ranges.
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66% pass rate):** This is the *closest* anchor. It's also a recall question, asking for two specific items from a list (Fundamental Rights). Many students were able to recall at least two. The key difference here is that "Fundamental Rights" might be seen as slightly more complex or specific legal/civics terms than "mountain ranges." However, like mountain ranges, some are extremely common (Right to Equality, Right to Freedom).

**Considering the "Two Mountain Ranges" Question:**
