Errors students would make:

*   **Misconception about "some/any" usage:** The most common error would be selecting "any." Students often get confused between "some" and "any," especially when "any" is used in questions or negative sentences. They might not fully grasp that "some" is for affirmative statements and "any" is for negative statements and questions (unless offering something or expecting a "yes" answer).
*   **Lack of exposure to nuanced English grammar:** While the words themselves are simple, the specific grammatical rule for "some" in affirmative statements versus "any" in negative statements/questions is a finer point of English grammar that many learners, especially those with limited English exposure, struggle with.
*   **Guessing:** Given the binary choice, a significant portion might just guess. If they are truly unsure, they have a 50% chance of getting it right by random selection.
*   **Attempt vs. Failure:** Most students would likely attempt this question because it's a simple two-word choice and doesn't require extensive writing or recall. The failure would be in choosing the incorrect option.
*   **Common wrong answer:** The most common wrong answer would be "There are **any** apples in the basket."

Reasoning for pass rate:

*   **Simplicity of words:** "Some" and "any" are very common, basic words. Most students would recognize them.
*   **Binary choice:** Unlike open-ended questions, there are only two options. This significantly increases the chances of a correct answer, even for students who are unsure. A purely random guess gives 50%.
*   **Affirmative statement:** The sentence structure is straightforward and positive, which *should* ideally guide them towards "some."
*   **Comparison to anchors:**
    *   The 66% anchor ("Name any two Fundamental Rights...") involves recall but also has a high probability because there are many correct answers. Our question is simpler in structure but requires a specific grammatical choice.
    *   The 50% anchor ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?") requires recall of specific information from a text. Our question doesn't require text comprehension beyond the sentence itself.
    *   The 30% anchor ("My favorite season") requires original sentence generation, which is a much higher cognitive load than choosing between two words.

Given the simplicity of the task, the binary choice, and the high frequency of these words, even with limited English proficiency, a substantial number of students are likely to get this right. The primary hurdle is the specific grammar rule, which many would still be learning. However, many students, even if they can't explicitly state the rule, might choose "some" because it *sounds* more natural to them in that context from exposure.

Let's consider:
*   A pure guess would yield 50%.
*   Students with some exposure to basic English would likely have encountered "some apples" in context.
*   The confusion between "some" and "any" is real but perhaps not as universally problematic as differentiating historical sources or writing a multi-line paragraph.

I believe this question falls somewhere between the 50% (recall of 3 items) and 66% (recall of 2 common rights) anchors, likely closer to the higher end due to the binary choice and the intuitive feel of "some" in a positive sentence. Many might get this right without necessarily knowing *why*, just because it "sounds" correct.
