Here's an analysis of the "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning" question, followed by an estimated pass rate:

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

*   **Misconceptions about Social Science:**
    *   **Lack of Specific Knowledge:** The biggest hurdle will be students simply not knowing about the Harappan Civilization's urban planning features. While Harappan Civilization is typically covered in Class 8, the depth to which specific features of urban planning (like grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town) are emphasized can vary. Many students might have a general idea of "old cities" but not the *specific characteristics* that distinguish Harappan planning.
    *   **Confusing with Other Ancient Civilizations:** Some might vaguely remember features from other ancient civilizations if they haven't adequately differentiated Harappan. However, given the options provided in the rubric, the features are fairly distinct to Harappa.
    *   **Focusing on Non-Urban Aspects:** Students might remember other aspects of the civilization (e.g., their pottery, seals, farming) and write about those instead of urban planning.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Key Feature":** Students might understand "feature" but struggle with "key," leading them to list a trivial detail if they don't grasp the concept of distinguishing characteristics.
    *   **"Urban Planning":** This is a moderately complex term. While they learn about cities (nagar), "urban planning" might not be an explicitly defined concept they fully grasp. They might interpret it simply as "how the city looked."
    *   **Vocabulary:** Even if they know the concepts, articulating terms like "grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel," and "lower town" in English could be challenging.

*   **Attempt Rates:**
    *   I anticipate a high attempt rate. Even if students don't know the exact answer, "Harappan Civilization" is a recognizable topic from their syllabus. They will likely try to write *something* they remember about it, even if it's incorrect or off-topic. This aligns with the "My Favorite Season" example, where students provided even minimal, fragmented answers.

*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   "Harappans were good at building." (Too general)
    *   "They built houses." (Again, too general, doesn't capture "planning")
    *   "They made good pottery." (Off-topic)
    *   "They farmed a lot." (Off-topic)
    *   A generic answer about how people lived in cities, without specific architectural or planning details.
    *   Listing something correct but not *key* (e.g., "They had wells" might be true, but less defining than the drainage system or grid layout).

**Calibration with Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of Poem):** Requires interpretive skills and expressing an abstract idea. This question is more factual recall.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires knowing two distinct categories and providing an example for each. This requires more structured knowledge and recall of *two* things, plus differentiation. The Harappan question only asks for *one* key feature.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (My Favorite Season):** Open-ended paragraph, mostly personal experience, but requires structure and sentence formation. Students could provide very fragmented answers to get partial credit (as shown by "Winter\nSweater...").
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Direct recall of a specific plot point from a story. This is very close in type to the Harappan question – factual recall from history/literature. The king's questions are explicitly stated and usually taught. The prompt states "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do and the right people to work with" got a score of 1.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct recall of specific civic information. Similar to the king's questions, this is explicit knowledge students are expected to have. Two correct answers were required for 1 mark, making it a bit harder than the Harappan question (which only needs one).

**Reasoning for Estimated Pass Rate:**

The Harappan question is primarily factual recall. Students either know one of the listed features or they don't. Given that it only requires *one* key feature (easier than recalling three king's questions or differentiating two sources), and it's a foundational topic in Class 8 history, I would expect a significant portion to know at least one.

The difficulty is probably between the 30% "My favorite season" (which is mostly
