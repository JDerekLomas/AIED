**Analysis of Potential Errors and Student Understanding:**

Given the context of Class 8 students in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency and an average pass rate of 29% for the exam:

1.  **Historical Knowledge Gaps:**
    *   **Specificity of Battle:** While students might have heard of the Battle of Plassey, they might lack the specific details about *why* it was important beyond "British won." They might not grasp the concept of "political dominance" or "puppet ruler."
    *   **Cause and Effect:** Understanding *how* one event "contributed to" another requires analytical thinking, which can be challenging for this demographic, especially with complex historical concepts. They might state facts without linking them causally.
    *   **Key Terms:** Terms like "expansion of British power," "political dominance," "puppet nawab," and even "contribute" might be challenging.

2.  **Language Barriers:**
    *   **"Contribute to the expansion":** This phrasing is relatively advanced. Students might struggle to understand the nuances of this question. They might provide general facts about the battle rather than explaining its *contribution* to British power.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Words like "dominance," "establishment," and "nawab" (unless extensively taught in their regional language social science classes) could be difficult.
    *   **Answering concisely and accurately:** The rubric requires explaining a specific outcome (political dominance over Bengal via Mir Jafar). Formulating such a precise answer in English would be demanding.

3.  **Attempt vs. Failure:**
    *   **Attempt:** Most students will likely attempt this question as it's a prominent historical event. They might remember snippets of information.
    *   **Failure Modes:**
        *   **Vague answers:** "British won Plassey and became powerful." (Too general, not hitting "political dominance over Bengal" or "puppet ruler").
        *   **Incorrect details:** Confusing it with other battles or listing outcomes that are not direct contributions to *expansion* of power in 1757.
        *   **Recalling general facts:** Naming the participants or the year, but failing to link it to the specific impact on British power in India (beyond "they won").
        *   **Lack of Specificity:** Not mentioning Bengal or the puppet nawab.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer Look-Alikes:**
    *   "The British won the Battle of Plassey in 1757." (Factually correct but doesn't explain contribution to *expansion* of power with enough specificity.)
    *   "It helped the British to get more land/money." (Again, too general, lacks the political aspect and the Bengal context.)
    *   "Robert Clive won the battle and British became strong." (Identifies key figures and outcome, but not the *how* and *where* of power expansion.)
    *   "After Plassey, British became rulers." (Overly simplified and doesn't capture the initial establishment of political control via proxy.)

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract interpretation and articulate expression. This question is more factual, but the level of analytical reasoning and specific terminology might push it towards the lower end for an *accurate and rubrically compliant* answer.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate sources):** Requires comparing two distinct concepts with examples. Similar to our question, it demands understanding and recall, but the language might be simpler.
*   **Pass Rate 30% ("My favorite season"):** A descriptive writing task on a personal topic. Lower linguistic and content bar.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Pure recall of specific factual details from a story. This is a much lower cognitive load than explaining *contribution* and *expansion of power* with historical accuracy and specificity.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct recall of specific facts. Even lower cognitive load, requiring only two short, predefined phrases.

The Plassey question requires a combination of factual recall (the battle, the year) AND an understanding of its *consequences* for British power, specifically in Bengal, and often referencing the idea of a puppet ruler. This level of understanding and expression in English is significantly higher than recalling fundamental rights or even the king's three questions. It's more akin to the "differentiate sources" question in terms of requiring specific knowledge and comparison/explanation, but with potentially more complex historical terms and a less obvious answer for the students.

Many students will have a basic awareness but fail to articulate the crucial elements for a pass (political dominance/control over Bengal, puppet nawab). They will get partial aspects
