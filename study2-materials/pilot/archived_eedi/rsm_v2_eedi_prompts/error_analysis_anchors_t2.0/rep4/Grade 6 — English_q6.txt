Here's an analysis of the "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" question for Class 6 Indian government school students, leading to an estimated pass rate.

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

*   **Understanding "poem" and "line":**
    *   Many students might struggle to differentiate between a story and a poem, especially if they haven't been exposed to much poetry.
    *   Some might understand "poem" but struggle to correctly identify a "line" versus a stanza or a general idea. They might quote a phrase that isn't a direct line from the text.
*   **Understanding "like the most":** This concept is generally easy, but expressing *why* can be challenging.
*   **Understanding "why":** This is the crucial part.
    *   **Common issue 1: Simple identification without explanation.** A significant portion will simply copy a line from the poem and stop there, fulfilling only part of the rubric.
    *   **Common issue 2: Generic or superficial explanation.** Students might provide very basic reasons like "it's good," "it's nice," or "I like it," without deeper engagement.
    *   **Common issue 3: Misinterpreting "why."** Some might explain what the line *means* rather than why they *personally like* it.
    *   **Common issue 4: Language barrier for explanation.** Even if they understand the concept of "why," framing a coherent, grammatically acceptable sentence (or two) to explain their preference will be difficult for many with limited English. They might know *why* in their regional language but can't translate it effectively.
*   **Difficulty with the Poem Itself (if provided, which it usually is in this context):** The complexity and theme of the specific poem would significantly impact understanding and therefore their ability to choose a meaningful line and explain why. If the poem is abstract or uses figurative language, the "why" becomes much harder. *Assuming a relatively simple poem, similar to "The Last Bargain" in terms of accessibility.*
*   **Attempt vs. Failure:**
    *   Almost all students would *attempt* this question because it's relatively open-ended and requires minimal original thought initially (just copying a line).
    *   However, a large number would *fail* to meet both parts of the rubric (identify line + explain why) due to the language barrier and difficulty articulating a reason.
*   **Most Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   Just a copied line from the poem, with no explanation.
    *   A copied line from the poem, followed by a very short, ungrammatical, or superficial reason ("I like this because it is good").
    *   A student might misinterpret "line" and write a general summary or theme instead of a specific line.
    *   Completely unrelated answers if they don't understand "poem."

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** This requires deeper abstract understanding and articulation. Our question is less abstract in *what* to choose (just a line) but still requires a personal connection ("why"). The *articulation of the why* is where it overlaps in difficulty.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires conceptual knowledge and specific examples. This is much harder than our question's requirements.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Short paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This is perhaps the closest in structure. It requires personal expression and fulfilling specific criteria. Students can generally talk about simple things they like to do/eat/wear. The key difference is that for "favorite season," they have complete freedom. For our question, they *must* choose a line from a *given poem* and then explain. This constraint, combined with the nuances of poetic language, could make it slightly harder than just describing a season, but easier than differentiating sources. The short sentences in the 30% example ("Winter / Sweater") suggest even basic answers can score if they align.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This requires direct recall from a story. If the poem is short and clear, recalling a line might be easy, but explaining *why they like it* is harder than pure recall.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct recall of known facts, very high pass rate. Not comparable.

**Reasoning for Estimation:**

The most common partial credit or failure point will be the "why" component.
*   Many will simply quote a line, failing the "why" part (or giving an insufficient "why"). This would be similar to getting 0-0.5 points out
