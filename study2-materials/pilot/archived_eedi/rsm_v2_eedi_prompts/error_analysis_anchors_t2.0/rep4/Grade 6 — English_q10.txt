This question tests a very fundamental concept in English grammar: the use of 'some' vs. 'any'.

Let's break down the potential errors and analyze how students might approach this:

*   **Understanding 'some' and 'any'**:
    *   'Some' is typically used in affirmative sentences and offers/requests.
    *   'Any' is typically used in negative sentences and questions.
    *   The given sentence, "There are (some/any) apples in the basket," is an affirmative statement. Therefore, 'some' is the correct choice.

*   **Common Misconceptions/Errors**:
    *   **Direct Translation Issues**: Indian regional languages might not have an exact one-to-one equivalent distinction, leading to confusion when directly translating thoughts. However, 'some' and 'any' are quite distinct in their usage patterns which are often drilled in basic English lessons.
    *   **Lack of Formal Instruction/Reinforcement**: While it's a basic concept, inconsistent exposure to spoken or written English, or less-than-thorough teaching, might mean this rule isn't firmly grasped.
    *   **Guessing**: If students don't know the rule, it's a 50/50 guess between 'some' and 'any'.
    *   **Focus on 'apples'**: Some students might overthink if they should be quantifying the *quantity* of apples rather than the appropriate determiner for an affirmative statement. This is less likely to lead to an 'any' answer, however.
    *   **"Any" sounding natural**: In casual or less grammatically strict speech, sometimes 'any' might slip into an affirmative sentence ("Are there any apples? Yes, there are any apples there," which is incorrect, but could be a cognitive skip). This is usually corrected with more formal teaching.

*   **Likely Attempts/Failures**:
    *   This is a multiple-choice-like question. Students will almost certainly attempt it, even if just by guessing.
    *   It requires minimal writing, just circling or writing the word.

*   **Comparison to Calibration Anchors**:
    *   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.** This is factual recall, where the answer is binary (right or wrong). It doesn't test deep grammatical understanding. The slightly higher pass rate indicates it's accessible to many students.
    *   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is comprehension of a story, recalling specific details. It tests memory and reading comprehension, which is a bit more complex than choosing a word.
    *   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."** This requires extended writing, vocabulary, sentence construction, and idea generation – far more complex than the current question. The pass rate is low due to the holistic demands.
    *   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources...** This requires conceptual understanding, definition, and example generation, which is significantly more cognitively demanding than choosing a word.
    *   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."** This is advanced critical thinking, interpretation, and synthesis, demonstrating why its pass rate is very low.

*   **Analysis of the Current Question's Difficulty**:
    *   This question is a fundamental grammar rule often covered early in English language learning.
    *   It requires choosing between two words that *sound* somewhat similar in context, but have distinct grammatical rules.
    *   It's simpler than recalling factual information from a story (50% anchor) because it's a rule-based application, not memory recall of a specific text.
    *   It's much simpler than open-ended writing or conceptual differentiation.
    *   The binary choice makes a 50% guess possible. Students with even a minimal understanding of basic English structure (which is implied by a 29% average pass rate on *more complex* questions) should have encountered this rule.

Given that students managed 50% on recalling story details and 66% on basic factual recall, a question on a foundational grammar rule like 'some/any' should generally perform better than the 50% mark, especially because it's a fixed rule, not subjective interpretation. Many students from EWS backgrounds get some foundational English, even if basic. This specific distinction ('some' for affirmative, 'any' for negative/questions) is often emphasized early.

I would expect a good portion of students to know this basic rule, and for those who don't, 5
