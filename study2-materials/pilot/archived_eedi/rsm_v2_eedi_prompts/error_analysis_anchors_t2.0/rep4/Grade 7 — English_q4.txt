I'll analyze the question and student capabilities to estimate the pass rate.

**Question:** Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason.

**Rubric:** The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with. Any valid reason. Max score: 1

**Analysis of Likely Errors and Student Behavior:**

1.  **Understanding the King's Questions (Prerequisite):**
    *   The 50% pass rate item "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" shows that *half* the students can correctly recall the specific questions.
    *   This current question requires understanding *that* those questions exist and then applying them. A student who couldn't recall the questions might struggle here, or just give a generic answer.
    *   However, the question is phrased generally: "Do you think the king's questions are important...". Even if they can't *list* them, they might grasp the *spirit* of what a king would be asking about (decision-making, success).

2.  **"Important in Real Life?":**
    *   This part is straightforward for Class 7. "Important" is a common word, and connecting it to "real life" (i.e., outside of the story) should not be an issue.

3.  **"Give one reason":**
    *   This requires formulating a short, logical sentence or phrase.
    *   Students from economically weaker sections with limited English often struggle with generating coherent sentences, even if they grasp the concept.
    *   **Common successful responses might be very simple:** "Yes, because it helps to be successful," "Yes, to make good decisions," "Yes, everyone wants to know these things."
    *   **Potential failure points for reasons:**
        *   **Lack of Specificity:** Students might say "Yes, they are important" and stop there, not providing a reason. (e.g., like the "Empty Response" in other items).
        *   **Irrelevant Reason:** "Yes, because the king was smart." (doesn't connect to the "importance in real life").
        *   **Grammatical/Syntactical Errors leading to unintelligibility:** Like the "Viser to epumat" in the Fundamental Rights example, severe English issues could make a valid idea unscoreable. However, "happiness is find in innocence" (5% item) scored a 1, indicating leniency for grammar if the meaning is present. "Winter Sweater Baju Hot water Tea" scored 3, suggesting even fragmented ideas can sometimes be enough. This question is simpler in its demand.

4.  **Overall Difficulty relative to anchors:**
    *   The question itself is a "higher-order thinking" question in a way (apply knowledge, make a judgment) compared to just recall.
    *   However, the *response* required is minimal: a "yes/no" (implicitly yes, for almost all students) and *one* very simple reason.
    *   This is much less demanding than differentiating archaeological vs. literary sources (15%).
    *   It's simpler than writing a *paragraph* on "My favorite season" (30%), which required generating multiple sentences around themes.
    *   It's comparable in conceptual difficulty to recalling the *existence* of Fundamental Rights (66%), but requires slightly more independent thought.

**Connecting to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate):** This is a critical foundation. If 50% can state the questions, they have the core information. For this question, they don't *need* to list them, just implicitly acknowledge their general nature (about good decisions/timing/people).
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66% pass rate):** This suggests a good chunk of students can produce simple, correct factual responses. "Yes, because they help us make good decisions" is equally simple.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate):** This requires deeper textual analysis and abstract thought, much harder than providing a simple "real-life" reason.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15% pass rate):** This requires precise definitions and examples, again, much more complex than the current question.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... My favorite season." (30% pass rate):** This requires generating several lines of coherent text. This question requires only *one* simple reason, often just a phrase.
