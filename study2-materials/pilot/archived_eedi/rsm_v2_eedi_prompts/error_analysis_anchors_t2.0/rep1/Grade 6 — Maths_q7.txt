The student needs to perform two basic operations:

1.  **Calculate the time difference:** This involves understanding "am" and "pm" and counting hours.
2.  **Multiply and add:** Multiply the hourly temperature increase by the time difference, then add that to the initial temperature.

Let's break down the potential errors for Class 6 students in this demographic:

**1. Misconceptions about Mathematics:**

*   **Time calculation:** This is the most likely stumbling block.
    *   **Not understanding am/pm:** Students might struggle to convert 10 am to 4 pm. They might simply subtract 10 from 4, getting -6, or they might think it's 6 hours if they just count the numbers 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 without properly understanding that it passes through noon.
    *   **Counting on fingers incorrectly:** While they might attempt to count, errors in counting from 10 am to 4 pm (10 to 11 is 1 hour, 11 to 12 is 2 hours, 12 to 1 is 3 hours, 1 to 2 is 4 hours, 2 to 3 is 5 hours, 3 to 4 is 6 hours) are possible. A common mistake could be subtracting the numbers directly (e.g., 10-4=6, but if it were 4 pm, this calculation method would be flawed for "hours in a day" perspective) or getting 14 hours if they consider it a 24-hour cycle and interpret 4 pm as 16:00, and 16-10 = 6, which *is* correct for the *hours elapsed*, but this is a more sophisticated way. Most will likely count.
    *   **Simple arithmetic errors:** While 2x6 is basic multiplication, errors can occur. Similarly with 30+12.
*   **Order of operations:** Less likely to be an issue here as it's sequential.

**2. Language misunderstandings:**

*   **"am" and "pm":** Even with "in the morning" and "in the evening," the precise calculation between am and pm might be tricky if the underlying concepts aren't solid.
*   **"increases by":** Most students should understand "increases" as addition.
*   **"per hour":** Generally understood as multiplication for a rate.
*   **"what will be the temperature":** Clear enough.

**3. Attempt vs. Not attempt:**

*   This question involves numbers and a straightforward scenario. Most students would attempt it, even if their attempt is flawed. It's not abstract like a poem's theme.

**4. Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Time calculation error:** This will be the biggest source of wrong answers.
    *   Counting 10-12, then 1-4, and getting 5 hours (e.g., skipping 12-1 transition or other miscounts).
    *   Counting 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 as 7 hours.
    *   Subtracting 4 from 10, thinking 6 hours, without fully grasping the AM/PM difference. (This actually yields the correct number of hours *by chance* in this specific instance if you correctly adjust for the AM/PM boundary, e.g. (16-10=6) but not if it was say 2 am to 10 am where a simple subtraction 10-2 works too.)
    *   Getting 14 hours if they assume 4 pm means adding 4 hours to the count (10 am to 12 pm is 2 hours, 12 pm to 4 pm is 4 hours, total 6 hours, but if they add the numbers without thinking).
*   **Multiplication error:** (2 degrees * incorrect hours)
*   **Addition error:** (30 + incorrect total increase)
*   **Combining initial and final hours directly:** e.g., 30 + (4 - 10) or some other nonsensical combination.
*   **Just doing 30 + 2 = 32** (not considering time). This is a low-effort wrong answer.

**Analyzing Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (poem theme):** Highly interpretive, requires abstract thinking and good English expression. This question is far less demanding.
*   **Pass rate 15% (archaeological vs. literary):** Requires definitional knowledge and examples, likely memorization. Harder than this
