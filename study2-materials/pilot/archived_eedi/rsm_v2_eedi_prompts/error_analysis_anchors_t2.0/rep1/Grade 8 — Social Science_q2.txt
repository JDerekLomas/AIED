**Analysis of Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Limited Exposure to History Concepts:**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might have a superficial understanding of historical civilizations or recall isolated facts rather than interconnected features. "Harappan Civilization" might be a recognized name, but specific features of its urban planning might not be well-retained or deeply understood.
    *   **Impact:** They might attempt to recall something related to the Harappans (e.g., farming, seals, a river) but fail to connect it to urban planning.
    *   **Example Wrong Answer:** "Harappan people lived near a river" or "They used seals." (Incorrect, not related to urban planning). "They had houses" (Too generic, not a *key feature* of their *urban planning*).

2.  **Vocabulary and Language Barriers:**
    *   **Difficulty with "urban planning"**: The phrase itself might be challenging for students with limited English. They might understand "urban" (city) and "planning" individually but struggle to grasp the combined concept in an academic context, leading them to describe general city life rather than its planned structure.
    *   **Difficulty recalling specific English terms:** Even if they know about Harappan features in their local language, finding the precise English terms like "grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel," or "lower town" could be difficult.
    *   **Impact:** Students might provide vague answers or attempt to describe something using limited vocabulary, making it difficult to score.
    *   **Example Wrong Answer:** "They made roads good" (Attempts to describe grid layout but lacks specificity) or "Water was clean" (Tries to hint at drainage but is too general).

3.  **Rote Memorization vs. Understanding:**
    *   **Misconception:** Social science education sometimes emphasizes rote memorization of facts rather than conceptual understanding. Students might have memorized "Harappa had good drainage" but not genuinely understand *what* that means or *why* it's a "key feature of urban planning."
    *   **Impact:** If their memory fails on the exact phrasing, or if the question requires a slight rephrasing of a memorized fact, they might falter.
    *   **Example Wrong Answer:** "Drainage" (too short, needs a description to get the point).

4.  **No Attempt vs. Failed Attempt:**
    *   Based on the calibration anchors, there's a mix. For easier questions (50-66%), even "empty responses" exist, but also substantial attempts. For harder ones (5-15%), fragmented or partially correct answers are common.
    *   "Harappan Civilization" is a standard topic, so many will *attempt*. The pass rate depends on how many of these attempts meet the "one key feature" requirement, rather than being completely off-topic or too vague.

5.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   Likely to be attempts to describe something related to Harappan civilization but either too general (e.g., "they had big cities"), inaccurate, or failing to link directly to "urban planning."
    *   Vague descriptions of "drainage" or "roads" without sufficient detail to qualify as a *key feature* as per the rubric.
    *   Answers like "they lived near rivers" or "they grew cotton" will also be common, showing general knowledge but not specific to the question.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"Theme of The Last Bargain" (5%):** Requires interpretation and abstract thinking, which is very difficult. This question is much more factual recall.
*   **"Differentiate archaeological and literary sources" (15%):** Requires definitions and examples for two concepts. It's more complex than defining one feature. However, "Differentiate" can be a tricky command. Our question asks to "Describe one key feature" which is more direct recall. The pass rate here suggests difficulty in providing two distinct and correct examples/definitions.
*   **"Short paragraph on 'My favorite season'" (30%):** This requires paragraph writing skills and personal expression. Many students can talk about seasons, but structuring a 6-8 line paragraph meeting specific criteria ("what you like to do, eat/wear") is a higher bar for written expression. This question is less demanding in terms of language generation, needing only one descriptive sentence or two.
*   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%):** This is direct recall of a specific plot point. Students who have read the story likely know this. Many partial answers exist here (score 1 for mentioning even one). Our question is also direct recall, similar in a way.
*   **"Name any
