I will analyze the question, potential student errors, and then estimate the pass rate.

**Question Analysis:**

The question asks two main things:
1.  Will the gardener notice any change in the pit containing plant, vegetable, and fruit waste after some days? (Yes/No, implicitly expecting Yes)
2.  Give reasons for the change.
3.  Evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health.

The rubric specifically focuses on whether the *gardener notices significant changes*. This implies the initial observation of decomposition. The "give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial" part is a deeper level of understanding. Given the rubric max score of 0.5, it seems just correctly identifying "Yes, there will be change" due to decomposition/rot is enough for the partial score.

**Likely Errors and Considerations:**

*   **Science Misconceptions:**
    *   **Decomposition:** Many students might not explicitly know the term "decomposition" or the process of organic matter breaking down. However, they might have general observational knowledge of food scraps rotting or plants decaying.
    *   **Microorganisms:** They are unlikely to explicitly mention microorganisms as the cause, but a simple answer like "it will rot" or "it will become manure" is probably sufficient for partial credit.
    *   **Soil Health:** Understanding that decomposed matter is "good for soil" or "makes manure" is a common concept, even if the biological process isn't fully grasped.

*   **Language Misunderstandings (English is Limited):**
    *   **"Notice any change":** This phrasing is relatively straightforward.
    *   **"Give reasons":** Students might struggle with articulating the scientific reasons precisely in English. Simple terms like "rot," "decay," "break down" might be used.
    *   **"Evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health":** "Beneficial" and "soil health" are fairly common terms in an environmental context, but students might just state "yes, it is good."
    *   **Keywords:** Students are likely to latch onto "gardener," "waste," "plants, vegetables, fruits," "pit," "days," and "soil health."

*   **Student Approach (Attempt vs. No Attempt):**
    *   This is a question about an everyday observation. Students who have seen compost pits or observed food waste decaying are more likely to attempt it.
    *   Even with limited English, a simple "Yes, it will change. It will rot/become खाद (khad - manure)" might be attempted.
    *   Lack of specific scientific vocabulary might deter some from attempting to explain the *reasons*, but they might still answer "yes, there is change."

*   **Common Wrong Answers/Failures to Get Partial Credit:**
    *   **No change:** Unlikely for students who have observed anything.
    *   **Vague "change":** "Yes, it will change," without any hint of *what* kind of change (e.g., color, smell, becoming soil). However, "it will rot" or "it will turn into खाद/manure" would likely pass.
    *   **Focusing on other aspects:** E.g., mentioning pests or bad smell without connecting it to the decomposition process itself or soil benefits.
    *   **Completely unrelated answer.**
    *   **Empty Response:** If they don't understand the core concept or can't express it.

**Rubric Focus (Max score: 0.5): "The user suggests that the gardener will notice significant changes."**

This very low maximum score for just identifying "significant changes" simplifies the requirement greatly. Students don't need to explain decomposition or its benefits for full 0.5 marks, they just need to say *yes, change happens*. The implicit "significant" means it shouldn't just be "it got wet." It refers to the physical breakdown.

Given the calibration anchors:
*   Pass rate 5% for "theme or central idea of the poem": Requires abstract understanding and articulation.
*   Pass rate 15% for "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources": Requires definition, differentiation, and examples (conceptual understanding + factual recall).
*   Pass rate 30% for "Write a short paragraph... on My favorite season": Requires descriptive writing, imagination, and following prompts (personal expression + writing skill).
*   Pass rate 50% for "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?": Factual recall from a specific story, can be a simple listing.
*   Pass rate 66% for "Name any two Fundamental Rights": Factual recall, short answer.

Our question requires observation and very basic inference. "Does gardener notice any change?" is like the 50% factual recall questions in its
