Likely errors and their impact on pass rate:

1.  **Limited Knowledge of Rajasthan's Geography/Resources (Subject Matter Misconception):**
    *   **Impact:** This is probably the biggest barrier. Many Class 6 students, even within Rajasthan, might have a general understanding of "natural resources" but not specific enough knowledge to name two for Rajasthan. Students outside Rajasthan (or even within if geography hasn't been heavily emphasized yet) will struggle significantly.
    *   **Common Wrong Answers:** Generic natural resources (e.g., "trees," "animals," "rivers" without specifying, "soil," "water" – which is *correct* but might be difficult for them to connect to an *explanation* for Rajasthan specifically). They might list resources that are common in India but not specifically dominant/well-known for Rajasthan.
    *   **Attempt Rate:** High attempt rate, but many will be incorrect due to lack of specific knowledge.

2.  **Difficulty with "Explain How it Influences Lives" (Application/Analytical Skill):**
    *   **Impact:** Even if a student correctly identifies two resources, articulating the "how it influences" part can be challenging for this age group, especially if their language skills are weak. This requires a bit more critical thinking than just recall.
    *   **Common Wrong Answers:** Vague explanations, simple statements like "it's useful," "people use it," or failing to connect the resource to *people's lives* specifically. For example, if they say "water," they might just say "people drink it," which is true but doesn't quite "explain how it influences lives" in a broader sense for Rajasthan (e.g., desert agriculture, scarcity, reliance on specific water sources). They might state a resource (e.g., marble) but then only explain what it *is* rather than its influence.
    *   **Attempt Rate:** Many might attempt this part but only get partial credit or get it wrong due to insufficient detail or understanding of the prompt's nuance.

3.  **Language Barriers (English Comprehension/Expression):**
    *   **Impact:** The question itself is fairly straightforward ("Mention any two... explain how one..."). However, expressing the "explanation" clearly in English can be tough for students with limited proficiency.
    *   **Common Errors:** Grammatical mistakes, simple sentences, difficulty articulating complex ideas, use of local language terms, or just very brief, incomplete answers.
    *   **Attempt Rate:** They will attempt to write, but the quality of the explanation might suffer.

4.  **"Not Attempt at all" / Empty Response:**
    *   **Impact:** Due to a complete lack of knowledge about Rajasthan's specific resources or simply giving up if the first part is too hard. Based on the pass rates of other items (especially the 5% and 15% items, where the expectation for full completion is higher), a significant number of empty or very short, non-sensical responses are likely.

**Analysis using calibration anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of a poem.** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expression. Students struggled here, suggesting difficulties with nuanced explanations and language. Our question also requires explanation, but of a more factual nature.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate sources with examples.** Requires specific knowledge recall AND analytical comparison. This is similar in cognitive load to our question: "name two" (recall) and "explain how it influences" (analysis). The pass rate of 15% for "differentiate with example" is a strong indicator that students find these kinds of multi-part questions challenging. Our question *only* requires "one example explained," which is slightly easier than *two* differentiations *with* examples.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Paragraph on "My favorite season."** This is a personal, descriptive task. Many can relate to it, but structured paragraph writing is still hard. The 30% suggests basic descriptive writing for familiar topics is achievable for some.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer.** This is direct recall from a story, likely something they studied. Simple recall tasks generally have higher pass rates if the material was covered.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights.** Pure recall, relatively well-known topic. This confirms that simple recall of well-taught topics yields high pass rates.

**Connecting to our question:**

Our question requires:
1.  **Recall of specific information:** Two natural resources *of Rajasthan*. This is geographical knowledge and might not be as universally taught/recalled as "Fundamental Rights."
2.  **Basic explanation/analysis:** How one of them *influences
