Here's an analysis of the question and a pass rate estimation:

**Question:** Describes the poet’s writing style.
**Rubric:** Identifies a suitable and relevant word describing the writing style (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal, direct) or other appropriate word.
**Max score:** 1

Let's break down the potential challenges for Class 7 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections:

**Analysis of Potential Errors and Challenges:**

*   **Understanding "Writing Style":** This is a key conceptual hurdle. "Writing style" is an abstract concept. Students might understand individual words, but the idea of characterizing a *style* might be beyond their direct comprehension, especially if they haven't been explicitly taught literary analysis in this manner.
    *   **Misconception:** They might interpret "style" literally as handwriting, or might not understand it refers to the *way* something is written.
*   **Vocabulary for "Style":** Even if they grasp the concept, their vocabulary might be limited to describe a writing style. Words like "simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct" are relatively common, but stringing them together or knowing *which* word to apply accurately could be difficult.
    *   **Misconception:** They might pick a general positive word ("good," "nice") instead of a specific descriptor.
*   **Inferring from the Text (Implicit Information):** To answer this question, students need to have read the poem ("The Last Bargain," referenced in another item), understand its meaning, and then *infer* the poet's style from that understanding. This involves multiple steps of comprehension and higher-order thinking.
    *   **Misconception:** They might only be able to retell parts of the poem, rather than analyzing *how* it's written.
*   **Limited English Proficiency:** Even a single-word answer requires understanding the question, processing the poem, and then recalling an appropriate English word. The more nuanced the required vocabulary, the harder it becomes.
*   **Not Attempting/Empty Responses:** Questions requiring inferential thinking or abstract concepts often lead to a high percentage of non-attempts if students feel completely lost.
*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   Repeating parts of the poem's theme or plot ("He is finding a job").
    *   General praise unrelated to style ("The poem is good").
    *   Unsuitable or vague adjectives ("nice," "great").
    *   Describing the poet personally ("The poet is famous") rather than his writing.
    *   Completely irrelevant answers (if they didn't understand "style").

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (5% pass rate): "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"** This is also abstract and requires inference. The very low pass rate suggests students struggle significantly with abstract interpretation of poetry. "Writing style" is arguably even *more* abstract than "theme" as it describes the *method* of expression rather than the *content*.
*   **Item (15% pass rate): "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."** This requires understanding definitions and giving examples, a more factual recall/conceptual application. Students *attempt* this, but often struggle with accuracy.
*   **Item (30% pass rate): "Write a short paragraph... on 'My favorite season.'"** This is personal expression and creative writing, with clear prompts for what to include. It's much more accessible.
*   **Item (50% pass rate): "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This is factual recall directly from a story. If they read the story, they can likely find this.
*   **Item (66% pass rate): "Name any two Fundamental Rights..."** This is direct factual recall (memorization), a strength for many students.

**Conclusion:**

The question "Describes the poet’s writing style" is highly challenging due to:
1.  **Abstract concept:** "Writing style" is difficult for this demographic.
2.  **Inference requirement:** Students need to move beyond simple recall.
3.  **Vocabulary limitations:** Finding an appropriate single-word descriptor.
4.  **Connection to another unseen text:** (implied poem "The Last Bargain").

Given that "theme of a poem" gets only 5% pass rate, a question about *style* which is more abstract and requires specific literary vocabulary, is likely to perform similarly, if not worse, among this group. Students will either leave it blank or give irrelevant/too general answers.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 7%**
