The question requires changing an active voice sentence to a passive voice. This involves understanding the structure of both active and passive voices and correctly applying the rules, including verb conjugation and prepositional phrases.

Here's an analysis of likely errors:

**Common English Misconceptions/Language Misunderstandings:**

1.  **Lack of Understanding of Active/Passive Voice:** This is the primary hurdle. Many students, especially at this level and background, may not have a strong grasp of grammatical concepts like "voice" and the specific rules for transformation. They might recognize the words but not the grammatical function.
2.  **Incorrect Verb Conjugation:** The past participle "blown" is crucial. Students might use "blowed," "blowing," or simply repeat "blew." This is a very common error for irregular verbs.
3.  **Missing "were" or using incorrect auxiliary verb:** Students might write "The leaves blown away by the wind" (missing auxiliary "were") or "The leaves *are* blown away by the wind" (incorrect tense match, using present instead of past).
4.  **Incorrect Subject-Object Inversion:** They might invert the subject and object but not change the verb structure or auxiliary, leading to things like "The leaves the wind blew away."
5.  **Missing "by the wind":** While grammatically correct in some contexts to omit the agent, for a direct transformation exercise, its omission would likely be marked incorrect as it demonstrates incomplete understanding of the structure. However, it's possible some rubrics might accept "The leaves were blown away."
6.  **Direct Word-for-Word Substitution:** Students might try to find synonyms for words or rearrange them without understanding the grammatical transformation.
7.  **Simple Errors:** Spelling mistakes ("blone," "leavs"), or basic sentence structure issues.

**Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

*   Given the instruction "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice," students who have even a slight familiarity with these terms are likely to attempt it.
*   However, the complexity of correctly applying the rules means a high proportion of attempts will result in incorrect answers.
*   "Not attempted" would likely be due to complete unfamiliarity with the terms "active voice" and "passive voice."

**What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

*   "The leaves blew away by the wind." (Incorrect verb form, missing auxiliary)
*   "The leaves blow away by the wind." (Incorrect verb tense)
*   "The wind blew the leaves away by them." (Adding incorrect elements, retaining active structure)
*   "The leaves was blown away by the wind." (Subject-verb agreement error if they recognize the need for "was/were")
*   "Blown away the leaves by the wind." (Incorrect word order)

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%):** Requires analytical understanding of a poem and ability to express it concisely. This is very complex.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%):** Requires factual recall and comparative understanding of specific historical terms. Slightly less complex than analytical, but still requires domain-specific knowledge and definition skills.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%):** A short paragraph on "My favorite season." This is a common creative writing prompt. It requires some descriptive ability and sentence formation, but grammatical perfection is not the primary scorer here (as evidenced by "Winter Sweater Baju..." receiving a 3).
*   **Item (pass rate 50%):** Recalling specific details (three questions) from a story. This is primarily factual recall. Simpler, as the answer is directly from the text.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%):** Naming two Fundamental Rights. This is also factual recall, but likely a more broadly taught and frequently reinforced concept (Fundamental Rights) than specific story details.

This active-passive voice transformation question falls somewhere in the middle-low range of complexity for a government school student with limited English. It's not rote recall, nor is it complex analysis. It requires the application of a specific grammatical rule. The success depends heavily on whether this specific grammar point has been taught, understood, and practiced adequately. Given the average pass rate of 29% for the exam, and the difficulty of precise grammatical transformation with irregular verbs and auxiliary verbs, this is likely to be challenging. Many will attempt, but few will get all the parts correct.

It's more difficult than pure factual recall (50-66% items) because it requires transformation, not just recall. It's likely more difficult than writing a simple descriptive paragraph (30% item) because grammatical accuracy is paramount for a score of 1 here, whereas the paragraph allows for more leeway if ideas
