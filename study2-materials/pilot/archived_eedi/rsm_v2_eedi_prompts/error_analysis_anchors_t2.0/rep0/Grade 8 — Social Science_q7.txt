This question tests knowledge of a specific historical event and its consequences, requiring students to link cause and effect in a Social Science context. Given the context of Class 8 students in Indian government schools, primarily from economically weaker sections with limited English, several factors will influence the pass rate.

Here's an analysis of likely errors:

**Misconceptions about Social Science:**

*   **Lack of Causal Understanding:** Students might know *about* the Battle of Plassey but struggle to articulate its *contribution* to British power. They may list facts related to the battle without connecting them to the expansion of control.
*   **Focus on Surface Details:** Instead of explaining the long-term impact, students might focus on who fought whom, or simply state that the British won.
*   **Difficulty with "Contribution" / "Expansion of Power":** These are somewhat abstract terms. Students might not grasp the nuance of how a single battle led to broader political control, confusing it with military victory alone. They might see "power" as merely military might, rather than political and economic dominance.
*   **Memorization without Understanding:** Social Science curricula often emphasize rote learning of dates and events. Students might recall "1757" and "Plassey" but not the strategic significance.

**Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Contribute":** This word might be challenging for some students. They might interpret it broadly as "what happened after" rather than "how it helped achieve."
*   **"Expansion of British Power":** While "British power" is a common phrase, articulating *how* it expanded can be difficult if their vocabulary is limited for expressing abstract historical concepts (e.g., "political dominance," "puppet rule," "economic control").
*   **Syntactic Complexity:** The question structure, "How did X contribute to Y," requires a specific type of causal explanation which might be grammatically difficult for students with limited English proficiency.

**Attempt vs. Failure to Attempt:**

*   Students are likely to attempt this question if they recognize "Battle of Plassey" and "British." It's a key event in Indian history. However, many might fail to answer it correctly due to the reasons above.
*   There will be a spectrum of partial understanding – some might mention British victory, some might mention a ruler change, but fewer will explicitly link it to *political dominance/control*.

**Most Common Wrong Answer/Partial Answer:**

*   "The British won the Battle of Plassey." (No link to power expansion)
*   "Mir Jafar became the Nawab." (Correct fact, but often presented without explicitly stating his subservience to the British or the British political control it established).
*   "It helped the British to get money." (Partial, focusing only on economic gain without the broader political control implied by "expansion of power").
*   Confused answers about other battles or British figures.
*   Answers that list effects without clearly explaining *how* Plassey specifically contributed (e.g., "It gave the British power. They took over.").

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of Poem):** Highly abstract, requiring deep comprehension and analytical skills, as well as good English expression for nuanced ideas. This Plassey question is more factual, but requires analysis.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate Archaeological/Literary Sources):** Requires definitional understanding and examples for two distinct concepts. This is comparable to understanding "Plassey" and "its contribution" but less about differentiation and more about cause-effect. The Plassey question requires a specific chain of events or consequences.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Favorite Season paragraph):** Personal, open-ended, and allows for basic English expression without complex analytical or factual demands. Much easier.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Specific factual recall of a story detail. Relatively straightforward recall. This Plassey question requires more than just recall – it requires interpretation of impact.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Straightforward recall of common Civics knowledge. Highest recall, minimal analysis.

The Plassey question sits between the pure recall questions (50-66%) and the more analytical/abstract questions (5-15%). It's more complex than recalling facts from a story or listing rights, but less abstract than identifying a poem's theme. The key challenge is connecting "Plassey" to "political dominance/control" in Bengal, particularly through the figure of Mir Jafar. Students often remember the victory but not the strategic establishment of a puppet regime leading to de facto control.

Considering that the rubric explicitly states "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)", students need to
