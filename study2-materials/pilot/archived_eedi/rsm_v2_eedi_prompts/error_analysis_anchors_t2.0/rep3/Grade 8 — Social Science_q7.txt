Let's break down the likely student responses and estimate the pass rate for the question: "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"

**Analysis of Errors and Student Behavior:**

1.  **Misconceptions about Social Science/History:**
    *   **Lack of Causal Understanding:** Students might know *about* the Battle of Plassey but struggle to articulate its *consequences* for British power. They might recount events leading up to it or simply state that the British won, without connecting it to political dominance.
    *   **Focus on Military Victory Only:** Many might understand that the British won, but not grasp the *political and economic leverage* that victory gave them, particularly in Bengal.
    *   **Superficial Knowledge:** History is often taught as a series of facts and dates. Deeper analysis of cause and effect, especially concerning shifts in power, might be challenging. They might just know "British won" or "Mir Jafar became Nawab" but not the *implication* for British power.
    *   **Confusing with other battles/events:** Indian history is vast, and there are many battles involving various powers. Some might mix up the details or significance of Plassey with, say, Buxar or other conflicts.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Contribute to the expansion":** This phrase requires understanding causality. "Expansion" itself might be understood as geographical spread, but the deeper meaning of *power* expansion (political, economic control) might be missed.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Words like "dominance," "political control," "puppet nawab" might be advanced for students with limited English exposure, even if they grasp the concept. They might resort to simpler language that doesn't fully capture the rubric.
    *   **Formulating a Coherent Answer:** Even if they have some facts, structuring an answer that directly addresses the "how" can be tough.

3.  **Attempt vs. Failure:**
    *   **High Attempt Rate:** Most students would likely attempt this question as "Battle of Plassey" is a key historical event. However, the quality of attempts would vary significantly.
    *   **Failed Attempts:** Many would likely provide partial, superficial, or incorrect answers rather than leaving it blank.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answers/Partial Credit Issues:**
    *   "British won the Battle of Plassey." (Too basic, no explanation of *how* it contributed).
    *   "British became stronger after the Battle." (Vague, lacks specifics about political control).
    *   "Mir Jafar became the Nawab." (Correct fact, but often not explicitly linked to British control/puppet role).
    *   "British started ruling India." (Overly broad, conflates the immediate impact on Bengal with broader pan-India rule).
    *   Mentioning Siraj-ud-Daulah, Mir Qasim, or other related figures without explicitly linking to the question.
    *   Simply stating the date and participants.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, nuanced language, and deep comprehension. Plassey is factual history, making it somewhat less abstract than poetry analysis.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate sources):** Requires definitional clarity and examples, somewhat conceptual but less complex causality. Plassey is a single historical event, the question is more focused on its impact.
*   **Pass Rate 30% ("My favorite season"):** A descriptive paragraph, very open-ended, allows for personal expression, lower cognitive load in terms of factual recall or causal analysis. Plassey is a history question, requiring specific knowledge and analysis. This feels like the closest baseline for a *structured* factual answer.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (King's three questions):** Direct recall of specific plot points from a known story. If students know the story, it's straightforward. The Plassey question requires a slightly deeper analytical step ("how did it contribute?") beyond mere recall.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Fundamental Rights):** Direct recall of well-drilled facts from Civics. Simpler names to recall, less analytical.

**Estimating the Pass Rate:**

The question asks for a specific historical impact. Students will likely know *of* the Battle of Plassey. The challenge lies in connecting the victory to the "expansion of British power in India" in a way that aligns with the rubric (political dominance/control over Bengal, puppet Nawab).

Many students might offer factual tidbits (British won, Mir Jafar became Nawab) but struggle with the causal link required for the *explanation* (establishment of political dominance/puppet rule). The 3
