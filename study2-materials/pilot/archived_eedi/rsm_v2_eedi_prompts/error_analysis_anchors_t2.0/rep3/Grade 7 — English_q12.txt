I will analyze the potential errors students might make when attempting to convert "The wind blew the leaves away" from active to passive voice, considering the demographic (economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%) and the calibration anchors.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Fundamental Lack of Understanding of Active/Passive Voice:** Many students, especially those with limited English exposure, may not even comprehend the concept of active and passive voice. This is a grammatical transformation that requires a specific set of rules.
    *   **Consequence:** No attempt or a completely nonsensical attempt.

2.  **Verb Conjugation Issues (specifically "blow/blew/blown"):**
    *   The passive voice requires the past participle ("blown"). Students often struggle with irregular verbs. They might use "blowed" or just stick with "blew."
    *   **Common error:** "The leaves was blew away by the wind." or "The leaves were blew away by the wind." (Even if they get the auxiliary verb correct, the main verb will be wrong).

3.  **Auxiliary Verb Selection ("was" vs. "were"):**
    *   "Leaves" is plural, so "were" is required. Students might default to "was" (a very common mistake even in simple past tense usage with plural subjects).
    *   **Common error:** "The leaves was blown away by the wind."

4.  **Omitting "by the wind" or incorrectly placing it:**
    *   While often optional, the full transformation includes "by the agent." Students might omit it, leading to a partial credit if partial credit were given (but the rubric is strict: "correctly transforms"). They might also put it in the wrong place.
    *   **Common error:** "The leaves were blown away." (Technically correct passive, but might be considered incomplete by a strict marker aiming for the full transformation). However, the rubric implies a full transformation as the "correct" one.

5.  **Subject/Object Inversion, but keeping Active Voice structure:**
    *   Students might just swap the subject and object, but fail to change the verb form or auxiliary.
    *   **Common error:** "The leaves blew the wind away." (This shows a misunderstanding of the grammatical transformation itself, not just parts of it).

6.  **"Away" placement:** The adverb "away" needs to stay with "blown." Students might struggle to maintain this.
    *   **Common error:** "The leaves were blown by the wind away."

7.  **Simple English Comprehension:** The sentence itself is not overly complex ("The wind blew the leaves away"). Students will likely understand the meaning, but struggle with the *grammatical transformation*.

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** Requires interpretive skills, abstract thinking, and decent writing. Our question is purely grammatical.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological and literary sources.** Requires specific knowledge recall and ability to express it clearly with examples. Our question requires applying a rule.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "My favorite season."** This is a creative writing task requiring paragraph structure, descriptive language, and personal expression. Students with limited vocabulary might write very basic sentences (like the example provided: "Winter / Sweater / Baju"). This shows they can write *something*, even if poorly structured.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is a direct recall question from a specific text. Requires good reading comprehension and memory. If they remember, they can easily get it right.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Two Fundamental Rights.** Direct recall of specific civic knowledge. High pass rate suggests this knowledge is taught and tested often. Simple factual recall.

**Placement Reasoning:**

The passive voice transformation is a specific grammatical rule that requires understanding several sub-rules (subject/object swap, auxiliary verb usage, past participle form). It's more complex than simple recall (50-66% items) or very basic descriptive writing (30% item).

The complexity lies in:
*   Understanding the *concept* of voice.
*   Correctly identifying the new subject.
*   Choosing the correct auxiliary verb ('were' for plural past tense).
*   Knowing the irregular past participle of "blow" ("blown").
*   Correctly reintroducing the agent ("by the wind").

Many students at this level, given their limited English exposure and general academic performance (29% average), will likely struggle significantly with irregular verbs and auxiliary verb agreement, let alone the overall grammatical transformation.
