I will analyze the potential errors before providing the estimated proportion correct.

**Analysis of Potential Errors for "Identify the adjective phrase in the sentence: A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony."**

Given the student demographic (economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%):

*   **Misconceptions about "phrase" vs. "word":**
    *   Many students at this level struggle with distinguishing between a single word performing a grammatical function and a *phrase* (a group of related words without a subject and predicate).
    *   They might correctly identify "tiny" as describing the bird, but since "tiny" is just one word, they might believe it cannot be a "phrase." They might look for *multiple* words modifying "bird."
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** Some students might select "a tiny bird" (thinking it's the noun phrase containing the adjective) or even just "bird" if they misinterpret "adjective phrase" to mean "what the adjective describes." Others might try to combine "a" and "tiny."
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** Since the prompt specifically asks for an *adjective phrase*, and "tiny" is a single word, many students might think *there isn't one* in the sentence based on their understanding of "phrase." Or, they might look for something more complex like "in our balcony" (misidentifying it as an adjective phrase describing the nest, instead of an adverbial phrase of place).

*   **Understanding "Adjective":**
    *   Even identifying a simple adjective like "tiny" can be challenging. They might know "describing word," but formally identifying it might be difficult.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** They might struggle to pinpoint *which* word describes *what*.

*   **Understanding "Identify":**
    *   This usually means underlining, circling, or writing the word/phrase. The mechanical task is generally straightforward, but *what* they identify is the challenge.

*   **"Balcony" Confusion:**
    *   The word "balcony" might be less common for students from certain backgrounds, though it's fairly common in urban/semi-urban contexts. Even if they don't know the word, it's unlikely to significantly impact identifying "tiny."

*   **"Phrase" as a Barrier:**
    *   This is the *biggest* obstacle. The question specifically asks for an "adjective *phrase*."
    *   If students have been taught that a phrase consists of two or more words, and "tiny" is only one word, they might genuinely believe there is no adjective *phrase* in the sentence that fits their definition.
    *   This leads to either:
        *   Leaving it blank.
        *   Incorrectly identifying a multi-word sequence (e.g., "a tiny," "our balcony," "its nest").
        *   Mistakenly thinking "tiny" is not a "phrase" and thus getting it wrong, even if they know it's an adjective.

*   **Attempt Rate:**
    *   Given it's a fill-in-the-blank or selection, most students will attempt it. The issue will be the accuracy of the attempt.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **5% Pass Rate:** "Write a theme or central idea..." requires complex understanding, synthesis, and expressive writing, which is much harder.
*   **15% Pass Rate:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." requires specific subject knowledge and comparative analysis. This involves higher-order thinking and specialized vocabulary.
*   **30% Pass Rate:** "Write a short paragraph... on 'My favorite season'." This is creative writing on a common topic. The pass examples show very basic attempts are accepted. This item is easier because it doesn't test explicit grammar rules and allows for simpler language.
*   **50% Pass Rate:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" This requires recalling specific information from a text. If they've read the story, it's retrieval. Many might recall one or two but miss all three, or paraphrase imperfectly.
*   **66% Pass Rate:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights..." This is pure recall of specific terms. It's direct retrieval, often memorized.

**How this question compares:**

This question (adjective phrase) sits somewhere between the 15% and 30% markers, potentially closer to the 15-20% range.

*   It requires specific grammatical knowledge ("adjective," "phrase").
*   The trick is that "tiny" *is* technically an adjective phrase when it's the *head* of the phrase and stands alone. However, many students are taught a
