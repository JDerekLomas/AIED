Analysis of likely errors for 'My Favourite Hobby' paragraph:

1.  **Language Barriers (Grammar, Spelling, Sentence Structure):**
    *   **Common grammatical errors:** Incorrect verb tenses (e.g., "I played everyday" instead of "I play everyday"), subject-verb agreement issues (e.g., "my hobby are drawing"), lack of articles (a, an, the).
    *   **Poor sentence construction:** Fragmented sentences, run-on sentences, difficulty connecting ideas smoothly, leading to disjointed thoughts.
    *   **Spelling mistakes:** Common words mispelled, especially for less frequent vocabulary.
    *   **Difficulty with 'why':** Expressing abstract reasons for enjoyment can be harder than simply stating facts. They might just list what they do instead of explaining the feeling or benefit.

2.  **Lack of Cohesion/Paragraph Structure:**
    *   **Bullet points/Lists instead of sentences:** Similar to the 'My favorite season' example where a student listed single words ("Winter / Sweater / Baju"), students might list their hobby, when, and why, without forming complete sentences or linking them into a coherent paragraph.
    *   **Insufficient length/detail:** Even if they attempt sentences, they might struggle to produce 4-5 *meaningful* sentences, either repeating ideas or running out of things to say. They might write 2-3 sentences and then stop.
    *   **Not addressing all prompts:** They might mention the hobby and when they do it, but struggle to articulate "why I enjoy it" beyond very basic responses like "because it is fun."

3.  **Content and Understanding of "Hobby":**
    *   **Misunderstanding "hobby":** Some might list chores, daily activities, or school subjects instead of genuine leisure activities.
    *   **Difficulty choosing a specific hobby:** If they don't have a clear "hobby," they might invent one or struggle to elaborate on something they don't genuinely do.
    *   **Limited vocabulary for hobbies:** They might have a hobby but lack the English words to describe it or the actions involved.

4.  **Effort and Prior Experience with Paragraph Writing:**
    *   **Attempt but fail:** Many students will likely attempt to write, as the topic is accessible. The failure will stem from the cumulative effect of language issues, poor structure, and difficulty elaborating.
    *   **Copying phrases/memorized sentences:** Some might rely on rote-learned sentences or stock phrases, which may not fit the context well.
    *   **Low English proficiency leading to minimal response:** A significant portion, especially those at the lower end of the 29% average, might provide very short, incomplete, or grammatically garbled responses that fail the "complete paragraph" aspect of the rubric.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"My favorite season" (Pass rate 30%):** This is a very similar task. The 30% pass rate suggests that producing 6-8 *acceptable* lines is quite challenging. Our current question is 4-5 sentences, slightly shorter, which might make it marginally easier to *start* but still demands similar structural and linguistic competence. The "season" example shows attempts but also severe brevity and lack of coherence. "Winter / Sweater / Baju" scored 3 (presumably max, though only examples for max=3 shown) indicating some leniency, but even so, it implies the bar for 'short paragraph' can be very basic. However, our rubric for *this* question explicitly says "complete paragraph that clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable" for 1 mark, which might be a slightly higher bar for quality than implied by the 3-line response in the 30% anchor.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (Pass rate 50%):** This is recall, not production. Simpler for English, as the answer is direct. Not comparable in terms of writing demands.
*   **"Theme of 'The Last Bargain'" (Pass rate 5%):** Requires deeper literary analysis and abstract thought, combined with paragraph writing, making it much harder.

**Conclusion:**

The prompt is personally relevant and accessible in terms of content, which should encourage attempts. However, the requirement for a "complete paragraph" of "4-5 sentences" covering three specific points ("what, when, why") places a significant demand on grammatical accuracy, sentence construction, vocabulary, and paragraph coherence for students with limited English. The 'My favorite season' anchor (30%) is the closest comparable, and its examples show that even "pass" answers can be very basic.

Given the students' background and the 30% anchor, a slight increase might occur due
