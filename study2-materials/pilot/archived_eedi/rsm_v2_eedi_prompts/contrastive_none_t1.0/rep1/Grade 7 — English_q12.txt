Let's break down the question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Concept of Voice:** Students need to understand what active and passive voice are. This is a grammatical concept typically introduced in Class 6 or 7. However, the *depth* of understanding and ability to apply it can vary greatly.
    *   **Verb Tenses:** They need to identify the tense of the active verb ("blew" - simple past) to correctly form the passive verb ("were blown").
    *   **Parts of a Sentence:** Identifying subject, verb, and object is crucial to rearrange them.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are all common, basic vocabulary. No issue here.
    *   **Auxiliary Verbs:** Knowledge of "to be" verbs (was/were) for passive voice construction.
    *   **Past Participles:** Knowing the past participle of "blow" is "blown." This is a key hurdle for irregular verbs.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Grammatical Terminology:** "Active Voice," "Passive Voice," "sentence," "change the following" – these are direct instructions and might be challenging if they haven't been drilled in English grammar. If their grammar instruction is primarily in Hindi, they might not recognize these terms easily.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" is simple and direct. The vocabulary is accessible.
    *   **Conceptual Understanding:** The core difficulty lies in understanding the *grammatical transformation itself*, not the lexical meaning of the words.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application**. Students need to recall the rules for active-to-passive transformation and then apply them to a given sentence. It's not pure recall (like defining active voice) nor complex reasoning (like analyzing a literary passage).

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Sentence Complexity:** The given sentence is *very typical* of an introductory active-to-passive exercise. It has a simple subject-verb-object structure with a common irregular verb.
    *   **Irregular Verb:** "Blew" (past tense of blow) is an irregular verb, and its past participle "blown" is something students *must* know. Regular verbs (e.g., "The boy kicked the ball" -> "The ball was kicked by the boy") are generally easier because the past participle is just adding "-ed." Irregular verbs often pose a significant challenge because they need to be memorized. "Blow-blew-blown" is a common one, but not universally known by all students.
    *   **"Away":** The adverb "away" is part of the predicate and needs to be maintained. This isn't a major difficulty but adds a minor element.
    *   **"By the wind":** The agent ("by the wind") is optional in many passive constructions but is required by the rubric for a full score. Knowing when to include "by + agent" is part of the rule.

**Specific Challenges for the Target Group:**

1.  **Irregular Verb Forms:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Blow-blew-blown" needs to be known. Many students struggle with the full conjugation of irregular verbs.
2.  **Grammar Terminology in English:** If their primary grammar instruction is in Hindi, terms like "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" might be unfamiliar or poorly understood in English.
3.  **Lack of Practice/Exposure:** Given limited English proficiency and potentially less emphasis on complex English grammar in government schools compared to private schools, they might have limited practice with such transformations.
4.  **Conceptual Understanding of Voice:** Understanding *why* voice changes (focus on action vs. agent) can be hard for young learners, leading to rote memorization of rules which might not hold up under slight variations.

**Conclusion on Difficulty:**

This question is of **moderate difficulty** for Class 7 students in Indian government schools. The sentence itself is simple, but the grammatical concept requires specific knowledge of rules and, crucially, irregular verb forms. The irregular verb "blow" is a key discriminator. If it were a regular verb, the difficulty would drop significantly.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate of 29% for all items:** This question, while fundamental, is likely above the "easy" threshold for this group due to the irregular verb and the specific grammatical terminology.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%**

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

*   **Below Average Pass Rate:** I'm placing it below the average 29%. While
