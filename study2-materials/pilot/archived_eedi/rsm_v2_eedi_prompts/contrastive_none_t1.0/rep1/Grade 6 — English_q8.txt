Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Word Recognition:** Students need to recognize common English words like "book," "reading," "a," "is," and "he." These are very basic vocabulary items typically introduced in primary school.
    *   **Basic Sentence Structure (Implicit):** While they might not know grammatical terms like "subject," "verb," "object," they would have been exposed to simple English sentences and understand the concept that words combine to form meaning.
    *   **Present Continuous Tense (Implicit):** The words "is" and "reading" together imply the present continuous tense. This tense is usually introduced early in English language learning, often through examples of ongoing actions.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary is extremely simple and high-frequency. These are likely among the first English words a student learns.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax:** The core challenge lies in understanding basic English word order (Subject-Verb-Object). Unlike Hindi, which has a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure, English is SVO. This is a fundamental difference. However, "He is reading a book" is the archetypal simple English sentence structure often used in early language instruction to demonstrate SVO.
    *   **Task Understanding:** "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" is a common task type. While the instruction is in English, its simplicity and commonality might make it understandable, especially if demonstrated or if similar exercises have been done. The key is "meaningful sentence."

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** of basic grammatical rules (word order) to form a coherent sentence. It requires a low level of reasoning to understand the relationships between the words (who is doing what, what is being done). It's not pure recall, as the specific sentence isn't being recalled, but the *pattern* for forming such a sentence is.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is **on the easier side** for Class 6, even for students with limited English.
    *   **Typical exercises** might involve:
        *   Filling in blanks with appropriate words.
        *   Choosing the correct word from a multiple choice.
        *   Matching words to pictures.
        *   Perhaps slightly more complex sentence rearrangement with more words or less common vocabulary/structures.
    *   The words provided ("he," "is," "reading," "a," "book") form a very canonical, simple English sentence. There are not many plausible alternative arrangements that would make *any* sense, let alone a meaningful one. "Book is reading a he" clearly doesn't work. "Reading is he a book" also doesn't work. The SVO structure is quite salient here.

**Factors influencing difficulty positively:**

*   **Simplicity of Vocabulary:** All words are very common.
*   **Simplicity of Sentence Structure:** "He is reading a book" is a foundational SVO sentence.
*   **Lack of Ambiguity:** There's only one truly meaningful and grammatically correct arrangement.

**Factors influencing difficulty negatively:**

*   **Hindi-medium background:** SVO vs. SOV difference. However, by Class 6, basic English SVO structures should have been introduced repeatedly.
*   **Limited English proficiency:** Could struggle with even simple word order if exposure has been extremely minimal.
*   **Understanding the instruction:** "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" requires comprehension of the task.

**Conclusion:**

Given the extreme simplicity of the vocabulary and the standard SVO structure, this question targets a very basic level of English grammar application. While the SVO structure is different from Hindi, it's one of the first grammatical concepts taught in English language learning. By Class 6, students, even those struggling, would have encountered and practiced such simple sentences. The average pass rate of 29% for the *overall exam* is a critical benchmark, suggesting many items are indeed difficult. However, this specific item feels significantly easier than what would typically yield such a low average. It's a foundational skill.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60-70%**

My reasoning for this range:
*   **Not 100%:** Because of the actual challenges of limited English proficiency, the SVO vs. SOV difference, and potential issues understanding the instructions even if the sentence itself is simple. Some students might simply guess or get confused.
*   **Significantly higher than 29% average:** This question tests a very
