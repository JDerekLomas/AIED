Let's break down the question and its demands on a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Question:** Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there.

**Rubric (for max score 1):** Mentions two correct natural resources (e.g., water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy).

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographical Awareness:** Students need to know what Rajasthan is and its general location/characteristics (desert state). This is typically covered in Class 6 geography, often with maps.
    *   **Concept of "Natural Resources":** They need to understand what a natural resource is. This is a fundamental concept introduced early in environmental studies/geography.
    *   **Specific Resources of Rajasthan:** This is the most crucial knowledge gap. While common resources like "water" are universal, specific mineral resources like "marble," "copper," "zinc," "gypsum," or even "salt" (from Sambhar Lake) require specific knowledge about Rajasthan's geography and economy. Even "sunlight" and "wind" as energy resources require a slightly more abstract understanding.
    *   **Influence of Resources:** They need to connect a resource to its impact on people's lives (e.g., water for farming, mining for jobs, marble for building, salt for food/industry). This requires basic reasoning about cause and effect.

*   **Language Demands (English):**
    *   "Mention": Straightforward instruction.
    *   "Natural resources": Key terminology, likely learned in English, but the Hindi equivalent ("प्राकृतिक संसाधन") would be more familiar.
    *   "Found in Rajasthan": Clear.
    *   "Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":
        *   "Explain": Requires descriptive ability beyond just naming.
        *   "Influences": This word might be challenging. A student might understand "impacts" or "effects" more readily, but "influences" is a common academic term.
        *   "Lives of the people": Clear.
        *   "There": Refers to Rajasthan.
    *   **Overall:** The vocabulary is not overly complex for a Class 6 student who has some exposure to English, but "influences" might be a slight hurdle. The grammatical structure is straightforward. However, for "limited English proficiency," even common terms can be an issue.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Naming two natural resources of Rajasthan is primarily recall-based.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** Explaining *how* one resource influences lives involves applying knowledge and basic reasoning (e.g., water in a desert state is used for drinking and farming). It's not complex critical thinking, but rather connecting cause and effect.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Naming Resources:** Naming resources of a state is a very common type of question in Indian geography textbooks (e.g., "List the major minerals found in your state," or "What are the main agricultural products of Rajasthan?"). So, the recall part is standard.
    *   **Explaining Influence:** The "explain how it influences lives" part is also common, but might be slightly more open-ended than a direct recall question. Textbooks often have sections discussing the economic activities or lifestyle of people in different regions based on available resources.
    *   **Difficulty:** It's slightly above a purely factual recall question due to the explanation component, but it's not a higher-order thinking question that requires deep analysis or synthesis. It's well within the expected cognitive domain for a Class 6 Social Science exam.

**Crucial Considerations for "Average pass rate ~29%":**

The rubric for a "max score of 1" is *only* "Mentions two correct natural resources." This significantly simplifies the task for getting *any* score on this question. The explanation part, which is linguistically and cognitively more demanding, is *not* required for the single point. This is a critical observation.

So, the question effectively boils down to: "Name any two natural resources found in Rajasthan."

Given this, let's re-evaluate:

*   **Knowledge:** Most Class 6 students would have learned about Rajasthan as a desert state. "Water" would be an obvious choice for a resource (even if scarce, its importance is paramount). What's the second? "Sand" is a natural resource, abundant in Rajasthan. "Sunlight" for
