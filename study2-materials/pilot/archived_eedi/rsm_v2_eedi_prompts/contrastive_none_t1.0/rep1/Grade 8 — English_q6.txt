Let's break down the question "Define fable" for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students should have encountered fables (e.g., Aesop's Fables are common, even if in translated versions like *Panchatantra* stories). The *concept* of a story with animal characters and a moral is likely familiar.
    *   **Potential Gaps:** While the *concept* is known, the *term* "fable" itself might not be universally taught or reinforced in English in all Hindi-medium schools, especially if the stories are primarily discussed using Hindi terms for "moral stories" or "animal stories." They might know the stories but not the specific English literary term.

*   **Language Demands (on students with limited English):**
    *   **"Define":** This is a common and relatively straightforward instruction, usually understood as "give the meaning of." It's not overly complex.
    *   **"Fable":** This is the core vocabulary challenge.
        *   It's a single, relatively short word.
        *   It's an academic/literary term.
        *   Students might struggle to articulate the definition in coherent English, even if they grasp the concept. They might resort to very simple, broken English or just give examples instead of a definition.
        *   The *rubric's* required components ("short story," "animals as characters," "imparts a moral lesson") involve several distinct ideas, each requiring specific English vocabulary. "Imparts a moral lesson" is particularly high-level English for this demographic. They might say "gives good teaching" or "teaches right thing."

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Primarily recall of a definition. There's no application or complex reasoning involved beyond remembering and articulating the meaning.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **In English textbooks:** This would be a fairly standard, low-to-medium difficulty question for a chapter on literary terms or story types. Students might be asked to "Define X" or "What is X?"
    *   **In general (considering limited English):** The difficulty comes from the *specific vocabulary* ("fable" itself, and the vocabulary needed to construct the definition) rather than the complexity of the task. For students who learn literary concepts predominantly in Hindi, translating and then articulating the definition in English is a significant hurdle. Many textbook exercises might focus on simpler vocabulary or direct comprehension rather than formal definitions of literary terms.

**Summary of Difficulty:**
The concept is likely familiar. The instruction "Define" is clear. The primary difficulty stems from:
1.  Whether the English term "fable" is known as the equivalent of the Hindi term/concept they know.
2.  The ability to articulate the multi-part definition in grammatically acceptable English, especially phrases like "imparts a moral lesson." Students might get one or two parts but miss the full nuance required by the rubric.

Given an average pass rate of 29% for the exam, this question is likely to be harder than average because it requires both specific English vocabulary knowledge (the term "fable") AND the ability to construct a multi-part definition in English, which is a higher-order language skill than simple recall of facts. Many students might offer a partial definition or an example instead of a formal definition.

If 10-15% can articulate *most* of the definition in reasonable English, that would be a good outcome. Another 5-10% might get partial credit (e.g., mention animals and moral, but not "short story" or "imparts"). However, the rubric demands all three elements for max score.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** 15%
