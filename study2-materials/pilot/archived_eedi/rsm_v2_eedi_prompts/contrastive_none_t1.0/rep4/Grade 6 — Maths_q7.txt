Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school.

**Analysis of the Question:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Time Calculation:** Ability to calculate the difference between two times, especially across AM/PM. This involves understanding a 12-hour clock and potentially converting to a 24-hour format mentally or explicitly. This is a crucial and potentially challenging step.
    *   **Multiplication:** Basic multiplication (6 hours * 2 degrees/hour). This should be well within Class 6 curriculum.
    *   **Addition:** Basic addition (initial temperature + total increase). Also well within Class 6.
    *   **Units:** Understanding of degrees Celsius and hours.
    *   **Concept of Rate:** Understanding "per hour" means multiplication. This is fundamental for this problem.

*   **Language Demands:** This is where the primary difficulty lies for students with limited English proficiency.
    *   "At 10 am in the morning": Fairly straightforward.
    *   "temperature... was 30°C": Understandable.
    *   "increases by 2°C per hour": "Increases by" and "per hour" are key phrases. "Per hour" might be the most challenging aspect if the concept isn't firmly grasped in their native language and then translated.
    *   "then what will be the temperature... at 4:00 in the evening?": "What will be" (future tense) and "in the evening" are standard time descriptors.
    *   **Overall:** The vocabulary isn't overly complex, but understanding the *relationships* expressed by "increases by" and "per hour" is critical. If "per hour" is confused with simple addition (e.g., adding 2 to 30 and then adding something else), the calculation will be wrong.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Application:** This is a classic application problem. Students need to apply their knowledge of time, multiplication, and addition to a real-world scenario.
    *   **Reasoning:** There's a mild element of reasoning required to correctly identify the steps: 1) find total time, 2) find total temperature increase, 3) find final temperature. The hardest reasoning step is calculating the elapsed time correctly.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises (Class 6 Indian Curriculum):**
    *   **Time:** Calculating time differences (e.g., "how long did the train journey last?") are common, but often presented more directly or within a single AM/PM context. Crossing AM to PM and accurately counting hours can be tricky for some.
    *   **Rates:** Simple rate problems (e.g., "If one pen costs X, what do 5 pens cost?") are common. "Per hour" for temperature change is a good application of this concept.
    *   **Word Problems:** This is a multi-step word problem, which is standard for Class 6. The difficulty often hinges on the complexity of the language and the number of steps.
    *   **Difficulty:** This question is likely slightly above the easiest textbook exercises but well within the range of moderately difficult ones. The main hurdle is the combination of time calculation and rate application, compounded by the language barrier.

**Breakdown of Potential Errors:**

1.  **Time Calculation (Most Likely Error):**
    *   Counting 10 am, 11 am, 12 pm, 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm gives 7 hours if the starting point (10 am) is included as an hour *interval*. The correct calculation is from 10 am *to* 4 pm, which is 6 hours (10-11, 11-12, 12-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4). This is a very common mistake.
    *   Confusion with 12-hour clock (e.g., 12 pm to 1 pm is 1 hour, not 13-10).
    *   Simple arithmetic errors in counting.
2.  **Misunderstanding "per hour":**
    *   Adding 2 only once (30 + 2 = 32).
    *   Multiplying by 2 directly without finding the hours first (30 * 2 = 60).
    *   Ignoring the "increase" and just stating 2°C.
3.  **Language Barrier:** The phrase "increases by 2°C per hour" could be misconstrued, leading to incorrect operations.

**Estimation Justification:**

*   **Average Pass Rate (29
