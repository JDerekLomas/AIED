Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Basic geographical knowledge of India:** Students are expected to know that Rajasthan is a state in India. This is likely covered in Class 5 or 6 Social Science.
    *   **Concept of "natural resources":** They should understand what a natural resource is (things found in nature that humans use). This is a core concept in early geography/environmental studies.
    *   **Examples of natural resources:** They need to be able to recall specific examples.
    *   **Link between resources and human life:** The second part requires understanding that natural resources impact how people live. This is usually explored through examples (e.g., fertile land for farming, water for drinking/irrigation).
    *   **Specific knowledge of Rajasthan's resources:** This is the most crucial assumed knowledge. Students would ideally have studied regional geography, including prominent resources of various states. Textbooks often list these.

2.  **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **"Mention any two natural resources":** "Mention" is a common verb. "Natural resources" is a key term, likely introduced and reinforced in Hindi (प्राकृतिक संसाधन) alongside English. "Any two" is straightforward.
    *   **"found in Rajasthan":** Simple geographical locator.
    *   **"explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":** This is where the language becomes slightly more demanding.
        *   "Explain" (समझाना/वर्णन करना) is a common instruction.
        *   "Influences" (प्रभावित करना) is a slightly more abstract concept. While they might understand the idea, articulating it in English could be challenging.
        *   "Lives of the people there" refers to the residents of Rajasthan.
    *   **Overall:** The sentence structure is relatively simple. The main challenge will be expressing the *explanation* clearly in English, even if they understand the concept in Hindi. They might resort to very basic, short sentences.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Part 1 ("Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan"):** Primarily **recall**. They need to remember specific resources associated with Rajasthan from their lessons.
    *   **Part 2 ("explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there"):** This leans towards **application/simple reasoning**. They need to apply their understanding of a resource's utility to the lives of people in that specific region. It's not complex reasoning, but requires connecting a cause (resource) to an effect (influence on life).

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   This question format (listing and then explaining) is very common in Social Science textbooks and exams.
    *   The content (natural resources, regional geography) is central to Class 6 EVS/Social Science.
    *   The difficulty lies in:
        *   **Specific recall for Rajasthan:** If their textbook focused broadly on India's resources rather than state-specific ones in detail, this could be hard. However, Rajasthan is quite distinct geographically, so its resources (desert, minerals, specific crops like bajra due to less water) are often highlighted.
        *   **Formulating the explanation in English:** Even simple explanations like "Water is used for drinking and irrigation, allowing farming" can be a hurdle for limited English speakers. Many might get the idea but struggle to put it into coherent English sentences.
        *   **Lack of partial credit for the explanation part:** The rubric gives a maximum of 1 point just for mentioning two resources. This is *crucial*. The question asks for an explanation, but the rubric doesn't award points for it. This makes the question *easier* to score 1 point on than it appears at first glance, *if* the students realize this or if evaluators are lenient. However, the prompt asks for an estimate based on answering the question "correctly," which usually implies fulfilling all parts of the question as stated. If we assume "correctly" means fully answering both parts, then it's harder. If "correctly" means scoring the maximum rubric point, then it's easier. Given the average pass rate, I'll assume they need to fulfill the *spirit* of the question to be considered "correct" by a student's self-assessment, even if the rubric is minimal.

**Specific Points for Rajasthan:**
*   **Easy to recall:** Sand (desert), Marble (famous for construction), Water (often scarcity is highlighted, but rivers like Chambal, groundwater are resources), Gy
