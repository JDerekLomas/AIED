Let's break down the question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." using the provided framework.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** The most crucial prior knowledge is understanding the context of "the king's questions" from the reading passage. The rubric explicitly states what these questions were: "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with." Students *must* have grasped these core ideas from the preceding text. If they didn't understand the passage itself, this question becomes impossible.
    *   **Basic Understanding of "Important" and "Real Life":** This is generally accessible at Class 7 level, even with limited English.
    *   **Ability to Articulate a Reason:** Students need to be able to connect the king's questions to a personal observation or general truth.

*   **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Important," "real life," "reason" are relatively common words. "Think" is also basic. The language used in the question itself is quite simple and direct.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** "Do you think X is Y? Give one Z." This is a straightforward question structure.
    *   **Cognitive Load from Passage:** The main language burden will come from comprehending the *source passage* about the king's questions. If the passage itself was complex or contained many unfamiliar words, it would significantly impact their ability to answer this follow-up question. Assuming the passage was also simplified, the direct question here is manageable.
    *   **Expressing a Reason:** This is where some students might struggle. While the concept of "reason" is clear, formulating a coherent English sentence to explain *why* can be challenging for those with limited expressive English skills, even if they understand the underlying concept in Hindi. They might grasp the idea but struggle to put it into words.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** It's not pure recall. Students must *apply* their understanding of the king's questions to their own "real life" context and *reason* why these questions have significance beyond the story. They have to form an opinion and justify it.
    *   The rubric states "Any valid reason," indicating a degree of flexibility and encouraging personal connection rather than a single 'correct' answer. This makes it less about finding the exact word from the text and more about understanding the concept.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **More Challenging than Recall, Less than Complex Inference:** Typical textbook exercises often involve direct factual recall from a passage or simple comprehension checks (e.g., "Who was the king?"). This question goes a step further by requiring an opinion and justification.
    *   **Similar to "Value-Based Questions":** In some Indian curricula, "value-based questions" are introduced around this age, which require students to reflect on moral or practical lessons from a text. This question falls into that category.
    *   **Easier if the passage was understood well:** If the passage was effectively conveyed (perhaps with some teacher scaffolding or very simplified language), the core "importance" of the king's questions is quite intuitive. Most people would agree that knowing the right time, action, and people is universally beneficial. The difficulty lies in articulating *why*.

**Overall Assessment:**

The question itself is framed in relatively simple English. The core challenge comes from:
1.  **Prior Comprehension of the Passage:** Without understanding *what* the king's questions were, they can't answer. Assuming the passage was appropriately leveled, this hurdle is surmountable.
2.  **Formulating a Reason in English:** Even if a student understands the importance in their mind (in Hindi), expressing a clear, valid reason in English can be a significant barrier for those with limited proficiency. They might give a very short, fragmented answer or struggle to articulate the connection. The simplicity of a "valid reason" (e.g., "to make good decisions," "to avoid mistakes," "to be successful") helps, but producing even these simple phrases can be tough.

Given that the average pass rate is 29% for *all* items, and this question requires a blend of comprehension, opinion, and basic articulation in English, it's likely to be slightly harder than a pure recall question but not excessively difficult if the passage was understood. The "give one reason" part elevates it slightly.

Let's consider the breakdown:
*   A good portion might understand the passage and the general importance.
*   A significant number might struggle to articulate a
