Let's break down the question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, keeping their specific context in mind.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Grammatical Concepts:** The question explicitly tests knowledge of "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice." This is a standard grammar topic typically introduced around Class 6 or 7 in English curricula. Students are expected to understand the difference in subject-object relationship and verb forms.
    *   **Verb Tenses:** The sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" is in simple past tense. Students need to know how to form the past participle ("blown") and the appropriate auxiliary verb ("were") for the passive voice in past tense.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are all very common, basic words. No complex vocabulary is involved.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Instructional Language:** The instruction "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" uses specific grammatical terminology. While these terms are taught in English classes, students from Hindi-medium schools might struggle to *immediately* grasp the instruction if their primary mode of instruction for grammar has been in Hindi, or if they lack consistent exposure to English grammatical metalanguage. They might know the *concept* but not recognize the English *label* instantly.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The original sentence is simple, SVO (Subject-Verb-Object). This is easy to understand.
    *   **Passive Voice Transformation:** The transformation itself requires understanding how to identify the object, make it the new subject, use the correct form of "to be" (were), the past participle (blown), and potentially "by + original subject." This is the core challenge.
    *   **Idiomatic Expressions/Phrasal Verbs:** "Blew away" is a phrasal verb. While "blew" is past tense of "blow," and "away" means distance, understanding "blew away" as a unit (indicating dispersal) is important. However, it's a relatively transparent phrasal verb.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application**. Students need to recall the rules for active-to-passive transformation and then apply them to the given sentence. It's not pure recall (like defining active voice) nor complex reasoning (like analyzing a literary passage).

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Sentence Complexity:** The sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" is a very typical, straightforward sentence used in textbook exercises for active-passive voice transformation. It's short, uses common words, and a simple past tense, which is usually among the first tenses taught for this transformation.
    *   **Verb Irregularity:** "Blew" (past tense of "blow") is an irregular verb, and "blown" is its past participle. Students are typically drilled on common irregular verbs in Class 6/7. This adds a slight layer of complexity compared to a regular verb like "washed" (wash-washed-washed). However, "blow" is very common.
    *   **Phrasal Verb:** The "away" might slightly complicate it compared to a simple transitive verb without a particle, but again, it's a common structure.

**Overall Assessment:**

*   **Positive Factors:** Basic vocabulary, simple sentence structure, common grammatical topic for the age group. The concept of active/passive voice is fundamental.
*   **Negative Factors:** Reliance on specific English grammatical terminology in the instruction. The need to correctly form the past participle of an irregular verb ("blown") and choose the correct auxiliary verb ("were" for past tense plural subject). The average pass rate of 29% suggests significant struggles with English content overall.

Given the average pass rate of 29%, this question is likely *slightly above average* in difficulty for these students, but still very much within the range of what's taught. The key hurdle will be the combination of:
1.  Understanding the instruction "Active Voice to Passive Voice" in English.
2.  Accurately recalling and applying the transformation rules, especially the correct auxiliary verb ("were") and past participle ("blown").

Many students might struggle with either the auxiliary verb (e.g., using "was" or "are") or the past participle form (e.g., "blewed" or "blowed"). Some might omit "by the wind" which, while common in spoken English, is usually expected in a full grammatical transformation exercise.

Considering the "average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%," and this question isn't exceptionally easy nor exceptionally hard compared to a typical grammar item:
