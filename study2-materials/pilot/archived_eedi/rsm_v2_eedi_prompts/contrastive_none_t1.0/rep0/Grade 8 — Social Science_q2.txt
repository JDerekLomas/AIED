Let's break down the question's difficulty for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students should have covered the Harappan Civilization (also known as Indus Valley Civilization) in their Class 6 or 7 History textbooks (e.g., NCERT textbooks). This topic is fundamental for ancient Indian history. Specifically, urban planning is a very prominent feature discussed, often highlighted with diagrams and descriptions.
    *   **Potential Gaps:** While taught, the *depth* of understanding or recall might vary. Some students might remember the name but struggle with specific features beyond "old civilization." The term "urban planning" itself might be slightly formal for some, but the underlying concepts (city layout, drainage) are usually simplified and explained.

*   **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **Keywords:** "Describe," "key feature," "Harappan Civilization," "urban planning."
    *   **"Describe":** A common command word, likely understood.
    *   **"Key feature":** Fairly straightforward.
    *   **"Harappan Civilization":** This is a proper noun, directly from their history lessons. It's the specific topic.
    *   **"Urban planning":** This is the most significant English vocabulary demand. While they might have learned about "nagar niyojan" (city planning) in Hindi, linking it to "urban planning" in English could be a challenge. However, the *content* associated with it (streets, drainage) is usually presented simply.
    *   **Overall:** The sentence structure is simple. The main hurdle is the term "urban planning" itself, but the alternatives provided in the rubric (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks) are concrete and easily recallable concepts if they've studied the topic.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily a **recall** question. Students are expected to retrieve specific factual information about the Harappan Civilization's characteristics that they have learned. There's no complex application or abstract reasoning required. They just need to remember *one* of the several well-known features.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical:** Textbook exercises often ask "List features of Harappan cities" or "What was special about Harappan drainage?" This question is very similar, perhaps slightly more open-ended by asking for "one key feature" rather than a specific type of feature (e.g., only drainage).
    *   **Comparison:** It's a standard, direct recall question that aligns well with the learning objectives for this topic. It's not designed to trick or demand advanced analytical skills. The "one key feature" makes it relatively easy as students only need to remember *one* of the prominent characteristics, not all of them.

**Synthesis of Factors:**

*   **Positive:** The topic is fundamental and widely covered. The question asks for only *one* feature, and several very distinct and easily remembered features exist (drainage, grid, bricks). It's a direct recall question, which is generally easier than application or reasoning for this demographic.
*   **Negative:** English language proficiency is a significant barrier, especially for "urban planning." Even if they know the Hindi equivalent and the concepts, making the connection in English is crucial. The general average pass rate of 29% for items on the exam suggests a challenging testing environment overall. Economic background and limited exposure can also impact general academic preparedness and test-taking skills.

Given that "urban planning" is a core concept taught in conjunction with the Harappan Civilization, and features like the drainage system are often highlighted as revolutionary, students who have engaged with the material, even superficially, might remember these. The low overall pass rate on the exam, however, strongly suggests that many students will struggle, either due to language, poor recall, or general academic weaknesses.

I believe a significant portion *could* recall at least one basic feature, but the language barrier and general low academic performance will drag the score down.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%**

**Justification for 35%:**
*   It's a foundational topic in Class 6/7 history.
*   Multiple distinct, easily rememberable features are acceptable (drainage, grid, bricks).
*   It's pure recall, not application or complex reasoning.
*   The "one key feature" aspect is forgiving.
*   However, the "urban planning" terminology in English, combined with the generally low average pass rate (29%) and the profile of the students (EWS, Hindi medium, limited English), means it won't be exceptionally high. It's slightly above the average pass rate because it's a very direct
