Let's break down the question and its context to arrive at an estimate.

**Contrastive Analysis of "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographic Literacy:** Basic understanding of what a "mountain range" is.
    *   **Indian Geography:** Knowledge of major physical features of India, specifically its mountain ranges.
    *   **Recall:** Students need to have encountered and remembered the names of at least two prominent mountain ranges within India. These are typically covered in Class 6 Social Science (Geography) textbooks, often with maps.
    *   **Categorization:** Implicitly, students need to distinguish mountain ranges from other landforms (e.g., rivers, plateaus, plains).

2.  **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **"Name":** A straightforward verb, likely understood.
    *   **"any two":** Simple quantifier, generally clear.
    *   **"major":** This adjective might be slightly tricky. Students might know many ranges but struggle to differentiate "major" from minor ones. However, the most commonly taught ones (Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Ghats) are indeed major.
    *   **"mountain ranges":** This is the key vocabulary. While "mountain" (पर्वत/पहाड़) is a common word, "range" (श्रृंखला) might be less familiar as a combined term in English. However, in Social Science, these terms are often introduced together.
    *   **"located in India":** Clear geographical constraint.

    *   **Overall Language Difficulty:** Relatively low. The sentence structure is simple subject-verb-object. The core nouns ("mountain," "India") are probably known. The challenge is primarily with the specific term "mountain ranges" in English, though it's a fundamental geographic term taught early. Many students would likely recognize the names of the ranges even if their English understanding of "range" is nascent.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Primarily Recall:** This is a direct recall question. Students need to retrieve specific facts (names of mountain ranges) from memory. There's no application of concepts or complex reasoning involved.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Easier to Moderate:**
        *   **Easier:** Compared to questions requiring analysis, interpretation of maps, or explaining processes. This is a basic "what is it called" type of question.
        *   **Easier:** The rubric only requires *one* correct name for a score. This significantly lowers the bar.
        *   **Moderate:** It's not a simple definition. It requires specific factual knowledge of Indian geography. Typical textbook exercises would include "Name the following..." questions for various physical features. This fits right in.
        *   **Common Content:** Mountain ranges are foundational geography for Class 6. The Himalayas, Aravallis, Vindhyas, Satpuras, and Ghats are almost universally taught and marked on maps.

**Factors for Estimate:**

*   **Low English Proficiency:** While the language is simple, the specific term "mountain ranges" might be a hurdle for some. However, many students in government schools, even Hindi-medium, are exposed to English social science terms, especially in Class 6.
*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** This can imply less exposure to supplementary learning materials, fewer resources at home, and potentially less parental support for academic studies. However, teachers in these schools often focus heavily on core textbook content.
*   **Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is a critical baseline. Our question needs to be compared against this.
*   **Recall Question:** Generally, recall questions can have higher success rates if the information is well-drilled.
*   **Foundational Topic:** Indian mountain ranges are a core part of the Class 6 geography syllabus.
*   **Low Bar for Score (1 correct for 0.5 points):** This is a huge advantage. Even if a student struggles to recall two, recalling one (e.g., Himalayas, which is extremely prominent) will get them partial credit.

**Considering all factors:**

The question is a direct recall of fundamental geographic knowledge. The language demand is present but not excessive. The rubric is very lenient. While the overall pass rate is low, this specific item seems designed to test a basic, well-drilled fact. The Himalayas, for instance, are almost universally known.

Many students would likely know "Himalayas." A significant portion would also know "Aravalli" or "Vindhya."

**Estimated Proportion Correct:** 45%
