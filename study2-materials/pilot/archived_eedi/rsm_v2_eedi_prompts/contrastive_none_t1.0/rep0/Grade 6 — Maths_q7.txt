Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school.

**Question:** At `10` am in the morning, the temperature of Jodhpur was `30^0 C`. If the temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour, then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?
**Rubric:** Calculates the time elapsed from `10:00` am to `4:00` pm as `6` hours.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Time:** Students need to understand am/pm, telling time on a clock (digital or analog, though digital is simpler for calculation). They need to understand the concept of "per hour" and how to calculate elapsed time across noon.
    *   **Numbers:** Basic arithmetic (addition, multiplication).
    *   **Temperature:** Understanding of temperature units (degrees Celsius) and that temperature can increase. This is generally covered in primary science/EVS.
    *   **Problem-Solving:** Ability to break down a word problem into steps.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   "At 10 am in the morning": Relatively straightforward. "Morning" reinforces "am."
    *   "temperature of Jodhpur was 30^0 C": Clear factual statement. "Temperature" is a common word, often seen in weather reports.
    *   "If the temperature increases by 2^0 C per hour": "Increases by" is a key phrase. "Per hour" is also crucial. These are common mathematical phrases, but for a student with limited English, they might require careful decoding. "Per" can be a tricky preposition.
    *   "then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?": "What will be" implies a future calculation. "Evening" reinforces "pm."
    *   **Overall:** The sentence structure is relatively simple. The vocabulary is mostly numbers, units, and common time/change words. However, "increases by" and "per hour" are critical operational phrases. A student might understand "increase" but struggle with "per hour" in the context of multiplication without a clear conceptual understanding or direct translation in their native language.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily an **application** problem. Students need to apply their knowledge of time calculation, rate of change, and basic arithmetic to a real-world scenario.
    *   It requires some **reasoning** to correctly identify the steps:
        1.  Calculate total time elapsed.
        2.  Calculate total temperature increase.
        3.  Add increase to initial temperature.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Typical Textbook Exercise (Easy):** "If a car travels 50 km per hour, how far does it travel in 3 hours?" (Direct multiplication, time already given).
    *   **Typical Textbook Exercise (Medium):** "If the temperature is 25 degrees and increases by 3 degrees, what is the new temperature?" (Simple addition).
    *   **This Question (Medium-Hard):**
        *   **Difficulty Jump 1:** Calculating elapsed time from `10:00` am to `4:00` pm involves crossing noon. This is a common point of error for Class 6 students who might just subtract `10` from `4` or struggle with the `12`-hour clock cycle. They need to understand `10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`. This is the first critical step for the rubric.
        *   **Difficulty Jump 2:** Combining the rate of change ("per hour") with the calculated elapsed time requires multiplication.
        *   **Difficulty Jump 3:** The final step of adding the increase to the initial temperature.
        *   The multi-step nature and the time calculation (especially crossing noon) make it more challenging than a single-operation problem. The language, while not overly complex, does require understanding of key mathematical prepositions/phrases.

**Specific to the Rubric:** The rubric focuses solely on "Calculates the time elapsed from `10:00` am to `4:00` pm as `6` hours." This is the *first critical step* of the problem. If a student gets this wrong, the rest of the calculation will also be wrong. This step requires understanding time intervals across AM/PM.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for general items, and the challenges outlined:
