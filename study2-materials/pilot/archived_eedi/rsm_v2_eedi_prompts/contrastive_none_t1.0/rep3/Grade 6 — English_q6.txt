Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the specified context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poem Comprehension:** The student must have understood the poem to some extent to be able to identify lines and form an opinion about them. This is a significant assumption given limited English proficiency.
    *   **Vocabulary:** They need to understand the words within the poem itself.
    *   **Basic Opinion Formation:** The ability to express a preference ("like the most").
    *   **Causal Reasoning:** The ability to explain *why* they like a particular line. This is more complex than just stating a preference.
    *   **Identifying "Line":** They need to know what a "line" in a poem refers to.
    *   **Writing/Transcription:** The ability to either quote the line or accurately refer to it.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **"Which line...":** Relatively straightforward.
    *   **"...from the poem...":** Straightforward.
    *   **"...do you like the most...":** "Like" is common, "most" is comparative, which might be slightly harder but generally understood in context.
    *   **"...and why?":** This is the biggest language hurdle. "Why" demands an explanatory sentence or phrase. Students might struggle to articulate their reasons in English, even if they have an internal feeling. They might default to very simple, repetitive answers, or struggle to form grammatically correct explanations. The vocabulary for expressing nuanced reasons (e.g., "it evokes peace," "it paints a beautiful picture," "it reminds me of...") will likely be beyond their grasp. Simple answers like "Because it is good" or "I like it" might be all they can manage.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall (of the poem's lines):** Yes, they need to recall lines from the poem.
    *   **Application (of preference):** Yes, applying their personal taste.
    *   **Reasoning (explaining "why"):** This is the core skill tested. It's not just stating a fact or recalling information; it requires justification and articulation of personal feeling, which is a higher-order thinking skill, especially in a non-native language.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 6 textbook exercises often focus on:
        *   **Literal comprehension:** "Who did X?", "What happened when Y?"
        *   **Vocabulary matching/fill-in-the-blanks.**
        *   **Simple grammar exercises.**
        *   **Recall of factual information.**
    *   This question goes beyond simple comprehension and recall. It asks for subjective opinion and reasoned justification. This makes it significantly harder than many typical exercises. While some textbooks might include "What do you think?" type questions, the expectation of a well-articulated "why" in English for these students is a high bar.
    *   The rubric (Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why) confirms the expectation of both components. Getting *both* right, especially the "why" in a comprehensible English sentence, will be challenging.

**Synthesizing the Difficulty:**

The question itself is conceptually simple for a native speaker. However, for a Class 6 student from an economically weaker section attending a Hindi-medium school with limited English proficiency:

1.  **Poem Comprehension:** This is the foundational barrier. If they didn't understand the poem, they can't genuinely pick a line and explain why.
2.  **Vocabulary for "Why":** Articulating reasons in English is the biggest hurdle. Even if they feel something internally, expressing it beyond "because it is good" will be difficult.
3.  **Subjectivity:** Expressing a personal opinion and justifying it requires more cognitive and linguistic effort than answering a factual question.
4.  **Rubric Requirements:** Simply naming a line might get partial credit (if applicable, but the rubric suggests both parts are needed for full score), but the "why" component is crucial for getting the full score of 1.5.

Given the average pass rate across items is 29%, this particular item seems *more difficult* than average due to the demands for subjective reasoning and articulation in limited English. A student might correctly identify a line but fail to provide a coherent "why," or provide a very simplistic "why" that might or might not meet the 'mentions why' threshold effectively for full marks.
