Let's break down the question and estimate the proportion of Class 8 students who would answer it correctly, considering the given context.

**Contrastive Analysis of the Question:**

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Core Concept:** Decomposition/Rotting of organic matter.
    *   **Specifics:**
        *   Understanding that organic matter (plants, vegetables, fruits) is waste.
        *   Knowledge that putting it in a pit can lead to changes over time.
        *   Basic understanding of *what* those changes are (decay, reduction in volume, change in appearance/smell).
        *   Connection between decomposed organic matter and soil health (manure/compost).
        *   *Less assumed:* Microorganisms' role in decomposition (though implied by the process).

**2. Language Demands:**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "gardener," "collected," "waste," "plants," "vegetables," "fruits," "pit," "notice," "change," "some days," "reasons," "evaluate," "beneficial," "soil health."
        *   Most of these are fairly common words, even for students with limited English, especially in a science context where they might have encountered them. "Evaluate" might be slightly more demanding than "explain" or "describe."
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple, direct questions. "Does X happen? Give reasons and evaluate if Y is beneficial." This structure is straightforward.
    *   **Overall:** The language is accessible. It avoids complex scientific jargon. The main challenge would be if students only learn these concepts in Hindi and don't have English equivalents, but the core ideas are universally understood.

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **"Does gardener notice any change after some days?"** This is primarily **recall** of a common observation or a basic science concept (decomposition).
    *   **"Give reasons..."** This requires **recall** of the underlying process (rotting, action of microbes, breakdown). It also involves a degree of **application** if they connect it to real-world observations.
    *   **"...and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health."** This is **application** and basic **reasoning**. They need to connect the decomposed matter to its role as manure/compost and its positive impact on soil.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Familiarity:** This scenario (a pit for waste, decomposition) is a very common example used when teaching about waste management, composting, and soil health in Class 8. It's often a practical activity or a diagram in textbooks.
    *   **Complexity:** It's not overly complex. It doesn't require calculations, deep theoretical understanding of chemical reactions, or intricate biological processes. It's about observable changes and their practical implications.
    *   **Expected Depth:** A Class 8 student is expected to know about decomposition and its benefit for soil. This question directly targets that knowledge.
    *   **Compared to "Average":** Given that the average pass rate is 29%, this question feels like it should be on the *easier* side of the spectrum for a science question, as it hits a fundamental, practical, and commonly taught topic. It's not a trick question, nor does it require obscure facts.

**Rubric Consideration:**
The rubric only requires suggesting "significant changes." This is a very low bar.
*   **"significant changes"**: Students might simply say "it will rot," "it will smell bad," "it will reduce in volume," "it will become soil." Any of these would fulfill the rubric.
*   **"Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health"**: While the rubric only scores on the "significant changes" part, a student likely won't just stop there. If they understand the changes, they'll likely also have an idea about the reasons and benefits, as these concepts are usually taught together.

**Factors that might hinder students:**
*   **English proficiency:** While the words are common, if their core instruction is entirely in Hindi and they haven't encountered these terms in English, it could be a barrier. However, "waste," "plants," "fruits," "change," "soil" are relatively basic.
*   **Lack of direct experience:** Some students might not have seen a composting pit, but the concept is usually taught explicitly.
*   **General exam anxiety/comprehension issues:** Even if they know the answer, misinterpreting the question due to stress or limited English can happen.

**Conclusion for Difficulty:**
This question is **relatively easy** for a Class 8 science student in India, particularly on the "Does gardener notice any change" part, which is
