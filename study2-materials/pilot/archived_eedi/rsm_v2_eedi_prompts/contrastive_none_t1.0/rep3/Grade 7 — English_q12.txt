Let's break down the question for Class 7 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Grammar Concepts:** A fundamental understanding of verbs, subjects, and objects. Crucially, they need to know what "active voice" and "passive voice" are. This is a specific grammar concept that is typically introduced around Class 6 or 7 in many Indian curricula (often in Hindi as "कर्तृवाच्य" and "कर्मवाच्य").
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "wind" (हवा) - common word.
        *   "blew" (blow का भूतकाल, उड़ाया) - common verb.
        *   "leaves" (पत्तियां) - common word.
        *   "away" (दूर) - common word.
        *   "sentence" (वाक्य) - common word in a grammar context.
        *   "Active Voice" (कर्तृवाच्य) - technical term.
        *   "Passive Voice" (कर्मवाच्य) - technical term.
        *   "Change" (बदलना) - common instruction.
    *   **Verb Forms:** They need to know the past participle form of "blow," which is "blown." This is an irregular verb, and memorizing such forms is a standard part of English grammar learning at this stage.

*   **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **Instructional Language:** The instruction "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" contains technical grammar terms. While these terms are taught in English grammar classes, students with limited overall English proficiency might struggle to *immediately* parse the instruction if they haven't thoroughly internalized the meaning of "active voice" and "passive voice" in English. They might know the Hindi equivalents better.
    *   **Sentence Language:** The sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" uses common vocabulary and a simple sentence structure. This part is not a major hurdle.
    *   **Producing Passive Voice:** Constructing the passive voice sentence correctly ("The leaves were blown away by the wind") requires:
        *   Identifying the object ("the leaves").
        *   Using the correct form of "to be" (past tense, plural: "were").
        *   Using the past participle of the main verb ("blown").
        *   Adding "by" + original subject ("by the wind").
        *   Placing "away" correctly.
    *   **Irregular Verb:** "Blew" -> "blown" is an irregular verb. Students frequently make mistakes with irregular past participles (e.g., saying "blowed" or getting the tense wrong).

*   **Type of Task:**
    *   This is primarily **application** of a learned grammatical rule. It's not simple recall (like defining active voice) or complex reasoning/problem-solving. It requires applying a formulaic transformation.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a *very typical* exercise found in Class 7 English grammar textbooks when teaching voice transformation. It's a standard, direct application question. It's not obscure, unusually complex, or tricky. The vocabulary in the example sentence is also very common.

**Factors making it harder:**
*   **Abstract Grammar Concepts:** "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" are abstract concepts. Understanding and applying them in English can be challenging for students whose primary language of instruction is Hindi, even if they've been taught the concepts.
*   **Irregular Verb:** "Blew" to "blown" is a common trap.
*   **Multiple Steps:** It requires several steps: identify object, identify correct 'to be' form, identify past participle, add 'by' and subject. Each step is a potential point of error.
*   **Limited English Exposure:** While grammar rules are taught, the fluidity to apply them quickly and accurately in an exam setting, especially for students with less exposure to English outside the classroom, can be low.

**Factors making it easier:**
*   **Standard Exercise:** This is a routine exercise; students would have practiced many similar sentences.
*   **Simple Sentence Structure:** The original sentence is straightforward (Subject-Verb-Object).
*   **Common Vocabulary:** No obscure words in the original sentence.
*   **Targeted Skill:** The question directly tests a specific, often-repeated grammar topic.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%):**
The average pass rate of 29% suggests that even common items are challenging. This particular item, while standard, requires a strong grasp of both the concept and its application, including irregular verb forms. If 29% is the *average* for a range of items
