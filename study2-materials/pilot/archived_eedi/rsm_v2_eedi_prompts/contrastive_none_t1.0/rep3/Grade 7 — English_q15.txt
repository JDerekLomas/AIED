Let's break down the question for a Class 7 student in an Indian government school, considering the typical profile:

**Contrastive Analysis of Difficulty:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low:** The topic "My Favourite Hobby" is highly relatable and personal. Every student likely has some activity they enjoy, even if they don't explicitly label it a "hobby." No specific academic content knowledge (science, history, math) is required.
    *   **Basic writing mechanics:** Knowledge of sentence structure, capitalization, punctuation (full stops are essential for paragraphs), and basic vocabulary. This is a standard expectation by Class 7, though proficiency varies widely.
    *   **Concept of a paragraph:** Understanding that a paragraph is a group of related sentences. This would have been introduced earlier.

*   **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **Moderate-High:**
        *   **Vocabulary:** "Favourite," "hobby," "mention," "enjoy." While "favourite" and "enjoy" are common, "hobby" might be slightly less frequent than everyday words for some, especially if their primary instruction is in Hindi. However, it's a very common exam topic. "Mention" is a key instruction verb that might pose a slight challenge for comprehension.
        *   **Sentence Structure:** Students need to construct 4-5 grammatically coherent English sentences. This requires basic subject-verb agreement, correct tense usage (present tense for describing a hobby), and appropriate conjunctions or transitions.
        *   **Instruction Comprehension:** Understanding "Write a short paragraph," "Mention what it is," "when you do it," and "why you enjoy it." This multi-part instruction requires careful reading and understanding of each component. For students with limited English, "mention" and distinguishing between "what," "when," and "why" could be a stumbling block. They might write about *what* it is, but struggle to articulate *when* and *why* with sufficient detail in English.
        *   **Lexical availability:** Even if they understand the instructions, retrieving appropriate English words and phrases to describe their specific hobby, when they do it, and their reasons for enjoyment can be difficult. For example, describing "playing cricket with friends in the evening after school because it makes me feel energetic and happy" requires more than just basic survival English.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Application & Personal Expression:** This is primarily an application task. Students need to apply their knowledge of English sentence structure and vocabulary to express personal information. It's not rote recall of facts, nor complex logical reasoning. It requires them to retrieve personal experiences and translate them into written English.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Similar, but potentially more demanding:** "My Favourite Hobby" or "My Best Friend" are very common essay/paragraph topics in English textbooks from Class 5 onwards. The *topic* itself is familiar.
    *   **The specific constraints increase difficulty:** The instruction "4-5 sentences" is helpful guidance but also a soft constraint. The explicit "Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" provides scaffolding but also *three distinct points* that need to be addressed *within* the short paragraph. Many students might manage to describe the hobby, but articulating *when* and especially *why* (beyond a simple "it is fun") in grammatically correct English can be challenging.
    *   **Rubric's strictness:** "Student writes a complete paragraph that clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable." This means *all three* elements must be present and *clear*. Partial answers would not score. This makes it harder than simply "write something about your hobby."

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%):**

The average pass rate is very low. This suggests that most items on the exam are challenging for these students. This "My Favourite Hobby" question, while relatable, still demands a reasonable level of functional English writing.

Many students will:
*   Understand the general topic.
*   Be able to write a few simple sentences.
*   Struggle with grammatical correctness (tenses, subject-verb agreement).
*   Struggle to address all three bullet points (what, when, why) clearly and cohesively within 4-5 sentences in English.
*   Lack the vocabulary to express nuanced reasons for enjoyment.
*   Potentially just list activities rather than forming a coherent paragraph.

Given the low average pass rate for the exam, and the multiple demands of this specific item (multi-part instruction, paragraph structure, articulation of personal reasons in English, grammatical correctness required for clarity), I expect it to be more difficult than items that require simple recall or single-word answers.
