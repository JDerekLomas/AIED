Let's break down the question "Who lived inside the book?" for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Basic literacy in English (reading and understanding simple sentences). The question uses very common, high-frequency words.
    *   **Assumed (Implicit):** That there was a preceding text or story from which this question is drawn. This is crucial. If this question is presented in isolation without the source text, it's unanswerable. Assuming it follows a story, the student needs to have comprehended that story.
    *   **Not Assumed:** Complex vocabulary, specific domain knowledge (science, history beyond general knowledge), or advanced literary analysis.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Who," "lived," "inside," "the," "book." All are extremely common, fundamental English words typically introduced in early primary grades (Class 1-3). "Lived" might be slightly less frequent than "live" but is still basic.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple interrogative sentence (Wh-question). It's direct and doesn't involve complex clauses, inversions, or passive voice.
    *   **Cognitive Load:** Low on the linguistic front. The main challenge isn't decoding the question itself, but rather recalling the information from the associated text.
    *   **Potential Misinterpretations:** Very low. "Who" clearly asks for a person/character. "Lived" implies residence. "Inside the book" is quite literal and unambiguous.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   **Recall:** This is purely a recall question. The student needs to remember a specific detail (the resident of the book) directly stated or strongly implied in the preceding text. There's no application of a concept or complex reasoning required beyond simple comprehension.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Easier:** Many textbook exercises at this level would involve slightly more complex sentences, longer questions, or require a short explanatory answer rather than a simple factual recall. Questions asking "What happened next?" or "Why did the character do X?" would be harder.
    *   **Typical:** This question is very much on par with the simplest comprehension questions found after short stories or paragraphs in Class 3-5 English textbooks, designed to check basic understanding of plot points. It's a foundational type of question.

**Factors making it easier for this demographic:**

*   **Simple Vocabulary:** Words are highly accessible.
*   **Simple Grammar:** Direct Wh-question.
*   **Direct Recall:** No inference or application needed, assuming the information was explicitly stated in the source text.
*   **Focus on Noun:** The answer is a simple noun phrase, not a complex sentence.

**Factors making it harder for this demographic:**

*   **Prior Text Comprehension:** The *primary* difficulty isn't the question itself, but whether they understood the story it refers to. If the story was too complex, too long, or contained unfamiliar vocabulary, then answering this simple question becomes impossible.
*   **Limited English Proficiency (Overall):** While the question words are simple, students with very low overall English proficiency might struggle even with these basic building blocks, or be overwhelmed by the mere presence of English.
*   **Memory:** Remembering the specific detail from a potentially longer story.
*   **Distractions/Test Anxiety:** Standard factors.

**Conclusion of Contrastive Analysis:**
Assuming the preceding story was also written in simple English, at an appropriate reading level for Class 6 students with limited English, and explicitly stated or very clearly implied that a "magical fairy" lived inside the book, then the question itself is remarkably easy. Its difficulty hinges almost entirely on the source text's accessibility and the student's ability to retain that specific detail. The question "Who lived inside the book?" is a low-linguistic-demand, direct recall item.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Given the average pass rate across items is 29%, and considering this question is highly dependent on the *source text's* difficulty rather than its own, I'll assume the source text was at a "typical" Class 6 difficulty for this population.

*   If the source text was relatively easy and the answer "fairy" or "magical fairy" was explicitly stated and prominent: The question itself is one of the easiest possible comprehension questions.
*   If the source text was challenging, or the answer was subtle/implied, or required sifting through a lot of information: Then the low overall pass rate would kick in.

Considering it's a *very* simple direct recall
