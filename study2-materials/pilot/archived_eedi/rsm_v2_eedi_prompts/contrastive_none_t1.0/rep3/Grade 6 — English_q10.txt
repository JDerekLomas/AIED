Let's break down the question's difficulty for Class 6 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Grammar:** Basic understanding of sentence structure (subject-verb-object). More specifically, an understanding of the difference between 'some' and 'any' regarding affirmative/negative sentences and questions. This is a fundamental grammar concept typically introduced around Class 4-6.
    *   **Vocabulary:** 'apples', 'basket', 'there are', 'in the'. All are very common, basic words that would likely be known even with limited English exposure. 'Choose the correct word' is also a standard instruction.
    *   **Concept:** The concept of counting/existence (there are apples).

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Simplicity:** The sentence itself is extremely simple, using common vocabulary and a straightforward structure.
    *   **Key Distractor:** The main challenge lies *entirely* in distinguishing 'some' from 'any'. This is a specific grammatical rule. If a student doesn't know this rule, they are essentially guessing between two seemingly plausible options.
    *   **Lack of Contextual Clues:** The sentence doesn't provide strong contextual clues that would help a non-native speaker deduce the correct word if they don't know the grammatical rule. It's a pure grammar test.
    *   **"Choose the correct word" instruction:** This is standard and should be understood.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** of a grammatical rule. Students need to recall the rule for 'some' vs. 'any' and apply it to an affirmative sentence. It's not complex reasoning or a simple recall of a fact.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Format:** This is a very common fill-in-the-blanks style grammar exercise, frequently found in textbooks and workbooks at this level.
    *   **Content:** The 'some/any' distinction is a core topic in early English grammar learning for ESL students. It's not an advanced concept.
    *   **Complexity:** It's one of the simpler grammar rules. Other topics might include tenses, prepositions, or articles, which can be more complex and have more exceptions. This rule is relatively straightforward: 'some' for affirmative statements, 'any' for negative statements and questions.

**Factors Making it Easier:**
*   Very simple sentence structure and vocabulary.
*   Common grammatical topic.
*   Dichotomous choice (50% chance of guessing correctly).

**Factors Making it Harder:**
*   Requires specific grammatical knowledge that might not be consistently taught or reinforced, especially in schools with less focus on English.
*   Lack of strong contextual clues.
*   Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds might not have the intuitive grasp of this distinction that native speakers or those with strong English exposure would. They need to *learn* the rule explicitly.

**Conclusion on Difficulty:**
While the sentence is simple, the core task (distinguishing 'some' and 'any') is a *specific grammatical rule*. For students with limited English exposure, this rule might not be ingrained. They would have to have *learned* and *retained* this rule explicitly. Given the average pass rate of 29% for other items, which might include less nuanced questions, this question, while basic, relies on a specific piece of grammar knowledge. However, the fact that it's a 50/50 guess also inflates the potential score. Many will guess correctly purely by chance.

Taking into account the average pass rate across items (29%) and the nature of the question: it's a fundamental grammar point, but not necessarily intuitive for non-native speakers without explicit instruction. The 50/50 choice is a significant factor.

If students have been taught this rule reasonably well, a good number would get it. If not, it's a coin flip. Given the average pass rate and the context of government schools with potentially weaker English instruction, I'd expect performance to be higher than the average due to the simplicity of the sentence and the 50% chance factor, but not exceedingly high due to the need for specific grammar rule recall.

A student who knows the rule will get it right. A student who doesn't know the rule has a 50% chance. The total correct will be a mix of both.

Let's assume maybe 30-40% of students actually know this specific grammar rule well enough to apply it confidently. The remaining 60-70% would be guessing.
