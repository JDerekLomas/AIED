Let's break down the question for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their specific context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Syntax/Grammar:** Basic English sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object). They need to understand that "he" is the doer, "is reading" is the action, and "a book" is what is being acted upon.
    *   **Vocabulary:** All words are extremely common (book, reading, a, is, he). These are likely among the first words taught in English at primary levels.
    *   **Concept of "rearranging to make a meaningful sentence":** This is a standard type of grammar exercise introduced early in English language learning.
    *   **Tense:** Present continuous ("is reading") is a fundamental tense taught early.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** As noted, very low demand. All words are likely known, or easily inferable.
    *   **Sentence Complexity:** The target sentence "He is reading a book" is a simple, declarative sentence. There are no complex clauses, idioms, or difficult grammatical structures.
    *   **Instructions:** "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" is a common instruction for this type of question. While "rearrange" might be a slightly less common word, the context of the words provided strongly suggests the task. Even if they don't fully grasp "rearrange," the goal of making "a meaningful sentence" from a jumble of known words is usually clear.
    *   **Phonological/Orthographical:** All words are common, short, and have straightforward spellings.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of learned grammatical rules (SVO structure, present continuous).
    *   It involves a degree of **reasoning** to identify the subject, verb phrase, and object, and then put them in the correct sequence. It's not rote recall of a specific sentence, but rather applying a structural rule.
    *   It also involves some **recall** of individual word meanings and their typical grammatical roles.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Ease:** This is a very *easy* exercise, typical of what would be found in early Class 3-4 English textbooks, and certainly a common warm-up or basic practice in Class 6. It's often one of the first sentence-building exercises after introducing basic vocabulary and the present continuous tense.
    *   **Complexity:** It's much simpler than typical Class 6 comprehension passages, complex sentence transformations (e.g., active to passive, direct to indirect speech), or even slightly more complex sentence rearrangement tasks involving more words, conjunctions, or adverbials.
    *   **Distractors:** There are very few plausible incorrect arrangements that still make *some* sense, making it easier to arrive at the correct one. The most common errors would be slight word order issues, but "He is reading a book" is the overwhelmingly natural and grammatically correct option.

**Conclusion:**

Given the fundamental nature of the vocabulary, grammar, and task type, this question is remarkably straightforward for a Class 6 student, even one with limited English proficiency. It tests the most basic building blocks of English sentence formation. Compared to the average pass rate of 29% across *all* items (which would include much harder questions like reading comprehension, more complex grammar, and vocabulary), this item should perform significantly better.

The primary hurdle would be a complete lack of exposure to English sentence structure, but by Class 6, even in government schools, basic SVO structure and the present continuous tense are typically introduced and practiced.
