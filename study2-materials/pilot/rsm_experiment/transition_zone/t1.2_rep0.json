Katie's method is a very common student error: she has multiplied the $12$ and the $\\frac{x}{3}$ by $3$, but failed to multiply the $-5$ by $3$ (which would yield $x-15=36$). \n\nStudents at lower ability levels often see the \"$\\div 3$\" and \"$12$\" and assume \"$\\times 3$\" is the correct inverse, neglecting the necessity of multiplying every term in the equation. Proficient and advanced students are more likely to recognise that Katie's line is algebraically invalid.\n\nbelow_basic: A=30% B=25% C=35% D=10%\nbasic: A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%\nproficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%\nadvanced: A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%"

This is a very common BIDMAS/PEMDAS error.\n- **Option C:** Multiplying $3$ by $0.3$ and then multiplying by $2$ (confusing squaring with doubling), or $3 \\times 0.3 \\times 2 = 1.8$.\n\nbelow_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%\nbasic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%\nproficient: A=20% B=65% C=5% D=10%\nadvanced: A=5% B=92% C=1% D=2%"

However, in Step 2, he makes a common sign error: instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to get $k=59$, he adds 1 to 60. Therefore, only Step 1 is correct.\n\nBelow basic students often struggle with the initial inverse operation (multiplication) or assume that if an answer is reached, the process must be correct, leading them to choose C. Basic students generally recognise the first step but frequently fall for the \"add 1\" trap in the second step. Proficient students usually spot the sign error in Step 2.
