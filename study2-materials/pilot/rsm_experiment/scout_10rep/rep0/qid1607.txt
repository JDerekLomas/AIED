## Step 1: Analyzing the given equation and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \( k \), we first multiply both sides by 4 to get \( 60 = 1 + k \). Then, we subtract 1 from both sides to get \( 59 = k \). Isaac's steps are: Step \( 1: 60 = 1 + k \) and Step \( 2: 61 = k \).

## 2: Evaluating Isaac's steps for correctness
Step 1 is correct because multiplying both sides of the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \) by 4 indeed yields \( 60 = 1 + k \). However, Step 2 is incorrect because subtracting 1 from \( 60 = 1 + k \) gives \( 59 = k \), not \( 61 = k \).

## 3: Identifying the error for each wrong answer
A) Only step 1: A student might choose this if they recognize Step 1 as correct but haven't checked Step 2 or believe Step 2 is incorrect.
B) Only step 2: A student would choose this if they incorrectly believe Step 2 is correct and didn't properly check Step 1 or made a mistake in their verification.
C) Both steps are correct: This would indicate a student who incorrectly believes both steps are valid, likely due to not checking the arithmetic in Step 2 properly.
D) Both steps are incorrect: A student would choose this if they recognize that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect, or if they made an error in evaluating both steps.

## 4: Specific errors leading to wrong answers
A) A student choosing A might understand the first step but not verify the second, or they might see the mistake in Step 2 but not know how to articulate it.
B) Choosing B suggests a student verifies Step 2 incorrectly or doesn't properly assess Step 1.
C) Choosing C indicates a failure to verify the arithmetic in both steps correctly.
D) Choosing D suggests a student correctly identifies that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is not, or they correctly assess both steps' validity.

## 5: Predicting response distribution based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and verification. They might choose B or C due to lack of understanding or verification skills.
- **Basic**: Students here have foundational skills but might make careless mistakes. They could choose A, B, or C due to incomplete verification.
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebra and should see that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect, likely choosing A or D.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will easily see the correctness of Step 1 and the error in Step 2, likely choosing A or D with a strong understanding.

## 6: Detailed Predictions
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (partial understanding), B=30% (incorrectly validates Step 2), C=30% (fails to verify both), D=20% (some recognize both are not fully correct).
- **Basic**: A=40% (recognize Step 1's correctness), B=20% (error in verification), C=20% (incomplete verification), D=20% (correctly assess both).
- **Proficient**: A=60% (correctly identify Step 1 as correct, question Step 2), B=10% (misunderstanding), C=5% (rarely would they think both are correct), D=25% (correct assessment).
- **Advanced**: A=80% (clear understanding of both steps), B=5%, C=0% (very rarely would they think both are correct), D=15%.

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might choose this if they recognize Step 1 as correct but haven't checked Step 2 or believe Step 2 is incorrect.
