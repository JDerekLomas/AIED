## Step 1: Identify the correct calculation for the terms indicated by the arrows.
The terms indicated by the arrows are -1 from the first bracket and -4 from the second bracket. When multiplying these two terms, the calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## 2: Analyze the error for option A) \( +4 \).
To arrive at \(+4\), a student would actually perform the correct calculation, as \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\). This option does not represent an error in calculation.

## 3: Analyze the error for option B) \( -4 \).
For a student to choose \(-4\), they would mistakenly calculate \((-1) \times (-4)\) as \(-(1 \times 4)\) or incorrectly apply the rule for multiplying negative numbers, thinking it results in a negative.

## 4: Analyze the error for option C) \( +5 \).
Choosing \(+5\) would indicate a student incorrectly calculates or guesses the product of \(-1\) and \(-4\), possibly adding the numbers or making another calculation mistake.

## 5: Analyze the error for option D) \( -5 \).
For \( -5 \), a student might incorrectly multiply \(-1\) by \(-4\) and then either add or subtract an incorrect value, or simply guess.

## 6: Specific error analysis.
A) Correct calculation, no error: \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).
B) Incorrect application of multiplication rule for negatives: thinking \((-1) \times (-4) = -4\).
C) Random or incorrect calculation: \((-1) \times (-4) = 5\), possibly due to miscalculation or incorrect method.
D) Incorrect calculation: similar to C, but with a result of \(-5\).

## 7: Error Analysis Summary.
A) A student with a correct understanding would choose this, no specific error.
B) Misapplication of negative multiplication rule.
C) Incorrect calculation or guesswork leading to \(+5\).
D) Similar to C, but resulting in \(-5\).

## 8: Predict the response distribution based on student ability levels.
- Below_basic: Students with limited understanding might guess or apply wrong rules frequently. So, A=10% (correct), B=20% (wrong negative application), C=30% (random guess), D=40% (another guess).
- Basic: Students with some understanding might still make calculation errors. So, A=40% (correct), B=25% (wrong rule), C=20% (guess), D=15% (another mistake).
- Proficient: Students who understand the concept would mostly choose the correct answer. So, A=80% (correct), B=10% (minor mistake), C=5% (rare guess), D=5% (rare mistake).
- Advanced: These students would nearly always choose the correct answer. So, A=95% (correct), B=3% (rare mistake), C=1% (very rare), D=1% (very rare).

## 9: Adjust and Finalize Predictions.
Given typical student performance:
- Below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
- Basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
- Proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- Advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student would choose this with correct calculation or no error.
B) A student might choose this by misapplying the rule for multiplying two negative numbers.
C) A student might choose this through incorrect calculation or guessing.
D) A student might select this through a different incorrect calculation or guessing.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
