## Step 1: Analyzing the question and the options provided
The question asks students to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct expansion is \((m-5)(m-7) = m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\). Let's examine each option to understand the potential errors.

## 2: Error Analysis for option A
A) \( m^{2}-2 m-35 \) - To arrive at this answer, a student might incorrectly multiply the terms: \(m \times m = m^2\), \(-5 \times -7 = 35\), but then incorrectly combine the middle terms \(-7m - 5m\) as \(-2m\) instead of \(-12m\), possibly due to a miscalculation or incorrect application of algebraic rules.

## 3: Error Analysis for option B
B) \( m^{2}-12 m+35 \) - This is actually the correct answer. No error is made here.

## 4: Error Analysis for option C
C) \( m^{2}+12 m+35 \) - A student might choose this if they incorrectly add the middle terms: \(m \times -7 + -5 \times m = -7m - 5m = -12m\), but then mistakenly adds \(35\) without changing the sign of the product of the constants (which is correct) but could mistakenly add the \(m\) terms to get a positive \(12m\) term if they forget to distribute or incorrectly handle the signs.

## 5: Error Analysis for option D
D) \( m^{2}-12 m-35 \) - For this option, a student could have correctly expanded \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\) but then incorrectly subtracted \(35\) instead of adding it, or misinterpreted the signs when multiplying and adding the terms.

## 6: Predictions
Given the standard progression of math skills and common misconceptions:

- **Below Basic**: Students may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not even attempt to simplify or make significant errors in sign and coefficient calculations. A might seem plausible due to less thorough calculation, B is correct but requires accuracy, C seems unlikely due to positive term, and D seems a common error with sign changes.

- **Basic**: Students here have foundational understanding but might make calculation errors, especially with signs and combining like terms.

- **Proficient**: These students have a good grasp but might rush or misread. They are less likely to choose A or C due to understanding algebraic rules.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students are least likely to make these errors.

## 7: Percentage Predictions
Making speculative predictions based on likely student performance and errors.

### below_basic
- **A=30%** (simple miscalculation, omitting correct processes), 
- **B=40%** (the odd one out where luck plays, if they follow a common template), 
- **C=15%** (due to complete misinterpretation),
- **D=15%** (consistent error with signs and terms).

### basic
- **A=20%**, 
- **B=55%**, 
- **C=10%**, 
- **D=15%**.

### proficient
- **A=10%**, 
- **B=80%**, 
- **C=5%**, 
- **D=5%**.

### advanced
- **A=5%**, 
- **B=90%**, 
- **C=2%**, 
- **D=3%**.

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might incorrectly combine the middle terms as -2m instead of -12m.
B) Correct answer, no error.
C) A student might incorrectly get a positive 12m term.
D) A student might incorrectly subtract 35 instead of adding.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=55% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
