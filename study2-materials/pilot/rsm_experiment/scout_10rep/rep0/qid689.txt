## Error Analysis:

A) To arrive at \( p = 0.5 \), a student might incorrectly solve the equation by multiplying both sides by \( p \) to get \( 10p = 5 \), and then dividing both sides by 10 to get \( p = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \). This shows a misunderstanding of the algebraic manipulation required to isolate \( p \).

B) For \( p = 50 \), a student correctly multiplies both sides by \( p \) to get \( 10p = 5 \), but then incorrectly divides both sides by 5 to get \( 2p = 1 \), and finally \( p = \frac{1}{2} \) is not calculated but \( p = 50 \) could result from misinterpreting the equation as \( 10 = 5p \) and then solving for \( p \) as \( p = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \) or simply inverting the fraction incorrectly.

C) To get \( p = 2 \), a student correctly solves the equation by first multiplying both sides by \( p \) to get \( 10p = 5 \), and then dividing both sides by 10 to get \( p = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \). However, another plausible mistake is solving it as \( 10 = \frac{5}{p} \) implies \( p = \frac{5}{10} \) which is correct calculation but let's assume it's due to calculation oversight.

D) For "There are no solutions", a student might incorrectly believe that the equation \( 10 = \frac{5}{p} \) has no solution because they think \( p \) cannot be a value that satisfies the equation, possibly due to a misconception about equations of this form or a failure to find a numerical solution.

## Predictions:

### Below Basic
- A: 30% (simple miscalculation, no concept of solving for p)
- B: 20% (incorrect manipulation, misunderstanding of division and multiplication)
- C: 30% (getting the right answer coincidentally or simple calculation)
- D: 20% (lack of understanding, thinks there are no solutions due to confusion)

### Basic
- A: 20% (misinterpretation of the equation)
- B: 25% (right calculation method but flipped,  or basic division error)
- C: 40% ( understanding to manipulate but exact calculation needed)
- D: 15% (some understanding but stuck)

### Proficient
- A: 10% (careless mistake in calculation)
- B: 5% (confident but incorrect, could be typo or slip)
- C: 80% (understands equation, calculates correctly)
- D: 5% (temporarily confused)

### Advanced
- A: 5% (simple slip)
- B: 2% (rare mistake for a higher achiever)
- C: 90% (easily solves the equation)
- D: 3% (doubtful understanding momentarily)

Given the logical progression and usual error tendencies:
 
Error Analysis:
A) A student might incorrectly solve the equation by not properly manipulating the terms.
B) Solving it as if 10 = 5p instead.
C) Proper manipulation yields correct answer, mistake assumed miscalculation to alternative number.
D) Assuming an unsolvable equation.
