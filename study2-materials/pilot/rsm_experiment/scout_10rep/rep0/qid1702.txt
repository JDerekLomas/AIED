## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the table of values.
The equation given is $10x - 6y = 30$. We need to find the value of $x$ when $y = 0.5$.

## 2: Substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation to find $x$.
Substituting $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$, we get $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$. This simplifies to $10x - 3 = 30$.

## 3: Solve for $x$.
Adding 3 to both sides gives $10x = 33$. Dividing both sides by 10 gives $x = 3.3$.

## 4: Analyze the error for each wrong answer.
A) $4.25$: A student might arrive at this answer by incorrectly solving the equation, perhaps by adding 3 to 30 and then dividing by 10 but making a calculation error: $10x = 30 + 6(0.5) = 30 + 3 = 33$, then $x = 33 / 10 = 3.3$, but if they thought $6y = 6(0.5) = 3$ and then did $10x = 30 + 3 = 33$ correctly but wrote $33/10 = 4.25$ due to miscalculation.
B) $-4.25$: This could result from a student mistakenly using $-6y$ as $+6y$ or incorrectly rearranging the equation: $10x = 30 - 6(0.5) = 30 - 3 = 27$, then $x = 27 / 10 = 2.7$, or making a sign error in solving.
C) $3.3$: This is the correct answer. A student choosing another option might be mistaken.
D) $2.7$: A student might get this by incorrectly solving: $10x = 30 - 3 = 27$, then $x = 2.7$.

## 5: Specific error analysis for each option.
A) A student might incorrectly calculate $10x = 30 + 6 = 36$ (wrongly adding 6 instead of 3) and get $x = 3.6$; actually, it seems they made a miscalculation from $10x -3 = 30$.
B) Could come from mistakenly calculating as $10x + 3 = 30$ or similar sign errors leading to $10x = 27$ then misinterpreting.
C) Correct calculation yields $x = 3.3$.
D) As calculated when assuming $10x -3 = 30$, which actually leads directly to the right method.

## 6: Correct errors.
The error to get A ($4.25$) could be dividing 42.5 by 10 (since $10x = 30 + 6*0.5$). For B ($-4.25$), could assume $-10x = 30 +3$, then multiply by $-1$. For D ($2.7$) seems actually aligned.

## 7: Errors align to choices:
- A seems to imply mistaken value assignments.
- B misinterprets equation solution entirely.
- C is right as $10x -3 =30, so $10x=33; then 3.3.

## 8: Make distribution predictions based on math ability levels.
- **Below_basic**: Struggle with equation setup. Randomness or simple guess.
- **Basic**: Some get C, mixup leads to A and D; unlikely B, no deep insight.
- **Proficient**: Understand most; hence majority go for C; A, D via oversight or step miscalculation.

## 9: Estimating precise distribution difficult; reason to each ability:
Predictions:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
