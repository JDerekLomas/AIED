## Step 1: Analyzing the given equation and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \( k \), we first multiply both sides by 4 to get \( 60 = 1 + k \). Then, we subtract 1 from both sides to get \( 59 = k \). Isaac's steps are: Step \( 1: 60 = 1 + k \) and Step \( 2: 61 = k \).

## 2: Evaluating Isaac's steps for correctness
Isaac's Step \( 1: 60 = 1 + k \) is correct because multiplying both sides of the original equation by 4 yields \( 60 = 1 + k \). However, his Step \( 2: 61 = k \) is incorrect because solving \( 60 = 1 + k \) for \( k \) gives \( k = 60 - 1 = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 3: Identifying the specific errors for each wrong answer
A) Only step \( 1 \) is correct: This would be chosen by someone who recognizes Step \( 1 \) is correct but does not evaluate Step \( 2 \) properly or recognizes Step \( 2 \) as incorrect.
B) Only step \( 2 \) is correct: This would be a misconception where a student thinks Step \( 2 \) is correct but not Step \( 1 \), which is not possible given the derivation.
C) Both steps are correct: This would be chosen by a student who incorrectly thinks both steps logically follow and are mathematically correct.
D) Both steps are incorrect: This would be chosen by a student who correctly identifies that Step \( 1 \) is correct but Step \( 2 \) is not, or understands that the final solution for \( k \) is not \( 61 \).

## 4: Specific error analysis for each option
A) A student might choose A if they see the multiplication by 4 in Step \( 1 \) is correct but do not check the validity of Step \( 2 \) or recognize it as incorrect.
B) Choosing B would indicate a student believes \( 61 = k \) is correct without properly checking the steps, which seems unlikely given the straightforward nature of the error in Step \( 2 \).
C) A student choosing C would not have properly solved the equation or checked the steps for errors, indicating a lack of understanding.
D) Choosing D would indicate a student recognizes both steps cannot be correct given the known solution for \( k \) is \( 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 5: Predictions based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not fully understand the steps or how to verify them.
  - A: 20% (some recognition of Step 1)
  - B: 10% (misconception about Step 2)
  - C: 30% (lack of understanding of algebraic steps)
  - D: 40% (general recognition of incorrectness)

- **Basic**: These students have a foundational understanding but might make simple errors.
  - A: 15% (recognize Step 1 but not critically evaluate Step 2)
  - B: 5% (unlikely to think Step 2 is correct alone)
  - C: 20% (some might think both are correct due to lack of checking)
  - D: 60% (most recognize the error in Step 2)

- **Proficient**: These students understand algebra well and can identify errors.
  - A: 5% (unlikely, as they should see Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is not)
  - B: 2% (very unlikely)
  - C: 5% (should recognize the error)
  - D: 88% (should recognize both steps' validity)

- **Advanced**: These students have a deep understanding and can apply critical thinking.
  - A: 2% (very unlikely)
  - B: 1% (extremely unlikely)
  - C: 2% (should easily identify errors)
  - D: 95% (clearly see the correct assessment)

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might choose A if they see the multiplication by 4 in Step 1 is correct but do not check the validity of Step 2 or recognize it as incorrect.
B) Choosing B would indicate a student believes 61 = k is correct without properly checking the steps, which seems unlikely given the straightforward nature of the error in Step 2.
C) A student choosing C would not have properly solved the equation or checked the steps for errors, indicating a lack of understanding.
D) Choosing D would indicate a student recognizes both steps cannot be correct given the known solution for k is 59, not 61.
