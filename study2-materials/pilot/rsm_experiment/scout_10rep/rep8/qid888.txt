## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\).

## 2: Correct solution
To multiply out the brackets, we apply the FOIL method: First, Outer, Inner, Last. This means we multiply the first terms in each bracket, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, and finally the last terms in each bracket, and then add them all together.
\[
(m-5)(m-7) = m \cdot m + m \cdot (-7) - 5 \cdot m - 5 \cdot (-7)
\]
\[
= m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35
\]
\[
= m^2 - 12m + 35
\]
So, the correct answer is B) \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 3: Error Analysis for A) \(m^2 - 2m - 35\)
A student choosing A might have mistakenly applied the FOIL method incorrectly, possibly doing:
\[
m \cdot m - 5 \cdot (-7) - 7m - 5m
\]
or simply not adding the terms correctly, leading to an incorrect combination of terms.

## 4: Error Analysis for C) \(m^2 + 12m + 35\)
Choosing C suggests a student incorrectly added the middle terms, possibly getting:
\[
m^2 + 7m + 5m + 35 = m^2 + 12m + 35
\]
This indicates a mistake in handling the negative signs.

## 5: Error Analysis for D) \(m^2 - 12m - 35\)
For D, a student might have forgotten to change the sign when multiplying \(-5\) by \(-7\), getting:
\[
m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35
\]
or made another error in combining the terms.

## 6: Error Analysis Details
A) The error here could be from not properly applying the distributive property or making a calculation mistake, such as:
\[
m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35 \text{, then incorrectly written as } m^2 - 2m - 35.
\]
However, it seems more likely A results from incorrect calculations altogether.

B) Already identified as the correct answer.

C) This error comes from misinterpreting the signs when multiplying the terms.

D) This could result from incorrect handling of the multiplication of the constant terms.

## 7: Predicted Response Distribution
Given typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: These students struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They are likely to make significant errors.
    - A: 20% (incorrect calculation)
    - B: 10% (could understand the basic concept but not execute well)
    - C: 25% (confusing operations with positive outcomes)
    - D: 45% (another incorrect approach)

- **Basic**: Students here understand basic algebra but may make calculation errors.
    - A: 10%
    - B: 60% (grasp of FOIL but error in execution is less)
    - C: 15%
    - D: 15%

- **Proficient**: These students are more familiar with FOIL and less prone to errors.
    - A: 5%
    - B: 80%
    - C: 10%
    - D: 5%

- **Advanced**: Students performing at an advanced level should excel in such tasks with hardly any errors.
    - A: 2%
    - B: 95%
    - C: 2%
    - D: 1%

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might incorrectly calculate the terms, possibly misinterpreting the FOIL method or making an algebraic mistake.
B) Correct application of FOIL method.
C) Misinterpretation of the signs during multiplication.
D) Incorrect handling of the constant term multiplication.
