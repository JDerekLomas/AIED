## Step 1: Understanding the Problems
First, let's analyze the problems given:
- Problem P: \( 4 - 5 + 6 = \)
- Problem Q: \( 4 + 5 \times 6 = \)

In Problem P, according to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we should perform the operations from left to right since they are all addition and subtraction: \( 4 - 5 + 6 \). So, the correct first calculation is \( 4 - 5 \).

In Problem Q, following the order of operations, we should perform the multiplication before addition: \( 5 \times 6 \) should be calculated first.

## 2: Error Analysis
Let's analyze the possible errors for each wrong answer:

A) Problem P: \( 4 - 5 \), Problem Q: \( 4 + 5 \)
- This option correctly identifies the first operation for Problem P but incorrectly suggests adding \( 4 + 5 \) first in Problem Q, which is a misunderstanding of the order of operations.

B) Problem P: \( 4 - 5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \)
- This option correctly identifies the first operation for both problems, aligning with the order of operations.

C) Problem P: \( 5 + 6 \), Problem Q: \( 4 + 5 \)
- This suggests adding \( 5 + 6 \) first in Problem P, which is incorrect because addition and subtraction are performed from left to right. For Problem Q, it suggests adding \( 4 + 5 \) first, which is also incorrect.

D) Problem P: \( 5 + 6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \)
- This option incorrectly suggests adding \( 5 + 6 \) first in Problem P but correctly identifies the first operation for Problem Q.

## 3: Specific Errors
A) A student choosing A might misunderstand the order of operations in Problem Q, thinking addition and multiplication have equal precedence and can be done in any order.

B) There is no error here as B correctly states the operations to be done first.

C) A student choosing C might not understand that operations are performed from left to right in Problem P and mistakenly applies incorrect precedence in both problems.

D) A student choosing D likely understands the order of operations correctly for Problem Q but fails to apply left-to-right for Problem P.

## 4: Predictions
To make predictions, let's consider the understanding of mathematical operations by students at different levels:

- **Below Basic**: These students may not fully understand the order of operations. 
    - A: May choose due to partial understanding but misapplication (20%)
    - B: Correct understanding, so low percentage (5%)
    - C: Misunderstanding of both operations (40%)
    - D: Some understanding but mix-up (35%)

- **Basic**: Students have a basic grasp but might still make simple mistakes.
    - A: (10%)
    - B: (60%) because they understand the basics of order of operations.
    - C: (20%)
    - D: (10%)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations well.
    - A: (5%)
    - B: (80%)
    - C: (5%)
    - D: (10%)

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand but can apply the order of operations in complex situations.
    - A: (0%)
    - B: (90%)
    - C: (0%)
    - D: (10%)

The best answer is B.
