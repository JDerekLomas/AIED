## Step 1: Understand the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

## 2: Derive the formula for the radius of a sphere
To find the radius \(r\) in terms of \(V\), we rearrange the formula:
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
\[r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\]
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]

## 3: Analyze the error for option A
Option A is \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}}\). A student might choose this by incorrectly rearranging the volume formula, possibly mixing up the terms or misplacing \(\pi\), leading to an incorrect formulation.

## 4: Analyze the error for option B
Option B is \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}}\). This could result from a student forgetting to include \(\pi\) in the denominator when rearranging the formula, or incorrectly handling the \(\pi\) term.

## 5: Analyze the error for option C
Option C is \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}}\). This is actually the correct formula for the radius of a sphere given its volume, as derived in step 2.

## 6: Analyze the error for option D
Option D is \(\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi}\). A student might arrive at this by incorrectly applying operations to the terms, possibly misinterpreting how to isolate \(r\) or mistakenly introducing a linear term outside the cube root.

## 7: Predict the response distribution
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the formula or how to manipulate it. They could randomly select an option or choose based on superficial similarities to the correct formula. The distribution might be fairly spread out due to guesswork or a lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might struggle with algebraic manipulations. They could make simple errors like misplacing \(\pi\) or incorrectly handling coefficients.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand the formula and can manipulate it but might make careless mistakes or not fully check their work.
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to understand the formula and its derivation well, choosing the correct option or recognizing obvious errors in other options.

## 8: Estimating percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (misinterpreting the formula), B=20% (similar error), C=30% (chance of getting it right or very familiar with basic formulas), D=30% (random or incorrect manipulations).
- **Basic**: A=15% (careless mistake with \(\pi\)), B=25% (forgetting \(\pi\)), C=50% (correct or simple algebraic understanding), D=10% (elaborate incorrect manipulation).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (unlikely but could happen with distractors), B=10% (easily recognisable error), C=80% (understands and correctly applies the formula), D=5% (likely to catch simple algebraic errors).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (recognises the mistake), B=0% (aware of correct positioning of \(\pi\)), C=95% (strong understanding of algebraic manipulation), D=5% (either very difficult mistake to make or simply a slip).

The final answer is: 

Error Analysis:
A) A student might choose this by incorrectly rearranging the volume formula, possibly mixing up the terms or misplacing \(\pi\).
B) A student might choose this by forgetting to include \(\pi\) in the denominator when rearranging the formula.
C) This is the correct formula for the radius of a sphere given its volume.
D) A student might arrive at this by incorrectly applying operations to the terms, possibly misinterpreting how to isolate \(r\).
