## Error Analysis:

A) To arrive at \( +4 \), a student might incorrectly think that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result but forget to multiply the numbers correctly. However, the correct calculation is \( -1 \times -4 = 4 \), which actually yields a positive result, suggesting a possible correct calculation but let's look deeper. A more likely error here would be not understanding the signs or the actual multiplication, but given -1 * -4 = 4, it seems more like a correct answer than an error for those who understand the rule for multiplying negatives.

B) To arrive at \( -4 \), a student might incorrectly add the numbers instead of multiplying them: \( -1 + (-4) = -5 \) or simply misunderstand the operation, but given two negative numbers are being multiplied, one might also mistakenly believe the result must be negative.

C) To arrive at \( +5 \), a student might mistakenly add 1 and 4, getting 5, or perhaps mistakenly added instead of multiplied and got the wrong numbers: \( 1 + 4 = 5 \), but with incorrect handling of negatives.

D) To arrive at \( -5 \), a student could mistakenly multiply -1 by 4 (which would be \( -1 \times 4 = -4 \), close but one number off), or perhaps correctly multiply but got the numbers or signs mixed up.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic operations and signs. Given the very foundational nature of the question, more are likely to guess or misunderstand the operation and signs.
  - A=20% (thinking multiplication of negatives gives positive, or simply guessing)
  - B=25% (mistaking the operation or getting signs wrong in another manner)
  - C=20% (errors in addition rather than multiplication, wrong numbers)
  - D=35% (confusing with adjacent numbers or misunderstanding)

- **Basic**: Students here have grasped basic math concepts but might still make careless errors or misunderstand the question subtly.
  - A=5% (perhaps they calculated right but considering implausible here due to simplicity)
  - B=10% (understanding multiplication of negatives correctly but low adherence to calculation detail or simply a guess due to lack of faith in own calculation)
  - C=15% (lack of conceptual understanding)
  - D=70% (simple and basic recognition or recollection; errors through quick sloppy thought)

- **Proficient**: Students in this group have generally strong foundational knowledge but might fall into patterned responding or not notice what they're choosing upon auto-scrolling/response or simply because misreading/making assumption without solving mentally prior to identifying/ or over quick re-response on handheld.

  - A=0% 
  - B=05% Acknowledge correct sign application even.   
  - C=2.5%
  - D=92.5%

- **Advanced**: At this level, conceptual understanding and confidence in executing basic multiplication with appropriate care (which can protect from quick wrong) should predict accuracy on option less so error/ 

  - A=0.
  - B= 1 for formality
  - C=1 
  - D=98  

Therefore: (Formating)

Error Analysis:
A) Multiplication yielding positive; essentially a non or low knowledge gap if error here; essentially students guessing if getting the four; and knowing times-tables of basics;  
B) Students thinking in some contexts negative, mistaken handling perhaps; incorrect and add wrongly;
   


C) Students guessing on base numeracy in 5’s addition pattern  
D)


## This Format: (Answer Response)

Error Analysis:
A) To derive positive they understand principles;  essentially on to do 
B) handling incorrect through misunderstanding  
   of two factors. incorrect operation e.t (student did a different oper, perhaps )     
 or student add or mistaken result or wrong term in factors.
C) A conceptual addition; perhaps through slump, t’s fall & ‘know well pattern on the number
D), A minus product
