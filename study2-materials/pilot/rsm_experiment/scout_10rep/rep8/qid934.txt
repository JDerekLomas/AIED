## Step 1: Understand the equation and the task
The given equation is \(4x + 2y = 10\), and we need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\). This involves substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation and solving for \(y\).

## 2: Solve the equation for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\), we get:
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[0 + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]
\[y = 5\]

## 3: Analyze the errors leading to each wrong answer
A) \(20\): A student might choose \(20\) if they incorrectly solved the equation or substituted \(x = 0\) and \(y = 10\) directly into a rearranged form without solving for \(y\), or made a calculation mistake such as \(4*0 + 2y = 10\) leading to \(2y = 10*4 = 40\), thus \(y = 20\).

B) \(3\): Choosing \(3\) could result from a calculation error where the student solved for \(y\) but made a mistake, such as \(2y = 10 - 4*0 = 6\), so \(y = 3\).

C) \(5\): This is the correct answer. A student who correctly substitutes \(x = 0\) into the equation and solves for \(y\) will get \(y = 5\).

D) \(2.5\): A student might get \(2.5\) if they incorrectly solved the equation, possibly by dividing incorrectly or misinterpreting the equation, such as \(4*0 + 2y = 10\) leading to \(2y = 5\), hence \(y = 2.5\).

## 4: Error Analysis
A) To choose \(A\), a student would mistakenly calculate \(y\) as \(20\), possibly by incorrectly multiplying or misunderstanding the equation's structure.
B) For \(B\), a student might mistakenly find \(y = 3\) by miscalculating \(2y = 6\), yielding \(y = 3\).
C) For \(C\), the correct calculation yields \(y = 5\).
D) For \(D\), a student might mistakenly divide \(10\) by \(4\) or misinterpret the calculation, getting \(y = 2.5\).

## 5: Predict the response distribution
Given typical student performance:
- Below basic: These students often lack fundamental understanding. They might randomly guess or make significant calculation errors.
- Basic: Students at this level have some understanding but are prone to making errors.
- Proficient: These students generally understand the concepts but may make occasional mistakes.
- Advanced: These students have a strong grasp of the concepts and rarely make mistakes.

## 6: Assign percentages based on understanding
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (completely off), B=20% (some arithmetic mistake), C=30% (correct by chance or basic understanding), D=20% (another mistake)
- **Basic**: A=10% (significant mistake), B=15% (common arithmetic error), C=60% (understands basic substitution), D=15% (miscalculation)
- **Proficient**: A=5% (unlikely significant error), B=5% (minor arithmetic mistake), C=85% (correctly solves), D=5% (slight miscalculation)
- **Advanced**: A=0% (no significant errors), B=0% (no mistakes), C=95% (accurately solves), D=5% (rare, slight error)

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student would need to incorrectly calculate \(y = 20\), possibly from \(2y = 40\), a mistaken expansion or substitution.
B) A student might calculate \(2y = 6\), getting \(y = 3\).
C) Correct calculation yields \(y = 5\).
D) A student could find \(y = 2.5\) from misdividing or a similar error.

Predictions:

basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
