## Step 1: Analyze the given equation and Isaac's steps
The given equation is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \( k \), we first multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction, which yields \( 60 = 1 + k \). Then, we subtract 1 from both sides to solve for \( k \), resulting in \( k = 59 \).

## 2: Evaluate Isaac's steps
Isaac's Step 1: \( 60 = 1 + k \) is correct because multiplying both sides of the original equation by 4 gives \( 60 = 1 + k \).
Isaac's Step 2: \( 61 = k \) is incorrect because subtracting 1 from both sides of \( 60 = 1 + k \) yields \( k = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 3: Identify the errors leading to each wrong answer
A) Only step 1: A student might choose this if they see Step 1 as correct but do not evaluate the correctness of Step 2 or realize that Step 2 is incorrect.
B) Only step 2: This would be chosen by a student who incorrectly believes Step 2 is correct and either does not notice or incorrectly assesses the correctness of Step 1.
C) Both steps are correct: A student choosing this would incorrectly believe that both steps are right, meaning they do not understand the error in Step 2.
D) Both steps are incorrect: A student who recognizes that Step 1 is actually correct but Step 2 is incorrect might still choose this if they mistakenly think there's an error in Step 1.

## 4: Error Analysis
A) A student chooses A if they acknowledge the correctness of Step 1 but mistakenly do not evaluate or misjudge the error in Step 2.
B) A student chooses B if they mistakenly think Step 2 is correct and ignore or misjudge the correctness of Step 1.
C) A student chooses C if they do not identify the error in Step 2, thus believing both steps are correct.
D) A student chooses D if they incorrectly think Step 1 is wrong, possibly due to miscalculation or misunderstanding of the algebraic process.

## 5: Predictions
- **below_basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulations. They might choose B (20%) because they see a number operation and think it's correct without checking, A (30%) because they see Step 1 as obviously correct, D (30%) because they generally struggle with equations, and C (20%) if they naively trust Isaac's steps.
- **basic**: At this level, students have a grasp of basic algebra but might make simple mistakes. They could choose A (40%) because they see Step 1 is correct, B (20%) due to trusting Step 2, C (10%) if they mistakenly think both are right, and D (30%) if they correctly spot Step 2's error but misunderstand Step 1's correctness.
- **proficient**: Proficient students understand algebra but can still make oversights. They might choose A (50%) because they know Step 1 is correct and are focused on its accuracy, B (10%) if they errantly trust Step 2, C (5%) if they mistakenly validate both steps, and D (35%) if they catch the mistake in Step 2.
- **advanced**: Advanced students are likely to correctly evaluate both steps. They might choose A (10%) due to quickly verifying Step 1 without a second thought, B (5%) if they see the simple arithmetic mistake, D (20%) due to strict evaluation, and C (65%) because they recognize both steps' validity or errors accurately.

The final answer is: 

Error Analysis:
A) A student chooses A if they see Step 1 as correct but do not properly evaluate Step 2.
B) A student chooses B if they mistakenly think Step 2 is correct and ignore or misjudge Step 1.
C) A student chooses C if they do not identify the error in Step 2.
D) A student chooses D if they incorrectly assess the correctness of one or both steps.

Predictions:
