## Step 1: Convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions for easier calculation
To solve \( 2 \frac{7}{10}+2 \frac{1}{4} \), first convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions. \( 2 \frac{7}{10} = \frac{(2*10) + 7}{10} = \frac{20 + 7}{10} = \frac{27}{10} \) and \( 2 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{(2*4) + 1}{4} = \frac{8 + 1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \).

## 2: Find a common denominator for the improper fractions
The common denominator for 10 and 4 is 20. Convert both fractions: \( \frac{27}{10} = \frac{27*2}{10*2} = \frac{54}{20} \) and \( \frac{9}{4} = \frac{9*5}{4*5} = \frac{45}{20} \).

## 3: Add the fractions
Add the fractions with the common denominator: \( \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} \).

## 4: Convert the sum back to a mixed number
Convert \( \frac{99}{20} \) to a mixed number: \( \frac{99}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20} \).

## 5: Analyze each wrong answer
A) \( \frac{99}{20} \): This is the improper fraction result of the addition. A student might choose this if they forgot to convert the result back to a mixed number or were asked to leave it in this form but didn't.

B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \): This is the correct answer. No error.

C) \( \frac{99}{40} \): This would result from adding \( \frac{27}{10} \) and \( \frac{9}{4} \) with a common denominator of 40 instead of 20, leading to \( \frac{27*4}{10*4} + \frac{9*10}{4*10} = \frac{108}{40} + \frac{90}{40} = \frac{198}{40} = \frac{99}{20} \), indicating a miscalculation in finding the common denominator or adding.

D) \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \): This seems to come from a completely different calculation or incorrect conversion. It could result from mistakenly finding a common denominator and adding fractions incorrectly or converting fractions to mixed numbers improperly.

## 6: Specific errors for each wrong answer
A) A student who chooses A might simply not convert their answer to a mixed number or was satisfied with the improper fraction result.

B) There's no error here as it's the correct answer.

C) A student choosing C might have used a common denominator of 40 instead of 20 (e.g., \( \frac{27}{10} = \frac{108}{40} \) and \( \frac{9}{4} = \frac{90}{40} \), adding to \( \frac{198}{40} \) which simplifies to \( \frac{99}{20} \), indicating an error in execution).

D) For D, \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \), the error could be in adding the fractions and then converting; possibly the student added the whole numbers (2+2=4) and then incorrectly added \( \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} \) to get \( \frac{7*2}{10*2} + \frac{1*5}{4*5} = \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20} \), but then improperly simplified or converted.
