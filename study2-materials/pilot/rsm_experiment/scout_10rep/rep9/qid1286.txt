## Step 1: Understanding the Volume Formula of a Sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere. To find the radius \(r\) in terms of \(V\), we need to rearrange this formula.

## 2: Deriving the Formula for Radius
Starting with \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), to solve for \(r\), we first multiply both sides by \(\frac{3}{4\pi}\) to get \(\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3\). Then, taking the cube root of both sides gives \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\).

## 3: Error Analysis for Each Option
A) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \): This option incorrectly places \(\pi\) in the numerator and swaps the positions of \(4\) and \(3\) compared to the correct derivation. A student might choose this by mistakenly trying to solve for \(r\) but incorrectly handling the constants and \(\pi\).

B) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \): This option is close but incorrectly places \(\pi\) in the denominator. A student might choose this by correctly starting the derivation but then misplacing \(\pi\).

C) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \): This is the correct formula for the radius of a sphere given its volume. It correctly rearranges the volume formula to solve for \(r\).

D) \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \): This option suggests a misunderstanding of how to handle the cube root and the constants. It implies taking the cube root of \(V\) separately and then applying the rest of the formula incorrectly.

## 4: Predicting Response Distribution
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not even attempt the question or make significant errors. They are likely to choose A or D due to a lack of understanding of the formula and how to rearrange it (A=30%, B=10%, C=20%, D=40%).

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might struggle with rearranging formulas. They might choose A or B due to minor errors in rearranging the formula (A=20%, B=25%, C=40%, D=15%).

- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand the concepts and can rearrange formulas but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to choose B or A less frequently, with most opting for C (A=10%, B=10%, C=75%, D=5%).

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong understanding and are less likely to make errors. They will mostly choose C, with very few choosing incorrect options (A=2%, B=2%, C=95%, D=1%).

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might choose this by mistakenly trying to solve for \(r\) but incorrectly handling the constants and \(\pi\).
B) A student might choose this by correctly starting the derivation but then misplacing \(\pi\).
C) This is the correct formula for the radius of a sphere given its volume.
D) This option suggests a misunderstanding of how to handle the cube root and the constants.
