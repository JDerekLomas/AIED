## Error Analysis:

A) To choose answer A) \( +4 \), a student might incorrectly multiply -1 and -4, but then forget to consider the sign of the product or mistakenly think that multiplying two negatives gives a positive, which is correct, but then incorrectly calculate or recall the product as 4 instead of 4, which actually results from correctly multiplying -1 * -4 = 4.

B) For answer B) \( -4 \), a student might incorrectly think that multiplying two negatives gives a negative, which is an error because multiplying two negative numbers actually yields a positive.

C) To choose answer C) \( +5 \), a student could make a calculation error, thinking the product of -1 and -4 equals 5 instead of 4, perhaps due to a simple arithmetic mistake.

D) For answer D) \( -5 \), a student might think that the product of a negative and a negative is negative, which is incorrect. This results from misunderstanding the rule for multiplying negative numbers.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students may not fully grasp the rules for multiplying negative numbers or basic arithmetic. 
  - A=20% (simple mistake, adding 1)
  - B=30% (incorrectly applying sign rules)
  - C=20% (arithmetical mistake)
  - D=30% (misapplication of rules)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make careless errors.
  - A=10% (miscalculation or confusion)
  - B=20% (misunderstanding of negative multiplication)
  - C=15% (arithmetical mistake)
  - D=55% (mostly understands but minor errors)

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts but may rush or misread questions.
  - A=5% (mostly calculation or reading error)
  - B=10% (occasional misunderstanding)
  - C=5% (arithmetical slip)
  - D=80% (accurately apply rules)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly accurate and understand the concepts deeply.
  - A=0% (rarely mistaken)
  - B=0% (understand multiplication of negatives)
  - C=0% (accurate calculation)
  - D=100% (know -1 * -4 = 4)
