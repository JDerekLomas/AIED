## Step 1: Understanding the given equation and the task
The equation given is \(10x - 6y = 30\), and we need to find the value of \(x\) when \(y = 0.5\).

## 2: Substituting \(y = 0.5\) into the equation
To find \(x\), substitute \(y = 0.5\) into the equation:
\[10x - 6(0.5) = 30\]

## 3: Solving for \(x\)
Solving for \(x\):
\[10x - 3 = 30\]
\[10x = 30 + 3\]
\[10x = 33\]
\[x = \frac{33}{10}\]
\[x = 3.3\]

## 4: Error Analysis for each wrong answer
A) \(4.25\): This could result from incorrect substitution or calculation, such as \(10x - 6(0.5) = 10x - 3 = 30\), then \(10x = 30 + 6(0.5) = 30 + 3 = 33\), but mistakenly solving it as \(10x = 42.5\) (wrongly adding 9.5 instead of 3 to 30), which is not a straightforward mistake from the correct calculation.

B) \(-4.25\): This might arise from a mistake like \(10x = 30 - 6(0.5)\), leading to \(10x = 30 - 3 = 27\), then \(x = 2.7\), but a sign error could give a negative value. Alternatively, a miscalculation: \(10x - 6y = 30\), \(10x - 6(0.5) = 30\), \(10x = 30 + 3\), \(10x = 33\), but if one mistakenly calculates or uses a wrong formula, \(x\) could become negative.

C) \(3.3\): This is actually the correct answer.

D) \(2.7\): A simple miscalculation could lead to this, such as dividing 27 by 10 instead of 33 by 10.

## 5: Detailed Error for Each Option
A) To get \(4.25\), one might do \(x = (30 + 6) / 10 = 36 / 10 = 3.6\), then mistakenly round or miscalculate further.

B) For \(-4.25\), let's correct and assume: If a student thought \(-6y\) was \(+6y\), \(10x + 3 = 30\), \(10x = 27\), \(x = 2.7\). Sign errors or wrong operations could give \(-4.25\), such as mistaken use of \(y = -0.5\), \(10x = 30 - 6(-0.5)\) or incorrect distribution of negative signs.

C) Correct calculation: \(x = 3.3\).

D) \(2.7\) could come from \(10x - 6*0.5 = 30\) leading to \(10x = 30 + 3 = 33\), but with incorrect further steps: assuming someone solves to get \(10x - 3 = 27\), \(x = 2.7\).

## 6: Specific Calculation Errors Leading to Wrong Answers
- A: Wrongly manipulating the equation, extra addition.
- B: Using a wrong \(y\) value or manipulating the signs wrongly.
- C: Correct answer from right calculations.
- D: Underestimating or wrong algebraic manipulation.
