## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question asks students to add two mixed numbers: \( 2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5} \) and to leave their answer as a mixed number.

## 2: Converting mixed numbers to improper fractions for easier addition
To add these mixed numbers, it's helpful to first convert them into improper fractions. \( 2 \frac{1}{5} = \frac{(2*5) + 1}{5} = \frac{10 + 1}{5} = \frac{11}{5} \) and \( 1 \frac{2}{5} = \frac{(1*5) + 2}{5} = \frac{5 + 2}{5} = \frac{7}{5} \).

## 3: Adding the improper fractions
Adding these improper fractions: \( \frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{11 + 7}{5} = \frac{18}{5} \).

## 4: Converting the improper fraction back to a mixed number
To convert \( \frac{18}{5} \) back to a mixed number: \( \frac{18}{5} = 3 \frac{3}{5} \) because \( 18 \div 5 = 3 \) remainder \( 3 \), so \( \frac{18}{5} = 3 + \frac{3}{5} = 3 \frac{3}{5} \).

## 5: Error Analysis
A) \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \): This is the correct answer. No error.
B) \( \frac{18}{5} \): A student might choose this if they forgot to convert the improper fraction back into a mixed number or were instructed to leave the answer in a different form but understood the calculation.
C) \( \frac{18}{10} \): This could happen if a student incorrectly converted \( \frac{18}{5} \) to have a denominator of 10, possibly thinking to make the fractions easier to add or compare, but did not simplify or convert properly.
D) \( 3 \frac{3}{10} \): A student might arrive at this answer by incorrectly adding the fractions \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{10} \) instead of \( \frac{3}{5} \), then adding 3.

## 6: Specific Errors
A) No error, correct answer.
B) Failure to convert improper fraction to mixed number.
C) Incorrectly converting \( \frac{18}{5} \) to \( \frac{18}{10} \), possibly by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 2.
D) Incorrect addition of fractions, \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{10} \) instead of \( \frac{3}{5} \).

## 7: Predictions
- **Below Basic**: Students may struggle with converting mixed numbers to improper fractions and back. They might not understand fraction addition, leading to random or incorrect choices.
  - A=20% (luck), B=30% (improper fraction), C=20% (incorrect conversion), D=30% (incorrect fraction addition).
- **Basic**: Students understand basic operations but may make calculation mistakes.
  - A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Students can perform operations accurately but might overlook instructions.
  - A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students understand the material well and can apply it.
  - A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) This is the correct answer. No error.
B) Failure to convert improper fraction to mixed number.
C) Incorrectly converting \( \frac{18}{5} \) to \( \frac{18}{10} \).
