## Error Analysis:

A) To arrive at answer A (6), a student would likely perform the operations in the wrong order and ignore the rules of BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). They might calculate: \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 = 3 - 5 + 8 = 3 - 13 = -10\) is incorrect for A, a more likely mistake is \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \( -2 + 4 = 2\), and \(2 \times 2 = 4\) or simply adding/subtracting incorrectly: \(3 - 5 + 8 = 6\).

B) For answer B (4), a student might follow a partially correct order of operations but still make significant mistakes: \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(4 \times 2 = 8\), and \(-2 + 8 = 6\) is not B, so likely they just made an arithmetic mistake or wrong order: \(5 + 4 = 9\), \(9 \times 2 = 18\), then \(3 - 18 = -15\) is not B. They likely thought \(4 \times 2 = 8\), \(3 + 8 = 11\), and \(11 - 5 = 6\) is not B. A likely scenario is misinterpreting the operational sequence as \( (3 - 5) + (4 \times 2) = -2 + 8 = 6 \) which does not fit. Simply they might compute: \(4 \times 2 = 8\), \(8 + 3 = 11\) and \(11 - 5 = 6\), which still doesn't fit. 

C) For answer C (-12), a student might incorrectly apply operations in an order that deliberately or mistakenly disregards conventional rules, performing operations from left to right but making calculation errors: \(3 - 5 = -2\), \(-2 + 4 = 2\), and then \(2 \times 2 = 4\). If done in another incorrect sequence, like multiplying first without distributing or simply multiplying  all then subtract, no clear logic brings one here directly w/o invoking lack of knowledge on priority clearly .

D) For answer D (-10), a plausible error might be misunderstanding the order thoroughly or right calculation wrong sequence.

Direct evaluation yields 

The best practice leads : order \(4\times 2= 8; then,\ 3 -5 = -2 then; -2 +8\) simplified
