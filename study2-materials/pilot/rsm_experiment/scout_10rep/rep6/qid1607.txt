## Step 1: Analyzing the given equation and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \( k \), we first multiply both sides by 4 to get \( 60 = 1 + k \). Then, we subtract 1 from both sides to get \( 59 = k \). Isaac's steps are: Step \( 1: 60=1+k \) and Step \( 2: 61=k \).

## 2: Identifying errors in Isaac's steps
Isaac's Step 1 is correct because multiplying both sides of the equation \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \) by 4 indeed yields \( 60 = 1 + k \). However, his Step 2 is incorrect because he writes \( 61 = k \) instead of \( 59 = k \) (since \( 60 - 1 = 59 \), not 61).

## 3: Error Analysis for each option
A) Only step \( 1 \) is correct: This would be chosen by a student who recognizes that Step 1 is correct but does not verify the correctness of Step 2 or realizes Step 2 is incorrect.
B) Only step \( 2 \) is correct: This option would be selected by a student who incorrectly verifies the steps and believes Step 2 is correct in isolation, likely due to not checking Step 1 or misunderstanding the equation.
C) Both steps are correct: A student choosing this option does not understand the basic algebraic manipulation required to solve the equation and incorrectly verifies both steps as correct.
D) Both steps are incorrect: This would be chosen by a student who recognizes that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect, understanding that if Step 1 is right, then Step 2 cannot be correct given the mistake identified.

## 4: Correcting the Error Analysis based on accurate understanding
- A) A student might choose this if they see Step 1 as correct but do not follow through to see the mistake in Step 2 or believe Step 2's error doesn't invalidate Step 1.
- B) Choosing this would indicate a student thinks Step 2 is somehow correct without properly evaluating Step 1.
- C) Selecting this would mean a student incorrectly validates both steps without recognizing the algebraic error.
- D) Picking this would reflect an understanding that given one step is correct (Step 1), and the other is wrong (Step 2), both cannot be considered correct.

## 5: Predictions
Given the UK maths teaching context:
- **Below_basic**: Students might struggle with basic algebra. They could randomly select or choose based on incomplete understanding. \( A=20\% \) (some see Step 1 as a possible correct step), \( B=15\% \) (isolated incorrect validation), \( C=10\% \) (incorrect validation of both), \( D=55\% \) (recognizing an issue).
- **Basic**: These students have a foundation but may make simple mistakes. \( A=30\% \) (correctly identifying Step 1), \( B=10\% \) (focusing on Step 2's error without evaluating Step 1 fully), \( C=5\% \) (rarely would they validate both incorrectly), \( D=55\% \) (correct identification of errors).
- **Proficient**: Students should accurately solve and evaluate steps. \( A=40\% \) (validate Step 1, not Step 2), \( B=5\% \) (unlikely to focus solely on Step 2), \( C=5\% \) (unlikely to validate both as correct), \( D=50\% \) (accurately identify one step correct, one incorrect).
- **Advanced**: These students thoroughly understand algebraic manipulations. \( A=5\% \) (aware but test-taking strategy), \( B=0\% \) (unlikely), \( C=0\% \) (understand the mistake), \( D=95\% \) (identifying the accurate status of each step).

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student sees Step 1 as correct but does not validate Step 2 properly.
B) A student incorrectly believes Step 2 is correct in isolation.
C) A student incorrectly validates both steps as correct.
D) A student recognizes both steps are not simultaneously correct.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=30% B=10% C=5% D=55%
proficient: A=40% B=5% C=5% D=50%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
