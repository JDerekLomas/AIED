## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the task
The equation given is \(y = 3x^2\), and we need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0.3\).

## 2: Calculate the correct value of \(y\)
To find \(y\), we substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation: \(y = 3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\).

## 3: Analyze the error for each wrong answer
A) \(0.81\): This would be the result of \(3 \times (0.3)^3 = 3 \times 0.027 = 0.081\), or possibly a misunderstanding of the exponentiation, but more likely it comes from incorrectly calculating \((0.3)^2\) as \(0.9\) and then \(3 \times 0.9 = 2.7\), which does not match. However, a plausible mistake is \((0.3)^2 = 0.09\) but mistakenly multiplying by 9 (incorrect expansion or calculation), yielding \(3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\), which actually matches another option. A potential mistake could be \(0.3^2 = 0.09\) but then mistakenly using \(3 \times 0.9\) (considering \(0.9\) as a possible squared value misinterpretation) does not apply directly here but \(0.3*0.3=0.09\) and assuming an incorrect operation.

B) \(0.27\): This is actually the correct answer, so let's consider how someone might mistakenly not choose this.

C) \(1.8\): This could come from a miscalculation such as: \(0.3^2 = 3 \times 6 = 18\), but properly it's \(0.09\), so then possibly taking \(3 \times 0.6 = 1.8\) or similar conceptual gap. Likely, this mistake comes from incorrect quadratic calculation \(0.3*0.3=0.09\), maybe some incorrectly assumed conversion.

D) \(2.7\): A likely mistake is to calculate \(3 \times 0.3 = 0.9\) then assuming some form of squaring, likely to simply misapply or think directly to results; here plausibly related think error to confusion between \(x\) or its square with an assumed numeric manipulation, \(y= 3*0.9\) would yield 2.7 which shows someone calculated not applying the correct rule or mistaken \(0.9 = 0.3^2\) somehow concept.
