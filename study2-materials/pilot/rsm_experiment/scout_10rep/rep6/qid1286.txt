## Step 1: Understand the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

## 2: Derive the formula for the radius of a sphere
To find the radius \(r\) in terms of \(V\), we rearrange the formula:
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
\[r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\]
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]

## 3: Analyze each option for errors
A) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \): This option incorrectly swaps the positions of \(4\pi\) and \(3\), and also incorrectly includes \(\pi\) in the numerator.

B) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \): This option is missing the \(\pi\) in the denominator when solving for \(r\), incorrectly yielding \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}\).

C) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \): This is the correct formula for the radius of the sphere.

D) \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \): This option incorrectly applies the cube root and misplaces the constants, not following the correct algebraic manipulation of the volume formula.

## 4: Specific error analysis for each wrong answer
A) The error is swapping \(3\) and \(4\pi\) and misplacing \(\pi\), suggesting a confusion in algebraic manipulation.

B) The error is omitting \(\pi\) from the denominator, suggesting a mistake in recalling the formula.

C) No error, this is the correct answer.

D) The error is in incorrect distribution of operations and misunderstanding of how to isolate \(r\), indicating a significant algebraic mistake.

## 5: Predict the response distribution based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students might not recall the volume formula correctly or struggle with algebraic manipulations. They are more likely to choose incorrect options due to a lack of understanding.
  - A: 20% (incorrectly manipulates the formula)
  - B: 25% (forgets \(\pi\) or misplaces constants)
  - C: 30% (some recall the correct formula or derive it correctly)
  - D: 25% (makes significant algebraic errors)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may struggle with formula manipulation.
  - A: 15% (still confused about formula parts)
  - B: 20% (simple algebraic errors)
  - C: 50% (can derive or recall the formula correctly)
  - D: 15% (more complex errors)

- **Proficient**: These students are familiar with the formulas and can apply them correctly but might still make occasional mistakes.
  - A: 5% (occasional confusion)
  - B: 10% (minor algebraic slip)
  - C: 80% (accurately recall and apply the formula)
  - D: 5% (less common errors)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident in their mathematical abilities and less likely to make errors.
  - A: 2% (rare errors in formula recall)
  - B: 3% (very occasional algebraic mistake)
  - C: 90% (strong understanding and application)
  - D: 5% (highly unlikely but possible under stress)

## 6: Provide the response distribution in the required format
Error Analysis:
A) Incorrectly swaps the positions of \(4\pi\) and \(3\), and misplaces \(\pi\).
B) Omits \(\pi\) from the denominator or misplaces constants.
C) Correct formula.
D) Incorrectly applies cube root and misplaces constants.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
