## Error Analysis:

A) To arrive at \( +4 \), a student might incorrectly multiply \( -1 \) by \( -4 \) and forget that two negative numbers make a positive, but actually, they likely just forgot to apply the multiplication correctly or misinterpreted the signs. However, the correct calculation is \( -1 \times -4 = 4 \), which actually leads to the correct answer, not an error in this specific case. An error might involve misunderstanding the operation or the signs, but technically, \( -1 \times -4 = 4 \) is correct.

B) To arrive at \( -4 \), a student might mistakenly think that multiplying two negative numbers gives a negative result, which is incorrect. The correct result of \( -1 \times -4 \) is \( 4 \), not \( -4 \).

C) To arrive at \( +5 \), a student could have incorrectly calculated or remembered the multiplication table, or they might have added \( -1 \) and \( -4 \) instead of multiplying them.

D) To arrive at \( -5 \), similar to option B, a student might incorrectly apply the multiplication of negative numbers or simply make a calculation mistake.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with basic multiplication and handling of negative numbers. 
  - A=20% (confusing with correct due to not actually doing the calculation)
  - B=30% (applying incorrect rules for negatives)
  - C=20% (incorrectly adding or misinterpreting numbers)
  - D=30% (calculation mistakes or incorrect handling of negatives)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make careless mistakes.
  - A=5% (few would actually still not get the correct basic operation)
  - B=20% (mistaking the rule for multiplying negatives)
  - C=15% (miscalculation or missing the step of multiplication)
  - D=60% (most still retain some level of confusion with negative number operations)

- **Proficient:** At this level, students are more likely to understand the multiplication of negatives but can still make occasional errors.
  - A=0% (should recall basic multiplication facts correctly)
  - B=10% (some might question the rule but shouldn't commonly make this mistake)
  - C=5% (mistakes would likely be careless)
  - D=85% (bulk understand and apply the rule correctly but could mistakenly recall)

- **Advanced:** These students are expected to have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts.
  - A=0% 
  - B=0% (they would not make fundamental errors in handling negatives)
  - C=0% 
  - D=100% (confident and accurate multiplication by negatives)

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might consider the multiplication but then is misinformed about positive outcomes only  
B) Believing two negatives give a negative 
C) Incorrectly adding instead of multiplying 
D) The confusion seems likely in line with calculation

Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=15% D=60%
proficient: A=0% B=10% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
