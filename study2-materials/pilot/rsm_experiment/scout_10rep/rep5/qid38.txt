## Step 1: Error Analysis for Option A
To arrive at option A, \( \frac{11}{2 x} \), a student might add the numerators (3 + 4 = 7) but fail to find a common denominator or incorrectly apply the denominator. However, a more likely scenario is that they confuse the addition with multiplying the numerators and denominators separately or simply add the numerators without properly handling the denominators, leading to \( \frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \) if they mistakenly doubled the 4 (which is \( \frac{4}{x} = \frac{8}{2x} \)).

## 2: Error Analysis for Option B
For option B, \( \frac{7}{3 x} \), a student might add the numerators (3 + 4 = 7) and then incorrectly find a common denominator or assume the common denominator is \( 3x \) instead of \( 2x \), leading to \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \) but then mistakenly simplifies to \( \frac{7}{3x} \) due to a miscalculation of the common denominator. A simpler error could be adding a non-existent \( 2x \) and \( x \) in the denominator linearly.

## 3: Error Analysis for Option C
To choose option C, \( \frac{11}{x} \), a student adds the fractions \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \) correctly to get \( \frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \) and then tries to simplify but mistakenly cancels or forgets the 2 in the denominator, resulting in \( \frac{11}{x} \). This shows a misunderstanding of finding a common denominator and possibly misapplying simplification rules.

## 4: Error Analysis for Option D
Option D, \( \frac{7}{2 x} \), would arise if a student wrongly assumes \( \frac{4}{x} = \frac{4}{2x} \times 2 = \frac{8}{2x} \) and then adds \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \) but actually, a straightforward error could be simply adding \( 3 + 4 = 7 \) for the numerator without adjusting denominators, yielding \( \frac{3+4}{2x} = \frac{7}{2x} \).
