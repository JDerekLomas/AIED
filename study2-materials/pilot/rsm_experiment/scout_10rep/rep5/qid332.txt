## Error Analysis:

A) To choose option A, a student would incorrectly believe that only Tom's suggestion is valid and Katie's is incorrect, without evaluating Katie's suggestion properly.

B) For a student to choose option B, they would think Katie's suggestion is correct but Tom's is not, indicating a misunderstanding of Tom's proposal.

C) Choosing option C would imply that a student understands and can validate both Tom's and Katie's suggestions as correct next steps in solving the equation.

D) A student choosing option D would believe that neither Tom nor Katie provided a correct next line of working, showing a lack of understanding of how to isolate x in the given equation.

## Specific Errors:

- For A: A student might not fully understand the algebraic manipulations or might incorrectly assess Katie's suggestion.
- For B: The student might not properly evaluate Tom's suggestion or might incorrectly solve Katie's equation.
- For C: This is the correct answer; both Tom and Katie can be correct as their methods are algebraically sound.
- For D: A student might incorrectly apply algebraic rules or not see how either method leads to a solution.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** A=30% (simple acceptance of one method without evaluation), B=20% (similar to A, with confusion), C=10% (understanding is weak), D=40% (total confusion or incorrect application of rules).
- **Basic:** A=20% (starting to see the logic but biased), B=20% (sees one method's validity), C=40% (beginning to understand multiple approaches), D=20% (still confusion).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (strong understanding, unlikely to dismiss valid methods), B=5% (similar), C=80% (confident in algebraic manipulations), D=10% (minor misunderstandings).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (expects thorough understanding), B=0% (same), C=95% (experts see both as valid), D=5% (very rare misunderstanding).

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
