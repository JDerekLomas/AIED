## Step 1: Understanding the equation and task
The equation given is \(y = 3x^2\), and we need to find \(y\) when \(x = 0.3\). To do this, we substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation: \(y = 3(0.3)^2\).

## 2: Calculating the correct answer
Calculate \(y\): \(y = 3(0.3)^2 = 3(0.09) = 0.27\).

## 3: Analyzing errors for each wrong answer
A) \(0.81\): This would result from \(y = (0.3)^2 = 0.09\) and then mistakenly multiplying by 9 (or \(3^2\)), implying a confusion in applying the exponent and coefficient properly.

B) \(0.27\): This is the correct calculation, as shown in Step 2.

C) \(1.8\): This error might occur from \(y = 3 \times 0.3 = 0.9\) and then mistakenly doubling it or another incorrect operation.

D) \(2.7\): This could result from \(y = 3 \times 0.3 = 0.9\) and then multiplying by 3 again, or simply adding 3 and 0.3 then squaring or another miscalculation.

## 4: Specific error analysis
A) \(0.81\): A student might mistakenly calculate \(3(0.3)^2\) as \(3 * 0.3 * 0.3 * 3 = 0.81\) or confuse with \(0.9^2\).

B) No error, correct calculation.

C) \(1.8\): Perhaps a student calculates \(3 * 0.6 = 1.8\) (mistaking \(0.3^2 = 0.6\)), or directly multiplies \(3 * 0.3\) without squaring.

D) \(2.7\): A possible mistake could be \(3 * 0.9 = 2.7\) (erroneously considering \(0.3^2 = 0.9\)).

## 5: Error Analysis formalization
A) This choice results from an error where a student improperly applies exponential and multiplication rules, perhaps confusing \(3^2 * 0.09\).

B) Correct answer; no error.

C) Might arise from incorrect linear application, i.e., not squaring 0.3.

D) May come from adding or directly multiplying without proper exponentiation.

## 6: Predictions based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students might not understand the concept of \(x^2\) and multiplication properly. So, they are likely to pick answers based on simple additions or multiplications: C (30%), D (25%), A (20%), B (25%).
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic operations but might struggle with applying them correctly in formulas. Expect them to still make significant errors: C (25%), D (20%), A (15%), B (40%).
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately apply mathematical operations. Errors will be less common: A (5%), C (5%), D (5%), B (85%).
- **Advanced**: These students have a strong grasp and will likely get it right or make very unique errors not listed: A (0%), C (0%), D (0%), B (100%).

## 7: Specific Predictions
Error Analysis:
A) Mistaken application of powers and coefficients, resulting in an incorrect high value.
B) No mistake, \(0.27\).
C) Failing to square \(x\), treating it as linear.
D) Mishandling coefficients and exponents, possibly through incorrect doubling.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
