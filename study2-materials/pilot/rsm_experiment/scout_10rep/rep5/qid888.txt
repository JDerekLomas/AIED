## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\).

## 2: Correct Solution
To solve this, students should apply the FOIL method, which stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. This means multiplying the first terms in each bracket, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, and finally the last terms in each bracket, and then adding them all together:
\[
(m-5)(m-7) = m \cdot m + m \cdot (-7) - 5 \cdot m - 5 \cdot (-7)
\]
\[
= m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35
\]
\[
= m^2 - 12m + 35
\]
So, the correct answer is B) \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 3: Error Analysis
A) \(m^2 - 2m - 35\): A student might arrive at this answer by incorrectly applying the FOIL method or not paying attention to the signs, possibly calculating it as \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35\), which simplifies to \(m^2 - 12m - 35\), but let's correct that: the actual mistake here seems to be adding the \(-7m\) and \(-5m\) to get \(-2m\) and then incorrectly subtracting 35.

B) \(m^2 - 12m + 35\): This is the correct answer, so no error analysis is needed here.

C) \(m^2 + 12m + 35\): A student might get this by adding the terms incorrectly: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\) becomes \(m^2 + 12m + 35\) if they add \( -7m - 5m\) to get \(+12m\), which is incorrect.

D) \(m^2 - 12m - 35\): A student might arrive at this by calculating \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35\), correctly getting \(m^2 - 12m - 35\), indicating a mistake in handling the \(+35\) from \(-5 \cdot -7\).

## 4: Specific Errors
A) A student would choose A by mistakenly thinking \(-7m - 5m = -2m\) and ignoring the correct signs and values.
B) Correct calculation using FOIL method.
C) A student chooses C by mistakenly thinking \(-7m - 5m = +12m\), incorrectly combining the terms.
D) A student chooses D by forgetting that \(-5 \cdot -7 = +35\), thus incorrectly subtracting 35.

## 5: Predictions
- **below_basic**: At this level, students struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not apply the FOIL method correctly or confuse operations.
  - A: 20% (confusing term combinations)
  - B: 30% (some understanding but easily confused)
  - C: 20% (incorrectly combining terms with wrong sign)
  - D: 30% (forgetting the positive product of two negatives)

- **basic**: Students have a foundational understanding but may make careless mistakes.
  - A: 10% (simple arithmetic mistakes)
  - B: 50% (understanding but might make minor errors)
  - C: 15% (mistake in combining like terms)
  - D: 25% ( oversight in signs or operations)

- **proficient**: These students understand the FOIL method but might occasionally make mistakes under pressure.
  - A: 5% (occasional lapse in arithmetic)
  - B: 80% (strong understanding of FOIL)
  - C: 5% (quick mistake in calculation)
  - D: 10% (rare oversight)

- **advanced**: Students have a strong grasp of algebra and apply it accurately.
  - A: 2% (very rare mistake)
  - B: 90% (confident and accurate application)
  - C: 2% (unlikely but possible mistake under stress)
  - D: 6% (rare but possible error)

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might arrive at this answer by incorrectly applying the FOIL method, thinking \(-7m - 5m = -2m\).
B) This is the correct application of the FOIL method.
C) A student might get this by incorrectly adding \(-7m - 5m\) to get \(+12m\).
D) A student might choose this by forgetting that \(-5 \cdot -7 = +35\).

Predictions:
