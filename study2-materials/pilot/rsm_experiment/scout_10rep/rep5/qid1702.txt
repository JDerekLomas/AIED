## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the task
The equation given is \(10x - 6y = 30\), and we need to find the value of \(x\) when \(y = 0.5\).

## 2: Solve the equation for \(x\) when \(y = 0.5\)
Substitute \(y = 0.5\) into the equation:
\(10x - 6(0.5) = 30\)
Simplifying:
\(10x - 3 = 30\)
\(10x = 33\)
\(x = 3.3\)

## 3: Analyze the error for each wrong answer
A) \(4.25\): A student might arrive at this answer by incorrect substitution or calculation, such as \(10x - 6(0.5) = 10x - 3 = 30\), leading to \(10x = 33\), but then mistakenly solving it as \(x = 33 / 10 + 1 = 4.3 - 0.05 = 4.25\) or similar incorrect arithmetic.

B) \(-4.25\): This could result from a sign error, such as \(10x + 6(0.5) = 30\), leading to \(10x + 3 = 30\), then \(10x = 27\), and \(x = 2.7\). Alternatively, a mistake in solving the equation could yield a negative value, such as mistakenly using \(-6y\) as \(+6y\) or reversing the signs in solving.

C) \(3.3\): This is actually the correct answer, not a wrong one. A student who correctly solves the equation will get \(x = 3.3\).

D) \(2.7\): A possible error here could be from miscalculation: \(10x - 6y = 30\), substituting \(y = 0.5\) gives \(10x - 3 = 30\), hence \(10x = 33\), and \(x = 3.3\). A mistake could be \(10x = 27\), leading to \(x = 2.7\), possibly from using wrong numbers or operations.

## 4: Specific error analysis for wrong answers
A) A student might incorrectly calculate \(x\) by possibly adding or subtracting incorrectly, like assuming \(10x = 42.5\) which leads to \(x = 4.25\).

B) A student might incorrectly add instead of subtract \(6y\), or make a calculation mistake like solving \(10x = -27\), resulting in \(x = -2.7\), and then through error, getting \(-4.25\).

C) The star should actually be \(3.3\), but analyzing errors:
- C) \(3.3\) is correct, so no error.

D) A student could mistakenly calculate or not solve for \(x\) properly, obtaining a wrong value like \(x = 2.7\).

## 5: Error analysis concluded
A) Incorrect arithmetic leading to a higher value.
B) Sign error or large calculation mistake.
C) Actually correct, so not applicable.
D) Possible arithmetic mistake leading to underestimation.

## 6: Predictions

  - A: 20% (some might guess or make a simple arithmetic mistake).
  - B: 15% ( significant mistake, like sign error).
  - C: 10% ( might understand it’s related to correct answer but calculation mistake).
  - D: 55% ( common mistake could lead to simple, rounded numbers).

  - A: 10%
  - B: 10%
  - C: 60% ( getting it right or close due to understanding the method).
  - D: 20%

- **Proficient**: Students understand the method but might still make small errors.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 85% (strong understanding, fewer errors).
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced**: Students have a strong understanding and rarely make errors.
  - A: 2%
  - B: 2%
  - C: 95%
  - D: 1%

The best answer is C. 

Error Analysis:
