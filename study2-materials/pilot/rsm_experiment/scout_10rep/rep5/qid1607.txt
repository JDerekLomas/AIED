## Step 1: Analyzing the equation and Isaac's steps
The given equation is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \( k \), we first multiply both sides by 4 to get \( 60 = 1 + k \). Then, we subtract 1 from both sides to find \( k = 59 \).

## 2: Evaluating Isaac's steps
Isaac's Step 1: \( 60 = 1 + k \) is correct because multiplying both sides of the original equation by 4 yields this result.
Isaac's Step 2: \( 61 = k \) is incorrect because subtracting 1 from \( 60 = 1 + k \) gives \( k = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 3: Error Analysis for each option
A) Only step 1: A student choosing this option recognizes that Step 1 is correct but fails to check the validity of Step 2 or assumes Step 2 is incorrect without evaluating it.
B) Only step 2: This would involve a student who incorrectly believes Step 2 is right and either doesn't check Step 1 or thinks Step 1 is incorrect.
C) Both steps are correct: A student who chooses this option incorrectly verifies both steps, possibly misinterpreting the algebraic manipulations or not checking the solution.
D) Both steps are incorrect: This choice indicates a student understands that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is wrong, or they identify errors in both steps.

## 4: Detailed Error Analysis
A) A student might choose A if they correctly derive \( 60 = 1 + k \) but don't complete the verification of Step 2 or incorrectly assess its validity.
B) Choosing B suggests a misunderstanding in algebraic manipulation, specifically in solving for \( k \) after obtaining \( 60 = 1 + k \), and potentially an error in evaluating the correctness of Step 1.
C) Choosing C indicates a lack of understanding in algebraic manipulations; the student seems to validate both incorrect and correct steps without accurately assessing their validity.
D) Choosing D means the student recognizes both steps' accuracy or inaccuracy correctly; for Isaac's steps, Step 1 is correct, and Step 2 is incorrect.

## 5: Predictions
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might have trouble with basic algebraic manipulations. They might randomly select or choose based on surface-level understanding.
  - A: 20% (partial understanding)
  - B: 30% (errors in calculation or understanding)
  - C: 10% (difficulty in evaluating step correctness)
  - D: 40% (awareness of some steps' incorrectness)

- **Basic**: Students have a foundational understanding but might struggle with application.
  - A: 15% (some recognize Step 1's correctness)
  - B: 20% (may calculate or reason incorrectly)
  - C: 5% (overconfidence in steps' correctness)
  - D: 60% (can identify correct and incorrect steps)

- **Proficient**: Students understand algebraic concepts but might make occasional errors.
  - A: 5% (partial recognition)
  - B: 10% (occasional miscalculation)
  - C: 5% (overconfidence or slight misunderstanding)
  - D: 80% (accurately assess both steps)

- **Advanced**: Students have a deep understanding and can critically evaluate steps.
  - A: 0% ( unlikely to mistakenly validate only Step 1 without checking Step 2)
  - B: 0% (aware of the mistake in Step 2)
  - C: 0% (know both steps' validity)
  - D: 100% (critically evaluate both steps accurately)

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student chooses A if they recognize Step 1 as correct but do not verify or incorrectly assess Step 2.
B) A student chooses B if they think Step 2 is correct and either do not evaluate Step 1 properly or consider it incorrect.
C) A student chooses C if they incorrectly validate both steps.
D) A student chooses D if they correctly identify that Step 1 is correct and Step 2 is incorrect.
