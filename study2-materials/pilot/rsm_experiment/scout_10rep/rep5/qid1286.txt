## Step 1: Understand the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

## 2: Derive the formula for the radius of a sphere
To find the radius \(r\) in terms of \(V\), we rearrange the formula:
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
\[r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\]
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]

## 3: Analyze the error for each wrong answer
A) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \): This answer would result from incorrectly rearranging the volume formula, mistakenly keeping the \(4\pi\) term in the numerator instead of moving it to the denominator and adjusting for \(\pi\) and the coefficient \(4\).

B) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \): This would come from swapping \(\pi\) and the coefficient \(4\) incorrectly in the denominator, leading to \(4\) being outside the fraction and \(\pi\) being in the denominator.

C) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \): This is actually the correct formula for the radius, matching the derivation in Step 2.

D) \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \): This answer suggests a misinterpretation of how to solve for \(r\), perhaps incorrectly taking the cube root of \(V\) separately and then applying the remaining constants in a linear fashion rather than within the cube root.

## 4: Predict the response distribution based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and formula rearrangements. They are more likely to choose answers that reflect a misunderstanding of the basic principles or a simple mistake in calculation.
  - A: 30% (simple mistake with the constants)
  - B: 25% (misplacement of constants)
  - C: 10% (correct answer, unexpectedly)
  - D: 35% (misinterpretation of formula)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with rearranging complex formulas.
  - A: 20% (error in constant manipulation)
  - B: 15% (similar error)
  - C: 25% (correct, showing some understanding)
  - D: 40% (alternative incorrect manipulation)

- **Proficient**: These students are expected to have a solid grasp of algebraic techniques and formula manipulation.
  - A: 10% (less likely to make such errors)
  - B: 5% (very specific mistake)
  - C: 80% (correct answer, demonstrating understanding)
  - D: 5% (unlikely, given their proficiency)

- **Advanced**: Advanced students are expected to not only understand but also apply concepts accurately and efficiently.
  - A: 0% (unlikely error for this group)
  - B: 0% (similarly unlikely)
  - C: 95% (correct, showing mastery)
  - D: 5% (extreme cases or alternative, misguided logic)

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student would choose this by incorrectly rearranging the volume formula, mistakenly keeping the \(4\pi\) term in the numerator.
B) A student would choose this by misplacing the \(\pi\) and the coefficient \(4\) in the denominator.
C) This is the correct formula for the radius, derived properly from the volume formula.
D) A student would choose this by misinterpreting how to solve for \(r\), applying constants incorrectly.
