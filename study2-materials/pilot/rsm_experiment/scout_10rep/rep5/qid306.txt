## Step 1: Understanding the Questions
First, let's analyze the two problems given: \( 4-5+6= \) and \( 4+5 \times 6= \). For Problem P, \( 4-5+6= \), the correct order of operations is to perform the operations from left to right since they are all addition and subtraction: \( 4 - 5 + 6 \). This means the first calculation should indeed be \( 4 - 5 \). For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6= \), following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), the first calculation should be \( 5 \times 6 \) because multiplication comes before addition.

## 2: Error Analysis for Each Option
A) Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - This option correctly identifies the first operation for Problem P but incorrectly suggests \( 4+5 \) for Problem Q, which should be \( 5 \times 6 \) first. The error here is not following the order of operations for Problem Q.

B) Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - This option correctly identifies the first operations for both problems: \( 4-5 \) for Problem P and \( 5 \times 6 \) for Problem Q. It seems this could be the correct answer, not an error.

C) Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - This option incorrectly identifies the operations. For Problem P, it suggests adding \( 5+6 \) first, which is incorrect because subtraction comes first. For Problem Q, it suggests \( 4+5 \) first, which is also incorrect because multiplication comes before addition.

D) Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - This option incorrectly identifies \( 5+6 \) as the first operation for Problem P but correctly identifies \( 5 \times 6 \) as the first operation for Problem Q.

## 3: Specific Error Analysis
A) A student choosing A would be incorrect in Problem Q by not applying the order of operations correctly, specifically neglecting that multiplication precedes addition.

B) There seems to be no error here; this option aligns with the correct order of operations.

C) A student choosing C demonstrates not understanding the order of operations for both problems: they incorrectly prioritize addition over subtraction in Problem P and addition over multiplication in Problem Q.

D) A student choosing D incorrectly prioritizes \( 5+6 \) over \( 4-5 \) in Problem P but shows understanding of the order of operations for Problem Q.

## 4: Predictions Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students might not understand the order of operations at all. 
  - A: XX% - Might choose because they misunderstood both but especially Q.
  - B: XX% - Unlikely; this seems mostly correct.
  - C: XX% - Plausible because it shows confusion in both.
  - D: XX% - Also plausible; shows some understanding of Q but not P.

- **Basic**: Students have a basic understanding but might struggle with applying rules consistently.
  - A: XX% - Possible due to oversight in Q.
  - B: XX% - High; basic understanding usually includes correct sequence.
  - C: XX% - Possible; shows misunderstanding.
  - D: XX% - Possible; right for Q, wrong for P.

- **Proficient**: Students understand and mostly apply the order of operations correctly.
  - A: XX% - Low; would understand Q but might not B.
  - B: XX% - High; correct understanding.
  - C: XX% - Low; would understand both problems.
  - D: XX% - Low; right for Q but indicates confusion.

- **Advanced**: Students consistently and accurately apply the order of operations.
  - A: XX% - Very low; advanced students know better.
  - B: XX% - Very high; aligns with correct understanding.
  - C: XX% - Very low; demonstrates lack of understanding.
  - D: XX% - Very low; wrong for P.

The best answer is B. 

Error Analysis:
A) A student chooses A because they don't follow the order of operations correctly for Problem Q.
B) There is no error; B is correct.
C) A student chooses C because they misunderstand the order of operations for both problems.
D) A student chooses D because they incorrectly prioritize operations in Problem P.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5%
