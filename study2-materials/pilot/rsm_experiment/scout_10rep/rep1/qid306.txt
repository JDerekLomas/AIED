## Error Analysis:

A) To choose A, a student would incorrectly apply the order of operations by suggesting that in Problem P, \( 4-5 \) should be done first (which is correct but then incorrectly paired with an incorrect suggestion for Problem Q, \( 4+5 \), implying they don't recognize multiplication should be done before addition). 

B) For B, a student correctly identifies that in Problem P, \( 4-5 \) should be done first (as it's the first operation from left to right) and correctly identifies \( 5 \times 6 \) should be done first in Problem Q (following the order of operations, multiplication before addition). This option actually represents correct reasoning.

C) To choose C, a student mistakenly suggests \( 5+6 \) for Problem P, which is incorrect because it ignores the order given and jumps to addition first without considering subtraction, and \( 4+5 \) for Problem Q, which incorrectly prioritizes addition over multiplication.

D) For D, a student incorrectly suggests \( 5+6 \) for Problem P, indicating a misconception about the order of operations in the context of only addition and subtraction (should proceed from left to right, so \( 4-5 \) first), and correctly \( 5 \times 6 \) for Problem Q.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often lack understanding of the order of operations.
  - A: 20% (simple incorrect ordering)
  - B: 10% (confused but a glimmer of understanding)
  - C: 30% (adds first in P, showing misunderstanding)
  - D: 40% (also misunderstands, but could latch onto multiplication correctly)

- **Basic**: At this level, students start to learn the basics of order of operations.
  - A: 15% (common error, following sequence wrongly)
  - B: 25% (correct understanding)
  - C: 25% (suggesting incorrect additions)
  - D: 35% (more recognize \( 5 \times 6 \) should come first)

- **Proficient**: These students are generally solid on order of operations.
  - A: 5% (now rarely choose this)
  - B: 60% (the majority, especially noting they pick correct order for both)
  - C: 10% (holding onto errors from lack of experience)
  - D: 25% (many proficient might choose multiplication over first for Q)

- **Advanced**: Mastery level; errors are expected to be minimal.
  - A: 0% (extremely few to choose obviously wrong)
  - B: 80% (clear understanding demonstrated here)
  - C: 5% (a very rare mistake showing carelessness)
  - D: 15% (advanced but human error leads some here)

Given typical behavior and error tendencies, students generally perform correctly once proficient or advance. Without numbers I assumed based patterns
