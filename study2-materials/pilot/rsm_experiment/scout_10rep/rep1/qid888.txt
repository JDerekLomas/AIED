## Step 1: Expand the given expression \((m-5)(m-7)\) to understand the correct answer.
To expand \((m-5)(m-7)\), we apply the FOIL method, which stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. This means we multiply the first terms in each bracket, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, and finally the last terms in each bracket, and then add them all together: \(m \cdot m + m \cdot (-7) - 5 \cdot m - 5 \cdot (-7)\).

## 2: Perform the multiplication.
\(m \cdot m = m^2\), \(m \cdot (-7) = -7m\), \(-5 \cdot m = -5m\), and \(-5 \cdot (-7) = 35\). So, the expression becomes \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\).

## 3: Simplify the expression.
Combine like terms: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\). This means the correct answer is \(m^2 - 12m + 35\), which corresponds to option B.

## 4: Analyze the errors for each wrong option.
A) \(m^2 - 2m - 35\): A student might arrive at this answer by incorrectly multiplying the terms, possibly using \(m \cdot m = m^2\), \(m \cdot (-7) + (-5) \cdot m = -2m\) (incorrectly combining these), and \(-5 \cdot (-7) = 35\), but the mistake here is not adding the middle terms correctly as \(-7m - 5m = -12m\), not \(-2m\).

B) This is the correct answer, so there's no error.

C) \(m^2 + 12m + 35\): A student might get this by incorrectly adding the middle terms, using \(m \cdot m = m^2\), \(m \cdot (-7) = -7m\), \(-5 \cdot m = -5m\) (and then incorrectly adding these to get \(+12m\)), and \(-5 \cdot (-7) = 35\). The mistake is in adding \(-7m - 5m\) to get \(+12m\) instead of \(-12m\).

D) \(m^2 - 12m - 35\): A student might arrive at this by multiplying the terms correctly as \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\), but then mistakenly subtracting 35 instead of adding it, or simply making a sign error in the constant term.

## 5: Specific error analysis for each wrong answer.
A) The error is in not correctly combining the middle terms, resulting in \(-2m\) instead of \(-12m\).
B) No error, this is correct.
C) The error is in incorrectly adding the middle terms to get \(+12m\) instead of \(-12m\).
D) The error is in the constant term, getting \(-35\) instead of \(+35\).

## 6: Predict the response distribution based on student ability levels.
- **below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They are more likely to make simple arithmetic mistakes or misunderstand the process entirely. 
  - A: 30% (simple mistake, might not follow order correctly)
  - B: 20% (some might get it right by chance or partial understanding)
  - C: 25% (add middle terms incorrectly)
  - D: 25% (sign error or constant term mistake)

- **basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with applying the rules consistently.
  - A: 15% 
  - B: 50% 
  - C: 20% 
  - D: 15%

- **proficient**: These students understand the process but might occasionally make careless mistakes.
  - A: 5% 
  - B: 80% 
  - C: 10% 
  - D: 5%

- **advanced**: Students at this level are very familiar with the process and less likely to make mistakes.
  - A: 1% 
  - B: 95% 
  - C: 2% 
  - D: 2%

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might arrive at this answer by incorrectly multiplying the terms, possibly using m⋅m=m2, m⋅(−7)+(−5)⋅m=−2m (incorrectly combining these), and −5⋅(−7)=35.
B) No error, this is correct.
C) A student might get this by incorrectly adding the middle terms, using m⋅m=m2, m⋅(−7
