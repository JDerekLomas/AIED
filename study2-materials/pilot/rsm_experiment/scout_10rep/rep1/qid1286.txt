## Step 1: Understand the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

## 2: Derive the formula for the radius of a sphere
To find the radius \(r\) in terms of \(V\), we rearrange the formula:
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
Multiplying both sides by \(\frac{3}{4\pi}\):
\[r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\]
Taking the cubic root of both sides:
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]

## 3: Analyze each option for errors
A) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \): This option incorrectly swaps the \(4\pi\) and \(3\) in the denominator and includes \(\pi\) in the numerator instead of the denominator, suggesting a confusion in rearranging the formula.

B) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \): This option incorrectly keeps \(4\) in the numerator and does not account for \(\pi\) in the denominator properly, indicating a mistake in rearranging the volume formula.

C) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \): This is the correct formula for the radius, as derived.

D) \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \): This option suggests taking the cubic root of \(V\) first and then applying the rest of the formula, which is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\) transformation.

## 4: Error Analysis
A) A student choosing A might have mistakenly multiplied by \(\pi\) and put \(4\) in the numerator instead of solving for \(r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\).

B) A student choosing B likely misunderstood the division and multiplication relationships in the volume formula, failing to correctly isolate \(r\).

C) A student choosing C has correctly solved for \(r\), indicating no error.

D) A student choosing D may have misinterpreted how to solve for \(r\) when \(V\) is given, incorrectly factoring \(V\).

## 5: Predictions
- **Below Basic**: These students might not fully understand the formula or how to solve for \(r\). They might pick A or D due to confusion with the constants and operations (A=30%, B=15%, C=20%, D=35%).
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might make simple algebraic mistakes. They could choose A, B, or D due to not fully grasping how to rearrange the formula correctly (A=25%, B=25%, C=30%, D=20%).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the formula and can rearrange it. They are less likely to choose incorrect options but might still make minor errors (A=10%, B=10%, C=70%, D=10%).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident and understand the relationship between \(V\) and \(r\). They are most likely to choose C (A=2%, B=2%, C=92%, D=4%).

The final answer is: 
Error Analysis:
A) Incorrectly rearranged the volume formula, possibly confusing the numerator and denominator.
B) Incorrectly rearranged the formula, omitting \(\pi\) from the denominator.
C) Correctly derived from \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\).
D) Misinterpreted the formula, incorrectly separating \(V\) and the constants.
