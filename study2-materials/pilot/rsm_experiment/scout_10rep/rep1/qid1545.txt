## Step 1: Analyzing the Question
The question requires students to compare the values of two expressions: $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$. To solve this, we need to apply the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 2: Calculating the Expressions
First, calculate $8+12 \div 4$:
- Division first: $12 \div 4 = 3$
- Then addition: $8 + 3 = 11$

Then, calculate $(8+12) \div 4$:
- Parentheses first: $8 + 12 = 20$
- Then division: $20 \div 4 = 5$

## 3: Comparing the Expressions
Now, compare the results:
- $8+12 \div 4 = 11$
- $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$

Since $11 > 5$, the correct symbol to use is $>$.

## 4: Error Analysis
A) Choosing A ($>$) is actually the correct answer, so no error is made by choosing this option if the calculations are correct.

B) Choosing B ($<$) suggests that the student believes $11 < 5$, indicating a miscalculation or misunderstanding of the order of operations.

C) Choosing C ($=$) implies that the student thinks $11 = 5$, which shows a significant miscalculation.

D) Choosing D ($\geq$) suggests uncertainty or a belief that $11$ could be equal to or greater than $5$, which might indicate some understanding but also a lack of precision in calculation or comparison.

## 5: Specific Errors Leading to Wrong Answers
A) [No error, this is the correct choice]

B) A student might choose B if they miscalculate both expressions incorrectly but in a way that makes them believe the second expression is larger, or if they mistakenly think the expressions are equal but then incorrectly decide the second is larger.

C) A student choosing C likely misunderstands the order of operations or miscalculates both expressions to be equal.

D) A student might choose D if they are unsure about the calculations but recognize $11$ is indeed greater than $5$, or if they mistakenly believe there's a scenario where the expressions could be equal.

## 6: Predictions
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students may not fully understand the order of operations. Thus, they might be more likely to choose incorrectly based on simple miscalculations or wrong operations.
  - A=10% (some might accidentally get it right)
  - B=40% (miscalculation leading to wrong comparison)
  - C=30% (thinking expressions are equal due to incorrect calculations)
  - D=20% (uncertainty)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make calculation errors.
  - A=20% (some correct understanding)
  - B=35% (common misconceptions)
  - C=25% (equating due to similar but wrong calculations)
  - D=20% (some uncertainty)

- **Proficient**: Students with a good grasp of the order of operations are less likely to make simple errors.
  - A=60% (correct understanding and calculation)
  - B=15% (occasional miscalculation)
  - C=10% (rarely thinking they're equal)
  - D=15% (some might be uncertain)

- **Advanced**: These students have a strong understanding and are less likely to make errors.
  - A=80% (confident in correct calculation and comparison)
  - B=5% (very rare miscalculation)
  - C=5% (rare misunderstanding)
  - D=10% (unlikely to be uncertain)

The final answer is: 
Error Analysis:
A) No error, correct choice
B) Miscalculation or misunderstanding of order of operations leading to incorrect comparison
C) Misunderstanding of order of operations or miscalculation leading to equality
D) Uncertainty or incorrect consideration of equality
