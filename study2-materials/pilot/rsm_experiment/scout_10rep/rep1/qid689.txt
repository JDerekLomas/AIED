## Step 1: Analyze the equation and the solution process.
The given equation is \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\). To solve for \(p\), we multiply both sides by \(p\) to get \(10p = 5\), and then divide both sides by 10 to find \(p = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5\).

## 2: Identify the errors leading to each wrong answer.
A) \( p = 0.5 \): This is actually the correct solution to the equation. No error here, but let's assume a student might mistakenly think this is incorrect or they derived it but are unsure.

B) \( p = 50 \): A student might arrive at this answer by incorrectly manipulating the equation, such as \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\) becoming \(10p = 5p\) (incorrectly canceling out \(p\) or confusion in algebraic manipulation), or simply inverting the fraction and multiplying by 10 (\(5 \times 10 = 50\)) without properly solving for \(p\).

C) \( p = 2 \): This could come from a miscalculation or incorrect inversion of operations, such as \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\) leading to \(p = 5 \times 10 / 5 = 10\), but then mistakenly halving 5 to get 2.5 and then thinking of 2, or direct guesswork.

D) \( p = \): There are no solutions. A student might think there are no solutions if they incorrectly conclude that \(p\) would be undefined or zero (which would actually make the fraction \(\frac{5}{p}\) undefined, not the equation \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\) itself, since \(p = 0.5\) is a valid solution).

## 3: Correctly describe the error for each option.
A) A student choosing A actually gets it right but may second-guess themselves.

B) A student might mistakenly multiply 5 by 10 directly without properly accounting for \(p\).

C) A possible mistake involves confusing the coefficients or misapplying operations.

D) A student thinks \(p\) cannot be solved for or results in an undefined mathematical operation.

## 4: Predict the response distribution based on student ability levels.
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to have significant difficulties with algebraic manipulations. 
  - A: 20% (some actually get it right or through random chance)
  - B: 40% (inversion and direct multiplication mistakes)
  - C: 20% (guesswork or simple miscalculation)
  - D: 20% (misunderstanding equation solvability)

- **Basic**: These students have some grasp of algebra but make consistent errors.
  - A: 30% (getting it right but possibly through guessing)
  - B: 50% (direct calculation mistakes)
  - C: 15% (simple operational mistakes)
  - D: 5% (less likely to think there are no solutions)

- **Proficient**: These students generally understand algebraic processes but may make careless mistakes.
  - A: 60% (competent and getting it right)
  - B: 30% (occasional miscalculation)
  - C: 5% (minor mistake)
  - D: 5% (unfamiliar or complex misinterpretation)

- **Advanced**: These students are highly competent and less likely to make errors.
  - A: 90% (confidence in getting it right)
  - B: 5% (rare miscalculation)
  - C: 2% (extremely rare mistake)
  - D: 3% (very unlikely to consider no solutions)

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student actually solves the equation correctly but might doubt their answer.
B) A student might mistakenly think \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\) means \(p = 5 \times 10 = 50\).
C) A student could calculate incorrectly, such as \(5 \div 10 = 0.5\) but consider \(5 \times 2 = 10\), inverting to get \(p = 2\).
D) A student might mistakenly believe \(p=0\) would be a solution and thus think about division by zero.

Predictions:
