## Step 1: Analyze the given equation and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\). To solve for \(k\), the correct steps would involve multiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, resulting in \(60 = 1 + k\), and then subtracting 1 from both sides to isolate \(k\), yielding \(k = 59\).

## 2: Evaluate Isaac's steps
Isaac's Step 1: \(60 = 1 + k\) is correct because multiplying both sides of the equation \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\) by 4 gives \(60 = 1 + k\).
Isaac's Step 2: \(61 = k\) is incorrect because subtracting 1 from \(60 = 1 + k\) gives \(k = 59\), not \(61\).

## 3: Identify the errors leading to each wrong answer
Error Analysis:
A) Choosing A implies that only Step 1 is correct. A student might choose this if they recognize Step 1 is correct but haven't checked Step 2 or made an error in Step 2.
B) Choosing B implies that only Step 2 is correct, which would mean a student incorrectly verified Step 2 without realizing Step 1 is actually correct.
C) Choosing C implies both steps are correct, which would indicate a student failed to notice the mistake in Step 2.
D) Choosing D implies both steps are incorrect. A student might choose this if they correctly identify the mistake in Step 2 but mistakenly believe there's an error in Step 1.

## 4: Specify the errors
A) A student chooses A if they see Step 1 as correct but are unsure or incorrectly assess Step 2.
B) A student chooses B if they mistakenly think Step 2 is correct without properly verifying it against the equation.
C) A student chooses C if they incorrectly confirm both steps without properly checking the arithmetic in Step 2.
D) A student chooses D if they realize Step 2 is wrong but then mistakenly question the validity of Step 1.

## 5: Predict the response distribution based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not even attempt to verify Step 1 correctly or understand the process, leading to a higher chance of selecting D due to confusion.
- **Basic**: Students here understand basic concepts but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They could choose B if they incorrectly validate Step 2.
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebra but might choose A if they see the correctness of Step 1 but miss the error in Step 2.
- **Advanced**: This group would likely choose D, recognizing both the correctness of Step 1 and the error in Step 2.

## 6: Provide specific predictions
Given the errors and ability levels:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (lack of understanding), B=20% (simple mistake), C=10% (completely misguided), D=40% (total confusion).
- **Basic**: A=40% (partial understanding), B=30% (arithmetic mistake), C=15% (partially correct), D=15% (some critical thinking).
- **Proficient**: A=50% (accurately assess Step 1), B=15% (small mistake), C=5% (overconfidence), D=30% (comprehensive understanding).
- **Advanced**: A=10% (unlikely to miss Step 2), B=5% (very rare mistake), C=0% (understand both steps' validity), D=85% (critical evaluation).

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student chooses A if they see Step 1 as correct but are unsure or incorrectly assess Step 2.
B) A student chooses B if they mistakenly think Step 2 is correct without properly verifying it against the equation.
C) A student chooses C if they incorrectly confirm both steps without properly checking the arithmetic in Step 2.
D) A student chooses D if they realize Step 2 is wrong but then mistakenly question the validity of Step 1.

Predictions:

basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=50% B=15% C=5% D=30%
