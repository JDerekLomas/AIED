## Error Analysis:

A) To arrive at \( +4 \), a student might incorrectly multiply \( -1 \) by \( -4 \) but then mistakenly think the result is positive because "two negatives make a positive," which is correct, but they might not apply the correct multiplication, thinking \( 1 \times 4 = 4 \) directly without considering the negative signs properly.

B) To arrive at \( -4 \), a student might make a correct calculation: \( -1 \times -4 = +4 \), but then mistakenly write down \( -4 \), possibly because they then incorrectly add or subtract something, or because their calculation was incorrectly transcribed.

C) To arrive at \( +5 \), a student could incorrectly think that \( -1 \times -4 = 5 \), possibly misremembering the multiplication fact or incorrectly applying an operation.

D) To arrive at \( -5 \), a student might mistakenly perform \( -1 \times 4 = -4 \) and then add 1, or incorrectly apply \( -1 \times -4 \) thinking it equals \( -5 \) for unknown reasons.

## Predictions:

Given typical student understanding and errors in mathematics:

- **Below Basic**: Students here struggle with basic operations. 
  - A: 20% (Mix-up of basic operations and misunderstandings of negatives)
  - B: 15% (Might calculate correctly but make transposition errors)
  - C: 25% (Confusion with basic multiplication facts)
  - D: 40% (Insecure with multiplication, leading to guessing)

- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic math concepts but might apply them inaccurately.
  - A: 10% (As their arithmetic improves, straightforward errors decrease)
  - B: 20% (Recognize multiplication but can make sign errors)
  - C: 15% (May start to see correct procedure but misapply)
  - D: 55% (Starting to understand it’s \( +4 \) but may get confused)

- **Proficient**: Students here have a good grasp of the concepts.
  - A: 5% (Minor slips in attention to detail)
  - B: 10% (The straightforward calculation mistake)
  - C: 5% (Unlikely to confuse facts completely)
  - D: 80% (Knowing \( -1 \times -4 = 4 \), the minus makes the product positive)

- **Advanced**: 
  - A: 0% (Solid grip on basic and complicated operations)
  - B: 0% (Can see directly there was no \( - \) to begin)
  - C: 0% (Unlikely to mistaken multiplication with much higher incorrect results)
  - D: 0% (Understand clearly and select correct approach; here it seems they could see none directly; however knowledge not represented)
This results is wrong no change.

The best answer is A.
