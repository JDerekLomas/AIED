## Step 1: Understand the question and the correct process for multiplying out the brackets
The question asks to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct process involves using the FOIL method: First, Outer, Inner, Last. This means multiplying the first terms in each bracket, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, and finally the last terms in each bracket, and then adding them all together: \(m \cdot m + m \cdot (-7) - 5 \cdot m - 5 \cdot (-7)\).

## 2: Perform the correct calculation
Applying the FOIL method:
\(m \cdot m = m^2\),
\(m \cdot (-7) = -7m\),
\(-5 \cdot m = -5m\),
\(-5 \cdot (-7) = 35\).
So, \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 3: Analyze the errors for each wrong answer
A) \(m^{2}-2 m-35\): This would result from incorrectly calculating the terms, possibly \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35\) or a similar mistake in combining like terms.
B) \(m^{2}-12 m+35\): This is the correct answer, not an error.
C) \(m^{2}+12 m+35\): This could result from mistakenly adding the terms instead of subtracting, \(m^2 + 7m + 5m + 35\), or incorrectly handling the negative signs.
D) \(m^{2}-12 m-35\): This error might come from \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35\), indicating a mistake in handling the product of the constants.

## 4: Detailed error analysis
A) A student choosing A might have incorrectly applied the FOIL method or combined like terms wrong, possibly calculating \(-7m - 5m = -2m\) instead of \(-12m\).
B) There is no error here; it's the correct calculation.
C) For C, a student might have incorrectly added the middle terms (\(+7m + 5m = +12m\)) instead of subtracting them.
D) For D, the error could be in incorrectly calculating the constant term (\(-35\)) and possibly confused the signs or the multiplication.

## 5: Predict the response distribution
Given the errors:
- **below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the basic application of FOIL or handling negative numbers. They might randomly select or choose based on minimal understanding. A=30% (as they might directly jump to an obviously incorrect option without calculation), B=20% (some might get it right by luck or simple guess), C=20%, D=30%.
- **basic**: Students here have a basic grasp but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. A=20%, B=40% (correct calculation possible), C=20%, D=20%.
- **proficient**: These students understand the FOIL method but might make minor calculation errors. A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **advanced**: Students at this level are highly unlikely to make mistakes. A=0%, B=95%, C=3%, D=2%.

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might calculate \(-7m - 5m = -2m\) instead of \(-12m\), or incorrectly combine terms.
B) Correct answer, no error.
C) A student might add \(7m + 5m\) to get \(+12m\) instead of subtracting.
D) A student might incorrectly calculate or combine the constant term or middle terms.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
