## Error Analysis:

A) To arrive at \( p = 0.5 \), a student might incorrectly solve the equation by multiplying both sides by \( p \) to get \( 10p = 5 \), and then dividing both sides by 10, yielding \( p = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \). This shows a misunderstanding of the algebraic manipulation required to solve for \( p \).

B) For \( p = 50 \), a student correctly multiplies both sides by \( p \) to get \( 10p = 5 \), but then incorrectly divides both sides by 5, resulting in \( 2p = 1 \) or \( p = \frac{1}{2} \) is not considered; instead, they might have done \( 10 = \frac{5}{p} \) leads to \( 10p = 5 \) and then \( p = \frac{5}{10} \) was not computed but thought of as \( p = \frac{5 \times 10}{1} = 50 \) possibly due to confusion with another operation or miscalculation.

C) To get \( p = 2 \), a student might correctly start by multiplying both sides by \( p \) to get \( 10p = 5 \), and then divide both sides by 10, which actually leads to \( p = 0.5 \), not 2. The mistake here seems to be an incorrect division or an incorrect manipulation such as dividing by 5 instead of 10, \( 10 = \frac{5}{p} \) then \( 10p = 5p \) leading to \( p = 2 \) could result from another incorrect step.

D) For "There are no solutions", a student might consider that \( \frac{5}{p} \) can never equal 10 because \( p \) cannot be 0.5 (as calculated in A), or they are mistakenly thinking about conditions under which no solutions exist without directly computing \( p \), reflecting a limited understanding of equations and fractions.


## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students are generally struggling with basic algebraic concepts. They might simply guess or make errors without careful consideration. So, expecting a wide distribution across incorrect answers.
  - A=30% (misinterpretation of direct proportion), B=20% (likely due to inverting fractions incorrectly and adding), C=30% (confusing operations), D=20% (lack of algebraic understanding).

- **Basic:** Here, students are familiar with the basics but still make frequent errors. They are likely to pick wrong answers based on mistakes during computation but might avoid 'no solutions' more often than below-basic students.
  - A=20% (easy swaps of operations), B=20% (error on operations), C=25% (correct attempt gone wrong), D=35% (though incorrect, acknowledging impossibility cases might reduce).

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp but can make the occasional careless mistake. Less likely to end up in D as they understand solution existence but can still compute incorrectly.
  - A=5% (occasional neglect of step), B=5% (simply computational slips), C=15% (faux inversion issue), D=75% but reevaluate this high no; reallocation needed considering students know procedures well)

- **Advanced:** These students are accurate and reflect very few wrong calculation routes due to being conversant with algebra; A, B and C might have single-digit allocations given confidence.

Realistically aligning distribution across ability cohorts:

 - **Predictions Distribution**
below_basic: A=25% B=24% C=25% D=26%
basic: A=17% B=17% C=24% D=42%
proficient: A=6% B=4% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=2% D=95%
