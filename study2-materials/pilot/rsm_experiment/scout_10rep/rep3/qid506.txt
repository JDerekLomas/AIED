## Step 1: Analyze the equation and the correct solution
The given equation is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\). To solve for \(p\), we divide both sides by 3, yielding \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 2: Error Analysis for each wrong answer
A) \(p = \frac{1}{4}\): This would result from incorrectly solving the equation as \(p = \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\), which is a mistaken operation (multiplying instead of dividing).

B) \(p = \frac{1}{36}\): This is actually the correct solution, not an error.

C) \(p = 4\): This answer could come from a miscalculation where a student incorrectly handles the division or fraction, possibly thinking \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) implies \(p = \frac{1}{12} \times 3\) but getting \(12 \times 3 = 36\) and then incorrectly inverting or misinterpreting to get 4.

D) \(p = \frac{1}{9}\): This might result from a student dividing 1 by 3 and then getting \(\frac{1}{3} \div 3 = \frac{1}{9}\) or similar incorrect manipulation.

## 3: Correct Error Analysis
A) A student might think to multiply \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3 instead of dividing by 3, leading to \(\frac{1}{4}\).

B) No error, this is the correct answer.

C) A significant error in calculation or conceptual understanding, possibly misinterpreting the equation.

D) Incorrect division or fraction manipulation.

## 4: Detailed Error Analysis
A) \(p = \frac{1}{4}\): Multiplying \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3 instead of dividing by 3.

B) \(p = \frac{1}{36}\): Correct solution.

C) \(p = 4\): This would likely come from an incorrect manipulation such as \(p = 12 \div 3 = 4\), ignoring the fraction.

D) \(p = \frac{1}{9}\): This could come from incorrectly solving or misreading the equation.
