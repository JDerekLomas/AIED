## Step 1: Understand the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

## 2: Derive the formula for the radius of a sphere
To find the radius \(r\) in terms of \(V\), we rearrange the formula:
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
\[V \cdot \frac{3}{4\pi} = r^3\]
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]

## 3: Analyze each option for errors
A) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \): A student might choose this by incorrectly rearranging the formula, mistakenly multiplying by \(\pi\) and \(4\), and then dividing by \(3\), instead of dividing \(V\) by \(\frac{4}{3}\pi\).

B) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \): This could result from a student forgetting to multiply by \(\pi\) in the denominator during rearrangement.

C) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \): This is the correct formula for the radius.

D) \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \): A student might arrive at this by incorrectly taking the cube root of \(V\) separately and then applying the rest of the formula incorrectly, not fully solving for \(r\).

## 4: Predict the response distribution
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not even attempt the question or would make significant errors. They might randomly select an option or choose based on minimal understanding. Let's assume A=20% (guessing), B=20% (another guess), C=30% (maybe recalling a formula vaguely), D=30% (confused).

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding but might struggle with algebraic manipulations. They might choose A=25% (swapping numbers), B=25% (similar error), C=40% (getting it right or recalling correctly), D=10% (completely lost).

- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the concepts but might make careless mistakes. So, A=10% (minor mistake), B=10% (another small error), C=70% (correct), D=10% (significant mistake).

- **Advanced**: Advanced students are less likely to make errors. Hence, A=5% (very careless), B=5% (similarly careless), C=85% (correct), D=5% (unlikely but possible mistake).

## 5: Summarize predictions in the required format
Error Analysis:
A) Incorrectly rearranged formula, mistakenly including multiplication by \(4\pi\).
B) Forgot \(\pi\) in the denominator.
C) Correct rearrangement of the volume formula to solve for \(r\).
D) Incorrectly separated \(\sqrt[3]{V}\) and misapplied the formula.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=25% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
