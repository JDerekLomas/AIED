## Step 1: Analyze the given equation and the proposed next lines of working.
The given equation is \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\). To assess the correctness of Tom's and Katie's proposed next lines of working, we need to apply basic algebraic principles.

## 2: Evaluate Tom's proposed next line of working.
Tom suggests \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). To verify if this is a correct step, we add 5 to both sides of the original equation: \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5\), which simplifies to \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). Therefore, Tom is correct.

## 3: Evaluate Katie's proposed next line of working.
Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\). To see if this is correct, we first multiply every term in the original equation by 3 to clear the fraction: \(x - 15 = 36\). Katie's suggestion seems to misunderstand this step; correctly multiplying by 3 should give \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\). So, Katie is incorrect because she didn't properly account for multiplying the entire equation by 3.

## 4: Error Analysis for each wrong answer.
A) Only Tom: A student choosing A might recognize Tom's correctness but fail to properly evaluate Katie's suggestion, possibly due to not fully working out Katie's equation or misunderstanding her step.
B) Only Katie: A student choosing B would incorrectly validate Katie's step, likely due to a miscalculation or incorrect application of algebraic rules.
C) Both Tom and Katie: A student choosing C would incorrectly assume both are correct, possibly due to a lack of thorough evaluation of Katie's suggestion.
D) Neither is correct: A student choosing D would incorrectly dismiss both suggestions, likely due to a misunderstanding of the algebraic process or failure to validate Tom's correct suggestion.

## 5: Specific error analysis.
- A: The student acknowledges Tom's correct addition of 5 to both sides but does not properly assess Katie's incorrect multiplication and subtraction.
- B: The student incorrectly validates Katie's multiplication and subtraction steps, possibly not checking if \(x - 5 = 36\) aligns with the original equation.
- C: The student fails to critically evaluate Katie's step, mistakenly believing it to be correct alongside Tom's.
- D: The student might misunderstand basic algebraic manipulations, failing to see Tom's obvious correctness.

## 6: Predictions based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra. They might not fully understand the concept of balancing equations.
  - A=30% (partial understanding, recognizes Tom)
  - B=20% (misunderstands Katie's step as correct)
  - C=20% (lacking critical evaluation skills)
  - D=30% (total misunderstanding)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may make simple mistakes.
  - A=40% (recognizes Tom's correctness)
  - B=15% (some misunderstanding of Katie)
  - C=10% (fails to evaluate critically)
  - D=35% (lacks confidence or understanding)

- **Proficient**: These students understand algebra well but may have minor lapses.
  - A=60% (correctly identifies Tom)
  - B=5% (minor misunderstanding)
  - C=5% (rarely would a proficient student mistakenly think both are correct)
  - D=30% (might second-guess themselves)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and rarely make mistakes.
  - A=80% (clearly see Tom's correctness)
  - B=0% (unlikely to mistakenly validate Katie)
  - C=0% (recognize the sole correctness of Tom)
  - D=20% (extremely rare for them to dismiss both entirely)

The best answer is A.
