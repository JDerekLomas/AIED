## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the table of values.
The equation given is $10x - 6y = 30$. We need to find the value of $x$ when $y = 0.5$.

## 2: Substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation to find $x$.
Substituting $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$, we get $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$. This simplifies to $10x - 3 = 30$.

## 3: Solve for $x$.
Adding 3 to both sides gives $10x = 33$. Dividing both sides by 10 gives $x = 3.3$.

## 4: Analyze the errors for each wrong answer.
A) $4.25$: This could result from incorrect substitution or calculation, such as $10x - 6(0.5) = 10x - 3 = 30$, leading to $10x = 33$ but then incorrectly dividing or calculating, possibly $10x = 42.5$ (which does not directly lead to 4.25, indicating a miscalculation).
B) $-4.25$: This might come from a sign error or incorrect rearrangement of the equation, such as $-10x = 30 - 3$ (incorrectly making $x$ negative or misplacing a negative sign).
C) $3.3$: This is the correct answer, as calculated.
D) $2.7$: This could come from a calculation mistake, such as $10x = 27$ instead of $33$, possibly due to $30 + 3 = 27$ (indicating an addition mistake).

## 5: Specific error analysis for each option.
A) A student might incorrectly solve the equation, for example, by wrongly handling the decimals or misinterpreting the equation, leading to $x = 4.25$.
B) A sign error or incorrect handling of negative numbers could lead to $x = -4.25$.
C) Correct calculation yields $x = 3.3$.
D) A miscalculation, such as mistakenly using $30 - 6*0.5 = 27$ then $10x = 27$, results in $x = 2.7$.

## 6: Predictions based on student ability levels.
