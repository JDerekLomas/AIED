## Step 1: Analyzing the given equation and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \( k \), we first multiply both sides by 4 to get \( 60 = 1 + k \). Then, we subtract 1 from both sides to get \( 59 = k \). Isaac's steps are: Step 1: \( 60 = 1 + k \) and Step 2: \( 61 = k \).

## 2: Identifying the errors in Isaac's steps
Isaac's Step 1 is correct because multiplying both sides of the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \) by 4 indeed yields \( 60 = 1 + k \). However, his Step 2 is incorrect because he writes \( 61 = k \) instead of \( 59 = k \). The correct calculation after Step 1 is \( k = 60 - 1 = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 3: Error Analysis for each option
A) Only step 1: A student might choose this if they agree with Isaac's Step 1 but notice Step 2 is incorrect, or if they don't fully understand the implications of both steps.
B) Only step 2: This would be chosen by a student who incorrectly thinks Step 2 is right but Step 1 is wrong, which seems unlikely given the straightforward nature of Step 1.
C) Both steps are correct: This would be chosen by a student who doesn't notice the error in Step 2 or incorrectly verifies the steps.
D) Both steps are incorrect: A student would choose this if they correctly identify that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect, or if they simply don't trust Isaac's method.

## 4: Detailed Error Analysis
A) A student choosing A might understand the algebraic manipulation but sees the mistake in Step 2, or they might be confused about how to assess the correctness of steps.
B) Choosing B suggests a student thinks subtracting 1 from 60 gives 61, which indicates a basic arithmetic error.
C) Choosing C implies a student does not catch the error in Step 2, suggesting they either don't perform the subtraction correctly or don't check the steps thoroughly.
D) Choosing D indicates a student recognizes both the correctness of Step 1 and the error in Step 2, showing an understanding of the algebraic process.

## 5: Predictions
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulations. They might choose A because they see Step 1 as correct but are unsure about Step 2, B because they made an arithmetic mistake, C because they don't catch the error, or D because they're unsure. Predicted distribution: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic**: Basic level students should understand simple algebra. They might choose A because they see the correct step but not the incorrect one, B due to arithmetic mistakes, C if they don't verify, or D if they notice both issues. Predicted distribution: A=40% B=15% C=15% D=30%
- **Proficient**: Proficient students should accurately solve and evaluate steps. They might choose A if they verify steps carefully, B if they make a careless error, C if they're hasty, or D if they're thorough. Predicted distribution: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
- **Advanced**: Advanced students should easily spot errors and verify steps. They'd likely choose D, with some possibly choosing A if they focus on verification. Predicted distribution: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might choose this if they agree with Isaac's Step 1 but notice Step 2 is incorrect.
B) A student would choose this if they incorrectly think Step 2 is right but do not understand why Step 1 is correct, indicating a possible arithmetic error in thinking.
C) A student choosing C does not notice or incorrectly verifies Step 2.
D) A student chooses D if they correctly identify Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect.
