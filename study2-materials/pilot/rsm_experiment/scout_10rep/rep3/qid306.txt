## Error Analysis:

A) For Problem P, the student correctly identifies that the subtraction should be done first but incorrectly suggests adding 4 and 5 in Problem Q. This shows a misunderstanding of the order of operations.

B) This option suggests doing the subtraction first in Problem P (which is correct) and doing the multiplication first in Problem Q (which is also correct, following the order of operations). However, no student should logically choose an incorrect operation order; thus, this could reflect a student who understands the rules but perhaps hasn't carefully read or considered their response.

C) This option indicates a student who thinks addition should be done before subtraction in Problem P (incorrect) and also incorrectly thinks addition comes before multiplication in Problem Q. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the order of operations.

D) For Problem P, \(5+6\) should not be done first; subtraction and addition have equal precedence and are evaluated from left to right. In Problem Q, \(5 \times 6\) doing first is the right intuition according to the order of operations. A student here seems to slightly understand \( \times \) needs to happen before \(+\) in Q but not considering P properly.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students may lack a solid grasp of basic mathematical operations and their order. 
  - A: 20% ( Some might confuse \(+\) and \(-\), thinking of simple wrong progression)
  - B: 40% ( partially understanding but application incorrect. Gets one part actually right but perhaps by luck/routine with P)
  - C: 25% ( Thinks simple term associations; add/subtract and multiple numbers sequentially)
  - D: 15% (Guesses or partially grasps correct process; aware \(\times\) comes quickly but applies haphazardly)

- **Basic:** Students here have better grasps but confusion in sequences. Could be strong in straightforward but confusion in combination:
  - A: 10% 
  - B: 75% (Know procedures superficially)
  - C: 10%
  - D: 5%

- **Proficient:** Have an understanding and usually stick rigorously to mathematical knowledge yet carelessness/mental disorganisation; rare complete failure with conceptual order understanding. Mistakes not typically conceptual but; rushing.
  - A: 5%'
  - B: 90%
  - C: 3%
  - D: 2%

- **Advanced:** Even higher conceptual certainty with best method and understanding sequence through confidence/expositions making low errors due thorough approach: Only extremely exceptional/ marginal cases with non mathematical reasoning:
  - A: 1%
  - B: 97% or 98 
  - C: Around 1%
  - D : <1% 

Corrected predictions in final response template required exact in final:

The best answer is B
