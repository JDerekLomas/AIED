## Error Analysis:

A) To choose A, a student would mistakenly apply the order of operations incorrectly, thinking that in Problem P, subtraction should be done first because it appears first from left to right, and in Problem Q, they ignore the multiplication and addition, thinking addition should be done first.

B) To choose B, a student demonstrates an understanding of the order of operations for Problem Q (recognizing multiplication should be done before addition) but makes a similar left-to-right mistake for Problem P as in option A. They correctly identify that multiplication should come before addition in Problem Q.

C) To choose C, a student misunderstands the order of operations entirely. For Problem P, they incorrectly prioritize the addition over subtraction, and for Problem Q, they similarly prioritize addition over multiplication, showing a lack of understanding of basic mathematical operations' hierarchy.

D) To choose D, a student correctly understands the order of operations for both problems. For Problem P, they recognize that operations should be performed from left to right when they are of equal precedence (addition and subtraction), and for Problem Q, they correctly prioritize multiplication over addition.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students have a limited understanding of mathematical concepts. They might not fully grasp the order of operations.
  - A=30% (some understanding of operation precedence but flawed)
  - B=20% (partial understanding, especially with multiplication in Problem Q)
  - C=30% (misunderstanding of both operations)
  - D=20% (correct understanding, which is rare at this level)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with applying the order of operations consistently.
  - A=15% (less likely to ignore basic rules)
  - B=10% (some recognition of operation precedence)
  - C=20% (misapplication of rules)
  - D=55% (growing understanding of correct precedence)

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of mathematical concepts, including the order of operations.
  - A=5% (unlikely to make basic mistakes)
  - B=5% (similarly unlikely)
  - C=10% (occasional lapses in understanding)
  - D=80% (strong understanding of correct order)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only know the order of operations but can apply it in complex situations.
  - A=0% (unlikely to consider incorrect orders)
  - B=0% (similarly, correct identification for Q)
  - C=0% (misunderstandings are rare)
  - D=100% (accurate application of order of operations)

The best answer is B.
