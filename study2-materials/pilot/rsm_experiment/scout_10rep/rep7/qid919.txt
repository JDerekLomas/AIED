## Step 1: Understanding the equation and the task
The equation given is $y = 3x^2$, and we need to find the value of $y$ when $x = 0.3$. The correct calculation is $y = 3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

## 2: Analyzing the wrong answers
To determine the errors leading to each wrong answer, let's analyze them:
- A) $0.81$: This would result from $3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.27$, but if a student mistakenly calculated it as $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then squared or directly multiplied by 3, they might get confused, but directly it seems like $0.9^2 = 0.81$. However, a likely error is to calculate $(0.3)^2 = 0.09$, then $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ not leading to 0.81 directly but indicative of miscalculation.
   - Actually, $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$ then mistaken for $0.9$ or error in order of operations.
- B) $0.27$: This is the correct answer, calculated as $3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.
- C) $1.8$: A possible error here could involve not squaring $0.3$, so $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and mistakenly doubling it or misinterpreting the operation as $3^2 \times 0.3$ which does not lead directly to 1.8 but shows confusion.
- D) $2.7$: A likely error to arrive at $2.7$ could be $3 \times 0.3 \times 3 = 2.7$, or more so, simple error in which student sees just multiplying by 3 and taking .9 * 3.

However the star errors relate in following form:
## Step 3: Correct Analysis
- A) $0.81$: A mistake such as $(0.3)^2 = 0.9$ then $3 \times 0.9$. This shows error since if you thought .3*\3 for eg,
was step not shown 
.  
The error relates more so; 

 A more fitting A thus arises - squaring to .09, however a value taken mistaken.  
Thus misinterpres,
eg  A9x3 

b direct  

3*(03x09)=2. A7*

## 4: Accurate Description
