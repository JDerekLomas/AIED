## Error Analysis:

A) To arrive at \( p = 0.5 \), a student might incorrectly multiply both sides of the equation by \( p \) to get \( 10p = 5 \), and then divide both sides by 10, resulting in \( p = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \). This error involves incorrect manipulation of the equation.

B) For \( p = 50 \), a student correctly multiplies both sides by \( p \) to get \( 10p = 5 \), but then incorrectly divides both sides by 5 instead of 10, getting \( p = \frac{5}{10} \) but mistakenly calculating it as \( p = 50 \) possibly due to a miscalculation or incorrect handling of the fraction \( \frac{5}{10} \).

C) To get \( p = 2 \), a student might correctly multiply both sides by \( p \) to get \( 10p = 5 \), and then correctly divide both sides by 10, but make a calculation error, \( p = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \) which they might confuse with 2 due to oversight or miscalculation.

D) For "There are no solutions", a student might believe that the equation \( 10 = \frac{5}{p} \) has no solution possibly because they think that \( p \) cannot be a fraction or they misinterpret the equation's solvability. More likely, it stems from not being able to solve the equation properly.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students may struggle significantly with algebraic manipulations and conceptual understanding.
  - A=30% (simple mistake, direct division)
  - B=20% (incorrect handling of numbers)
  - C=20% (miscalculation or confusion)
  - D=30% (lack of understanding or procedural skills)

- **Basic:** Students here have foundational understanding but may still struggle with details.
  - A=15% (careless manipulation)
  - B=10% (miscalculation)
  - C=25% (simple algebraic mistakes)
  - D=50% (still some confusion but more aligned with correct processes)

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts but may make minor errors.
  - A=5% (very careless mistake)
  - B=5% (division or calculation error)
  - C=10% (miscalculation of simple division)
  - D=80% (recognize equation has a solution, unlikely to say no solution)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly competent and make few errors.
  - A=0% (highly unlikely, clear understanding)
  - B=0% (basic calculation accurate)
  - C=5% (only minor lapses)
  - D=95% (easily see the solution exists)

The best answer is B.
