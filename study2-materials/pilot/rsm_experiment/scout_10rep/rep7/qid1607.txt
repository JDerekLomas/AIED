## Step 1: Analyze the given equation and Isaac's steps
The given equation is \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \( k \), we first multiply both sides by 4 to get \( 60 = 1 + k \). Then, we subtract 1 from both sides to get \( 59 = k \).

## 2: Evaluate Isaac's steps for correctness
Isaac's Step 1: \( 60=1+k \) is correct because multiplying both sides of the original equation by 4 yields this result.
Isaac's Step 2: \( 61=k \) is incorrect because subtracting 1 from both sides of \( 60 = 1 + k \) gives \( 59 = k \), not \( 61 = k \).

## 3: Identify the errors leading to each wrong answer
Error Analysis:
A) A student might choose A if they think Step 1 is correct but do not verify Step 2, or they believe Step 2 is incorrect without understanding why.
B) A student might choose B if they incorrectly verify Step 1 and Step 2, thinking both are individually correct but not checking their consistency.
C) A student might choose C if they incorrectly believe both steps are mathematically correct, not realizing the mistake in Step 2.
D) A student might choose D if they understand that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect, or if they see both steps are not correct in the context of solving for \( k \).

## 4: Specific errors for each option
- A: Believing only Step 1 is correct implies acknowledging the multiplication step but not checking the subsequent step.
- B: Choosing B suggests a student thinks Step 2 is correct in isolation or made a calculation mistake.
- C: Selecting C indicates a misunderstanding of algebraic manipulation, specifically the error in Step 2.
- D: Picking D shows an understanding that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is not, or both are flawed in the context of the solution.

## 5: Predict the response distribution based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might choose A (20%), B (25%), C (15%), or D (40%) based on a lack of understanding of the steps involved.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may make simple arithmetic mistakes. They could choose A (15%), B (20%), C (10%), or D (55%).
- **Proficient**: Students who are proficient in algebra will likely see the correctness of Step 1 and the error in Step 2, so they might choose A (5%), B (5%), C (5%), or D (85%).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will quickly identify the mistake in Step 2 and understand the algebraic process, likely choosing D (95%), with small percentages possibly choosing A, B, or C due to oversight or to verify understanding.

## 6: Provide the predictions in the required format
Error Analysis:
A) A student believes only Step 1 is correct, not verifying Step 2.
B) A student thinks Step 2 is correct without properly checking.
C) A student incorrectly believes both steps are correct.
D) A student sees that both steps are not correct or that only Step 1 is correct and Step 2 is flawed.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=10% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=2% D=95%
