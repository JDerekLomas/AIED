## Step 1: Understand the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

## 2: Derive the formula for the radius of a sphere
To find the radius \(r\) in terms of \(V\), we rearrange the formula:
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
\[r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\]
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]

## 3: Error Analysis for Option A
A) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \)
Error: A student might mistakenly try to solve for \(r\) but incorrectly manipulate the formula, possibly swapping the positions of \(4\pi\) and \(3\) and also misplacing \(\pi\), leading to this answer.

## 4: Error Analysis for Option B
B) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \)
Error: This could result from a student misinterpreting the formula and omitting \(\pi\) from the numerator or incorrectly placing it in the denominator, indicating a confusion with the formula.

## 5: Error Analysis for Option C
C) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \)
Error: This is actually the correct answer. A student choosing another option might be making a calculation mistake.

## 6: Error Analysis for Option D
D) \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \)
Error: A student might mistakenly factor out or incorrectly apply the cubic root and the constants, leading to a form that does not correctly represent the solution.

## 7: Predictions
Given the correct formula and common errors:
- **Below Basic**: Students might not fully understand the formula or how to solve for \(r\). They might guess or apply incorrect operations. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 25\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 45\%\)
- **Basic**: Students have a grasp of the formula but might make simple algebraic mistakes. \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 60\%\), \(D = 10\%\)
- **Proficient**: Students understand the formula and can solve for \(r\) correctly but might still make occasional errors. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 80\%\), \(D = 5\%\)
- **Advanced**: Students are highly accurate and understand the concept well. \(A = 2\%\), \(B = 3\%\), \(C = 95\%\), \(D = 0\%\)

The final answer is: 

Error Analysis:
A) A student might mistakenly try to solve for \(r\) but incorrectly manipulate the formula.
B) A student might misinterpret the formula and omit \(\pi\) from the numerator.
C) This is the correct answer.
D) A student might mistakenly factor out or incorrectly apply the cubic root.
