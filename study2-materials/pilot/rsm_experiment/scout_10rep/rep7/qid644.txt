## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks Molly to multiply the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\).

## 2: Calculate the correct answer
To find the correct answer, we multiply \(-1\) by \(-4\), which gives \(4\). So, the correct answer is \(+4\), option A.

## 3: Analyze errors for each wrong answer
A) This is the correct answer, so no error is made here. Students who understand multiplying negative numbers will choose this.
B) \( -4 \): A student might choose this if they forget that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result, so they simply multiply \(-1 \times -4 = -4\), ignoring the sign rule.
C) \( +5 \): This could be chosen if a student mistakenly adds \(1 + 4 = 5\) or makes a calculation error unrelated to the signs, such as thinking \(-1 \times -4 = 5\), which doesn't follow standard arithmetic rules.
D) \( -5 \): This might be chosen by a student who incorrectly applies the multiplication of negatives rule or makes a calculation mistake, such as \(-1 \times 4 = -4\) and then incorrectly adjusts.

## 4: Detailed error analysis for wrong choices
A) [No error, correct choice]
B) A student would choose B if they incorrectly remembered or applied the rule for multiplying negative numbers, thinking \(-1 \times -4 = -4\).
C) Choosing C could result from a miscalculation or misunderstanding of basic arithmetic operations, such as confusing the product with a sum or another operation.
D) For D, a possible error could be misinterpreting the numbers or incorrectly calculating, possibly considering one of the terms as \(-5\) or incorrectly adjusting signs.

## 5: Predictions based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and the rules for multiplying negative numbers. They might randomly select or choose based on superficial understanding.
- **Basic**: Students here understand basic operations but may apply rules inconsistently.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the operations and can apply them accurately but might still make occasional mistakes under pressure.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are confident in their understanding and application of mathematical rules.

## 6: Making predictions
Given the nature of the question:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some get it right by chance or basic understanding), B=30% (apply wrong sign rule), C=20% (miscalculation), D=30% (another miscalculation).
- **Basic**: A=60%, B=20% (some still struggle with negative number multiplication), C=5%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=90%, B=5%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) No error, correct calculation of $-1 \times -4 = 4$.
B) Incorrectly applying the multiplication rule for negative numbers, resulting in $-1 \times -4 = -4$.
C) Miscalculation or incorrect operation, such as adding instead of multiplying.
D) Incorrect calculation or misinterpretation of numbers.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
