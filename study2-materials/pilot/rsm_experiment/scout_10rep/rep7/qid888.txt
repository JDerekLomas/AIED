## Step 1: Error Analysis for Option A
To arrive at \( m^{2}-2 m-35 \), a student might incorrectly apply the distributive property (also known as FOIL for binomials) but make a mistake in combining the terms. The correct application of FOIL is: \( (m-5)(m-7) = m*m - m*7 - 5*m + (-5)*(-7) = m^{2} - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^{2} - 12m + 35 \). A student choosing A might have calculated the product as \( m^{2} - 7m - 5m - 35 \) (incorrectly adding the constants or misinterpreting the signs), which results in \( m^{2} - 12m - 35 \), but let's assume a simple error like not multiplying the constants correctly or adding/subtracting incorrectly could lead to various wrong answers.

## 2: Error Analysis for Option B
The correct answer is indeed \( m^{2} - 12m + 35 \), which does not require an error analysis as it's the correct result of \( (m-5)(m-7) = m^{2} - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^{2} - 12m + 35 \).

## 3: Error Analysis for Option C
For \( m^{2} + 12m + 35 \), a student might incorrectly apply the signs during the multiplication, perhaps thinking \( (m-5)(m-7) = m^{2} + 7m + 5m + 35 = m^{2} + 12m + 35 \), mistakenly adding the middle terms instead of subtracting, which shows confusion with the signs of the numbers being multiplied.

## 4: Error Analysis for Option D
To get \( m^{2} - 12m - 35 \), a student might correctly multiply out the terms as \( m^{2} - 7m - 5m + 35 \) but then incorrectly subtract 35 instead of adding it, resulting in \( m^{2} - 12m - 35 \). Alternatively, this could come from misinterpreting the signs entirely.

## 5: Predictions for below_basic
At the below_basic level, students might struggle significantly with applying FOIL or understanding negative numbers. Thus, incorrect sign applications or simple arithmetic mistakes are common.
- A: 20% (guessing, simple mistakes)
- B: 10% ( might recognize the correct method but mess up)
- C: 30% (misapplication of signs)
- D: 40% (similar to C, misinterpretation)

## 6: Predictions for basic
At the basic level, students have a grasp of FOIL but might not apply it accurately or make arithmetic errors.
- A: 15% (simple oversight in calculation)
- B: 60% (correct understanding, minor mistakes in arithmetic)
- C: 15% (confusion with signs)
- D: 10% (incorrect constant term)

## 7: Predictions for proficient
At the proficient level, students understand FOIL and are less likely to make basic arithmetic errors.
- A: 5% (overlooking a term or small mistake)
- B: 80% (correct application of FOIL)
- C: 10% (distraction leading to sign error)
- D: 5% (error in constant)

## 8: Predictions for advanced
At the advanced level, students not only apply FOIL accurately but are also less prone to minor errors.
- A: 2% (minor lapse)
- B: 90% (accurate application)
- C: 5% (unlikely but possible under distraction)
- D: 3% (considering alternatives)

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might incorrectly apply the distributive property and end up with an answer that seems close but has incorrect coefficients or constant term, possibly not multiplying the constants correctly.
B) No error, correct application of FOIL.
C) A student might mistakenly add the middle terms instead of subtracting, confusing the signs.
D) A student could mistakenly subtract the constant term instead of adding it.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%
