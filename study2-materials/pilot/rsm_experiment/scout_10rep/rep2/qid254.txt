## Error Analysis:

A) To choose A, a student would ignore the 0 in the dataset and calculate the mean as if the dataset were 1, 3, 4, 7. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the definition of mean, specifically neglecting to include all data points in the calculation.

B) Choosing B suggests a student would mistakenly think that adding the numbers and then dividing by 5 is the correct order of operations but fails to use parentheses correctly, implying confusion about operator precedence but not necessarily about the inclusion of all data points.

C) For option C, a student would be excluding the 0 from the sum (which is correct) but also mistakenly think there are only 4 numbers, indicating confusion about how to count the number of data points to calculate the mean.

D) Choosing D would imply a student does not believe any of the given calculations are correct, suggesting they understand the formula for the mean but recognize the errors in A, B, and C.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students may struggle with basic concepts. Option A (ignoring 0) might seem plausible if they misunderstood what numbers to include. Option B could be chosen due to confusion with order of operations without proper calculation. Option C incorrectly counts the data points. Option D might seem reasonable if they know something's wrong but can't articulate it.

  - **Below Basic:** A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%

- **Basic:** Students here have foundational knowledge but might still make errors due to oversight or misunderstandings. They might choose A or C due to confusion about including 0 or counting data points. B might appeal due to operational confusion. D grows more likely as students realize common mistakes.

  - **Basic:** A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%

- **Proficient:** Students at this level understand basic statistical calculations. The error here (for choosing wrong options) might stem from hurried calculations or overlooking details. A and C require noticeable errors in including data points or counting them. B seems clearly incorrect if one checks properly. D might be less likely chosen as they spot the obviously incorrect options.

  - **Proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%

- **Advanced:** This group of students typically comprehends statistical concepts well. However, fatigue or inattention to detail could very minimal possibility for error. D would dominate since any slight mistake made (e.g. missing an operation entirely) could become instantly known to such advanced thinkers causing then option selecting

  - **Advanced:** A=1% B=1% C=2% D=96%

The best answer is D.
