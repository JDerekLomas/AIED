## Step 1: Analyze the equation and the task
The equation given is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\). To solve for \(p\), we need to isolate \(p\) on one side of the equation. This is done by dividing both sides of the equation by 3, yielding \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 2: Error Analysis for each wrong answer
A) \(p = \frac{1}{4}\): A student might arrive at this answer by incorrectly multiplying \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3 instead of dividing, which would give \(\frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\). This indicates a misunderstanding of the operation needed to solve for \(p\).

B) \(p = \frac{1}{36}\): This is the correct answer. However, to analyze potential errors, let's consider what could lead to not choosing this: not multiplying by \(\frac{1}{3}\) or not correctly dividing \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3.

C) \(p = 4\): A student might get this by incorrectly solving the equation as \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) implies \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\), but then mistakenly doing \(12 \div 3 = 4\), ignoring the fraction and possibly thinking of the inverse operation or misinterpreting the division with fractions.

D) \(p = \frac{1}{9}\): This could result from a student mistakenly thinking \(3 \times \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{3}\) or similarly incorrect reasoning, but more likely from confusing the operation or the numbers, such as \((3 \times 3) = 9\) and \(\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{12} \div 4\), not directly applicable but shows flawed logic.

## 3: Correct Error Analysis
A) To choose \(p = \frac{1}{4}\), a student would mistakenly multiply \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3.
B) To choose \(p = \frac{1}{36}\), a student would correctly solve the equation.
C) For \(p = 4\), a student seems to ignore \(\frac{1}{12}\) and incorrectly solves or confuses operations.
D) For \(p = \frac{1}{9}\), there seems to be confusion possibly with ratios or not properly dividing \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3.

## 4: Precise Error Descriptions
A) Multiplying instead of dividing by 3.
B) Correct division by 3.
C) Misinterpreting division with large results or skipping fraction consideration.
D) Possibly a wrong proportion or fraction operation.
