## Step 1: Analyze the correct calculation for the given expression
The correct calculation for \((m-5)(m-7)\) involves multiplying each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket: \(m \times m + m \times -7 - 5 \times m - 5 \times -7\), which simplifies to \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 2: Identify the error for option A
Option A: \(m^2 - 2m - 35\). A student might arrive at this answer by incorrectly multiplying the terms: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35\), but then mistakenly simplifying the middle terms to \(-2m\) instead of \(-12m\).

## 3: Identify the error for option B
Option B: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\). This is actually the correct answer, as derived in Step 1.

## 4: Identify the error for option C
Option C: \(m^2 + 12m + 35\). A student might get this by adding the terms instead of multiplying them correctly: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\), but then incorrectly adding the middle terms to get \(+12m\).

## 5: Identify the error for option D
Option D: \(m^2 - 12m - 35\). A student could arrive at this by forgetting to change the sign of one of the terms during multiplication: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35\), which simplifies correctly to \(m^2 - 12m - 35\) if the student incorrectly keeps the negative sign for both the \(-5 \times -7\) term.

## 6: Prediction for students at different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not even attempt to expand the brackets or make significant errors.
  - A: 30% (simple incorrect calculation)
  - B: 20% (perhaps a guess or a very astute incorrect calculation)
  - C: 20% (completely incorrect, possibly adding instead of multiplying)
  - D: 30% (another form of incorrect calculation)

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but may make careless mistakes.
  - A: 20% (common error, like miscalculating the middle term)
  - B: 40% (correct answer, showing understanding)
  - C: 15% (adding instead of subtracting)
  - D: 25% (another mistake, possibly with signs)

- **Proficient**: Students who are proficient in algebra should be able to expand brackets accurately.
  - A: 5% (minor careless mistake)
  - B: 80% (correct expansion)
  - C: 5% (unlikely but could happen with distraction)
  - D: 10% (could happen with another type of mistake)

- **Advanced**: These students are likely to have a deep understanding and rarely make mistakes.
  - A: 0% (unlikely error for advanced students)
  - B: 95% (confidently get the correct answer)
  - C: 0% (extremely unlikely)
  - D: 5% (only if distracted or made an unusual mistake)

## 7: Translate predictions into requested format
Error Analysis:
A) A student might arrive at \(m^2 - 2m - 35\) by incorrectly simplifying the middle terms.
B) This is the correct calculation: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).
C) A student arriving at \(m^2 + 12m + 35\) likely added the middle terms.
D) A student getting \(m^2 - 12m - 35\) might have incorrectly handled the signs.

Predictions:
