## Step 1: Understand the given problem and what is being asked.
The problem provides a table of values for the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) and asks to find the value that should replace the star (\(\bigstar\)) when \(x = 0\). We need to analyze potential errors leading to incorrect answers and predict the percentage of students at different ability levels who might choose each option.

## 2: Solve the equation for \(y\) when \(x = 0\) to find the correct answer.
Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\):
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]
\[y = 5\]
So, the correct answer is \(y = 5\), which corresponds to option C.

## 3: Analyze the error leading to each incorrect answer.
A) \(20\): A student might arrive at this answer by incorrectly substituting \(x = 0\) and then solving for \(y\) as if the equation was \(4x + 2y = 10x\) or another incorrect manipulation, but more likely by setting \(x=0\) and \(y=0\) and then trying to solve it as \(2y = 10 - 4x\) which results in an incorrect process. However, a straightforward mistake could be solving \(4*0 + 2y = 10*2\) or similar wrong manipulation. Specifically, \(2y = 10 * 2 = 20\), thus \(y = 20 / 2 = 10\) seems not directly related, a possible direct error could \(4*5 +2y = 10\) resulting in \(y = - 10\), another possibility \(10 = 4*0 + 2y\) implies \(y= 10/2 = 5*2 =10\) seems unrelated but
misinterpreting and recalculating \(2y= 40\) that leads to \(y= 20\).

B) \(3\): This could happen if a student incorrectly solves the equation or uses a wrong value for \(x\) or \(y\). For example, they might try \(4*1 + 2y = 10\), getting \(2y = 6\) and \(y = 3\), mistakenly using \(x=1\) instead of \(x=0\).

C) \(5\): This is the correct answer, as found in Step 2.

D) \(2.5\): A student might choose this if they mistakenly solve the equation or use incorrect values. For instance, plugging in \(x=2\) instead of \(x=0\): \(4*2 + 2y = 10\), \(8 + 2y = 10\), \(2y = 2\), \(y = 1\), seems not directly related but if \(x=1\) then \(4 +2y = 10\) then \(2y= 6\) so \(y= 3\) does not get 2.5.

Precise calculation mistake to D would imply they substituted values: given 
\[4*(some) + 2*y 
with possible manipulation and recalculation leads 

If they set on \(x= 3\), where, then,  \(12 +2y = 10, which~ then~ would~ leads
 to: 2y=-2;  \(y = -1.

Error Analysis:
A) A student might arrive at 20 by grossly misinterpreting or incorrect algebraic manipulation, for example. e.g setting the number \(x^2\).
