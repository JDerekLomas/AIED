## Step 1: Analyze the given equation and Isaac's steps.
The given equation is \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \). Isaac's steps are:
Step \( 1: \) \( 60=1+k \)
Step \( 2: \) \( 61=k \)

## 2: Verify Isaac's steps.
To verify, we solve the equation properly:
\( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \)
Multiplying both sides by 4 gives:
\( 60=1+k \)
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:
\( 59=k \)

## 3: Identify the errors in Isaac's steps.
Step 1 is correct as \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) and \( 60 = 1 + k \) is a correct manipulation.
Step 2 is incorrect because if \( 60 = 1 + k \), then \( k = 60 - 1 = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 4: Error Analysis for each option.
A) Only step 1: A student might choose this if they see Step 1 as correct but do not verify Step 2, or they understand Step 2 is incorrect.
B) Only step 2: This would be chosen if a student incorrectly verifies Step 2 without checking Step 1 or believes Step 2's result is correct regardless of Step 1's accuracy.
C) Both steps are correct: This would be chosen by a student who incorrectly believes both steps are mathematically valid.
D) Both steps are incorrect: This option would be chosen by a student who correctly identifies that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect, or they understand both steps' validity.

## 5: Detailed Error Analysis.
A) A student chooses A if they correctly solve Step 1 but fail to notice the mistake in Step 2 or do not proceed to evaluate Step 2's correctness.
B) Choosing B implies a student thinks Step 2 is correct (\( k = 61 \)) without properly checking, likely due to a miscalculation or not following through with the algebra.
C) A student chooses C if they are mistaken about the outcome of both steps, not realizing that while Step 1 is a correct operation, Step 2 yields an incorrect value for \( k \).
D) A student chooses D if they recognize both steps cannot be correct given the known solution (\( k = 59 \)), indicating an understanding that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is not.

## 6: Predictions based on student ability levels.
- Below Basic: \( A=30\% \) (some understanding but flawed), \( B=40\% \) (misunderstands the process), \( C=10\% \) (lacking basic skills), \( D=20\% \) (some critical thinking).
- Basic: \( A=20\% \) (improved but still errors), \( B=30\% \) (common mistake), \( C=5\% \) ( rarely holds both correct), \( D=45\% \) (better critical thinking).
- Proficient: \( A=10\% \) (occasional lapses), \( B=15\% \) (errors due to haste), \( C=5\% \) (rarely both correct), \( D=70\% \) (understands process).
- Advanced: \( A=5\% \) (rarely mistaken), \( B=5\% \) (precision matters), \( C=0\% \) (know steps invalid), \( D=90\% \) (strong understanding).

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student sees Step 1 as correct but Step 2 as incorrect.
B) A student thinks only Step 2 is correct, ignoring the validity of Step 1.
C) A student mistakenly believes both steps are correct.
D) A student recognizes both steps are not correct or incorrectly so.
