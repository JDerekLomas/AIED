## Step 1: Understand the question and the task
The task is to analyze the specific calculation error or misconception that leads to each wrong answer in a multiple-choice question about multiplying two terms from the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), and then predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option.

## 2: Identify the correct calculation
The correct calculation for the terms indicated by the arrows, \(-1\) from the first bracket and \(-4\) from the second bracket, is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## 3: Analyze errors for each wrong answer
A) \( +4 \): This is actually the correct answer, but let's assume a student might get confused and think this is an option without calculating, or they might have calculated correctly but chosen the wrong option due to other mistakes in their work.
B) \( -4 \): A student might choose this if they forgot that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result, or if they incorrectly applied the sign rules.
C) \( +5 \): This could result from a student misinterpreting the numbers being multiplied or making a calculation error, such as \((-1) \times (-4) = 5\), which could stem from a misunderstanding of multiplication facts or careless error.
D) \( -5 \): Similarly, a student might choose this if they incorrectly applied the multiplication of negative numbers or made a simple arithmetic mistake.

## 4: Detailed error analysis for each option
A) To choose \(+4\), a student would actually have to have done the calculation correctly but perhaps was distracted or made a simple mistake in selecting the answer.
B) For \( -4 \), a student would likely have forgotten that two negatives make a positive.
C) For \( +5 \), a student might have misread the numbers or incorrectly calculated the product.
D) For \( -5 \), a student likely misunderstood the rule for multiplying negative numbers.

## 5: Predict response distribution
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below_basic**: Students might not understand the concept of multiplying negative numbers or might make basic arithmetic errors. So, they might be more likely to choose incorrect options due to lack of understanding. 
- **Basic**: Students here might have some understanding but are prone to simple errors. 
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand the concept but might make minor errors under pressure.
- **Advanced**: These students are less likely to make errors.

## 6: Specific predictions
- A) \( +4 \) (Correct answer), so we expect a higher percentage of advanced and proficient students to get it right or choose it.
- B) \( -4 \) could be chosen by those who haven't mastered the multiplication of negatives.
- C) \( +5 \) and D) \( -5 \) seem less likely as they involve more significant errors.

## 7: Final predictions
Given the errors and student ability levels:
- **Below_basic**: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
- **Basic**: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student would have done the calculation correctly but perhaps was distracted or made a simple mistake in selecting the answer.
B) A student likely forgot that two negatives make a positive.
C) A student might have misread the numbers or incorrectly calculated the product, thinking of a wrong multiplication fact.
D) A student likely misunderstood the rule for multiplying negative numbers.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
