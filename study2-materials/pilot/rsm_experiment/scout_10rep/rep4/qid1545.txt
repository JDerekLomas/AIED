## Error Analysis:
A) To choose A (\(>\)), a student might incorrectly evaluate \(8 + 12 \div 4\) as \(20 \div 4 = 5\) and \((8+12) \div 4\) as \(20 \div 4 = 5\), but then mistakenly think that because \(8+12\) equals \(20\), adding \(12 \div 4\) to \(8\) gives a greater value before division, or simply evaluate expressions from left to right without applying Order of Operations correctly, resulting in \(8 + 3 = 11\) for the left side and \(5\) for the right, incorrectly concluding \(11 > 5\).

B) For B (\(<\)), a student may apply the Order of Operations correctly but then misinterpret the results. If they calculate \(8 + 12 \div 4 = 8 + 3 = 11\) and \((8+12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5\), they might see \(11\) is indeed greater than \(5\), but choose \(B\) due to calculation errors or a slip in comparing the numbers.

C) For C (\(=\)), a student would need to mistakenly apply the same operation to both parts or misunderstand the operations entirely. Calculating both sides as \(8 + 12 \div 4 = 11\) and \((8+12) \div 4 = 5\) leads to choosing C if they then incorrectly adjust or evaluate one side to equal the other.

D) For D (\(\geq\)), a student might pick this if they see that one expression could be equal or greater but due to errors in calculation don't accurately reflect on which is strictly greater.

## Specific Error Details:
- A is chosen by mistaking the order of operations or simply adding then dividing on the left and only dividing on the right and mistakenly choosing > without accurate calculation.
- B is for those who calculate correctly but might pick the wrong comparison (e.g., choosing < because of errors not leading to A).
- C suggests equal calculation outcome misunderstanding or incorrect use of order operations to make sides seem equal.
- D indicates uncertainty in selection based on a flawed approach to Order of Operations.

## Predictions:
To predict accurately requires statistical data or classroom experience. However, typically:
- **Below Basic**: Lacks understanding of Order of Operations. 
  - A=20% (assuming calculation errors lead here),
  - B=20% (comparisons made on misunderstood calculation or incomplete one-side evaluation), 
  - C=40% (since not comprehending Order of Operations leads to seeming equivalence), and 
  - D=20% (those on an almost accurate cusp pick symbols mistakenly).
  
- **Basic**: Beginning understanding; might miss precise handling.
  - A=40%,
  - B=35%,
  - C=15% (some manage to equate mistakenly with very partial operation realization),
  - D=10%.

- **Proficient**: Applying understanding of maths concepts largely properly; errors are isolated mistakes.
  - A=0% (rarely to choose purely > through calculation mistakes from familiar expressions), 
  - B=70% (precise assessment reveals lesser through correct operational order evaluation; realize >, don confusion misplace here mistaken < selection still; B here dominates properly),
  - C=25% (small segment with errors leading equality or >|B symbol, 
     understanding applied > then > here here mis),
  - D=5% largely because these perform correctly largely in assessments to evaluate real).

## Final assessment given statistical predictions with understanding on Order of Operqation knowledge 
## and prediction best understanding on symbol selections through assessments.



The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
