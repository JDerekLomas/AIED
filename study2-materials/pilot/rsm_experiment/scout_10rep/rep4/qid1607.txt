## Step 1: Analyze the given equation and Isaac's steps.
The given equation is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \( k \), we first multiply both sides by 4 to get \( 60 = 1 + k \). Then, we subtract 1 from both sides to get \( 59 = k \). Isaac's steps are: Step \( 1: 60 = 1 + k \) and Step \( 2: 61 = k \).

## 2: Evaluate Isaac's steps for correctness.
- Step 1 is correct because multiplying both sides of the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \) by 4 indeed yields \( 60 = 1 + k \).
- Step 2 is incorrect because subtracting 1 from \( 60 = 1 + k \) gives \( 59 = k \), not \( 61 = k \).

## 3: Identify the specific errors leading to each wrong answer.
Error Analysis:
A) To choose A, a student would reason that Step 1 is correct but fail to check the validity of Step 2, or not understand that Step 2 is incorrect.
B) To choose B, a student would incorrectly believe Step 2 is correct in isolation or not notice the error in Step 2.
C) To choose C, a student would incorrectly assume both steps are correct, not catching the mistake in Step 2.
D) To choose D, a student would correctly identify that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect, or understand that both steps cannot be correct given the mistake in Step 2.

## 4: Predict the response distribution based on student ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulations. They might choose A or B due to partial understanding or choose D out of frustration or lack of understanding. The prediction is:
  - A = 20% (some understanding of Step 1)
  - B = 30% (mistake in Step 2 not recognized)
  - C = 10% (completely misinformed)
  - D = 40% (recognize an issue but not specify)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are likely to recognize the correctness of Step 1 but struggle with validating Step 2.
  - A = 30%
  - B = 25%
  - C = 15%
  - D = 30%

- **Proficient:** These students understand algebraic steps and can identify mistakes. They should see Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect.
  - A = 10%
  - B = 5%
  - C = 5%
  - D = 80%

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the algebra but can also critically evaluate the steps given. They will easily spot the error in Step 2.
  - A = 5%
  - B = 0%
  - C = 0%
  - D = 95%

The final answer is: 

Error Analysis:
A) A student would reason that Step 1 is correct but fail to check the validity of Step 2.
B) A student would incorrectly believe Step 2 is correct in isolation.
C) A student would incorrectly assume both steps are correct.
D) A student would correctly identify that Step 2 is incorrect.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
