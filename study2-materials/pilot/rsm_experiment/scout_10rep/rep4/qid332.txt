## Error Analysis:

A) To choose option A, a student would incorrectly believe that only Tom's suggestion is valid, and Katie's suggestion is wrong. This might stem from not checking Katie's suggestion properly or not understanding how to isolate \(x\) correctly in Katie's proposed step.

B) For option B, a student would think Katie is correct but Tom is not. This error could occur if a student incorrectly validates Katie's step but fails to see the correctness of Tom's step, or misunderstands the algebraic process.

C) Choosing option C would be correct if a student understands and can verify both Tom's and Katie's suggested steps as correct. This shows a good grasp of solving linear equations.

D) Selecting option D indicates a student believes neither Tom nor Katie is correct. This could happen if a student incorrectly applies algebraic rules to both suggestions and finds fault in both, possibly due to a misconception about how to solve for \(x\).

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. 
  - A: **40%** (blindly accepting Tom without checking)
  - B: **30%** (misunderstanding Katie's step)
  - C: **10%** (correct but unlikely given the struggles)
  - D: **20%** (rejecting both due to confusion)

- **Basic:** Students have a foundational understanding but may make careless mistakes.
  - A: **25%** (familiar with Tom's but not Katie's)
  - B: **20%** (sees Katie's as right but not Tom's)
  - C: **40%** (understands both are correct)
  - D: **15%** (still a bit confused)

- **Proficient:** These students are confident in their algebraic manipulations.
  - A: **10%** ( might see only Tom's as obviously correct)
  - B: **5%** (less likely to misunderstand)
  - C: **80%** (recognize both as correct steps)
  - D: **5%** (highly unlikely to reject both)

- **Advanced:** This group would easily recognize the correct procedures.
  - A: **0%** (unlikely to only see Tom)
  - B: **0%** (equally unlikely to only see Katie)
  - C: **95%** (strong understanding to see both are valid)
  - D: **5%** (for those who may second-guess themselves)

The best answer is A.
