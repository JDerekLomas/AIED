## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the task
The equation given is $10x - 6y = 30$. We need to find the value of $x$ when $y = 0.5$.

## 2: Solve the equation for $x$ when $y = 0.5$
Substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$.
Simplify:
$10x - 3 = 30$.
Add 3 to both sides:
$10x = 33$.
Divide by 10:
$x = 3.3$.

## 3: Analyze the error for each wrong answer
A) To arrive at $4.25$, a student might incorrectly solve the equation or use wrong values. For instance, if they mistakenly used $10x + 6y = 30$ or made a calculation error like $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$ leading to $10x - 3 = 30$ but then incorrectly solved it as $10x = 30 + 6(0.5) = 30 + 3 = 33$ and then divided wrongly or miscalculated.

B) For $-4.25$, a possible error could be mistakenly solving the equation as $10x = 30 - 6y$ but then not substituting $y$ correctly or making a sign error: $10x - 6(-0.5) = 30$ which simplifies to $10x + 3 = 30$, then $10x = 27$, and $x = 2.7$. Alternatively, a straightforward mistake could be not properly substituting $y = 0.5$ and solving, perhaps incorrectly assuming a negative value for $x$ without basis.

C) The correct answer is $3.3$, so choosing $3.3$ would actually be correct, not an error.

D) For $2.7$, a possible mistake could involve incorrect substitution or arithmetic, for example, mistakenly doing $10x - 6y = 30$ becomes $10x - 3 = 23$ (perhaps they thought $30 - 7 = 23$), leading to $10x = 26$ and thus $x = 2.6$, close but not exactly $2.7$.

## 4: Specific error analysis
A) A student might add $6y$ instead of subtracting, or make a calculation mistake such as $33/10 = 3.3$ but then round or miscalculate to $4.25$.
B) A student might mistakenly use $y = -0.5$ instead of $0.5$, leading to $10x - 6(-0.5) = 30$, then $10x + 3 = 30$, $10x = 27$, $x = 2.7$.
C) Correct calculation leads to $3.3$.
D) A miscalculation such as using wrong numbers or misplacing decimals.

## 5: Detail error for A
A) If a student thinks $10x = 30 + 6*0.5*2 = 30 + 6 = 36$ because they incorrectly doubled $y$'s coefficient or miscalculated, then $x = 36/10*2 = 3.6*2 = 7.2/2 = 3.6$ they do not get $4.25$ this way directly. Let's correct it:
For A ($4.25$), the equation was $10x = 42.5$ (perhaps from mistaking operations), then dividing gives $4.25$.

## 6: Predicted response distribution
Given typical understanding and common mistakes:
- below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50% (these students are likely to guess or make basic errors)
- basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10% (students with basic understanding might get the correct answer or make simple mistakes)
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10% (proficient students are more likely to get it right or make minimal errors)
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5% (advanced students are expected to answer correctly with high accuracy)

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) Incorrectly solving the equation, possibly using $10x = 42.5$ yields $x = 4.25$.
B) Mistakenly solving with incorrect signs or values, such as assuming $y$ is negative.
C) Correct calculation.
D) Miscalculation, possibly using incorrect values for $x$ or $y$.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
