## Step 1: Understand the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

## 2: Solve the volume formula for \(r\)
To find the radius \(r\) in terms of \(V\), we rearrange the formula:
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
Multiplying both sides by \(\frac{3}{4\pi}\):
\[r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\]
Taking the cube root of both sides:
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]

## 3: Error Analysis for each wrong answer
A) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \):
- Error: Swapping the positions of \(4\pi\) and \(3\) and also changing the sign, likely due to confusion in rearranging the formula.

B) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \):
- Error: Incorrectly omitting \(\pi\) from the denominator, suggesting a mistake in recalling the formula or in algebraic manipulation.

C) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \):
- Correct answer, no error.

D) \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \):
- Error: Incorrectly handling the cube root and constants, suggesting a misunderstanding of how to solve for \(r\).

## 4: Predictions
### below_basic
- A: 20% (overconfidence in incorrect derivation)
- B: 25% (simple incorrect manipulation)
- C: 30% (perhaps a guess or partial recall)
- D: 25% (incorrectly applying operations)

### basic
- A: 15% (some understanding but incorrect application)
- B: 20% (common mistake in formula recall)
- C: 40% (correct recall or derivation)
- D: 25% (confusion with algebraic manipulations)

### proficient
- A: 5% (overthinking or careless mistake)
- B: 10% (distraction leading to simple error)
- C: 70% (solid understanding and correct derivation)
- D: 15% (less common misstep)

### advanced
- A: 2% (very rare mistake, likely due to carelessness)
- B: 3% (unusual mistake, perhaps from overthinking)
- C: 90% (strong understanding, accurate derivation)
- D: 5% (exceptional case of misapplication)

The final answer is: 

Error Analysis:
