To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the perspectives provided and relate them to common student understanding and mistakes in mathematics, particularly in the context of multiplying negative numbers.

1. **Understanding of Multiplying Negative Numbers**: The key concept here is that multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number. All the perspectives demonstrate an understanding of this rule, leading to the correct answer being \( +4 \) (Option A).

2. **Student Ability Levels**:
   - **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic rules or make frequent errors. They might not fully grasp the concept of multiplying negative numbers or could be confused by the context of the question.
   - **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make careless mistakes or not apply rules consistently.
   - **Proficient**: These students understand the mathematical rules and can apply them correctly in straightforward contexts like this.
   - **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the rules but can also apply them in more complex situations and have a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts.

Given these levels and the nature of the question:

- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle significantly, potentially leading to a higher chance of selecting incorrect options due to confusion. However, given the simplicity of the question and the direct application of the rule, there might still be a significant percentage choosing the correct answer (A) due to guidance or basic understanding. Let's assume 50% choose A correctly, with the rest split among B, C, and D due to confusion or lack of understanding (e.g., A=50%, B=20%, C=15%, D=15%).
- **Basic**: Students here are more likely to apply the rule correctly but might still make minor errors. A higher percentage would choose A (e.g., A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%).
- **Proficient**: These students should consistently apply the rule correctly, leading to a very high percentage choosing A (e.g., A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%).
- **Advanced**: Similarly, these students would also choose A with a very high confidence level, potentially 100% (e.g., A=100%, B=0%, C=0%, D=0%).

Based on the analysis and typical student performance:

below_basic: A=50% B=20% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
