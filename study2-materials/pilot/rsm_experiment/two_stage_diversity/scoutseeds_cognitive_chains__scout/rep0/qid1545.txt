## Step 1: Analyze the question and the given perspectives
The question requires students to compare two expressions, \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\), and determine which symbol (\(>, <, =, \geq\)) belongs in the box. All perspectives correctly follow the order of operations (BODMAS) and arrive at the conclusion that \(8+12 \div 4 = 11\) and \((8+12) \div 4 = 5\). Since \(11 > 5\), the correct symbol is \(>\).

## 2: Consider student ability levels and potential errors
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the order of operations or simple arithmetic. They might incorrectly calculate the expressions or choose a symbol without calculation.
- **Basic:** Students at this level can follow basic procedures but might make occasional errors. They are likely to calculate the expressions correctly but might choose an incorrect symbol if they're uncertain about the comparison.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level are generally accurate in their calculations and understand the order of operations. They are likely to choose the correct symbol \(>\) but might have a small chance of selecting other options due to careless errors.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly accurate and understand the underlying concepts well. They are very likely to choose the correct symbol \(>\).

## 3: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
- **Below Basic:** These students might not follow the order of operations correctly or might not calculate accurately. There's a higher chance of them selecting an incorrect option. Let's assume:
- A (correct) = 40% (some manage to get it right by chance or simple calculation),
- B = 20% (some might think \(5 > 11\)),
- C = 20% (some might think they are equal),
- D = 20% (some might think it's greater than or equal to).

- **Basic:** These students have a better grasp but can still make errors. Let's assume:
- A = 70% (most get it right but with some errors),
- B = 15% (some confusion about which is larger),
- C = 10% (a few think they are equal),
- D = 5% (a few think it's greater than or equal to).

- **Proficient:** Students here are generally accurate. Let's assume:
- A = 90% (most get it right),
- B = 5% (rare errors in comparison),
- C = 3% (a few might mistakenly think they are equal),
- D = 2% (some might think it's \( \geq \)).

- **Advanced:** These students are highly accurate. Let's assume:
- A = 98% (almost all get it right),
- B = 1% (very rare errors),
- C = 0.5% (very few might think they are equal),
- D = 0.5% (very few might think it's \( \geq \)).

## 4: Convert assumptions into the required format
Given the analysis, here are the estimated percentages:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
