Below Basic (likely to struggle with basic algebra):
- A: 60% (students may identify step 1 as correct through basic multiplication but struggle with subtraction to verify step 2)
- B: 10% (misunderstanding of step 2, not recognizing its incorrectness)
- C: 5% (unlikely to see both as correct given the clear error in step 2)
- D: 25% (may see both steps as incorrect, lacking confidence in algebraic manipulation)

Basic:
- A: 80% (students can follow the multiplication and see step 1 as correct, and some can identify step 2 as incorrect)
- B: 5% (students are less likely to think step 2 is correct alone)
- C: 5% (error in judgment regarding step 2)
- D: 10% (a few might still struggle with identifying correct steps)

Proficient:
- A: 90% (confident in step 1 being correct and can identify the mistake in step 2)
- B: 2% (unlikely to choose step 2 as correct without a good reason)
- C: 2% (highly unlikely to see both steps as correct)
- D: 6% (minor confusion, possibly due to not being fully engaged or re-reading the question)

Advanced:
- A: 95% (strong understanding, easily verifying step 1 and debunking step 2)
- B: 1% (extremely unlikely to consider step 2 correct without other factors)
- C: 1% (no chance of seeing both steps as correct given clear mathematical verification)
- D: 3% (rare instances where a student may overlook verification steps)
