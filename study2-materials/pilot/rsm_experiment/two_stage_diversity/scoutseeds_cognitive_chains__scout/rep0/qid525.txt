To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the responses based on common mistakes and understanding of fractions and mixed numbers.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the sum of \( 2 \frac{7}{10} \) and \( 2 \frac{1}{4} \) to be left as a mixed number.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Answer
The correct process involves converting the mixed numbers to improper fractions, finding a common denominator, adding them, and then converting back to a mixed number. The correct answer, as derived from all perspectives, is \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \), which corresponds to option B.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Mistakes
- Option A, \( \frac{99}{20} \), is the improper fraction result of the addition, which some students might not convert back to a mixed number.
- Option C, \( \frac{99}{40} \), could result from incorrect handling of fractions or finding a common denominator.
- Option D, \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \), seems to result from incorrect simplification or conversion.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with converting mixed numbers to improper fractions, finding common denominators, or converting back to mixed numbers. They might be more likely to choose incorrect options due to lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might make simple mistakes. They are more likely to get the correct answer but could be tempted by obviously incorrect options.
- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid understanding and are less likely to make careless mistakes. They should predominantly choose the correct answer.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the process but can also apply it accurately and efficiently. They are likely to choose the correct answer and might be more critical of their own work.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Given the complexity of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (not converting back), B=40% (some understanding but inconsistent), C=20% (misunderstanding of denominators), D=10% (random or incorrect simplification).
- **Basic**: A=20% (forget to convert back), B=60% (mostly correct), C=10% (some confusion with fractions), D=10% (minor calculation errors).
- **Proficient**: A=10% (rarely forget conversion), B=80% (consistent correct answers), C=5% (occasional minor errors), D=5% (unlikely but possible mistake).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (unlikely), B=90% (very confident in their answer), C=3% (unlikely mistake), D=2% (rare error).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
