## Step 1: Analyze the Question and Options
The question asks for the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \). The correct answer is \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which corresponds to option A.

## 2: Consider Student Understanding at Different Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic notation and operations. They might confuse the division with addition or subtraction, or misinterpret the order of operations.

## 3: Predict Student Choices for Each Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: These students might choose B, C, or D due to misunderstanding of algebraic conventions. Let's assume a distribution where A is chosen by 20% (as they might get it through luck or basic understanding), B by 30% (confusing with an addition scenario), C by 30% (misunderstanding division and addition), and D by 20% (reciprocal mistake).

## 4: Continue Predicting for Other Levels
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make simple mistakes. They are more likely to choose A but might consider B or C. Assume A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.

## 5: Further Predictions
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebra well and are less likely to make mistakes. Expect a high percentage to choose A. Assume A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.

## 6: Final Predictions
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and are unlikely to make errors. Assume A=98%, B=1%, C=1%, D=0%.

## 7: Convert Predictions to Requested Format
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
- **basic**: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- **advanced**: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
