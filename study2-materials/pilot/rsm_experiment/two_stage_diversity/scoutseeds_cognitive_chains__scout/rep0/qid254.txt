To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's consider the common misunderstandings and correct understanding of calculating the mean.

## Step 1: Understanding the Mean Calculation
The mean of a set of numbers is calculated by adding all the numbers together and then dividing by the count of the numbers. For the given set \(0, 1, 3, 4, 7\), the correct calculation is \(\frac{0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7}{5}\).

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \(\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}\). This option is missing the \(0\) from the addition but correctly divides by \(5\), which matches the number of values. Students might overlook the \(0\) or assume it's negligible.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \(0+1+3+4+7 \div 5\). This option suggests adding all the numbers but then implies dividing only the \(7\) by \(5\) due to the order of operations (or lack thereof). This is a common mistake.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \(\frac{1+3+4+7}{4}\). This option not only misses the \(0\) but also incorrectly states there are \(4\) numbers instead of \(5\).

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D is "None of them". Students would choose this if they realize the mistakes in the other options.

## 6: Ability Level Considerations
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of mean. They are more likely to choose options that seem straightforward or make common mistakes.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors, especially if they misunderstand the order of operations or the inclusion of all numbers.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of mean and can perform calculations accurately. They are less likely to make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also analyze and critique given options for accuracy.

## 7: Predictions
- **Below Basic**: Might choose B due to confusion over order of operations (20%), C because of not understanding the count (30%), A because it's close but doesn't include 0 (20%), and D if they realize their mistake (30%).
- **Basic**: More likely to choose A (40%) because it's closest to correct, B (20%) due to misinterpretation, C (20%) because of counting error, and D (20%).
- **Proficient**: Will likely choose A (60%) because they see it's almost correct, B (10%) for occasional mistake, C (5%) for clear error, and D (25%) if they notice A’s flaw.
- **Advanced**: Will predominantly choose A (70%) for its correctness once assuming the 0 is included in the implied calculation, B (5%) for critique, C (0%) for clear error, and D (25%).

Given these considerations, here is a predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=70% B=5% C=0% D=25%
