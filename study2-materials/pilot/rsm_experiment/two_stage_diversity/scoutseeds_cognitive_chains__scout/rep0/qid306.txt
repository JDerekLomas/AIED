## Step 1: Analyze the problem and the perspectives given
The question requires predicting the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for the given problems. The problems are:
- Problem P: \( 4-5+6= \)
- Problem Q: \( 4+5 \times 6= \)

## 2: Understand the correct order of operations
For Problem P, since it only involves addition and subtraction, the operations are performed from left to right. Therefore, the first calculation should be \( 4-5 \).
For Problem Q, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), the first calculation should be \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 3: Evaluate each option
- Option A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - Incorrect for Problem Q because it doesn't follow the order of operations.
- Option B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Correct for both problems.
- Option C: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - Incorrect for both problems.
- Option D: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Incorrect for Problem P.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the order of operations. They might choose options based on simple addition or subtraction without considering the correct order of operations. Expect a higher percentage of incorrect choices, possibly scattered across A, C, and D.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make mistakes. They are more likely to recognize the need for \( 4-5 \) in Problem P but might be unsure about Problem Q, potentially leading to a notable percentage choosing A or D.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand the order of operations. They should predominantly choose B, with a small percentage possibly misinterpreting Problem P or Q.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, including the order of operations. They are expected to almost unanimously choose B.

## 5: Estimate percentages
Given the understanding of the problems and the likely student responses:
- **Below_basic**: A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20% (scattered due to lack of understanding)
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=60%, C=10%, D=10% (mostly correct but with some errors)
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2% (mostly correct with minor errors)
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=98%, C=1%, D=1% (nearly all correct)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
