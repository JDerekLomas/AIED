## Step 1: Analyzing the Question and Solution Process
The question requires students to evaluate two expressions, $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$, and then determine which symbol ($\>$, $\<$, $=$, or $\geq$) belongs in the box between them. The correct solution involves following the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), which leads to $8+12 \div 4 = 11$ and $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$. Since $11 > 5$, the correct symbol is $\>$.

## 2: Understanding Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students who struggle with basic mathematical concepts and may not fully understand or apply the order of operations correctly.
- **Basic**: Students who have a grasp of basic concepts but may make occasional mistakes or have difficulty applying concepts to different situations.
- **Proficient**: Students who consistently apply mathematical concepts correctly and can solve problems with accuracy.
- **Advanced**: Students who not only solve problems accurately but may also show a deeper understanding, reason more abstractly, and solve complex problems efficiently.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the solution process:
- **Below Basic**: These students may struggle with the order of operations or make careless mistakes. They might incorrectly calculate one or both expressions or misunderstand the comparison, potentially leading to a higher percentage choosing incorrect options like B) $\<$ or C) $=$.
- **Basic**: Students at this level are likely to understand the order of operations but might still make some errors in calculation or comparison. However, they are more likely to choose A) $\>$ as they grasp the fundamental concepts.
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately calculate both expressions and compare them correctly, leading to a high percentage choosing A) $\>$.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level will easily solve the problem and understand that $\>$ is the correct symbol. They may also recognize that $\geq$ is not correct because the expressions are not equal.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Based on the understanding of each ability level:
- **Below Basic**: A=60% (some get it right by chance or partial understanding), B=20% (misunderstand or miscalculate), C=10% (think they're equal), D=10% (overcautious or misunderstand).
- **Basic**: A=80% (most understand and apply correctly), B=10% (some mistakes), C=5% (rarely think they're equal), D=5% (unlikely but possible).
- **Proficient**: A=95% (almost all get it right), B=3% (minor mistakes), C=1% (very few think they're equal), D=1% (rarely consider $\geq$).
- **Advanced**: A=99% (nearly all solve correctly), B=1% (unlikely mistakes), C=0% (none think they're equal), D=0% (none consider $\geq$).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
