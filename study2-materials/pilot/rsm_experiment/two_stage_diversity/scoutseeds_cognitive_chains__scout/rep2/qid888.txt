## Step 1: Analyze the question and the options provided
The question asks students to multiply out the brackets for the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct answer can be found using the FOIL method: First, Outer, Inner, Last. This yields \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\), which corresponds to option B.

## 2: Consider the common misconceptions and errors
Common misconceptions might include incorrect applications of the FOIL method, errors in combining like terms, or mistakes in handling negative signs. For example, a mistake in combining the \(m\) terms or in handling the signs could lead to incorrect answers.

## 3: Predict the performance of students at different ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the FOIL method, incorrectly combine terms, or make errors with negative signs. They might choose A, C, or D due to these mistakes.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make simple errors. They are likely to choose B but with a smaller margin of confidence compared to higher ability levels.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the FOIL method and can apply it correctly. They are likely to choose B with a high degree of accuracy.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only apply the method correctly but also understand the underlying algebraic principles. They are highly likely to choose B and might also be able to generate the expression from memory.

## 4: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (simple mistake, e.g., not combining terms correctly), B=40% (some understanding but errors), C=15% (mistake with signs or terms), D=15% (error in calculation or sign handling).
- **Basic:** A=15%, B=70%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=95%, C=3%, D=2%.

## 5: Adjust the estimates based on the question's specifics and common student errors
Adjusting for realistic student performance and common errors in algebraic manipulations:
- **Below Basic:** A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
- **Basic:** A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
- **Proficient:** A=2% B=90% C=3% D=5%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=90% C=3% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
