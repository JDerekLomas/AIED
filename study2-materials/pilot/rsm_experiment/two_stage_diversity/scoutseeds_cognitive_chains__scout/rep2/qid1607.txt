Based on the analysis provided across the different perspectives, and considering typical student performance at various ability levels, I would predict the following percentages for each option:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%

These predictions reflect the understanding that:
- Students who are below basic might not fully comprehend the steps or the equation, leading to a spread across incorrect options.
- Students at the basic level have a foundational understanding but may struggle with verification or making conclusions, hence a higher inclination towards A but with a notable percentage for D.
- Proficient students understand the process and can identify the correct step but might occasionally misinterpret or make minor calculation errors.
- Advanced students are likely to consistently identify the correct step and conclude accurately, with a very high percentage choosing A.
