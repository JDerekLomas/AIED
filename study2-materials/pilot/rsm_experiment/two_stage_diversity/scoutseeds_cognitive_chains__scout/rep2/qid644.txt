## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Perspectives
The question involves multiplying two terms indicated by arrows in the expression \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), specifically \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation yields \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\), which corresponds to option A: \(+4\).

## 2: Analyzing Student Perspectives
All provided perspectives (1 through 5) demonstrate a correct understanding of multiplying two negative numbers, which results in a positive number. Each perspective correctly calculates \(-1 \times -4 = 4\) and chooses option A: \(+4\) as the answer.

## 3: Considering Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations or rules for negative numbers. However, given that all perspectives provided demonstrate an understanding of the rule for multiplying negative numbers, it's likely that a significant portion would still arrive at the correct answer by chance or with guidance. But, there might be confusion with the signs, potentially leading to B: \(-4\).

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic arithmetic and rules for integers. They would likely understand that two negatives make a positive and calculate the product correctly, choosing A: \(+4\).

- **Proficient**: These students are expected to accurately apply rules and calculate products of negative numbers correctly, almost certainly choosing A: \(+4\).

- **Advanced**: Advanced students would not only calculate the product correctly but might also do so efficiently and accurately, likely always choosing A: \(+4\).

## 4: Predicting Answer Choices by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Given potential confusion, let's assume 20% might choose B: \(-4\) due to misunderstanding the rule, and the rest mostly choose A correctly, with a few scatterings to C and D. So, A=70%, B=20%, C=5%, D=5%.

- **Basic**: Students here are more likely to get it right, so A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.

- **Proficient**: With a solid understanding, A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

- **Advanced**: Almost all will choose correctly, A=99%, B=1%, C=0%, D=0%.

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
- **basic**: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- **proficient**: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
- **advanced**: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
