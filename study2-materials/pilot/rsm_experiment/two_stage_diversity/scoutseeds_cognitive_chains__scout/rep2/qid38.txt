## Step 1: Understand the question and the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for the given math question.

## 2: Analyze the correct solution
The correct solution to the problem \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\) involves finding a common denominator, which is \(2x\). This leads to \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}\), which corresponds to option A.

## 3: Consider student perspectives and potential mistakes
- Students who are below_basic might struggle with finding a common denominator or adding the fractions, potentially leading them to choose incorrect options.
- Basic students might understand the need for a common denominator but could make calculation errors.
- Proficient students are likely to solve the problem correctly, choosing option A.
- Advanced students are also expected to choose option A but might also be able to simplify or manipulate the equation in more complex ways.

## 4: Estimate percentages for each ability level
### below_basic
Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of adding fractions with different denominators. They could choose any option randomly or based on a misunderstanding. Given the nature of the question, a significant portion might choose A due to guessing or partial understanding, but errors in calculation or concept could lead to a distribution like A=40% (guessing the correct form), B=20% (incorrect calculation), C=20% (completely off), D=20% (another incorrect calculation).

### basic
Basic students have a foundational understanding and are likely to attempt the problem. They might make simple mistakes. A high percentage might still choose A (correct answer) due to understanding the basic process, but some might choose D due to incorrect addition (3+4=7). Estimate: A=70%, B=10%, C=10%, D=10%.

### proficient
Proficient students understand the process well and are likely to choose A. They might have an occasional mistake but are generally accurate. Estimate: A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.

### advanced
Advanced students are very confident and accurate. They are expected to choose A almost universally, with very few mistakes. Estimate: A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

## 5: Convert estimates into the required format
Given the estimates:
- below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- basic: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
- proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
