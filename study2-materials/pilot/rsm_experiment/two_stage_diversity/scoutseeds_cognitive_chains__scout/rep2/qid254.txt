Below Basic:
The below-basic students might struggle with understanding the concept of mean and evaluating the options. 

They might see option A as a simple addition and division, which they could potentially solve: A=40% 
B seems a bit confusing because of its notation but could trick them into misunderstanding order of operations: B=20% 
C could look right due to missing steps of checking divisors: C=20% 
They might not evaluate or critically analyze much and default to D as an alternative to others not fully understood: D=20%

So, below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%

Basic:
Basic-level students would likely start by calculating the mean themselves and checking against options.

Since A evaluates to the right calculation after addition omitted at start: A=60%
Understanding on B limited possibly not getting notation meaning divide then add :B=15%
 C gets rejected primarily: C=10%
 Upon issues noticed on the evaluation on primarily options could then default. 

Therefore to Basic students option not obvious evaluated discredits all A provides right method;  
so basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%

Proficient:
The more rigorous the understanding then.

Direct addition check validate A holds: A=75%
 Confusion with B from the initial add Division interchanged. So; B=5%
 Error clearly apparent evaluating  from four   C quickly discounted proficient .; not default on to incorrect on .hence; C= 5% 
 Hence for majority right, evaluation disallowing B.C to validate dis credit 
 hence to the best proficiency 

It appears;   proficient: A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
Advanced:
The advanced level students likely understand deeply

Thus A = obviously right through re evaluations 
They may still evaluate B 
  But likely they pick A; 
Thus on advanced student understanding

so.advanced A appears : obvious best; thus
 hence on A still obvious best with much deeper method evaluation B  somewhat noticed 

; advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
