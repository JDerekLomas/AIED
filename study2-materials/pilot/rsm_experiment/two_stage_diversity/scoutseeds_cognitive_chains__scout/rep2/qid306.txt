To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the thought processes and likely errors or correct understandings based on common mathematical knowledge and the application of the order of operations.

## Step 1: Understanding the Order of Operations
The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS: Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. For Problem P, \( 4-5+6 \), there are no brackets, indices, division, or multiplication, so operations are performed from left to right. For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6 \), multiplication should be done before addition.

## 2: Analyzing Problem P
For Problem P, students should start with \( 4-5 \) if following the left-to-right approach for addition and subtraction. This suggests that options A and B, which both start with \( 4-5 \) for Problem P, are more likely to be chosen by students who understand or think they understand the basic rules.

## 3: Analyzing Problem Q
For Problem Q, the correct operation to do first according to the order of operations is \( 5 \times 6 \). This matches with options B and D.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations. They might choose operations randomly or based on incorrect assumptions. Option A seems plausible because students might incorrectly apply operations or not understand that multiplication takes precedence over addition. **A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%**
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic grasp but might still make mistakes. They are likely to choose B as it correctly identifies the first operation for Problem P and also gets Problem Q right with \( 5 \times 6 \). **A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%**
- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations well. They are likely to choose B as it's the correct option. **A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%**
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can also apply the rules accurately and quickly. The vast majority would choose B. **A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
