To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the perspectives provided and the common mistakes or correct understanding that students might have.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires identifying the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \), which is \( \frac{c}{h+4} \).

## 2: Analyzing Student Perspectives
- **Perspective 1, 2, 3, 4, 5**: All these perspectives correctly identify that \( c \div(h+4) \) translates to \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which corresponds to option A. These students understand the basic algebraic convention for division.

## 3: Identifying Common Mistakes
- **Option B** (\( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)) seems to confuse the operation by adding 4 to \( c \), which might appeal to students who misunderstand how to handle the division with an expression in the denominator.
- **Option C** (\( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)) could attract students who misinterpret the division and addition operations.
- **Option D** (\( \frac{h+4}{c} \)) might appeal to students who incorrectly reverse the numerator and denominator.

## 4: Predicting Student Choices by Ability Level
### Below Basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic conventions and could be more prone to choosing incorrect options due to lack of understanding.
- A: 40% (some understanding but might be insecure)
- B: 25% (misunderstanding of algebraic expressions)
- C: 20% (misapplication of operations)
- D: 15% (reversal of numerator and denominator)

### Basic
Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make errors.
- A: 60% (recognize basic algebraic division)
- B: 20% (simple mistakes in expression)
- C: 10% (confusion with operations)
- D: 10% (basic misunderstanding)

### Proficient
Proficient students understand algebraic conventions well but might occasionally make careless mistakes.
- A: 85% (strong understanding of algebraic division)
- B: 8% (occasional mistake)
- C: 4% (rare but possible confusion)
- D: 3% (unlikely but could happen with very careless mistake)

### Advanced
Advanced students have a deep understanding and are less likely to make errors.
- A: 95% (excellent understanding of algebraic conventions)
- B: 3% (uncommon mistake)
- C: 1% (rare mistake)
- D: 1% (very rare mistake)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=8% C=4% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
