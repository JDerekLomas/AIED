## Step 1: Analyzing the question and the given equation
The equation given is $10x - 6y = 30$, and we need to find $x$ when $y = 0.5$. This requires substituting $y = 0.5$ into the equation and solving for $x$.

## 2: Solving for $x$
Substituting $y = 0.5$ into the equation gives $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$. Simplifying this yields $10x - 3 = 30$. Adding 3 to both sides gives $10x = 33$. Dividing both sides by 10 gives $x = 3.3$.

## 3: Understanding student ability levels
- Below_basic: Students who struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and may not fully understand how to substitute values into an equation or solve for a variable.
- Basic: Students who can perform basic algebraic manipulations but may make occasional mistakes or have difficulty with more complex problems.
- Proficient: Students who can consistently solve algebraic problems correctly, including substitution and solving for variables.
- Advanced: Students who can solve complex algebraic problems efficiently and may be able to apply algebraic concepts to real-world situations.

## 4: Predicting student responses
- **Below_basic**: These students might struggle with the substitution step or making errors in calculation. They might choose an incorrect answer due to miscalculation or not understanding the equation. Likely, they would choose an answer that doesn't match their calculation or guess randomly.
- **Basic**: Students at this level might get the calculation right but could be distracted by incorrect options or make simple arithmetic mistakes. They have a higher chance of getting it right but might still choose incorrectly.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to solve the equation correctly and choose the right answer, C) $3.3$.
- **Advanced**: These students would also solve the equation correctly and choose C) $3.3$, with confidence.

## 5: Estimating percentages
Given the nature of the question and the solutions:
- **Below_basic**: A=20% (random guess), B=20% (random guess), C=40% (partial understanding), D=20% (random guess). However, considering the calculations provided in various perspectives, it seems reasonable that a significant portion might still stumble upon C, so let's adjust to A=15%, B=15%, C=60%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=10%, C=75%, D=5%. They are more likely to get it right but might make some mistakes.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%. They are likely to get it right.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%. They are highly likely to get it right.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
