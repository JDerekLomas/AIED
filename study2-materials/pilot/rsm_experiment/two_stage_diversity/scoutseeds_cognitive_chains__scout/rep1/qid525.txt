To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the options and the common mistakes or misunderstandings students might have.

- **Option A: \( \frac{99}{20} \)** is the improper fraction result of the addition, not a mixed number as the question requests.
- **Option B: \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \)** is the correct mixed number result of the addition.
- **Option C: \( \frac{99}{40} \)** might result from a miscalculation of the common denominator or incorrect addition.
- **Option D: \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \)** seems to result from a significant miscalculation, possibly not converting to a common denominator correctly or making an error in simplification.

## Step 1: Analyzing Student Performance
Students below the basic level might not understand how to convert mixed numbers to improper fractions, find common denominators, add fractions, or convert back to mixed numbers. They are likely to choose incorrectly.

## 2: Predictions for Each Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** These students might choose any option randomly due to a lack of understanding of the concepts. However, they might lean towards options that seem "complete" or look like a final answer without much calculation, such as A or D. B=20% (some might get it through luck or guessing), A=30%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level understand the basic concepts but might make calculation errors. They are more likely to choose B but could also choose A if they forgot to convert to a mixed number. B=60%, A=25%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** These students have a good grasp of the concepts and are likely to choose B. Errors might lead to A or C. B=85%, A=10%, C=4%, D=1%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students understand the concepts well and are less likely to make errors. They should almost always choose B. B=98%, A=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=60% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=85% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%
