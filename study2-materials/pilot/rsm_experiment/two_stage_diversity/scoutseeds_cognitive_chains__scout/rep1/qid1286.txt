To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the common misconceptions and correct understanding of the formula for the volume of a sphere and its rearrangement.

## Step 1: Understanding the Volume Formula and Its Rearrangement
The correct formula for the volume of a sphere is \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\). To find \(r\), one must rearrange this formula: \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\). This corresponds to option C.

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
- Option A: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \) suggests a misunderstanding where the student might have incorrectly rearranged the formula, possibly confusing the multiplication and division steps.
- Option B: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \) implies another common mistake where the student forgets to account for \(\pi\) in the denominator.
- Option D: \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \) indicates a significant misunderstanding, possibly from incorrectly applying algebraic manipulations or forgetting to cube root the entire fraction.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the formula or how to rearrange it. They are likely to guess or choose an option that seems plausible but is incorrect. Option A and B might attract some of these students due to their seemingly correct structure but actually representing incorrect manipulations.
- **Basic:** Students with basic understanding might recognize the correct formula but struggle with rearranging it. They might be tempted by options that look similar to the correct formula but are incorrect, such as A and B.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the formula and can rearrange it. However, under pressure, they might make careless mistakes, leading to choosing incorrect options like A or B.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to have a strong grasp of the formula and its rearrangement, making them more likely to choose the correct option, C.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
- **Basic:** A=20% B=20% C=50% D=10%
- **Proficient:** A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
- **Advanced:** A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%

The best answer is C.
