To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the problem and the common mistakes students might make.

## Step 1: Understanding the Problem
The problem requires students to evaluate two statements about solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\). Tom suggests \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), and Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\).

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom's statement can be verified by adding 5 to both sides of the equation, which is a fundamental and correct algebraic step. Thus, Tom is correct.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie's statement can be evaluated by multiplying the entire equation by 3, yielding \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\). So, Katie is incorrect.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not fully understand how to isolate \(x\) or might make simple arithmetic errors. Given the simplicity of Tom's correct step and the obvious manipulation error in Katie's step, these students might be more likely to choose the wrong answer due to lack of understanding.
  - A: 60% (recognize Tom's correctness but not Katie's error)
  - B: 20% (think Katie is right)
  - C: 10% (think both are right)
  - D: 10% (think neither is right)

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a grasp of basic algebra but might still make careless mistakes.
  - A: 80% (understand Tom's step, see Katie's error)
  - B: 10% (misunderstand the equation)
  - C: 5% (confused about algebraic steps)
  - D: 5% (do not understand either step)

- **Proficient**: Students here are comfortable with algebra and can solve equations with ease.
  - A: 90% (clearly see Tom's correctness and Katie's mistake)
  - B: 5% (unlikely to choose Katie)
  - C: 3% (rarely confused)
  - D: 2% (understand both are incorrect, but this is rare)

- **Advanced**: These students not only solve equations but also can critically evaluate the process.
  - A: 95% (immediately recognize Tom's correct step and the error in Katie's)
  - B: 2% (advanced students are less likely to make basic mistakes)
  - C: 2% (unlikely, as they understand both positions)
  - D: 1% (highly unlikely, as they clearly see Tom's correctness)

The final prediction, given the detailed analysis and understanding that these are general predictions based on typical student performance, would likely look like this:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
