To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the provided perspectives.

The question requires the application of the order of operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS) to two simple mathematical expressions. 

## Step 1: Understanding the Order of Operations
BODMAS/BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices (or Orders), Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. This rule dictates the order in which operations should be performed in a mathematical expression.

## 2: Analyzing Problem P
For Problem P, \( 4-5+6 \), there are only addition and subtraction operations. According to BODMAS, when there are only addition and subtraction operations, we perform them from left to right. Therefore, the first calculation to do is \( 4-5 \).

## 3: Analyzing Problem Q
For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6 \), there is a multiplication and an addition. Following BODMAS, multiplication should be done before addition. Therefore, the first calculation to do is \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 4: Evaluating the Options
- Option A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - Incorrect for Problem Q because it doesn't follow BODMAS.
- Option B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Correct for both problems.
- Option C: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - Incorrect for both.
- Option D: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Incorrect for Problem P.

## 5: Predicting Student Choices by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle with the concepts or not understand BODMAS well. They might choose options based on misunderstanding or guessing.
- **Basic**: Students have a basic understanding but might still make errors in applying BODMAS, especially in more complex expressions or if they've not fully grasped the concept.
- **Proficient**: Students understand BODMAS and can apply it correctly to simple expressions like these.
- **Advanced**: Students not only understand BODMAS but can also apply it in more complex scenarios and might have a deeper understanding of mathematical operations.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question and assuming typical student understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (random guess), B=20% (some understanding but applied wrong), C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=70% (most understand to do \( 4-5 \) and \( 5 \times 6 \) first), C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=90% (most apply BODMAS correctly), C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95% (nearly all apply BODMAS correctly), C=2%, D=3%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=92% C=3% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
