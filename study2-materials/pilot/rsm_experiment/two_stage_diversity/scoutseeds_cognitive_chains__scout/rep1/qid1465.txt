## Step 1: Analyzing the Question and Perspectives
The question requires evaluating the expression \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). All the provided perspectives correctly follow the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and arrive at the answer \(6\), which corresponds to option A.

## 2: Understanding Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students who struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of the order of operations.
- **Basic**: Students who have a basic understanding of arithmetic operations but may make occasional errors, especially with more complex expressions.
- **Proficient**: Students who consistently apply the order of operations and perform calculations accurately.
- **Advanced**: Students who not only perform calculations accurately but also understand the underlying concepts well and can apply them to more complex problems.

## 3: Predicting Student Choices
- **Below Basic**: These students might not fully understand the order of operations or might make calculation errors. They could choose any option due to misunderstandings or careless mistakes. However, given the simplicity of the question, a significant portion might still stumble upon the correct answer or common misconceptions.

- **Basic**: Students at this level are likely to understand the basic operations and possibly the order of operations. They might make minor calculation errors but are more likely to choose A) \(6\).

- **Proficient**: These students are expected to accurately follow the order of operations and calculate the correct answer, which is A) \(6\).

- **Advanced**: Similar to proficient students, advanced students will easily solve the expression and choose A) \(6\), but they might also be more inclined to check their work.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given that all perspectives lead to the correct answer (A) \(6\), and assuming most students are familiar with the order of operations:
- **Below Basic**: A=60% (some get it right by chance or basic understanding), B=20% (could misinterpret operations), C=10% (miscalculation), D=10% (miscalculation).
- **Basic**: A=80% (understand operations but may make small errors), B=10% (simple miscalculation), C=5% (less likely), D=5% (less likely).
- **Proficient**: A=95% (strong understanding and application), B=3% (unlikely but possible minor error), C=1% (very unlikely), D=1% (very unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=99% (highly accurate and confident), B=0.5% (extremely rare error), C=0.25% (unlikely), D=0.25% (unlikely).

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
- below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
- advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%
