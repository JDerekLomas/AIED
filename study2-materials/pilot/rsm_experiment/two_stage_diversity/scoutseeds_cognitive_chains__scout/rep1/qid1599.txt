To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the provided perspectives.

The correct answer is A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \). The question requires understanding of algebraic conventions for division.

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic notation and understanding of division in algebra. They might choose options that seem to represent operations in a more straightforward or incorrect manner.
  - A: 40% (some understanding but might be insecure)
  - B: 25% (incorrect but involves relevant elements)
  - C: 20% (misinterprets division and addition)
  - D: 15% (completely misinterprets the order and operation)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and are more likely to recognize the correct notation but might still be insecure.
  - A: 60% (recognize the correct notation)
  - B: 20% (might confuse with adding 4 to c)
  - C: 10% (misunderstands distribution or addition)
  - D: 10% (misunderstands inverse operation)

- **Proficient**: These students have a good grasp of algebraic conventions and are likely to choose the correct option confidently.
  - A: 85% (confidently select the correct notation)
  - B: 8% (unlikely but possible minor mistake)
  - C: 4% (understand division but possibly confused with distribution)
  - D: 3% (recognize the inverse operation as incorrect)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident in their algebraic understanding.
  - A: 95% (very confident in their algebraic notation)
  - B: 3% (very unlikely, possibly a careless mistake)
  - C: 1% (unlikely, as distribution and operations are clear)
  - D: 1% (unlikely to misunderstand the operation order)

Given the analysis, here are the predictions:

below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=8% C=4% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
