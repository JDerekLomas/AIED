To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the options and the common mistakes or understanding associated with each.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the correct calculation of the mean of the numbers 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. The mean is calculated by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the count of numbers.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). This option seems to calculate the mean correctly because \(1+3+4+7 = 15\) and \(15 / 5 = 3\), which is the correct mean. However, it implicitly excludes 0 from the sum.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \), suggests adding all the numbers first and then dividing 7 by 5, which is incorrect due to the order of operations. This would lead to an incorrect calculation.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \), incorrectly divides by 4 instead of 5 and also excludes 0 from the sum.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D, "None of them," would be correct if none of the provided calculations yield the correct mean.

## 6: Considering Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of mean or might make basic calculation errors. They could be tempted by options that look simpler or seem to follow a straightforward approach, even if incorrect.
- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding but might struggle with applying formulas correctly or understanding the implications of order of operations.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept of mean and can apply it but might be swayed by options that closely resemble the correct formula.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, including the mean, and are less likely to be misled by incorrect options.

## 7: Predicting Student Choices
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** Might choose B (20%) for its simplicity, C (30%) for lacking understanding of division, A (30%) for resembling a known formula, and D (20%) for uncertainty.
- **Basic:** May choose A (60%) for its resemblance to the mean formula, B (20%) for misinterpreting order of operations, C (10%) for mistake, and D (10%) for doubt.
- **Proficient:** Likely to choose A (80%) for understanding it yields the correct result despite the omission of 0, B (5%) for mistake, C (5%) for error, and D (10%) for critical thinking.
- **Advanced:** Almost certainly choose A (90%) for recognizing its correctness, with a small percentage considering D (10%) for ensuring no better option exists.

## 8: Assigning Percentages
Based on understanding and likely errors:
- below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
- advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
