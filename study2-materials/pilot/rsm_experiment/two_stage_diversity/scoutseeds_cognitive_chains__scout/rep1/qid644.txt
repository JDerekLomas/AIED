## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Perspectives
The question asks students to multiply the terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct mathematical operation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\), which corresponds to option A) \(+4\).

## 2: Analyzing Student Perspectives
All perspectives provided demonstrate an understanding that multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number. However, the confidence and accuracy in applying this rule vary. Most perspectives conclude that \(-1 \times -4 = 4\), aligning with option A) \(+4\).

## 3: Assessing Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic mathematical operations or have significant gaps in understanding. They might not apply the rule correctly or could be confused about the signs.
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic operations but may make careless mistakes. They are likely to know that two negatives make a positive but might not apply it accurately under pressure.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of mathematical concepts, including the rule for multiplying negative numbers. They are likely to answer correctly.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the concept but can also apply it in more complex situations. They would definitely choose the correct option.

## 4: Predicting Student Choices
Given the information:
- **Below Basic**: Might have a higher chance of choosing incorrectly due to lack of understanding or careless mistakes. Let's assume 20% choose B) \(-4\) (due to not applying the rule), 10% choose C) \(+5\) or D) \(-5\) (completely off), and 60% choose A) \(+4\) (some understanding but shaky).
- **Basic**: Would likely have a good grasp of the concept but might make some mistakes. Assume 80% choose A) \(+4\), 10% choose B) \(-4\), and 5% each choose C or D.
- **Proficient**: Would confidently choose A) \(+4\). Assume 95% choose A, and 5% are split among B, C, or D due to minor errors.
- **Advanced**: Would almost certainly choose A) \(+4\). Assume 99% choose A, and 1% is split among other options due to very minor oversights.

## 5: Final Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%
- **Basic**: A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%
- **Advanced**: A=99%, B=0.5%, C=0.25%, D=0.25%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%
