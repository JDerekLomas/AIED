To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the perspectives provided.

The question requires students to evaluate two expressions following the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and then compare the results to determine the correct symbol to use.

## Step 1: Evaluating the Expressions
The expressions given are \(8 + 12 \div 4\) and \((8 + 12) \div 4\). 

## 2: Applying BIDMAS/BODMAS
For \(8 + 12 \div 4\), division comes first: \(12 \div 4 = 3\), then \(8 + 3 = 11\).

For \((8 + 12) \div 4\), operations in brackets come first: \(8 + 12 = 20\), then \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 3: Comparing Results
Comparing the results: \(11 > 5\), so the correct symbol is \(>\).

## 4: Analyzing Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with following the order of operations or comparing numbers. They might incorrectly evaluate the expressions or choose a symbol based on incorrect calculations. Expect a higher percentage of incorrect answers, potentially spread across B, C, and D, but with a significant portion still incorrectly choosing A due to partial understanding.

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to correctly apply BIDMAS/BODMAS but could still be unsure about the comparison, potentially leading to a higher rate of choosing A, with some errors in B and C.

- **Proficient:** These students are expected to correctly apply BIDMAS/BODMAS and compare the results accurately. A high percentage are expected to choose A) \(>\).

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only apply the rules correctly but also understand the implications of their calculations. They are likely to choose A) \(>\) with a very high confidence level, and a minimal chance of selecting other options.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the clear nature of the question and the correct application of BIDMAS/BODMAS leading to a straightforward comparison, we estimate:

- **Below Basic:** A=60% (partial understanding, might get it right by chance or calculation), B=20% (misunderstanding), C=10% (thinking they're equal), D=10% (overcautious or misunderstanding).

- **Basic:** A=80% (most get it right with some effort), B=10% (some mistakes), C=5% (occasional error), D=5% (rarely chosen).

- **Proficient:** A=95% (accurately apply rules), B=3% (minor errors), C=1% (rare mistake), D=1% (unlikely).

- **Advanced:** A=99% (almost certain), B=1% (extremely rare error), C=0% (virtually none), D=0% (virtually none).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
