As a teacher who has marked thousands of these papers, I recognise this question as one of the most effective "diagnostic" items for testing structural understanding of algebra versus mere arithmetic "number-crunching." 

The "Big $\div$ Small" shortcut mentioned in several perspectives is particularly lethal here. Students at lower levels aren't solving an equation; they are looking at a 10 and a 5 and trying to make a "maths fact" happen. At the higher levels, the hurdle is resisting the urge to take a mental shortcut that leads to the "clean" integer 2.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=50% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
advanced: A=85% B=5% C=10% D=0%
