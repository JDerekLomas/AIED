As a Year 9 maths teacher, I have evaluated these perspectives against common performance data for this topic. 

The "Below Basic" group will likely default to the most intuitive "add across" heuristic (Perspective 5). The "Basic" group often recognises that denominators must be the same but forgets to maintain equivalence in the numerator (Perspective 1 and 2). The "Proficient" group is likely to attempt the correct method but may occasionally get tripped up by the "cross-multiplication simplification bottleneck" (Perspective 4). The "Advanced" group should easily identify the common denominator of $2x$ and perform the correct scaling.

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=5% D=40%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
