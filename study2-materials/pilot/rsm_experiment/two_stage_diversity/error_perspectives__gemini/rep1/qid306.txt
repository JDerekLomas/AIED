As a teacher who has marked thousands of these papers, I can tell you that the "BODMAS trap" is one of the most persistent hurdles for Year 9s. Even bright students can be "over-educated" into making this mistake by adhering too strictly to the mnemonic letters rather than the underlying priority rules.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on their ability levels:

**below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%**
Students at this level often default to a strictly linear "left-to-right" reading for everything (leading them to Option A) or they have a vague, scrambled memory of the acronym and guess based on "plus" signs looking easier (Option C).

**basic: A=20% B=20% C=25% D=35%**
These students have learned the BIDMAS/BODMAS acronym but apply it as a rigid law. Because they understand Q must start with multiplication, they will lean heavily toward Option D, falling squarely into the "Addition-before-Subtraction" trap identified in the perspectives.

**proficient: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%**
This is the most divided group. Many understand that multiplication takes priority in Q, but about half will still be seduced by the literal order of "A before S" in Problem P. They are the prime demographic for the "Option D" error.

**advanced: A=5% B=85% C=0% D=10%**
The vast majority of top-tier students understand the "Left-to-Right" convention for equal-priority operators (+ and -). The small percentage choosing D likely reflects a momentary "autopilot" error or a lingering cognitive bias toward the acronym structure.

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=25% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
advanced: A=05% B=85% C=00% D=10%
