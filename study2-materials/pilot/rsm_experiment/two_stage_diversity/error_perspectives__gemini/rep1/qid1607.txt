As a teacher who has marked thousands of these papers, I can tell you that this is a classic "sign-error trap" that targets a specific stage of algebraic development. The "visual cueing" of the plus sign in Step 2 is an incredibly strong distractor for students who have learned "rules" without understanding "balance."

Here is the predicted distribution based on those five perspectives:

**below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%**
At this level, many students struggle with the initial fraction in Step 1, often guessing D. However, the largest group will choose C because the arithmetic of $15 \times 4 = 60$ and $60 + 1 = 61$ is simple and "looks" correct to the naked eye without applying algebraic logic.

**basic: A=35% B=5% C=55% D=5%**
These students often navigate Step 1 successfully but fall directly into the "Perspective 2 & 3" traps. They feel confident because they know "inverse operations" involve doing *something* with the numbers, but they succumb to the visual proximity of the plus sign. C is the most common "incorrect" answer here.

**proficient: A=65% B=0% C=30% D=5%**
Proficient students are usually wary of traps. Most will identify that isolating $k$ requires subtracting 1. However, as noted in "Perspective 1," the "directional interference" still catches about a third of them who are working too quickly and see $61$ as the "logical successor" to $60$.

**advanced: A=92% B=0% C=5% D=3%**
Advanced students have moved beyond the "move the number" heuristic to "balance the equation." They will instantly see that $k=59$. The small percentage of errors here would be due to extreme "shallow processing" or rushing during a mock exam.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=05% C=55% D=05%
proficient: A=65% B=00% C=30% D=05%
advanced: A=92% B=00% C=05% D=03%
