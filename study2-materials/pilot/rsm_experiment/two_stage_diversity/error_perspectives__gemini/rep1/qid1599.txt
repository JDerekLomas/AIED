As a Year 9 teacher, I’ve seen these exact misconceptions play out in mock exams time and again. The transition from linear arithmetic to the formal conventions of algebraic fractions is a significant hurdle. 

Based on the perspectives provided and standard UK Year 9 performance data, here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=10% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=45% B=5% C=25% D=25%
proficient: A=75% B=2% C=13% D=10%
advanced: A=96% B=0% C=3% D=1%

**Rationale:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students here often guess based on visual "clutter." Many choose **D** because $h+4$ looks "bigger" and therefore more like a numerator, or **C** because they process the division symbol only for the adjacent letter ($c \div h$) and simply append the $+4$ as they read from left to right.
*   **Basic:** These students have a loose grasp of algebraic fractions but fall for the "spatial mapping" error. They understand the $\div$ symbol turns into a fraction bar but lack the "Dividend = Top" rule, leading to a high volume of **D** responses. They also struggle with the vinculum as a grouping symbol, making **C** a very attractive "literal translation" of the expression.
*   **Proficient:** Most students in this bracket identify that the fraction bar replaces the division symbol correctly. Their primary error is **C**, caused by the cognitive dissonance of the parentheses disappearing, as described in Perspective 3.
*   **Advanced:** Errors are rare and usually limited to "slipping" into a left-to-right reading of the expression under time pressure (Perspective 4), but the majority correctly identify the vinculum's role.
