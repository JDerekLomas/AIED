Based on the detailed pedagogical perspectives provided, it is clear that this question focuses on a common "misconception nexus" in Year 9: the transition between directed number arithmetic and algebraic expansion. 

Lower-ability students (below_basic/basic) are highly susceptible to "additive thinking," where the proximity of digits leads to addition rather than multiplication. As students gain proficiency, the error shifts from the operation itself (choosing multiplication over addition) to the sign management (the "double negative" rule).

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=15% D=50%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=55% B=25% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=92% B=5% C=1% D=2%
