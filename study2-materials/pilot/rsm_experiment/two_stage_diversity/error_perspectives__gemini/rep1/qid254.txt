As a Year 9 maths teacher, I have marked thousands of these papers. This question is a classic trap that tests the transition from rote calculation to statistical reasoning.

The **below_basic** cohort often ignores the fractional structure entirely or follows the order of operations literally (leading to Choice B). The **basic** group is the most susceptible to the "Null Value Trap," where they see four non-zero digits and instinctively divide by 4 (Choice C). The **proficient** students have moved past the cardinality error but often hesitate at Choice A because the zero is not explicitly written in the numerator, though they eventually recognise it as mathematically identical. The **advanced** students see through the "missing 0" instantly.

Based on these perspectives, here is the predicted percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
