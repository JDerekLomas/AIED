Based on the analysis of the "notational traps" and the cognitive interference between multiplicative and additive inverses, here is the predicted performance distribution for Year 9 students:

below_basic: A=55% B=15% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=65% B=25% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=35% B=60% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=5% B=94% C=0% D=1%
