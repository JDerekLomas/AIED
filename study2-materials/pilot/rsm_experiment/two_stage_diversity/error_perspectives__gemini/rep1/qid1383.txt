As a Year 9 Maths teacher, I see this exact mistake every time we cover indices and substitution. Even my higher-tier students can get tripped up if they are overly reliant on their Casio calculators without using the bracket keys. 

The "Basic" and "Proficient" groups are the most interesting here: the "Basic" students often lose the negative because they forget it entirely, while "Proficient" students include the negative but fall victim to the BIDMAS/order of operations trap explained in the perspectives, leading them straight to C.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on common classroom trends:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
proficient: A=50% B=5% C=40% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=0% C=8% D=0%
