As a Year 9 maths teacher, I see this exact problem every year. It’s the classic battle between "reading math like a sentence" and following BIDMAS (Order of Operations). The presence of the same numbers on both sides creates a powerful "symmetry trap."

On the left ($8 + 12 \div 4$), students must divide first to get $8 + 3 = 11$.
On the right ($(8 + 12) \div 4$), the brackets force the addition first to get $20 \div 4 = 5$.
Since $11 > 5$, the correct answer is **A**.

Here is how I predict the marks would be distributed across the different ability levels in a typical Year 9 mock:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%
