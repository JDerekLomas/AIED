As a Year 9 maths teacher, I have evaluated these perspectives. They accurately reflect the "Standard Form Trap"—where students struggle when $y$ is not isolated. 

**Below Basic** students often rely on "number grabbing," where they take the digits present ($4, 2, 10$) and perform an operation like $10 \times 2$. 

**Basic** students often find the next value in the table ($x=1, y=3$) because it feels "easier" or they forget to divide by the coefficient of $y$. 

**Proficient** students usually understand substitution but frequently fall for the "interchangeable intercept" error, solving for the $x$-intercept ($10 \div 4 = 2.5$) instead of the $y$-intercept.

**Advanced** students should navigate the multi-step rearrangement confidently.

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=35% C=30% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=15% C=60% D=20%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=95% D=3%
