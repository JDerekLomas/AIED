Based on the analysis of these perspectives and common pedagogical trends in Year 9 mock exams, here is the predicted percentage distribution for each ability level:

**below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%**
Students at this level are highly susceptible to the "Add-Across" error described in the perspectives. Distractor D provides immediate visual confirmation of their intuitive logic. A and C are often chosen by those who have a vague memory of needing to convert to improper fractions but lack the fluency to finish the operation.

**basic: A=15% B=35% C=10% D=40%**
At the basic level, students often start with the correct intention (converting to a common denominator) but frequently fall back on the "path of least resistance" when the cognitive load of finding the LCM of 10 and 4 becomes too high. Option D remains a very powerful attractor here.

**proficient: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%**
Proficient students generally understand the need for a common denominator (20). Most will successfully navigate the conversion and addition. The small percentage choosing A likely represents students who converted correctly to an improper fraction ($ \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} $) but failed to read the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."

**advanced: A=5% B=92% C=1% D=2%**
Advanced students will find the LCM of 20 with ease. Their errors are typically clerical or down to misreading the specific formatting requirement (Option A). They are very unlikely to fall for the conceptual "Add-Across" trap of Option D.
