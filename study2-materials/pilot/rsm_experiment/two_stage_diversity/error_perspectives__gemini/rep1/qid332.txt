As a Year 9 maths teacher, I have marked thousands of these papers and the "Partial Multiplication" error presented in Katie’s method is one of the most persistent misconceptions in Key Stage 3 algebra. 

Even students who understand the concept of "balancing" often fall into the "Visual Proximity Trap." They see the denominator as a localized obstacle to be "moved" rather than a divisor of the entire side. Consequently, Katie’s working ($x - 5 = 36$) appears intuitively correct to anyone relying on visual patterns over formal properties. Tom’s approach is the standard "order of operations in reverse" method, which is safer, but students often doubt it when presented with a "faster-looking" alternative.

Based on the common errors identified in the five perspectives, here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

**below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%**
Students at this level often guess based on "looks." Option C is highly attractive because both lines of working "look" like standard algebraic moves. Many will gravitate toward Katie’s method (Option B/C) because $12 \times 3 = 36$ is a satisfying calculation that suggests progress.

**basic: A=35% B=10% C=50% D=5%**
These students likely recognize Tom is correct because they have been drilled to "add first." However, they lack the distributive rigor to see why Katie is wrong. They will assume there are multiple ways to solve the problem and succumb to the "Visual Trap," assuming the $-5$ is unaffected by the $3$.

**proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%**
Proficient students generally follow the correct order of operations (BIDMAS in reverse). Most will identify Tom as correct. However, a significant minority will still be lured by "Selective Multiplication" (Katie), incorrectly applying the shortcut to "get rid of the fraction" without multiplying every term.

**advanced: A=92% B=1% C=5% D=2%**
Top-set students will immediately spot that Katie failed to multiply the constant term. If they make an error, it is usually due to rushing and failing to read the lines of working carefully, or a momentary lapse in distributive logic.

**Summary of predicted percentages:**

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=10% C=50% D=05%
proficient: A=65% B=05% C=25% D=05%
advanced: A=92% B=01% C=05% D=02%
