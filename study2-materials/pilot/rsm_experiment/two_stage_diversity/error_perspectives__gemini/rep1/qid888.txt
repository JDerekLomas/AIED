Based on the five perspectives provided, which highlight the specific cognitive conflicts between "addition logic" and "multiplication logic" when dealing with signed integers in algebra, here is the predicted performance breakdown for Year 9 students:

**below_basic: A=25% B=10% C=30% D=35%**
*   *Rationale:* Students at this level often treat the numbers as independent of their signs or guess based on the "look" of the problem. Many will choose **C** because they apply the "two negatives make a positive" rule to everything, or **D** because they see minus signs in the question and assume the answer must be entirely negative. **A** is also attractive here as a result of simple subtraction (7 - 5).

**basic: A=15% B=25% C=30% D=30%**
*   *Rationale:* These students understand the FOIL process but are highly susceptible to the "Negative Sign Interference" mentioned in Perspective 4. They are likely to consistently get one sign wrong. They either successfully find $-12m$ but fail the constant (leading to **D**), or they correctly identify $+35$ but misapply the sign rule to the middle term (leading to **C**).

**proficient: A=5% B=65% C=15% D=15%**
*   *Rationale:* Most proficient students have mastered the distributive property. However, under exam pressure, a significant minority will still fall into the "Mode Switching" trap described in Perspective 2. The most common errors will be the "Same Sign Confusion" (Perspective 1), leading them to split fairly evenly between the sign errors in **C** and **D**.

**advanced: A=1% B=92% C=4% D=3%**
*   *Rationale:* Advanced students have internalized the distinction between additive and multiplicative integer rules. Errors here are rare and usually "slip" errors (clerical) rather than conceptual. **C** remains slightly more likely than **D** as a "speed error" where the brain carries the positive product sign through the whole expression.
