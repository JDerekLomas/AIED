As a Year 9 examiner, I see these patterns every year. The "left-to-right" reading habit is the primary driver for those selecting A, while the "misplaced decimal" error during squaring accounts for the shift toward D in the mid-range. 

The "Below Basic" group often performs a single operation or guesses based on visual similarities (3 and 0.3 making 0.9, then doubling it for C, or seeing 27 and misplacing the point for D). The "Basic" group is heavily susceptible to the "multiply-before-square" trap. "Proficient" students identify BIDMAS but often struggle with the place value of $0.3 \times 0.3$. "Advanced" students have usually mastered both the order of operations and decimal multiplication.

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=20% B=55% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=0% D=5%
