As a teacher marking these papers, it’s clear that the presence of the zero is the primary "distractor" influencing these statistics. This question tests conceptual understanding of data points versus arithmetic values, alongside knowledge of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

Here is the predicted distribution of answers based on the typical performance of Year 9 students:

**below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=35% D=5%**
Students at this level often struggle with the formal notation of the mean. **Option B** is a significant trap for them; they understand the "process" (add them up, divide by the count) but do not realise that without brackets, the division only applies to the 7. They are also highly likely to fall for the "Zero is Nothing" trap, leading them to **Option C**.

**basic: A=25% B=20% C=45% D=10%**
This group has a stronger grasp of notation than those below basic, but they are the most susceptible to the **Option C** trap mentioned in Perspective 1 and 2. They have learned the "Sum/Count" rule but conceptually view the zero as a non-entity that shouldn't "dilute" the average. **Option A** starts to gain traction here but is often viewed with suspicion because the zero is "missing" from the top.

**proficient: A=65% B=5% C=20% D=10%**
Proficient students generally understand that $n=5$. While they might initially look for an expression that explicitly shows $0+1+3+4+7$, they have the mathematical fluency to recognise that **Option A** is numerically identical and statistically sound. The remaining 20% choosing **Option C** are those still harbouring the "zero doesn't count" misconception under exam pressure.

**advanced: A=92% B=2% C=3% D=3%**
Advanced students will see through the distractors quickly. They recognise that **Option A** is the only one that satisfies both the correct sum (15) and the correct divisor (5). The tiny percentage choosing other options usually results from "over-thinking" (choosing D because the zero isn't explicitly in the numerator) or a rare slip in reading the notation of B.
