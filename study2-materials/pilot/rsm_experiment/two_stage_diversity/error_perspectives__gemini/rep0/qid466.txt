Based on the detailed pedagogical perspectives provided, it is clear that the primary distractors are rooted in the confusion between the **reciprocal** and the **additive inverse**, alongside the "sign-processing conflict" regarding the negative product ($-1$).

Students at lower ability levels often default to visual similarity or simple addition rules, while middle-ability students frequently fall into the "Sign-Interference" trap—correctly identifying the reciprocal but incorrectly applying a sign change. Advanced students are more likely to navigate the product rule correctly, though a small percentage may still succumb to a "negative $\times$ negative = positive" reflex, momentarily forgetting the target is $-1$.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses:
