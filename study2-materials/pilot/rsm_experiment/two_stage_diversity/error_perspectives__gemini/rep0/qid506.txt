As an experienced teacher, I recognize this question as a classic "distractor-heavy" problem. The numbers 3 and 12 are specifically chosen to trigger automatic retrieval of the number 4, bypassing the formal process of multiplying the denominators. Students at the lower end of the spectrum often treat the fraction as two separate integers, while middle-ability students frequently apply the inverse operation to the denominator rather than the whole fraction.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on these cognitive traps:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
