As a teacher, I have seen this specific error recur year after year in Year 9 mocks. The transition from arithmetic to algebraic substitution often reveals that many students have a "surface-level" understanding of BIDMAS/BODMAS. 

The primary battleground in this question is Option C. Students at the 'Basic' and 'Proficient' levels often have the arithmetic skill to calculate $3^4=81$, but they lack the structural algebraic understanding that the variable $k$ acts as a "container" for the value $-3$, necessitating the use of parentheses. Furthermore, the reliance on scientific calculators significantly inflates the selection of Option C, as many students will type $-3^4$ exactly as it appears in their head, and the calculator will confirm their incorrect sign.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on their ability levels:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
proficient: A=45% B=05% C=48% D=02%
advanced: A=92% B=00% C=08% D=00%
