As a teacher who has marked countless Year 9 papers, I have seen these exact patterns of error time and again. The "butterfly method" (Perspective 5) is a scourge on algebraic fluency, and the "add the denominators" instinct (Perspective 2) remains the most common misconception for students who haven't yet mastered the concept of a shared base.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on the difficulty levels mentioned:

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=20% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=10% D=20%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=2% D=5%

**Rationalising the choices:**
*   **Below Basic:** Option B is the "magnetic" choice here. These students treat the numerators and denominators as independent integers ($3+4=7$ and $2+1=3$). Option D also attracts those who recognize a common denominator is needed but lack the operational skill to adjust the numerator.
*   **Basic:** These students often identify $2x$ as the target denominator. However, they frequently forget to scale the numerator of the second fraction (Perspective 3), leading them to Option D. Alternatively, they use the butterfly method and get stuck at $\frac{11x}{2x^2}$, eventually guessing Option C or D because they cannot simplify $x/x^2$.
*   **Proficient:** Most can find the common denominator. The main drop-off here is the "over-complication" noted in Perspectives 4 and 5; students get to $\frac{11x}{2x^2}$ and, in the pressure of a mock exam, either fail to cancel $x$ or incorrectly simplify it to $11/x$ (Option C).
*   **Advanced:** These students recognize that $\frac{4}{x}$ is simply $\frac{8}{2x}$. They avoid the "butterfly" trap entirely and solve the expression mentally with high accuracy. The few errors at this level are usually "slips" or misreading the original coefficient.
