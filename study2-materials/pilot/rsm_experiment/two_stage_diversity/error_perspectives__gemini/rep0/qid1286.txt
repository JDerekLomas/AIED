As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen these exact misconceptions play out in many mock exams. Rearranging formulas involving fractions and $\pi$ is a significant leap for Year 9s. Based on the cognitive traps identified in the perspectives—specifically the "reciprocal flip" error and the "visual transposition" of the $4$ and $3$—here is my prediction of the performance data:

**below_basic: A=25% B=35% C=15% D=25%**
*At this level, students often guess based on "visual familiarity." Option B is the most popular because it keeps the 4 on top and 3 on the bottom, just like the original formula, showing a lack of understanding of inverse operations. Option D appeals to those who know a cube root is needed but cannot manipulate the algebraic "block."*

**basic: A=30% B=30% C=25% D=15%**
*Students here are attempting to rearrange but often fail the "multi-step" hurdle. As identified in Perspective 2, many will successfully move the 3 but then "multiply" by $\pi$ in a moment of cognitive overload (Option A). B remains a strong distractor for those who cannot correctly invert the fraction.*

**proficient: A=15% B=15% C=65% D=5%**
*These students generally understand that they need to multiply by 3 and divide by 4. The main trap for this group is the placement of $\pi$. While most will arrive at Option C, some will still fall into the "hybrid constant" trap mentioned in Perspective 1 and accidentally leave $\pi$ in the numerator.*

**advanced: A=5% B=2% C=91% D=2%**
*Top-tier Year 9 students will treat $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ as a single coefficient and multiply by the reciprocal $\frac{3}{4\pi}$ in one fluid movement. Errors here are usually down to "exam slip" rushing rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.*
