Based on the analysis of these common algebraic misconceptions—specifically the "incomplete distribution error" and the "visual proximity trap"—here is the predicted performance for Year 9 students.

**Below Basic:**
These students struggle with inverse operations and often look for visual cues or familiar numbers (like 12 and 3). Many will guess or be lured by the "cleanliness" of Katie's equation.
below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=45% D=10%

**Basic:**
These students generally understand that "adding 5" or "multiplying by 3" are valid operations. However, they frequently fail to apply multiplication to every term in an expression. They see Katie’s "36" as proof of a correct step and are the most likely group to fall into the "Both" trap.
basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%

**Proficient:**
These students are comfortable with Tom’s method (SAMDIB/reversing BIDMAS). While they are better at spotting errors, a significant portion will still see Katie's $x-5=36$ as a standard way to "clear the fraction" because it matches a mistake they likely make in their own homework.
proficient: A=60% B=5% C=30% D=5%

**Advanced:**
These students have a firm grasp of the distributive property and the "Balance Method." They will recognize immediately that Katie failed to multiply the constant term (-5) by 3.
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=5% D=2%
