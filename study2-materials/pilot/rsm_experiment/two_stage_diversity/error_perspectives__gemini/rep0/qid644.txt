Based on the detailed pedagogical perspectives provided, it is clear that this question acts as a "diagnostic" for whether a student can distinguish between additive and multiplicative rules in an algebraic context. 

The primary "trap" for lower-ability students is the **additive default** (Option D), while mid-ability students often correctly identify the need for a positive result but still struggle with **operator-operand interference** (Option C). Advanced students are expected to have consolidated these rules.

Here is the predicted performance distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=25% D=30%
proficient: A=65% B=10% C=15% D=10%
advanced: A=94% B=02% C=02% D=02%
