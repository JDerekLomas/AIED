As a teacher marking these mocks, I've seen these patterns play out time and again. The "Additive Fraction Misconception" highlighted in the perspectives is a dominant force in Year 9, particularly for those who haven't yet solidified their "fraction sense."

**Option D** is the classic "low-hanging fruit" distractor. **Option B** is the correct answer. **Option A** is a correct value but is an improper fraction, meaning those who solve the arithmetic but forget the "leave your answer as a mixed number" instruction will land here. **Option C** usually attracts those who use the "butterfly method" (multiplying denominators to get 40) but then either forget to convert back to a mixed number or make a calculation error.

Based on these pedagogical perspectives and typical UK Year 9 performance data, here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=20% B=65% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=10% B=88% C=1% D=1%
