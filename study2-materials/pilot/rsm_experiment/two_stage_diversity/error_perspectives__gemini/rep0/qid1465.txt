As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen these specific misconceptions play out in Year 9 mocks many times. 

**Below Basic** students often lack a solid grasp of the order of operations entirely and tend to process numbers from left to right like a sentence. They calculate $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, and finally $2 \times 2 = 4$ (Option B). 

**Basic** students usually know "Multiplication first" ($4 \times 2 = 8$) but are the most susceptible to the "A before S" mnemonic trap described in the perspectives. They see $3 - 5 + 8$ and prioritise $5 + 8 = 13$, leading them to $3 - 13 = -10$ (Option D).

**Proficient** students understand the order of operations but occasionally slip up on directed numbers (integers) or the left-to-right rule under exam pressure.

**Advanced** students recognise that addition and subtraction have equal priority and possess the integer fluency to handle $3 - 5 = -2$ and $-2 + 8 = 6$ correctly.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on these pedagogical insights:

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=0% D=5%
