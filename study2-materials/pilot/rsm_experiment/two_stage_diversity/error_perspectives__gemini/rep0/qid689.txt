As a teacher marking these mocks, I've seen these specific misconceptions play out many times. This question is a classic "trap" because it targets structural understanding rather than just procedural fluency.

For **Below Basic** students, the "Large $\div$ Small" heuristic is almost universal; they see a 10 and a 5 and immediately look for a whole number relationship. **Basic** students often attempt an operation but fail to handle the variable in the denominator, frequently multiplying (reaching 50) or succumbing to the "Fact Family" shortcut (reaching 2). **Proficient** students understand the need for inverse operations but can still experience "cognitive interference," where they correctly move the $p$ but then finish with $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$. **Advanced** students usually recognise the reciprocal relationship and aren't afraid of a decimal answer.

Based on these perspectives, here is the predicted percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=65% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=25% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=10% C=33% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=3% C=4% D=1%
