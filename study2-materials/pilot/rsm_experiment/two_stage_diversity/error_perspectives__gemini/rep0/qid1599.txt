Based on the analysis of these common misconceptions—particularly the "left-to-right" transcription error and the "visual weight" of binomials—here is the predicted breakdown of student responses for Year 9.

**below_basic:** A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%
*Reasoning: These students rely heavily on linear transcription, making Option C the dominant choice. Option B is attractive as a "guess" because it mirrors terms on top and bottom, and D is chosen by those who associate the longer expression with the numerator.*

**basic:** A=45% B=5% C=35% D=15%
*Reasoning: Students at this level have started to internalise that the divisor goes in the denominator, but "punctuation neglect" is still very high. C remains a powerful distractor because it maps to their left-to-right reading habits.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=2% C=18% D=5%
*Reasoning: Most proficient students recognize the vinculum as a grouping symbol. However, under exam pressure, a significant minority will still revert to "bracket-stripping" and select C, while a few might misidentify the divisor and pick D.*

**advanced:** A=96% B=0% C=3% D=1%
*Reasoning: Advanced students fully understand notational equivalence. The very small percentage of errors would be attributed to "slips" (careless reading) rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.*
