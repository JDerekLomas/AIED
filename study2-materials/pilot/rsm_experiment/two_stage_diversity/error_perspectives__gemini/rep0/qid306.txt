As a Year 9 maths teacher, I have seen these misconceptions play out in every mock exam cycle. Based on the documented BODMAS/PEMDAS "hierarchy trap" where students follow the acronym's literal order rather than the left-to-right convention for equal-priority operations, here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

**Below Basic:** These students often default to a simple left-to-right strategy for all problems, ignoring order of operations entirely, or guess randomly. They are likely to struggle with the multiplication priority in Problem Q.
**Basic:** These students have memorized the acronym (BODMAS) but interpret it as a rigid sequence. They correctly identify that multiplication precedes addition, but they incorrectly believe addition *must* precede subtraction, making Option D the most significant distractor for this group.
**Proficient:** These students generally understand the priority of multiplication over addition, but roughly half will still fall into the "A before S" trap in Problem P when under exam pressure.
**Advanced:** These students understand that Addition/Subtraction and Multiplication/Division are inverse operations with equal priority, resolved via the left-to-right directionality rule.

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=25% C=15% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=55% C=5% D=35%
advanced: A=2% B=94% C=1% D=3%
