As a Year 9 maths teacher, I’ve seen this exact "Denominator Summation" error year after year. The identical denominators in this question actually make the error more prevalent because the lack of "cognitive friction" (no need to find a common denominator) leads students to autopilot through the addition operation. 

Option B is a "distractor of knowledge"—students who can convert to improper fractions but forget the final instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number. Option C catches those who both add denominators and convert incorrectly.

Here is my predicted breakdown based on common Year 9 performance data:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=25% D=45%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=5% D=40%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
