As a Year 9 maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it highlights a rare instance where the "correct" mathematical answer (Option A) actually conflicts with students' learned procedural rituals. While $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ is mathematically equal to $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$, students are trained that a mean calculation must include *every* data point in the sum.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on the five perspectives provided:

**below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=35% D=5%**
Students at this level are heavily susceptible to "Order of Operations" errors. **Option B** is the most popular choice here because it reads left-to-right exactly how a student would type it into a basic calculator ($0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$), unaware that the division would only apply to the 7. Others will fall into the "zero doesn't count" trap, leading to **Option C**.

**basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%**
These students understand that a fraction bar represents division, so they move away from Option B. However, as noted in Perspective 1 and 4, the "Zero-as-Nothing" misconception is strongest at this level. They will sum the non-zero digits to get 15 and intuitively divide by the four "real" numbers they see, making **Option C** the dominant choice.

**proficient: A=35% B=5% C=25% D=35%**
This is where the "conceptual dissonance" described in Perspective 3 and 5 is most evident. These students know they must divide by 5. However, they are often rigid about formal notation. Because the "0" is missing from the numerator of Option A, many will believe it is "incomplete" or a "trick" and reject it in favour of **Option D**. Those who prioritised the divisor ($n=5$) over the missing digit will correctly pick A.

**advanced: A=75% B=2% C=5% D=18%**
The majority of advanced students will recognise that $0+1+3+4+7$ is numerically identical to $1+3+4+7$ and that the denominator of 5 correctly accounts for the five data points. However, a significant minority will over-analyse the question, suspecting a trap regarding "notational completeness," and choose **Option D** because the sum doesn't explicitly show the zero.

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=35% D=05%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
proficient: A=35% B=05% C=25% D=35%
advanced: A=75% B=02% C=05% D=18%
