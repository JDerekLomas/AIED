As a teacher evaluating these Year 9 mocks, this question is a classic test of whether a student's algebraic understanding is robust enough to withstand the "interference" of decimal arithmetic and the visual cues of the coefficient. 

Option B is the correct answer. However, the paths students take to reach it—or to fall into the traps—vary significantly by ability. "Below Basic" students often treat the expression as linear or lose track of decimal places entirely. "Basic" students often succumb to the visual lure of multiplying the coefficient first (Option A). "Proficient" students usually know the order of operations but are the most likely to fall for the place-value trap when squaring $0.3$ (Option D).

Here is the predicted distribution of answers:

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=15% B=55% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=0% D=5%
