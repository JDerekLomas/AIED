As an experienced teacher, I can see that this question perfectly highlights the struggle Year 9 students face when moving from "performing operations" to true fractional understanding. While Option B is the correct answer ($4 \frac{19}{20}$), Option D is a powerful "magnet" distractor that captures those with the common "add across" misconception. Options A and C generally capture those who struggle with the mixed-number-to-improper conversion or fail to find the *lowest* common multiple (using $40$ instead of $20$).

Based on the research perspectives provided and standard UK Year 9 performance data, here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%
basic: A=12% B=38% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=75% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=92% C=2% D=1%
