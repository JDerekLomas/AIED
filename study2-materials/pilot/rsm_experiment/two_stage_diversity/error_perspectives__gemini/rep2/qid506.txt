Based on the insights from the five perspectives, it is clear that the "factor-pair" relationship between 3 and 12 is the primary driver of student error. Option A ($1/4$) is an exceptionally strong distractor because it satisfies the student's intuition that division must occur, but incorrectly applies that division to the denominator itself.

Students at the lower ability levels are likely to ignore the fraction entirely (Option C) or perform a subtraction-based error (Option D). As students progress toward "Proficient," they correctly identify that the answer must be a fraction but fall into the "perceptual association trap" (Option A) by dividing 12 by 3. Only at the Advanced level do students consistently overcome the visual lure of the number 4 to correctly apply the multiplicative identity of the denominator.
