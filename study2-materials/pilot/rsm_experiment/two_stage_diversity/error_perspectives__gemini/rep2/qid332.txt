Based on the analysis of these common misconceptions—particularly the "visual trap" of the vinculum and the tendency to "selectively multiply" to clear fractions—here is the predicted distribution of answers for Year 9 students:

**below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%**
Students at this level often prioritise "getting rid of the fraction" and "moving numbers." They recognise that Tom’s addition and Katie’s multiplication both involve the correct inverse operations in isolation ($12+5$ and $12 \times 3$). Lacking a firm grasp of the property of equality across multiple terms, they are highly likely to find Option C the most "complete" answer.

**basic: A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%**
These students are more confident with Tom’s "standard" method of isolating the variable term first. However, Katie’s suggestion remains a very strong distractor. Because $x - 5 = 36$ looks like a "cleaner" equation, many students at this level will validate it as an alternative "shortcut" method, failing to check if the $-5$ was scaled correctly.

**proficient: A=65% B=5% C=28% D=2%**
Proficient students generally follow a set of reliable procedures. Most will correctly identify Tom’s method as the safest path. However, a significant minority will still fall into the "visual proximity" trap, incorrectly assuming that multiplication by 3 only "cancels" the denominator directly under the $x$, leading them to Option C.

**advanced: A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%**
Advanced students typically recognise that an equation is a balanced scale. They understand that multiplying by 3 is an operation applied to the *entire* side (the distributive law). While a few may make a slip or overthink the validity of "non-standard" steps, the vast majority will identify that Katie failed to multiply the constant term and correctly choose Option A.
