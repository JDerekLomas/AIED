Based on the psychological triggers identified in the five perspectives—specifically "Operation Persistence," "False Symmetry," and the "Addition-First Visual Trap"—here is the predicted performance breakdown for Year 9 students.

**Assessment Analysis:**
The core struggle here is the conflict between visual scanning (left-to-right) and formal hierarchy (BIDMAS/BODMAS). The presence of the brackets on the right side acts as a "suggestive prime," making the incorrect addition-first approach on the left side feel more "natural" to students who have not yet mastered operational priority.

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=10% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=38% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%

**Teacher’s Notes on the Data:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students almost exclusively follow a "Left-to-Right" processing model. They see the numbers as identical and assume equality (C) without deep calculation, or they guess (A) or (D) based on the "size" of the expression.
*   **Basic:** This group often performs the calculation on the right correctly ($20 \div 4 = 5$) but is highly susceptible to the "Grouping Bias" mentioned in Perspective 1. They treat the left side as identical to the right, leading to a high percentage of (C) answers.
*   **Proficient:** These students recognize BIDMAS is required. However, the "Distributive Illusion" (Perspective 4) still trips up a significant minority who may intuitively "calculate" $11$ vs $5$ but doubt themselves because the symmetry of the digits $8, 12, 4$ is so visually compelling.
*   **Advanced:** These students bypass the visual Gestalt traps and systematically apply order of operations to both sides ($8 + 3 = 11$ vs $20 \div 4 = 5$), confidently selecting (A).
