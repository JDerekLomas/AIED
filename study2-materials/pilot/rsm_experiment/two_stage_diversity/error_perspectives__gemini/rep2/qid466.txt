As an experienced teacher, looking at these perspectives highlights the complex interplay between reciprocal recall and integer sign laws. 

In Year 9, students in the **below_basic** bracket often default to "visual matching" (choosing the same numbers they see) or are overwhelmed by the fraction structure, leading to an even split between the distractors. Those at the **basic** level usually recognize the need for a reciprocal but are most susceptible to Perspective 4 and 5—the "negative theme" trap where they feel the answer *must* be negative because the input and output are.

**Proficient** students usually understand the reciprocal must be $\frac{4}{3}$, but Perspective 3 identifies their main struggle: the "identity confusion." They often calculate for $+1$ by default and then fail to adjust for the negative product. **Advanced** students should navigate the sign-parity rules accurately, though a small minority will make a "slip" by over-thinking the additive inverse.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=45% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=35% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=6% C=1% D=1%
