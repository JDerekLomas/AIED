As a Year 9 teacher, I’ve seen these exact misconceptions play out time and again. The standard form ($Ax + By = C$) is notoriously difficult for students compared to the slope-intercept form they are most comfortable with. 

The inclusion of $D = 2.5$ is a particularly clever distractor that targets the $x/y$ substitution swap, while $A = 20$ preys on those who struggle with inverse operations. At the 'Below Basic' level, many students view algebra as a series of guesses based on the numbers visible on the page, often ignoring the structure of the equation entirely.

Here is my predicted distribution of responses based on the common pedagogical traps identified:

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=45% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=75% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
