As a teacher who has marked countless Year 9 papers, I recognise this question as a classic "separator." It doesn't just test algebra; it tests the resilience of a student's logical process against the pull of intuitive, but incorrect, arithmetic. 

For many students, the "niceness" of the result $10 \div 5 = 2$ acts as a cognitive trap. Even those who theoretically know how to manipulate equations often abandon their training when an easy, whole-number answer appears to be sitting right in front of them. The "unknown in the denominator" is notoriously the most difficult linear equation structure for Key Stage 3 students to master.

Based on the research perspectives provided and standard UK mock exam data, here is the predicted performance breakdown:

below_basic: A=10% B=35% C=50% D=5%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=10% C=33% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=6% D=0%
