Based on the perspectives provided and typical Year 9 mock exam performance patterns, here is the predicted percentage breakdown for each ability level.

**below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%**
Students at this level are highly susceptible to "adding across" (Option B) as they treat the $x$ as a label and add the 2 and the implicit 1 in the denominator. Others will choose Option D, using the "matching" logic where they add the numerators but simply pick the most "complex" denominator they can see ($2x$).

**basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%**
These students have a surface-level understanding that they shouldn't necessarily add denominators, but the "visual trap" of the matching $x$ variable described in Perspective 3 is strongest here. Many will successfully identify $2x$ as a suitable denominator but fail to scale the numerator of the second fraction, leading them directly to Option D.

**proficient: A=70% B=5% C=5% D=20%**
Proficient students generally understand the need for a common denominator. However, under exam pressure, a significant minority will still fall for the "partial matching" error (Option D). A small number may over-complicate the LCM (Perspective 2) and arrive at an incorrect simplification like Option C.

**advanced: A=94% B=1% C=2% D=3%**
Advanced students will immediately identify the LCM as $2x$ and correctly scale the second fraction. The few errors made at this level are usually "slips" rather than conceptual misunderstandings, perhaps losing the coefficient during a final mental check (Option C) or a rare lapse in focus resulting in Option D.
