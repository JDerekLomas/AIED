As an experienced teacher marking Year 9 mocks, I have observed that this specific problem—adding mixed numbers with common denominators—is a notorious "confidence trap." While stronger students see it as an easy mark, those with lingering misconceptions about the nature of denominators are frequently lured in by the symmetry of the digits.

Based on the perspectives provided and standard UK Year 9 performance data, here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=0% D=15%
advanced: A=92% B=7% C=0% D=1%

**Analysis for my mark book:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the "mixed" nature of the notation. Many will attempt to turn everything into a whole number or, as noted in the perspectives, add every digit they see ($2+1+1+2+5+5$) or simply add across every level, leading to the high percentage for D and C.
*   **Basic:** This group usually understands that $2+1=3$, but they lack the conceptual "unit" understanding of the denominator. As Perspective 1 and 2 highlight, the "symmetry" of the 5s is a trigger for the addition trap. They are the group most likely to choose D.
*   **Proficient:** Most will get this right. Those who don't usually fail due to "autopilot" errors (Perspective 1)—seeing the question as too easy and neglecting to switch off their whole-number addition brain. Some may convert to improper fractions and stop at $\frac{18}{5}$ (Option B) despite the instruction to leave it as a mixed number.
*   **Advanced:** Almost all will select A. The few who select B will likely have misread the "leave as a mixed number" instruction in their haste.
