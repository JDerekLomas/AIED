Based on the analysis of these perspectives and my experience with Year 9 mock exams, here is the predicted percentage breakdown for each ability level.

The "below_basic" cohort often follows a simple left-to-right processing (Option B), ignoring order of operations entirely. The "basic" and "proficient" cohorts are the most susceptible to the "A before S" BODMAS trap (Option D), while the "advanced" cohort typically understands the left-to-right rule for operations of equal priority.

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=15% B=25% C=10% D=50%
proficient: A=45% B=10% C=5% D=40%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=1% D=5%
