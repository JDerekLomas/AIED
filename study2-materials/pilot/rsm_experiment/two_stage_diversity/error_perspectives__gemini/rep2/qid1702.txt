Based on the analysis of these pedagogical perspectives and typical Year 9 mock exam data, here is the predicted percentage distribution for each ability level.

The distractors are highly effective: **Option B** targets those who substitute into the wrong variable ($x$ instead of $y$) and round their result. **Option D** targets those who substitute correctly but fail the additive inverse operation ($30 - 3$ instead of $30 + 3$). **Option A** captures students making a combination of sign errors and variable mismatches.
