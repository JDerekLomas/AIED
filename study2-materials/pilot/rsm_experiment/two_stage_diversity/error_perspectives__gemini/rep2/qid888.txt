Based on the detailed pedagogical analysis provided and common trends observed in Year 9 mock exams, here is the predicted percentage breakdown for each ability level:

**below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=20% D=40%**
Students at this level often struggle with the core "FOIL" process itself. Many will incorrectly find the difference between 5 and 7 (Option A) or struggle with the concept of directed numbers entirely, picking C because they've heard "two negatives make a positive" and apply it indiscriminately to every term. Option D remains the most common error due to "sign persistence" from the visual structure of the question.

**basic: A=10% B=30% C=10% D=50%**
These students usually know they need to add and multiply the numbers. They will correctly identify "12" and "35," but as highlighted in all five perspectives, they are the most likely to fall for the "notational trap." They successfully calculate $-12m$ and then assume the negative sign must "persist" for the constant term, making Option D the highest-functioning distractor.

**proficient: A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%**
Proficient students generally have a solid grasp of binomial expansion. However, under exam pressure (cognitive load), a significant minority will still commit the "sign interference" error. They know the rules, but the momentum of calculating the $-12m$ middle term causes a temporary lapse in arithmetic when multiplying $(-5) \times (-7)$.

**advanced: A=0% B=92% C=0% D=8%**
Advanced students are highly likely to get this right as they have automated the rules for directed numbers. The small percentage choosing Option D would typically be due to a "silly mistake" or lack of checking, rather than a fundamental misunderstanding of the distributive law or integer arithmetic.

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=10% D=50%
proficient: A=05% B=65% C=05% D=25%
advanced: A=00% B=92% C=00% D=08%
