Based on the detailed pedagogical insights provided and typical Year 9 mock exam performance data in the UK, here is the predicted percentage distribution for each ability level.

**below_basic:** A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
*At this level, "Operator Fixation" and "Additive Bias" (Perspective 1 & 2) are dominant. Most students will see the $60$, the $1$, and the $+$ sign and instinctively feel that $61$ is the natural "answer" to that combination, leading them to validate both steps.*

**basic:** A=30% B=10% C=50% D=10%
*Students here are starting to recognize inverse operations (Perspective 5) but often succumb to the "Side-Switch Myth." The numerical "smoothness" of moving from 60 to 61 (Perspective 4) acts as a strong distractor, leading many to still choose C.*

**proficient:** A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
*Most proficient students will correctly identify that Step 2 requires the subtraction of 1 ($60 - 1 = 59$). However, the "right-handed" nature of the equation (Perspective 3) still trips up a quarter of the cohort, who mistakenly believe Step 2 is a correct application of a "balancing" rule.*

**advanced:** A=92% B=2% C=4% D=2%
*Advanced students are much less likely to fall for notational traps or additive bias. They will see the vinculum correctly and understand the need for the additive inverse, though a tiny percentage may still make a high-speed "cognitive closure" error (Perspective 4).*
