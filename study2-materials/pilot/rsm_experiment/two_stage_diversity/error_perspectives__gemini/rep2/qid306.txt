As a mathematics teacher, I have marked countless mock exams where the "BODMAS trap" consistently trips up students, even those who appear confident with basic arithmetic. The perspectives provided highlight a classic case where a mnemonic, intended as a helpful tool, becomes a cognitive barrier.

In **Problem P**, the "A before S" literalism is the primary driver of error. Many students across the lower to middle ability ranges will instinctively gravitate toward the addition, either because of the alphabetical order of the acronym or a subconscious desire to avoid the directed numbers involved in \(4-5\). In **Problem Q**, however, the mnemonic "works" (Multiplication before Addition), meaning many students will choose the correct first step for Q while failing P. This makes **Option D** the most significant "distractor" in the set.

Based on typical Year 9 performance data and the specific cognitive hurdles identified, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=25% D=45%
basic: A=5% B=30% C=10% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=2% B=92% C=1% D=5%
