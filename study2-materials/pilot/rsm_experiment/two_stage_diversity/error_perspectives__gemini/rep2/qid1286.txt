Based on the detailed analysis of common algebraic misconceptions regarding fractional coefficients, the placement of $\pi$ in formula rearrangement, and the "coefficient inversion" trap, here is the predicted performance for Year 9 students:

below_basic: A=45% B=25% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=35% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=30% C=50% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=10% C=84% D=1%
