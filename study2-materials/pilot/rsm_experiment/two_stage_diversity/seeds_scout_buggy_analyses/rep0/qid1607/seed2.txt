## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps.
The specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps is that he incorrectly applied the operation to isolate \(k\). In Step 1, he multiplied both sides of the equation \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\) by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which is correct: \(15 \times 4 = 1 + k\), resulting in \(60 = 1 + k\). This step is correct.

## 2: Analyze Step 2 for any misconception or error.
In Step 2, Isaac subtracts 1 from both sides to solve for \(k\): \(60 - 1 = k\), which gives \(59 = k\). However, Isaac wrote \(61 = k\), indicating a mistake. The correct calculation is \(60 - 1 = 59\), not \(61\). This shows Isaac made a calculation error in Step 2.

## 3: Describe the misconception or procedural error precisely.
The error is a simple arithmetic mistake in Step 2, where Isaac incorrectly calculated \(k\). The correct step should have been: \(60 = 1 + k \Rightarrow 60 - 1 = k \Rightarrow 59 = k\). The bug here is not a deep-seated misconception but a straightforward arithmetic error.

## 4: Explain how a student with this misconception would work through the question.
A student with a tendency to make arithmetic errors or who is not meticulous in their calculations might work through the question as follows:
1. Start with \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\).
2. Multiply both sides by 4 to get \(60 = 1 + k\), which is correct.
3. Then, to isolate \(k\), they subtract 1 from both sides. If they are prone to errors, they might mistakenly write \(61 = k\) instead of doing the correct subtraction: \(60 - 1 = 59\).

## 5: Determine which answer option the misconception leads to.
Given Isaac's steps:
- Step 1 is correct.
- Step 2 is incorrect due to an arithmetic mistake.

Thus, the student would realize only Step 1 is correct, leading to answer option A: Only step 1.

## 6: Evaluate how natural or attractive this error is.
This error is relatively common and can be attractive because it involves a simple arithmetic operation that students may perform hastily or without sufficient checking. The mistake of calculating \(k = 61\) instead of \(k = 59\) might not be immediately obvious to a student who does not double-check their work, making it a natural pitfall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
