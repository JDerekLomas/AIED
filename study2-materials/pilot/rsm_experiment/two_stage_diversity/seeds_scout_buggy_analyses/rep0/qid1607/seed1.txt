## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps is the incorrect manipulation of the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \) to solve for \( k \). The error occurs in both steps but is most directly evident in how the equation is transformed.

## 2: Analyze Isaac's steps to pinpoint the error.
In Step 1, Isaac multiplies both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which is a correct procedure: \( 15 \times 4 = (1 + k) \), resulting in \( 60 = 1 + k \). This step is correct.

## 3: Identify the error in the subsequent step.
The error occurs in Step 2, where Isaac solves for \( k \) by adding 1 to both sides of the equation \( 60 = 1 + k \), which would actually result in \( 60 - 1 = k \) or \( 59 = k \), not \( 61 = k \) as Isaac writes. The correct calculation is \( k = 60 - 1 = 59 \), but Isaac incorrectly states \( k = 61 \).

## 4: Determine which steps, if any, are correct based on the analysis.
Given the analysis, Step 1 is correct because multiplying both sides by 4 yields \( 60 = 1 + k \). However, Step 2 is incorrect because it incorrectly solves for \( k \) as \( 61 \) instead of \( 59 \).

## 5: Describe the misconception.
The misconception here seems to be a simple arithmetic error rather than a deep-seated misconception about algebraic procedures. The bug can be described as a misapplication of basic algebraic operations or a simple mistake in solving for \( k \).

## 6: Explain how a student with this misconception would work through the question.
A student with this type of error might misunderstand the operation needed to isolate \( k \), or they might simply make a careless mistake in their calculations. They would start with the correct multiplication to clear the fraction but then incorrectly solve for \( k \).

## 7: Determine which answer option the misconception leads to.
Given that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect, the correct answer is A) Only step 1.

## 8: Assess how natural/attractive this error is.
This error is relatively common and might not be immediately obvious to the student as an error because it involves a simple, easy-to-make arithmetic mistake. Students often struggle with keeping track of operations, especially when they are solving equations, and this mistake can easily occur if they are not careful.

The best answer is A.
