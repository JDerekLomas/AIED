## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps.
The specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps is the incorrect handling of the equation \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \) when solving for \( k \). In Step 1, Isaac multiplies both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which is correct: \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \), resulting in \( 60 = 1 + k \). This step is correct.

## 2: Analyze Step 2 for any misconception or error.
In Step 2, Isaac subtracts 1 from both sides to solve for \( k \): \( 60 - 1 = k \), which gives \( 59 = k \). However, Isaac writes \( 61 = k \), indicating he added 1 to both sides instead of subtracting, which is incorrect.

## 3: Describe the misconception.
The misconception here is not about the operation applied (as the operation of subtracting 1 from both sides or adding 1 to both sides could be considered, but the actual mistake was in the execution) but seems to be about correctly applying algebraic operations. However, precisely, the error might seem to stem from simple arithmetic mistake rather than a deep-seated algebraic misconception.

## 4: Determine how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with a similar misconception (e.g., confusion with operational procedures) would:
1. Start with the given equation: \( 15 = \frac{1 + k}{4} \)
2. Multiply both sides by 4: \( 60 = 1 + k \), which is correct.
3. Then, to solve for \( k \), they should subtract 1 from both sides: \( 60 - 1 = k \), resulting in \( k = 59 \). But if they mistakenly add 1 (or similarly misinterpret the operation), they could get \( k = 61 \) as Isaac did.

## 5: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given Isaac's steps:
- Step 1 is correct.
- Step 2 is incorrect because \( k = 59 \), not \( k = 61 \).

So, a student recognizing the error in Step 2 but not identifying a deeper misconception would choose A) Only step 1.

## 6: Assess how natural/attractive this error is.
This error can be considered relatively natural because it involves a simple arithmetic oversight (adding instead of subtracting) rather than a fundamental misunderstanding of algebraic principles. A student might easily overlook subtracting 1 or get confused with the signs/operations, especially under time pressure or when not thoroughly checking their work.

The best answer is A.
