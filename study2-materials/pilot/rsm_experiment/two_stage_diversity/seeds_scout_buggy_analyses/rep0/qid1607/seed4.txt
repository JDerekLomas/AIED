## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps.
The specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps is related to the incorrect application of inverse operations to solve for \(k\). In Step 1, Isaac correctly multiplies both sides of the equation \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\) by 4 to get rid of the fraction, resulting in \(60 = 1 + k\). However, the error occurs in Step 2 when he solves for \(k\). The correct step to solve for \(k\) would be to subtract 1 from both sides, yielding \(k = 59\). Isaac, however, adds 1 to both sides implicitly (or simply adds 60 + 1), which is incorrect.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
A student with the misconception might proceed as follows:
1. Start with the given equation: \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\).
2. Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction: \(15 \times 4 = 1 + k\), which simplifies to \(60 = 1 + k\).
3. Instead of subtracting 1 from both sides to isolate \(k\), the student might think to add 1 to both sides or simply get confused and add 1 to 60 (implicitly or explicitly), yielding \(k = 61\).

## 3: Determine which answer option (A/B/C/D) this misconception leads to.
Isaac's steps are:
- Step 1: \(60 = 1 + k\), which is correct.
- Step 2: \(61 = k\), which is incorrect because the correct calculation is \(k = 60 - 1 = 59\).
Thus, only Step 1 is correct, and Step 2 is incorrect. This leads to answer option A: Only step 1.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural, especially for students who are still solidifying their understanding of inverse operations and algebraic manipulations. The mistake of adding instead of subtracting (or vice versa) is common, especially under time pressure or when not thoroughly checking work. A student with this misconception might not immediately realize they went wrong, especially if they are used to operations being symmetric or if they're in a hurry. The error seems attractive because it's a simple miscalculation that can easily occur if one is not carefully checking each step of their solution.

The best answer is A.
