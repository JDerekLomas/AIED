## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps.
The specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps is the incorrect handling of the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \) when isolating \( k \). In Step 1, Isaac multiplies both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which is correct: \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \), resulting in \( 60 = 1 + k \). This step is mathematically correct.

## 2: Analyze Step 2 for any procedural errors.
In Step 2, Isaac subtracts 1 from both sides to solve for \( k \), which gives \( 60 - 1 = k \), resulting in \( 59 = k \). However, Isaac writes \( 61 = k \), indicating he added 1 instead of subtracting 1 from 60. The correct operation to isolate \( k \) is \( 60 - 1 = k \), but Isaac mistakenly states \( 61 = k \) as his solution.

## 3: Describe the misconception.
The misconception here seems to be a simple arithmetic mistake rather than a deep-seated misconception about algebraic procedures. Isaac correctly applies the multiplication to clear the fraction but then makes a basic arithmetic error in solving for \( k \).

## 4: Detail how a student with this misconception would work through the question.
A student with this type of misconception would:
1. Start with the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \).
2. Multiply both sides by 4 to get \( 60 = 1 + k \), which is correct.
3. Then, to solve for \( k \), they would incorrectly add 1 to both sides (or simply add 1 to 60) instead of subtracting 1, leading to \( k = 61 \) instead of \( k = 59 \).

## 5: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect due to a simple arithmetic mistake, the student would consider Step 1 correct but Step 2 wrong. This leads to the conclusion that only Step 1 is correct.

## 6: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is relatively common, especially under time pressure or when not fully attentive to detail. A student might not immediately realize their mistake if they are focused on applying procedures rather than checking their arithmetic. The mistake seems minor and could easily go unnoticed, especially if the student is confident in their method but not in their arithmetic.

## 7: Conclude which of the provided answer options (A/B/C/D) is correct based on the analysis.
Given that Step 1 is correct and Step 2 is incorrect, the correct answer is A) Only step 1.

The best answer is A.
