## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is the incorrect handling of signs when multiplying two negative numbers. The bug here could be referred to as "ignoring the sign change when multiplying two negatives." When multiplying two negative numbers, the result is positive, but a common misconception is to either forget to change the sign or to incorrectly apply the sign rules.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
To multiply the terms indicated by the arrows, which are \(-1\) and \(-4\), a student with the misconception of ignoring the sign change might think:
1. Multiplying \(-1\) by \(-4\) gives \(4\), because they ignore the rule that two negative numbers multiplied together give a positive result.
2. The correct calculation should be: \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\), which is correct but let's assume the student mistakenly thinks it's \(-1 \times -4 = -4\) due to a misapplication of sign rules or simply forgetting that negatives times negatives equals positives.

However, let's correct and specify the bug: A more precise bug could be "adding the numbers and keeping the negative sign" or simply failing to recognize that multiplying two negatives yields a positive. So, the step-by-step with the misconception might look like:
- The student sees \(-1\) and \(-4\).
- They think, "I just need to multiply these," but then mistakenly write \(-1 \times -4 = -5\) or simply \(+4\) if they correctly change the signs but miscalculate the rest of the FOIL process.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
If the student mistakenly calculates \(-1 \times -4\) as \(-4\) (due to a bug where they incorrectly apply or forget the rule for multiplying two negative numbers), they would choose:
B) \( -4 \)

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is.
This error can be quite natural and attractive, especially for students who are still developing their understanding of integer operations and algebraic manipulations. The mistake of forgetting to apply the correct sign change when multiplying two negatives is common because it requires a solid understanding of the rules of arithmetic operations on integers. Students might easily get confused, especially under test conditions or when working quickly, and not realize they've made a mistake unless they're checking their work carefully. The error seems plausible because students often struggle with applying sign rules consistently across different operations.

The best answer is B.
