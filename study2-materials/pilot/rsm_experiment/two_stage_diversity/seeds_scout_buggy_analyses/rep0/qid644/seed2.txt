## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this scenario is the confusion between the rules of adding and multiplying negative numbers, specifically the misconception that multiplying two negative numbers results in a negative number instead of a positive number.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step
A student with this misconception would multiply the two terms indicated by the arrows: \(-1 \times -4\). Normally, a student would recall that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result: \(-1 \times -4 = 4\). However, the student with the misconception would incorrectly apply the rule and think: \(-1 \times -4 = -4\), because they mistakenly believe that two negative numbers multiplied together yield a negative result.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
Given the incorrect calculation \(-1 \times -4 = -4\), the student's answer would match option B: \(-4\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong
This error can be quite natural and attractive to students who have not fully understood or consolidated the rules of signs in multiplication. The student might not even realize they went wrong because the mistake involves a fundamental misunderstanding of a basic mathematical operation. Many students struggle with remembering that two negatives make a positive, and this struggle can lead to persistent misconceptions. The student might feel confident in their answer because it aligns with an incorrect but seemingly logical application of their understanding of negative numbers.

The best answer is B.
