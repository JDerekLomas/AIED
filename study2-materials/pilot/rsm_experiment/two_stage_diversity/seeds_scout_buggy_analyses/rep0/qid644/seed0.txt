## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this scenario is the incorrect handling of signs when multiplying two negative numbers. The bug here could be that the student forgets or misunderstands that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
To multiply the terms indicated by the arrows, which are -1 and -4, a student with the misconception might think:
-1 * -4 = -5 (because they incorrectly apply the rule that two negatives make a negative, which is a common mistake)

However, the correct step should be:
-1 * -4 = 4 (because two negatives multiplied together give a positive)

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the incorrect calculation -1 * -4 = -5, the student would select option D: -5.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it's a common misconception to confuse the rules of signs in multiplication. Students might be used to seeing that adding or subtracting two negative numbers results in a negative number, and mistakenly apply this logic to multiplication. The student might not even realize they went wrong, especially if they are confident in their sign rules for addition and subtraction but haven't fully consolidated the rules for multiplication. This misconception could lead to a sense of consistency with other operations involving negatives, making it less noticeable to the student.

The best answer is D.
