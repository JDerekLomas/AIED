## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this situation is the incorrect handling of the signs when multiplying two negative numbers. The bug here could be described as "failure to apply the rule for multiplying negative numbers" or more specifically, thinking that multiplying two negative numbers results in a negative number instead of a positive one.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step
A student with this misconception would see the terms indicated by the arrows as -1 and -4. When multiplying these two terms, instead of applying the correct rule that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result, they might incorrectly think:
\[ -1 \times -4 = -4 \]
So, they would consider the product of -1 and -4 to be -4.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
Based on the incorrect calculation:
\[ -1 \times -4 = -4 \]
This leads directly to answer option B: \( -4 \).

## 4: Assess how natural or attractive this error is
This error can be quite natural or attractive because it stems from a common misunderstanding of the rules for multiplying integers, particularly with negative numbers. Many students initially struggle with the concept that two negative numbers multiplied together yield a positive result. This misconception might not be immediately obvious to the student as incorrect because it feels intuitive to some that two negatives should yield a negative, similar to how subtraction works. Therefore, a student holding this misconception might not even realize they went wrong, making it a plausible and insidious error.

The best answer is B.
