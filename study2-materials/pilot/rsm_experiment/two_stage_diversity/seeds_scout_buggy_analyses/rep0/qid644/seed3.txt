## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this scenario is the incorrect handling of signs when multiplying two negative numbers. The bug here could be the failure to recognize that multiplying two negative numbers yields a positive result.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
A student with this misconception might think as follows:
- The terms indicated by the arrows are -1 and -4.
- When multiplying these two terms, the student might incorrectly think that the result of multiplying two negative numbers is negative, instead of positive.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Following the incorrect logic from Step 2, the student would calculate \(-1 \times -4 = -4\), because they incorrectly believe that multiplying two negative numbers gives a negative result.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural or attractive to students who have not fully grasped the rule about multiplying negative numbers. Many students initially struggle with the concept that two negatives make a positive. If a student holds this misconception, they might not even realize they went wrong because their calculations seem to follow a logical (though incorrect) pattern. The correct calculation, \(-1 \times -4 = 4\), is often less intuitive for struggling students.

## 5: Match the misconception to the provided answer options.
Given that the student incorrectly calculates \(-1 \times -4\) as \(-4\), the answer they would choose is B: \(-4\).

The best answer is B.
