## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this scenario is adding the numerators and denominators separately without finding a common denominator. This is often referred to as the "additive property" misconception, where students incorrectly apply the rule that \(\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d}\).

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
A student with this misconception would work through the question as follows:
1. Start with the given expression: \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\)
2. Incorrectly add the numerators (3 + 4) and the denominators (2x + x) separately:
\(\frac{3+4}{2x+x} = \frac{7}{3x}\)

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to
This misconception leads to answer option B: \(\frac{7}{3x}\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves a simple and consistent (though incorrect) application of a rule. Students might not realize they went wrong because the operation seems analogous to adding fractions with the same denominator, and they might not check their work against the rules for adding fractions with different denominators. The mistake seems logical at first glance, which can make it difficult for students to identify as an error without further guidance or checking their solution against examples or the correct procedure.

The best answer is B.
