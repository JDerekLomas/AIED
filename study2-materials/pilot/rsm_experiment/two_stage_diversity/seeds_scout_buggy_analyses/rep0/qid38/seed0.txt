## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is adding the fractions by simply adding the numerators and the denominators separately, without finding a common denominator. This can be referred to as the "naive addition" bug.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with the "naive addition" bug would work through the question as follows:
1. Start with the given expression: \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\)
2. Add the numerators: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
3. Add the denominators: \(2x + x = 3x\)
4. Write the result as a single fraction: \(\frac{7}{3x}\)

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Based on the steps described, this misconception leads to answer option B: \(\frac{7}{3x}\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is quite natural and attractive because it involves a simple and intuitive operation (adding numerators and denominators separately), which can seem logical at first glance, especially for students who are not yet fully comfortable with the procedures for adding fractions with different denominators. Students might not realize they went wrong because the result seems to follow a straightforward, albeit incorrect, application of arithmetic operations. It requires a good understanding of fractions and their properties to recognize that the correct approach involves finding a common denominator.

The best answer is B.
