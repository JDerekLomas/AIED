## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is adding the numerators and denominators separately without finding a common denominator. This can be described as the "separate addition" bug.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
A student with the "separate addition" bug would add the fractions as follows:
- Start with \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \)
- Add the numerators: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
- Add the denominators: \(2x + x = 3x\)
- Resulting fraction: \( \frac{7}{3x} \)

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to
This misconception leads directly to answer option B: \( \frac{7}{3x} \).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves a simple and seemingly logical operation (adding the parts together), which might seem correct at first glance, especially to students who are not yet comfortable with the algebraic manipulation of fractions or have not fully grasped the concept of finding a common denominator. Students might not realize they went wrong because the operation seems straightforward and aligns with addition in other contexts (like adding whole numbers), making it a plausible mistake.

The best answer is B.
