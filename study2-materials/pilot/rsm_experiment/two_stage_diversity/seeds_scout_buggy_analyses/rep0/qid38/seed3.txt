## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is adding the fractions by simply adding the numerators and denominators separately, without finding a common denominator. This can be referred to as the "naive addition" bug.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with the "naive addition" bug would work through the question as follows:

1. Start with the given expression: \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\)
2. Add the numerators: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
3. Add the denominators: \(2x + x = 3x\)
4. Write the result as a single fraction: \(\frac{7}{3x}\)

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Based on the steps described, the misconception leads to answer option B: \(\frac{7}{3x}\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves a simple and straightforward approach that seems to work for adding fractions with the same denominator. However, the student might not realize they went wrong if they are not familiar with the rule that fractions must have a common denominator to be added directly. The error seems logical at first glance because it incorrectly applies the concept of adding like terms. Students might not catch this mistake unless they are specifically taught about common denominators or unless they derive the correct solution through another method and compare.

The best answer is B.
