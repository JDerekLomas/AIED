## Step 1: Identifying the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply when adding fractions is "adding the denominators and the numerators separately without finding a common denominator first, assuming the denominators can simply average out or ignoring the need for a common base for addition."

## 2: Describing the mistaken procedure step by step
If a student mistakenly applied this buggy procedure (though more common as incorrectly applying operations or forgetting the common base in an algebraic setting):
- Start with the expression \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\)
- Misguided step: Ignoring finding a common denominator, to "simplify," they might subtract/add exponents of \(x\), ignore the coefficients in denominators, or directly add/mix them incorrectly. 
- Common Error: The common mistake here would actually likely involve: 
1. Converting both fractions to have an improper/no additional common denominator step; just directly summing it,
so thinking it as (\(3 + 4)/(2 + 1) =\frac{3+4}{2+1}\) in a mistaken thought regarding averages of fractions’ parts.

## 3. Working through the mistaken procedure for steps
Applying the (most classic and fitting here) confusion related misunderstanding in fractions by assuming to average the terms misguided from
an incorrect generalization : Given 
(a + b) fraction 
They go then, direct to \(\frac{3} { (2}x} to   \( 1 as) then \( {add   fractions   and then \text{(or  directly compute like } 
a : direct;  misconcept  } \(\  then    .   .   then; they get (a to: The common   error; add   ,   \(
