## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply is incorrectly adding the whole numbers and fractions separately without finding a common denominator for the fractions, but more specifically, adding the fractions by simply adding the numerators and denominators directly or misinterpreting the mixed numbers as improper fractions and then mishandling them.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with the misconception might work through the question as follows:
- Convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions: \(2 \frac{1}{5} = \frac{(2*5) + 1}{5} = \frac{11}{5}\) and \(1 \frac{2}{5} = \frac{(1*5) + 2}{5} = \frac{7}{5}\).
- Then, add these improper fractions: \(\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{11+7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}\).
- The student might not convert \(\frac{18}{5}\) back to a mixed number properly or recognize it as \(3 \frac{3}{5}\).

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
This misconception leads directly to answer option B: \(\frac{18}{5}\), as the student correctly converted to improper fractions and added them but did not convert back to a mixed number.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural, especially if the student is comfortable with converting between mixed numbers and improper fractions but forgets to finalize the answer in the requested format or does not see the mixed number conversion. The student might not even realize they went wrong if they are not asked to leave the answer in a mixed number format or if they're used to working with improper fractions. However, upon reflection or if prompted to provide the answer in a mixed number format, they might catch the oversight.

The best answer is B.
