## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error in this context is the incorrect handling of the division and addition within the context of algebraic expressions, specifically ignoring the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) and mishandling the distribution of operations. A common misconception is treating the division as if it applies to only part of the expression or incorrectly applying operations due to a misunderstanding of algebraic notation.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
A student with the misconception might interpret \( c \div (h + 4) \) as \( \frac{c}{h} + 4 \). This is due to incorrectly applying the division to \( c \) and \( h \) separately and then adding 4. The steps might look like this:
1. Start with \( c \div (h + 4) \)
2. Split the division into \( \frac{c}{h} + 4 \), assuming the division \( c \div h \) and then adding 4.

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to
This misconception leads to answer option C: \( \frac{c}{h} + 4 \). The student might genuinely believe that splitting the operations in such a manner is correct due to a misunderstanding of how algebraic expressions and the order of operations (BODMAS/BPEMDAS) work.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
The error leading to option C is quite natural and attractive because it reflects a common misunderstanding of algebraic notation and operations. Students often struggle with prioritizing the division over addition within parentheses and may intuitively try to separate operations in a way that seems logical but does not adhere to algebraic conventions. This misconception is attractive because it looks like a simple and sensible way to break down the expression, and without a solid grasp of order of operations or experience with similar problems, a student may not immediately realize their mistake.

The best answer is C.
