## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error relevant to this question is the incorrect handling of the division of a variable by an expression, specifically misinterpreting \( c \div (h + 4) \) by incorrectly applying the distributive property or misplacing the operation. A common bug is treating the division as if it were a multiplication when writing the expression in fraction form, or simply not following the order of operations correctly.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question
A student with the misconception might start by seeing \( c \div (h + 4) \) as \( c \) divided by \( h \) plus \( 4 \), essentially thinking of the division distributing across the addition inside the parentheses incorrectly. This misunderstanding leads the student to evaluate the expression as \( \frac{c}{h} + 4 \) instead of properly writing it as \( \frac{c}{h+4} \).

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
Given the misconception described, the student would likely choose option C: \( \frac{c}{h} + 4 \), as this reflects the incorrect distribution or separation of operations.

## 4: Assess how natural or attractive this error is and whether the student realizes they went wrong
This error can be quite natural or attractive because it seems intuitive to apply operations in a more separated manner, especially for students who are not fully comfortable with the notation of algebra or the strict order of operations. The student might not even realize they went wrong because their calculation seems logical at first glance: "divide \( c \) by \( h \) and then add \( 4 \)" appears to follow a straightforward, if misguided, interpretation of the given expression. Recognizing this as an error often requires an understanding of the algebraic conventions that dictate expressions like \( c \div (h + 4) \) must be evaluated as a fraction where \( h + 4 \) is the denominator, not splitting the operation in the manner described.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
