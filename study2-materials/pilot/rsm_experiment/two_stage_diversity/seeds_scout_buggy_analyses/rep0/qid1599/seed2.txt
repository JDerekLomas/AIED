## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error in this context is the incorrect handling of the division by an expression, specifically treating \( c \div (h + 4) \) as if it allows for the distribution of the division across the addition inside the parentheses in an improper way, or simply misinterpreting the order of operations. A common error related to this is incorrectly adding or subtracting within the numerator or denominator without proper distribution or order of operations. A specific bug here could be adding 4 to \( c \) instead of properly representing \( c \div (h + 4) \).

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with the misconception might think: "When I see \( c \div (h + 4) \), I should add 4 to \( c \)" because they mistakenly believe addition and subtraction operations should directly involve numbers being divided or multiplied together without considering the algebraic convention properly. Therefore, they might write \( c \div (h + 4) \) as \( \frac{c + 4}{h + 4} \) thinking they are just performing the operation as instructed.

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
This misconception leads the student to option B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \). The student mistakenly incorporates the 4 from \( (h + 4) \) into the numerator.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves a straightforward but incorrect application of basic arithmetic operations to algebraic expressions. Students often struggle with maintaining the correct order of operations and properly applying algebraic conventions. Moreover, the structure of the expressions and the expectation of how numbers and variables should interact can lead students to mistakenly adjust the numerator or denominator without realizing it contradicts algebraic rules. It might not be immediately apparent to the student that they've made a mistake, especially if they are not well-versed in checking their work against established algebraic conventions.

The best answer is B.
