## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this scenario is confusing the exponentiation with multiplication by the exponent. Specifically, for the equation \(y = 3x^2\), a common mistake could be to calculate \(y\) as \(3 \times x^2\) but then mistakenly think this equates to \(3x \times 2\) or simply multiplying \(3x\) by \(2\) due to not fully understanding the order of operations or the meaning of the exponent. However, a more likely and direct mistake for a student to make in this context, given the provided options and typical errors, would be simply applying linear thinking where \(y\) is directly proportional to \(x\), or misinterpreting \(x^2\) as \(2x\), leading to a calculation mistake.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
Let's say a student mistakenly believes \(y = 3x^2\) can be simplified to \(y = 6x\) (which is a clear indication of misunderstanding the exponentiation). Here’s how they might work through the question:
- Given \(x = 0.3\), they substitute \(x\) into what they mistakenly think is the correct formula: \(y = 6x\).
- So, \(y = 6 \times 0.3\).

## 3: Calculate the result using the misconception and identify which answer option it leads to.
Using the mistaken formula \(y = 6x\):
- \(y = 6 \times 0.3 = 1.8\).

This calculation leads to answer option C: \(1.8\).

## 4: Evaluate how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error, where \(y = 3x^2\) is mistakenly applied as \(y = 6x\), can be considered relatively natural or attractive because it stems from a misunderstanding of algebraic expressions and functions, particularly the effect of exponents. A student might find this error appealing if they haven't fully grasped the concept of quadratic relationships versus linear ones. Realizing the mistake might depend on the student's background knowledge, feedback from teachers, or comparison with expected outcomes or graphs. Without graphical tools or instantaneous feedback, recognizing the error could be challenging, making it a common pitfall.

The best answer is C.
