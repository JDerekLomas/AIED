## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is confusing the operation to be performed when substituting a value into the equation \(y = 3x^2\). A common error is to assume the equation implies \(y = 3x\) instead of \(y = 3x^2\), or simply forgetting to square \(x\) properly and then multiplying by 3.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
If a student mistakenly thinks \(y = 3x\) instead of \(y = 3x^2\), they would substitute \(x = 0.3\) into what they believe is the correct equation. Here's the step-by-step process with the misconception:
1. The student sees \(x = 0.3\).
2. They apply what they think is the correct equation: \(y = 3 \times 0.3\).
3. Performing the multiplication: \(y = 0.9\).

However, another plausible misconception could be not squaring \(x\). Let's correct that and assume the actual mistake is interpreting \(3x^2\) as \(3x\):
1. \(y = 3 \times 0.3^2\)
But if squaring \(x\) but mistakenly thinking of \(0.3\) as \(.03\) or just miscalculating:
- Correct step: \(y = 3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09\).

## 3: Calculate the correct answer and identify which option the misconception leads to
Correct calculation:
\(y = 3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\).

If a student mistakenly calculates \(y = 3 \times 0.3\) (not squaring \(0.3\)):
- \(y = 3 \times 0.3 = 0.9\), which is not an option.

But a likely mistake could be:
- Calculating \(3 \times 0.3\) directly gives \(0.9\), which isn't listed. If instead they compute \(3^2 \times 0.3\) or \(0.3^2\) but add errors:
Given options are A: \(0.81\), B: \(0.27\), C: \(1.8\), D: \(2.7\);

For A (\(0.81\)):
Perhaps \(9 \times 0.3 \times 3 \) isn't done; \(y= 3 *.09= .27,  .09 * 9 = .81\) so 
Multiplying \(3 \times 7\) seems incorrect

If assuming multiplication wrongly such \(y= 0.3 *10 *0.3\) does lead astray 

Let's inspect
