## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply when multiplying out the brackets \((m-5)(m-7)\) is the incorrect application of the distributive property, specifically adding the constants inside the brackets instead of multiplying them and then combining like terms correctly. A common bug involves incorrect handling of the signs. Another common misconception is not properly applying the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) or mistakenly adding/subtracting terms.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
A student with a common misconception might proceed as follows:
- They might remember to multiply the first terms: \(m \times m = m^2\)
- Then multiply the outer terms: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
- Next, multiply the inner terms: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
- Finally, multiply the last terms: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)
- However, a buggy step could involve incorrectly combining these, such as \(-7m - 5m\) being added instead of combined properly with attention to signs, leading to a potential mistaken combination like: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35\)

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
Given the buggy procedure described, specifically if a student mistakenly combines the middle terms or mishandles signs, they might end up with:
\[m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\]
or
\[m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35\]
The description suggests an error leading directly to:
\[m^2 - 12m - 35\]

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
This error is quite natural and attractive because it involves a misunderstanding of how to distribute and combine like terms, which is a fundamental concept that students are still solidifying in Year 9. The mistake might seem plausible because:
- The student starts correctly with \(m^2\).
- They then subtract \(7m\) and \(5m\), mistakenly thinking to add \(-7m - 5m\) but misapplying signs which results in a seemingly legitimate calculation: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35\), turning into \(m^2 - 12m - 35\).
The plausibility and visual inspection (looking at \(-5\), \(-7\) and \(-35\)) could lead a student not to immediately notice their error without careful reconsideration of the algebraic process.

The best answer is D.
