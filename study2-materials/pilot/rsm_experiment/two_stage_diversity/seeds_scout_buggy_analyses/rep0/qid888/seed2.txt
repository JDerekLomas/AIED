## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply when multiplying out the brackets \((m-5)(m-7)\) is incorrectly adding the numbers within the brackets instead of multiplying them out correctly using the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last).

## 2: Describe the correct FOIL method
The correct FOIL method for \((m-5)(m-7)\) is:
- First: \(m \times m = m^2\)
- Outer: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
- Inner: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
- Last: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)
Then, combine like terms: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 3: Describe the buggy procedure
A student with the misconception might incorrectly apply a procedure such as:
\((m-5)(m-7) = m(m) - (5+7)\) which mistakenly simplifies to \(m^2 - 12\).

However, a more plausible bug for this context would involve incorrectly applying the distributive property or FOIL method, such as mistakenly adding the constants and then not properly distributing:
\(= m(m) + m(-7) -5(m) -5(-7)\)
But if they mistakenly add the -5 and -7 directly into the equation without properly multiplying, they'd might get:
\(= m^2 - 5m - 7m - 35\) but incorrectly calculate or represent the middle terms.

## 4: Work through the question step by step with the misconception
If a student mistakenly thinks to directly multiply and then add/subtract incorrectly (for example, not using FOIL properly but rather doing \(m^2 - (5+7)m + 35\)), they would get:
\(= m^2 - 12m + 35\), but if their actual mistake is more fundamental, such as \(m^2 - 5m - 7m - 35\) (correct middle term calculation but not correctly simplified answer choice given), it leads to:
\(= m^2 - 12m - 35\).

## 5: Identify which answer option the misconception leads to
The misconception described could lead a student to various incorrect paths, but most directly if they mistakenly add the numbers within the brackets as part of an incorrect shortcut or misunderstanding of how to expand:
The actual most likely error to result in one of the choices given would result in \(m^2 - 12m - 35\), matching option D.

## 6: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
The error that leads to \(m^2 - 12m - 35\) (D) seems quite plausible and natural. A common mistake is to forget to change the sign of one of the terms or miscalculate the signs during multiplication. This error is attractive because it results from a semi-plausible but flawed application of algebraic rules, and without careful checking, the student might not realize they've made a mistake.

The best answer is D.
