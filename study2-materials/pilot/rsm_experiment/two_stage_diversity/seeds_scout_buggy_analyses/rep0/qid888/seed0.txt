## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply when multiplying out the brackets \((m-5)(m-7)\) is the incorrect application of the distributive property or FOIL method, specifically adding the terms instead of multiplying and then combining like terms correctly. However, a common mistake is to add or subtract the terms incorrectly when applying the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last). A precise bug could be forgetting to change the signs correctly or mishandling the multiplication of negatives.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
A student might incorrectly apply the FOIL method as follows:
1. Multiply the First terms: \(m \times m = m^2\)
2. Multiply the Outer terms: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
3. Multiply the Inner terms: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
4. Multiply the Last terms: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)

Then, they might incorrectly combine these: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

However, another common error could involve incorrectly handling the signs, such as:
\((m - 5)(m - 7) = m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35\).

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
If a student incorrectly combines the terms by adding the \(m\) terms' coefficients instead of subtracting them or misinterprets the signs:
- The correct calculation is: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).
- This directly leads to answer option B: \(m^{2}-12 m+35\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves a straightforward but incorrect application of rules. Students often struggle with handling negative signs and combining like terms. In this case, simply misplacing or misinterpreting the signs or not properly applying the distributive property can lead to seemingly plausible answers. Without checking their work through substitution or expansion with specific values for \(m\), a student might not realize they went wrong.

The best answer is B.
