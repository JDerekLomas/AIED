## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or buggy procedure that a UK Year 9 student might apply when multiplying out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\) is incorrectly adding the numbers inside the brackets when applying the distributive property (also known as FOIL for binomials), but more precisely, it's mistakenly assuming that the signs within the brackets directly influence the operation (addition or subtraction) in a wrong way. A common error related to this is the incorrect application of signs or misremembering the FOIL method as simply multiplying the first terms, then the outer, then the inner, then the last, without properly handling the signs.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
Let's say the student mistakenly believes they should simply multiply the terms without correctly accounting for the signs or gets the operations mixed up. The correct FOIL method for \((m-5)(m-7)\) is:
1. Multiply the First terms: \(m \times m = m^2\)
2. Multiply the Outer terms: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
3. Multiply the Inner terms: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
4. Multiply the Last terms: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)

Then combine like terms: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

If a student incorrectly applies signs or misinterprets the operations, for example, thinking it should be \(m^2 + 12m + 35\) (which might come from incorrectly adding \(m^2\), wrongly combining \(-7m - 5m\) to get \(+12m\), and adding \(35\)), they would mistakenly calculate:
- \(m^2\) (correct),
- Outer and Inner terms incorrectly to get \(+12m\) (e.g., \(7m + 5m\)),
- And \(+35\).

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the common misconceptions, a student might end up with \(m^2 + 12m + 35\) (C) if they incorrectly add the middle terms and/or misinterpret the signs. This would indeed point to option C.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive, especially for students who are still solidifying their understanding of algebraic manipulations. The FOIL method, while straightforward, relies on correctly applying the operations and signs. Students might find it easy to misjudge the operations on the middle terms or misremember how to combine them. This kind of mistake can be particularly hard to notice for students because it doesn't always result in an obviously wrong numerical answer (though it's obviously wrong algebraically), and without checking their work through substitution or another method, they might not catch the error.

The best answer is B.
