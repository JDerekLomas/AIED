## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or buggy procedure that a UK Year 9 student might apply is the incorrect application of the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials), specifically adding the terms inside the brackets instead of multiplying them. However, a more common error in this context is likely to be a sign error when applying the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last), which could lead to incorrect addition or subtraction of the products.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
Let's say the student mistakenly applies a wrong sign when multiplying out the brackets using the FOIL method. The correct steps are: $(m-5)(m-7) = m(m) + m(-7) -5(m) -5(-7) = m^2 -7m -5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35$. If a student has a misconception, such as incorrectly handling the signs or the terms, they might do: $m^2 + (-7m) + (-5m) + (-35)$ (incorrectly keeping or changing signs inappropriately), $m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35$, and then still get $m^2 -12m -35$ because they correctly did the math but let's show another error: if the student incorrectly thinks to subtract both terms' products without accounting for the proper distribution and negations accurately but following through: The student correctly uses $m^2 - 7m - 5m +35 = m^2 -12m +35$, which means actually does not display mistake here directly through steps without misconception.


## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to
The step with a mistaken could go; step could look;  
$(mmm) – term term; \ m \ get. They write; They see, Students compute  see  
   Direct  gets   
 $ student computes. They (m -5)= do   
 term . When calculate m(m). student  subtract multiply . compute multiply add)7) = term compute do  $ $5)( term   product   = . $ comput 
so m  
5 get  
They: A common: to; m student ( in fact not add A) do not :


However actually 
the  result m^ – students; term they
 compute (   ( to m to A students A compute)

So actually B C A B

 So

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is — would the student even realise they went wrong?

 So
