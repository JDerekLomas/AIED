## Step 1: Understand the problems and the order of operations
The problems given are: Problem P: \( 4-5+6= \) and Problem Q: \( 4+5 \times 6= \). According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), in Problem P, operations should be performed from left to right since all operations are addition and subtraction, which have the same precedence. In Problem Q, multiplication should be performed before addition.

## 2: Identify the correct order of operations for each problem
For Problem P: The operations are performed from left to right, so \( 4-5 \) should be done first, then add 6. For Problem Q: Multiplication should be done before addition, so \( 5 \times 6 \) should be done first.

## 3: Specify the misconception or procedural error
A common misconception among students is not following the order of operations correctly, especially when it comes to addition and subtraction or when there are multiple operations with different precedences.

## 4: Describe a specific misconception
One specific misconception could be treating all operations as if they have the same precedence and performing them from left to right regardless of their type (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), or incorrectly applying the rules.

## 5: Apply the misconception to the problems
If a student mistakenly applies operations strictly from left to right without considering the precedence of operations (especially for multiplication and addition/subtraction), for Problem P, they might correctly or incorrectly think \( 4-5 \) then \( +6 \), but for Problem Q, they might incorrectly do \( 4+5 \) first.

## 6: Analyze the options based on the misconception
Given the options:
- A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \)
- B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \)
- C: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \)
- D: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \)

## 7: Determine which option reflects a common misconception
The misconception of doing operations strictly from left to right might lead a student to option C for Problem P (\( 5+6 \) first) and option A for Problem Q (\( 4+5 \) first), but this combination isn't listed. However, the notion that addition and subtraction are done before multiplication or vice versa isn't typically misapplied in simple contexts like these but can lead to confusion.

## 8: Identify the misconception explicitly
The misconception here could specifically be a failure to recognize that multiplication should come before addition but correctly performing left-to-right operations for addition/subtraction of equal precedence.

## 9: Choose the correct answer
The student with a misconception might think to add or subtract first regardless, leading to option A as an example of a misunderstanding - for P doing \( 4-5 \) first (which is actually correct), and for Q, adding \( 4+5 \) first (which is incorrect because multiplication precedes).

## 10: Describe the naturalness/attractiveness of the error
This error can be quite natural, especially if a student hasn't solidified the rules of BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) or PEMDAS. The student might not even realize they went wrong because they are simply performing operations in a seemingly logical order, not understanding the precedence rules.

The best answer is B.
