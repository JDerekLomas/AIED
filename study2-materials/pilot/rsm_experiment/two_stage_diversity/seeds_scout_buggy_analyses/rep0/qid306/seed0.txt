## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error in this context could be related to the order of operations, specifically a misunderstanding of BIDMAS/BODMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction), which is a mnemonic used in the UK to remember the order of operations.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step for both problems.
For Problem P: \( 4-5+6 \), a common misconception might involve ignoring the order of operations and simply performing the operations from left to right or misinterpreting the rules. A student might mistakenly calculate \( 4-5 \) first because it's on the left, then add 6.

For Problem Q: \( 4+5 \times 6 \), the student might ignore the multiplication and addition rules completely, thinking to do \( 4+5 \) first because both are on the left side.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
The misconception of performing operations from left to right without applying the BIDMAS/BODMAS rules could lead to the student choosing:
- For Problem P: \( 4-5 \) first (which seems logical but incorrect according to BIDMAS since there are no brackets or exponents and no division)
- For Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) first (incorrect because multiplication should come before addition according to BIDMAS)

This aligns with option A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \).

## 4: Assess how natural or attractive this error is and if the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is quite natural and attractive, especially for students who haven't fully grasped the BIDMAS/BODMAS rules or those who are used to calculator output where such rules might not strictly apply (as calculators follow BIDMAS but might not make the user aware of the steps). Students might not even realize they went wrong if they've developed a procedural habit of performing operations left to right without applying these rules.

The best answer is A.
