## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply involves misunderstanding the order of operations, specifically ignoring the rule that in the absence of brackets, multiplication and division should be performed before addition and subtraction (often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS: Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). A common buggy procedure is to perform operations from left to right without considering the precedence of operations.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through Problem P and Problem Q step by step.
For Problem P: \( 4-5+6= \), a student with the misconception might perform the operations from left to right:
1. \( 4 - 5 = -1 \)
2. Then, \( -1 + 6 = 5 \)
So, the student would get \( 5 \) as the answer, which is actually correct for Problem P but let's see how it applies to the question about which calculation to do first.

For Problem Q: \( 4+5 \times 6= \), using the same left-to-right approach without considering the precedence of operations:
1. \( 4 + 5 = 9 \)
2. Then, \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \)
The correct approach for Problem Q is to do the multiplication first: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \), then \( 4 + 30 = 34 \).

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
The misconception leads to performing operations in a left-to-right manner without regard to operator precedence. For Problem P, this means doing \( 4-5 \) first, and for Problem Q, it means doing \( 4+5 \) first. This matches option A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is quite natural and attractive because it simplifies the process to a straightforward left-to-right calculation, which can seem logical at first glance. Many students might not realize they've gone wrong unless they've been explicitly taught and have practiced the correct order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and can see the discrepancy in results or are prompted to check their work. The error doesn't necessarily lead to an obviously incorrect final answer in Problem P (though it does in Problem Q), which might make it less noticeable.

The best answer is A.
