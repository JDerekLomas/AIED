## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or buggy procedure that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this scenario is inverting the fraction incorrectly when solving for the variable or misunderstanding the division by a fraction. However, a common and precise bug in this context is the student treating multiplication and division by fractions similarly without changing the operation, specifically neglecting inverting and changing the operation sign correctly. For the equation \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \), a precise bug could be seen as incorrectly performing the operation with fractions or forgetting that to isolate \( \star \), one must multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \( -\frac{3}{4} \), which is \( -\frac{4}{3} \).

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question
If a student mistakenly thinks that to solve for \( \star \), they simply take the reciprocal of \( -\frac{3}{4} \) without considering the multiplication, they might directly substitute. However, a more likely and specific error for multiplication by a fraction involves directly dealing with multiplication:

Given equation: \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \)

Student mistakenly doing step without inverting and multiplying or directly incorrectly isolating \( \star \):

To isolate \( \star \), a student correctly would:
\[ \stern = -1 \div \left(-\frac{3}{4}\right) \]
\[ \star = -1 \times \left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) \]
\[ \star = \frac{4}{3} \]

However, if misconceived (for example simply taking \( \star = \frac{-1}{(-\frac{3}{4})} \) which equals:
\[ \star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} \]
\[ \star = \frac{4}{3} \]
Actually demonstrating direct division might reveal more standard inverse operation thinking not misplaced inversions specifically leading us to

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
Based on incorrect division step to get
\[ -\frac{3}{4} \div -\frac{3}{4} \star \text{ is 'how the inverse incorrectly yields'} \]
Student should:
\( \frac{-1 }{-\frac{3}{4} }\) or 

Using proper procedure \(-\1 \) x \( - (\frac {4}{3}) =\frac {4}{5}\text isn't directly computed } actually yields \) A The  correct Step) leads towards '
