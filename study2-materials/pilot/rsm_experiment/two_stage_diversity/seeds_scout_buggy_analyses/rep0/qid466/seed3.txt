## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply is reversing the operation when solving for the variable. In equations involving multiplication and division, students sometimes mistakenly think that to isolate the variable, they should perform the inverse operation on both sides but end up applying it incorrectly. A common bug is not changing the sign or not properly handling negative numbers in multiplication and division.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
Given the equation \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \), a student with the misconception might reason as follows:

1. To isolate \(\star\), they need to get rid of \(-\frac{3}{4}\). They know the inverse operation of multiplication is division. So, they think: "\(\star = -1 \div -\frac{3}{4}\)".

2. The student then proceeds to divide \(-1\) by \(-\frac{3}{4}\), which can be rewritten as multiplying \(-1\) by the reciprocal of \(-\frac{3}{4}\), i.e., \(-\frac{4}{3}\). However, if the student's misconception involves mishandling the negative sign or fraction, they might directly calculate \(-1 \div -\frac{3}{4}\) as \(\frac{-1}{-\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{4}{3}\).

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Based on the incorrect steps described, if the student incorrectly calculates or simply applies the wrong operation/rules for negative numbers and fractions:

\(\star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\)

This leads to answer option A: \( \frac{4}{3} \).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is quite natural and attractive because it involves a common misconception about handling negative signs and fractional operations. Many students struggle with the concept of dividing by a fraction, which is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. Additionally, managing negative numbers in these operations can be tricky. A student might not realize they went wrong because:

- The steps seem logical (dividing by a fraction is involved).
- The mistake doesn't necessarily involve a calculation error but a conceptual misunderstanding.
- Without checking their work or having a solid understanding of fractional operations and negative number rules, they might not catch the mistake.

The best answer is A.
