## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in solving the equation \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \) is incorrectly handling the negative sign when solving for the star (\( \star \)). A common error could be mistakenly changing the sign of one of the numbers or not properly inverting when dividing by a fraction.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
Let's consider a student who incorrectly thinks that to solve for \( \star \), they simply need to divide -1 by \( -\frac{3}{4} \) but mishandles the signs or the division by a fraction: 

\( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \)

The student might incorrectly reason:
- To isolate \( \star \), divide both sides by \( -\frac{3}{4} \), which they might see as multiplying by \( -\frac{4}{3} \) but gets confused with the signs.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
If a student divides -1 by \( -\frac{3}{4} \) directly without appropriately inverting and changing signs:
\( \star = -1 \div \left(-\frac{3}{4}\right) \)

This can be rewritten as:
\( \star = -1 \times \left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) \)  # The misconception here might involve not changing the sign properly or not inverting the fraction correctly.

\( \star = \frac{4}{3} \)

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
The error of simply multiplying by the reciprocal without handling the negative signs properly is quite natural and attractive because it stems from a well-intentioned application of rules (dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal) but mishandled. Students might not realize they went wrong, especially if they are not paying close attention to the signs or if they are under time pressure.

The best answer is A.
