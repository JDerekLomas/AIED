## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply is adding the whole numbers and then adding the fractions without finding a common denominator, but more specifically, incorrectly handling the addition of mixed numbers by not converting them into improper fractions or finding a common denominator for the fractional parts.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
To work through \( 2 \frac{7}{10}+2 \frac{1}{4} \), a student with this misconception might:
1. Add the whole numbers: \(2 + 2 = 4\)
2. Add the fractions directly: \( \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} \)
3. Since they don't find a common denominator, they might simply add the numerators and denominators: \( \frac{7+1}{10+4} = \frac{8}{14} \)
4. Combine the results: \( 4 + \frac{8}{14} = 4 \frac{8}{14} \)

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
This misconception directly leads to answer option D: \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
This error can seem natural or attractive to students because it simplifies the process by avoiding the need to find a common denominator for the fractions. Students might not realize they've gone wrong because their method seems straightforward and they've managed to produce an answer in the required mixed number format. However, the error lies in the incorrect handling of fraction addition. The result \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \) can be simplified or expressed differently, but the direct addition of fractions without a common denominator is a common and intuitive mistake.

The best answer is D.
