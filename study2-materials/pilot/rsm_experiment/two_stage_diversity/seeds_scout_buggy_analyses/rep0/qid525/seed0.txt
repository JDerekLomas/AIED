## Step 1: Identifying the Misconception
The specific misconception or buggy procedure that a UK Year 9 student might apply is adding the whole numbers and then adding the fractions separately without finding a common denominator for the fractions. This can be termed as "inappropriate splitting of mixed numbers" or more specifically, "failure to find a common denominator when adding fractions."

## 2: Working Through the Question with the Misconception
To work through \( 2 \frac{7}{10}+2 \frac{1}{4} \) with this misconception:

1. Add the whole numbers: \(2 + 2 = 4\)
2. Add the fractions: \(\frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4}\)
3. Without finding a common denominator, some students might incorrectly add these as \(\frac{7+1}{10+4} = \frac{8}{14}\)
4. Combine the results: \(4 + \frac{8}{14}\)

## 3: Identifying the Answer Option
This misconception leads to \(4 \frac{8}{14}\), which can also be written as \(4 \frac{4}{7}\) if simplified, but in its current form directly matches one of the provided options.

## 4: Evaluating the Attractiveness of the Error
The error might seem natural or attractive to students who are not fully comfortable with adding fractions and mixed numbers. The mistake of adding the denominators (\(\frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{8}{14}\)) can appear reasonable at first glance because it involves basic addition operations. However, recognizing that \(\frac{8}{14}\) can be simplified to \(\frac{4}{7}\), which doesn't directly match any step usually taken in these problems, might not immediately reveal the error without checking against a correct method, such as finding a common denominator (20) and then adding: \(\frac{7}{10} = \frac{14}{20}\) and \(\frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{20}\), which results in \(\frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20}\). Adding this to the 4 gives \(4 \frac{19}{20}\), a correct answer provided.

The best answer is D.
