## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or buggy procedure that a UK Year 9 student might apply is adding the whole numbers and then adding the fractions without finding a common denominator for the fractions, but incorrectly handling the fractions by either not converting them to improper fractions properly or not finding a common denominator.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student might start by adding the whole numbers: \(2 + 2 = 4\). Then, they might add the fractions \(\frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4}\) without finding a common denominator. If the student does not realize the need for a common denominator, they might simply add the numerators and the denominators: \(\frac{7+1}{10+4} = \frac{8}{14}\). The student then combines the whole number part with the fraction part: \(4 + \frac{8}{14}\). This can be simplified or left as is.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
This misconception leads to the answer \(4 \frac{8}{14}\). We need to check if any of the given options match this result. Option D is \(4 \frac{8}{14}\), which directly matches the result of this erroneous procedure.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is quite natural and attractive because it seems logical to add the parts of the mixed numbers separately. Many students might not immediately realize they went wrong because they followed a seemingly straightforward procedure. The error lies in not converting the fractions to have a common denominator before adding them, which is a critical step often overlooked by students who are not yet fluent in handling fractions.

The best answer is D.
