## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is reversing the roles of $x$ and $y$ in the equation or incorrectly substituting values into the equation $4x + 2y = 10$. However, a common and more pronounced misconception could be misunderstanding how to solve for one variable when the other is given or assuming a linear relationship implies a simple ratio between $x$ and $y$ without properly substituting. But more precisely, let's consider a student might incorrectly think to solve for $y$ by simply rearranging the formula in a way that does not account for the coefficients properly or by mistakenly trying to isolate $y$ without adhering to algebraic rules.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
Let's say a student incorrectly assumes that to find $y$ when $x=0$, they simply rearrange the equation as $y = 10 - 4x$ without considering the coefficients properly, which actually should be $2y = 10 - 4x$ and then $y = (10 - 4x)/2$. 

So, for $x=0$:
- Correct step: $4(0) + 2y = 10 \Rightarrow 2y = 10 \Rightarrow y = 5$.
- Misconception step (e.g., if the student thought $y = 10 - 4x$ directly): $y = 10 - 4(0) = 10$.

However, let's consider a more fitting example of misconception: If a student thought that $x$ and $y$ contribute equally to the equation or made a similar mistake, they might mistakenly think $y$ could be found by equating $x$ and $y$'s coefficients directly or simple proportion. 

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
If a student mistakenly uses $y = 10 - 4x$ (ignorning the $2y$ and directly substituting):
For $x = 0$, $y = 10 - 4(0) = 10$; but considering $2y$ should be accounted for properly, let's assess given options with correct calculation:
Given $4x + 2y = 10$, when $x=0$, 
$4(0) + 2y = 10$, 
$2y = 10$, 
$y = 5$.

This matches option C.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
This error could seem natural if the student hasn't fully grasped how to substitute into equations with multiple variables and solve for one variable. They might not realize their mistake if they do not take the time to check their work or substitute their $y$ value back into the equation to verify. The equation seems straightforward, but forgetting to divide by 2 (the coefficient of $y$) when solving for $y$ could easily happen to a student still grappling with algebra.

The best answer is C.
