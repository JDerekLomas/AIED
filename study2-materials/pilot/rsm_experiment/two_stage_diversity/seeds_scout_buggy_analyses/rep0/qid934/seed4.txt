## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is confusing the operations or misinterpreting the equation. A common error could be incorrectly rearranging the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) or substituting values improperly.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
Let's assume the misconception involves solving for \(y\) but getting the algebraic manipulation wrong. The correct step to find \(y\) when \(x = 0\) is:
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[0 + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]
\[y = 5\]
However, a student with a misconception might proceed as follows, for example, by trying to solve for \(y\) without properly isolating it or by mistakenly applying operations:
- They might see the equation and think to subtract \(4x\) from both sides correctly but then not divide by 2 properly for \(y\), or they might incorrectly try to solve it by mistakenly thinking \(y = 10 - 4x\), ignoring the coefficient of \(y\).

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
If a student mistakenly thinks \(y = 10 - 4x\) (which would be a misunderstanding of the equation's structure), substituting \(x = 0\) yields:
\[y = 10 - 4(0) = 10\]
But let's correct that with a plausible mistake specifically for \(4x + 2y = 10\), if someone thought \(2y = 10 - 4x\) but then incorrectly divided or handled the equation:
The actual mistake could be in not dividing by 2, so if \(x = 0\):
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]
They might mistakenly not solve for \(y\) correctly or overlook division by 2, not realizing \(y = 5\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and if the student would realize they went wrong.
A natural error in algebra for students might involve misplacing coefficients or incorrectly applying operations. For instance, directly substituting without solving for \(y\) or mistakenly using \(y = (10 - 4x)\) without the division by 2 for \(y\)'s coefficient could lead to \(y = 10\) for \(x = 0\), suggesting an answer of \(20\) if there was a doubling error in calculation or an assumption about \(y\)'s value based on mistaken algebraic handling.

The best answer is C.
