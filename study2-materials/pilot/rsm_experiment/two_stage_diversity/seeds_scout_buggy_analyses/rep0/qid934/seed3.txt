## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is reversing the order of operations or misinterpreting the equation $4x + 2y = 10$ by possibly trying to solve for $y$ without properly rearranging the equation or substituting $x=0$ directly into the equation to find $y$. However, a more likely and specific bug could be treating the equation as if $y$ is independent of $x$ or simply not substituting $x=0$ into the equation correctly.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
A student with the misconception might directly try to solve the equation for $y$ when $x=0$ without actually performing the substitution. For instance, if the student's misconception involves incorrectly assuming $y$ can be found through a simpler method (like just using $y = 10/2 = 5$ when $x=0$, ignoring $4x$), they might:
1. Look at the equation $4x + 2y = 10$.
2. Think, "When $x=0$, $4x = 0$, so $2y = 10$".
3. Solve $2y = 10$ to get $y = 5$.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
Given the incorrect but straightforward calculation from Step 2:
- When $x = 0$, the student finds $y = 5$.
This calculation aligns with answer option C.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it's based on a partial understanding of how to solve equations. Many students at this level are still solidifying their understanding of algebra and may overlook the need to systematically substitute values into equations. The mistake of overlooking $4x$ when $x=0$ (since $4*0=0$) might not seem like an error to the student because $4x$ does indeed equal $0$ when $x=0$, making the calculation $2y=10$ seem valid. Therefore, the student might not realize they went wrong because their calculation logically follows from a casual reading of the equation, especially if they are not methodically substituting $x=0$ into the full equation.

The best answer is C.
