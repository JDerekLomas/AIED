## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is the incorrect handling of the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) when substituting \(x = 0\). A common error could be forgetting to isolate \(y\) properly or mishandling the equation's transformation.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step
A student with the misconception might proceed as follows:
- Start with the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\).
- When \(x = 0\), substitute into the equation: \(4(0) + 2y = 10\).
- This simplifies to \(2y = 10\).
- A common error could involve dividing both sides by 2 to solve for \(y\): \(y = 10 / 2 = 5\).
However, let's examine if there's a more specific error related to common misconceptions in algebra, such as confusion with operations or signs.

## 3: Identify the misconception leading to an answer option
Upon re-examination, a plausible misconception could involve solving for \(y\) when \(x=0\) but misinterpreting the process:
- Given \(4x + 2y = 10\), when \(x = 0\), we get \(2y = 10\), which leads to \(y = 5\). This actually seems correct, not an error. Let's consider another possible mistake: if a student incorrectly applies the formula or skips steps, they might end up with one of the provided incorrect answers.

## 4: Analyze the provided options to match a possible misconception
If a student mistakenly uses \(4x = 10\) when \(x = 0\), they'd get \(0 = 10\), which doesn't make sense. However, if they incorrectly solve for \(y\) without properly substituting \(x = 0\) or misread the equation:
- For \(x = 0\), \(4(0) + 2y = 10\) translates to \(2y = 10\), thus \(y = 5\), which matches option C.

## 5: Detail the specific misconception and its consequence
The exact misconception here seems tricky since direct substitution and solving yields \(y = 5\) correctly. A possible mistake could be in calculating or substituting, for instance, subtracting \(4x\) from both sides without applying it: if one forgets \(x=0\), \(4*0+2y=10\) becomes \(2y=10\) correctly. A bogus step might involve incorrect coefficient handling or assuming \(y\) can be found without fully solving, but it seems C is directly derived from proper algebra.

## 6: Assessing naturalness and attractiveness of the error
The mistake isn't very attractive or natural given conventional algebraic manipulation teaches correct steps: substitute \(x\), solve for \(y\). If one misinterpreted or skipped the operation \(4*0\), still, the resulting algebra guides to \(y=5\). Not many procedural errors produce A, B, or D given the equation's direct solvability.

The best answer is C.
