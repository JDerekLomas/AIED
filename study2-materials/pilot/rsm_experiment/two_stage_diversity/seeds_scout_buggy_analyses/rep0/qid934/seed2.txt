## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) but then incorrectly solving for \(y\). A common error could be not isolating \(y\) correctly or misinterpreting the equation. However, a precise bug could be "reversing the coefficient relationship" or simply not following algebraic procedures correctly, such as forgetting to divide by 2 when solving for \(y\). A more specific bug could be: incorrectly assuming \(x\) and \(y\) can be directly substituted without properly rearranging the formula or not applying inverse operations correctly.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
A student might start with the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\). When \(x = 0\), they substitute it into the equation to get \(4(0) + 2y = 10\), simplifying to \(2y = 10\), which leads to \(y = 5\). This step seems correct and does not directly indicate a misconception. However, if the student's misconception involves not checking their work or assuming they can guess or that there's an obvious simple number, they might stop here and think \(y = 5\) is the answer due to not verifying if this actually matches an provided option or simply calculates it directly.

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the correct calculation: when \(x = 0\), \(4(0) + 2y = 10\), which simplifies to \(2y = 10\) and thus \(y = 5\). This matches option C.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and if the student would realize they went wrong.
The error of getting \(y = 5\) seems natural and attractive because it directly results from a standard algebraic manipulation. If done carelessly or without verifying the steps against known procedures, a student might not realize they've gone wrong because their algebraic steps are formally correct given the straightforward nature of the substitution and solving for \(y\). This means the student is unlikely to realize their mistake if they were to mistakenly calculate or if expecting an error in more complex manipulation.

The best answer is C.
