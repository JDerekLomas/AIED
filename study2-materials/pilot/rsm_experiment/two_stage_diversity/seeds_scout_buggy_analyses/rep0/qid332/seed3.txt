## Step 1: Understand the given problem and the students' responses.
The equation given is \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \). Tom suggests the next line of working could be \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \), and Katie suggests \( x - 5 = 36 \).

## 2: Evaluate Tom's suggestion.
To solve \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \), adding 5 to both sides gives \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \), which matches Tom's suggestion. This is a correct algebraic manipulation.

## 3: Evaluate Katie's suggestion.
Katie's suggestion is \( x - 5 = 36 \). To see if this is a correct step from the original equation, we would multiply every term in the original equation by 3 to clear the denominator: \( x - 15 = 36 \). Katie's \( x - 5 = 36 \) does not correctly derive from the original equation; it seems she mistakenly multiplied the constant term -5 by 3 as if it were part of the fraction, resulting in \( -5 \) being incorrectly treated.

## 4: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception here appears to involve incorrectly applying operations to solve equations, particularly in Katie's case, where it seems she misunderstands how to isolate \( x \) by applying operations uniformly across the equation.

## 5: Analyze Katie's procedural error precisely.
Katie's error seems to stem from incorrectly multiplying the entire equation by 3. The correct step would yield \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \). This indicates Katie might be misapplying the multiplication property of equality or misunderstands the distribution of operations in equations.

## 6: Determine which student is correct based on standard algebraic procedures.
Tom is correct because adding 5 to both sides of \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) indeed yields \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). Katie's suggestion, \( x - 5 = 36 \), does not follow from the original equation through standard algebraic manipulations.

## 7: Describe the misconception or buggy procedure.
The misconception here, specifically for Katie, could be described as a failure to properly apply algebraic operations to all parts of an equation when transforming it, suggesting an issue with understanding the properties of equality.

## 8: Assess the naturalness or attractiveness of the error.
Katie's error might seem natural or attractive to some students because it involves a straightforward but incorrect multiplication across the equation without properly accounting for each term's transformation.

## 9: Conclusion on who is correct and why.
Tom is correct; Katie is not. Thus, only Tom provides a correct next line of working.

## 10: Answer selection based on the analysis.
Given Tom is correct and Katie is not based on standard algebraic manipulations, the correct answer is A) Only Tom.

The best answer is A.
