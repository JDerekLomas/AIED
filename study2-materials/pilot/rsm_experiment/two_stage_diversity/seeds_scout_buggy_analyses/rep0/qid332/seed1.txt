## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error here involves understanding how to isolate a variable in an equation. Tom's suggestion, \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \), directly adds 5 to both sides of the equation \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \), which is a correct algebraic procedure. Katie's suggestion, \( x - 5 = 36 \), involves multiplying every term in the original equation by 3, which is also a valid algebraic step but let's analyze if it directly applies.

## 2: Analyze Katie's procedure step by step
To see if Katie's procedure is correct, let's apply it:
Original equation: \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \)
Multiplying every term by 3: \( x - 15 = 36 \)
Adding 15 to both sides: \( x = 51 \)

However, Katie's proposed step is \( x - 5 = 36 \), which suggests she multiplied both sides of the equation by 3 but didn't correctly adjust the -5 term. The correct multiplication by 3 should yield \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \).

## 3: Identify Tom's and Katie's correctness
Tom is correct because adding 5 to both sides of \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) yields \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \), which is a standard algebraic procedure.

Katie is incorrect because her proposed step, \( x - 5 = 36 \), does not correctly follow from multiplying the entire original equation by 3. The correct step after multiplying by 3 would indeed consider \( x/3 * 3 - 5*3 = 12*3 \), leading to \( x - 15 = 36 \), making her line \( x - 5 = 36 \) incorrect.

## 4: Describe the misconception and its attractiveness
The misconception Katie exhibits seems to involve misapplying algebraic operations to equations, specifically not accurately applying multiplication across all terms. This could stem from a lack of understanding or a procedural mistake where the student forgets to distribute the multiplication operation correctly across all terms.

This error might be fairly natural/attractive for a student to make because it involves a common operation (multiplying by a constant to clear a fraction) but requires careful application. A student might not realize they went wrong if they are not checking their work against known algebraic rules or if they don't verify their solution.

## 5: Determine the answer option
Given that Tom's suggestion is correct and Katie's is not, the correct answer is:
A) Only Tom.

## 6: Conclusion on misconception, procedure, and error attractiveness
1. The specific misconception: Misapplication of algebraic operations, specifically incorrect distribution of multiplication across terms in an equation.
2. A student with this misconception: Would likely attempt to solve equations by applying operations to some but not all terms, leading to incorrect steps like Katie's.
3. Leads to answer option A.
4. The error is somewhat attractive/natural as it comes from a reasonable but misapplied algebraic strategy.

The best answer is A.
