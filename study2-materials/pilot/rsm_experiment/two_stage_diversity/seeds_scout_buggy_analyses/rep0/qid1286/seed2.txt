## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in solving this problem is incorrectly rearranging the formula for the volume of a sphere, \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \), to solve for \( r \). A common mistake involves mishandling the steps to isolate \( r \), particularly when dealing with the constants and the exponent.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
The formula for the volume of a sphere is \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \). To find \( r \), a student should:
1. Start with \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \)
2. Multiply both sides by \( \frac{3}{4} \) to get \( \frac{3V}{4} = \pi r^3 \)
3. Divide both sides by \( \pi \) to get \( \frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3 \)
4. Take the cube root of both sides to get \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}} \)

However, a student with a misconception might incorrectly handle the division and multiplication steps or mishandle the algebra. For example, they might try to "get rid" of \( \pi \) by multiplying both sides by \( \pi \) instead of dividing, leading to an incorrect formula.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
If a student incorrectly applies the steps or forgets to properly distribute or cancel terms, they might end up with an incorrect expression. A plausible mistake could involve misapplying the operations to get \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}} \) or incorrectly separating the terms.

## 4: Analyze the naturalness/attractiveness of the error and the likelihood of the student realizing they went wrong
The misconception leading to option B, \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \), is quite natural because it stems from a likely misstep in algebraic manipulation. A student might mistakenly think to isolate \( r \) by simply moving terms around without properly accounting for the multiplication and division by the constants \( \frac{4}{3} \) and \( \pi \). This type of mistake can be attractive because it looks similar to a correct manipulation but skips the crucial step of properly inverting operations.

Given \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \), solving for \( r \) involves:
- \( r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi} \)
- Thus, \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}} \), which matches option C.

Option B, \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \), comes from incorrectly reversing the operations:
- Starting with \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \)
- A misguided step might try to solve it as \( r^3 = \frac{4V}{3\pi} \), leading to \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}} \).

The best answer is C.
