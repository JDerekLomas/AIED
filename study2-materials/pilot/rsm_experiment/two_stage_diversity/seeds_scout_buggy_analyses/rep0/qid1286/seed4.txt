## Step 1: Identify the correct formula for the volume of a sphere
The correct formula for the volume of a sphere is \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \), where \( V \) is the volume and \( r \) is the radius.

## 2: Solve the correct formula for \( r \) to find the radius
To find \( r \), we rearrange the formula: \( r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi} \), and then take the cube root of both sides to get \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}} \).

## 3: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
A common misconception or procedural error involves incorrectly rearranging the formula or misapplying the operations. Specifically, a student might mistakenly try to isolate \( r \) by incorrectly handling the constants or the powers.

## 4: Describe a specific misconception - confusion with the position of \( \pi \) and the coefficients
One specific misconception could involve confusing the position of \( \pi \) or the coefficients (like 4 and 3) when solving for \( r \). For example, a student might incorrectly derive the formula for \( r \) as \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}} \) or \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4V\pi}{3}} \) by mistakenly not inverting the operations properly.

## 5: Explain how a student with this misconception would work through the question
If a student mistakenly thinks \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \) should be rearranged by first multiplying both sides by \( \frac{3}{4\pi} \) to get \( r^3 = \frac{4V}{3\pi} \), they would then take the cube root to find \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}} \).

## 6: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to
This incorrect rearrangement leads to option A: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \) is not derived from the described mistake, but \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \) is, which corresponds to option B.

## 7: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves a plausible mistake in algebraic manipulation. Students might easily confuse the steps of solving for \( r \) and end up with an incorrect but seemingly reasonable formula. It might not be immediately obvious to the student that their solution is incorrect without further checking against the original formula or testing with known values.

The best answer is B.
