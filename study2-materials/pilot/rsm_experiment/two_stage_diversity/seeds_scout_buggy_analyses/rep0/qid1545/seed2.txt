## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is the incorrect application of the order of operations, specifically mistakenly applying addition before division, or not following the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with the misconception might evaluate the expressions as follows:
- For $8+12 \div 4$, they might incorrectly do $8 + 12 = 20$ first, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.
- For $(8+12) \div 4$, they might correctly do $(8+12) = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.
However, the more common misconception specifically for the left side would be adding first: $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
If a student incorrectly calculates $8+12 \div 4$ as $20 \div 4 = 5$ (which is actually the correct calculation if done properly with the correct order of operations: $12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8 + 3 = 11$), and correctly calculates $(8+12) \div 4$ as $20 \div 4 = 5$, they might think both equal 5, suggesting an equals sign. However, the actual mistake often seen is not recognizing the correct order of operations on the left side.

## 4: Evaluate how natural/attractive this error is.
The error of not following the correct order of operations (BODMAS) is very common and natural, especially when students are not thoroughly practiced in applying it. The student's tendency might be to perform operations from left to right without considering the hierarchy of operations, which makes this mistake quite attractive and not necessarily obvious as an error without feedback or checking against the correct procedure.

## 5: Determine the correct calculations.
The correct calculations are:
- $8 + 12 \div 4 = 8 + 3 = 11$
- $(8+12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$

## 6: Compare the calculations to the given options.
Since $11 > 5$, the correct comparison is $>$.

## 7: Relate back to the misconception.
If a student thinks both expressions equal 5 due to misapplication of order of operations, they would mistakenly choose $C) =$.

The best answer is A.
