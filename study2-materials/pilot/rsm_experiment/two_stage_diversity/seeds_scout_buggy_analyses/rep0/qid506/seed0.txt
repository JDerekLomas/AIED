## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in solving the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) is incorrectly handling the division by 3 or misinterpreting the operation needed to isolate \(p\). A common error is to incorrectly multiply or divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \(p\) (in this case, 3) or to mistakenly square or take the square root of both sides when trying to isolate the variable. However, a more straightforward misconception here could be failing to properly divide both sides by 3.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with the misconception that they need to multiply both sides by 3 (perhaps due to wanting to "get rid" of the 3) or simply not performing the division correctly might do the following:
- Start with \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\)
- A buggy step could involve incorrectly trying to isolate \(p\) by a mistaken operation such as: \(p = 3 \times \frac{1}{12}\), which simplifies to \(p = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\).

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the buggy step described, the student would arrive at \(p = \frac{1}{4}\), which corresponds to answer option A.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because students might mistakenly think that to get \(p\) by itself, they need to perform an operation that directly counters the coefficient (in a misguided attempt to "undo" multiplication by 3). The error lies in not dividing by 3 but rather multiplying by 3. Students may not realize they went wrong if they don't check their solution by substitution back into the original equation. For example, substituting \(p = \frac{1}{4}\) into \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) yields \(3(\frac{1}{4}) = \frac{3}{4}\), which does not equal \(\frac{1}{12}\), indicating an error. However, without this check, the mistake might go unnoticed.

The best answer is A.
