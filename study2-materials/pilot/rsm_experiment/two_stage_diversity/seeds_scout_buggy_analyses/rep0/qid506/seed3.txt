## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in solving the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) is incorrectly multiplying both sides by 3 to solve for \(p\), rather than dividing both sides by 3. This error stems from a misunderstanding of how to isolate the variable \(p\). The correct operation to isolate \(p\) would be to divide both sides by 3.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
If a student mistakenly decides to multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \(p\), their steps would look like this:
1. Start with the given equation: \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\)
2. Multiply both sides by 3 to try to solve for \(p\): \(3p \times 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times 3\)
3. This results in: \(9p = \frac{3}{12}\)
4. Simplify \(\frac{3}{12}\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\): \(9p = \frac{1}{4}\)
5. Finally, divide both sides by 9 to solve for \(p\): \(p = \frac{1}{4} \div 9 = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{36}\)

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the steps described, the student would arrive at \(p = \frac{1}{36}\). This corresponds to answer option B.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error might seem natural or attractive because it involves a common operation (multiplication) that students are comfortable with, and there might be confusion about how to "get rid" of the coefficient of \(p\). However, a student who follows the standard algebraic procedures for solving equations should realize that multiplying by 3 here would actually make \(p\) larger rather than solving for it directly. The mistake lies in not recognizing that to isolate \(p\), one must divide by 3: \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\). This misstep could easily go unnoticed if the student is not checking their work with substitution back into the original equation.

The best answer is B.
