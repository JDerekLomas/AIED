## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply is the incorrect application of the order of operations, specifically ignoring the order of multiplication before addition and subtraction. This is often referred to as not following BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction) or PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction) rules.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with this misconception might work through the question as follows:
1. Start with the first operation from left to right: \(3 - 5 = -2\)
2. Then, perform the next operation: \(-2 + 4 = 2\)
3. Finally, multiply by 2: \(2 \times 2 = 4\)

However, the accurate step-by-step following BIDMAS/PEMDAS would be:
1. Multiply 4 by 2: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Then, subtract 5 from 3: \(3 - 5 = -2\)
3. Finally, add 8 to -2: \(-2 + 8 = 6\)

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
The student's misconception leads to the calculation: \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 = -2 + 2 \times 4 = -2 + 8 = 6\), but incorrectly simplified. Let's correct that based on the described mistake:
The actual incorrect calculation based on the mistake described would directly lead to \(4\), as per the mistaken steps: \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \( -2 + 4 = 2\), and \(2 \times 2 = 4\). So, the answer option this misconception leads to is B) \(4\).

## 4: Evaluate how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is quite natural and attractive because it involves a common misunderstanding of mathematical operations' precedence. Students might not realize they went wrong if they are not explicitly taught or reminded of the BIDMAS/PEMDAS rules frequently, or if they do not receive feedback on their calculations that points out the specific mistake. The error seems reasonable at first glance because it follows a left-to-right approach that seems intuitive but is actually incorrect according to mathematical conventions.

The best answer is B.
