The question involves evaluating the expression $3-5+4 \times 2$. For this, I identified a common misconception or procedural error students in the UK might do.

## Step 1: Identifying the Specific Misconception or Procedural Error
The specific misconception or bug I am focusing on is: treating addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations as if they occur sequentially but without adhering to the strict order prescribed by BODMAS/BPEMDAS (Brackets, Orders/Index/Exponents, Division and Multiplication from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right). One prevalent misstep could involve 'evaluating from right to left' or otherwise mishandling the operations sequence rules rather than directly. A closer common example would be actually evaluating operations not in line because not knowing/ remembering BODMAS.

## 2: Describing the Incorrect Procedure Step by Step
A student adhering to the misconception might simplify the expression from left to right, skipping BODMAS, for example working from right to left which could make sense superficially:

1. Take the expression: $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 $
2. Start from the left or right mistakenly ignoring exponents/orders which not relevant. Start calculations linearly - First multiplication step or wrong ordering.

Sequential (ignoring bod) then 

    = They Start
        $3−(5+8)... if $

Incorrect sequential handling:

Actually lets say 

=   $ 4*2    =    8$
     
then  ( mis )
 
$-2 or     5    ) + = $
Or mistaken as
 $ -10    no. 
Or they do left 
= So get; $ 

$-1  =   $-2 then $
 
Or incorrectly put $+ then$ sub
