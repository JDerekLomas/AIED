## Step 1: Identifying the Misconception
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply is the incorrect application of the order of operations, specifically failing to follow the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule which stands for Brackets, Indices or Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. A common mistake is to perform operations from left to right without considering the hierarchy of operations.

## 2: Working Through the Question with the Misconception
A student with this misconception might work through the question as follows:
1. Start with the first operation from the left: \(3 - 5\)
2. Perform the subtraction: \(3 - 5 = -2\)
3. Then, perform the multiplication: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
4. Finally, add the result of the multiplication to the result of the subtraction: \(-2 + 8 = 6\)

## 3: Identifying the Incorrect Answer Option
Following this incorrect procedure leads to the answer:
\[3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 = 6\]
So, this misconception leads to answer option A: \(6\).

## 4: Assessing the Naturalness of the Error
This error is quite natural and attractive because it involves following a seemingly logical left-to-right approach without fully understanding or applying the rules of mathematical operations. Many students might not even realize they went wrong because the steps seem straightforward and logical. It requires a conscious effort to remember and apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly, especially under timed conditions or when under stress. The correct procedure, following BIDMAS/BODMAS, would be:
1. Multiplication: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Then, subtraction and addition from left to right: \(3 - 5 + 8 = 6\)
Interestingly, even with the correct application, the same numerical answer is reached, suggesting that the initial assessment of the error might have been misplaced in terms of identifying a mistaken calculation leading to an incorrect choice among A, B, C, or D.

## 5: Re-evaluation
Given the initial misinterpretation, let's correct and refine:
The correct steps following BIDMAS/BODMAS are:
1. \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. \(3 - 5 = -2\)
3. \(-2 + 8 = 6\)

This actually confirms that the mistaken approach still yields \(6\), but let's find a common error:
A common mistake could be not applying BIDMAS correctly, e.g., doing \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\) then \(2 \times 2 = 4\).

## 6: Example of Incorrect Application
An incorrect application could be:
\(3 - 5 = -2\),
\(-2 + 4 = 2\),
\(2 \times 2 = 4\).

This mistake leads to:
The best answer is B.
