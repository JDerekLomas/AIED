## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply involves misunderstanding the order of operations or incorrectly rearranging the equation \(10x - 6y = 30\) when solving for \(x\). A common error is to forget to isolate \(x\) properly or to incorrectly substitute given values.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
Given the equation \(10x - 6y = 30\) and the table with \(y = 0.5\), a student might start by substituting \(y = 0.5\) into the equation:
\[10x - 6(0.5) = 30\]
Then, they calculate:
\[10x - 3 = 30\]
Next, they add 3 to both sides:
\[10x = 33\]
Finally, they divide by 10:
\[x = 3.3\]

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to
This step-by-step process leads the student to conclude that \(x = 3.3\), which corresponds to answer option C.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong
This error is quite natural and attractive because it involves a straightforward, though incorrect, application of algebraic manipulations. The student might not even realize they went wrong because their steps seem logically consistent and they might not check their work or substitute back into the original equation to verify their solution. This kind of error can be tempting because it doesn't require a deep understanding of algebra to make the mistake; it's more about careful application of rules.

The best answer is C.
