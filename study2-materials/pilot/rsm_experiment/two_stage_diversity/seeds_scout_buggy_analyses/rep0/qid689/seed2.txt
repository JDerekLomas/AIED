## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply when solving the equation \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\) is inverting both sides of the equation incorrectly or misapplying the rule for solving equations involving fractions. A common error is to mistakenly think that to isolate \(p\), one should multiply both sides by \(p\) and then divide by 10, or simply inverting the fraction on the right side without properly applying algebraic operations.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with the misconception might proceed as follows:
1. Start with the given equation: \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\).
2. Incorrectly assume that to get rid of the fraction, they should multiply both sides by \(p\), but then mistakenly apply an incorrect step: \(10p = 5\).
3. Then, divide both sides by 10 to solve for \(p\): \(p = \frac{5}{10}\).
4. Simplify: \(p = 0.5\).

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
This misconception leads to the solution \(p = 0.5\), which corresponds to answer option A.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it stems from a misunderstanding of how to handle fractions in equations. Students might feel that multiplying or dividing by the denominator (or numerator) directly will solve the equation, not realizing the need to properly isolate the variable. It's a common enough mistake that students might not even realize they've gone wrong until they see the correct solution or are prompted to check their work. The mistake seems logical at first glance because it involves basic operations (multiplication and division) that students are familiar with, but it neglects the proper algebraic manipulation required.

The best answer is A.
