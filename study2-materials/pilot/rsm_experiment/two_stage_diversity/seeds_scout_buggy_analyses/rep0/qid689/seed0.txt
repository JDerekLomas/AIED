## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in solving the equation \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\) is inverting both sides of the equation incorrectly or misunderstanding the operation needed to isolate \(p\). A common error is to think that to get rid of the fraction, one should square both sides or simply invert both sides without properly handling the equation.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with the misconception might proceed as follows:
1. Start with the given equation: \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\).
2. Instead of multiplying both sides by \(p\) and then dividing by 10, the student might think to "get rid" of the fraction by inverting both sides, leading to: \(p = \frac{5}{10}\).
3. Simplify the fraction: \(p = 0.5\).

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Following the steps described, the student would arrive at \(p = 0.5\), which corresponds to option A.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves a simple and seemingly logical step of "getting rid" of the fraction. Students might not immediately realize they went wrong because their manipulation seems to follow a pattern of dealing with fractions (inverting), even though it's applied incorrectly here. It's a common enough mistake that students might not catch it unless they check their solution by substituting back into the original equation or are explicitly taught to verify solutions.

The best answer is A.
