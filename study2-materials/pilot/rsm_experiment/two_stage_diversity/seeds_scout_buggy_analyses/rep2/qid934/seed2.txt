## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or buggy procedure that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is attempting to solve the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) by isolating \(y\) but then mistakenly using a wrong or incomplete rearrangement, or not applying it correctly for the given \(x\) value, especially when trying to find \(y\) for \(x = 0\). However, a more common error might involve simply substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation but then making a calculation mistake or assuming a simpler relationship.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step
A student might incorrectly assume that to find \(y\) when \(x = 0\), they can simply substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\), getting \(4(0) + 2y = 10\), which simplifies to \(2y = 10\). Then, dividing both sides by 2 gives \(y = 5\). This step seems correct but let's examine if there's a specific buggy procedure: Another possible buggy procedure could be if a student thought they needed to "cancel" or directly assume \(y\) is related to \(x\) in a more straightforward linear fashion without applying algebraic manipulations properly.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
Based on the correct calculation:
When \(x = 0\), \(4(0) + 2y = 10\), simplifying to \(2y = 10\), hence \(y = 5\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
The correct calculation yields \(y = 5\) when \(x = 0\), which directly corresponds to one of the provided options.

The best answer is C.
