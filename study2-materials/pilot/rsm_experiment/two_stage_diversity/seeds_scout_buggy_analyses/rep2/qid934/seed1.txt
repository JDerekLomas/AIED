## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is misinterpreting the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) by incorrectly isolating \(y\) or misunderstanding how to substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation to solve for \(y\). A common mistake involves directly trying to solve for \(y\) without properly rearranging the equation or substituting \(x = 0\) correctly.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with the misconception might proceed as follows:
- The student looks at the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\).
- When \(x = 0\), the student incorrectly thinks, "If \(x = 0\), then \(2y = 10\), so \(y = 10 / 2 = 5\)." This step seems correct but let's examine if there are other procedural errors that could lead to the answer choices given.

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the correct calculation for \(x = 0\):
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[0 + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]
\[y = 5\]
This leads to answer option C.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
The error described doesn't actually lead to a wrong calculation in this case; it's a correct approach. However, a more common misconception could involve solving the equation for \(y\) in a general sense and then substituting \(x = 0\), which would still yield \(y = 5\) correctly. The calculation performed:
\[y = \frac{10 - 4x}{2}\]
\[y = 5 - 2x\]
Substituting \(x = 0\):
\[y = 5 - 2(0) = 5\]
is straightforward and does not inherently involve a misconception leading to an incorrect answer among the provided choices. The natural and attractive error might actually involve miscalculation or misinterpretation of the algebraic process, but in straightforward solving for \(y\) when \(x=0\), \(y = 5\) directly results.

The best answer is C.
