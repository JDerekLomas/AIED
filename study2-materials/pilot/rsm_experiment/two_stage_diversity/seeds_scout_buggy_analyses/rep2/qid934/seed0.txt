## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is reversing the roles of $x$ and $y$ or misinterpreting the equation $4x + 2y = 10$ by not following the correct order of operations or substituting values incorrectly. However, a common and specific misconception could be treating the equation as if $x$ and $y$ were interchangeable or not correctly solving for one variable in terms of the other.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
A student might mistakenly think that to find $y$ when $x=0$, they simply need to substitute $x=0$ into the equation without properly solving for $y$. The correct step is to substitute $x=0$ into $4x + 2y = 10$, yielding $4(0) + 2y = 10$, which simplifies to $2y = 10$, and hence $y = 5$. However, a student with a misconception might incorrectly manipulate the equation or assume a direct substitution results in an obvious solution.

## 3: Specify which answer option this misconception leads to.
If a student mistakenly assumes the equation implies $y$ can be directly derived without properly solving it or misunderstands the relationship between $x$ and $y$, they might incorrectly calculate. For instance, if they forget to divide by 2 when solving $2y = 10$, they'd incorrectly get $y = 10$, which isn't an option. The correct calculation yields $y = 5$ when $x = 0$. Let's verify if any option matches a simple mistake: For $x=0$, $4*0 + 2y = 10$; $2y = 10$; $y = 5$. This matches option C.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
The error of not properly substituting or solving for a variable is quite common and can be attractive because it often stems from a misunderstanding of algebraic manipulations rather than a calculation mistake. A student might not realize they went wrong if they've consistently applied an incorrect method or if they've made similar errors in the past that haven't been directly addressed. This particular scenario, however, leads directly to a recognizable solution path ($y=5$ for $x=0$), making it somewhat straightforward to identify as correct or incorrect based on the algebraic procedure.

The best answer is C.
