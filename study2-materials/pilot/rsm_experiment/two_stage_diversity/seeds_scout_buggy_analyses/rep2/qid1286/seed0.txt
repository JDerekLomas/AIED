## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is incorrectly manipulating the formula for the volume of a sphere, \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \), to solve for \( r \). A common error is mistakenly applying a linear relationship or incorrectly handling the exponent and coefficients when solving for \( r \).

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
Let's assume the student knows the volume formula for a sphere is \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \) but makes a mistake in solving for \( r \). A buggy procedure could involve incorrectly rearranging the formula. For example, a student might try to solve it as if it were a simple linear equation or incorrectly apply operations to isolate \( r \).

## 3: Specify the buggy procedure leading to an incorrect solution.
A student with the misconception might proceed as follows:
1. Start with \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \)
2. Multiply both sides by 3 to get \( 3V = 4 \pi r^3 \)
3. Divide by \( 4 \pi \) to get \( \frac{3V}{4 \pi} = r^3 \)
4. Take the cube root of both sides to solve for \( r \): \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4 \pi}} \)

## 4: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
This buggy procedure leads to the solution:
\[ r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \]
Which matches option C.

## 5: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is quite natural and attractive because it involves a straightforward but incorrect manipulation of the formula. The student might not realize they went wrong because:
- The steps seem logical at first glance.
- The student might be in a rush or not check their work thoroughly.
- The correct formula and the incorrect manipulation are close, making it easy to overlook the mistake.

The best answer is C.
