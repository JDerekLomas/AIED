## Step 1: Identify the correct formula for the volume of a sphere
The correct formula for the volume of a sphere is \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(V\) is the volume and \(r\) is the radius.

## 2: Rearrange the formula to solve for \(r\)
To find the radius \(r\), we rearrange the formula:
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
\[r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\]
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]

## 3: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
A common misconception involves misplacing or misinterpreting the coefficients and constants in formulas. Specifically, a student might incorrectly solve for \(r\) by mistakenly using \(4V\) instead of \(3V\) or misplacing \(\pi\) in the denominator or numerator. However, a prevalent error could be confusion in rearranging the formula, particularly in dealing with the fractions and \(\pi\).

## 4: Describe the misconception
The specific misconception here could involve incorrectly rearranging the volume formula. For instance, a student might mistakenly write:
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}\]
This corresponds to option B.

## 5: How a student with this misconception would work through the question
1. Start with \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\).
2. Multiply both sides by \(\frac{3}{4}\) to get: \(\frac{3}{4}V = \pi r^3\).
3. Divide both sides by \(\pi\): \(\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3\).
4. The mistake could occur here or in the next step if not carefully rearranging: If a student incorrectly aims to isolate \(r^3\) but swaps the coefficients or incorrectly handles \(\pi\), they might derive \(r^3 = \frac{4V}{3\pi}\) mistakenly.

## 6: Which answer option this misconception leads to
This misconception directly leads to option B: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}} \mathrm{cm}\).

## 7: Naturalness and detectability of the error
This error can be quite natural because it involves a common pitfall in algebraic manipulations, specifically in handling the coefficients of the formula (in this case, mistakenly using 4 instead of 3 or mishandling \(\pi\)). A student might not realize they went wrong, especially if they are in a hurry or if their previous work or check-ins with examples seemed to validate their manipulation.

## 8: Conclusion
The misconception involves incorrectly rearranging the volume formula for a sphere, leading to a mistaken expression for the radius. The correct expression is \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\), which matches option C. Therefore, option B represents a misconception.

The final answer is B.
