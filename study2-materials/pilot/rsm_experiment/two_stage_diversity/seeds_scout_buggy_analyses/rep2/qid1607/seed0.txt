## Step 1: Identifying the Misconception
The specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps is that he incorrectly isolates \(k\) in the equation \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\). The correct procedure to isolate \(k\) would involve multiplying both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which Isaac correctly does in Step 1 to get \(60 = 1 + k\). However, the error appears in assuming the next step is adding 1 to both sides or incorrectly solving for \(k\). A common misconception could be not understanding that to solve for \(k\), one should subtract 1 from both sides of the equation \(60 = 1 + k\), not add.

## 2: Describing the Procedural Error
The bug here specifically seems to be a misunderstanding of inverse operations or possibly carelessness. The correct step after \(60 = 1 + k\) would be to subtract 1 from both sides to isolate \(k\), yielding \(k = 59\). Isaac, however, seems to have made a calculation mistake or logical error in Step 2 by stating \(61 = k\), which does not follow from \(60 = 1 + k\) by standard algebraic manipulations.

## 3: Identifying the Correct Steps and Misconception
- Step 1 is correct: Multiplying both sides by 4 gives \(60 = 1 + k\).
- Step 2 is incorrect: Subtracting 1 from both sides should give \(k = 59\), not \(k = 61\).

## 4: Determining the Answer Option
Given Isaac's steps:
- Step 1 is correct (\(60 = 1 + k\)).
- Step 2 is incorrect (\(61 = k\) instead of \(59 = k\)).

This means only Step 1 is correct.

## 5: Naturalness of the Error
This error could be quite natural, especially for students who are not meticulous with their algebraic manipulations or who have not fully internalized the process of solving equations. The mistake of adding instead of subtracting (or vice versa) is common, as it relates to understanding the inverse operations necessary for solving equations. A student might not even realize they went wrong if they did not check their solution by substituting \(k\) back into the original equation.

## 6: Conclusion on Misconception and Steps
The specific misconception here involves incorrectly applying algebraic operations to solve for \(k\). The steps provided lead to the conclusion that:

The best answer is A.
