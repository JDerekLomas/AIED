## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps.
The specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps seems to be related to the handling of the equation \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\). In Step 1, Isaac multiplies both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which is a correct step: \(15 \times 4 = 1 + k\), resulting in \(60 = 1 + k\). This step is mathematically correct.

## 2: Analyze Step 2 for any misconception or error.
In Step 2, Isaac subtracts 1 from both sides to solve for \(k\): \(60 - 1 = k\), which gives \(59 = k\). However, Isaac writes \(61 = k\), which is incorrect. The correct calculation is \(60 - 1 = 59\), not \(61\). This indicates a simple arithmetic mistake rather than a deep-seated misconception about algebraic procedures.

## 3: Describe the misconception or bug precisely.
The bug here is not a misconception about algebra but a simple arithmetic error in Step 2. Isaac correctly applies the operation to isolate \(k\) but makes a calculation mistake.

## 4: Explain how a student with this misconception would work through the question.
A student who made a similar error might:
1. Start with the given equation: \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\).
2. Correctly multiply both sides by 4 to get \(60 = 1 + k\).
3. However, instead of correctly subtracting 1 from both sides to get \(k = 59\), they might mistakenly add 1 to 60 (thinking they need to add to both sides or simply making a calculation error), or in Isaac's case, incorrectly state \(k = 61\).

## 5: Determine which answer option the misconception leads to.
Given that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect due to a simple arithmetic error (\(61 = k\) instead of \(59 = k\)), the correct assessment is that only Step 1 is correct.

## 6: Assess how natural or attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error, while simple, can be attractive because it involves a basic arithmetic operation. A student might not realize they went wrong if they are not checking their work or if they are under time pressure. The mistake in Step 2 does not indicate a deep misunderstanding of algebraic principles but rather a lack of attention to detail in arithmetic.

## 7: Choose the correct answer based on the analysis.
Given that Step 1 is correct and Step 2 is incorrect, the best answer is A.

The best answer is A.
