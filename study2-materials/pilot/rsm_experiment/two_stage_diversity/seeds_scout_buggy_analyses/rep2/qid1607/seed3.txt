## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps.
The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). Isaac's steps involve multiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which results in \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \), simplifying to \( 60 = 1 + k \). This step is correct as it properly applies the operation to both sides of the equation.

## 2: Analyze Isaac's steps for errors.
Isaac's Step 1: \( 15 \times 4 = 60 = 1 + k \) is correct. He then subtracts 1 from both sides to solve for \( k \), resulting in \( 60 - 1 = k \), which simplifies to \( 59 = k \). However, Isaac writes \( 61 = k \) as his Step 2, indicating a mistake. The correct calculation after \( 60 = 1 + k \) is \( k = 60 - 1 = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 3: Determine the specific misconception or buggy procedure.
The specific misconception here appears to be a simple arithmetic error in solving for \( k \). After correctly getting \( 60 = 1 + k \), Isaac incorrectly calculates \( k \) as \( 61 \) instead of \( 59 \). This could be due to a miscalculation or a misunderstanding of the subtraction step.

## 4: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question.
A student with this misconception would start with the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \), multiply both sides by 4 to get \( 60 = 1 + k \), and then incorrectly solve for \( k \) by adding 1 to both sides instead of subtracting 1, or simply make an arithmetic mistake, resulting in \( k = 61 \) instead of \( k = 59 \).

## 5: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given that Step 1 is correct (\( 60 = 1 + k \)), but Step 2 is incorrect (\( 61 = k \) instead of \( 59 = k \)), the student has made an error in Step 2. Therefore, only Step 1 is correct, leading to answer option A: Only step 1.

## 6: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is relatively common, especially under pressure or when not checking work carefully. A student might not realize they went wrong if they don't properly check their solutions or substitute back into the original equation to verify their answer. The error seems attractive because it's a simple arithmetic mistake that can easily occur if not carefully checking each step.

The best answer is A.
