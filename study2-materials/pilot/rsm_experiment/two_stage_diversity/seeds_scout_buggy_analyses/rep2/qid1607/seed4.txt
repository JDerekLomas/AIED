## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception here appears to be related to the process of isolating a variable in an equation, particularly when dealing with fractions. Isaac's steps suggest he is attempting to solve the equation \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\) but seems to misunderstand the algebraic manipulation required.

## 2: Analyze Isaac's steps for errors
In Step 1, Isaac multiplies both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which results in \(15 \times 4 = 1 + k\), simplifying to \(60 = 1 + k\). This step is actually correct as it properly applies the multiplication property of equality.

## 3: Identify the error in subsequent steps
The error occurs in Step 2, where Isaac subtracts 1 from both sides to solve for \(k\), resulting in \(60 - 1 = k\), which simplifies to \(59 = k\). However, Isaac writes \(61 = k\), indicating a miscalculation. The correct calculation should yield \(k = 59\), not \(61\).

## 4: Describe the misconception
The misconception here seems to be a simple arithmetic error rather than a deep-seated algebraic misconception. Isaac correctly multiplies both sides by 4 but then incorrectly calculates \(k\).

## 5: Determine the correct answer option based on the analysis
Given that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 contains an error, we need to evaluate the answer choices. Since Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect due to a simple arithmetic mistake (\(60 = 1 + k\) leads to \(k = 59\), not \(61\)), the student with this approach would think both steps are attempts to solve the equation but only Step 1 is actually correct.

## 6: Assess the naturalness/attractiveness of the error
This error might be considered somewhat natural because it follows from a correct initial step, and the mistake in Step 2 could easily occur, especially under time pressure or in a moment of inattention. However, a student who carefully checks their work or uses a calculator to verify might quickly realize the mistake.

## 7: Conclusion
The specific misconception or procedural error here involves correctly applying an algebraic operation (multiplying by 4) but then making an arithmetic mistake. This leads to the conclusion that only Step 1 is correct.

The best answer is A.
