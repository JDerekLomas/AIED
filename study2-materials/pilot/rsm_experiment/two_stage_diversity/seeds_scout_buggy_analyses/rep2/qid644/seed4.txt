## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this scenario is the incorrect handling of the signs when multiplying two negative numbers. The bug here could be referred to as "ignoring the effect of two negative signs producing a positive product" or more simply, "forgetting that multiplying two negatives gives a positive".

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
A student with this misconception would likely multiply the two terms indicated by the arrows: \(-1 \times -4\). Instead of recognizing that two negative numbers multiplied together give a positive result, they might incorrectly conclude that the product of two negative numbers is negative.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
If the student thinks that \(-1 \times -4 = -4\), they would be applying the misconception that multiplying two negative numbers results in a negative number. This leads to answer option B: \(-4\).

## 4: Evaluate how natural/attractive this error is
This error can be quite natural and attractive to students who are still solidifying their understanding of integer multiplication, especially when dealing with negative numbers. The student might not even realize they went wrong because they might be relying on a pattern or rule that seems intuitive but is incorrect. For instance, they might mistakenly apply a rule similar to "adding two negative numbers gives a more negative number" to multiplication, not recognizing the different operation. This misconception could persist if not directly addressed through clear explanations and examples highlighting the correct rules for multiplying integers.

The best answer is B.
