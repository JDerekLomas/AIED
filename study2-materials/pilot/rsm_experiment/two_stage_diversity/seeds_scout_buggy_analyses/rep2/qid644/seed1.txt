## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this scenario is the incorrect handling of negative signs when multiplying two negative numbers. The bug here could be the failure to recognize that multiplying two negative numbers yields a positive result.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
A student with this misconception might think that when multiplying -1 by -4, the result is -4, because they mistakenly apply a rule that multiplying two negatives gives a negative. Normally, the correct step would be:
\[ (-1) \times (-4) = 4 \]
Because two negative numbers multiplied together give a positive number.

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to
Given the misconception that multiplying two negative numbers gives a negative result, the student would calculate:
\[ (-1) \times (-4) = -4 \]
This leads to answer option B: \( -4 \).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it's a common mistake to forget the rule that two negatives make a positive. Students might be so focused on performing the multiplication that they overlook the signs. Additionally, this mistake can be reinforced if students have previously made similar errors and not received corrective feedback. It's possible that the student might not realize they went wrong, especially if they are not checking their work or if they have not fully grasped the rule about multiplying negative numbers.

The best answer is B.
