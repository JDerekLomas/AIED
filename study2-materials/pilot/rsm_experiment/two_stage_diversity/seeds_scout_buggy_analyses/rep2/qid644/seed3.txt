## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is the incorrect handling of signs when multiplying negative numbers. A common bug is the mistaken application of the rule for multiplying positive and negative numbers, specifically thinking that multiplying two negatives gives a negative result.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
A student with the misconception that two negative numbers multiply to give a negative result would work through the question as follows:
- Identify the terms pointed to by the arrows: -1 from the first bracket and -4 from the second bracket.
- Multiply these two terms: \(-1 \times -4 = -4\).
So, the student would incorrectly conclude that multiplying \(-1\) and \(-4\) gives \(-4\).

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Based on the calculation \(-1 \times -4 = -4\), the student would select answer option B: \(-4\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is quite natural and attractive because it stems from a common misunderstanding of the rules for multiplying integers, specifically the mistaken belief that two negative numbers yield a negative product. Many students struggle with the abstract concept that two negative quantities can yield a positive result. This misconception might not be immediately apparent to the student as incorrect because it aligns with an intuitive but incorrect expectation about how negatives should interact. Students holding this misconception might not even realize they've made a mistake without feedback or further review of the correct rules for multiplying signed numbers.

The best answer is B.
