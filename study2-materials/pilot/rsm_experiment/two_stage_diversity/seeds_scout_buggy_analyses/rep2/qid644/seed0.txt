## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this situation is the incorrect handling of the signs when multiplying two negative numbers. The bug here could be the failure to recognize that multiplying two negative numbers yields a positive result.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with this misconception might think that when multiplying -1 (from the first bracket) by -4 (from the second bracket), they are simply multiplying the numbers without properly considering the signs. So, they might calculate it as \(-1 \times -4 = -4\), mistakenly believing that multiplying two negatives gives a negative.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the incorrect calculation \(-1 \times -4 = -4\), the student would choose option B) \(-4\), as they believe the product of -1 and -4 is -4.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive, especially for students who are still developing their understanding of integer operations and algebraic manipulations. The mistake of thinking that two negatives make a negative is a common one, as it confuses the rule for adding/subtracting integers (where two negatives make a positive) with the rule for multiplying integers (where two negatives make a positive). Students might not realize they went wrong if they are not fully confident in the rules of signs in multiplication or if they haven't had sufficient practice with applying these rules in algebraic contexts.

The best answer is B.
