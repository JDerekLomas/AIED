## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply is incorrectly handling the division or multiplication involving negative numbers, specifically thinking that dividing or multiplying by a negative number does not change the sign of the result or applying a wrong operation to isolate the variable.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
Given the equation \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \), a student with the misconception might think to simply divide both sides by \( -\frac{3}{4} \) but forget to change the sign of the result properly or mistakenly think that \( \star = -1 \div -\frac{3}{4} \) implies \( \star = \frac{-1}{-\frac{3}{4}} \) which can lead to confusion. The correct step should involve dividing both sides by \( -\frac{3}{4} \), which is mathematically equivalent to multiplying both sides by \( -\frac{4}{3} \) (the reciprocal of \( -\frac{3}{4} \)).

## 3: Apply the misconception to find the star.
If the student mistakenly does \( \star = -1 \div -\frac{3}{4} \) and calculates it as \( \star = \frac{-1}{-\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{4}{3} \), this would lead them to choose answer A: \( \frac{4}{3} \).

## 4: Evaluate how natural/attractive this error is.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it stems from a basic misunderstanding of how to solve for a variable in an equation involving fractions and negative numbers. Students might not realize they went wrong if they are not careful with the signs and operations, especially if they are used to working with positive numbers or have not fully grasped the rules for multiplying and dividing with negative numbers.

The best answer is A.
