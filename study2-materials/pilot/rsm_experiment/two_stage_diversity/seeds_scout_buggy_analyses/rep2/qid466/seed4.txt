## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is confusion between multiplication and division when solving for an unknown variable in an equation. More precisely, a common bug is forgetting to invert the fraction or incorrectly applying the operation to solve for the variable. However, a more fundamental issue here could be the inversion of operations when multiplying or dividing by a negative number and the reciprocal.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step
Given the equation \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \), a student might incorrectly think to "get rid" of the \( -\frac{3}{4} \) by doing the opposite operation of multiplication, which is division. However, their mistake could lie in not properly accounting for the negative sign or misapplying division.

Let's consider a possible mistaken approach:
1. Divide both sides by \( -\frac{3}{4} \), which they might incorrectly perform as \( \star = -1 \div \left(-\frac{3}{4}\right) \).
2. To divide by a fraction, some students incorrectly multiply by the fraction without inverting it, leading to \( \star = -1 \times \left(-\frac{3}{4}\right) \) instead of properly inverting to get \( \star = -1 \times \left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) \).

## 3: Execute the mistaken approach
Following the potential mistaken approach:
\( \star = -1 \times \left(-\frac{3}{4}\right) \)
\( \star = \frac{3}{4} \)

This leads the student to option C.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it's based on a common misunderstanding of how to isolate a variable when it's being multiplied by a fraction. Students might remember to "invert and multiply" when dividing by fractions, but they might not execute this correctly when there's a negative sign involved or when they're asked to solve for a variable that's being multiplied. This confusion can stem from not fully understanding the inverse operations, mixed up rules, or a lack of practice with equations involving fractions.

The best answer is C.
