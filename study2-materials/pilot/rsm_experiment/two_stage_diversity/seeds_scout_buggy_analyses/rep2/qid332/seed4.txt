## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception here involves understanding how to isolate a variable in an equation. Tom's suggestion, \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \), involves correctly adding 5 to both sides of the equation \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) to get \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). Katie's suggestion, \( x - 5 = 36 \), implies multiplying both sides of the original equation by 3, which would result in \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \). The error Katie makes is not immediately apparent but can be traced back to misunderstanding the operation needed to isolate \( x \) or incorrectly applying it.

## 2: Describe Katie's misconception
Katie's line of working, \( x - 5 = 36 \), suggests she multiplied the entire original equation by 3: \( \frac{x}{3} \cdot 3 - 5 \cdot 3 = 12 \cdot 3 \), which yields \( x - 15 = 36 \). However, she wrote \( x - 5 = 36 \), indicating a mistake in applying the multiplication. This shows a misconception of how to correctly apply operations to both sides of an equation to solve for \( x \).

## 3: Analyze Tom's and Katie's procedures step by step
- Tom starts with \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) and adds 5 to both sides, correctly getting \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \).
- Katie seems to multiply every term by 3: \( \frac{x}{3} \cdot 3 - 5 \cdot 3 = 12 \cdot 3 \), resulting in \( x - 15 = 36 \), which is a correct step but she mistakenly wrote \( x - 5 = 36 \).

## 4: Determine which answer option is correct based on the procedures
Tom is correct because adding 5 to both sides of \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) yields \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). Katie's suggestion, \( x - 5 = 36 \), does not accurately reflect a correct step from \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) since the correct multiplication by 3 would give \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \). Therefore, only Tom is correct.

## 5: Assess the naturalness/attractiveness of the error
The error Katie makes could be considered natural if one misunderstands how to distribute operations across the equation. Multiplying by 3 to clear the denominator is a standard technique, but it's crucial to apply it consistently. However, Katie's presentation of \( x - 5 = 36 \) directly might not immediately suggest to a student that an error occurred, as it looks like a simplistic approach.

## 6: Conclusion on the misconception and answer
The misconception here specifically is related to algebraic manipulation and the consistent application of operations to equations. Given Tom's correct manipulation and Katie's incorrect presentation of an otherwise valid step, we identify Tom as correctly solving the equation in a straightforward manner.

The best answer is A.
