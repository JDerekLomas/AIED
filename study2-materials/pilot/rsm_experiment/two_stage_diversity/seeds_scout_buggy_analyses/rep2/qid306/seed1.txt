## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error in this context is related to the order of operations, particularly the mistaken application of rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A common misconception among students is not following the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the problems step by step.
For Problem P: \(4 - 5 + 6\), a student with a misconception might incorrectly prioritize operations from left to right without considering the correct order of operations. However, in this case, the operations are all of equal precedence (addition and subtraction), so doing them from left to right is actually correct: \(4 - 5 + 6 = -1 + 6 = 5\). 

For Problem Q: \(4 + 5 \times 6\), a student might mistakenly think to do the addition first because it comes first from the left, which is a common error.

## 3: Specify the buggy procedure's implication on the answer choice.
If a student mistakenly applies operations from left to right regardless of the type (addition/subtraction before multiplication/division), for Problem Q, they might do \(4 + 5\) first instead of \(5 \times 6\). This mistake would lead them to choose:

- For Problem P: The correct approach is to do \(4 - 5\) first because both operations are of equal precedence.
- For Problem Q: The student might choose to do \(4 + 5\) first, which matches option A.

## 4: Analyze how natural/attractive this error is.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it seems logical to follow operations in the order they appear. Students might not realize they've gone wrong because the mistake aligns with a straightforward, left-to-right reading of the expression. It may take explicit instruction and practice with the order of operations for students to recognize and correct this misconception.

## 5: Conclusion on the specific misconception.
The specific misconception here involves failing to prioritize multiplication over addition, a key aspect of the order of operations (BODMAS/BPEMDAS). This directly points to option B as the incorrect calculation order due to misunderstanding: Problem P should indeed start with \(4 - 5\) since addition and subtraction have equal precedence and are performed from left to right, and Problem Q should start with \(5 \times 6\).

The best answer is B.
