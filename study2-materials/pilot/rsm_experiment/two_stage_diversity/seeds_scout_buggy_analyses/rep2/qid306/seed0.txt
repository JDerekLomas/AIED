## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The misconception here involves misunderstanding the order of operations in mathematics, specifically the difference between addition/subtraction and multiplication/division. The correct rule to follow is BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction) or PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction), but a common misconception is performing operations from left to right without adhering to the BODMAS/PEMDAS rules.

## 2: Identifying the Specific Misconception
The specific misconception or procedural error is applying operations strictly from left to right without prioritizing multiplication over addition/subtraction when there are no brackets. This means a student might incorrectly calculate Problem P as \(4 - 5 + 6\) by first doing \(4 - 5\) because it's on the left, and similarly, for Problem Q, they might incorrectly do \(4 + 5\) first because addition comes before multiplication in a left-to-right approach.

## 3: Describing the Error
The error is failing to recognize that in expressions without brackets, multiplication and division should be performed before addition and subtraction. Thus, for Problem Q, \(5 \times 6\) should be calculated before adding 4.

## 4: Student with This Misconception
A student with this misconception would:
- For Problem P: Do \(4 - 5 = -1\) first, then \(-1 + 6 = 5\).
- For Problem Q: Do \(4 + 5 = 9\) first, then \(9 \times 6 = 54\), ignoring the proper order.

## 5: Answer Option
This misconception leads to:
- Problem P: \(4 - 5\) being done first (which is correct according to BODMAS).
- Problem Q: \(4 + 5\) being done first (incorrect according to BODMAS).

## 6: Matching to Answer Option
The calculations that reflect this misconception are:
- Problem P: \(4 - 5\)
- Problem Q: \(4 + 5\)

## 7: Naturalness of the Error
This error can be quite natural/attractive because it feels intuitive to follow the order in which numbers appear. A student might not realize they've gone wrong unless they're specifically taught or exposed to problems where this incorrect approach leads to obviously wrong or inconsistent results.

## 8: Conclusion
The best answer is A. This option aligns with the misconception that one would perform operations strictly from left to right. Here’s the complete identification request:

## Step 1: Identifying the Misconception
The misconception here involves following operations from left to right without applying BODMAS.

## 2: Student's Procedure
Student does \(4 - 5\) then \(+6\) and \(4 + 5\) then \(\times 6\).

## 3: Corresponding Answer
This matches option A.

## 4: Attractiveness of Error
The error can be attractive because it seems logical to perform operations in the order they appear.

The best answer is A.
