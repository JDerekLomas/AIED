## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or buggy procedure that a UK Year 9 student might apply is adding the whole numbers and then adding the fractions without finding a common denominator for the fractions, but then incorrectly handling the fractions by adding their numerators and denominators separately or not converting them properly to have a common denominator.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
A student with this misconception might work through the question as follows:
1. Add the whole numbers: \(2 + 2 = 4\)
2. Add the fractions: \(\frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4}\)
   - Incorrectly add numerators and denominators: \(\frac{7+1}{10+4} = \frac{8}{14}\)
3. Combine the whole number and fraction parts: \(4 \frac{8}{14}\)

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
This misconception leads to answer option D: \(4 \frac{8}{14}\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves simple operations that seem correct at first glance. The student might not realize they went wrong because they successfully added the whole numbers and attempted to add the fractions. The mistake lies in the addition of the fractions' numerators and denominators, which might seem like a reasonable step to some students who are not fully aware of the need for a common denominator. This error can occur if a student remembers adding numerators but forgets about finding a common denominator.

The best answer is D.
