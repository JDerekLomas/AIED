## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in solving the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) is inverting the coefficient of \(p\) incorrectly or not applying it correctly. A common error could be multiplying both sides by 3 instead of dividing, or getting confused with the operation to isolate \(p\). However, a more precise bug related to common misconceptions in algebra could be the incorrect handling of fractions or coefficients. A specific buggy procedure could be: to solve for \(p\), a student might incorrectly think to multiply both sides by \(3\) (which would actually be an incorrect step if they meant to divide), but actually, the misstep could be more fundamentally about not properly isolating \(p\). A direct and common error would be not understanding that to isolate \(p\), one needs to divide both sides by 3.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
Let's say the misconception is about not properly applying division to isolate \(p\). Starting with:
\[3p = \frac{1}{12}\]

A student with the misconception might think:
- "To get \(p\) by itself, I need to get rid of the 3." But they might do it incorrectly by adding 3 to both sides or simply forgetting to divide:
\[3p + 3 = \frac{1}{12} + 3\]
which doesn't make sense for isolating \(p\), or they might incorrectly multiply:
\[3p \times 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times 3\]
But more accurately, for the division misconception:
- They should divide both sides by 3:
\[p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\]
But not knowing how to divide by 3 properly in fraction form, they might do:
\[p = \frac{1}{12} \times 3\]
which leads to:
\[p = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\]

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the incorrect step of multiplying by 3 instead of dividing by 3:
\[p = \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\]
This leads to option A: \(p = \frac{1}{4}\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because students might confuse operations or misremember the steps to isolate a variable, especially when fractions are involved. Multiplying by 3 seems like a straightforward step to get rid of the 3 next to \(p\), even though it's the wrong operation in this context. The student might feel they've made a reasonable step and not immediately identify it as an error without checking their solution or understanding the algebraic manipulation required.

The best answer is A.
