## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in solving the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) could be the incorrect handling of fractions when dividing or multiplying both sides of the equation by a number. A common bug is reversing the operation or misapplying it. However, a specifically prevalent misconception involves confusing the process of isolating the variable, particularly when dealing with fractional coefficients or constants.

## 2: Describe the misconception
A particularly common misconception is treating equations as if the operations are interchangeable without regard to the equation's constraints or the goal of isolating a variable. For the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\), a student might mistakenly believe they need to perform an operation on both sides that doesn't correctly isolate \(p\), or they might not properly apply the inverse operation to solve for \(p\).

## 3: Specific procedure with the misconception
Let's assume the misconception is: dividing by 3 on one side and thinking that on the other side they should directly divide \(\frac{1}{12}\) by \(3\) to get \(p\), not recognizing that to isolate \(p\), one needs to divide both sides by 3. A student might also mistakenly think to divide \(\frac{1}{12}\) by \(3\), but getting confused between division and multiplication of fractions. The error could be conceptual: incorrectly solving it as \(p = 3 \times \frac{1}{12}\) instead of \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\), or directly providing \(p = \frac{1}{36}\) without acknowledging the proper division by 3.

## 4: Step-by-step work through with the misconception
If a student mistakenly does \(p = 3 \times \frac{1}{12}\), their work might look like:
1. Start with \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\)
2. Multiply both sides by 3 incorrectly in their mind or \(p = 3 \times \frac{1}{12}\)
3. Calculate \(p = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\).

## 5: Identify which answer option the misconception leads to
This misconception leads to \(p = \frac{1}{4}\), which corresponds to option A.

## 6: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
This error can seem natural because to isolate \(p\), a student knows they need to "get rid" of the 3. Multiplying by 3 seems to them like a logical step because it's the inverse of subtraction/addition but less obviously wrong than other operations. Students often confuse operations; multiplication and division are particularly prone to reversals or complete omissions of correct methodology.

The best answer is A.
