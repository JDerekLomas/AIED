## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in solving the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) is reversing the operation when isolating the variable. Instead of dividing both sides by 3 to solve for \(p\), a student might mistakenly multiply both sides by 3.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with this misconception would start with the given equation:
\[3p = \frac{1}{12}\]

They would then incorrectly multiply both sides by 3 to "get rid" of the 3 on the left side:
\[3p \times 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times 3\]
\[9p = \frac{3}{12}\]
\[9p = \frac{1}{4}\]

Then, they would divide both sides by 9 to solve for \(p\):
\[p = \frac{1}{4} \div 9\]
\[p = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{9}\]
\[p = \frac{1}{36}\]

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
This misconception leads to the incorrect solution \(p = \frac{1}{36}\), which corresponds to answer option B.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be considered natural or attractive because it involves a common, albeit incorrect, strategy of "getting rid" of coefficients by applying the inverse operation in a mistaken manner. The student might not even realize they went wrong, especially if they are not confident in solving equations or if they are under time pressure. The calculation seems to follow a logical (though flawed) sequence, making it plausible that a student might not catch the mistake.

The best answer is B.
