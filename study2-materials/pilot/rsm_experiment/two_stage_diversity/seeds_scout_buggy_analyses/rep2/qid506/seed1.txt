## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in solving the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) is incorrectly applying the operation to isolate \(p\). A common mistake is to multiply both sides by \(3\) instead of dividing both sides by \(3\) to solve for \(p\).

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
A student with the misconception might proceed as follows:
1. Start with the given equation: \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\)
2. To isolate \(p\), the student might incorrectly multiply both sides by \(3\): \(3p \times 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times 3\)
3. This leads to: \(9p = \frac{3}{12}\)
4. Simplify \(\frac{3}{12}\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\): \(9p = \frac{1}{4}\)
5. Then, to solve for \(p\), the student might divide both sides by \(9\): \(p = \frac{1}{4} \div 9 = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{36}\)

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
Given the steps outlined, the student would arrive at \(p = \frac{1}{36}\), which corresponds to answer option B.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves a common operation (multiplication) that students are familiar with, but mistakenly apply in the wrong context. Students might not immediately realize they went wrong because the steps seem logical at first glance, especially if they are confused about the correct operation to use for isolating \(p\). The mistake of multiplying by \(3\) instead of dividing by \(3\) can be tempting, especially if the student is not confident in their algebraic manipulations or if they are used to solving equations with simpler coefficients.

The best answer is B.
