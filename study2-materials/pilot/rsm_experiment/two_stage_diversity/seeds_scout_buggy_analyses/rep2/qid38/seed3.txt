## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is adding the denominators of the fractions directly when trying to add them, instead of finding a common denominator. This can be referred to as the "denominator addition error" or incorrectly applying the rule for adding fractions.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
A student with this misconception would attempt to add the fractions by directly adding both the numerators and the denominators. So, for the given problem:
\[
\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}
\]
The student might proceed as follows:
1. Add the numerators: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
2. Add the denominators: \(2x + x = 3x\)
Therefore, the student would incorrectly simplify the expression to:
\[
\frac{7}{3x}
\]

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to
Based on the steps described, the misconception leads to answer option B: \( \frac{7}{3x} \).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
This error can be quite natural and attractive to students who are not fully comfortable with the procedure for adding fractions with different denominators. The mistake of adding denominators directly is a common error because it represents a simplistic and intuitive (but incorrect) approach to combining fractions. Students might not realize they went wrong because their method seems logical at first glance (e.g., adding parts together), and they might not have a strong conceptual understanding of why finding a common denominator is necessary. This makes the error potentially difficult for students to recognize as incorrect without feedback or further instruction.

The best answer is B.
