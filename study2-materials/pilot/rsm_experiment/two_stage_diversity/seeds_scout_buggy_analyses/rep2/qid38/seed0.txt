## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply is adding the denominators when adding fractions, rather than finding a common denominator. This can be referred to as the "additive denominator bug" or incorrectly applying the rule for adding fractions.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
A student with this misconception would work through the question as follows:
1. Start with the given expression: \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\)
2. Incorrectly add the denominators (or simply forget to find a common denominator), and add the numerators: \(\frac{3 + 4}{2x + x} = \frac{7}{3x}\)

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
Based on the student's incorrect steps, they would arrive at the answer: \(\frac{7}{3x}\). This matches option B.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong
This error is quite natural and attractive because it involves a simple and intuitive (but incorrect) application of operations. Students often struggle with the concept of finding common denominators and may intuitively feel that adding the denominators is a reasonable step, especially if they are used to adding numerators directly in other contexts. It's plausible that without checking their work against the rules for adding fractions or testing their solution, a student might not realize they've made a mistake.

The best answer is B.
