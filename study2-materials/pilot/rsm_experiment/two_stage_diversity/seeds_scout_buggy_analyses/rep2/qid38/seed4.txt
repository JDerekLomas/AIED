## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this scenario is adding the numerators and denominators separately when combining fractions, rather than finding a common denominator. This can be referred to as the "separate numerator and denominator addition" bug.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
A student with this misconception would work through the question as follows:
1. Start with the given expression: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \)
2. Add the numerators together: \( 3 + 4 = 7 \)
3. Add the denominators together: \( 2x + x = 3x \)
4. Write the result as a single fraction: \( \frac{7}{3x} \)

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to
This misconception leads to answer option B: \( \frac{7}{3x} \).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong
This error is quite natural and attractive because it involves a straightforward but incorrect application of operations. Students might find it appealing because it simplifies the process (no need to find a common denominator), and they might not immediately recognize the mistake without checking their work against the rules for adding fractions. The incorrect result looks plausible and does not obviously violate expectations about fractions, which might make it difficult for the student to spot the error without further algebraic manipulation or checking.

The best answer is B.
