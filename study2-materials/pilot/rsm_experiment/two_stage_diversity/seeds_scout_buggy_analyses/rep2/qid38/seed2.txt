## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error in this context could be the incorrect handling of adding fractions with different denominators, specifically failing to find a common denominator or misapplying the rules for adding fractions.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with the misconception that when adding fractions, you simply add the numerators and the denominators (which is incorrect), or another common mistake, adding the numerators but keeping one of the denominators instead of finding a common one, might proceed as follows:

1. Starting with \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \)
2. Incorrectly assuming that to add these, one could simply ignore finding a common denominator or think \(x\) and \(2x\) are the same, leading to:
\( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{2x} \) if they mistakenly changed \( \frac{4}{x} \) to have a \(2x\) denominator, which would actually be a correct step but let's explore a more common error.
3. Or more directly incorrectly, adding numerators and keeping one denominator: \( \frac{3 + 4}{2x} = \frac{7}{2x} \)

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
From the step above, if the student simply added the numerators (3+4) and kept the denominator as \(2x\) or incorrectly adjusted, they would get:
\( \frac{7}{2x} \)
This matches option D.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it simplifies the process significantly. Many students may not immediately see the need for a common denominator when the denominators appear related, like \(x\) and \(2x\). They might not realize they've gone wrong because it feels like they are doing a form of addition that seems logical (adding the tops, keeping the bottom somehow sensible). However, usually, with feedback or checking their work against a correct method (finding a common denominator, which for these fractions would result in \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \)), they would identify the mistake.

The best answer is D.
