## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is adding the numerators and denominators directly without finding a common denominator. This is often referred to as the "add-across" or "illegal combination" of fractions.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with the misconception of adding fractions by directly adding the numerators and denominators might work through the question as follows:

Given: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \)

1. The student might see \( \frac{3}{2x} \) and \( \frac{4}{x} \), and ignore the need for a common denominator.
2. They add the numerators: \( 3 + 4 = 7 \)
3. They add the denominators: \( 2x + x = 3x \) (or sometimes they might incorrectly add or average the denominators in a variant of this mistake).
4. The student then writes the result as \( \frac{7}{3x} \).

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Based on the steps described, this misconception leads to answer option B: \( \frac{7}{3x} \).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is quite natural and attractive because it simplifies the process of adding fractions to a step that seems logically similar to adding simple numbers. Many students initially struggle with the concept of finding a common denominator for fractions, and directly adding numerators and denominators can seem like a shortcut. It's possible that the student might not even realize they went wrong, especially if they haven't had sufficient practice with adding fractions with different denominators or if they haven't received clear feedback on similar mistakes.

The best answer is B.
