## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is confusing the exponentiation operation with multiplication, specifically thinking that \(x^2\) means \(x \times 2\) instead of \(x \times x\).

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
A student with this misconception would calculate \(y\) as follows:
Given \(y = 3x^2\) and \(x = 0.3\), they would mistakenly think \(x^2 = 0.3 \times 2 = 0.6\).
Then, they would calculate \(y = 3 \times 0.6 = 1.8\).

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Following the mistaken calculation from Step 2, the student would choose answer option C: \(1.8\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be considered natural or attractive because it involves a common misunderstanding of exponential notation. Students sometimes struggle to distinguish between \(x^2\) (meaning \(x\) squared) and \(2x\) (meaning \(2\) times \(x\)). Given that the correct calculation is \(y = 3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\), and without a clear understanding of the difference between these operations, a student might not even realize they went wrong, especially if they do not have a calculator or another method to check their answer.

The best answer is C.
