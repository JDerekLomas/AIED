## Step 1: Identifying the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is the incorrect application of the distributive property (also known as FOIL for binomials), specifically leading to an error in handling the signs of the terms when multiplying out the brackets. A common bug is mistakenly adding or subtracting the terms inside the brackets without properly accounting for their signs.

## 2: Describing the step-by-step process with the misconception
To work through the question step by step with this misconception, let's assume the student incorrectly applies the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) by forgetting to correctly handle the negative signs:
\[
(m-5)(m-7) = m \cdot m + m \cdot (-7) - 5 \cdot m - 5 \cdot (-7)
\]
The student might mistakenly write this as:
\[
= m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35
\]
However, a more likely mistake would involve incorrectly handling the signs during the calculation:
\[
= m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35
\]
Then simplify:
\[
= m^2 - 12m + 35
\]

## 3: Identifying the answer option resulting from the misconception
The misconception described leads to answer option B: \(m^{2}-12 m+35\). This matches the calculation where the student incorrectly handled the signs of the terms.

## 4: Evaluating the naturalness/attractiveness of the error
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it's based on a common misunderstanding of how to apply the distributive property with negative signs. Many students might not immediately realize they went wrong because the calculation seems to follow a logical sequence: multiply the first terms, then the outer, inner, and last terms, and finally combine like terms. The mistake here (resulting in B) actually reflects a correct application of FOIL but one that hasn't been checked for accuracy in sign handling. A more glaring mistake might lead to an easy identification of the error (like option D), but option B could easily arise from a miscalculation that seems plausible at first glance.

The best answer is B.
