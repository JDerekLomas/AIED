## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply when multiplying out the brackets \((m-5)(m-7)\) is the incorrect application of the distributive property, specifically adding the terms within the brackets instead of multiplying them and then combining like terms correctly. A common error is to add the constants and the coefficients of \(m\) separately without considering the signs.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with this misconception might work through the question as follows:
1. Multiply the first terms: \(m \times m = m^2\)
2. Multiply the outer terms: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
3. Multiply the inner terms: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
4. Multiply the last terms: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)
Then, instead of combining like terms correctly, they might incorrectly add/subtract the terms they got: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\). However, the specific bug here could be mistakenly thinking to add/subtract coefficients and constants directly without properly applying the FOIL method or distributive property, leading to an error such as forgetting to distribute the negative sign properly or misinterpreting the signs.

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the above steps, if a student mistakenly applies the procedure as:
\(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35\),
they would arrive at option D: \(m^2 - 12m - 35\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and if the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves a misunderstanding of how to apply the distributive property (or FOIL method) when multiplying two binomials. Students might not realize they went wrong if they do not check their work by substituting values for \(m\) or if they are not familiar with the correct expansion. For instance, substituting \(m = 0\) into the original expression gives \((0-5)(0-7) = (-5)(-7) = 35\), and into the incorrect answer \(0^2 - 12(0) - 35 = -35\), which would reveal the mistake. However, without such checks, students might confidently select an incorrect answer.

The best answer is D.
