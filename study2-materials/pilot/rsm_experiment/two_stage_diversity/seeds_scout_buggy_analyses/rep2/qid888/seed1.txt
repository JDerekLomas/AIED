## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply is incorrectly applying the rule for multiplying out brackets, specifically forgetting to consider the signs of the terms being multiplied. A common error is to only consider the products of the first terms and the last terms but incorrectly handling the signs.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
To multiply out \((m-5)(m-7)\), a student who mistakenly applies the procedure might do the following:

1. Multiply the first terms: \(m \times m = m^2\)
2. Multiply the outer terms: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
3. Multiply the inner terms: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
4. Multiply the last terms: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)

Then, they might incorrectly add these products together without properly considering the signs: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\).

However, a more direct misconception might involve directly adding/subtracting terms without proper application of distributive property or FOIL method, leading to an error like considering it as \(m^2 - (5+7)m + 35\) or similar incorrectly simplified expressions.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the typical FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last), the correct steps are:
- First: \(m \times m = m^2\)
- Outer: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
- Inner: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
- Last: \(-5 \times -7 = +35\)

Combining like terms: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

A common misconception that could lead to an incorrect answer is the incorrect handling of signs or not combining like terms properly. For instance, if a student incorrectly thought it was \(m^2 - (5-7)m - 35\) or made another sign error, they might not get any of the listed options directly, but let's assume they simplified wrongly to: 

If they thought \((m-5)(m-7) = m^2 - (5+7)m + 35\), which is \(m^2 - 12m + 35\), they actually got it right, not wrong. A mistake leading to \(m^2 + 12m + 35\) (option C) could be adding instead of subtracting the middle terms or misinterpreting the signs.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
The error can be quite natural, especially for students who are not thorough in applying the distributive property or the FOIL method. A student might mistakenly add the constants within the brackets and incorrectly apply subtraction/addition, making \(m^2 + 12m + 35\) an attractive incorrect option if they've simply added \(5 + 7 = 12\) and then mistakenly didn't subtract or add it properly, showing a mix-up in operations.

For \((m-5)(m-7)\), if mistakenly calculated as \(m^2 - (negative \ of\ (5+7))m + 35\) or similar, or not accounting for two negative signs properly leading to \(+35\), it could misleadingly suggest \(m^2 - 12m + 35\) as 'correct'. A less likely but natural mistake specifically leading to D) might involve \(-7m -5m = -12m\) properly identified but failing to apply \(+35\) due to miscalculating last terms or misunderstanding their products.

The best answer is B.
