## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply is incorrectly applying the distributive property (also known as FOIL for binomials) by forgetting to consider the signs of the terms within the brackets or misapplying them. A common bug is adding or subtracting the wrong terms due to sign errors.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
To apply the FOIL method correctly: 
\[
(m-5)(m-7) = m \cdot m + m \cdot (-7) - 5 \cdot m - 5 \cdot (-7)
\]
\[
= m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35
\]
\[
= m^2 - 12m + 35
\]

However, a student with a misconception might do:
\[
= m \cdot m + m \cdot 7 - 5 \cdot m - 5 \cdot 7
\]
\[
= m^2 + 7m - 5m - 35
\]
\[
= m^2 + 2m - 35
\]

Or another possible error could be:
\[
= m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35
\]
But incorrectly written as:
\[
= m^2 - 12m - 35
\]
without realizing the error in signs or operations.

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
The misconception described could lead to various incorrect answers depending on the nature of the error. For instance, a sign error or incorrect operation could result in:
- $m^2 + 2m - 35$ (not listed),
- $m^2 - 12m - 35$ (Option D).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural, especially if the student is not meticulous with signs or has a shallow understanding of the distributive property. The student might not realize they went wrong if they:
- Don't check their work by substituting values for $m$.
- Are not confident in their ability to multiply out brackets.
- Haven't been explicitly taught to check the signs of products and sums.

The best answer is D.
