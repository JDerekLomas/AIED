## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is the incorrect application of the distributive property or FOIL method, specifically adding the numbers inside the brackets instead of multiplying them appropriately and then combining like terms. A common mistake is to consider the operation inside the brackets as if it were addition or subtraction only, rather than multiplication.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
To illustrate this mistake, let's assume the student incorrectly applies a simplified or incorrect method:
1. The student starts with \((m-5)(m-7)\).
2. Instead of using FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last), they think of it as \(m(m) - 5(m) - 7(m) - 5(-7)\) or misapply some form of distributive property incorrectly.
3. Calculate each term: \(m^2 - 5m - 7m + 35\).
4. The student then combines like terms: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

However, a more common error related to this specific question might involve mistakenly applying a rule or forgetting to distribute correctly, such as:
\((m-5)(m-7) = m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\), which correctly leads to \(m^2 - 12m + 35\) but through an assumed buggy step that involves incorrect term consideration.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
The student's work through might directly lead to answer B: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\), if they properly apply the FOIL method but initially were led astray by a misconception. The correct step:
- First: \(m \cdot m = m^2\)
- Outer: \(m \cdot -7 = -7m\)
- Inner: \(-5 \cdot m = -5m\)
- Last: \(-5 \cdot -7 = 35\)
Adding those together correctly gives: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\), which matches B.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This particular "error" actually leads to the correct answer if done properly, making it less obvious as a misconception. Normally, a natural error might involve incorrectly adding or subtracting within the multiplication or forgetting to multiply. For instance, treating \((-5)(m-7)\) as \(-5m - (-5 \cdot 7)\) which then inaccurately gets computed. The error of adding inner terms incorrectly (i.e., mistakenly calculating as if direct addition/subtraction within the brackets were what mattered) isn't very natural; instead, what's often seen is neglect of the correct sign application across multiplication.

The best answer is B.
