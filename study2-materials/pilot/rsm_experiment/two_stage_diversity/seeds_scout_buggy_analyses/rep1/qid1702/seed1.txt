## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is reversing the order of operations or misapplying algebraic manipulations, specifically when solving for one variable in terms of another in a linear equation. However, a common and specific bug could be treating the equation as if it were solved for \(y\) directly and then confusing the substitution process.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
Let's assume the misconception involves directly substituting \(y\) without properly rearranging the equation. The equation given is \(10x - 6y = 30\).

1. A student might start by trying to solve for \(x\) when \(y = 0.5\), but let's say they mistakenly try to substitute \(y = 0.5\) directly without rearranging the equation properly: \(10x - 6(0.5) = 30\).
2. They then solve for \(x\): \(10x - 3 = 30\).
3. Next, they add 3 to both sides: \(10x = 33\).
4. Finally, they divide by 10: \(x = 3.3\).

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Based on the steps described, if a student mistakenly substitutes \(y = 0.5\) into the equation and solves incorrectly by not properly isolating \(x\) or \(y\), but follows through with incorrect algebra, they might end up with \(x = 3.3\). So, the misconception leads to answer option C.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves a straightforward, but incorrect, substitution and solving process. Students might not realize they went wrong because their algebraic manipulations seem logical at each step, given their misunderstanding of the equation. They might not catch their mistake unless they're checking their work against known solutions or using a graphical tool for verification.

The best answer is C.
