## Step 1: Identifying the Misconception
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is the incorrect handling of the equation $10x - 6y = 30$ when substituting $y = 0.5$. A common misconception could be not following the order of operations correctly or making a mistake when isolating $x$.

## 2: Describing the Misconception
A more precise bug could be the mistake of incorrectly applying algebraic operations, specifically when solving for $x$. Let's consider a common error where the student correctly substitutes $y = 0.5$ into the equation but then makes a miscalculation.

## 3: Step-by-Step Error Analysis
The equation given is $10x - 6y = 30$. If $y = 0.5$, a student might substitute it into the equation as follows:
\[10x - 6(0.5) = 30\]
\[10x - 3 = 30\]
However, a common procedural error could involve incorrect rearrangement or calculation. For instance, if a student mistakenly simplifies or solves the equation incorrectly:
\[10x = 30 + 3\]
\[10x = 33\]
\[x = \frac{33}{10}\]
\[x = 3.3\]

## 4: Identifying the Correct Answer Based on the Misconception
Given the calculations:
- A student with the misconception might simply not check their work or realize they applied the formula incorrectly, leading them to select their calculated value.

## 5: Assessing the Attractiveness of the Error
The misconception leading to $x = 3.3$ seems plausible because it involves simple arithmetic. This natural step might not immediately appear wrong to a student, especially if they do not recheck their calculations or substitute back into the original equation.

## 6: Detailed Evaluation
The equation solved correctly for $x$ when $y = 0.5$ is:
\[10x - 6y = 30\]
\[10x - 6(0.5) = 30\]
\[10x - 3 = 30\]
\[10x = 33\]
\[x = 3.3\]
So, let's verify if this matches any options:
- The calculation directly gives $x = 3.3$, which matches one of the options directly without any further misconceptions.

The best answer is C.
