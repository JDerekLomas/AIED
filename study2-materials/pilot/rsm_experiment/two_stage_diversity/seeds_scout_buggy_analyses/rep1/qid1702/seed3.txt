## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply is reversing the operations when substituting known values into an equation to solve for an unknown. However, a more common and relevant misconception here could be not substituting the given $y$ value into the equation correctly or misinterpreting how to rearrange the equation to solve for $x$. A precise bug could be the incorrect rearrangement of the equation $10x - 6y = 30$ to solve for $x$, specifically dividing or multiplying by coefficients incorrectly.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
Let's assume the student incorrectly rearranges the equation. The correct steps should be:
1. Substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$.
2. This gives $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$.
3. Simplify to get $10x - 3 = 30$.
4. Add 3 to both sides to get $10x = 33$.
5. Divide by 10 to get $x = 3.3$.

A student with a misconception might:
- Incorrectly substitute or simplify, for example, $10x - 6y = 30$ becomes $10x = 30 + 6y$ (correct so far), then $10x = 30 + 6(0.5)$, which correctly becomes $10x = 30 + 3 = 33$, and then $x = 33 / 10 = 3.3$. This actually leads to the correct answer, indicating the need for a different kind of misconception.

A plausible misconception could involve incorrect handling of negative numbers or misunderstanding the order of operations:
- If a student mistakenly thought $-6y$ meant $-6 \times -0.5$ (which would not be a correct mistake here since $y=0.5$ is positive), or got the sign wrong in rearranging.

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Let's consider an incorrect approach: If a student mistakenly solved as $10x = 30 - 6y$ (which is actually right), then $10x = 30 - 6(0.5) = 30 - 3 = 27$, so $x = 27 / 10 = 2.7$. 

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is.
The error leading to $x = 2.7$ seems relatively natural if one misunderstands or misapplies basic algebraic manipulations. However, it seems there was an oversight in identifying a clear misconception pathway that leads directly to an incorrect answer choice provided. 

Given $y = 0.5$, substituting into $10x - 6y = 30$ yields:
\[10x - 6(0.5) = 30\]
\[10x - 3 = 30\]
\[10x = 33\]
\[x = 3.3\]

So, if we were to consider options and mistakes:
- Correct calculation yields $x = 3.3$.

The best answer is C.
