## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error in this context could be related to the incorrect application of the order of operations (BODMAS/BPEMDAS), where a student might mistakenly perform operations from left to right without considering the hierarchy of operations. For Problem P: \( 4-5+6= \), a common correct approach is to perform the operations from left to right since they are of the same precedence (addition and subtraction). For Problem Q: \( 4+5 \times 6= \), the correct approach according to BODMAS/BPEMDAS is to perform multiplication before addition.

## 2: Describe a student with a misconception working through the question
A student with a misconception might incorrectly believe that for both problems, they should either perform all operations from left to right or apply an incorrect rule. For Problem P, performing from left to right is actually correct: \( 4 - 5 + 6 \) which is \( -1 + 6 = 5 \). However, for Problem Q, incorrectly doing \( 4 + 5 \) first before \( 5 \times 6 \) is a mistake. The correct calculation for Problem Q is \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) then \( 4 + 30 = 34 \). A student might mistakenly think both problems should start with the operation on the left, leading them to choose \( 4 - 5 \) for Problem P and \( 4 + 5 \) for Problem Q.

## 3: Determine which answer option the misconception leads to
Given the potential misconception of performing operations solely from left to right without applying the correct order of operations, the student might choose:
- For Problem P: \( 4 - 5 \)
- For Problem Q: \( 4 + 5 \)

This matches option A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and Problem Q: \( 4+5 \).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
This error is relatively natural and attractive because, at a basic level, operations are often performed from left to right in simple calculations. Students might not fully grasp the need for BODMAS/BPEMDAS until they encounter problems that explicitly require its application, like Problem Q. The error might not seem wrong to a student who hasn't yet internalized the rule for the order of operations, especially if they've only dealt with simple calculations previously.

The best answer is A.
