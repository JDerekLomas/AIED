## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in solving the equation \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\) is inverting both sides of the equation incorrectly or misunderstanding the operation to isolate \(p\). A common misconception is to multiply both sides by \(p\) but then not properly isolate \(p\), or simply to invert the fraction on the right side without adjusting the equation correctly.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student might start with the equation:
\[10 = \frac{5}{p}\]

They might think to "get rid" of the fraction by multiplying both sides by \(p\), which is a correct step:
\[10p = 5\]

However, a misconception could arise if they then try to solve for \(p\) by simply dividing 5 by 10, which they might mistakenly believe is the correct operation to isolate \(p\), or they might not properly account for the multiplication across the equation:
\[p = \frac{5}{10}\]

\[p = 0.5\]

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
This line of reasoning leads to:
\[p = 0.5\]

So, the misconception leads to answer option A: \(p = 0.5\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves simple operations that students are familiar with. The student starts correctly by multiplying both sides by \(p\) to clear the denominator but then fails to properly solve for \(p\). The mistake might seem reasonable because it involves basic arithmetic operations. A student might not realize they've gone wrong because the steps seem logical and they might not check their solution by substituting \(p = 0.5\) back into the original equation to verify its validity.

The best answer is A.
