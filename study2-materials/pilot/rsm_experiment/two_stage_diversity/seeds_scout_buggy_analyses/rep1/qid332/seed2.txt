## Step 1: Identify the correct next steps in solving the equation
To solve the equation \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \), the correct next step would involve isolating \( \frac{x}{3} \) on one side. This can be done by adding 5 to both sides of the equation, which indeed yields \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). Therefore, Tom's suggestion is correct.

## 2: Analyze Katie's suggestion
Katie suggests that a correct next line of working could be \( x - 5 = 36 \). To assess this, let's see how she might have gotten this. If we multiply every term in the original equation by 3 to clear the fraction, we get \( x - 15 = 36 \). Katie's line \( x - 5 = 36 \) does not follow from the original equation through standard algebraic manipulations. The error seems to be in the multiplication step; she likely multiplied by 3 but forgot to multiply the \(-5\) by 3, resulting in \(-5\) instead of \(-15\).

## 3: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception here for Katie is failing to apply the operation (in this case, multiplication by 3) consistently across all terms of the equation. This is a common error and can be considered a form of "inconsistent application of operations" or more specifically, a failure in maintaining the equality by not performing the same operation on both sides.

## 4: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question
A student with Katie's misconception would start with \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) and then multiply every term by 3, getting \( x - 5 = 36 \) instead of the correct \( x - 15 = 36 \). They might not realize their error because they think they are just getting rid of the fraction.

## 5: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
Given Tom's suggestion is correct and Katie's is not derived from a valid operation on the original equation, only Tom is correct. This leads to answer option A: Only Tom.

## 6: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
The error of not multiplying all terms by the same factor (or adding/subtracting the same value to both sides) is very natural and attractive because it's easy to overlook the need to perform operations on all parts of the equation equally. Students might not immediately realize they've made a mistake, especially if they're not in the habit of checking their work through substitution or other means.

The best answer is A.
