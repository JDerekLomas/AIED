## Step 1: Understand the task and the students' statements
The task is to evaluate two students' (Tom and Katie) proposed steps for solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) and identify any mathematical misconceptions.

## 2: Evaluate Tom's statement
Tom suggests the next line of working could be \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). To verify this, we add 5 to both sides of the given equation: \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5\), which simplifies to \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This is a correct application of algebraic procedure to isolate \(x\).

## 3: Evaluate Katie's statement
Katie suggests the next line of working could be \(x - 5 = 36\). To achieve this from the original equation, she would have multiplied both sides by 3: \(3 \times (\frac{x}{3} - 5) = 3 \times 12\), which gives \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\). This indicates Katie's proposed step is incorrect.

## 4: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception here relates to Katie's misunderstanding. It seems she might have incorrectly applied the multiplication step or misunderstood how to clear the fraction. However, a more precise bug related to common misconceptions isn't directly identified with Katie's step without assuming her process. A common error involves mishandling operations or forgetting to distribute, but Katie's error seems to be in not properly applying the multiplication to both terms.

## 5: Analyze Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrectness in detail
Tom's step is algebraically correct. Katie's step of \(x - 5 = 36\) would imply she didn't accurately multiply the entire left side of the equation by 3; she would have gotten \(x - 15 = 36\) if she had correctly multiplied \(-5\) by 3.

## 6: Assess the misconception and options
The bug here for Katie seems to involve incorrect distribution or understanding of equation manipulation. If she meant to do \(3 \times \frac{x}{3} - 3 \times 5 = 36\), then it would be \(x - 15 = 36\), showing a lack of proper operation on the constant term.

## 7: Determine which student(s) are correct
Given Tom's correct manipulation (\(\frac{x}{3} = 17\)), only Tom provides a correct next line of working.

## 8: Classify the errors and their naturalness
Katie's mistake seems fairly natural because it could result from accidentally not accounting for the distribution of multiplication over subtraction properly.

## 9: Choose the appropriate answer option
Since Tom is correct and Katie is not, the correct answer option is A) Only Tom.

## 10: Describing the specific misconception
1. The misconception here is Katie's apparent failure to distribute the multiplication by 3 to both parts of the left-hand side correctly, leading to \(x - 5 = 36\) instead of \(x - 15 = 36\).
2. A student mistakenly thinking multiplying a subtraction equation by a number only affects one term could work through the question thus: Start with \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\), then mistakenly try to deal with \(x\) directly, ending with Katie's \(x - 5 = 36\) by an erroneous distribution of operations.
3. This misconception directly leads to option A) Only Tom, as Tom correctly manipulated the equation.
4. This error could feel natural or attractive if one overlooks or misunderstands algebraic manipulations, possibly because distribution across addition/subtraction terms is common but easy to get wrong.

The best answer is A.
