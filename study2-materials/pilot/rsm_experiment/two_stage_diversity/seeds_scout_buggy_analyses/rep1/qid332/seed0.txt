## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception here seems to revolve around the handling of equations, specifically how to isolate the variable \(x\) in the given equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\). Tom's suggestion, \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), appears to correctly add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate \(\frac{x}{3}\). Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), seems to misunderstand the operation needed to isolate \(x\), as she multiplies both sides of the original equation by 3 but then doesn't account for the distribution correctly.

## 2: Analyze Tom's procedure.
Tom's procedure involves adding 5 to both sides of the equation: \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5\), which simplifies to \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This is a correct algebraic manipulation.

## 3: Analyze Katie's procedure.
Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\). To get to this line from the original equation, \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\), she likely multiplied every term by 3: \(\frac{x}{3} \cdot 3 - 5 \cdot 3 = 12 \cdot 3\), which results in \(x - 15 = 36\). Katie's line, \(x - 5 = 36\), indicates she forgot to multiply the -5 by 3, revealing a misunderstanding of how to apply operations to all parts of an equation equally.

## 4: Determine the misconception.
The misconception Katie exhibits is a failure to apply the operation (in this case, multiplication by 3) consistently across all terms of the equation. This is an example of the "bug" where students selectively apply operations to parts of an equation rather than to every term, which we've identified as Katie's error.

## 5: Step-by-step working through the question with the misconception.
Let's see how Katie might work through it:
1. Start with \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\).
2. Multiply every term by 3 but make the mistake: \(x - 5 = 36\).
3. Solve for \(x\): \(x = 36 + 5 = 41\).

## 6: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given Tom's correct next step (\(\frac{x}{3} = 17\)) and Katie's incorrect next step (\(x - 5 = 36\)), we conclude:
- Tom is correct because \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5\) indeed yields \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\).
- Katie is incorrect because multiplying by 3 should yield \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\).

## 7: Assess how natural/attractive this error is.
The error Katie makes (failing to distribute the multiplication across all terms) is quite common, especially among students who are still solidifying their understanding of algebraic manipulations. It might not be immediately obvious to her that she went wrong, as the step seems reasonably close to a correct manipulation.

## 8: Conclusion on who is correct and the nature of the misconception.
Tom is correct. Katie exhibits a common misconception related to algebraic manipulations. Therefore, the correct answer choice reflects that only Tom's next line of working is accurately described as correct.

The best answer is A.
