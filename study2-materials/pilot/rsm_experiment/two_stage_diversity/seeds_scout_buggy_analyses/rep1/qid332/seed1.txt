## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error in this context involves understanding how to isolate a variable in an equation. Tom's suggestion, \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \), directly addresses the equation \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) by adding 5 to both sides, which is a correct procedure. Katie's suggestion, \( x - 5 = 36 \), seems to misinterpret the operation needed to solve the equation; it appears she multiplied every term by 3 but didn't correctly adjust the constant term on the right side of the equation.

## 2. Describe Katie's misconception
Katie's proposed step, \( x - 5 = 36 \), implies she multiplied both sides of the original equation \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) by 3. The correct multiplication would yield \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \). This indicates Katie's mistake involves incorrect handling of the constant term when multiplying through by 3.

## 3: Identify the misconception
The misconception here is the incorrect application of algebraic operations to both sides of an equation when trying to isolate the variable. Specifically, Katie incorrectly applied the multiplication across the equation without properly adjusting all terms.

## 4: Analyze Tom's procedure
Tom's suggestion, \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \), is derived by adding 5 to both sides of the equation \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \), resulting in \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). This is a standard and correct algebraic procedure.

## 5: Determine who is correct
Given that Tom's step is correct (\( \frac{x}{3} = 12 + 5 = 17 \)), we evaluate Katie's step. If Katie multiplied the entire original equation by 3, she should get \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \). So, Katie is incorrect.

## 6: Describe the specific misconception or procedural error (be precise — name the bug)
The bug here is an incorrect application of algebraic manipulation, specifically multiplying through by a constant (in this case, 3) without properly adjusting all parts of the equation.

## 7: How a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step
A student with this misconception might proceed as follows:
1. Start with \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \).
2. Multiply every term by 3: \( x - 5 = 36 \) (incorrectly written, as it should be \( x - 15 = 36 \)).

## 8: Which answer option (A/B/C/D) this misconception leads to
This misconception leads to Katie being incorrect, and thus only Tom is correct.

## 9. How natural/attractive this error is
The error is relatively natural, especially for students who are still developing their algebraic skills. Multiplying through by 3 to clear the fraction seems like a reasonable step, but not adjusting the -5 correctly (to -15) can easily occur if one is not meticulous about applying the operation to every term.

The final answer is A.
