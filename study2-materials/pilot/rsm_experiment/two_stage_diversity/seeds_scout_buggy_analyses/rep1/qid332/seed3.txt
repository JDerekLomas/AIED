## Step 1: Identify the correct procedure for solving the equation
To solve the equation \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \), the correct next step would be to add 5 to both sides, resulting in \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). This matches Tom's suggestion, indicating his approach is correct.

## 2: Analyze Katie's suggestion
Katie suggests \( x - 5 = 36 \) as a next line of working. To evaluate this, let's see how one might derive it. If we multiply every term in the original equation by 3 to clear the fraction, we get \( x - 15 = 36 \). Katie's suggestion of \( x - 5 = 36 \) does not accurately reflect this process, as it mistakenly maintains the -5 instead of adjusting it to -15 after multiplying by 3.

## 3: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The misconception here seems to be related to incorrectly applying algebraic operations to solve equations, specifically in handling coefficients and constants. However, Katie's error seems to stem from a misunderstanding of how to properly manipulate the equation when trying to isolate \(x\). A common error could be failing to apply operations to all terms correctly or misinterpreting how to clear fractions or deal with constants.

## 4: Describe Katie's misconception step by step
If a student like Katie starts with \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \), they might think to multiply every term by 3 to get \( x - 5 = 36 \), which they could do if they mistakenly forgot to multiply the -5 by 3. The correct step would be \( \frac{x}{3} \cdot 3 - 5 \cdot 3 = 12 \cdot 3 \), resulting in \( x - 15 = 36 \).

## 5: Determine which answer option the misconception leads to
Given Tom's suggestion is correct and Katie's is incorrect due to a procedural error (not properly applying the multiplication to the constant term), we conclude that only Tom is correct.

## 6: Assess the naturalness/attractiveness of the error
The error Katie makes could be considered somewhat natural because it's easy to overlook the need to multiply every term by 3 when trying to clear the fraction. Students might focus on getting rid of the fraction and overlook applying the operation to all parts of the equation equally.

## 7: Final assessment of who's correct and the type of misconception
The specific misconception here involves incorrect application of algebraic manipulations, particularly in distributing operations across terms. Tom is correct because \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \) directly follows from adding 5 to both sides of the equation. Katie's error leads to option A: Only Tom.

The best answer is A.
