## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is the incorrect application of the order of operations, specifically ignoring or misapplying the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule. BIDMAS/BODMAS stands for Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction, which dictates the order in which operations should be performed in mathematical expressions.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with the misconception that addition should be performed before division (or not following the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule correctly) might work through the expressions as follows:

For \(8+12 \div 4\):
1. Add 8 and 12: \(8 + 12 = 20\)
2. Divide 20 by 4: \(20 \div 4 = 5\)

For \((8+12) \div 4\):
1. Add 8 and 12 inside the brackets: \(8 + 12 = 20\)
2. Divide 20 by 4: \(20 \div 4 = 5\)

However, the correct step for the first expression should follow BIDMAS/BODMAS:
1. Divide 12 by 4: \(12 \div 4 = 3\)
2. Add 8 and 3: \(8 + 3 = 11\)

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the incorrect calculation:
- \(8+12 \div 4 = 5\)
- \((8+12) \div 4 = 5\)

The student with this misconception would conclude that \(8+12 \div 4 = (8+12) \div 4\), because both equal 5. This leads to the conclusion that the correct symbol is \(=\), which corresponds to answer option C.

## 4: Evaluate how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is quite natural and attractive because it stems from a common misunderstanding of the order of operations. Many students, especially at the Year 9 level, may not have fully internalized the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule or may apply it inconsistently. The error seems reasonable because, at first glance, it appears to follow a logical (though incorrect) sequence of operations. Students might not realize they went wrong unless they are explicitly taught to follow the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule and see the correct application of it, or unless they encounter a problem where this incorrect approach leads to an obviously incorrect result.

The best answer is C.
