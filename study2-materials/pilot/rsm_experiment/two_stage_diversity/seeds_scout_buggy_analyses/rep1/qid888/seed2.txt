## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply is incorrectly applying the distributive property (or FOIL method) when multiplying out brackets, specifically adding or subtracting the wrong terms. A common error is not correctly handling the signs when multiplying the terms.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with the misconception might work through the question as follows:
1. Apply the FOIL method: First, Outside, Inside, Last.
2. Multiply the First terms: \(m \times m = m^2\)
3. Multiply the Outside terms: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
4. Multiply the Inside terms: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
5. Multiply the Last terms: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)
6. Combine like terms: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\)

However, a more common misconception could be mistakenly combining the terms or incorrectly handling the negative signs. For example, some students might incorrectly calculate it as:
\(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35\)

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
This misconception leads to answer option D: \(m^{2}-12 m-35\), because the student might have subtracted the products of the outside and inside terms (instead of adding them) or simply got the constant term wrong.

## 4: Evaluate how natural/attractive this error is.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it often stems from careless handling of negative signs or a misunderstanding of how to combine like terms after applying the FOIL method. A student might not even realize they went wrong if they feel confident in their application of the FOIL method but did not accurately compute the products or their combination.

The best answer is D.
