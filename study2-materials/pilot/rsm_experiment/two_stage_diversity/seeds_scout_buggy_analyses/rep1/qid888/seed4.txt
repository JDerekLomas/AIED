## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply when multiplying out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\) is incorrectly applying the distributive property or FOIL method, specifically adding the terms instead of subtracting when dealing with negative signs outside the brackets. A common error is not correctly handling the subtraction of terms.

## 2: Describe the step-by-step procedure with the misconception
The correct FOIL method for \((m-5)(m-7)\) is:
1. First: \(m \times m = m^2\)
2. Outer: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
3. Inner: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
4. Last: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)

Then, combine like terms: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

A student with the misconception might incorrectly do:
1. First: \(m \times m = m^2\)
2. Outer: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
3. Inner: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
4. Last: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)

But then incorrectly combine the terms, perhaps by incorrectly handling the signs or mistakenly adding/subtracting the middle terms, for example, mistakenly thinking \(-7m - 5m = -12m\) but forgetting to adjust for the correct signs in the final combination, actually leading to:
\[m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35\]

Or directly they might do:
\[m^2 - (5 + 7)m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\]

But a buggy procedure could also be mistakenly believing \(-7m - 5m\) equals \(-2m\).

## 3: Determine the answer option the misconception leads to
If a student mistakenly combines \(-7m - 5m\) as \(-2m\) instead of \(-12m\), they might get:
\[m^2 - 2m + 35\]

However, no option directly matches adding (like \(m + m\) or direct mistaken calculations leading straightforward to existing choices). A closer mistaken application could actually directly reflect confusion similar resulting in an answer such as \[m^2-12m-35\] for misplaced subtraction: assuming to improperly add and not follow sign alteration accurately.

## 4: Evaluate how natural/attractive this error is
This error can be quite natural, especially if the student does not carefully keep track of signs during multiplication. If a student consistently overlooks the distributive property when dealing with negative numbers or simply does the calculation rapidly without checking, such a mistake seems pretty “reasonable.” Most particularly if they commonly perform arithmetic more rapidly, thus providing plausible grounds where error manifests subtly but quite regularly to. That could well then result more naturally (without thorough sign tracking).


The best answer is B.
