## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply is incorrectly applying the distributive property (also known as FOIL for binomials) but making a mistake in the signs. A common error is not properly handling the subtraction within the brackets, specifically when multiplying out \((m-5)(m-7)\), students might mistakenly add the constants or incorrectly handle the signs.

## 2: Describe the step-by-step procedure with the misconception
A student with the misconception might work through the question as follows:
- First, they multiply the first terms: \(m \times m = m^2\)
- Then, they multiply the outer terms: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
- Next, they multiply the inner terms: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
- Finally, they multiply the last terms: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)
So, they get: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\)

## 3: Identify which answer option the misconception leads to
The misconception described leads to the answer option: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\), which is option B.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it results from a common misunderstanding of how to multiply out brackets, especially with negative signs involved. Students might not realize they went wrong if they are not meticulous about checking their work against the rules of algebra. The error seems plausible because it involves a straightforward application of FOIL but with an incorrect handling of signs or terms, making it a believable mistake.

The best answer is B.
