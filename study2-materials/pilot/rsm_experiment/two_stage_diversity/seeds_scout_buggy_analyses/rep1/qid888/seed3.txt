## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is the incorrect application of the distributive property (or FOIL method) when multiplying out the brackets, specifically adding the numbers inside the brackets instead of subtracting them or multiplying them correctly. However, a more common and precise bug in this context could be the error of not properly changing the signs when subtracting one term from another inside the parentheses.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
A student with the misconception might incorrectly apply the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) as follows:
\[
(m-5)(m-7) = m \cdot m + m \cdot (-7) - 5 \cdot m - 5 \cdot (-7)
\]
However, let's consider another common error where a student might mistakenly think the operation inside the brackets directly translates to the multiplication result without correctly handling the signs:
\[
= m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35
\]
But then mistakenly add the middle terms or incorrectly handle the subtraction:
\[
= m^2 - 12m - 35
\]
or another mistaken step could be directly multiplying and then trying to combine like terms with the wrong operation.

## ₃## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
The student with the described misconception would likely arrive at option D: \( m^{2}-12 m-35 \) because they might multiply the terms correctly as:
\[
m \cdot m = m^2, \quad m \cdot (-7) = -7m, \quad -5 \cdot m = -5m, \quad -5 \cdot (-7) = 35
\]
Then combine them:
\[
= m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35
\]
\[
= m^2 - 12m + 35
\]
Actually, let's correct and specify: if the misconception involves not changing signs properly:
The correct expansion using FOIL is:
\[
= m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35
\]
\[
= m^2 - 12m + 35
\]
So, option B is the correct expansion, not the error. The student making a straightforward mistake like not correctly handling negative signs or terms might genuinely consider \( m^2 - 12m - 35 \) as the result of mixing up operations.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is.
The error leading to \( m^2 - 12m - 35 \) (option D) could be natural if the student mistakenly adds instead of subtracts the constant term, or wrongly handles negative signs in multiplication. The mistake is quite plausible because when students first learn to multiply out brackets, they often focus on the multiplication part and might struggle with correctly applying the signs.

## 5, To properly align: Describe:
The best answer is D.
