## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in solving the equation \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \) is not inverting the fraction when solving for the variable, but more specifically, the misconception could be about incorrectly handling the negative sign when isolating the variable or forgetting to invert when multiplying or dividing by a fraction.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
A common misconception involves incorrectly applying the operations to solve for \( \star \). Let's say the student incorrectly thinks: to isolate \( \star \), I should divide both sides by \( -\frac{3}{4} \), which might lead them to write:
\[ \star = -1 \div \left(-\frac{3}{4}\right) \]
Or,
\[ \star = -1 \times \left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) \]
However, let's consider a more fitting misconception where a student gets confused with signs or operations:
If a student incorrectly manipulates the equation, for example, by simply changing the sign of \( -\frac{3}{4} \) to positive without properly inverting it when dividing, they'd go:
\[ -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \]
\[ \star = \frac{-1}{-\frac{3}{4}} \]
\[ \star = \frac{4}{3} \]

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
The student with the misconception of not properly inverting or misinterpreting the sign would end up choosing:
A) \( \frac{4}{3} \) because they simplify the division by \( -\frac{3}{4} \) as \( -1 \div -\frac{3}{4} = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it stems from confusion about how to handle fractions in equations and perhaps a tendency to "get rid" of the negative sign without fully applying algebraic rules. A student might feel they are doing the right thing by making the fraction positive directly without fully executing the division or multiplication steps correctly.

The best answer is A.
