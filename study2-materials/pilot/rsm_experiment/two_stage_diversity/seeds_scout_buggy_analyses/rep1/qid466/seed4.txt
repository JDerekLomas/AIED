## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in solving the equation \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \) is neglecting to apply the sign correctly when isolating the variable, specifically multiplying or dividing both sides of the equation by a negative number without properly changing the sign.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
A student with the misconception might work through the question as follows:
1. Start with the given equation: \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \)
2. To isolate \(\star\), the student might divide both sides by \(-\frac{3}{4}\), but incorrectly ignore the sign change: \( \star = -1 \div -\frac{3}{4} \) or incorrectly do \( \star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} \) which simplifies directly to \( \star = \frac{4}{3} \) without properly accounting for the division by a negative number or assuming division and multiplication by a fraction are directly analogous without sign consideration.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
Given the steps that might be incorrectly followed, let's evaluate the operation directly: to solve \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \) correctly, one would divide both sides by \( -\frac{3}{4} \), which is the same as multiplying both sides by \( -\frac{4}{3} \). This yields \( \star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \). The misconception where signs are not properly managed could lead the student to overlook whether \( \star \) should be positive or negative, but applying division (or multiplication by the reciprocal) correctly gives \( \star = \frac{4}{3} \), and thus A is an option. However, the direct error seems to align less with a standard mistake on this kind of problem and more direct is seeing \( -1 \div -\frac{3}{4} \) mistakenly managed as positive to a mistaken student.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
The error can be natural and attractive because, initially, students might get hung up on the operations and not adequately consider the signs or proceed as they've seen on numerous non-mixed-sign problems. This can easily occur if not reinforced to always handle the signs accurately when performing operations. Upon reevaluation: 
- To get A (\( \frac{4}{3} \)), one mistakenly (given typical procedures) does operations while forgetting to adjust \( -1 \times - \frac{4}{3}= \frac{+4}{3} \). The initial intuition to overlook details gives such answers credence incorrectly without checking against established algebraic handling, suggesting students see a familiar form.

The best answer is A.
