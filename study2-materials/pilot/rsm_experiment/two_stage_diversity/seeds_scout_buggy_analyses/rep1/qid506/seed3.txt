## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in solving the equation $3p = \frac{1}{12}$ is incorrectly handling the division by 3. A common mistake is to multiply both sides by 3 instead of dividing by 3, but another prevalent error involves misunderstanding the operation to isolate $p$. However, a precise bug could be the incorrect application of inverse operations or mishandling fractions.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
Let's assume the misconception involves incorrectly applying the division step, such as mistakenly multiplying or confusing the operation. For the equation $3p = \frac{1}{12}$, the correct step to solve for $p$ is to divide both sides by 3:
\[ p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 \]
However, a student with a misconception might think:
\[ p = \frac{1}{12} \times 3 \]
\[ p = \frac{3}{12} \]
\[ p = \frac{1}{4} \]

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
The misconception of multiplying by 3 instead of dividing by 3 leads to:
\[ p = \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{1}{4} \]
So, this misconception leads to answer option A: $p = \frac{1}{4}$.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is quite natural and attractive because it involves a common operation mistake. Students might confuse the inverse operation needed to solve for $p$, or they might simply miswrite or miscalculate the division as multiplication, especially under time pressure or when not fully attentive to detail. It's reasonably likely that a student wouldn't immediately realize they went wrong, especially if they've made similar errors in the past or if they haven't thoroughly checked their work.

The best answer is A.
