## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in solving the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) could be failing to properly divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \(p\). A common misconception involves misapplying operations or misunderstanding the order of operations, but in this simple case, a likely error is not reversing the operation correctly when isolating \(p\).

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
If a student mistakenly thinks that to get \(p\) by itself, they should multiply \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3 instead of dividing by 3, their steps would look like this:
1. Start with \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\)
2. Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \(p\): \(p = 3 \times \frac{1}{12}\)
3. Calculate \(p\): \(p = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\)

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to
This misconception leads the student to calculate \(p = \frac{1}{4}\), which corresponds to answer option A.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves a common operational mistake. Students might mistakenly apply the inverse operation incorrectly or forget to do the correct inverse operation (in this case, dividing by 3). The mistake seems logical at first glance because the student is still performing an operation with the number 3; they just mistakenly choose multiplication instead of division. This kind of error might not be immediately obvious to the student as incorrect because it follows from a misapplication of a familiar procedure rather than a completely irrational step.

The best answer is A.
