## Step 1: Specific Misconception or Procedural Error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply is incorrectly handling the fraction when isolating \( p \) in the equation \( 3p = \frac{1}{12} \). A common mistake could involve not dividing both sides of the equation by 3 correctly, possibly due to confusion with fraction operations.

## 2: Step-by-Step Workthrough with Misconception
A student might mistakenly think to "get rid" of the 3 by multiplying both sides by 3 instead of dividing, or they might incorrectly apply fraction division rules. Let's say the misconception involves not correctly dividing the fraction by 3. A buggy step could look like this:
1. Start with \( 3p = \frac{1}{12} \)
2. To isolate \( p \), the student might do: \( p = \frac{1}{12} \times 3 \) instead of \( p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 \) or \( p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} \).
3. Calculate: \( p = \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \).

## 3: Identifying the Answer Option
Given the calculation with the misconception: \( p = \frac{1}{4} \), this leads to answer option A.

## 4: Naturalness of the Error
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves a simple operation that seems intuitive (multiplying to get rid of the coefficient), but it's applied incorrectly in the context of solving for \( p \). The student might not even realize they went wrong because the operation seems logical at first glance. However, this mistake arises from not following the correct algebraic procedure of dividing both sides by 3, which would give \( p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36} \). The error is plausible and might not stand out as incorrect without checking the solution in the original equation or realizing the mistake through peer or teacher feedback.

The best answer is A.
