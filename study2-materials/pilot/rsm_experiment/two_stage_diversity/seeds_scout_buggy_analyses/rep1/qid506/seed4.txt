## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in solving the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) is incorrectly applying the operation to isolate \(p\), specifically thinking that to isolate \(p\), one should multiply both sides by \(3\) instead of dividing both sides by \(3\). This can be described as a "misapplication of inverse operations" or more specifically, "incorrectly using multiplication instead of division to solve for \(p\)".

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with this misconception would start with the equation:
\[3p = \frac{1}{12}\]

Instead of dividing both sides by \(3\) to solve for \(p\), they might multiply both sides by \(3\), believing this isolates \(p\):
\[3p \times 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times 3\]
\[9p = \frac{3}{12}\]
\[9p = \frac{1}{4}\]

Then, to solve for \(p\), they would divide both sides by \(9\):
\[p = \frac{1}{4} \div 9\]
\[p = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{9}\]
\[p = \frac{1}{36}\]

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Following the steps outlined in Step 2, the student would arrive at:
\[p = \frac{1}{36}\]

This matches answer option B.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves a common operation (multiplication) and might seem like a logical step to some students, especially if they are not confident in applying inverse operations to solve equations. The student might not even realize they went wrong because their algebraic manipulation looks correct to them, and they might not check their solution by substituting \(p = \frac{1}{36}\) back into the original equation to verify its validity. For example, substituting \(p = \frac{1}{36}\) into the original equation:
\[3 \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{12}\]
\[\frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{12}\]

This verification step would actually show that \(p = \frac{1}{36}\) is correct, suggesting that the initial analysis of the misconception might have been incorrect in assuming the student's path was mistaken. Let's correct that:

The correct steps to solve \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) are:
\[p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\]
\[p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}\]
\[p = \frac{1}{36}\]

So, \(p = \frac{1}{36}\) is actually the correct solution, making option B the correct answer without any misconception.

The best answer is B.
