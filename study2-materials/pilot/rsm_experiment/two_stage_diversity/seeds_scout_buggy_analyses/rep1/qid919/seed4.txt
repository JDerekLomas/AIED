## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this scenario is confusing the operation to be performed with the exponent. A common error is to mistakenly believe that to calculate \(y = 3x^2\), one should multiply \(x\) by \(2\) and then multiply by \(3\), rather than squaring \(x\) and then multiplying by \(3\). This can be described as the "linearize the exponent" bug or more precisely, incorrectly applying the exponent rule by treating \(x^2\) as \(x \times 2\).

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with this misconception, when given \(x = 0.3\) and the equation \(y = 3x^2\), might proceed as follows:
1. Substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation.
2. Mistakenly calculate \(x^2\) as \(0.3 \times 2 = 0.6\).
3. Then, multiply by \(3\): \(3 \times 0.6 = 1.8\).

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Based on the mistaken calculation described in Step 2, the student would arrive at \(y = 1.8\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive, especially for students who are still solidifying their understanding of algebraic expressions and the order of operations. The mistake involves a superficially reasonable but incorrect manipulation of the equation. Students might not realize they went wrong, especially if they are accustomed to dealing with linear relationships and are not yet deeply familiar with the effects of squaring numbers. The error does not necessarily violate basic arithmetic facts or the order of operations in a glaringly obvious way, making it plausible that a student could make this mistake without immediately recognizing it.

The best answer is C.
