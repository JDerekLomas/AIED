## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps.
The specific misconception here appears to be the incorrect handling of the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \) when solving for \( k \). In Step 1, Isaac multiplies both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which is correct: \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \), resulting in \( 60 = 1 + k \). However, the error occurs in the execution and interpretation of the steps rather than the algebraic manipulation itself. The actual algebraic manipulation in Step 1 is correct.

## 2: Analyze Step 2 for any misconceptions.
In Step 2, Isaac subtracts 1 from both sides of the equation \( 60 = 1 + k \) to solve for \( k \), which yields \( 60 - 1 = k \), and thus \( k = 59 \). However, Isaac writes \( 61 = k \), indicating a calculation error. The correct calculation is \( 60 - 1 = 59 \), not \( 61 \). This suggests a simple arithmetic mistake rather than a deep-seated algebraic misconception.

## 3: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with a similar misconception might:
1. Start with the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \).
2. Multiply both sides by 4 to get \( 60 = 1 + k \), which is correct.
3. However, when solving for \( k \), they might incorrectly subtract 1, or make an arithmetic error, leading to an incorrect value for \( k \).

## 4: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given Isaac's steps:
- Step 1 is correct: \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \), so \( 60 = 1 + k \).
- Step 2 is incorrect because \( k = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

Thus, only Step 1 is correct. This leads to answer option A: Only step 1.

## 5: Assess how natural/attractive this error is.
The error in Step 2, resulting in \( k = 61 \) instead of \( k = 59 \), is a simple arithmetic mistake. Students might not realize they went wrong if they are not meticulous with their calculations or if they do not check their work. This type of error can be attractive because it might seem plausible, especially under timed conditions or if the student is not checking their arithmetic carefully.

The best answer is A.
