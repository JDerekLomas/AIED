## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps.
The specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps is the incorrect handling of the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \) when solving for \( k \). In Step 1, Isaac multiplies both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which is correct: \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \), resulting in \( 60 = 1 + k \). However, the error occurs in the execution and interpretation of this step, not in the step itself. The actual error is in Step 2, where Isaac adds 1 to both sides incorrectly or implies an incorrect operation: if \( 60 = 1 + k \), then subtracting 1 from both sides gives \( k = 59 \), not \( k = 61 \) as Isaac states.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
A student with the misconception might start with the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). They might think to multiply both sides by 4 to clear the fraction, which is correct: \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \), getting \( 60 = 1 + k \). Then, to solve for \( k \), they might incorrectly add 1 to both sides (or misunderstand the operation needed), leading to \( 60 + 1 = k \), which results in \( k = 61 \). This shows a misunderstanding of basic algebraic operations, specifically in solving for a variable.

## 3: Determine which answer option (A/B/C/D) this misconception leads to.
Given Isaac's steps: Step 1 is correct (\( 60 = 1 + k \)), but Step 2 is incorrect (\( 61 = k \) should be \( 59 = k \)). Therefore, only Step 1 is correct. This leads to the conclusion that the correct answer option is A: Only step 1.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would even realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural, especially for students who are new to algebra or struggling with the concept of isolating variables. The mistake of adding 1 instead of subtracting it (or vice versa) is common, as students might confuse the operations or forget to perform them correctly. It's attractive because it seems logical to add or subtract without fully considering the equation's balance. A student might not realize they went wrong if they don't check their solution by substituting \( k = 61 \) back into the original equation, which would clearly show that \( 61 \) is not a correct solution.

The best answer is A.
