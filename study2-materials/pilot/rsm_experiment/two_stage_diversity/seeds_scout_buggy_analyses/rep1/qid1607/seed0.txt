## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error in Isaac's steps appears to be the incorrect handling of the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \) when he multiplied both sides by 4 to get \( 60 = 1 + k \), which is correct. However, the error seems to be in assuming this step and the subsequent step are correct without properly solving for \( k \). The actual error is in Step 2, where he adds 1 to both sides implicitly to solve for \( k \) but doesn't show the correct algebraic manipulation.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
Starting with \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \), a student might correctly multiply both sides by 4 to get \( 60 = 1 + k \). To solve for \( k \), they should subtract 1 from both sides, yielding \( k = 59 \). However, if a student mistakenly thinks they can simply add 1 to 60 to solve for \( k \) without showing the subtraction step, they might write \( 61 = k \) as Isaac did, mistakenly adding 1 instead of subtracting it.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
Given Isaac's steps:
- Step 1: \( 60 = 1 + k \) is correct.
- Step 2: \( 61 = k \) is incorrect because it should be \( k = 59 \) after subtracting 1 from both sides of \( 60 = 1 + k \).

So, only Step 1 is correct. This leads to answer option A: Only step 1.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
This error can be quite natural and attractive because it involves a simple and common operation (addition/subtraction) that students are familiar with. The mistake here is not in the operation itself but in applying it correctly to isolate \( k \). Students might easily overlook the need to subtract 1 from both sides after multiplying by 4, especially if they are used to solving equations where the variable is on one side and the constant on the other, or if they rush through the steps.

The best answer is A.
