## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception here appears to be related to the process of isolating the variable \(k\) in the equation \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\). A common error when solving equations involving fractions is incorrectly multiplying or dividing by the denominator or not distributing it properly. However, in this case, let's examine Isaac's steps closely. In Step 1, he multiplies both sides by 4 to clear the fraction, which seems correct: \(15 \times 4 = \frac{1+k}{4} \times 4\), resulting in \(60 = 1 + k\). This step appears to be correct.

## 2: Analyze Step 2 for misconception
In Step 2, Isaac subtracts 1 from both sides to solve for \(k\), which yields \(60 - 1 = k\), or \(59 = k\). However, Isaac writes \(61 = k\), indicating he added 1 instead of subtracting it. This suggests the error is not in the algebraic operation to clear the fraction but in the simple arithmetic operation to isolate \(k\).

## 3: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question
A student with this misconception (adding instead of subtracting 1) would:
1. Start correctly: \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\)
2. Multiply both sides by 4: \(60 = 1 + k\)
3. Incorrectly solve for \(k\): \(k = 60 + 1 = 61\), reflecting the misconception of adding 1 instead of subtract 1.

## 4: Identify the correct answer option based on the misconception
Given Isaac's steps:
- Step 1 is correct: \(60 = 1 + k\)
- Step 2 is incorrect because it should be \(k = 59\), not \(61\).

Thus, only Step 1 is correct, which aligns with option A.

## 5: Assess the naturalness/attractiveness of the error
This error can be quite natural, especially under pressure or if a student is not thoroughly checking their work. Adding instead of subtracting (or vice versa) is a common arithmetic mistake. The student might not even realize they went wrong if they don't double-check their calculations or if their misconception is rooted in a lack of understanding of the equation-solving process.

The best answer is A.
