## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error in this context could be related to the incorrect application of the formula for calculating the mean. The mean is calculated by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the count of numbers. A common misconception could involve omitting one of the numbers from the summation or incorrectly counting the numbers.

## 2: Describe a likely misconception
A likely misconception here is the " omission of a data point" from the calculation or "incorrect count of data points." This could manifest as either adding all the numbers but dividing by an incorrect count or adding an incorrect subset of numbers.

## 3: Apply the misconception to the given problem
A student with the misconception of omitting a data point (in this case, possibly overlooking the 0) might proceed as follows:
- They would ignore the 0 and add the remaining numbers: \(1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15\).
- Then, they would divide by what they believe to be the total count of numbers, which might be 4 if they are counting the numbers they actually used: \( \frac{15}{4} \).

## 4: Match the misconception to an answer option
This incorrect procedure matches option C: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \), because it incorrectly omits the 0 from the summation and also incorrectly uses 4 as the divisor, presumably believing there are only 4 numbers being considered.

## 5: Evaluate the naturalness/attractiveness of the error
This error is quite natural and might not be immediately obvious to the student. The student might genuinely believe they are only supposed to use "non-zero" or "significant" numbers, or they might have miscounted the data points. Such errors can be attractive because they simplify the calculation or align with an intuitive (though incorrect) understanding of which numbers to include.

## 6: Determine the best answer
Given that option C represents a calculation where the student likely omitted the 0 and divided by what they thought was the correct number of observations (4, possibly because they forgot to count the 0), and considering option A as the correct method: \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \), it's clear that only option A gives the correct mean.

The best answer is D.
