## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error in this context is the incorrect handling of the division in relation to the parentheses and the application of algebraic conventions. Specifically, a common misconception involves incorrectly distributing or misinterpreting the order of operations, particularly in expressions involving division by an algebraic expression. A prevalent bug involves adding or subtracting within the numerator instead of maintaining it as is when dividing by an expression.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with the misconception might think that when dividing by an expression like \( (h+4) \), they should somehow incorporate the terms within the parentheses into the numerator or denominator in a way that reflects addition or subtraction across the division operator. For instance, they might justify that since you have \( c \) divided by \( (h+4) \), you should add \( c + 4 \) into the numerator to reflect some sort of combination or correction.

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the calculation \( c \div (h+4) \), a student mistakenly thinking to alter the numerator by somehow incorporating the \( +4 \) might arrive at \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \). This corresponds to option B. The mistaken logic here might involve misunderstanding of how operations are grouped and handled.

## 4: Discuss how natural/attractive this error is and if the student would realize they went wrong.
This misconception can be quite natural and attractive to students who are not yet firmly grounded in algebraic conventions. Many students initially struggle with understanding that division by a sum (or difference) does not involve adding (or subtracting) parts of that sum to (or from) the dividend. The visual and structural similarity between the expression \( c \div (h+4) \) and the flawed interpretation leading to option B might make the mistake seem plausible to someone not steeped in recognizing algebraic structure and precedent. Moreover, without a clear conceptual understanding or frequent practice in recognizing correct algebraic expressions, students might not immediately realize their mistake, especially if their error results in an expression that (to them) "looks right" or follows what they recall from simpler arithmetic operations. 

The best answer is B.
