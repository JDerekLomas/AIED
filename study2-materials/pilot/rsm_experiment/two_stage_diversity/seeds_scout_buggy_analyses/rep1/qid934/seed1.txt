## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is reversing the operations or misinterpreting the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\). A common error could be the student thinking they can solve for \(y\) by simply isolating \(y\) without properly rearranging the equation or substituting \(x = 0\) correctly.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
If a student mistakenly thinks that to find \(y\) when \(x = 0\), they can just rearrange the equation as \(y = 4x + 2 \times 10\) or misinterpret the equation, let's consider a more plausible mistake: A student might try to solve the equation for \(y\) by incorrectly substituting or rearranging. For instance, they might think:
- Given \(4x + 2y = 10\), to find \(y\) when \(x = 0\), they substitute \(0\) for \(x\): \(4(0) + 2y = 10\).
- This simplifies to \(2y = 10\), and then \(y = 10 / 2 = 5\).

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the incorrect approach described, the student would find \(y = 5\) when \(x = 0\). Therefore, this misconception leads to answer option C: \(5\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive, especially if the student is not fully comfortable with algebraic manipulations or if they are in a hurry. The mistake involves a simple arithmetic operation and a misunderstanding of how to apply the given equation. The student might not even realize they went wrong because their calculation seems straightforward and correct given their misunderstanding of the equation. They might not question their substitution or rearrangement process, especially if they don't have a correct solution to compare with.

The best answer is C.
