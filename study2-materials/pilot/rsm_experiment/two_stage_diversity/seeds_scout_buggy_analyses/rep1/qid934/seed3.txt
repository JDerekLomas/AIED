## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is treating the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) as if it implies \(y = 4x + 2\), ignoring the coefficients properly, or not substituting \(x = 0\) correctly into the equation to find \(y\). However, a common and specific error could be misunderstanding how to rearrange the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) to solve for \(y\).

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
Let's assume the misconception involves not fully understanding algebraic manipulation or isolation of variables. A student's steps might look like this:

1. The student starts with \(4x + 2y = 10\).
2. To find \(y\) when \(x = 0\), the student might incorrectly substitute or rearrange the equation. For \(x = 0\), the equation becomes \(2y = 10\).
3. Solving \(2y = 10\) for \(y\), the student finds \(y = 10 / 2 = 5\).

This seems straightforward and correct for substituting \(x = 0\), but let's proceed to evaluate the options and misconceptions.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Following the correct and straightforward algebraic manipulation:
- For \(x = 0\), substituting into \(4x + 2y = 10\) gives \(4(0) + 2y = 10\), simplifying to \(2y = 10\), and thus \(y = 5\).

So, the value that should replace the star (\(\bigstar\)) is indeed \(5\), which corresponds to option C.

## 4: Evaluate how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
The calculation seems naturally correct for finding \(y\) when \(x = 0\):
\(4(0) + 2y = 10 \Rightarrow 2y = 10 \Rightarrow y = 5\).

This process doesn't actually reflect a misconception but rather a correct application of algebra. A common misconception might involve confusing the equation with \(y = mx + c\) form directly or misinterpreting coefficients. However, the straightforward solving here confirms that the value \(5\) is appropriate without invoking a notable algebraic misconception. The calculation directly yields \(5\), supporting option C as a correct calculation rather than a miscalculated one based on a misconception.

The best answer is C.
