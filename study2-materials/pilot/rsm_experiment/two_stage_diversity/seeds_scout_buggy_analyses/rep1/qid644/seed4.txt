## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or buggy procedure that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is the incorrect handling of signs when multiplying two negative numbers. A common error is forgetting that multiplying two negative numbers yields a positive result.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
To multiply the terms indicated by the arrows, the student needs to multiply -1 (from the first bracket) by -4 (from the second bracket). A student with the misconception might think: "-1 times -4 equals -4" because they incorrectly apply the rule for multiplying a negative by a positive (which would yield a negative), rather than remembering that two negatives make a positive.

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the incorrect calculation "-1 * -4 = -4", the student would choose option B: \( -4 \).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive, especially for students who are still solidifying their understanding of integer multiplication rules. The mistake involves a common pitfall where students might forget or misunderstand the rule that two negative numbers multiplied together give a positive number. If a student does not carefully check their work or does not have a strong conceptual understanding of negative number multiplication, they might not realize they went wrong, especially if they are focused on applying a procedure rather than checking the reasonableness of their answer.

The best answer is B.
