## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is the incorrect handling of signs when multiplying two negative numbers. The bug here could be referred to as "negation error" or more specifically, a misunderstanding of the rule that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
A student with the misconception that multiplying two negative numbers results in a negative number (or simply getting the signs wrong) would work through the multiplication of -1 and -4 as follows:
- They would see the terms -1 and -4.
- They would then multiply these two numbers: \(-1 \times -4 = -4\).

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the student's calculation: \(-1 \times -4 = -4\), this directly corresponds to option B: \(-4\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive, especially for students who are still solidifying their understanding of integer multiplication rules. The student might not even realize they went wrong because:
- The mistake involves a fundamental operation (multiplication of negatives) that some students may not have fully grasped.
- The error does not seem to arise from a calculation mistake but from a conceptual misunderstanding, which can be harder for students to detect on their own.

The best answer is B.
