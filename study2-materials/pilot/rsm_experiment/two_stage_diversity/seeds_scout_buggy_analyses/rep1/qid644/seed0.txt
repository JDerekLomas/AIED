## Step 1: Identifying the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is the incorrect handling of signs when multiplying negative numbers. The bug here could be referred to as a "sign error" or more specifically, the misconception that multiplying two negative numbers results in a negative product instead of a positive one.

## 2: Describing how a student with this misconception would work through the question
A student with this misconception would take the two terms indicated by the arrows, -1 and -4, and multiply them. Normally, \( -1 \times -4 = 4 \), because multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result. However, a student with the misconception that multiplying two negatives gives a negative would calculate \( -1 \times -4 = -4 \).

## 3: Identifying which answer option this misconception leads to
Given the calculation \( -1 \times -4 = -4 \), this misconception leads directly to option B: \( -4 \).

## 4: Evaluating how natural or attractive this error is
This error can be quite natural or attractive to some students because it involves a common misunderstanding of the rules of arithmetic operations on negative numbers. Many students struggle with the concept that two negative numbers multiplied together yield a positive result, often finding it counterintuitive. As a result, they might not even realize they went wrong, especially if they are not confident in their understanding of negative number operations or if they do not fully comprehend the distributive property (FOIL method) in the context of multiplying out brackets.

The best answer is B.
