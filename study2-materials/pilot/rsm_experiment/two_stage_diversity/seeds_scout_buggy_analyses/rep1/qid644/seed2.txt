## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error in this context could be the incorrect application of the sign rules when multiplying two negative numbers. A common error is forgetting that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through this question step by step.
A student with the misconception that two negative numbers multiplied together give a negative result would follow these steps:
1. Identify the terms: -1 from the first bracket and -4 from the second bracket.
2. Multiply the numbers: \(-1 \times -4 = -4\).
So, the student would conclude that multiplying the two terms indicated by the arrows gives \(-4\).

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Given the student's calculation: \(-1 \times -4 = -4\), this leads to answer option B: \(-4\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is quite natural and attractive because it stems from a common misconception about negative numbers. Many students initially believe that two negative numbers yield a negative result, mirroring the addition of negative numbers. This misconception can persist because it aligns with an intuitive but incorrect extension of rules for positive numbers. A student holding this misconception might not realize they went wrong until they are explicitly taught or reminded that the product of two negative numbers is positive. The correctness of their procedural steps (multiplying the numbers correctly) but incorrect application of sign rules can make the error less obvious to the student.

The best answer is B.
