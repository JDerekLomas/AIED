## Step 1: Identifying the Misconception
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this scenario is incorrectly adding the whole numbers and the fractions separately without considering the need to find a common denominator for the fractional parts or properly converting mixed numbers to improper fractions for addition.

## 2: Detailed Description of the Misconception
A common misconception among students is to add mixed numbers by simply adding the whole parts and then the fractional parts separately:
- Convert mixed numbers to improper fractions or find a common denominator.
- The correct steps involve:
  1. Convert \(2 \frac{1}{5}\) and \(1 \frac{2}{5}\) to improper fractions: \(\frac{11}{5}\) and \(\frac{7}{5}\).
  2. Add them: \(\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}\).
  3. Convert back to a mixed number: \(3 \frac{3}{5}\).

## 3: Student's Step-by-Step Procedure with Misconception
A student with this misconception might proceed as follows:
1. Add the whole numbers: \(2 + 1 = 3\).
2. Add the fractions: \(\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}\).
3. Combine them: \(3 + \frac{3}{5} = 3\frac{3}{5}\).

## 4: Resulting Answer Option
This student's procedure leads to answer option A: \(3 \frac{3}{5}\), which actually is the correct answer but let's analyze if there's a potential for a different misconception.

## 5: Alternative Misconception Leading to Incorrect Answer
Another misconception could involve adding the denominators and numerators separately or finding an incorrect common denominator. For example, a student might mistakenly convert \(\frac{1}{5}\) and \(\frac{2}{5}\) to have a common denominator of 10: \(\frac{2}{10} + \frac{4}{10} = \frac{6}{10}\) and add the whole numbers: \(2 + 1 = 3\), resulting in \(3\frac{6}{10}\) or simplifying incorrectly.

## 6: Specific Bug Leading to an Incorrect Option
An alternative bug could be not converting the mixed numbers properly or adding incorrectly. For instance, calculating \(2\frac{1}{5} + 1\frac{2}{5}\) as \(2 + 1 + \frac{1}{10}\) (wrongly assuming \(\frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{10}\)) leads to \(3 + \frac{1}{10} = 3\frac{1}{10}\) but a more natural error could result in:
- Incorrectly calculating: \(2\frac{1}{5} = \frac{11}{5}\) and \(1\frac{2}{5} = \frac{7}{5}\), then \(\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5} = 3\frac{3}{5}\) which is correct.

## 7: Less Attractive but Possible Error
If a student mistakes and calculates as \(2.2 + 1.4 = 3.6\), converting 3.6 into a mixed fraction \(3\frac{6}{10} = 3\frac{3}{5}\), still leading to A.

## 8: Final Determination of Misconception and Correction
The error described fits well with simple incorrect handling or no error at all in a straightforward calculation. Given \(2 \frac{1}{5} = \frac{11}{5}\) and \(1  \frac{2}{5}=\frac{7}{5}\), 
\[2 \frac{1}{5}+1 \frac{2}{5} =\frac{11}{5}+\frac{7}{5}= \frac{18}{5}= 3 \frac{3}{5}\]

The best answer is A.
