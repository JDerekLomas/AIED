## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is adding the numerators and denominators separately without finding a common denominator. This can be referred to as the "separate addition" bug.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step
A student with the "separate addition" bug would work through the question as follows:
- Start with the given expression: \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\)
- Add the numerators: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
- Add the denominators: \(2x + x = 3x\)
- Write the result as a single fraction: \(\frac{7}{3x}\)

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to
Based on the steps described, the student's misconception leads to answer option B: \(\frac{7}{3x}\).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is
This error is quite natural and attractive because it involves a straightforward but incorrect application of addition rules. Students might mistakenly apply the rule for adding fractions with the same denominator to fractions with different denominators, or they might simply not recognize the need for a common denominator. The mistake seems logical at first glance because it involves basic arithmetic operations (adding numerators and denominators), making it less obvious that an error has occurred without a correct procedure to compare it to.

The best answer is B.
