## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is adding the fractions by simply adding the numerators and the denominators separately without finding a common denominator. This can be termed as the "naive addition of fractions" bug.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with this misconception would work through the question as follows:
1. Start with the given expression: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \)
2. Add the numerators (3 + 4) and the denominators (2x + x) separately:
   - Numerator: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
   - Denominator: \(2x + x = 3x\)
3. Write the result as a single fraction: \( \frac{7}{3x} \)

## 3: Identify which answer option this misconception leads to.
This misconception leads to answer option B: \( \frac{7}{3x} \).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is quite natural and attractive because it involves a straightforward, but incorrect, application of basic arithmetic operations to fractions. Students might not realize they went wrong because the operation seems so logical (adding parts together), and it does not require an understanding of the need for a common denominator to add fractions properly. The mistake blends in with the correct procedure for adding fractions with the same denominator, making it plausible for students to not catch the error.

The best answer is B.
