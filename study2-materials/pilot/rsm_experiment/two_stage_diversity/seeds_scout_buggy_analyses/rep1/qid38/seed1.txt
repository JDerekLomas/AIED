## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply in this context is adding the numerators and denominators separately when combining fractions, instead of finding a common denominator. This can be referred to as the "separate addition of numerators and denominators" bug.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with this misconception would work through the question as follows:
1. Start with the given expression: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \)
2. Add the numerators (3 + 4) and the denominators (2x + x) separately:
   - Numerators: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
   - Denominators: \(2x + x = 3x\)
3. Combine these to form the new fraction: \( \frac{7}{3x} \)

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
This misconception leads directly to answer option B: \( \frac{7}{3x} \).

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error can be quite natural and attractive to students who are still solidifying their understanding of fraction addition. The mistake involves incorrectly generalizing the rule for adding fractions by adding the parts (numerators and denominators) separately, which might seem logical at first glance but is fundamentally incorrect. Students might not realize they went wrong if they are not thoroughly checking their work against the rules for adding fractions or if they do not have a solid understanding of equivalent fractions and finding common denominators.

The best answer is B.
