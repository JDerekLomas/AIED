## Step 1: Identifying the Misconception
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply is the incorrect application of the order of operations, specifically failing to follow the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule. BIDMAS/BODMAS stands for Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. A common bug is performing operations from left to right without regard to the order of operations.

## 2: Working Through the Question with the Misconception
A student with this misconception might work through the question as follows:
1. Start with the first operation from the left: \(3 - 5 = -2\)
2. Then, perform the next operation: \(-2 + 4 = 2\)
3. Finally, multiply: \(2 \times 2 = 4\)

However, this step incorrectly applies the operations sequentially without adhering to BIDMAS/BODMAS. The correct step should involve multiplying first:
1. \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Then, \(3 - 5 = -2\)
3. Finally, \(-2 + 8 = 6\)

But let's accurately reflect the misconception:
A student incorrectly doing it might actually do:
\(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 = 3 - 5 + 8\) (But if they ignore multiplication and just go left to right or misapply):
\(= 3 - 5 = -2\)
\(= -2 + 4 = 2\) (still, they are not following BIDMAS correctly if they did multiplication at start properly)

## 3: Identifying the Incorrect Answer Option
If a student performs the operations strictly from left to right without following BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly (e.g., \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 = -2 + 4 \times 2\)), and then calculates:
\(-2 + 4 = 2\) and then \(2 \times 2 = 4\), or directly does:
\(3 - 5 = -2\), \(4 \times 2 = 8\), \(-2 + 8 = 6\), actually the misapplication we seek is if one proceeds add then multiply kind.

Suppose going in very naive form; misinterprets as;
$3-5= -2$
add $+4 = 2$;
* then (misinterprets, thinking do mul now), $ 2 \times 2 $ = They got the right.

The best answer is B
