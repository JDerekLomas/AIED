## Step 1: Identify the specific misconception or procedural error.
The specific misconception or procedural error that a UK Year 9 student might apply is the incorrect application of the order of operations, specifically neglecting to follow the BIDMAS/BODMAS order (Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). A common error is performing operations from left to right without considering the priority of multiplication over addition and subtraction.

## 2: Describe how a student with this misconception would work through the question step by step.
A student with this misconception might work through the question as follows:
1. Start with the first operation from the left: $3 - 5 = -2$
2. Then, perform the next operation: $-2 + 4 = 2$
3. Finally, multiply by 2: $2 \times 2 = 4$

## 3: Determine which answer option this misconception leads to.
Following the student's steps: $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$ would incorrectly become $-2 + 4 \times 2 = 2 \times 2 = 4$. Thus, this misconception leads to answer option B) $4$.

## 4: Assess how natural/attractive this error is and whether the student would realize they went wrong.
This error is quite natural and attractive because it involves performing operations in a straightforward, left-to-right manner without properly applying the order of operations. Many students, especially those who are still getting familiar with algebraic expressions, might not realize they are doing something wrong because the steps seem logical and sequential. It might take guidance or feedback to help them recognize the importance of following the BIDMAS/BODMAS rules.

The best answer is B.
