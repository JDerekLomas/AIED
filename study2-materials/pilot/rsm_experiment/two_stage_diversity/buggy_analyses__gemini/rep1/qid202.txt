As an experienced UK maths teacher marking Year 9 mock exams, I have reviewed the five perspectives provided. All perspectives highlight the "Denominator Summation" error (Option D) as a powerful distractor. In a typical Year 9 cohort, the split across ability levels reflects the transition from procedural "rules" to conceptual fluency. 

The inclusion of Option B ($\frac{18}{5}$) is a clever distractor for students who can calculate correctly but fail to read the "mixed number" instruction. Option C targets those who both fail to keep the denominator and ignore the whole numbers.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on common trends in UK Year 9 performance:

below_basic: A=25% B=10% C=20% D=45%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=0% D=10%
advanced: A=92% B=7% C=0% D=1%
