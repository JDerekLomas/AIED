Based on the five perspectives provided, it is clear that **Option A** is the primary "distractor" for Year 9 students. The misconception stems from a "Visual Mimicry" bug where students maintain the $4\pi$ as a numerator and the $3$ as a denominator because that is how the original formula appears. As students move from "Below Basic" to "Advanced," their ability to handle reciprocal operations improves, shifting the frequency from Option A toward the correct Option C.

Here is the predicted distribution of student answers:

below_basic: A=50% B=15% C=5% D=30%
basic: A=55% B=15% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=35% B=10% C=45% D=10%
advanced: A=10% B=5% C=82% D=3%
