As a Year 9 maths teacher, I have reviewed these perspectives and the question: $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$. 

The correct answer is **A** ($\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$). However, the "Add-Across Bug" (Option B) is arguably the most notorious distractor in secondary algebra. Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$) usually stems from students finding the correct common denominator but forgetting to scale the second numerator, or simply adding $3+4$ while keeping $2x$ because it looks "dominant." Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$) is rarer but occurs when students manage to scale the numerators but then "lose" the coefficient in the denominator.

Here is my prediction of the performance distribution across ability levels:

below_basic: A=10% B=65% C=10% D=15%
basic: A=25% B=45% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=65% B=15% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=92% B=3% C=2% D=3%
