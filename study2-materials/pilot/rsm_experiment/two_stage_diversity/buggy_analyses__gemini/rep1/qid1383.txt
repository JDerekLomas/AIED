As an experienced teacher marking these mock exams, I see this specific question as a "filter" for understanding algebraic substitution versus basic arithmetic. The five perspectives provided are unanimous for a reason: the "Negative Base Neglect" (Option C) is one of the most persistent misconceptions in Key Stage 3 and often remains a hurdle well into GCSE.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on the typical Year 9 cohort:

**below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%**
Students at this level often struggle with the definition of indices, frequently confusing $k^4$ with $k \times 4$. The "linear" error ($3 \times 4 = 12$) is the most attractive here. The split between B and D depends on whether they remember to carry the negative sign, but the lack of conceptual understanding of powers makes 12 or -12 the dominant choices.

**basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%**
At the "basic" level, students have learned that $3^4 = 81$. However, their understanding of BIDMAS is fragile and procedural. They are the most likely group to be "trapped" by the calculator logic described in the perspectives. Option C is overwhelmingly attractive here because it feels more sophisticated than multiplying $3 \times 4$.

**proficient: A=45% B=5% C=45% D=5%**
These students know their power tables and understand substitution. This group is essentially split down the middle by the "Invisible Brackets" bug. Half will correctly apply $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$, while the other half will follow the incorrect logic of $-(3^4) = -81$, often feeling confident because their scientific calculator confirmed it.

**advanced: A=90% B=0% C=10% D=0%**
Advanced students generally recognize that an even exponent requires a positive result. The small percentage choosing C usually represents a "slip" where they work too quickly or over-rely on a calculator without sense-checking the sign.

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=45% B=05% C=45% D=05%
advanced: A=90% B=00% C=10% D=00%
