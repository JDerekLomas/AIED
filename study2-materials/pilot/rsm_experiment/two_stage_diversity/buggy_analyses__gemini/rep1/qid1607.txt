As a Year 9 maths teacher, I see these exact misconceptions every time we hit the linear equations unit. 

The student who chooses **C** is typically someone who has a superficial grasp of "moving" numbers but lacks the conceptual foundation of the "balance method." They see Isaac performing a multi-step process and, because his "buggy" logic matches their own internal "procedural sign-switching bug" (adding instead of subtracting), they confirm his answer as correct.

The student who chooses **A** is the "most dangerous" category: they have the technical skill to solve Step 1 correctly, but they are vulnerable to the "Operation Reflection" error in Step 2. They recognise Step 1 is correct but haven't spotted Isaac's mistake in Step 2—unless they are high-attaining enough to actually solve the whole thing themselves first.

Those at the **advanced** level should see through the distractor instantly and pick A, though a small percentage will always rush and fall for the "cleanliness" of Isaac's Step 2.

Here is my prediction for the performance across ability levels:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=10% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=5% D=2%
