In marking these mock exams, it is clear that the "Addition before Subtraction" bug is the dominant pitfall for this specific question. This error is particularly insidious because it often affects students who have put in the effort to memorise the BIDMAS acronym but have not yet grasped the nuances of operator priority.

**Below Basic:** These students often lack a systematic approach. While many will fall for the "A before S" trap (Option D), a significant number will simply work left-to-right from the very beginning, ignoring the priority of multiplication entirely ($3-5 = -2$, $-2+4 = 2$, $2 \times 2 = 4$), leading them to Option B.

**Basic:** This group has the strongest "Literal BIDMAS" tendency. They know they must multiply first, but then they strictly follow the letters A-S. Because they are working harder to "follow the rules," they are the most likely to land confidently on Option D.

**Proficient:** These students generally understand that multiplication comes first. Many have been introduced to the left-to-right rule for addition and subtraction, but under exam pressure, the "A before S" visual lure remains strong. They are more likely than "Basic" students to reach the correct answer (Option A), but the misconception still claims a large portion of them.

**Advanced:** Most students at this level understand that addition and subtraction are inverse operations with equal priority. However, even here, a small percentage may succumb to a momentary "visual clumping" of the $5 + 8$ or a slip in negative number arithmetic.
