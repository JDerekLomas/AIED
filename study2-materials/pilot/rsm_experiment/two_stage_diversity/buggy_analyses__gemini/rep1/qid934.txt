Based on the analysis of common misconceptions for Year 9 students regarding linear equations in implicit form, here is the predicted percentage distribution for each ability level:

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=50% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%

**Reasoning for the distribution:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students are likely to be overwhelmed by the implicit form $4x + 2y = 10$. Many will default to "Ingredient Math" (Perspective 1), performing operations between visible numbers (10 and 4), or "Inverse Confusion" (Perspective 2), resulting in 20. Choice C is slightly higher only because 5 is a "cleaner" number and some may accidentally arrive there via the "Cover-up Method."
*   **Basic:** These students often recognize that $x=0$ simplifies the equation, but they struggle with the two-step manipulation. A significant portion will commit the **Coefficient Neglect** error (Option D: $10 \div 4 = 2.5$) because they have a cognitive bias toward the first coefficient they see. However, the "cleanliness" of $10 \div 2 = 5$ makes Choice C the most popular choice even for those with buggy logic.
*   **Proficient:** These students generally understand substitution and inverse operations. They are likely to correctly isolate $2y = 10$ and solve for $y = 5$. The small percentage choosing D represents those who fall for the visual trap of dividing the constant by the $x$-coefficient under pressure.
*   **Advanced:** These students will identify this as a $y$-intercept problem, substitute $x=0$ mentally or on paper, and accurately divide 10 by 2 with very low risk of procedural error.
