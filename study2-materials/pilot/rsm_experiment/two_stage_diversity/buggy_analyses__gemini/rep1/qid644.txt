Based on the analysis of these perspectives and common patterns in Year 9 mock exams, here is the predicted performance distribution for this question:

**below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=25% D=45%**
Students at this level are highly susceptible to the "Operation-Sign Confusion" (Option D). They often default to addition when they see negative integers. A significant portion will also choose C, performing 1+4 but losing track of the negative signs entirely, or B, simply picking one of the numbers from the expression.

**basic: A=25% B=15% C=10% D=50%**
This is the "danger zone" for the analyzed misconception. These students understand that -1 and -4 are the values to focus on, but the cognitive load of the expansion process causes them to revert to additive arithmetic. They are the most likely to be "tricked" by Option D because it feels like a mathematically sound calculation.

**proficient: A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%**
Proficient students generally remember that expansion requires multiplication. However, a significant minority will still fall into the "Operation Confusion" trap (Option D) under exam pressure, while a few might multiply but fail the "negative x negative = positive" rule (Option B).

**advanced: A=92% B=3% C=0% D=5%**
Advanced students have automated the distributive law. The small percentage missing the mark would likely be due to a "slip" into the additive misconception during a moment of low focus, or a sign error leading to B, but they almost never choose C.
