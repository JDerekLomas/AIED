As a UK maths teacher, I see this exact problem every year in Year 9 mock exams. This question specifically targets the distinction between the "reverse-operations" approach (Tom) and the "clear the denominator" approach (Katie).

The "Incomplete Distribution" bug is a classic middle-attainment trap. Students who are **Basic** or **Proficient** often understand the *logic* of balancing but lack the *procedural fluency* to apply an operation to every term in an expression. They perceive the $-5$ as being physically "outside" the reach of the division. 

While **Advanced** students usually recognise that multiplying by 3 requires distribution ($3 \times 5 = 15$), many still fall into the trap of over-confidence. **Below Basic** students often get overwhelmed by the fraction and gravitate toward Katie's line (Option B) because it makes the equation look "simpler" more quickly, or they pick D because they find algebra inherently confusing.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on typical mock exam performance:

below_basic: A=15% B=40% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=50% B=10% C=35% D=05%
advanced: A=85% B=02% C=12% D=01%
