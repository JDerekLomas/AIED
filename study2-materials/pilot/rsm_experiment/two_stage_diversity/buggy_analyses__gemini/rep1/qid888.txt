As a Year 9 maths teacher, I've seen these patterns play out across hundreds of scripts. Based on the detailed perspectives provided—which correctly identify **Option D** as the most pervasive "quality" distractor—here is the predicted breakdown of student responses.

**below_basic:** A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%
Students in this tier often struggle with the core mechanics. Many will choose **C** because they ignore the negative signs entirely (calculating $5+7$ and $5 \times 7$), or **A** because they perform an accidental subtraction ($7-5$) for the middle term. **D** remains a strong contender even here due to visual pattern matching.

**basic:** A=15% B=20% C=25% D=40%
This is where the "D" misconception is most prevalent. These students have learned the FOIL/grid procedure but lack fluency in directed numbers. They correctly handle the addition for the $-12m$ (middle term), which gives them enough confidence to fall into the "negative $\times$ negative = negative" trap. **C** also remains high as they struggle with sign retention.

**proficient:** A=5% B=55% C=10% D=30%
Proficient students generally understand that $(m-5)(m-7)$ should result in a negative middle term, allowing them to dismiss **C** quickly. However, under the "cognitive heat" described in the perspectives, a significant portion will still default to the sign error in the constant term (**D**), especially if they are working quickly.

**advanced:** A=1% B=92% C=2% D=5%
Advanced students have internalised the sign rules ($ - \times - = + $). Their errors are typically "slips" (careless calculation) rather than entrenched misconceptions. They are most likely to select the correct answer **B**, with the occasional slip leading to **D** if they lose focus on the final step.
