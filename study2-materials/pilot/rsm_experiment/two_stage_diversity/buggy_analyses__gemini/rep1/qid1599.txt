Based on the five perspectives provided, it is clear that Option C is the most "attractive" distractor, rooted in a literal left-to-right translation and a misunderstanding of the vinculum as a grouping symbol. 

Below is the predicted performance across different ability levels for Year 9 students:

**below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%**
Students at this level often struggle with the basic translation of division into fraction form. While many will gravitate towards the linear order of **C**, a significant number will guess **B** (due to over-associating variables) or **D** (misunderstanding which variable is the dividend vs. divisor).

**basic: A=35% B=5% C=55% D=5%**
This group represents the "heart" of the misconceptions described. They know that algebra uses fraction bars instead of $\div$ signs, but they have not yet mastered the idea of the fraction bar acting as a grouping symbol. The left-to-right processing is strongest here, making **C** more popular than the correct answer **A**.

**proficient: A=75% B=2% C=20% D=3%**
Proficient students generally understand BIDMAS and the function of the vinculum. However, under exam pressure, a significant minority will still fall into the "visual mapping" trap of **C**, especially if they are rushing and translating the expression symbol-by-symbol.

**advanced: A=96% B=0% C=3% D=1%**
Advanced students have internalized the fraction bar as a grouping symbol. While a few might make a "slip" (a performance error rather than a conceptual one) and choose **C**, the vast majority will recognize **A** immediately as the correct formal convention.
