Based on the detailed pedagogical analysis of common Year 9 misconceptions—specifically the "Big $\div$ Small" heuristic (Perspective 1, 4, 5) and the "Inverse Over-generalization" leading to multiplication (Perspective 2, 3)—I have predicted the following distribution for the equation $10 = \frac{5}{p}$.

**below_basic:** This group lacks structural algebraic understanding. They are highly susceptible to the "Big $\div$ Small" heuristic (Option C) and often guess "no solution" (Option D) when the numbers don't appear to "fit" a simple multiplication fact in their head.
**basic:** These students have learned the "undo division" rule but apply it indiscriminately. They are the most likely to reach for $10 \times 5 = 50$ (Option B) because they recognise $p$ is involved in a division and believe multiplication is the "correct" algebraic response.
**proficient:** These students generally handle equations well but frequently trip over the "variable in the denominator" trap. The attractiveness of the clean integer $p=2$ (Option C) remains a significant distractor, though about half will correctly perform $10p = 5$.
**advanced:** Most students at this level understand that if $10 = 5/p$, then $p$ must be $0.5$. The few who err usually do so through a momentary "processing bug" or lapse into the $p=2$ misconception by mistake.

below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=45% D=15%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=15% C=28% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=6% D=0%
