Based on my experience marking Year 9 mock exams and the common misconceptions surrounding BIDMAS/BODMAS as detailed in the perspectives, here is the predicted breakdown of student responses.

The key tension in this question is between the "Left-to-Right" rule (the correct way to handle addition and subtraction of equal priority) and the "Strict Hierarchical" reading of the BIDMAS acronym (the misconception leading to Option D). Option B is the mathematically correct answer.

**below_basic:** Students at this level often default to reading a mathematical sentence like a literary one—left to right regardless of operators. They are likely to pick Option A as they ignore multiplication's priority over addition in Problem Q.
**basic:** These students have memorized the BIDMAS acronym but treat it as a rigid vertical list. As discussed in the perspectives, they will correctly identify multiplication first in Q but succumb to the "Addition before Subtraction" bug in P.
**proficient:** These students generally understand operator precedence. Many will get the correct answer (B), but a significant portion will still fall into the "A before S" trap in P because it feels like a "higher-level" rule than simply going left-to-right.
**advanced:** These students have a nuanced understanding of inverse operations and priority "tiers." They recognize that + and - are co-equal and will correctly identify the left-to-right order for Problem P.

below_basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=5% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=0% D=30%
advanced: A=0% B=92% C=0% D=8%
