Based on an analysis of common Year 9 misconceptions regarding BIDMAS and decimal place value in squaring, here is the predicted performance breakdown:

**below_basic: A=35% B=10% C=25% D=30%**
Students at this level often struggle with the order of operations and the concept of a "square." Many will choose C by simply multiplying all the numbers they see ($3 \times 0.3 \times 2 = 1.8$). Others will follow the left-to-right processing seen in Perspective 1 (Option A) or struggle with the decimal placement as seen in Perspective 2 (Option D).

**basic: A=40% B=20% C=5% D=35%**
These students generally understand that $x^2$ means "times itself," which reduces the prevalence of Option C. however, they are highly susceptible to the "Square-All" bug (Option A) due to the proximity of the coefficient, or the "Linear Scaling" error (Option D) because $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ is a very common arithmetic mistake at this level.

**proficient: A=20% B=55% C=0% D=25%**
Proficient students usually respect BIDMAS and avoid Option A. However, the most persistent error here is Perspective 3/4: correctly identifying that they must square $0.3$ first, but incorrectly calculating $0.3^2 = 0.9$ (Option D). They have the algebraic structure right but fail on the decimal arithmetic.

**advanced: A=5% B=90% C=0% D=5%**
Advanced students are expected to recognize the trap of $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$. The small percentage of errors usually comes from rushing or a temporary "mental slip" regarding the order of operations under exam pressure.
