As a UK maths teacher marking these mock exams, I have analyzed the student perspectives and the potential pitfalls of this specific linear equation. 

The question tests two main skills: correct substitution into a non-standard form (where $y$ is the input) and the ability to perform inverse operations with negative coefficients. 

**Option C (3.3)** is the correct answer ($10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$). 

**Option D (2.7)** is the most common distractor for Year 9, representing the "Subtractive Transposition Error" where students subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding. 

**Option A (4.25)** represents the "Variable Swapping Bug," where students substitute 0.5 into $x$, resulting in $5 - 6y = 30$, leading to $25 \div -6$ and a subsequent arithmetic guess or sign error.

**Option B (-4.25)** is a less common variation of the Variable Swap, often chosen by students who correctly identify a negative result but still used the wrong variable.

Based on these patterns, here is the predicted performance breakdown:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=25% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=60% D=30%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=93% D=5%
