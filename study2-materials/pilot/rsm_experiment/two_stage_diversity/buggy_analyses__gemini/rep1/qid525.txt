Based on the five perspectives provided and my experience as a UK maths teacher, here is the predicted performance for a Year 9 cohort on this question.

**Key assumptions in the data:**
*   **Option D** is the most powerful distractor for "Below Basic" and "Basic" students due to the "Add-Across" misconception (Component-wise Addition).
*   **Option B** is the correct answer. 
*   **Option A** is the correct value but expressed as an improper fraction. Students at higher levels might select this if they fail to read the "leave as a mixed number" instruction, though proficient students usually spot this.
*   **Option C** reflects a "common denominator" error where students multiply the denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but fail to adjust the numerators or forget the whole numbers entirely.

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=92% C=1% D=2%
