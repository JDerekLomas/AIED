As a Year 9 maths teacher, I have evaluated this question through the lens of these perspectives. 

The primary challenge here is that **Option A is the correct mathematical answer**. However, as identified in the perspectives, students often arrive at it through a "buggy" logic (the negative reciprocal rule) or fail to arrive at it because they over-correct for the negative sign. 

In Year 9, students are often taught "reciprocals" in the context of both dividing fractions and perpendicular gradients. This creates a collision of rules. 

**Option B** is the strongest distractor for higher-ability students who know the reciprocal is needed to reach "1" but mistakenly think the sign of the multiplier must match the sign of the fraction to "preserve" the negative result (ignoring that negative $\times$ negative = positive). 
**Option C and D** are chosen by students struggling with the concept of a multiplicative inverse entirely, often confusing it with an additive inverse or simply reflecting the original value.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown across ability levels:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=35% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=8% C=1% D=1%
