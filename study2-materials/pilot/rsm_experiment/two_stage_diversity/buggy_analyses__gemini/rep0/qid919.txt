As an experienced teacher marking these mock exams, I have analysed the data and the common pitfalls identified in the perspectives provided. 

The main battleground in this question is between **Option A** (the BIDMAS error of multiplying before squaring) and **Option B** (the correct application of indices to decimals). While **Option D** represents a significant decimal place value error, Year 9 students often struggle more with the "structural" look of $3x^2$ when substituted, leading them to prioritize the coefficient.

Here is my predicted breakdown of student responses:

**below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=20% D=20%**
Students at this level almost universally read the expression left-to-right. The visual "marriage" of the 3 and the 0.3 is too tempting to ignore, leading heavily to Option A. Others may simply multiply all digits ($3 \times 0.3 \times 2$), leading to Option C.

**basic: A=40% B=25% C=10% D=25%**
These students have heard of BIDMAS but often misapply it. Many will fall for the "linearity" of Option D ($0.3^2 = 0.9$, then $0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$), finding it more intuitive than the "smallness" of 0.27. Option A remains a dominant distractor because "3x" is seen as a single unit.

**proficient: A=25% B=55% C=5% D=15%**
Proficient students generally recognize they must square $x$ first. However, a significant portion will still lapse into the "unit" fallacy (Option A) under exam pressure or make the decimal error ($0.3^2 = 0.9$) resulting in Option D. They are beginning to trust that squaring a decimal makes it smaller (B).

**advanced: A=10% B=85% C=0% D=5%**
Advanced students have internalised the priority of indices and are wary of the $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$ decimal trap. The remaining errors are usually "slips" or rare lapses in BIDMAS under the clock.

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=25% B=55% C=05% D=15%
advanced: A=10% B=85% C=00% D=05%
