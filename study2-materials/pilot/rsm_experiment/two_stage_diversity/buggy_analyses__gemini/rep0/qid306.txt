As a UK maths teacher, I have marked thousands of these assessments. The "Addition before Subtraction" trap (BIDMAS hierarchy) is arguably the most resilient misconception we face in Year 9. Even students who can solve complex equations often fall back on the literal letter-order of BIDMAS when faced with a simple string of arithmetic like Problem P.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

*   **Below Basic:** These students often lack a solid grasp of any order of precedence. They frequently work strictly from left to right regardless of the operators involved (leading to Option A) or pick calculations based on numbers they find "easiest" to combine.
*   **Basic:** This is the peak group for the BIDMAS "Rigid Hierarchy" bug. They have memorised the acronym but haven't been taught (or haven't internalised) the concept of equal priority. They will get Problem Q right but apply the same "literal" logic to Problem P, making Option D highly attractive.
*   **Proficient:** These students generally understand that Multiplication beats Addition, but many still wobble on the Addition vs Subtraction left-to-right rule under exam pressure. You see a split here between the correct Option B and the common error Option D.
*   **Advanced:** These students recognise the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction and understand they occupy the same tier of priority. They should overwhelmingly choose Option B, though a small percentage might still fall for the linguistic trap if working too quickly.

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=25% C=5% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=2% D=33%
advanced: A=1% B=92% C=0% D=7%
