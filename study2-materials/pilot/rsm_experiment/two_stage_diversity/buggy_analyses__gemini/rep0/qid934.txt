Based on my experience marking Year 9 mock exams and the common algebraic misconceptions outlined, here is the predicted breakdown of student responses. 

**Option C (5)** is the correct answer. 
**Option B (3)** is the most common "procedural" distractor, often stemming from treating $4x$ as $4+x$.
**Option D (2.5)** captures those who divide the constant (10) by the wrong coefficient (4) or invert their division.
**Option A (20)** represents students with significant foundational gaps who perform multiplication instead of division.

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=45% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=15% C=65% D=15%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
