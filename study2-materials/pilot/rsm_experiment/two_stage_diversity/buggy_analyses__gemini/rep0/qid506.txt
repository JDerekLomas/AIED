Based on the analysis of these common misconceptions and my experience with Year 9 mock exams, here is the predicted percentage distribution for each ability level:

**below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%**
Students at this level are heavily driven by "number bonds" and visual cues. Seeing 3 and 12 immediately triggers the quotient 4. Many will pick **C** because they prefer whole numbers, while others will pick **A** because they recognise the answer should probably remain a fraction. **D** attracts those who simply subtract the coefficients ($12-3=9$).

**basic: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%**
At this level, students know they must "divide by 3" but lack the fractional fluency to execute it. Option **A** is the dominant distractor because it feels mathematically "clean" and logical to divide the denominator by the coefficient. The "Keep-Change-Flip" rule is often forgotten or misapplied here.

**proficient: A=35% B=55% C=5% D=5%**
These students understand the algebraic steps required but are still prone to the "procedural bug" described in Perspectives 1, 2, 3, and 5. While over half will correctly multiply the denominator to get $1/36$, a significant portion will still fall into the trap of "simplifying" 12 and 3 to get 4, leading them to **A**.

**advanced: A=5% B=92% C=1% D=2%**
Advanced students generally recognise that dividing a fraction by a whole number involves multiplying the denominator. The few errors here are usually due to "exam fog" or rushing, occasionally leading to **A** via the same "compatible numbers" reflex, or **D** through a momentary calculation lapse.
