Based on the analysis of these perspectives and common pedagogical trends in Year 9 mock exams, here is the predicted percentage distribution for each ability level.

**below_basic**: A=30% B=10% C=25% D=35%
*Students at this level often struggle with the distributive law itself (FOIL), leading to "inner/outer" subtraction errors (Option A) or total sign confusion (Option C). Option D is highly attractive as it preserves the signs seen in the question.*

**basic**: A=15% B=20% C=15% D=50%
*This is the peak of the Option D misconception. These students have mastered the procedure of FOIL and correctly add $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$, but almost universally default to the "negative plus negative stays negative" rule for the constant term.*

**proficient**: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%
*Proficient students have a solid grasp of algebra. However, under exam pressure and "cognitive load" (as noted in Perspective 5), a significant minority will still commit the sign error in the final term.*

**advanced**: A=1% B=92% C=1% D=6%
*Advanced students are fluent with directed numbers and the expansion of quadratics. The small percentage choosing Option D would be due to "slippage" or clerical errors rather than a fundamental misunderstanding.*
