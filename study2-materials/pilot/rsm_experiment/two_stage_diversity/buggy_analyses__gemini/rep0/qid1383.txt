Based on the detailed pedagogical perspectives provided, it is clear that the interaction between negative substitution and index notation is a significant "bottleneck" concept for Year 9 students.

The primary distractor here is **Option C**, fueled by the "Sticky Negative" misconception and reinforced by incorrect calculator input. **Option D** is the most common error for students struggling with the definition of exponents themselves.

Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mock exam:

**below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%**
*At this level, students frequently confuse exponentiation with multiplication ($k \times 4$), leading them to Option D. They are less likely to grasp the magnitude of $3^4$ correctly.*

**basic: A=15% B=10% C=50% D=25%**
*These students often recognize $3^4$ as 81, but they are most susceptible to the "Negative Base Neglect" described in Perspective 1 and 2. They will likely type `-3^4` into a calculator or mentally "attach" the sign at the end.*

**proficient: A=40% B=5% C=45% D=10%**
*Proficient students know $3^4=81$, but many still fall into the "Bracket Trap." This is a peak area for Option C, where the student follows BIDMAS/BODMAS too literally (Indices before Subtraction) without realizing substitution requires brackets.*

**advanced: A=85% B=0% C=15% D=0%**
*Advanced students are generally aware of the need for brackets $(-3)^4$ and that even powers yield positive results. However, a small percentage may still succumb to a "slip" or trust a calculator output without double-checking the sign logic.*
