As a Year 9 teacher marking these mocks, it's clear that the "Add Across" error (Option B) is the most pervasive "buggy procedure" we see. It persists because it feels algebraically consistent ($2x + x = 3x$) even though it violates the laws of fractions. 

Option D is also a common pitfall for those who *start* to find a common denominator but forget to multiply the numerator by the same factor (the "half-baked" method). Option C usually indicates a student who found the correct numerator but then tried to "simplify" $2x$ down to $x$ or simply ignored the coefficient.

Here is the predicted distribution based on typical Year 9 mock exam performance across the UK:

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=45% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=65% B=15% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=92% B=3% C=2% D=3%
