Based on an analysis of common Year 9 pedagogical data and the misconceptions identified (Variable Swapping, Inverse Operation Bug, and Sign Detachment), here is the predicted performance distribution:

**below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%**
Students at this level are highly susceptible to "Variable Swapping" (Perspective 1 and 2). They often substitute $0.5$ for $x$ and then struggle with the negative coefficient of $y$. Many will choose A or B because the resulting calculation (around 4.16) "looks like" 4.25, or they make a guess based on the magnitude of the numbers.

**basic: A=15% B=10% C=30% D=45%**
These students generally understand substitution but are the most likely to fall for the "Inverse Operation Bug" (Perspective 3, 4, and 5). They correctly calculate $10x - 3 = 30$ but then perform $30 - 3$ to get $2.7$. This "clean" decimal gives them false confidence, making Option D the most attractive distractor.

**proficient: A=5% B=5% C=75% D=15%**
Proficient students have likely mastered the inverse operation $(+3)$ but may still make a "slippage" error under exam pressure, leading to D. However, the majority will correctly navigate the two-step equation to arrive at 3.3.

**advanced: A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%**
Advanced students will immediately recognize the structure of the equation and the requirement to solve for $x$ when $y$ is given. Errors at this level are rare and usually limited to clerical mistakes rather than conceptual misconceptions.

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=30% D=45%
proficient: A=05% B=05% C=75% D=15%
advanced: A=01% B=01% C=96% D=02%
