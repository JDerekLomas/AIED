Based on the analysis of the common misconceptions regarding reciprocals and directed numbers in Year 9 students, here is the predicted percentage distribution for each ability level:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=55% B=20% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=35% B=55% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=10% B=88% C=1% D=1%

**Explanation of the trends:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the concept of a reciprocal entirely. They are more likely to choose **C** or **D** because they don't understand that the fraction must "flip" to reach 1; they simply see the numbers already present in the question and replicate them.
*   **Basic:** This group is the most susceptible to the misconceptions described in the perspectives. They have learned the "flip" rule for reciprocals but have not mastered the multiplicative identity for directed numbers. They overwhelmingly choose **Option A** because they feel the need to "change" or "opposite" the sign as part of the inverse process, or to "keep the answer negative" via $(- \times + = -)$.
*   **Proficient:** These students have a strong grasp of reciprocals but often fall into the "Symmetry" trap or the "Preservation of Negative Identity" (Perspective 3). While more will get it right (Option B), a significant portion will still choose **Option A** due to the cognitive load of handling both the fraction and the sign simultaneously under exam pressure.
*   **Advanced:** Most will correctly identify **Option B** through substitution or formal algebraic manipulation. Those who err will likely do so via a "slip" rather than a deep-seated misconception, usually defaulting to the positive reciprocal out of haste.
