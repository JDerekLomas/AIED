As a teacher marking these mocks, I’ve seen these exact thought processes play out countless times. Students at this level often treat algebra as "moving pieces" on a board rather than applying inverse operations to maintain equality. 

The allure of Option A cannot be overstated—it preserves the "visual geography" of the original formula, keeping the 4 "on top" and the 3 "on the bottom." For students who lack the confidence to flip a fraction, it feels like the safest, most "formulaic" choice. Option B is a common middle-ground error for students who know $\pi$ must be divided but still can't bring themselves to invert the $4/3$, while Option D attracts those who forget that the cube root must apply to the entire expression.

Based on these common Year 9 misconceptions, here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=50% B=15% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=25% B=15% C=55% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=2% C=92% D=1%
