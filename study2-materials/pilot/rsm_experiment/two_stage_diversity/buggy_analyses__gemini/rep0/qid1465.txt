Based on the analysis of these common misconceptions—specifically the "Strict Linear Processing" (Perspective 2 & 5) and the "Literal BIDMAS A-before-S" bug (Perspective 1, 3, & 4)—here is the predicted distribution of answers for Year 9 students.

**below_basic:** A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
*At this level, students almost exclusively use the "Typewriter" method (B), reading left-to-right. Option C is more common here as a result of miscalculating the negative in a linear fashion or random guessing.*

**basic:** A=30% B=30% C=5% D=35%
*Students here are aware of BIDMAS but fall heavily into the "A before S" trap (D). The attractiveness of -10 is highest at this level. They are starting to move away from linear processing (B) but still lack fluency with directed numbers.*

**proficient:** A=65% B=10% C=0% D=25%
*Proficient students correctly prioritise multiplication. However, the "A before S" literal interpretation remains a "sticky" misconception that even capable students default to when working quickly or failing to treat the minus sign as a negative property of the 5.*

**advanced:** A=92% B=3% C=0% D=5%
*Advanced students recognise the equal priority of Addition and Subtraction. The few errors here are usually due to "examination slip" (simple arithmetic errors) or a momentary lapse back into the literal BIDMAS acronym.*
