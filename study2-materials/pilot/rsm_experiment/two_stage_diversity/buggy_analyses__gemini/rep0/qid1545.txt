Based on the detailed analysis of the "Left-to-Right" misconception and typical performance data for Year 9 students in the UK, here is the predicted percentage distribution for each ability level:

**below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%**
Students at this level almost exclusively use linear processing. They treat the expression as a story, reading left-to-right. Because $8+12$ neatly equals $20$ and $20 \div 4$ neatly equals $5$, the "clean" result reinforces their confidence in Option C. Brackets are viewed as decorative.

**basic: A=30% B=15% C=50% D=5%**
These students have heard of BIDMAS but apply it inconsistently. While some will identify that division comes first, a significant portion will still fall into the "Left-to-Right" trap because the visual symmetry of the numbers on both sides of the box suggests equality.

**proficient: A=65% B=5% C=28% D=2%**
Proficient students generally follow the order of operations. However, a notable minority will still make a "lapses in concentration" error, performing the addition first on the left side because it is the first operation they see, leading them to Option C.

**advanced: A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%**
Advanced students have internalised the priority of operations and are less likely to be swayed by the visual "cleanliness" of the incorrect linear path. They will correctly calculate $11 > 5$. The few errors here are usually due to arithmetic slips or extreme over-thinking.

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=05%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=50% D=05%
proficient: A=65% B=05% C=28% D=02%
advanced: A=92% B=02% C=05% D=01%
