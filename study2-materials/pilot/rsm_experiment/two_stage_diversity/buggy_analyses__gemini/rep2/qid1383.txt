Based on the analysis of these common misconceptions—specifically the "Unary Minus" bug (Option C) and the "Base times Index" bug (Option D)—here is the predicted distribution of responses for UK Year 9 students:

**below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=30% D=35%**
*At this level, students frequently confuse powers with multiplication. Option D is highly attractive as it is a quick, one-step calculation. Option B is chosen by those who also struggle with negative number laws. Only a small percentage will correctly calculate $3^4$.*

**basic: A=20% B=10% C=45% D=25%**
*These students are beginning to master the arithmetic of powers ($3^4 = 81$) but are highly susceptible to the "calculator logic" error. Option C becomes the dominant distractor here because the students feel successful having calculated 81, yet they fail to handle the negative base correctly.*

**proficient: A=45% B=5% C=45% D=5%**
*Proficient students almost all know that $3^4 = 81$. The "battle" here is entirely between the correct application of even powers (Option A) and the systematic error of failing to bracket the substitution (Option C). This is the level where the error is most "sticky" because it feels mathematically sophisticated.*

**advanced: A=85% B=0% C=15% D=0%**
*Advanced students have been explicitly coached on the "Substitution uses Brackets" rule. While the vast majority will identify that an even power results in a positive value, a small percentage may still fall into the "calculator trap" if they are working too quickly or relying on intuition rather than formal notation.*
