As an experienced teacher, I have reviewed the student perspectives provided. This specific question is fascinating because **Option A is the mathematically correct answer**, yet it is also the result of several common procedural "bugs." 

Many students at the lower ability levels will choose **A** because they "match" the single negative sign in the question to the single negative sign in the result, rather than understanding the property of the multiplicative inverse. Students at the "Proficient" level often overthink the sign rules, occasionally selecting **B** because they are so used to "two negatives making a plus" that they assume a product involving a $-1$ must have come from two negatives. 

"Below Basic" students often ignore the fraction operation entirely and look for a number that "looks like" the target, leading to high selections of C and D.

Here is the predicted distribution of answers based on Year 9 mock exam trends:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=25% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
