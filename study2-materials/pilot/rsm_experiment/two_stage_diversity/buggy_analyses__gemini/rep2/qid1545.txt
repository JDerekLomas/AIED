As an experienced teacher, I have marked thousands of these types of "priority of operations" questions. This specific problem is a classic "distractor" because the incorrect method (left-to-right) yields a neat, whole-number result ($5$), which acts as a powerful confirmation bias for students who haven't yet mastered the structural hierarchy of mathematics.

While Year 9s have seen BIDMAS/BODMAS for years, under the pressure of a mock exam, many revert to "linear processing." The "Advanced" students will spot the division first, "Proficient" students will likely get it right but may pause, while "Basic" and "Below Basic" students will almost certainly fall into the "equal to" trap because it feels instinctively consistent.

Here is my prediction of the performance data across the cohorts:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=10% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=28% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%
