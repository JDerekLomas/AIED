As an experienced examiner, I have reviewed the misconceptions presented. This question is a classic "subject of a formula" problem that tests not only the recall of the sphere volume formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) but also the algebraic fluency required to manipulate it. 

Year 9 students frequently struggle with the "inverse" of fractional coefficients. The "Visual Mimicry" and "Reciprocal Misplacement" identified in the perspectives are extremely common; many students believe that "rearranging" simply involves moving symbols to the other side of the equals sign without flipping their orientation. 

Option C is the correct answer. Option A and B are the strongest distractors due to the fractional inversion errors, while Option D captures students who lack the conceptual understanding of how the cube root applies to the entire expression or who try to "pull" the root out of the fraction prematurely.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on typical Year 9 mock exam performance in the UK:

below_basic: A=35% B=30% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=30% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=20% B=20% C=50% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=88% D=2%
