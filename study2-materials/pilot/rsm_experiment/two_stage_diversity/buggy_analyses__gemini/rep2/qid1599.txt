Based on the detailed pedagogical analysis of Year 9 misconceptions regarding the vinculum as a grouping symbol, here is the predicted performance breakdown:

**below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%**
At this level, students struggle with both the "division as a fraction" convention and the order of operations. Option C is highly attractive due to left-to-right processing. Option D (reversing the divisor and dividend) and Option B (over-generalising where variables belong) are also common "blind guesses."

**basic: A=35% B=5% C=50% D=10%**
These students have learned that division should look like a fraction, which eliminates Option B. However, as noted in the perspectives, the "Floating Constant" bug (Option C) is at its peak here. They likely view the fraction bar as a direct replacement for the $\div$ symbol but lack the structural understanding to extend it under the $+4$.

**proficient: A=70% B=2% C=25% D=3%**
Proficient students generally recognise the vinculum's role as a grouping symbol. However, under exam pressure, "Linear Processing" errors still persist. About a quarter of these students will fall into the trap of "dealing with" the division first and appending the constant afterwards, especially if they are moving quickly through the paper.

**advanced: A=94% B=1% C=4% D=1%**
Advanced students have mastered the "visual grammar" of algebra. They understand that parentheses are redundant in fraction form because the bar implies the grouping. Errors here are rare and usually down to clerical slips (misreading the symbols) rather than structural misconceptions.

basic: A=35% B=05% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=02% C=25% D=03%
