As a Year 9 maths teacher, I have seen these exact patterns play out in countless mock exams. The "Selective Term Multiplication" (or Partial Distribution) is one of the most stubborn misconceptions we face. 

Students at the lower end of the spectrum often prioritise "getting rid" of fractions above all else, making Katie's approach look incredibly modern and "efficient" to them. As students move up in ability, they become more comfortable with adding/subtracting before multiplying, which is why Tom's (correct) approach gains traction. However, even "Proficient" students often get caught in the trap of thinking Katie has found a clever shortcut, failing to see the distributive error. Only "Advanced" students typically have the structural awareness to recognise that multiplying the equation by 3 requires scaling every term, not just the fraction.

Here is my prediction of the results across the different ability levels:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=38% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%
