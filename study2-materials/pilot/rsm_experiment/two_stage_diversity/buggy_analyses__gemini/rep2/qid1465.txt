Based on the analysis of these common misconceptions—particularly the "Serial Processing" (Left-to-Right) error leading to Option B and the "Rigid BIDMAS" (Addition-before-Subtraction) error leading to Option D—here is the predicted performance breakdown for Year 9 students:

**below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=5% D=35%**
Students at this level are highly likely to process the expression linearly (Option B) as it is the lowest cognitive load. Those who do remember the BIDMAS acronym often apply it too rigidly (Option D), while very few correctly navigate both the order of operations and the directed number arithmetic.

**basic: A=30% B=20% C=5% D=45%**
At the "basic" level, students have been drilled in BIDMAS and are less likely to work strictly left-to-right. However, this often leads them directly into the "A-before-S" trap. Option D becomes the most attractive distractor here because it feels like the result of a "correct" application of the rule.

**proficient: A=65% B=5% C=0% D=30%**
Proficient students generally recognize that multiplication comes first. The remaining 30% largely represents the "hidden bug" mentioned in Perspectives 1, 2, 4, and 5—even capable students often miss the nuanced rule that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority.

**advanced: A=92% B=0% C=0% D=8%**
Advanced students usually understand that Addition and Subtraction are inverse operations with equal priority. However, under the pressure of a mock exam, a small margin of these students will still fall back on the literal mnemonic (Option D) through over-reliance on heuristics rather than conceptual understanding.

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=5% D=35%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=5% D=45%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=0% D=30%
advanced: A=92% B=0% C=0% D=8%
