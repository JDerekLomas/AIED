Based on the detailed pedagogical analysis provided and common trends observed in UK Year 9 mock examinations, here is the predicted percentage breakdown of student responses by ability level.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **Option C ($p=2$):** This is the most common misconception. It appeals to students' "integer bias" and the "large $\div$ small" heuristic. It dominates the "Basic" and "Below Basic" categories.
*   **Option B ($p=50$):** This represents a "misapplied inverse" (multiplying instead of dividing). It is highly attractive to students who remember that fractions involve division and that multiplication is the opposite, but who lack the structural understanding of the variable as a denominator.
*   **Option A ($p=0.5$):** The correct answer requires two steps ($10p = 5$, then $p = 5/10$) or the understanding of swapping the divisor and the quotient.
*   **Option D:** Usually a "guess" for students who feel 5 cannot be divided to result in 10.

below_basic: A=05% B=30% C=55% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=25% C=55% D=05%
proficient: A=50% B=15% C=33% D=02%
advanced: A=92% B=03% C=05% D=00%
