Based on the analysis of these Year 9 student perspectives and common misconceptions regarding linear equations and negative coefficients, here is the predicted percentage distribution for each ability level:

**below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=25% D=30%**
Students at this level are highly susceptible to "Variable Misassignment" (Perspective 2 and 5), often leading them to choices A or B because they perform a reflexive substitution for $x$ rather than $y$. They also struggle with basic arithmetic and negative signs. Choice D is very attractive due to "Leftover Logic" ($30-3$), and Choice C is often a guess based on the numbers appearing in the question.

**basic: A=10% B=15% C=35% D=40%**
At the basic level, students are more likely to correctly substitute $y=0.5$ but succumb to the "Inverse Operation Order Error" (Perspective 1 and 4). D is the primary distractor here because the $10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 27$ logic feels more intuitive than the addition required to reach C. They rarely check their answers by substituting back into the equation.

**proficient: A=5% B=5% C=75% D=15%**
Proficient students generally understand that $y=0.5$ must be substituted. While some will still make the sign error leading to D, the majority will correctly identify that they need to "add 3" to the other side ($10x = 33$). This is a standard two-step equation for this level, and $3.3$ is a very "clean" and reassuring result for a Year 9 student.

**advanced: A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%**
Advanced students will accurately perform the substitution and the two-step rearrangement. They are less likely to be swayed by "Clean Number" bias or sign reversal errors. The small percentage of errors would likely stem from rare lapses in concentration (rushing) or simple calculation slips.
