As a UK maths teacher marking these Year 9 mocks, I have reviewed the student logic provided. The core of this question lies in whether students recognise the denominator as a 'label' or 'size' (which remains constant) versus an independent integer to be operated upon.

While **A** is the correct mixed number, **B** is the correct improper fraction (and therefore mathematically equivalent, though the question asks for a mixed number). **C** represents a mix of the "denominator addition" bug and the conversion to improper fractions, while **D** is the classic misconception identified across all five perspectives.

Here is the predicted performance distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=5% C=15% D=65%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=5% D=45%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=0% D=10%
advanced: A=92% B=8% C=0% D=0%
