Based on the analysis of these common Year 9 misconceptions, here is the predicted percentage breakdown of student responses. 

**below_basic**: This group often struggles with fractions. Many will not recognise that multiplying by 4 is the correct first step, leading to high figures for "Both steps are incorrect." However, many will see the $+1$ and $61$ and select "Both steps are correct" based on simple arithmetic intuition.
**basic**: This group usually manages the first step but is the "prime" category for the inverse operation sign error identified in the perspectives. Because they perform the same error as Isaac, a significant portion will believe both steps are correct.
**proficient**: These students are more likely to identify Step 1 as correct but have the algebraic fluency to spot the "change side, change sign" error in Step 2. They will largely select Option A.
**advanced**: These students should have high accuracy, recognising the arithmetic check $15.5 \neq 15$. Occasional "silly errors" in speed may lead to some choosing Option C, but the majority will correctly identify that only Step 1 is valid.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=5% D=2%
