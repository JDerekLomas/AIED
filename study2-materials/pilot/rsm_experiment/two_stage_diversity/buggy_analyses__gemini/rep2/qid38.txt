Based on the detailed pedagogical analysis of common Year 9 misconceptions, here is the predicted percentage distribution for the multiple-choice question:

**below_basic: A=10% B=70% C=5% D=15%**
Students at this level almost universally apply the "Add Everything" rule described in the perspectives. B is the overwhelmingly "logical" choice for them because it requires simple addition ($3+4$) and basic collecting of like terms ($2x+x$). D is a secondary distractor for those who add the top but get confused by the denominator.

**basic: A=35% B=45% C=5% D=15%**
These students have a lingering "Add Everything" bug (B), but many are starting to remember they need a common denominator. However, they often fail the execution—for instance, changing the second denominator to $2x$ but forgetting to multiply the numerator by 2 ($3/2x + 4/2x = 7/2x$), leading to D, or correctly identifying $2x$ but making a calculation error, leading to A.

**proficient: A=75% B=10% C=5% D=10%**
At this level, the "Add Everything" bug (B) is largely conquered. These students know they need to find a common denominator of $2x$ and correctly scale the second fraction to $8/2x$. Most will arrive at the correct answer (A). Errors here are usually due to "silly" arithmetic mistakes rather than conceptual failure.

**advanced: A=95% B=1% C=2% D=2%**
Advanced students recognize this as a routine procedural task. They instinctively see the relationship between $x$ and $2x$ and perform the mental calculation $(3+8)/2x$. The very small percentage of incorrect answers would be due to clerical slips or misreading the question.
