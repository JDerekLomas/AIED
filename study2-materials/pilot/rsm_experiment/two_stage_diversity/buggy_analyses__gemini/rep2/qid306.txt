As a Year 9 maths teacher, I see these patterns every year. The "BIDMAS" acronym is a powerful tool but creates a "priority trap" for addition and subtraction. While top-set (advanced) students have usually grasped the left-to-right associativity of equal-priority operations, middle and lower-ability students are often led astray by the very mnemonic intended to help them.

Here is my prediction for the percentage breakdown across ability levels:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=55% C=5% D=35%
advanced: A=0% B=92% C=0% D=8%

**Teacher’s Notes on the Data:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often lack a firm grasp of the BIDMAS acronym entirely. They frequently default to a "Left-to-Right" reading for everything (leading to Option A) or pick calculations randomly based on which numbers look "easier" to pair up.
*   **Basic:** This is the peak for **Option D**. These students have worked hard to memorise BIDMAS but treat it as a rigid, linear 1-6 list. Because 'M' is before 'A', and 'A' is before 'S', Option D feels like the "correct" disciplined application of the rule.
*   **Proficient:** These students generally recognise that Multiplication has priority (ruling out A and C), but many still fall for the "Addition before Subtraction" trap (Perspective 1–5). The 55% in Option B reflects those who have mastered the "equal priority" rule.
*   **Advanced:** The majority will correctly identify Option B. The small 8% error rate for Option D usually stems from over-thinking or "autopilot" errors where they revert to the literal order of the acronym under the pressure of a mock exam environment.
