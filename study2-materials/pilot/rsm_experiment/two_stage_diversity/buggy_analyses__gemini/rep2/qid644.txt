As an experienced examiner marking Year 9 scripts, I have reviewed these perspectives. The "Additive Bug" (choosing D) is indeed a classic Year 9 pitfall. It thrives because students often confuse the 'middle' step of expanding a quadratic (where they add terms to simplify) with the 'end' step of multiplying the constants.

Students at the **below_basic** level often struggle with the "double negative" rule and the operator itself, often just picking a number they see (like 4). **Basic** students are the "sweet spot" for the identified misconception; they know how to work with negative numbers but revert to addition under the cognitive load of algebra. **Proficient** students usually remember to multiply but occasionally trip up on the sign, while **Advanced** students have usually automated the $a \times b$ rule for binomials.

Here is the predicted distribution based on these common classroom behaviours:

below_basic: A=20% B=35% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=20% D=55%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=10% D=20%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=3% D=3%
