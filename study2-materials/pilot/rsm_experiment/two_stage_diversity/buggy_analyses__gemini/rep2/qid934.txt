As an experienced teacher, I have marked thousands of these papers. This specific question is a "trap" question because the most common "lazy" logic (dividing the constant by the coefficient of the variable they see) actually leads to the correct answer for Option C.

Here is the predicted distribution of answers based on Year 9 mock exam data:

**Below Basic**
Students at this level often struggle with algebraic substitution entirely. They are highly likely to guess or use "number salad" logic—multiplying all visible numbers ($4 \times 5$ or $2 \times 10$) leading to Option A. They also often struggle with the concept of $0$ in an equation, sometimes treating it as if it "adds nothing" to the coefficient rather than nullifying the term.
*   **below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%**

**Basic**
These students generally understand that $x=0$ means "the $x$ part goes away." However, they lack confidence in formal rearrangement. Many will choose C (the correct answer) via the flawed logic identified in Perspective 1: "Just divide 10 by 2." However, a significant portion will fall for the "Intercept Confusion" (Perspective 5) and calculate $10 \div 4 = 2.5$, assuming that’s the procedure for "the start of the table."
*   **basic: A=15% B=10% C=45% D=30%**

**Proficient**
Proficient students can substitute $0$ into $4x + 2y = 10$ and reach $2y = 10$. The majority will correctly identify this as $y=5$. The main distractor for this group is D (2.5), caused by either a variable swap (Perspective 5) or a temporary lapse in concentration where they solve for the $x$-intercept instead of the $y$-value.
*   **proficient: A=5% B=5% C=70% D=20%**

**Advanced**
Advanced students will immediately recognize this as finding the $y$-intercept of a linear graph in implicit form. They will substitute $x=0$ mentally or on paper and solve $2y=10$ with very high accuracy. Occasional slips to D occur only under time pressure.
*   **advanced: A=1% B=1% C=93% D=5%**
