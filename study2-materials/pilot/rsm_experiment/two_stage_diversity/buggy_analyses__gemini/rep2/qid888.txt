As a UK maths teacher marking these Year 9 mocks, I have reviewed the student data and the five perspectives on the "Negative Integer Product Bug." 

Year 9 is a pivotal year where students transition from simple FOIL procedures to more complex signed-number work. Option D is indeed the "star distractor." Students who choose D often understand the quadratic structure but have not yet internalised the distinction between additive and multiplicative rules for directed numbers. Option A represents students with "summing errors" (e.g., $-7 + 5$), while Option C represents a total disregard for the negative signs within the brackets.

Based on typical UK Year 9 performance data for a question of this difficulty, here is the predicted percentage distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=10% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=15% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=1% D=7%
