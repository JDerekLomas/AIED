Based on the analysis of these common misconceptions in UK Year 9 cohorts, here is the predicted percentage distribution for each ability level:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=25% B=45% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=0% D=5%

**Rationale:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with index notation entirely, making **Option C** (multiplying $0.3 \times 2$ and then by $3$) the most common "escape" route.
*   **Basic:** At this level, students generally remember that $x^2$ involves multiplication but are highly susceptible to order of operations (BIDMAS) errors (**Option A**) or decimal placement errors (**Option D**). They often feel "safe" because their calculated answers appear on the list.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually know BIDMAS and the definition of a square number, but the "Linear Place Value Decay" described in Perspective 4 remains a very strong distractor. Many will correctly identify that they need to do $3 \times 0.09$, but a significant portion will still lapse into $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ or $0.9^2 = 0.81$.
*   **Advanced:** Most students at this level have mastered decimal multiplication or instinctively convert to fractions ($\frac{3}{10} \to \frac{9}{100}$) to verify their sense of scale, leading to a high success rate for **Option B**.
