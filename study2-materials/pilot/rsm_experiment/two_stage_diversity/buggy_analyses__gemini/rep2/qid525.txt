Based on the five perspectives provided and my experience as a UK maths teacher, here is the predicted performance for Year 9 students.

The analysis consistently highlights **Option D** as the "Add-Across" misconception. This is the most common error for students who lack conceptual understanding of denominators. **Option B** is the correct answer. **Option A** is a mathematically equivalent improper fraction ($ \frac{99}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$), which may attract more capable students who fail to follow the "Leave your answer as a mixed number" instruction. **Option C** represents a partial attempt at a common denominator where the denominators were multiplied ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but the numerators were added without being scaled.
