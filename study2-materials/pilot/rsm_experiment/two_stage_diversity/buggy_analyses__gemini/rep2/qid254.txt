As an experienced Year 9 teacher, I see this specific question as a "trap" regarding the conceptual nature of zero in statistics. While Option A is mathematically correct ($0+1+3+4+7$ is equivalent to $1+3+4+7$), students across different ability levels will fall for the "Zero-as-Nothing" misconception or Order of Operations (BIDMAS) errors.

Here is my prediction of the performance data based on typical UK Year 9 mock exam results:

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=35% D=5%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=10% C=30% D=5%
advanced: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%

**Analysis of the Data:**

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the horizontal representation of division. They are highly likely to pick **Option B** because it mirrors how they would type it into a non-scientific calculator, failing to realise that without brackets, only the 7 is being divided by 5.
*   **Basic:** This group is the most susceptible to the **Option C** trap. They understand that "the mean is the sum divided by the count," but their conceptual understanding of zero is weak. They see zero as a "null" entry and believe dividing by 4 is a more "accurate" representation of the "active" data.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually recognize the divisor must be 5 because there are five items in the list. However, a significant portion will still choose **Option C** because they overthink the numerator, or they may find Option A "incomplete" because the zero is missing from the sum (even though the sum is mathematically identical).
*   **Advanced:** Most of these students will recognize that adding zero changes nothing in the numerator, making **Option A** the only logically sound choice, despite the "missing" zero. Only a small percentage might over-analyse the question and choose D if they are looking for a literal $0+1+3+4+7$ string.
