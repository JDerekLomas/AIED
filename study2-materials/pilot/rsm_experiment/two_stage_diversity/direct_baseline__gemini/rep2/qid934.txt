In this Year 9 mock, students find this question deceptively difficult because the equation is in the implicit form ($ax + by = c$) rather than the explicit $y = mx + c$. 

**Breakdown of the errors:**
*   **C (5)** is the most common error for **Basic** students. They substitute $x=0$, see $4(0) + 2y = 10$, and correctly solve $2y=10$. However, many just look at the $10$ and the coefficient $2$ and divide, or they assume $4x$ is $0$ and then see $2 \times ? = 10$. It is the "correct" wrong answer.
*   **B (3)** is the most common error for **Proficient** students who attempt to find the pattern in the table without calculating $x=0$ first. They often assume the gradient is $-1$ or $1$ based on the coefficients $4$ and $2$, or they incorrectly rearrange to $y = -2x + 5$ and then make a slip.
*   **A (20)** is the "Below Basic" trap. These students see the numbers $2, 10$ and $0$ and simply multiply $2 \times 10$. Or, they misinterpret $2y=10$ and multiply by 2 instead of dividing.
*   **D (2.5)** comes from students who divide the wrong way ($10 \div 4$) because they see the $4$ first in the equation.
