In my experience marking this specific order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) question, the primary pitfall is the "Left-to-Right" trap. Students who lack a firm grasp of operation hierarchy naturally want to sum 8 and 12 first on the left side, which leads them to see both sides as identical.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **The "Equality" Trap (C):** Students at the lower end see $(8+12)$ on both sides and simply ignore the placement of brackets or the hierarchy of division, concluding $20 \div 4 = 20 \div 4$.
*   **The "Greater Than" Calculation (A):** This is the correct path. $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$, whereas $(8+12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$. Since $11 > 5$, A is correct.
*   **The "Comparison" Error (B):** This is rarer but occurs when students calculate correctly but get the symbol direction confused—a common issue in "Below Basic" papers.
*   **The "Placeholder" Guess (D):** Usually chosen by students who see a "complex" looking symbol and assume it must be the answer because the question looks "tricky."

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on a typical Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=60% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=10% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=20% D=0%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
