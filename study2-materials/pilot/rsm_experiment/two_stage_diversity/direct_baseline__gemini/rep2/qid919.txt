To predict these results, I have analysed the following common pitfalls:

*   **Option A (0.81):** This comes from the "power muddle" where students calculate $(3x)^2$ instead of $3x^2$. They multiply 3 by 0.3 to get 0.9, then square it. This is very attractive to students who ignore BIDMAS/BODMAS.
*   **Option C (1.8):** This is the classic "multiplication instead of indices" error. The student calculates $3 \times 0.3 \times 2$. This is common for students who lack confidence with powers.
*   **Option D (2.7):** A simple place value error where the student squares 0.3 to get 0.9 (forgetting $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$) and then multiplies by 3.
*   **Option B (0.27):** The correct answer ($0.09 \times 3$).
