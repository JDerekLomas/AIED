To arrive at these predictions, I’ve considered the following common Year 9 pitfalls:
*   **The "Add Across" Trap (D):** This is the classic error for lower-ability students. They add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and then simply add the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$). It feels "natural" and is a very common plateau for students who haven't mastered common denominators.
*   **The Improper Fraction Conversion (A):** Many students are taught that converting to improper fractions is the "safest" way to avoid errors. However, many will do the hard work ($\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$), find the correct value, but fail to read the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
*   **The Common Denominator Error (C):** Students often multiply the two denominators to find a common one ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but then fail to adjust the numerators correctly, or they might calculate the correct improper fraction ($\frac{99}{20}$) but then accidentally double the denominator to 40 when trying to "simplify" or find an equivalent fraction.
*   **The Mixed Number Method (B):** This requires finding the LCM (20), converting parts ($4 \frac{14}{20} + 4 \frac{5}{20}$), and summing. This is where the proficient and advanced students land.

Here are the predicted percentages:

basic: A=25% B=30% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
