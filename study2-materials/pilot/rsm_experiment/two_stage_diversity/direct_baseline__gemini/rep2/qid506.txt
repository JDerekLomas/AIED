Having just sat at my kitchen table for twelve hours marking two hundred of these, this question is a classic "separator." It looks deceptively simple, but the fraction on the right-hand side triggers what I call "operational confusion."

Here is the breakdown of how the Year 9s typically perform on this:

**The Thought Process:**
*   **A ($p=1/4$):** This is the most common error. Students see '3' and '12' and their brains jump to division: $12 \div 3 = 4$. They then instinctively place it back into a fraction. 
*   **B ($p=1/36$):** The correct answer. Requires the student to realize that to undo "multiply by 3," they must multiply the denominator by 3 (effectively dividing the whole fraction by 3).
*   **C ($p=4$):** The result of "cleaning up" the fraction too early. Students multiply 3 and 12 rather than dividing, or simply do $12 \div 3$ and ignore the fractional reciprocal.
*   **D ($p=1/9$):** A rarer mistake, usually from students who subtract 3 from 12 incorrectly or square the 3 for no apparent reason.

**The Predictions:**

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=55% B=25% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=97% C=1% D=0%
