In my experience marking this specific question, it serves as a classic "trap" for students who rely on intuitive number patterns rather than formal algebraic manipulation. 

The most common error is seeing the numbers 10 and 5 and reflexively performing $10 \div 5$ to get 2 (Option C). This feels "right" because 10 is the larger number. Another group of students will attempt to move the $p$ by multiplying, but mistakenly multiply the 10 and the 5 to get 50 (Option B). Only students who can navigate the two-step process of $10p = 5$ followed by $p = 5/10$ successfully reach 0.5 (Option A).

**Breakdown of errors:**
*   **Option C ($p=2$):** The "intuitive" trap. Students see 10 and 5 and perform the simplest division available. Very attractive to basic and below-basic students.
*   **Option B ($p=50$):** A misunderstanding of inverse operations. Students know they need to "undo" the division but multiply the constants together instead of rearranging the variable correctly.
*   **Option D:** Often a "panic" choice for students who cannot remember how to solve for a denominator.

below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=50% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=10% C=23% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=3% D=0%
