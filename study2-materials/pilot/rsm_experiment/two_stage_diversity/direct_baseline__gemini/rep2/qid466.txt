To predict the performance of Year 9 students on this question, we must consider the specific pitfalls of fraction arithmetic and directed numbers.

**Thinking Process:**
*   **The Trap (A):** This is the most "attractive" wrong answer. Students recognize that a reciprocal is needed to reach the number 1, but they often forget that "a negative times a negative makes a positive." They see the $-1$ in the question and choose the positive $\frac{4}{3}$ because they haven't internalised that $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1$.
*   **The "Same Number" Error (D):** Below-basic students often see a "1" and assume the number must stay the same, or they confuse the identity property of multiplication (multiplying by 1) with the target result.
*   **The Additive Inverse (C):** Students who confuse multiplication rules with addition rules often think the signs just need to "cancel out" or look for the positive version of the fraction provided.
*   **The Correct Answer (B):** This requires two distinct steps: knowing that the product of reciprocals is 1, and knowing that two negatives are required to result in a positive... wait.
*   **Correction on Logic:** The question asks for $-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$.
    *   To get a **negative** result, the signs must be **different**. 
    *   Since the first fraction is negative, the second must be **positive**.
    *   Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.

**Revised Student Thinking:**
*   **The Trap (B):** This is the most common error for proficient students. They know the reciprocal rule perfectly ($\frac{3}{4} \rightarrow \frac{4}{3}$) and they have the "two negatives make a positive" rule so firmly drilled into them that they apply it reflexively, even though the target here is a negative result.
*   **The Correct Answer (A):** Requires the student to realize that because the product is already negative, the multiplier must be positive. Advanced students catch this; basic/proficient students often "over-solve" and add a second negative.
