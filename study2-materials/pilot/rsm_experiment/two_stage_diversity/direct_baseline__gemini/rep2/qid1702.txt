To predict these results, I have analysed the common misconceptions associated with rearranging linear equations and negative numbers for Year 9 students:

*   **Option C (3.3):** This is the most common "calculation slip." Students calculate $10x = 30 + 3$ (from $6 \times 0.5$) to get $10x = 33$. However, they forget to divide by 10 properly or make a decimal placement error, though usually, they arrive at 3.3 by correctly doing $33 \div 10$. It is very attractive because it yields a "clean" decimal.
*   **Option D (2.7):** The "Sign Error Trap." Students subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it (doing $10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 27$). This is the most common conceptual error for mid-level students who struggle with isolating terms.
*   **Option B (-4.25):** The "Substitution Swapsies." Students put the $0.5$ in the $x$ position instead of the $y$ position: $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30 \rightarrow -6y = 25 \rightarrow y = -4.16$ (often rounded or miscalculated to 4.25).
*   **Option A (4.25):** Similar to B, but losing the negative sign during the division of $-6$.
