In this Year 9 cohort, the primary "trap" is the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students often process calculations strictly from left to right, ignoring that multiplication takes priority. The second major hurdle is directed numbers—specifically, the transition from $3-5$ to $-2$, where many students mistakenly reach $2$ or fail to handle the sign correctly when combining terms.

Here are the common errors:
- **Option A (6):** The correct answer ($3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = 6$). Requires understanding BIDMAS and negative numbers.
- **Option B (4):** Left-to-right calculation error ($3 - 5 = -2$; $-2 + 4 = 2$; $2 \times 2 = 4$). This is the most common error for middle-ability students.
- **Option C (-12):** A calculation error following a BIDMAS fail ($3 - 5 + 4 = 2$ or $-2$; then mistakenly interpreting signs or addition: $(3 - (5+4)) \times 2 \rightarrow -6 \times 2 = -12$). 
- **Option D (-10):** Another variation of left-to-right processing, often involving a sign error in the subtraction phase ($3-5$ seen as $5-3$, then making the result negative later).
