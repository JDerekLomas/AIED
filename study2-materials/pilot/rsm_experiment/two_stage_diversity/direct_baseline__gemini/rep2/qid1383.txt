In my experience marking this specific topic with Year 9 students, the difficulty lies entirely in the interaction between negative bases and even exponents, and the confusion between indices and multiplication.

**Thinking Process:**
*   **The Index Error ($3 \times 4 = 12$):** Lower ability students often default to multiplication when they see small superscripts. They ignore the negative sign entirely (B) or carry it over (D).
*   **The Negative Power Trap ($ -3^4 = -81$):** This is the most common error for middle-to-high ability students. Many students believe that because the base is negative, the answer must stay negative. Furthermore, many students use a scientific calculator without brackets (typing $-3^4$), which gives $-81$, leading them to trust the incorrect result.
*   **The Correct Calculation ($(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$):** Only students who have internalized that an even power of a negative number results in a positive value—or those who are extremely careful with bracket notation—get this right.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown for each ability level:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
