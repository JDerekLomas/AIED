Having marked 200 of these scripts, this question highlights the common "barrier" between those who follow rules and those who understand denominators. Even for a simple addition with the same denominator, students in Year 9 often overcomplicate the process or fall into the "add everything" trap.

**Breakdown of the responses:**
*   **A (Correct):** Adding the integers (2+1) and the numerators (1+2).
*   **B (Misreading):** Converting to an improper fraction correctly but failing to follow the "leave as a mixed number" instruction.
*   **C (Worst Case):** Adding both the numerators and the denominators and treating the whole numbers as fractions ($11/5$ + $7/5$ $\rightarrow$ $18/10$).
*   **D (The Denominator Trap):** Adding the whole numbers and the numerators correctly, but mistakenly adding the denominators (5+5=10).

**below_basic:** These students lack confidence in fraction laws and tend to "add all the numbers" they see. D is extremely attractive to them because $5+5=10$ feels intuitively correct in a way that $5$ remaining $5$ does not.
**basic:** These students know they need to add the parts, but frequently fall for the "add the denominators" trap or, interestingly, convert everything to improper fractions and then fail to convert back (B).
**proficient:** Most will get the right answer, but about 10-15% will lose a mark by converting to $18/5$ and forgetting to turn it back into a mixed number as per the rubric.
**advanced:** Should be near 100%, with only a rare "silly" slip where they add the denominators by accident.

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=25% D=35%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=80% B=12% C=3% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
