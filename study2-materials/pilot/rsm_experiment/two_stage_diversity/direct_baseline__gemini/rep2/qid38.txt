To solve $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator. The most direct method is to multiply $\frac{4}{x}$ by $\frac{2}{2}$ to get $\frac{8}{2x}$, then add: $\frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$ (Option A).

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** The classic "add across" error (3+4 and 2x+x). This is highly attractive to lower-ability students who treat algebraic fractions like simple strings of numbers.
*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** A partial process error where the student recognizes the common denominator is $2x$, but forgets to multiply the numerator of the second fraction by 2 (calculating $3+4$ instead of $3+8$).
*   **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** A rare error where the student finds the correct numerator but forgets how denominators function in addition, or performs an incorrect "simplification" by removing the 2.

**Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** Almost all will "add across" (B).
*   **Basic:** Will know they need a common denominator, but many will fail to adjust the numerator (D) or still revert to adding across.
*   **Proficient:** Most will reach the correct answer (A), but a significant minority will make the "numerator neglect" error (D) under exam pressure.
*   **Advanced:** Should find this trivial, with errors only occurring due to extreme haste.
