In this question, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4). Step 2 is incorrect; the student should have subtracted 1 from 60 to get 59, but instead, they added 1. This "inverse operation" error is a classic misconception at Year 9.

**Analysis of Errors:**
- **Step 1:** Most students recognise the need to "undo" the division. Only the weakest students will struggle here, perhaps trying to subtract 4 or divide 15 by 4.
- **Step 2 (The Trap):** This is the high-discrimination step. Students see $+1$ and instinctively feel it should "combine" with 60. Many students don't look closely at the sign or the balancing process and assume that if Step 1 is right, Step 2 must naturally follow. 
- **Option C (The Distractor):** This is the most "attractive" wrong answer. Students often "glance-solve" and see numbers that look right ($60$ and $61$ are next to each other), leading to a high percentage of "Both correct" among Basic and Proficient learners.
- **Option A (The Correct Answer):** Requires the student to carefully check the subtraction in Step 2.
