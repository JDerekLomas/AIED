In my experience marking this specific question, students struggle significantly with the "multi-step" nature of the rearrangement. Even though Year 9s are taught the volume of a sphere formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$), the algebraic manipulation required to isolate $r$ provides several traps:

*   **Option A** is the result of "multiplying by the top" and "dividing by the bottom"—a common confusion when dealing with fractions. Students see $4/3$ and mistakenly think they need to multiply $V$ by 4 and $\pi$ together.
*   **Option B** is for students who correctly divide by $\pi$ but fail to handle the $4/3$ fraction properly, simply moving the $4/3$ to the other side as it appears.
*   **Option C** is the correct rearrangement.
*   **Option D** is a classic "visual" error where students cube root the $V$ but apply the $3/4\pi$ as a linear multiplier outside the radical, or fail to understand that the cube root applies to the entire term.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=35% B=30% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=65% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=93% D=2%
