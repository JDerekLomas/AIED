In this Year 9 mock, students frequently trip up on the distinction between adding and multiplying directed numbers. The "sum vs product" confusion is the primary driver for errors here.

*   **Error for B (-4):** This is the "sign blindness" error. Students know $1 \times 4 = 4$ but fail to apply the rule that a negative times a negative equals a positive.
*   **Error for C (+5):** This is the most common conceptual error. Students see the instruction to "combine" the terms and perform $-1 - 4$ or $|-1| + |-4|$, incorrectly adding instead of multiplying.
*   **Error for D (-5):** This is the "directed number addition" error. Students add $-1$ and $-4$ to get $-5$, forgetting the instruction that expanding brackets involves multiplication.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
