In marking 200 of these Year 9 papers, the primary "deciding factor" for this specific question is the mastery of negative number arithmetic rather than the algebraic expansion (FOIL/Grid method) itself.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **B (Correct):** Requires two correct steps: $-5 + -7 = -12$ and $-5 \times -7 = +35$.
*   **A:** The "Difference" error. Students subtract 5 from 7 to get 2, or incorrectly combine $-7$ and $-5$ by treating them like $7 - 5$. This is common for students who rush.
*   **D:** The "Signs" trap. Students correctly add 5 and 7 to get 12, but forget that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive. This is the most "attractive" distractor because the final sign is often the last thing they write and the least checked.
*   **C:** The "Positive" bias. Students ignore the minus signs entirely, treating the question as $(m+5)(m+7)$. This is seen in students who have memorised the pattern but struggle with integers.

**Predicted Distributions:**

**below_basic:** A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
*(At this level, it is often a coin-flip. Many will ignore the signs entirely (C) or guess based on the numbers appearing in the question.)*

**basic:** A=15% B=40% C=15% D=30%
*(These students usually know to add for the middle and multiply for the end, but "negative times negative equals positive" is a rule they frequently forget under exam pressure, leading them to D.)*

**proficient:** A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
*(Most have mastered the grid/FOIL method. Errors here are usually "slip-ups" regarding the final sign (D) or a mental arithmetic error (A).)*

**advanced:** A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%
*(Advanced Year 9s see this as a 'standard' 1-mark question and will automatically check their signs as they go. Only a rare 'copying error' would lead to a wrong choice.)*
