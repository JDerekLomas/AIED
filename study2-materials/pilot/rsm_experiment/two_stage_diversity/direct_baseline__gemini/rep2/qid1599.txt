To predict these results, I’ve considered the following common Year 9 misconceptions:
*   **The "Left-to-Right" Trap (Option C):** Many weaker students view algebra as a sequence of buttons on a calculator. They see $c \div h$ first, write $\frac{c}{h}$, and then simply append the $+4$ at the end, failing to recognise the brackets as a grouping symbol for the denominator.
*   **The "Reciprocal Error" (Option D):** Students who have recently covered dividing fractions often reflexively "flip" the second term, but accidentally swap the positions of the numerator and denominator in their final answer.
*   **The "Random Variable Insertion" (Option B):** Very low-ability students often "balance" expressions visually; seeing a 4 on one side makes them feel there should be a 4 on the other.
*   **Brackets as "Invisible" (Option A):** Only proficient and advanced students consistently recognise that a fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol, removing the need for explicit parentheses.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on a typical 200-paper sample:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=55% B=5% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=8% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
