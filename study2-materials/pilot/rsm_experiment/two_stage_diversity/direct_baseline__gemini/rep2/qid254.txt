Having marked 200 of these scripts, this question is a classic "trap" that identifies exactly who understands the role of zero in data and who understands BIDMAS/order of operations.

**Teacher's Notes on the distractors:**
*   **Option A** is the correct answer. The numerator is the sum (the 0 adds nothing) and the denominator is the count of items (5).
*   **Option B** is a massive BIDMAS trap. Students writing this on a calculator without brackets or a fraction bar will get $0+1+3+4+(7 \div 5) = 9.4$. This is a very "attractive" error for students who know the steps but lack mathematical rigor.
*   **Option C** is for those who think "zero doesn't count" and divide by 4. This is the most common conceptual error.
*   **Option D** is for the over-thinkers who see Option A missing the "0+" and decide it must be incomplete, or those who realize Option B is missing brackets.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=15% B=40% C=40% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=30% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=1% D=5%
