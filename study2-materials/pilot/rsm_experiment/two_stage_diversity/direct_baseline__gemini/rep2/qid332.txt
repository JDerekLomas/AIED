In this Year 9 mock, this question specifically tests "order of operations in reverse" (solving linear equations). The trap is Katie’s method: students who rely on a memorised rule of "getting rid of the fraction first" often forget to multiply *every* term by the denominator, making Katie's error the most common "proficient-level" mistake.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **Tom's method** is the standard "balance" approach (adding 5 to both sides). Most students find this intuitive.
*   **Katie's method** is a classic error. She multiplied the first term and the result by 3, but failed to multiply the -5. Students often see $x-5=36$ and think it "looks" like a valid step because they performed the multiplication on the 12.
*   **Below Basic** students often guess or see "two people talking" and assume one must be right and one wrong, or they struggle with the fraction entirely.
*   **Basic** students recognize Tom's $+5$ as correct but are easily seduced by Katie's logic because "doing the same to both sides" (the 12 and the $x/3$) feels correct even if they miss the middle term.
*   **Proficient** students usually identify Tom is right but are the most likely to fall for Katie’s trap (C) because they have been taught to "clear the fraction" but haven't mastered the distributive property over the whole side of an equation.
*   **Advanced** students recognise that for Katie to be correct, the equation would have to be $\frac{x-5}{3} = 12$, and they spot the missing $-15$.
