Here is the predicted breakdown based on common misconceptions seen in Year 9 mock papers, specifically regarding BIDMAS/BODMAS.

**Teacher's Notes on Common Errors:**
*   **The "Addition over Subtraction" Trap:** Many students (especially at 'basic' and 'proficient' levels) have been taught BIDMAS so rigidly they believe the 'A' (Addition) *must* always come before 'S' (Subtraction). This leads them to believe $5+6$ must be done first in Problem P.
*   **The Left-to-Right Instinct:** Most students naturally work left-to-right unless a multiplication or division sign acts as a "speed bump" (as in Problem Q).
*   **The Distractor:** Option D is the "hyper-correction" trap where students over-apply the priority of operations to Problem P.

basic: A=10% B=25% C=25% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
