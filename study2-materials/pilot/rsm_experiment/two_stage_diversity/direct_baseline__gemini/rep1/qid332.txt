To predict these results, I’ve considered the common Year 9 misconceptions regarding the order of operations in inverse calculations.

**Tom's method** involves adding 5 to both sides first. This is the standard "reverse BODMAS" approach taught in most UK classrooms. It is the most "natural" first step for most students.
**Katie's method** involves multiplying by 3 first. However, she has failed to multiply the $-5$ by $3$. This is the classic "distributive error" where students only multiply the fraction and the right-hand side, forgetting the independent constant.

*   **Below Basic** students often guess or pick "Both" because they assume any move that removes a number is valid.
*   **Basic** students usually recognise Tom's step as "the way teacher does it" but get confused by Katie's, often thinking multiplying by 3 must be okay since there is a 3 on the bottom.
*   **Proficient** students are confident with Tom's addition but frequently fall into Katie’s trap, failing to realise that *every* term must be multiplied by 3.
*   **Advanced** students recognise that while you *can* multiply by 3 first, Katie has done it incorrectly (it should be $x - 15 = 36$), thus they correctly identify Only Tom.
