In my experience marking this specific type of question for Year 9, students find implicit linear equations ($ax + by = c$) significantly more difficult than the standard $y = mx + c$ format. 

The common pitfalls are:
- **Option A (20):** Students multiply $4 \times 10$ or $2 \times 10$ in a confused attempt to rearrange.
- **Option C (5):** The "Attractive Trap." Students correctly identify $x=0$, but then look only at $2y=10$. They divide 10 by 2 but often skip the "check" or assume the $4x$ isn't part of the calculation for the intercept. This is the most common answer for middle-ability students who have a partial understanding of substitution.
- **Option D (2.5):** Students divide 10 by 4, confusing the coefficients of $x$ and $y$.
- **Option B (3):** This is the "calculator-less" guess or a result of trying to solve $4(1) + 2y = 10$ and putting that value in the first box by mistake.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on a typical Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=8% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=5% D=93%
