Having just sat at my desk marking 200 of these, I can tell you that "fraction fatigue" is real for Year 9s. Even the bright ones often see the numbers 3 and 12 and their brains immediately scream "4!" without checking the operation.

Here is the breakdown of the errors I've encountered:
*   **A ($p = 1/4$):** The most common mistake. Students see $3$ and $12$ and perform $12 \div 3$, but keep the fraction structure. They essentially solve $3p = 12$ and then stick a "1 over it" or simply multiply $1/12$ by 3 instead of dividing.
*   **B ($p = 1/36$):** The correct answer. Requires understanding that dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying the denominator by 3.
*   **C ($p = 4$):** The "ignore the fraction" approach. These students solve $12 \div 3$ and completely discard the fact that the 12 was in the denominator.
*   **D ($p = 1/9$):** A "squared" confusion or simple mental arithmetic slip where students think $3 \times 3 = 12$ or similar.
