Having marked hundreds of these papers, here is the breakdown of how Year 9 students typically approach this question.

**The "Thinking" behind the marks:**
*   **A is the correct answer.** Most students find adding mixed numbers with common denominators intuitive (add the wholes, add the parts).
*   **B is the "Instruction Ignorer."** This is the mathematically correct value but converted to an improper fraction. Many proficient students do this out of habit from harder fraction work, missing the "Leave as a mixed number" instruction.
*   **D is the "Common Denominator Trap."** This is the most "attractive" error. Students see an addition sign and feel they *must* add everything, including the denominators ($5+5=10$). This is incredibly common in basic-level sets.
*   **C is the "Total Collapse."** This is usually "Below Basic" students who add all four numbers as if they were numerators and denominators ($2+1+1+2=6$ / $5+5=10$, or some variation of cross-multiplying gone wrong).

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=25% D=35%
basic: A=55% B=15% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=4% C=0% D=0%
