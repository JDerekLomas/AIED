Having marked 200 of these scripts, I can tell you that the presence of the number zero is the single biggest "distractor" for Year 9. 

Students often struggle with the conceptual role of zero; many see it as "nothing," leading them to believe it shouldn't be counted in the divisor (Option C). Others correctly identify that it must be included in the divisor but assume the addition of zero is mathematically redundant in the numerator, making Option A look highly attractive. Option B is the classic "calculator error" where students forget BIDMAS/order of operations—a very common sight in lower-set papers.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

**below_basic:** A=25% B=45% C=25% D=5%
*(Lower-attaining students often choose B because they write it exactly as they would type it into a basic calculator. Those who remember "the mean involves a fraction" are split between ignoring the zero entirely (C) or just the addition of it (A).)*

**basic:** A=40% B=20% C=35% D=5%
*(Students here know to divide by 5, but many see Option A as a "simplified" version of the correct sum. There is a strong pull toward Option C from students who think the zero doesn't "count" towards an average.)*

**proficient:** A=60% B=5% C=15% D=20%
*(These students understand BIDMAS, so they avoid B. They know to divide by 5, but many believe Option A is mathematically equivalent and "correct enough" because $0$ doesn't change the sum. Only the sharper students in this bracket realize that A is actually correct and D is a trap.)*

**advanced:** A=85% B=0% C=5% D=10%
*(Top-tier students recognize that $0+1+3+4+7$ is identical to $1+3+4+7$. However, about 10% will overthink it, searching for a "perfect" representation that includes the $+0$, and choose D because they think A is a trick.)*
