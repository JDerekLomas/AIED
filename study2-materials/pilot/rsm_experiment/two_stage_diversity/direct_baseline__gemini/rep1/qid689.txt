In my experience marking this specific type of question, the most common pitfall is the "commutative trap." Students often see the numbers 10 and 5 and intuitively perform $10 \div 5$ regardless of the algebraic structure, making $p=2$ the strongest distractor.

**The Logic of the Errors:**
*   **$p=0.5$ (Correct):** Requires two steps (multiplying by $p$ then dividing by 10) or recognizing that $5 \div 0.5 = 10$.
*   **$p=50$:** A common error where students think "I need to get $p$ on its own" and mistakenly multiply 10 by 5.
*   **$p=2$:** The most common "gut instinct" error. Students see $10$, $5$, and $p$ and assume $p = 10 \div 5$. It feels mathematically natural even though it violates the balancing rules.
*   **No solutions:** Often chosen by students who are confused by a smaller number being divided by an unknown to get a larger number.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=10% B=35% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=10% C=23% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
