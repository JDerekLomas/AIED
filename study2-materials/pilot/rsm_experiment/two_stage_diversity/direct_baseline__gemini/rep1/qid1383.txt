Having marked hundreds of these scripts, this specific question is a classic "sign error" trap. Even at Year 9, the distinction between $(-3)^4$ and $-3^4$ is one of the most persistent misconceptions.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **B and D (12 and -12):** These are the "multiplication instead of exponent" errors ($3 \times 4$). This is the hallmark of students who are still struggling with the basic notation of indices.
*   **C (-81):** This is the most "attractive" wrong answer. Students correctly identify that $3^4 = 81$, but they believe a negative base must result in a negative product, or they are subconsciously following the rule "if there's a minus in the question, there's a minus in the answer."
*   **A (81):** The correct answer. Students must know that an even power of a negative number is positive.

**Predicting the Spread:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will jump to $3 \times 4$ because they find indices intimidating.
*   **Basic:** They know indices mean repeated multiplication, but almost all will miss the sign rule, making C the most popular choice here.
*   **Proficient:** These students know $3^4 = 81$ and are starting to remember the even/odd power rule, but under exam pressure, many still fall for the "negative stays negative" trap.
*   **Advanced:** Most will get this right, though a small percentage will make a "silly error" by working too quickly.
