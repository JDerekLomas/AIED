In this Year 9 mock, students find the rearrangement of the sphere volume formula notoriously difficult. The primary challenge is not just recalling $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, but the algebraic manipulation of the fraction.

**A (Common mistake):** Students often multiply by the numerator and divide by the denominator (associating "top" with "more"), resulting in $4V/3$. This is a very common algebraic slip for those who don't write out the step-by-step balancing.
**B (The 'almost' there):** Students remember to divide by $\pi$ but still flip the fraction incorrectly.
**C (Correct):** To solve $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, you multiply by $3$ ($3V = 4\pi r^3$), divide by $4\pi$, and then take the cube root.
**D (The 'non-algebraic' guess):** Students see the cube root is necessary but fail to understand that it must apply to the entire expression, or they attempt to move terms outside the radical incorrectly.

Here is the predicted distribution based on marking 200 Year 9 scripts:

below_basic: A=35% B=30% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=15% C=65% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=95% D=0%
