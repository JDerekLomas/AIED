In this question, the common pitfall is the transition from Step 1 to Step 2. While Isaac correctly identifies that he needs to multiply by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$), he fails at the additive inverse step. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$, he adds 1 to 60.

This is a classic "sign error" or "inverse operation error." Students at lower levels often see the $+1$ and instinctively want to add, or they simply perform $60 + 1$ because it feels like a "neater" progression than subtraction. 

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

**below_basic:** A=15% B=15% C=55% D=15%
*(At this level, many students see the "61" and "60" and assume the arithmetic is correct without checking the inverse operation. Option C is the most attractive trap.)*

**basic:** A=25% B=10% C=60% D=5%
*(Basic students often recognise Step 1 is correct, which makes them trust Step 2 more. They are highly susceptible to the "doing the same thing to both sides" error where they add when they should subtract.)*

**proficient:** A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
*(Proficient students usually spot the mistake in Step 2. They know $60-1=59$, and thus correctly identify that only Step 1 holds water.)*

**advanced:** A=94% B=1% C=3% D=2%
*(Advanced students will perform a quick mental check ($59+1=60$) and immediately discard Step 2. Only a few will make a "silly" reading error.)*

below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=55% D=15%
basic: A=25% B=10% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=3% D=2%
