After marking 200 of these Year 9 scripts, the trends are clear. The primary battleground is **BIDMAS/BODMAS** versus **Left-to-Right** processing.

The calculation breaks down as follows:
*   **Left Side (LHS):** $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$.
*   **Right Side (RHS):** $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$.
*   **Correct Comparison:** $11 > 5$.

**The Pitfalls:**
*   **The "Left-to-Right" Trap:** Lower-ability students often ignore order of operations on the LHS, calculating $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$. This leads them to $5 \square 5$, making Option C ($=$) an incredibly "attractive" distractor.
*   **Visual Similarity:** Students see the same numbers and operators and instinctively guess $C$ or $D$ without calculating, assuming brackets don't change the value.
*   **Inequality Confusion:** Even some students who calculate $11$ and $5$ correctly might mix up the $>$ and $<$ symbols, though this is less common by Year 9.

Here is the predicted distribution based on standard UK mock data:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=10% D=0%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
