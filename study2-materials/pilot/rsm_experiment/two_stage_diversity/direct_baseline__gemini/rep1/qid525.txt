To arrive at these predictions, I’ve considered the following common Year 9 pitfalls:
*   **The "Add Across" Trap (Option D):** Adding the numerators ($7+1$) and denominators ($10+4$) is the classic error for students who lack a conceptual understanding of common denominators. This is highly attractive to below-basic students.
*   **The Improper Fraction Pitfall (Option A):** Many students correctly convert to $\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4}$, find the common denominator of $20$, and get $\frac{54+45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$. However, many fail to read the final instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
*   **The Denominator Confusion (Option C):** This occurs when a student multiplies the two denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but either forgets to scale the numerators correctly or simply uses the incorrect common denominator logic with the total sum from Option A.
*   **The Mastery Level (Option B):** This requires handling the integers separately ($2+2=4$) and then finding the common denominator for the fractions ($\frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20}$). Advanced students do this instinctively, while proficient students may occasionally forget to simplify or convert back.

Here are the predicted percentages based on a typical 200-paper sample:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
