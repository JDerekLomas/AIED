In this question, students must navigate two distinct concepts: the **reciprocal** (the multiplicative inverse) and the **sign rules** for multiplying negative numbers. 

**Diagnostic thinking:**
*   **The Trap (A):** This is the most "attractive" distractor. Students know they need to "flip" the fraction to get a product of 1, but they often forget that a negative times a positive stays negative. They associate "reciprocal" purely with the inversion of the digits.
*   **The Conceptual Error (C):** Common among lower-attaining students who believe that to get to -1, you just need to "cancel out" the fraction by adding its positive counterpart, or who confuse multiplication with addition rules.
*   **The Misunderstanding (D):** Usually chosen by students who think any number multiplied by itself results in 1 (confusing squaring with inverses).
*   **The Success (B):** Requires the student to realize that to get a *positive* 1 (the coefficient hidden in the result), you need two negatives. 

Here are the predicted percentages based on a typical Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=35% B=55% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
