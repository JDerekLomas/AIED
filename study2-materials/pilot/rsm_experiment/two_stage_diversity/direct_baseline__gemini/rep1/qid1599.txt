In marking this question across a cohort of 200 Year 9 students, I am looking for their understanding of horizontal division notation being equivalent to the vinculum (fraction bar). 

The primary "trap" for lower-ability students is Option C, where they fail to see the brackets as a grouping mechanism and simply divide the first two terms. Option D is the classic "reversal" error, often seen in students who understand that division becomes a fraction but forget that the divisor must be the denominator. Option B is a "noise" distractor that attracts students who are guessing based on seeing similar terms.

**Error Analysis:**
*   **A (Correct):** Recognises the fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol replacing the brackets.
*   **B (Nonsense):** Attracts students who think the $+4$ must be applied to both parts of the fraction or are simply overwhelmed by the notation.
*   **C (BIDMAS Error):** The most common mistake. Students ignore the brackets or process from left to right: $c \div h$ then $+4$.
*   **D (Inverse Error):** Students who know "it becomes a fraction" but place the dividend on the bottom.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=2% C=10% D=8%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
