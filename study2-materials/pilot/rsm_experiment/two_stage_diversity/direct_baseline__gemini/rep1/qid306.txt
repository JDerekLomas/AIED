Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on common misconceptions encountered in Year 9 mock exams.

**Teacher's Notes:**
*   **The "BIDMAS Trap":** The most common error in Problem P is the belief that "Addition comes before Subtraction" because A precedes S in the acronym. This leads students to attempt $5+6$ first, often ignoring the negative sign or incorrectly calculating $4-11$.
*   **Problem Q:** Most Year 9 students recognise that Multiplication precedes Addition, but lower-ability students still tend to work purely from left to right.
*   **Distractor D:** This is the "Ultra-Correction" trap. Students who have been told "Addition is not always first" or who over-rely on the literal string of BIDMAS letters often choose D, thinking they must do the addition in P and the multiplication in Q.
