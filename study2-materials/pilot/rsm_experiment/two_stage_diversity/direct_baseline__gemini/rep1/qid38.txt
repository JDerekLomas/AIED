To solve this problem, students must find a common denominator (likely $2x$). 

*   **A ($11/2x$)** is the correct answer. The student multiplies the second fraction by $2/2$ to get $8/2x$ and then adds the numerators ($3+8$).
*   **B ($7/3x$)** is a very common "low-ability" error. The student adds the numerators ($3+4$) and adds the denominators ($2x+x$). This feels natural to students who treat fractions like vectors.
*   **C ($11/x$)** is a calculation error where the student correctly identifies the numerator should be 11 but "forgets" or loses the 2 in the denominator during simplification.
*   **D ($7/2x$)** is the most common "mid-ability" trap. The student correctly identifies $2x$ as the common denominator but fails to scale the second numerator, simply adding $3+4$.
