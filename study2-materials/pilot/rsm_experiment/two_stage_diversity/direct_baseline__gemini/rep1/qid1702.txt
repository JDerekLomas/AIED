To determine the correct value, the student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into $10x - 6y = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, so $x = 3.3$ (Option C).

**Teacher's Analysis of Errors:**
*   **The Trap (Option D):** Many students see "$-6y$" and, when moving it to the other side, subtract instead of adding ($30 - 3 = 27$; $27/10 = 2.7$). This is a classic transposition error.
*   **The Miscalculation (Option A):** Students substitute $y=0.5$ correctly but forget to multiply by 6, or they divide by 10 before adding the 3, or they misinterpret the $0.5$ as needing to be divided by 2 rather than multiplied. Some students incorrectly calculate $6 \times 0.5$ as $0.3$ rather than $3$, leading to $30.3/10$, which they might round or misread as A. 
*   **The Sign Error (Option B):** Choosing the negative version of A is common for students who get confused by the signs during the inverse operation process.

**Predicted Distributions:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often guess based on the numbers appearing in the question or make multiple procedural errors. $2.7$ (Option D) is very attractive here because "30 minus something" feels more intuitive than "30 plus something."
*   **Basic:** This group usually knows to substitute but very frequently makes the sign error when moving $-3$ across the equals sign, leading them directly to D.
*   **Proficient:** These students generally handle the substitution and the inverse operation correctly, but a small percentage will still trip up on the $30 + 3$ step or miscalculate $6 \times 0.5$.
*   **Advanced:** These students will identify the trap and perform the two-step rearrangement mentally or on paper with high accuracy.
