To provide these predictions, I am drawing on common misconceptions found in Key Stage 3 algebra. 

The "attractive" errors here are:
*   **The Addition Error (C/D):** Lower-ability students often default to addition when they see two numbers in a bracket, especially when the question asks what they "get" rather than explicitly saying "multiply." $-1 - 4 = -5$ is a very common mistake.
*   **The Negative Sign Oversight (B):** Students who know to multiply ($1 \times 4$) but struggle with directed numbers will often forget that a "minus times a minus makes a plus."
*   **The Conceptual Trap:** Even "Basic" level students often get confused between the rules for adding negatives and multiplying negatives.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
