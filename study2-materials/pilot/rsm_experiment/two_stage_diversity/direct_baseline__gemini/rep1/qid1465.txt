To predict these results, I have analysed the common Year 9 misconceptions regarding the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS):

*   **A (6):** The correct answer ($4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 + 8 = 6$). Even higher-ability students occasionally trip up on the $3-5$ part, sometimes thinking it is $5-3$.
*   **B (4):** The "Left-to-Right" error. Students ignore the priority of multiplication and simply calculate in order: $3-5 = -2$, then $-2+4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$. This is a very "attractive" error for lower-ability students.
*   **C (-12):** The "Addition before Subtraction" trap combined with multiplication priority. Students perform $5+4 = 9$ (misinterpreting the $-5$ as just $5$), then $9 \times 2 = 18$, then $3-18 = -15$ (or variations leading to -12). More commonly, they do $(3-5+4) \times 2 = 2 \times 2 = 4$, but if they calculate $5+4=9$ first because of the 'A' in BIDMAS, they end up with $3-9 = -6 \times 2 = -12$.
*   **D (-10):** This is the "BIDMAS Blindness" trap. Students do $5+4=9$, then $3-9=-6$, then $-6 \times 2$, or more commonly: $3 - (5+8) = 3 - 13 = -10$. This stems from the rigid belief that Addition *must* come before Subtraction.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on 200 mock papers:

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
