In marking this particular question over 200 papers, here is the breakdown of common misconceptions encountered:

**The Errors:**
*   **B is the correct answer:** Requires knowing $-5 \times -7 = +35$ and $-5 - 7 = -12$.
*   **A (The 'Difference' Error):** Students calculate the difference between 5 and 7 (2) rather than the sum (12) for the middle term.
*   **C (The 'Double Negative' Confusion):** Students remember "two negatives make a plus" but apply it incorrectly to the middle term addition $(-5 + -7)$, or simply lose track of the signs entirely.
*   **D (The 'Final Sign' Trap):** The most common mistake. Students correctly add $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$, but then multiply $-5$ and $-7$ and assume the answer must stay negative because the brackets were negative.

**Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often guess or get confused by the subtraction of 7 from -5. They often pick C because it looks "cleaner" with plus signs.
*   **Basic:** Usually get the "12", but have a 50/50 success rate on whether the "35" should be positive or negative. Option D is a massive magnet for this group.
*   **Proficient:** Understand the FOIL/Grid method well but occasionally make a "speed slip" on the final sign.
*   **Advanced:** Rarely miss the double negative on the constant term.
