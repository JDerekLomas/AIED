In this common Year 9 linear equations problem, the "trap" lies in the final inverse operation. Students frequently perform the inverse of the fraction (multiplication) correctly, but then "reset" their mental logic for the second step, reflexively adding a number to "move" it even when it should be subtracted.

**Calculation Errors:**
- **Step 1:** Is correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$). Errors here usually involve dividing 15 by 4 (3.75) or thinking the 4 only applies to the $k$.
- **Step 2:** Is incorrect ($60 = 1 + k$ requires subtracting 1, giving $k = 59$). The common error is to see the $+1$ and instinctively add 1 to the other side ($60 + 1 = 61$), particularly if they are rushing or using "change side, change sign" rules incorrectly.

**Student Profiles:**
- **Below Basic:** These students struggle with the initial multiplication and often guess D or pick B because "the first part looks too simple to be right."
- **Basic:** This is the peak "trap" group. They feel confident they know how to solve equations but rely on memorised movements rather than balancing. They see the $+1$ and $61$ and think "that's correct addition." Many will choose C.
- **Proficient:** These students will recognise that Step 1 is correct. Many will spot the error in Step 2, though under exam pressure, a significant minority will still tick C by skim-reading.
- **Advanced:** These students will verify both steps mentally. They will see $60 - 1 \neq 61$ immediately and pick A.
