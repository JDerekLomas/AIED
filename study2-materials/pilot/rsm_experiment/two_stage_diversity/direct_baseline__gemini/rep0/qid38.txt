To simplify $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, the correct method is to find a common denominator of $2x$. This requires multiplying the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$, giving $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$ (**A**).

**Common Errors observed in Year 9 scripts:**
*   **The "Add Across" Trap (B):** Adding numerators ($3+4=7$) and adding denominators ($2x+x=3x$). This is the most common misconception for students who struggle with the concept of denominators.
*   **The "Multiply Numerator Only" Error (D):** Recognising a change is needed but only adding the numerators ($3+4=7$) while keeping the larger denominator ($2x$).
*   **The "Double the Numerator" correctly but forgetting the Denominator (C):** Converting $\frac{4}{x}$ to $\frac{8}{x}$ (incorrectly) or simply miscalculating the final denominator.

**Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** Almost exclusively "add across" (B).
*   **Basic:** Fluctuating between adding across (B) and a halfway-correct attempt at a common denominator that usually results in (D).
*   **Proficient:** Usually identify the common denominator. If they fail, it is usually because they add the numerators but forget to scale the second numerator (D).
*   **Advanced:** Rarely miss this, but the most common "fast" error is (D).
