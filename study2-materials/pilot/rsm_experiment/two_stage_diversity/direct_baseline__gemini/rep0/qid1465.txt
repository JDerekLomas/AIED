To arrive at these percentages, I have considered the following common student misconceptions:

*   **The BODMAS/BIDMAS Trap:** Students often mistakenly believe that Addition must come before Subtraction simply because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym. This leads to the calculation $3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 \rightarrow 3 - 9 \times 2$, or more commonly $3 - (5 + 8) \rightarrow -10$.
*   **Left-to-Right Processing (The Linear Error):** Weakest students ignore order of operations entirely, calculating strictly left-to-right: $3 - 5 = -2$; $-2 + 4 = 2$; $2 \times 2 = 4$ (Option B).
*   **The "Addition First" priority:** A very common error is $3 - 9$ (from $5+4$) then $\times 2$, resulting in $-12$ (Option C).
*   **Correct Methodology:** Recognising $4 \times 2 = 8$ first, then $3 - 5 + 8$. However, even here, students often calculate $3 - 13$ instead of moving left-to-right with the remaining addition/subtraction.

**Predicted Distributions:**
