Having marked 200 of these, this question is a classic "read the instructions" trap. While the calculation itself is straightforward, the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number" is what catches the higher-ability students who reflexively convert to improper fractions.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **A (Correct):** The straightforward path ($2+1=3, 1/5+2/5=3/5$).
*   **B (Improper Fraction):** This is the most common "proficient" error. These students know how to add fractions perfectly, but they often convert to improper fractions as a default method ($11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$) and forget to convert back, ignoring the specific format requested.
*   **C (Add Everything):** The "below basic" trap. Students add the numerators AND the denominators ($2+1=3$, then $1/5+2/5=3/10$, or just $3/10$ total). Option C specifically represents the mistake of adding numerators and denominators after converting to improper fractions ($11+7=18$ over $5+5=10$).
*   **D (Add Denominators):** The most common "basic" error. Students add the whole numbers correctly but add the denominators together ($5+5=10$). It "feels" right to them to change all the numbers they see.
