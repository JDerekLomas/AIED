In marking 200 of these Year 9 scripts, the "BODMAS trap" is the single most defining factor. 

In **Problem P**, the "A" in BODMAS (Addition before Subtraction) is a notorious "learned misconception." Many students believe they must add before they subtract, regardless of left-to-right order, leading them to pick $5+6$ as the first step.
In **Problem Q**, the "attractive error" is the "Reading Order" trap—simply performing the calculation from left to right ($4+5$) regardless of operators.

**Breakdown of errors:**
*   **D** is the "Over-application of BODMAS" trap (Adding first in P, Multiplying in Q).
*   **A** is the "Left-to-Right Only" trap (Ignoring order of operations entirely).
*   **B** is the mathematically correct choice (Left-to-right for equal priority +, -; Multiplication before Addition).
*   **C** is the "Total Confusion" option, combining the worst of both errors.
