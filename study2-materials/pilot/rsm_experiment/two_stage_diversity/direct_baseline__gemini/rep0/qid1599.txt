In marking this particular question across 200 papers, the most common pitfall is not the concept of a fraction as division, but rather the "direction" of that fraction and the "scope" of the denominator.

**Option D** is a classic "reversal" error, where students mistakenly believe the first term in a division goes on the bottom because it looks more "stable." **Option C** is a common BIDMAS/notational error where students fail to see the brackets as a binding grouping, leading them to only divide $c$ by $h$. **Option B** is a specific Year 9 hallucination where students feel the need to balance the expression by adding the constant to the numerator as well.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=55% B=10% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=8% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%
