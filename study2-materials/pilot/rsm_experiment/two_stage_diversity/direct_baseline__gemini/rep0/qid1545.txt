In my experience marking this specific order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) question across 200 Year 9 scripts, the common pitfalls are very predictable.

**Thinking Process:**
*   **The Left Side ($8 + 12 \div 4$):** Students often erroneously work left-to-right to get $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$. The correct application of BIDMAS gives $8 + 3 = 11$.
*   **The Right Side ($(8+12) \div 4$):** Brackets force the addition first, giving $20 \div 4 = 5$.
*   **The Trap:** Students who calculate the left side incorrectly as 5 see "5 [ ] 5" and instinctively choose "=". This makes Option C the most "attractive" wrong answer for lower-ability students.
*   **The Confusion:** "Basic" students often think BIDMAS means "Addition before Division" because of the way they misread the acronym, or they simply work left-to-right.
*   **Advanced Students:** They rarely make the arithmetic slip, but a small percentage might overthink the notation $\geq$ (Option D) and wonder if it's "technically correct" but usually stick to A.

**Predicted Results:**

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=10% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=10% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
