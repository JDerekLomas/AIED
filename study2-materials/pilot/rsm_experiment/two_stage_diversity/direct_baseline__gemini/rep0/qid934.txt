In this Year 9 mock, students find this question deceptively difficult because the equation is in the implicit form ($ax + by = c$) rather than the explicit form ($y = mx + c$). 

**The Error Patterns:**
*   **Choice C (5):** This is the most "attractive" trap. Students see $x=0$ and instinctively look at the constant at the end of the equation ($10$), then divide by the coefficient of $y$ ($2$). This is the correct mathematical path, but many do it by "guessing" what looks right with the numbers 0, 2, and 10.
*   **Choice A (20):** Common among lower-ability students who confuse the operation. They see $4(0)$ as $0$, but then mistakenly multiply $10$ by $2$ instead of dividing.
*   **Choice B (3):** This is a "pattern-seeking" error. Students who don't know how to substitute often look at the numbers present ($4, 2$) and assume the missing number in the sequence $2, 3, 4$ or something similar is $3$.
*   **Choice D (2.5):** A "coefficient confusion" error. Students divide 10 by the wrong coefficient (10 ÷ 4), often because they associate the first number in the equation with the first value in the table.
