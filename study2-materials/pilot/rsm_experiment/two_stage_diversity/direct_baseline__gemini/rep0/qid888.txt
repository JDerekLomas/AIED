In marking 200 of these Year 9 papers, several classic misconceptions always emerge.

**Thinking behind the percentages:**
*   **The Negative Rule:** This is the primary hurdle. **B** is the correct answer. Students must manage both $-5 \times -7 = +35$ and $-5 - 7 = -12$.
*   **The "Difference" Error (Option A):** Many lower-ability students confuse addition/subtraction rules. They see 5 and 7 and find the difference (2) rather than the sum (12), or they incorrectly simplify $(-7m + 5m)$ because they ignore one of the negative signs.
*   **The "Everything is Positive" Trap (Option C):** This is the classic "safety" choice for students who don't understand directed numbers. They multiply $5 \times 7$ and add $5 + 7$, ignoring the minus signs entirely.
*   **The "Single Negative" Error (Option D):** This is the most common mistake for proficient students. They correctly sum $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12m$, but their brains tell them "negative times negative must be negative" because the question is "full of minuses." It is a very "attractive" mistake.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=20% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=1% B=94% C=0% D=5%
