Having marked 200 of these, I can tell you that this question is the ultimate "low-stakes trap." The most common error is "calculation by instinct" rather than "calculation by inverse operations." Students see 10 and 5 and immediately think of the number 2 or the number 50.

The "Attractive" Errors:
- **C ($p=2$)** is the primary attractor for **below_basic** and **basic** students. They see $10 = 5/p$ and their brain performs the calculation $10 \div 5$. They are so used to the larger number being the dividend that they don't even look at the structure of the equation.
- **B ($p=50$)** is the classic "multiplication trap." Students see a fraction and know they need to "get rid of it," so they multiply the numbers they see: $10 \times 5 = 50$.
- **A ($p=0.5$)** is the correct answer, but it feels "wrong" to lower-ability students because they don't like decimal/fractional answers when the inputs are integers. **Advanced** students reach this by rearranging to $10p = 5$, then $p = 5/10$. **Proficient** students often get here by trial and error, testing $5 \div 0.5$ in their heads.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=60% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=20% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=14% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
