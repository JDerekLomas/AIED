In my experience marking this specific type of algebra question, the "balance method" versus the "whole equation" approach creates a clear divide between ability groups. 

Tom's approach (adding 5 to both sides) is the standard classroom method and feels very safe. Katie’s approach (multiplying the whole equation by 3) is a common trap. Students often forget that *every* term must be multiplied by 3, resulting in the incorrect \(x - 5 = 36\) instead of the correct \(x - 15 = 36\). This error is highly "attractive" because the \(-5\) looks like a separate entity that students want to deal with later.

**Error Analysis:**
*   **Tom's logic:** Standard inverse operations (\(+5\) to both sides). Correct.
*   **Katie's logic:** Multiplication by the denominator. She multiplied the \(\frac{x}{3}\) and the \(12\), but neglected to multiply the \(-5\). Incorrect.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=25% D=20%
*(These students often guess or have a weak grasp of inverse operations; C is attractive because they assume both must be "clever" enough to be right.)*

basic: A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%
*(The "Both" trap is strongest here. They recognize Tom is right, and Katie's "multiplied by 3" looks mathematically sophisticated enough to be plausible.)*

proficient: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
*(Most have been drilled to add/subtract before multiplying/dividing. They spot Tom is right, but a significant minority still get lured by Katie’s half-finished multiplication.)*

advanced: A=92% B=1% C=5% D=2%
*(Advanced students instinctively check Katie’s work by attempting to solve it. They realize \(x-5=36 \implies x=41\), which doesn't fit the original equation, catching the error.)*
