In Year 9, this is a classic "sign trap" question. While the operation is clearly defined as multiplication, many students under pressure revert to additive thinking, especially when they see two negative signs together.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A (+4):** The correct calculation. Needs both the knowledge of multiplication and the rule that a negative multiplied by a negative is a positive.
*   **B (-4):** The most common mistake for middle-attainers. They multiply $1 \times 4$ but fail to apply the double negative rule, or they incorrectly assume that because there are minus signs in the brackets, the result must be negative.
*   **C (+5):** A "distractor" for those who see two numbers and add them, then apply a vague rule about "two minuses making a plus."
*   **D (-5):** The "Below Basic" trap. These students see $-1$ and $-4$ and combine them as if they are simplifying an expression ($-1 - 4 = -5$) rather than multiplying.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=35% B=45% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=70% B=25% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
