In marking this question, I look for how students handle decimals, the order of operations (BIDMAS), and the conceptual understanding of squaring.

**Diagnostic of Errors:**
*   **Option A ($0.81$):** This is the "multiply by $x$ then square" error—i.e., $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2$. It’s highly attractive to students who ignore BIDMAS.
*   **Option B ($0.27$):** The correct answer ($3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$).
*   **Option C ($1.8$):** This comes from doubling instead of squaring ($3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$) or simply misinterpreting $x^2$ as $2x$. 
*   **Option D ($2.7$):** A classic place-value error where students square $0.3$ and get $0.9$ instead of $0.09$, then multiply by $3$. 

**Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often confuse squaring with doubling or combine all numbers they see.
*   **Basic:** Usually know to square first, but frequently make the "0.3 squared is 0.9" place-value error.
*   **Proficient:** Understand BIDMAS but can still be tripped up by the $0.09$ vs $0.9$ decimal placement.
*   **Advanced:** Usually comfortable with both the order of operations and decimal multiplication.

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=25% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
