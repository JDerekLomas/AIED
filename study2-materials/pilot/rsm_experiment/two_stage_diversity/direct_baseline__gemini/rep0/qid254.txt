Having marked hundreds of these papers, the "Zero" is the ultimate trap for Year 9. Students frequently conflate "value" with "existence."

Here is the breakdown of the common pitfalls:
*   **The Trap of A:** This is the most "attractive" wrong answer. Students recognize there are 5 numbers, but their brain skips the 0 in the numerator because "adding zero doesn't change the total." They see it as a shortcut.
*   **The Trap of B:** This tests BIDMAS/Order of Operations. Students who read left-to-right without thinking about the fraction bar or brackets fall for this. It looks like the "correct process" written in a single line.
*   **The Trap of C:** This is the classic "ignored the zero entirely" error. These students divide by 4 because they only count the "meaningful" numbers.
*   **The "None of Them" Logic:** High-ability students will look for $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$. When they don't see the zero in the numerator, they have to decide if Option A is "close enough" or if Option D is technically the only correct path.

**Calculation Errors:**
*   **A:** Correct sum, correct divisor, but perceived as "missing the zero." Technically, $0+1+3+4+7$ is identical to $1+3+4+7$, so **A is mathematically correct.**
*   **B:** Calculates $0+1+3+4+(7 \div 5)$, resulting in $9.4$ instead of $3$.
*   **C:** Incorrect divisor (ignores the data point of 0).

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=5%
*(Below basic students often pick B because it "looks" like the sum followed by the division, or C because they don't count zero as a number.)*

basic: A=35% B=25% C=30% D=10%
*(Basic students start to realise the divisor must be 5, but many still reflexively exclude the 0 from the count.)*

proficient: A=65% B=5% C=15% D=15%
*(Proficient students know to divide by 5. Many will correctly identify A as mathematically valid, though a significant portion will pick D thinking the 0 *must* be explicitly written.)*

advanced: A=85% B=0% C=5% D=10%
*(Advanced students recognise that $x + 0 = x$ and therefore A is the only mathematically sound expression provided. Only the "over-thinkers" will opt for D.)*
