To reach the product of $-1$, the missing value must be the **reciprocal** of $-\frac{3}{4}$.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option A ($\frac{4}{3}$):** This is the most "attractive" trap. Students correctly identify that the fraction needs to be flipped (reciprocal) but forget that a negative times a positive equals a negative. They see the negative sign in the question and the negative in the answer and assume they "cancel out" via the star being positive.
*   **Option B ($-\frac{4}{3}$):** The correct answer. Students must manage both the reciprocal and the sign rule (negative $\times$ negative = positive).
*   **Option C ($\frac{3}{4}$):** Chosen by students who think they just need to "get rid" of the minus sign to get to $-1$ (confusing addition/subtraction rules with multiplication).
*   **Option D ($-\frac{3}{4}$):** Chosen by lower-ability students who see $-1$ and assume they are multiplying by $1$ (identity property) or are simply overwhelmed by the fraction notation.
