To predict the performance for this Year 9 question, we must look at the common pitfalls involving negative signs and order of operations.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A is the correct answer:** $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$. Wait, recalculating: $10x - 3 = 30$ means $10x = 33$, so $x = 3.3$. 
*   **Wait, let me re-evaluate the options based on common student errors:**
    *   **Option C (3.3)** is the correct mathematical result of $10x - 3 = 30$.
    *   **Option D (2.7)** is the most common "sign error" trap. Students calculate $10x + 3 = 30$, leading to $10x = 27$ and $x = 2.7$. This happens when students move the $-3$ across the equals sign but subtract it instead of adding it.
    *   **Option A (4.25)** comes from a substitution error where students accidentally swap $x$ and $y$. If they plug $x=0.5$ into the equation: $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y \approx -4.16$ (or $y = 4.25$ if they make a further arithmetic slip with 30 and 4).
    *   **Option B (-4.25)** is the "low ability guess" when they see a negative sign in the equation and assume the answer must be negative.

**Student Behaviour:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often guess or perform a single operation (e.g., $30 \div 10 + 0.5$).
*   **Basic:** Usually manage the substitution but fail the "change the side, change the sign" rule, making **D** incredibly attractive.
*   **Proficient:** Understand the algebra but are prone to the "minus a minus" confusion or simple division slips.
*   **Advanced:** Will substitute correctly and handle the two-step equation with ease.
