Having marked 200 of these scripts, this question is a classic "fraction trap." Students often struggle when an operation involves a fraction already present on one side of the equals sign.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option A ($p=1/4$):** This is the most common error. Students see the 3 and the 12 and immediately think of the relationship $12 \div 3 = 4$. They perform the inverse operation on the denominator rather than the whole fraction, effectively calculating $\frac{1}{12 \div 3}$.
*   **Option B (Correct):** Students must multiply both sides by $1/3$ (or divide by 3), resulting in $\frac{1}{12 \times 3} = \frac{1}{36}$.
*   **Option C ($p=4$):** A complete reversal of logic. These students usually multiply 12 by $1/3$ (to get 4) but lose the fractional structure entirely, or they misinterpret the equation as $3/p = 12$.
*   **Option D ($p=1/9$):** A "distractor" for those who try to find a common factor or somehow relate $3^2$ to the problem, though it is less common than A or C.
