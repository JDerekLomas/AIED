In this Year 9 mock, this question is a classic test of algebraic manipulation involving fractions and powers. Many students struggle with "undoing" a fraction.

*   **A is the "multiplication trap":** Students who see $4/3$ and decide to multiply both sides by $4/3$ (or just keep the cluster together) land here. It’s an incredibly common error for those who don't understand reciprocal operations.
*   **B is the "incomplete rearrangement":** Students who correctly move the $\pi$ but fail to flip the $4/3$. 
*   **C is the correct answer:** Requires multiplying by $3$, dividing by $4\pi$, then cube-rooting.
*   **D is the "order of operations" error:** Students who attempt to cube root $V$ first and then simply stick the numbers back on as a coefficient without considering they were also part of the root.

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 papers:

below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=30% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=93% D=2%
