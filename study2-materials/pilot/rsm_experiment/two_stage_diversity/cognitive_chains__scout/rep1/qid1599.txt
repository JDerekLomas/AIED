To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the perspectives provided and relate them to common misconceptions and understanding of algebraic conventions.

**Understanding Algebraic Conventions**: 
The correct algebraic convention for $c \div (h+4)$ is $A) \frac{c}{h+4}$. This is because division by a quantity is equivalent to multiplication by its reciprocal, but when expressed as a fraction, the dividend goes on top, and the divisor goes on the bottom.

**Common Misconceptions**:
- A common misconception is to confuse the order of operations or misinterpret the division by a sum as separate operations (leading to option C).
- Another misconception is switching the numerator and denominator (option D).
- Adding or altering parts of the expression in a way not supported by the given problem (option B) is also a misconception.

**Student Ability Levels**:
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully grasp basic algebraic conventions. They might lean towards what "looks right" or common mistakes they have made before.
  - A: 40% (they recognize $c$ should be on top but may question the brackets)
  - B: 20% (unfamiliarity with handling $+4$)
  - C: 25% (mistaking division for separate operations)
  - D: 15% (swapping numerator and denominator)

- **Basic**: Students at this level understand fundamentals but might struggle with nuanced rules or making careless mistakes.
  - A: 60% (begin to grasp algebraic conventions)
  - B: 15% (misinterpretation of brackets and operations)
  - C: 15% (old habit of separate operations)
  - D: 10% (less likely to swap, but possible)

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid foundation and usually apply rules correctly but might get swayed by familiar but incorrect patterns.
  - A: 80% (majority applies algebraic conventions)
  - B: 5% (misunderstanding of bracket effect)
  - C: 10% (still some misunderstanding)
  - D: 5% (minor chance of confusion)

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand algebraic rules but can also reason abstractly. Mistakes are fewer but can still reason through flawed logic.
  - A: 95% (most accurately application)
  - B: 2% (exception rather than norm)
  - C: 2% (misstep by exception)
  - D: 1% (nearly no confusion among top performers)
