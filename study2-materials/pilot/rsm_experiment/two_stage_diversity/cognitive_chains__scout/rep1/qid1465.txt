## Step 1: Analyzing the Question and Perspectives
The question requires evaluating the expression \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). According to the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), multiplication should be performed before addition and subtraction. Therefore, the correct calculation is \(3 - 5 + 8\), which simplifies to \(-2 + 8 = 6\).

## 2: Understanding the Perspectives
Each perspective provided shows a student's thought process in solving the expression. Most students initially make mistakes but then correct themselves by applying the BIDMAS rule. The correct answer is A) 6.

## 3: Evaluating Student Performance at Different Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with applying the order of operations or with basic arithmetic. They are more likely to get the wrong answer or not follow the correct procedure.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may make careless mistakes or not fully apply rules like BIDMAS consistently.
- **Proficient**: These students understand and can apply the order of operations correctly but might make minor errors in calculation.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are likely to solve the problem correctly with ease and understand the application of BIDMAS.

## 4: Predicting Percentages for Each Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: These students might not fully grasp BIDMAS or make significant calculation errors. They could choose A) 6 if they partially understand BIDMAS but are more likely to choose incorrect options. Let's assume B) 4, C) -12, or D) -10 are tempting due to incorrect calculations or misunderstandings. A) 6 might seem correct to some who partially get it, but many might choose D) -10 or C) -12 due to not following BIDMAS correctly.
- **Basic**: Students here are more likely to understand BIDMAS but might still make simple arithmetic mistakes. A) 6 is likely, but some might get confused and choose other options.
- **Proficient**: These students should mostly choose A) 6, as they understand BIDMAS and can perform the calculation.
- **Advanced**: It's expected that nearly all students at this level choose A) 6, as they not only understand BIDMAS but also perform calculations accurately.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Given the complexity and the thought processes described:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some get it through intuition or partial understanding), B=20%, C=10%, D=30% (significant errors).
- **Basic**: A=70%, B=15%, C=5%, D=10% (mostly correct but some confusion).
- **Proficient**: A=90%, B=5%, C=2%, D=3% (mostly accurate with some minor errors).
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5% (very high accuracy).

## 6: Finalizing Percentages in Required Format
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
