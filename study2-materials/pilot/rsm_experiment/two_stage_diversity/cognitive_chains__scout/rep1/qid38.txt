Based on the provided perspectives, I've analyzed the thought processes and predicted the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option.

**Below Basic:**
At this level, students may struggle with basic fraction concepts and algebraic notation. They might not fully understand the need for a common denominator or make errors in adding fractions.

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%

**Basic:**
Students at this level have some understanding of fractions and algebraic notation but may still make errors or struggle with finding a common denominator.

basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%

**Proficient:**
Proficient students have a solid understanding of fractions and algebraic notation. They can find a common denominator and add fractions correctly.

proficient: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%

**Advanced:**
Advanced students have a deep understanding of fractions and algebraic notation. They can simplify expressions and apply mathematical concepts with ease.

advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

These predictions are based on the provided perspectives, which show that:

* Most students, even at the basic level, can understand the need for a common denominator.
* Option A) \(\frac{11}{2x}\) is the correct answer and will be chosen by the majority of students at all levels.
* Option B) \(\frac{7}{3x}\) is a common incorrect answer, likely chosen by students who add the denominators incorrectly.
* Options C) \(\frac{11}{x}\) and D) \(\frac{7}{2x}\) are less likely to be chosen, as they represent more significant errors in understanding fractions and algebraic notation.
