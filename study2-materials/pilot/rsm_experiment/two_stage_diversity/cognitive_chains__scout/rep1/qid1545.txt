To solve this, let's analyze the student's thought processes as provided and then infer the likely outcomes based on common mathematical understanding and the application of BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction).

## Step 1: Understanding BIDMAS and the Operations
BIDMAS dictates the order of operations: Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction. For the given expressions:
1. $8 + 12 \div 4$
2. $(8 + 12) \div 4$

Applying BIDMAS:
1. $8 + 12 \div 4 = 8 + 3 = 11$
2. $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$

## 2: Comparing the Expressions
Since $11 > 5$, the correct symbol to use is $>$.

## 3: Analyzing Student Perspectives
- Most students initially make errors but eventually apply BIDMAS correctly.
- They compare the two sides and determine that $11 > 5$, leading them to choose option A) $>$.

## 4: Predicting Student Choices by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with BIDMAS and comparing numbers. They might incorrectly apply operations or compare numbers.
- **Basic**: These students may initially get confused but then apply BIDMAS to get the right answer or still make simple errors.
- **Proficient**: Students here are likely to apply BIDMAS correctly and understand the comparison.
- **Advanced**: These students will accurately apply BIDMAS and understand that $11 > 5$.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: Likely to see a mix of incorrect answers due to misunderstanding BIDMAS and comparisons. A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%
- **Basic**: Students start to grasp BIDMAS but might still make errors. A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%
- **Proficient**: Mostly correct application of BIDMAS. A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%
- **Advanced**: High accuracy with BIDMAS and comparisons. A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
