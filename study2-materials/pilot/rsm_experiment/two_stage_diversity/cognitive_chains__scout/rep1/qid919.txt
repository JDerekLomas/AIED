## Step 1: Analyzing the perspectives provided
The perspectives provided show a range of students' thought processes and calculations for solving the equation \(y = 3x^2\) when \(x = 0.3\). Most students correctly apply the BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) rule, which dictates that indices (squaring in this case) should be calculated before multiplication.

## 2: Identifying the correct answer
The correct calculation following BIDMAS is \(y = 3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\). This corresponds to option B.

## 3: Considering student abilities
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with applying BIDMAS correctly or calculating with decimals. They might incorrectly calculate \(0.3^2\) as \(0.3 \times 2 = 0.6\) or confuse the operations, leading to incorrect answers like A, C, or D.
- **Basic:** Basic-level students are likely to understand the concept of BIDMAS and applying it to simple equations. However, they might make minor calculation errors or not double-check their work, potentially leading to a distribution across the options but with a higher likelihood of choosing B.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students should be able to accurately apply BIDMAS and perform the calculations correctly, leading to a strong likelihood of choosing option B. They might also recognize common pitfalls and double-check their calculations.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to not only choose the correct option (B) but also understand why the other options are incorrect and demonstrate a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts.

## 4: Predicting student choices
Given the calculations and thought processes shown, we can predict that:
- Most students, regardless of ability level, who understand and apply BIDMAS correctly will choose option B (0.27).
- A common mistake would be to calculate \(3 \times 0.3 = 0.9\) and then square it, leading to option A (0.81).
- Options C (1.8) and D (2.7) seem less likely to be chosen as they do not directly result from common misapplications of BIDMAS or simple calculation errors based on the provided perspectives.

## 5: Assigning percentages
Based on the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** Might have a higher chance of choosing incorrect options due to misunderstandings of BIDMAS or decimal calculations. Let's assume A=40%, B=30%, C=15%, D=15%.
- **Basic:** Should have a better understanding, so B=60%, A=25%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** Likely to choose B correctly, with some awareness of common errors. So, B=80%, A=15%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** Nearly all would choose B, and might also discuss why A is a common error. So, B=95%, A=4%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=25% B=60% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=80% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=4% B=95% C=0.5% D=0.5%
