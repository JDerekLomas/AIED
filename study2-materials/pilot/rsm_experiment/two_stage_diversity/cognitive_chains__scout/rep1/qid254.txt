To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the perspectives provided and relate them to common misconceptions and understanding of mathematical operations, especially regarding the calculation of the mean and the application of BIDMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction).

### Below Basic
Students at this level may have difficulty with basic arithmetic operations, understanding of the mean, and application of BIDMAS.
- **A**: These students might understand the concept of adding numbers and dividing by the count but may not fully grasp the implications of BIDMAS or might make simple arithmetic errors. They could still choose A if they've seen examples of mean calculations.
- **B**: This option directly shows adding all numbers but improperly suggests dividing only the 7 by 5 due to BIDMAS, which could appeal to those misunderstanding the order of operations.
- **C**: Choosing C indicates a misunderstanding of the count of numbers, suggesting a basic error in counting or in understanding that zero is a value.
- **D**: Students might choose D if they recognize errors in the other options but not understand the correct approach.

**Prediction**: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%

### Basic
Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still struggle with applying concepts to new situations or might have misconceptions.
- **A**: Likely to choose A as it represents a straightforward mean calculation without the zero, which they might not consider changing the sum.
- **B**: Might choose B due to its appearance of incorporating all numbers but failing to apply BIDMAS correctly.
- **C**: Could choose C if still unsure about counting zeros as numbers.
- **D**: Less likely to choose D as they have a basic grasp of what’s needed.

**Prediction**:
basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%

### Proficient
Proficient students understand the concepts but might make careless mistakes or be swayed by superficial similarities to correct formulas.
- **A**: Will likely choose A, recognizing it as the standard formula for mean.
- **B**: Unlikely to choose B due to BIDMAS issues.
- **C**: Will not choose C, knowing the correct count of numbers.
- **D**: Not necessary for them unless questioning each option’s validity.

**Prediction**:
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%

### Advanced
Advanced students have deep conceptual understanding and can apply it to varied situations.
- **A**: Will choose A as it correctly calculates the mean.
- **B**: Easily recognize B as incorrect due to BIDMAS.
- **C**: Will not choose C due to a clear understanding of counting.
- **D**: Generally, would not choose D.

**Prediction**:
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%

The final response in the required format:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
