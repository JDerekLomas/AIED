Based on the provided perspectives, here's a breakdown of the potential choices for students at different ability levels:

**Below Basic:**
At this level, students may struggle with algebraic manipulation and fraction operations. They might not understand the concept of isolating the variable or may make careless errors.

* A: $p=\frac{1}{4}$: 60% (initial incorrect calculation, may not revisit)
* B: $p=\frac{1}{36}$: 20% (some might recall or guess the correct answer)
* C: $p=4$: 10% (misinterpretation of the equation)
* D: $p=\frac{1}{9}$: 10% (unrelated or random guess)

**Basic:**
Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra and fractions but may still make errors or struggle with more complex calculations.

* A: $p=\frac{1}{4}$: 40% (initial incorrect calculation, may not fully understand fraction division)
* B: $p=\frac{1}{36}$: 50% (understand the concept but may make calculation errors)
* C: $p=4$: 5% (less likely to make this mistake)
* D: $p=\frac{1}{9}$: 5% (random or incorrect guess)

**Proficient:**
Proficient students have a good grasp of algebra and fraction operations. They might still make some errors, but they are more likely to catch and correct them.

* A: $p=\frac{1}{4}$: 10% (early error, but likely to revisit and correct)
* B: $p=\frac{1}{36}$: 80% (understand the concept and perform calculations correctly)
* C: $p=4$: 5% (unlikely to make this mistake, but possible)
* D: $p=\frac{1}{9}$: 5% (random or incorrect guess)

**Advanced:**
Advanced students have a strong understanding of algebra and fraction operations. They are likely to solve the problem efficiently and accurately.

* A: $p=\frac{1}{4}$: 0% ( unlikely to make this mistake)
* B: $p=\frac{1}{36}$: 95% (accurately solve the equation)
* C: $p=4$: 0% (extremely unlikely to make this mistake)
* D: $p=\frac{1}{9}$: 5% (unlikely, but may consider alternative approaches)

The predicted percentages are:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=50% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
