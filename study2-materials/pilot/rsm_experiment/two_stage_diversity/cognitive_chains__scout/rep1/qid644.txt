To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the perspectives provided and relate them to the typical understanding and mistakes students might have at different levels.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question involves expanding brackets using the FOIL method and understanding the multiplication of negative numbers. The correct answer, when multiplying -1 and -4, is +4.

## 2: Analyzing Student Perspectives
- **Perspective 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:** All these students correctly identify that they need to multiply -1 and -4. Most of them remember that two minuses make a plus, leading them to choose answer A) +4. However, there are moments of confusion in each perspective, indicating common pitfalls such as forgetting the rule for multiplying negative numbers or confusing it with addition.

## 3: Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic operations and rules. They might not understand the FOIL method or the rule for multiplying negative numbers, potentially leading to a higher chance of choosing incorrect options.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make frequent mistakes, such as confusing addition and multiplication or forgetting rules.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of the concepts and are less likely to make careless mistakes. They understand the FOIL method and the rules for negative number multiplication.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand these concepts but can also apply them efficiently and accurately, with minimal chance of error.

## 4: Predicting Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** These students might have a harder time recalling that two negatives make a positive. They could be confused about whether to add or multiply, potentially leading to a spread across B, C, and D due to misunderstandings. Let's assume A=60% (those who somehow managed to recall the rule or guess correctly), B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Basic:** Students here are more likely to get it right or be confused between addition and multiplication of the numbers. So, A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** This group is expected to have a strong grasp of the concept. Thus, A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.
- **Advanced:** These students will almost certainly choose A. So, A=99%, B=1%, C=0%, D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
