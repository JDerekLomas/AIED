## Step 1: Analyze the given perspectives to understand common mistakes and correct approaches.
The perspectives provided show various students' thought processes in solving the problem. Most students correctly recall the volume formula for a sphere as \(V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\) and proceed to solve for \(r\). The steps involve multiplying by 3, then dividing by \(4\pi\) to isolate \(r^3\), and finally taking the cube root to solve for \(r\). The correct solution is \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\), which corresponds to option C.

## 2: Identify common misconceptions and errors.
Common errors include misremembering the formula, incorrectly manipulating the equation (e.g., wrongly placing numbers or operations), and confusion about which operations to perform and when. For instance, some students incorrectly stated or applied the formula, but most were able to derive the correct expression for \(r\) given the volume formula.

## 3: Assess the difficulty level of the question and the likely performance of students at different ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with recalling the formula, understanding the relationship between volume and radius, or performing algebraic manipulations. They are more likely to choose incorrect options due to these challenges.
- **Basic:** Students at this level can recall the formula and perform basic algebraic steps but might make simple errors in manipulation or in identifying the correct option.
- **Proficient:** These students can accurately recall the formula, perform the necessary algebraic steps correctly, and choose the correct option. They might still make minor errors but are more likely to be accurate.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are not only accurate in their calculations but also efficient. They are likely to choose the correct option with confidence.

## 4: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option at different ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Given the simplicity of the question and the clarity of the correct path, even students who are below basic might stumble upon the correct formula and derivation, but errors in algebraic manipulation or formula recall are common. Thus, A=20%, B=20%, C=40%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students here are more likely to get it right as they understand the basics. A=10%, B=10%, C=75%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** These students are confident in their algebraic manipulations and formula recall. A=5%, B=5%, C=90%, D=0%.
- **Advanced:** This group is expected to perform flawlessly. A=0%, B=0%, C=100%, D=0%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
