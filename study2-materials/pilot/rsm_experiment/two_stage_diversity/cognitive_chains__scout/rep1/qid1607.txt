To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the perspectives provided and relate them to typical student understanding and common misconceptions in algebra.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task involves evaluating the correctness of two steps in solving a simple algebraic equation: \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\). Step 1 involves multiplying both sides by 4 to get \(60 = 1 + k\), which is correct. Step 2 involves solving for \(k\) by getting \(k = 61\), which is incorrect because it should be \(k = 59\).

## 2: Analyzing Common Misconceptions
A common misconception among students is not applying the inverse operation correctly when isolating a variable. In this case, if \(60 = 1 + k\), to solve for \(k\), one should subtract 1 from both sides, yielding \(k = 59\), not add 1.

## 3: Ability Levels and Expected Outcomes
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and are likely to choose an option that reflects a lack of understanding of both steps, or they might incorrectly validate steps based on flawed reasoning.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding and are more likely to identify Step 1 as correct but may struggle with Step 2, potentially choosing A) Only step 1.
- **Proficient:** These students understand algebraic manipulations well and are likely to correctly identify Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect, choosing A) Only step 1.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the manipulations but also can quickly identify the errors and correctness of steps, likely choosing A) Only step 1.

## 4: Predicting Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** May have a higher chance of choosing D) Neither, due to a lack of understanding, but could also mistakenly think both are correct or only step 2. A=20%, B=10%, C=10%, D=60%.
- **Basic:** Should recognize Step 1 is correct, and with some guidance, might see Step 2's flaw. A=60%, B=15%, C=5%, D=20%.
- **Proficient:** Should clearly see Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect. A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced:** Will accurately assess both steps. A=90%, B=0%, C=0%, D=10%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
