Analyzing the perspectives provided, it's evident that all students, regardless of their ability level, are capable of arriving at the correct answer, B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \), through various methods and understandings of fraction addition and mixed numbers. However, the likelihood of selecting incorrect options may vary based on the student's ability to apply mathematical concepts accurately.

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with finding a common denominator or converting between mixed numbers and improper fractions. They are more prone to errors such as adding the fractions by simply adding the numerators and denominators (leading to D) \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \)) or not converting their answer into a mixed number when required (leading to A) \( \frac{99}{20} \) ). Their understanding might not be solidified enough to correctly identify B as the proper mixed number. Given their challenges, they are less likely to choose C) \( \frac{99}{40} \) due to its improper formatting as a response. I'd predict:
  - A=30% (because it represents the correct calculation but in improper fraction form),
  - B=40% (since they can arrive at the mixed number with guidance or re-evaluation),
  - C=5%,
  - D=25%.

- **Basic:** These students have a foundational understanding and are more likely to get to B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \) through methods similar to those shown in the perspectives. However, the struggle to apply concepts under timed conditions might lead some to choose A) \( \frac{99}{20} \) since it's the improper fraction equivalent of B. 
  - A=20%,
  - B=70%,
  - C=5%,
  - D=5%.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the concepts well and are adept at applying them. They'd likely choose B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \) directly, but there might still be some tendency to see A) \( \frac{99}{20} \) as equivalent or simply not converting due to oversight. 
  - A=10%,
  - B=85%,
  - C=3%,
  - D=2%.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only know the procedure but also understand the equivalence between different representations of the same number. Therefore, they're very likely to choose B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \) and recognize A) \( \frac{99}{20} \) as equivalent but will favor B due to the question's directive. They are the least likely to choose C or D due to their strong foundation in mathematics.
  - A=5%,
  - B=90%,
  - C=2%,
  - D=3%.

Therefore, in exact format:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=5% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=85% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
