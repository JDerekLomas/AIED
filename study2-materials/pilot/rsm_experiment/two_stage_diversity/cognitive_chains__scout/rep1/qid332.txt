To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the perspectives provided and relate them to typical student understanding and common misconceptions in algebra.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to evaluate two proposed next steps in solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\): Tom's \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\) and Katie's \(x - 5 = 36\). Students need to determine if either, both, or neither of these steps is correct.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Approach
Tom's approach involves adding 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate \(\frac{x}{3}\), resulting in \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This is a straightforward and correct application of inverse operations to solve for \(x\).

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Approach
Katie's approach involves multiplying every term by 3 to clear the fraction, which would correctly result in \(x - 15 = 36\) if done properly. However, Katie's line \(x - 5 = 36\) shows she forgot to multiply the -5 by 3.

## 4: Evaluating Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They may not fully understand inverse operations or how to handle fractions in equations. Given the straightforward nature of Tom's correct solution and the obvious mistake in Katie's, we might expect a significant portion to incorrectly choose or struggle with the concept, but Tom's method is more directly understandable.
  
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a foundational understanding of algebra. They should be able to see Tom's solution as correct but might be confused by Katie's mistake. There's a chance they could incorrectly choose B if they don't fully grasp the multiplication step.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand algebraic manipulations well. They should easily identify Tom's solution as correct and recognize Katie's mistake. They are less likely to choose B or D.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the algebraic manipulations but also can explain why certain steps are correct or incorrect. They should have no trouble identifying Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect due to her not multiplying -5 by 3.

## 5: Predicting Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=60% (finding Tom correct is straightforward), B=20% (might see Katie's but not understand her mistake), C=10% (unlikely to see both as correct), D=10% (might not understand either).
- **Basic:** A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
