To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the given perspectives.

The question requires students to apply the BIDMAS rule (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) to two problems:

Problem P: \(4 - 5 + 6\)

Problem Q: \(4 + 5 \times 6\)

## Step 1: Understanding BIDMAS Application
For Problem P, the BIDMAS rule implies that since there are no Brackets, Indices, Division, or Multiplication, we only consider Addition and Subtraction. Addition comes before Subtraction in BIDMAS, so \(5 + 6\) should be done first.

## 2: Analyzing Problem Q
For Problem Q, Multiplication comes before Addition according to BIDMAS, so \(5 \times 6\) should be done first.

## 3: Evaluating Student Understanding at Different Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand or apply the BIDMAS rule correctly. They might choose options based on simple left-to-right calculations or misunderstand the rule.
- **Basic:** Students here have a basic grasp of BIDMAS but might struggle with its application, especially in cases where operations are of the same precedence (like addition and subtraction).
- **Proficient:** These students understand and can apply BIDMAS correctly but might make minor errors under pressure.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand BIDMAS but can also apply it in complex scenarios and explain their reasoning.

## 4: Predicting Student Choices
Given the BIDMAS rule, the correct approach is:
- For Problem P: Since Addition and Subtraction have equal precedence in BIDMAS and occur in order from left to right for operations of equal precedence, \(4 - 5\) should be done first, not \(5 + 6\). This aligns with option B.
- For Problem Q: \(5 \times 6\) first, which aligns with options B and D.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
- **Below Basic:** Might not understand BIDMAS well, so A, C, or D might be chosen due to confusion. However, without a solid understanding, B might not be selected often. Let's assume A=30%, B=20%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Basic:** Understands BIDMAS but may struggle. The correct sequence for P and Q leads them to B. So, A=10%, B=60%, C=15%, D=15%.
- **Proficient:** Applies BIDMAS correctly. Thus, B seems more plausible because it follows left-to-right for equal precedence operations. A=5%, B=70%, C=5%, D=20%.
- **Advanced:** Clearly understands and applies BIDMAS, and the nuance of equal precedence leads them to choose B. A=0%, B=80%, C=0%, D=20%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=0% B=80% C=0% D=20%
