To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the perspectives provided and relate them to typical student understanding at different levels.

## Step 1: Understanding the Perspectives
All perspectives start with the correct formula for the volume of a sphere, \(V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\), and correctly derive the formula for \(r\) as \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\). This suggests that students who have a good grasp of the formula and algebraic manipulation can correctly identify option C.

## 2: Analyzing Errors and Misconceptions
- Option A incorrectly places \(4V\pi\) in the numerator.
- Option B incorrectly places \(4\) in the numerator and \(\pi\) in the denominator within the cube root.
- Option D introduces an incorrect form with \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \), suggesting a misunderstanding of both the formula and algebraic manipulation.

## 3: Relating to Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and remembering formulas. They might choose options based on superficial recognition or incorrect manipulations. Expect a higher likelihood of choosing A or D due to confusion.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes or misunderstand the algebraic steps. They are likely to choose B or A due to slight misinterpretations of the formula.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts and can apply them correctly. They should predominantly choose C, with some potential for B or A due to minor errors in calculation or recall.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can derive and apply formulas accurately. They are expected to choose C, with minimal errors.

## 4: Predicting Percentages
Given the correct derivation leads to option C, and analyzing common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (misapplication of formula), B=20% (similar but distinct error), C=30% (some correctly recall or derive), D=20% (alternative incorrect formulation).
- **Basic:** A=15%, B=25% (common mistake in algebraic manipulation), C=50% (correct derivation), D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=10%, C=80% (correct), D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=5%, C=90% (confidently correct), D=5%.

## 5: Final Predictions
Based on typical performance expectations:
- below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- basic: A=15% B=25% C=50% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=25% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
