## Step 1: Analyze the given perspectives to understand common errors and thought processes.
The perspectives provided show a range of thought processes, including correct applications of BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction), incorrect applications, and instances of self-doubt. Most students eventually arrive at the correct answer, A) \( > \), but through various routes and with different levels of confidence.

## 2: Identify the correct answer based on mathematical principles.
The correct calculation is:
- Left side: \(8 + 12 \div 4 = 8 + 3 = 11\)
- Right side: \((8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5\)
Since \(11 > 5\), the correct symbol is \( > \), making option A the correct answer.

## 3: Consider the ability levels and their implications on student performance.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic mathematical operations and the application of BIDMAS. They might incorrectly calculate or compare the values.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors, especially under time pressure or with complex problems.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the mathematical concepts and can apply BIDMAS correctly but might still have moments of doubt.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are confident in their understanding and application of mathematical concepts.

## 4: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level.
- **Below Basic**: Students might not fully understand BIDMAS or might calculate incorrectly. They could choose B) \( < \) if they miscalculate or misunderstand the comparison.
- **Basic**: Students are likely to understand the basic operations but might still get confused with BIDMAS, potentially leading to B) \( < \) or C) \( = \).
- **Proficient**: Most students here will apply BIDMAS correctly and choose A) \( > \), with minimal errors.
- **Advanced**: These students will confidently choose A) \( > \).

## 5: Predict specific percentages based on typical student performance.
Given the nature of the question and common student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=60% (still might get it right with luck), B=30% (incorrect calculation leading to wrong comparison), C=5% (thinking they are equal), D=5% (not understanding inequalities).
- **Basic**: A=80%, B=15%, C=4%, D=1%.
- **Proficient**: A=95%, B=4%, C=1%, D=0%.
- **Advanced**: A=99%, B=1%, C=0%, D=0%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=80% B=15% C=4% D=1%
proficient: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
