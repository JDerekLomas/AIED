## Step 1: Analyze the given perspectives to understand common student thought processes.
The perspectives provided show various students' thought processes when solving the given math problem. Most students correctly identify that to add fractions, they need a common denominator, which in this case is 20. They also correctly convert the fractions to have this common denominator and then add them.

## 2: Identify the correct answer based on the problem statement.
The correct answer, following the instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number, is \(4 \frac{19}{20}\), which corresponds to option B. Option A, \(\frac{99}{20}\), is also correct but is an improper fraction, and the question specifies leaving the answer as a mixed number.

## 3: Assess the likelihood of students choosing each option based on their ability levels.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with finding a common denominator or converting between mixed numbers and improper fractions. They might be more likely to choose incorrect options like D, which represents adding the numerators and denominators directly, a common misconception. Option B, being the correct mixed number, might be chosen by a significant portion if they understand the concept of mixed numbers but could also be confused by the direct addition method.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp of basic fraction operations. They are likely to understand the need for a common denominator and can perform the conversion. However, they might still fall for misconceptions like adding the denominators directly (option D). The majority are expected to choose option B.

- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand fraction operations well and are less likely to make mistakes like adding denominators or numerators directly. They should easily arrive at option B and might also recognize option A as a correct but not specified form.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the operations but also can see the relationship between mixed numbers and improper fractions. They will likely choose option B as it matches the question's requirement to leave the answer as a mixed number.

## 4: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level.
Given the detailed thought processes, most students across all levels will likely choose option B, as it's the direct and correct answer given the constraints of the question.

- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might recognize it as a correct calculation but not in mixed form), B=40% (correct but might depend on understanding of mixed numbers), C=10% (possible if they try other denominators), D=30% (common misconception).
- **Basic**: A=15% (calculate correctly but misunderstand format), B=70% (correct understanding and application), C=5% (less likely), D=10% (still some misconceptions).
- **Proficient**: A=10% (know it's correct but not in required format), B=85% (clearly understand and apply correctly), C=3% (minor errors), D=2% (rarely mistaken).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (purely for completeness, knowing it's equivalent), B=90% (understand and apply requirement to leave as mixed number), C=2% (minimal chance), D=3% (understanding is solid, so very rare).

## 5: Format the predicted percentages.
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=85% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
