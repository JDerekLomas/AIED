Based on the provided perspectives, I will analyze and predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option.

**Below Basic:**
At this level, students may struggle with basic algebraic concepts and fraction operations. They might not fully understand the concept of finding a common denominator.

A=60% (some students may arrive at the correct answer through trial and error or by following a simplistic approach, as seen in Perspective 1)
B=30% (students may mistakenly add the denominators and numerators separately, as seen in Perspective 2)
C=5% (unlikely, but some students might incorrectly simplify or manipulate the fractions)
D=5% (unlikely, as students may not consider this option)

**Basic:**
At this level, students have a basic understanding of fraction operations and can apply simple procedures.

A=80% (students may follow a straightforward approach to find the common denominator and add the fractions, as seen in Perspectives 2 and 5)
B=15% (students may still be confused about adding denominators and numerators separately)
C=3% (unlikely, as students may not consider this option)
D=2% (unlikely, as students may not consider this option)

**Proficient:**
At this level, students have a solid understanding of algebraic concepts and can apply them to solve problems.

A=95% (students will confidently and accurately find the common denominator and add the fractions, as seen in Perspectives 1, 3, and 4)
B=4% (students may still make minor mistakes or consider alternative approaches)
C=1% (unlikely, as students will not consider this option)
D=0% (unlikely, as students will not consider this option)

**Advanced:**
At this level, students have a deep understanding of algebraic concepts and can apply them to complex problems.

A=100% (students will accurately and efficiently solve the problem, using a common denominator and adding the fractions)

Given the perspectives, I would predict:

below_basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
proficient: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%

Please note that these predictions are based on the provided perspectives and may not reflect the actual performance of students in a real-world setting.
