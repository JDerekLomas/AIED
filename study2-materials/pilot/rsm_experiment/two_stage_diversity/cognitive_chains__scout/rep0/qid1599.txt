Based on the provided perspectives, here's my analysis:

**below_basic:** 
These students may struggle with algebraic conventions and notation. 
A=60% (some students can pick up on the correct notation through common sense, e.g., 'c' divided by something), 
B=15% (may mistakenly add 4 to c), 
C=15% (may not understand the bracket notation), 
D=10% (swapping the numerator and denominator)

**basic:** 
These students have a basic understanding of algebraic expressions but might make notation errors.
A=80% (most students understand 'c' divided by a quantity), 
B=5% ( incorrect addition), 
C=10% ( struggles with bracket notation), 
D=5% (swapping numerator and denominator)

**proficient:** 
These students are familiar with standard algebraic conventions.
A=95% (mostly confident in writing 'c' divided by (h+4) as a fraction), 
B=0% (uncommon incorrect additions), 
C=3% ( rare cases of misinterpreting bracket notation), 
D=2% (rarely swapping numerator and denominator)

**advanced:** 
These students are highly confident in algebraic manipulations.
A=99% ( extremely confident in conventional notation), 
B=0% (very rare errors), 
C=0.5% ( extremely rare notation errors), 
D=0.5% ( extremely rare mistakes)
