To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the perspectives provided and match them with the typical reasoning and skills expected at different levels of mathematical proficiency.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Perspectives
The question requires evaluating the correctness of two steps in solving an equation: Step 1 transforms \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\) into \(60 = 1 + k\) by multiplying both sides by 4, and Step 2 transforms \(60 = 1 + k\) into \(61 = k\) by adding 1 to both sides. The correct solution for \(k\) would involve recognizing Step 1 as correct (since \(15 \times 4 = 60\)) and then correctly solving for \(k\) in Step 2, which should be \(60 - 1 = 59\), not \(61\).

## 2: Analyzing Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and checking their work. They might not fully understand the process of isolating a variable or might make simple arithmetic errors.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding of algebra but may make mistakes in solving equations, especially if the steps require multiple operations or checking.
- **Proficient:** These students understand algebraic concepts well and can apply them to solve equations but might occasionally make careless mistakes.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebraic concepts and can apply them accurately to solve problems.

## 3: Predicting Responses
Given the perspectives:
- Most students, regardless of level, would recognize Step 1 as correct because it accurately multiplies both sides by 4.
- The confusion arises in Step 2, where students must decide whether to add or subtract 1 from 60 to solve for \(k\).

## 4: Ability Level Predictions
### Below Basic
- A=60% (recognize multiplication but struggle with subtraction/addition step)
- B=10% (unlikely to think only Step 2 is correct without understanding Step 1)
- C=5% (unlikely to think both are correct given the error in Step 2)
- D=25% (might not understand either step)

### Basic
- A=70% (understand Step 1 but may confuse Step 2)
- B=5% (unlikely to isolate Step 2 as correct)
- C=10% (may incorrectly validate both steps)
- D=15% (understand neither step correctly)

### Proficient
- A=80% (strong understanding of Step 1, but some might still err in Step 2)
- B=5%
- C=5% (unlikely to validate both steps with the error apparent)
- D=10%

### Advanced
- A=90% (clear understanding of both steps, recognizing the error in Step 2)
- B=0% (unlikely to consider Step 2 correct in isolation)
- C=0% (recognize the error in Step 2)
- D=10% (a small chance of misunderstanding both, though unlikely)

The best answer is A. 

below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
basic: A=70% B=5% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
