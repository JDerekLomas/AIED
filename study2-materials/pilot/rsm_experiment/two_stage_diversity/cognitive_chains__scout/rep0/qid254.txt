To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the perspectives provided and relate them to common misunderstandings or misconceptions students might have about calculating the mean and the impact of BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction).

## Step 1: Understanding the Calculation of Mean
The mean is calculated by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the count of the numbers. For the given numbers \(0, 1, 3, 4, 7\), the sum is \(0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15\), and there are \(5\) numbers. So, the correct calculation for the mean is \(\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}\) or equivalently \(\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}\), which matches option A.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \(\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}\), essentially includes all numbers except the 0 in the numerator but still divides by 5. Since adding 0 does not change the sum, this option correctly calculates the mean. Most students who understand that the 0 does not contribute to the sum but still counts as one of the numbers for division would choose this.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \(0+1+3+4+7 \div 5\), suggests a misunderstanding of BIDMAS. Following BIDMAS, division before addition would result in \(7 \div 5 = 1.4\), then \(0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1.4 = 9.4\), which is incorrect. This option would likely be chosen by students who are not familiar with BIDMAS or misunderstand its application.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \(\frac{1+3+4+7}{4}\), indicates a student might not count the 0 as one of the numbers for division purposes, which is incorrect. This option would be appealing to students who either do not count the zero or misunderstand the concept of mean.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D, "None of them," would be chosen by students who recognize that the provided options do not accurately represent the correct calculation for the mean.

## 6: Predicting Student Choices by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic calculations and understanding of mean. They might be more prone to choosing B due to a lack of understanding of BIDMAS or C due to not counting the zero properly. A could be tempting for those who see the division by 5 but don't notice the missing 0. D might be chosen by a few who recognize the errors but not correct them.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make errors. A seems correct to them because they see the division by 5. B might confuse them due to BIDMAS. C could be appealing to those ignoring the zero. D could be considered by a few.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of the mean and BIDMAS. They're likely to choose A because they understand the calculation and see that adding 0 doesn't change the sum. B would likely be avoided due to BIDMAS. C might be considered by some who forget to include the zero. D could be for those unsure.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to understand the nuances of each option clearly. They'd choose A as it's effectively correct. B, C, and D would be less appealing due to clear errors or lack of relevance.

## 7: Final Predictions
Assuming students understand the concepts to varying degrees:
- **below_basic:** A=40% (some calculation skills), B=30% (misunderstanding of BIDMAS), C=20% (not counting 0), D=10%
- **basic:** A=60%, B=20%, C=15%, D=5%
- **proficient:** A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%
- **advanced:** A=95%, B=0%, C=0%, D=5%

The final response is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
