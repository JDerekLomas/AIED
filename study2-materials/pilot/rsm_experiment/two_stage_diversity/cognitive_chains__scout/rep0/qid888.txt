## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Perspectives
The question asks students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct answer can be determined using the FOIL method, which stands for First, Outside, Inside, Last. This method yields \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\), simplifying to \(m^2 - 12m + 35\), which corresponds to option B.

## 2: Analyzing Student Perspectives
Each perspective provided shows a student's thought process in approaching the problem. Most students correctly apply the FOIL method and accurately determine the signs and coefficients, leading them to select option B as the correct answer.

## 3: Assessing Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with applying the FOIL method correctly or with handling the signs of the numbers. They might incorrectly calculate the middle term or the constant term.
- **Basic**: Students at this level can apply the FOIL method but may make careless mistakes, such as incorrect sign handling or arithmetic errors.
- **Proficient**: These students understand and correctly apply the FOIL method, are careful with signs and arithmetic, and can accurately simplify the expression.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only correctly apply the FOIL method and simplify the expression but may also do so efficiently and accurately, with a deep understanding of algebraic principles.

## 4: Estimating Student Choices
Based on the perspectives provided and typical student understanding:
- **Below Basic**: May choose A due to incorrect application of FOIL or mistaken calculation of the middle term (e.g., thinking \(-7 + 5 = -2\)), C due to incorrect handling of signs leading to a positive middle term, or D due to mistakenly keeping the negative sign in the constant term. B might be less commonly chosen due to the accuracy required.
- **Basic**: Will likely choose B, as most perspectives that are somewhat accurate lead to B. However, some might choose A due to simple arithmetic mistakes or choosing D if there are sign errors.
- **Proficient**: Will probably choose B, demonstrating a good understanding of the FOIL method and algebraic manipulation. Errors leading to other options might occur but are less common.
- **Advanced**: Will certainly choose B, with a strong and efficient grasp of the algebraic process.

## 5: Predicting Percentages
Given the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: \(A = 40\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(D = 20\%\)
- **Basic**: \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 70\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 5\%\)
- **Proficient**: \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 90\%\), \(C = 3\%\), \(D = 2\%\)
- **Advanced**: \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 98\%\), \(C = 1\%\), \(D = 1\%\)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
