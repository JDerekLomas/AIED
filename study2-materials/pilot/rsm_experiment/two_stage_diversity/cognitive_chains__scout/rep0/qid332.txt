## Step 1: Understand the perspectives provided
The task involves analyzing different perspectives on how students might approach solving the equation $\frac{x}{3}-5=12$. Five detailed perspectives are given, showcasing the thought process of students as they evaluate the correctness of two proposed next lines of working: Tom's $\frac{x}{3}=17$ and Katie's $x-5=36$.

## 2: Identify the correct solution method
To verify Tom's and Katie's methods:
- Tom's method involves adding 5 to both sides of the equation, yielding $\frac{x}{3}=17$. Then, multiplying both sides by 3 gives $x=51$.
- Katie's method involves multiplying every term by 3 to clear the fraction, which should result in $x - 15 = 36$, not $x - 5 = 36$. Thus, Katie's proposed line of working seems incorrect based on the oversight of not multiplying the -5 by 3.

## 3: Analyze student understanding based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and could potentially be misled by incorrect steps or overlook critical details.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make simple mistakes or not fully understand the implications of their steps.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebra and can identify correct and incorrect steps in solving equations.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the algebraic processes but can also critically evaluate different methods and their implications.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the explanations and common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic**: May have difficulty understanding algebraic manipulations, so they might be more likely to choose incorrect options or not understand why one is correct and the other isn't. $A=60%$, $B=20%$, $C=10%$, $D=10%$.
- **Basic**: Have a basic understanding, so they might see Tom's method as clearly correct but be uncertain or mistaken about Katie's. $A=70%$, $B=15%$, $C=10%$, $D=5%$.
- **Proficient**: Understand the algebra well and can see Tom's method is straightforward and correct. They might recognize Katie's mistake. $A=85%$, $B=5%$, $C=5%$, $D=5%$.
- **Advanced**: These students understand both methods' validity or lack thereof and can critically assess them. $A=90%$, $B=0%$, $C=5%$, $D=5%$.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
