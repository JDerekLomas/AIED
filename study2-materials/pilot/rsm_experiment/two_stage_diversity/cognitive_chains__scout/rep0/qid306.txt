To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the perspectives provided and relate them to common misunderstandings and applications of the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule.

## Step 1: Understanding BIDMAS/BODMAS
BIDMAS/BODMAS stands for Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. It is a mnemonic that helps people remember the order of operations in mathematics.

## 2: Analyzing Problem P
For Problem P: \(4 - 5 + 6\), the correct application of BIDMAS/BODMAS when there are no brackets, indices, or division operations, suggests that addition and subtraction are considered equal and are performed from left to right. Therefore, the first calculation should be \(4 - 5\).

## 3: Analyzing Problem Q
For Problem Q: \(4 + 5 \times 6\), according to BIDMAS/BODMAS, multiplication should be performed before addition. Therefore, the first calculation should be \(5 \times 6\).

## 4: Evaluating Student Perspectives
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule or might apply it inconsistently. They might choose options based on simple addition/subtraction or incorrect applications of the rule.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still struggle with applying the rule correctly, especially in cases where operations are of equal precedence.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the rule and can apply it correctly to most problems but might still have some inconsistencies.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the rule but can also apply it accurately and efficiently.

## 5: Predicting Choice Percentages
Given the analysis:
- Option B (\(4-5\) for P and \(5 \times 6\) for Q) reflects the correct application of BIDMAS/BODMAS for both problems.
- Students who understand that for Problem P, operations are performed left to right for \(+\) and \(-\), and for Problem Q, \(5 \times 6\) comes first, will choose B.

## 6: Percentage Predictions
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (simple mistake), B=40% (some understanding), C=20% (confusion), D=20% (misapplication of BIDMAS).
- **Basic**: A=10% (lack of understanding), B=60% (correct application for Q, left to right for P), C=15% (partial understanding), D=15% (incorrect application).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (minor errors), B=80% (accurate application), C=5% (confusion), D=10% (rare misapplication).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (full understanding), B=95% (correct application), C=0% (no confusion), D=5% (extremely rare errors).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
