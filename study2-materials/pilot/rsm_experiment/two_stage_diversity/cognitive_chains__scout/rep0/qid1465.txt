## Step 1: Understanding the Question and BIDMAS Rule
The question requires applying the BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction) rule to solve the expression \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). According to BIDMAS, multiplication should be performed before addition and subtraction.

## 2: Solving the Expression
First, perform the multiplication: \(4 \times 2 = 8\).
Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \(3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6\).
So, the correct answer is \(6\), which corresponds to option A.

## 3: Analyzing Student Perspectives
- Perspective 1: Incorrectly applies BIDMAS and makes calculation errors, ends up with D.
- Perspective 2: Forgets BIDMAS initially, then correctly applies it and gets A.
- Perspective 3: Initially ignores BIDMAS, then applies it and gets A.
- Perspective 4: Questions the order of operations, then correctly applies BIDMAS and gets A.
- Perspective 5: Initially ignores BIDMAS, then applies it and gets A.

## 4: Predicting Student Choices by Ability Level
### Below Basic
Students at this level often struggle with basic arithmetic and applying rules like BIDMAS. They might not correctly apply BIDMAS or make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- A: 40% (some manage to guess or partially understand BIDMAS)
- B: 10% (might misunderstand the multiplication part)
- C: 10% (unlikely but possible due to random guessing)
- D: 40% (common incorrect answer due to not following BIDMAS or miscalculation)

### Basic
Students here have a foundational understanding but may still struggle with applying BIDMAS consistently.
- A: 60% (start to understand and apply BIDMAS)
- B: 10% (misunderstanding of operations)
- C: 5% (unlikely)
- D: 25% (still prone to mistakes)

### Proficient
These students generally understand and can apply BIDMAS.
- A: 80% (correct application of BIDMAS)
- B: 5% (rare misunderstanding)
- C: 5% (unlikely)
- D: 10% (occasional mistake)

### Advanced
Advanced students are expected to consistently and correctly apply mathematical rules.
- A: 95% (strong understanding and application of BIDMAS)
- B: 2% (very rare misunderstanding)
- C: 2% (extremely unlikely)
- D: 1% (exceptional mistake)

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the analysis, the predicted percentages are:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
