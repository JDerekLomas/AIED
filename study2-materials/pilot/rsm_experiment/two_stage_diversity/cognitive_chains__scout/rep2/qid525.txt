To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the perspectives provided and relate them to the typical understanding and common misconceptions students might have at different levels.

## Step 1: Understanding the Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students who struggle with basic concepts and operations.
- **Basic**: Students who have a foundational understanding but may make simple errors.
- **Proficient**: Students who consistently demonstrate a good understanding of concepts.
- **Advanced**: Students with a deep understanding, able to apply concepts to complex problems.

## 2: Analyzing the Question and Common Misconceptions
The question involves adding mixed numbers with different denominators. A common misconception is adding the denominators directly or not converting to a common denominator correctly.

## 3: Evaluating Option Choices
- **A) \( \frac{99}{20} \)**: This is an improper fraction equivalent to \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \), correct but not in mixed number form as requested.
- **B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \)**: The correct answer in mixed number form.
- **C) \( \frac{99}{40} \)**: Incorrect; this would be \( 2 \frac{19}{40} \) and does not correctly represent the solution to the given problem.
- **D) \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \)**: Incorrect; results from adding numerators and denominators separately.

## 4: Predicting Student Choices by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Likely to choose D due to misunderstanding of operations (adding numerators and denominators) or A because they might find improper fractions more comfortable but not converting to mixed numbers properly.
- **Basic**: May still struggle with common denominators and choose D or A due to confusion.
- **Proficient**: Should choose B, as they understand the need for a common denominator and converting to mixed numbers.
- **Advanced**: Will confidently choose B and understand why A, C, and D are incorrect.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Given the insights:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (some understanding of converting but not to mixed numbers), B=20% (correct but might struggle), C=10% (unlikely), D=40% (common misconception).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=60%, C=5%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=90%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=98%, C=1%, D=1%.

## 6: Finalizing Percentages
Considering typical performance and understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
- **Basic**: A=20% B=60% C=5% D=15%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is:
