## Step 1: Analyzing the perspectives for understanding common misconceptions and correct applications of BIDMAS/BODMAS.
Each perspective provided shows a student's thought process in solving the expression \(3-5+4 \times 2\). The correct application of BIDMAS/BODMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) is crucial. Most students recognize the need to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS but may struggle with the execution, especially with negative numbers and the order of operations.

## 2: Identifying the correct answer based on BIDMAS/BODMAS.
The expression to solve is \(3-5+4 \times 2\). Following BIDMAS/BODMAS:
1. Multiply \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Then, \(3 - 5 = -2\)
3. Finally, \(-2 + 8 = 6\)
So, the correct answer is A) \(6\).

## 3: Assessing the below_basic level students' potential answers.
Students at the below_basic level may not fully understand or apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly. They might perform operations from left to right without considering the rules or make significant calculation errors.

## 4: Evaluating the basic level students' potential answers.
Basic level students may have a rudimentary understanding of BIDMAS/BODMAS but might struggle with applying it consistently, especially with negative numbers. They could choose A) \(6\) if they apply the rules correctly but might also be tempted by incorrect calculations or alternative orders of operations.

## 5: Considering the proficient level students' potential answers.
Proficient students are likely to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly and understand how to handle negative numbers. They should predominantly choose A) \(6\).

## 6: Examining the advanced level students' potential answers.
Advanced students not only apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly but also have a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. They are likely to choose A) \(6\) without hesitation and might be less prone to misconceptions.

## 7: Estimating the percentage of students choosing each option at each level.
- **Below_basic**: These students might not apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly. They could be evenly split between incorrect options due to a lack of understanding, so A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here may start to understand BIDMAS/BODMAS but still make errors. A significant portion might choose A) \(6\), but there could be a noticeable number choosing other options due to confusion, so A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students should mostly apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly, so A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are expected to almost universally apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly, so A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
