To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the perspectives provided and relate them to common misconceptions and understanding of fraction addition.

## Step 1: Understanding Fraction Addition
To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. The correct process involves finding a common denominator, converting each fraction to have this common denominator, and then adding the numerators.

## 2: Analyzing Common Misconceptions
- A common misconception is adding the denominators directly when they are not the same, instead of finding a common denominator.
- Another misconception is adding the numerators and denominators separately.

## 3: Relating Perspectives to Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of adding fractions with different denominators. They might simply add the numerators and denominators (leading to B: \( \frac{7}{3x} \)) or not fully grasp the concept of common denominators.
- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding but might struggle with applying the rules correctly. They might recognize the need for a common denominator but struggle with the execution or fall into common misconceptions like adding denominators.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the need for a common denominator and can apply it correctly. They are less likely to fall into basic misconceptions.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the process but can also simplify and apply it efficiently.

## 4: Predicting Student Choices
- **Option A (\( \frac{11}{2x} \)):** This is the correct answer. Students who understand the concept of finding a common denominator and adding fractions correctly will choose this.
- **Option B (\( \frac{7}{3x} \)):** This results from incorrectly adding both the numerators and denominators. Students who misunderstand the concept of adding fractions might choose this.
- **Option C (\( \frac{11}{x} \)):** This might seem like a plausible incorrect answer, but it's not directly suggested by the common misconceptions outlined. It implies multiplying the first fraction by a certain factor to make denominators equal but not correctly executed.
- **Option D (\( \frac{7}{2x} \)):** This could be chosen by students who add the numerators but not the denominators correctly or misunderstand the process.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the understanding and common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic:** Likely to choose B due to direct addition of numerators and denominators (40%), A if they manage to stumble upon the correct process or are guided towards it (30%), and D or C due to other misunderstandings (30%).
- **Basic:** More likely to choose A as they start to grasp the concept (60%), but still some chance of choosing B or D due to lingering misconceptions (B=20%, D=10%, C=10%).
- **Proficient:** Mostly A (80%), with some chance of B or D if they slip up on the details (B=10%, D=5%, C=5%).
- **Advanced:** Almost exclusively A (95%), with a small chance of errors leading to B or D (B=3%, D=2%).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
