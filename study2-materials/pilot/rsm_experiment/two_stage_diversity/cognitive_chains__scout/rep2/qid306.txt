## Step 1: Analyzing the question and the given perspectives
The question asks to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for the given problems P and Q. The problems are:
- Problem P: \( 4 - 5 + 6 \)
- Problem Q: \( 4 + 5 \times 6 \)

## 2: Understanding BIDMAS/BODMAS rules
BIDMAS (or BODMAS) is a mnemonic that helps remember the order of operations in mathematics: Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. For Problem P, there are no brackets, indices, division, or multiplication, so the relevant operations are addition and subtraction. For Problem Q, there is multiplication and addition.

## 3: Applying BIDMAS to Problem P
In Problem P, \( 4 - 5 + 6 \), according to BIDMAS, addition and subtraction have equal priority and are performed from left to right. So, the correct order is to do \( 4 - 5 \) first, resulting in \( -1 \), then \( -1 + 6 = 5 \).

## 4: Applying BIDMAS to Problem Q
In Problem Q, \( 4 + 5 \times 6 \), multiplication comes before addition according to BIDMAS. So, the correct order is to do \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) first, then \( 4 + 30 = 34 \).

## 5: Evaluating student perspectives
- Students often get confused with the order of operations, especially when operations have equal priority (like addition and subtraction).
- The correct approach for Problem P is to do \( 4 - 5 \) first (Option A), and for Problem Q, \( 5 \times 6 \) first (Option B).

## 6: Predicting student choices based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: These students might not fully understand BIDMAS or might apply it incorrectly. They could choose any option based on misunderstanding or lack of knowledge.
- **Basic**: Basic level students might understand the concept but apply it inconsistently. They might be swayed by the apparent complexity of operations.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students have a good grasp of BIDMAS and can apply it correctly. They are likely to choose Option B.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand BIDMAS but also can reason about the equality of operations with the same precedence. They would confidently choose the correct option.

## 7: Estimating percentages
Given the perspectives:
- **Below_basic**: Might not understand BIDMAS properly, could randomly select, so A=20%, B=30%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Basic**: Starting to understand, but may get confused, so A=30%, B=40%, C=15%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: Understand BIDMAS well, so A=10%, B=70%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: Fully grasp BIDMAS and its implications, so A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.

## 8: Finalizing predictions
Based on typical student understanding and common misconceptions:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
- proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
- advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
