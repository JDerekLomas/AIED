To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the perspectives provided and relate them to common misunderstandings or areas of difficulty in calculating the mean.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to calculate the mean of the numbers 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. The correct formula for the mean is the sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers. Therefore, the correct calculation is \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \).

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). This option correctly divides by 5 (the total count of numbers) but omits the 0 from the sum. However, since adding 0 does not change the sum, this option effectively calculates the correct mean.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \). This option incorrectly suggests performing the division before adding the numbers due to BIDMAS/BODMAS rules, which would lead to an incorrect result.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \). This option incorrectly divides by 4 instead of 5 and also omits the 0 from the sum.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D states "None of them," which would only be correct if none of the provided calculations resulted in the correct mean.

## 6: Relating to Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of mathematical concepts. They might choose Option C due to a lack of understanding of how to count the numbers correctly or Option B due to misapplication of BIDMAS/BODMAS without considering the context.

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may make simple errors. They might lean towards Option A because it looks like a formula for mean but doesn't account for the zero explicitly, or they might be misled by Option B.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the concept of mean and can apply it. They are likely to choose Option A because they recognize that adding 0 doesn't change the sum, and they see that dividing by 5 is correct.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the concept but can also analyze and evaluate different expressions. They are likely to immediately recognize Option A as correct due to its effective inclusion of all numbers (through omission of 0, which doesn't contribute to the sum) and correct division by 5.

## 7: Prediction
Given the perspectives:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (recognize the formula but with errors), B=30% (misunderstand BIDMAS), C=25% (counting error), D=5% (lack of confidence in any option).
- **Basic:** A=60% (correct formula essentially), B=20% (BIDMAS confusion), C=15% (basic error), D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=80% (comfort with formula), B=10% (occasional mistake), C=5% (rare mistake), D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=95% (confident in correct formula), B=3% (minimal errors), C=1% (rare), D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=25% D=5%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
