To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the perspectives provided and relate them to common misconceptions and understanding in mathematics, particularly in solving equations.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task involves evaluating the steps taken by Isaac to solve the equation \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\). The correct steps involve multiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, yielding \(60 = 1 + k\), and then subtracting 1 from both sides to solve for \(k\), resulting in \(k = 59\). Isaac's steps are: Step 1) \(60 = 1 + k\), which is correct, and Step 2) \(61 = k\), which is incorrect.

## 2: Analyzing Student Perspectives
- **Perspective 1** correctly identifies Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect, concluding that only Step 1 is correct (Option A).
- **Perspective 2** incorrectly validates both steps as correct (Option C).
- **Perspective 3** correctly identifies Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect, choosing Option A.
- **Perspective 4** also correctly identifies Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect, choosing Option A.
- **Perspective 5** incorrectly validates both steps as correct (Option C).

## 3: Ability Levels and Expected Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not fully understand how to isolate \(k\) or may make simple arithmetic errors. Expect a high percentage to choose incorrectly, possibly scattering across B, C, or D due to confusion.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make errors in solving equations. They might correctly identify Step 1 but struggle with Step 2, or they might not fully grasp the operations needed. Expect a significant percentage to choose A, with some choosing C due to misunderstanding the operations.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebra and should easily identify Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect, leading them to choose Option A. There's less likelihood of choosing C or B, and D if they understand the process.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will undoubtedly choose Option A, as they have a deep understanding of algebraic manipulations and can easily verify the correctness of Step 1 and the incorrectness of Step 2.

## 4: Predicting Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: May have difficulty, likely to choose D (not understanding either step) or scatter across options. A=20%, B=10%, C=30%, D=40%
- **Basic**: Starting to understand algebraic manipulations, might see A as a plausible answer but could be swayed by confusion. A=40%, B=15%, C=25%, D=20%
- **Proficient**: Solid understanding, likely to choose A. A=70%, B=5%, C=15%, D=10%
- **Advanced**: Confident in their algebraic skills, choose A. A=90%, B=0%, C=5%, D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=15% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
