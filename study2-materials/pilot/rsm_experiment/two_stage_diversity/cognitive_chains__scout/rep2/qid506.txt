## Step 1: Analyzing the Perspectives
The given perspectives illustrate various thought processes students might use to solve the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\). Most students correctly identify that to isolate \(p\), they need to divide both sides by 3, leading to \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\). The challenge arises in how they perform this division with fractions.

## 2: Understanding Common Misconceptions
A common misconception seems to be not properly applying the division of fractions, which involves multiplying by the reciprocal of the divisor (Keep, Change, Flip method). Some students mistakenly calculate \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\) as \(p = \frac{1}{4}\) or get confused about how the division affects the numerator and denominator.

## 3: Evaluating Option A (\( p = \frac{1}{4} \))
Option A, \(p = \frac{1}{4}\), appears to be a tempting incorrect answer. This might occur if a student incorrectly simplifies \(\frac{1}{12} \div 3\) by only considering \(12 \div 3 = 4\) without applying the correct fraction division rules.

## 4: Evaluating Option B (\( p = \frac{1}{36} \))
Option B, \(p = \frac{1}{36}\), is the correct answer. Students who correctly apply the division of fractions (using the Keep, Change, Flip method) or logically deduce that dividing \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3 results in a smaller fraction, with the denominator being \(12 \times 3 = 36\), will choose this option.

## 5: Evaluating Option C (\( p = 4 \))
Option C, \(p = 4\), seems highly unlikely as it does not logically follow from common mistakes in solving the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\).

## 6: Evaluating Option D (\( p = \frac{1}{9} \))
Option D, \(p = \frac{1}{9}\), does not directly relate to common simplifications or mistakes observed in the provided perspectives.

## 7: Predicting Student Choices by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle significantly with fraction operations and algebraic manipulation. They are more likely to choose incorrect options due to a lack of understanding of both fractions and algebra. Option A (\(p = \frac{1}{4}\)) might appeal due to simplistic division, and there might be a higher chance of selecting C or D due to confusion.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still make errors, especially with fraction division. They are likely to choose B but might also consider A.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the concepts but may still make occasional errors. They are likely to choose B, with a lower chance of choosing A or other options.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are expected to have a strong grasp of both algebraic manipulation and fraction operations, making B the most likely choice with minimal errors.

## 8: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis, and without specific data on student performance, we can make educated guesses:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (due to simplistic errors), B=20% (some understanding but easily misled), C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** A=20%, B=70%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=90%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=98%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
