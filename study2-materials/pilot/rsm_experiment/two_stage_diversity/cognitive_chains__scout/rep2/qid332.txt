## Step 1: Analyzing the Question and Perspectives
The question presents a mathematical equation and two proposed next lines of working by Tom and Katie. The task is to evaluate who is correct based on standard algebraic manipulation rules.

## 2: Understanding Algebraic Manipulation Rules
To solve the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\), one can either add 5 to both sides to isolate \(\frac{x}{3}\) (Tom's approach) or multiply every term by 3 to clear the fraction (Katie's approach). Tom's approach yields \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), and then \(x = 51\). Katie's approach, if done correctly, should yield \(x - 15 = 36\), and then \(x = 51\).

## 3: Evaluating Tom's Approach
Tom adds 5 to both sides of the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\), resulting in \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This is a valid step according to algebraic rules.

## 4: Evaluating Katie's Approach
Katie multiplies both sides by 3, which gives \(x - 5 = 36\). However, she forgot to multiply the -5 by 3, which should result in \(x - 15 = 36\). Thus, Katie's approach as stated is incorrect.

## 5: Assessing Student Understanding at Different Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and might not fully understand the implications of each step. They might choose an option based on superficial understanding or guesswork. Given the straightforward nature of Tom's correct solution and the obvious mistake in Katie's provided line, a significant portion might recognize Tom's correctness but struggle with Katie's validity.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding of algebra. They should recognize Tom's approach as correct. However, their understanding of Katie's mistake might vary, potentially leading to a higher percentage choosing only Tom.

- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand algebraic rules and can apply them accurately. They will recognize Tom's approach as correct and Katie's as incorrect due to the omission of multiplying -5 by 3.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the algebraic manipulations but can also provide detailed explanations. They will clearly see Tom's approach as correct and Katie's as incomplete.

## 6: Predicting Percentage Choices
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=70% (recognize Tom's correctness), B=10% (might mistakenly think Katie's approach is sometimes valid), C=5% (unlikely to see both as correct given the mistake), D=15% (might not understand either approach).
- **Basic**: A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=90%, B=0%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=95%, B=0%, C=5%, D=0%.

The best answer is 
below_basic: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
basic: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
