Analyzing the perspectives provided, it's clear that the students are grappling with the concept of multiplying negative numbers and applying the FOIL method for expanding brackets. The correct answer is A) \( +4 \), which results from multiplying -1 and -4.

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the operations with negative numbers or the FOIL method. They might get confused between addition and multiplication or forget the rule about two negatives making a positive. Given the perspectives, it seems some students are inclined towards incorrect options due to misunderstanding.
  - A=60% (Those who manage to recall the rule about two minuses making a plus or get it through trial and error with options)
  - B=20% (Confusion about negative times negative)
  - C=5% (Adding instead of multiplying, or incorrect recall of operations)
  - D=15% (Adding instead of multiplying)

- **Basic:** At this level, students have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with applying rules consistently.
  - A=80% (Better understanding of the rule that two minuses make a plus)
  - B=10% (Some still confused about operations with negatives)
  - C=5% (Occasional mistake of adding)
  - D=5% (Rarely, might consider adding or misapply rules)

- **Proficient:** Students here have a good grasp of the concepts and are less likely to make errors in applying the FOIL method or handling negative numbers.
  - A=95% (Solid understanding of FOIL and negative number multiplication)
  - B=3% (Unlikely to choose incorrect options due to better conceptual understanding)
  - C=1% (Very rarely might confuse with addition)
  - D=1% (Similarly, very rarely might confuse operations)

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately and efficiently.
  - A=100% (Confident and accurate application of FOIL and multiplication of negatives)
  - B=0%
  - C=0%
  - D=0%

Therefore, the predicted percentages are:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
