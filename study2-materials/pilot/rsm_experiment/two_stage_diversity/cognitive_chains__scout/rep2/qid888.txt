## Step 1: Analyzing the Perspectives
The given perspectives illustrate various students' thought processes while solving the problem of expanding \((m-5)(m-7)\). Most students correctly applied the FOIL method (Firsts, Outers, Inners, Lasts) and accurately handled the signs.

## 2: Identifying Common Mistakes
Common mistakes or areas of confusion include:
- Incorrectly calculating the middle term: Some students mistakenly added or subtracted the coefficients of \(m\) incorrectly, but this was a minor issue.
- Handling the constant term: A few students initially questioned whether the product of two negative numbers is positive or negative.

## 3: Categorizing Students by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students who struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and may not fully understand the FOIL method or handling of negative signs.
- **Basic**: Students who understand the FOIL method but may make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- **Proficient**: Students who consistently apply the FOIL method correctly and handle signs appropriately.
- **Advanced**: Students who not only apply the method correctly but also do so efficiently and with a deep understanding of algebraic principles.

## 4: Predicting Student Choices by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: These students are more likely to make significant errors. Option A (\(m^2 - 2m - 35\)) might appeal to those who miscalculate the middle term or the constant term. Option D (\(m^2 - 12m - 35\)) could be chosen by those who forget that two negatives make a positive. Option C (\(m^2 + 12m + 35\)) might be selected by students who mistakenly add the \(m\) coefficients or misinterpret the signs.
- **Basic**: Students at this level may still struggle with the calculation, potentially leaning towards incorrect options due to minor mistakes. They are likely to choose B but may also consider A or D due to simple arithmetic errors.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to choose B (\(m^2 - 12m + 35\)) correctly as they understand the FOIL method and sign rules. Mistakes are less common but could lead to choosing A or D.
- **Advanced**: These students will confidently choose B, with minimal chance of error.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (common mistake in middle term), B=40% (partial understanding), C=15% (misunderstanding of signs and addition), D=15% (misunderstanding of constant term).
- **Basic**: A=15%, B=70%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95%, C=2%, D=3%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2% D=3%
