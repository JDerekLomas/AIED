## Step 1: Analyzing the Question and Perspectives
The question requires students to compare the values of two expressions: $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$, and then determine which symbol ($\rangle$, $\langle$, $=$, or $\geq$) belongs in the box between them. The correct solution involves applying the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), which dictates that division comes before addition in the first expression, resulting in $8 + 3 = 11$. For the second expression, brackets are evaluated first, yielding $(8+12) = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$. Therefore, the first expression equals 11 and the second equals 5, making the correct symbol $\rangle$.

## 2: Understanding Student Perspectives
The provided perspectives showcase various thought processes and potential pitfalls students might encounter, such as misapplying the order of operations, confusing the direction of the inequality symbol, or making calculation errors. Most perspectives, however, eventually arrive at the correct calculation of 11 for the left expression and 5 for the right expression, leading to the conclusion that $11 > 5$.

## 3: Assessing Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with applying the order of operations or understanding the question. They might incorrectly calculate or compare the numbers.
- **Basic**: These students understand the basic concepts but might make simple errors in calculation or in applying rules like BIDMAS.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students are expected to accurately apply the order of operations and correctly compare the values.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only accurately solve the problem but may also show a deeper understanding of the concepts and be less likely to make careless mistakes.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
Given the nature of the question and the common pitfalls:
- **Below Basic**: Likely to have a high percentage choosing incorrect options due to misunderstandings of BIDMAS or calculation errors. $A$ might not be as high as in other categories because these students might not accurately solve the expressions.
- **Basic**: As students improve, they are more likely to choose $A$ ($>$) but might still have some confusion, leading to a notable percentage for $B$ ($<$) or $C$ ($=$).
- **Proficient**: A high percentage of these students should choose $A$ ($>$) as they understand BIDMAS and can compare the values correctly.
- **Advanced**: Almost all of these students will choose $A$ ($>$) with minimal error, as they have a strong grasp of the concepts.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: Given the struggle with basic concepts, let's assume $A=50\%$, $B=20\%$, $C=20\%$, $D=10\%$.
- **Basic**: With some understanding but potential for errors, $A=70\%$, $B=15\%$, $C=10\%$, $D=5\%$.
- **Proficient**: Accurate application of concepts, $A=85\%$, $B=5\%$, $C=5\%$, $D=5\%$.
- **Advanced**: High accuracy, $A=95\%$, $B=0\%$, $C=0\%$, $D=5\%$.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
