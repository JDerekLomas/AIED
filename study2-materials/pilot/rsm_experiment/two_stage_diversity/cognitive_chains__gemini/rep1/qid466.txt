As a Year 9 maths teacher, I see this specific question as a classic "distractor" trap. It tests three distinct skills: knowledge of reciprocals, multiplying fractions, and the rules of directed numbers (negative signs).

Students often over-rely on the rule "to get 1, multiply by the negative reciprocal," forgetting that if the target is **-1** rather than **+1**, they only need a single negative sign in the equation.

Here is my prediction of the percentage breakdown based on common classroom misconceptions:

**below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%**
Students at this level often guess or pick numbers that look familiar. Many will see the $\frac{3}{4}$ and simply pick C or D because they don't associate the "flip" (reciprocal) with the number 1. Those who do remember the "flip" often fall for the "change the sign" rule incorrectly, leading them to B.

**basic: A=40% B=40% C=10% D=10%**
These students generally understand that the fraction needs to be "flipped" to get 1. However, this level is where the "sign error" is most prevalent. Many have been taught "negative reciprocal" in the context of perpendicular lines or dividing fractions and will reflexively choose B, thinking they must flip both the fraction and the sign.

**proficient: A=75% B=20% C=3% D=2%**
Proficient students will check their signs. Like the students in the perspectives provided, they will initially hesitate between A and B, but they have the algebraic fluency to test the result: $(- \times - = +)$. Most will correctly identify that they only need one minus sign to keep the result negative.

**advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%**
Advanced students see this as a simple rearrangement ($x = -1 \div -3/4$) or instantly recognise that the product of a negative and a positive is a negative. The 5% for B allows for "silly mistakes" made under exam pressure.

**Final predicted distribution:**

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=40% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=20% C=05% D=00%
advanced: A=95% B=05% C=00% D=00%
