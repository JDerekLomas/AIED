Based on the thought processes shown in the five perspectives, it is clear that many students initially fall into the "intuitive" trap of dividing 12 by 3 to get 4, but many Year 9 students are now developing the self-checking skills (sense-checking the size of the fraction or using 'Keep, Change, Flip') to correct themselves. 

The most common distractor is A, stemming from the simple division of the denominator. Option D is a rarer error involving "moving" the 3 and subtracting it from 12 or misunderstanding the relationship between 3 and 12. Option C is a fundamental misunderstanding of the fraction entirely.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=45% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=75% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=5% B=94% C=0% D=1%
