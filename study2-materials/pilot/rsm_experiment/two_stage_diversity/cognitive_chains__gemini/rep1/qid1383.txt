As a Year 9 maths teacher, I see this specific problem every year. It is a classic "substitution with negatives" trap. Even though many students can correctly identify that $3^4 = 81$, the cognitive conflict between the mathematical rule (even powers of negatives are positive) and the "visual" appearance of the negative sign (or incorrect calculator use) often leads to a high number of errors.

Here is the breakdown of how different ability levels typically perform on this mock exam question:

**below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%**
Students at this level often struggle with the definition of an index/power. Many will simply perform the operation $3 \times 4$ or $-3 \times 4$, leading them to options B and D. Those who do recognize it as multiplication will often lose track of the signs entirely or guess based on the "initial" negative.

**basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%**
Students at this level usually know that $k^4$ means $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$. However, they are highly susceptible to the "it looks negative, so it stays negative" fallacy. Many will use a calculator without brackets (typing $-3^4$), which outputs $-81$, confirming their bias. This group is the most likely to choose C.

**proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%**
These students generally understand the rule for even/odd powers. They can work out $27 \times 3$ correctly and know that an even number of negative signs results in a positive. However, a significant minority will still second-guess themselves or fall victim to "calculator error" as described above, leading to a lingering preference for C.

**advanced: A=92% B=0% C=8% D=0%**
Most advanced Year 9 students will substitute with brackets mentally or on paper, writing $(-3)^4$. They are well-drilled in the fact that any real number raised to an even power is non-negative. The few who miss this usually do so due to extreme over-speeding or a very specific misinterpretation of the notation.

basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=0% C=8% D=0%
