Based on my experience marking Year 9 mock papers and analyzing these specific student thought processes, here is the predicted breakdown of responses by ability level. 

Students at lower levels often struggle with the "numerator/denominator" order or fail to recognize the grouping function of the fraction bar (vinculum) in place of brackets. High-ability students almost universally recognize algebraic conventions regarding division.

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=65% B=5% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=8% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
