In this Year 9 mock exam context, we analyze student errors based on common misconceptions: the "add across" error (D), the failure to convert an improper fraction back to a mixed number despite the prompt (A), and calculation errors or incorrect denominators (C).

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses across the four ability levels:

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=25% D=45%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=95% C=0% D=0%
