Based on my experience marking Year 9 mock exams, this question is a classic test of BIDMAS (Order of Operations) versus "left-to-right" intuition. While the perspectives provided show a high level of self-correction, in a real exam environment, many students—particularly at lower ability levels—fail to re-evaluate their initial instinct.

Here is the predicted distribution of answers:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
**Reasoning:** Many students at this level calculate both sides from left to right (ignoring BIDMAS on the left), resulting in $20 \div 4 = 5$ for both. This leads them strongly toward option C.

basic: A=55% B=10% C=30% D=5%
**Reasoning:** Students here usually recall the acronym "BIDMAS" but may apply it inconsistently. While many will correctly identify that the left side is 11 and the right is 5, a significant portion will still lapse into the "left-to-right" habit or get the inequality symbol pointing the wrong way.

proficient: A=85% B=5% C=8% D=2%
**Reasoning:** Most students at this level have mastered the order of operations and are confident with inequality symbols. Errors here are usually due to "silly" arithmetic mistakes (e.g., $12 \div 4 = 4$) or misreading the question.

advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
**Reasoning:** For high-achieving Year 9s, this is a very straightforward 1-mark question. Only the most hurried student would make a clerical error here.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
basic: A=55% B=10% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
