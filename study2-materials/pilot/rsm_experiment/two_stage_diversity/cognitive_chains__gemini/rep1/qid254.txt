Based on the thought processes demonstrated in the perspectives, this question is a classic "trap" regarding the properties of zero in data sets and the correct notation for order of operations (BIDMAS).

**Below Basic** students often forget that 0 counts as a data point when determining the denominator. They are also highly susceptible to Option B because it looks like a "list" of the numbers they see.

**Basic** students generally know the rule for the mean but struggle with mathematical notation. They often overlook the BIDMAS error in Option B or choose C because they intuitively feel 0 "doesn't count" as a value.

**Proficient** students (like those in the provided perspectives) have the logic to see that 0 doesn't change the sum. They correctly identify the denominator as 5 and recognise that Option B is mathematically incorrect due to the order of operations, leading them to settle on A as the only mathematically sound expression.

**Advanced** students will recognise that while A is mathematically equivalent to the correct answer, the "perfect" formal expression ($\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$) is missing. Some may choose D out of rigour, but most will identify A as the correct calculation.

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=35% D=5%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=85% B=0% C=5% D=10%
