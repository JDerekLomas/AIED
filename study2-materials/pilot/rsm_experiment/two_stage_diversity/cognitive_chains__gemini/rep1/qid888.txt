As an experienced teacher, I have marked thousands of these "expanding double brackets" questions. In Year 9, the main "distractors" here revolve around directed number rules—specifically the difference between adding/subtracting negatives and multiplying them.

**Perspective 1, 2, 3, and 5** represent students who are solidifying their "directed number" rules. They often initially struggle with the signs but usually self-correct to the right answer. **Perspective 4** shows the common pitfall where a student might hesitate on the $-5 \times -7$ operation.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on typical Year 9 mock exam data:

**below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=20% D=30%**
Students at this level often treat $-7 - 5$ as a subtraction that moves towards zero (getting $-2m$, hence Option A). They also frequently struggle with the concept that a negative times a negative produces a positive, often leading them to Option D.

**basic: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%**
These students usually remember FOIL or the Grid Method but make "sign errors." Many will correctly find $12m$ but may end with $-35$ (Option D) because they see two minus signs in the question and assume the answer stays negative.

**proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%**
Proficient students are generally secure with $m^2$ and $35$. Their main risk is a "slip" on the middle term or a momentary lapse in sign rules. Most will arrive at B after self-correcting their mental number line, much like the students in the perspectives provided.

**advanced: A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%**
Advanced students perform these expansions almost automatically. Errors here would be rare "calculator-brain" slips or reading the question too quickly.

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=05% B=80% C=05% D=10%
advanced: A=01% B=97% C=01% D=01%
