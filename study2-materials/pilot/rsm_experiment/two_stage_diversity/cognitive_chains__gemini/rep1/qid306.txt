As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen this exact misconception year after year. It stems from a "shallow" understanding of the BIDMAS/BODMAS acronym. Students often treat it as a strict 6-step hierarchy rather than realizing that Division/Multiplication and Addition/Subtraction are "equal-priority" pairs that should be processed left-to-right.

Problem P is the "trap." Students who strictly follow the letters (A before S) will erroneously choose $5+6$ (often ignoring the negative sign attached to the 5). Problem Q is a more standard test of the order of operations where M does indeed come before A.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses for Year 9:

**below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=25% D=20%**
Students at this level often ignore BIDMAS entirely, preferring to work left-to-right for every problem (Option A). Some may pick C because they recognize the "plus" and "multiply" signs but don't apply order of operations correctly.

**basic: A=10% B=30% C=10% D=50%**
This group is the most likely to fall into the "BIDMAS Trap." They have been taught the acronym and follow it literally. They know multiplication comes before addition (correctly identifying $5 \times 6$ for Q), but they also believe addition must strictly come before subtraction (incorrectly identifying $5+6$ for P).

**proficient: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%**
These students are beginning to understand that Addition and Subtraction are equal priority. Many will correctly process P from left-to-right (Option B). However, under exam pressure, a significant minority will still default to the literal acronym order (Option D).

**advanced: A=2% B=92% C=1% D=5%**
Advanced students understand the grouping of DM and AS. They recognize that $4 - 5 + 6$ is effectively $4 + (-5) + 6$. They will almost universally choose Option B, though a tiny percentage might overthink the question or make a clerical error.

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=10% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=2% B=92% C=1% D=5%
