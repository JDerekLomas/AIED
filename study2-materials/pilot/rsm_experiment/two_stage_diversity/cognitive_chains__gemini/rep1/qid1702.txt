To predict these percentages, we must consider the common pitfalls for Year 9 students: 
1. **Rearranging Equations:** Many students struggle with the "inverse operation" (adding 3 vs. subtracting 3). This leads directly to choice **D (2.7)**.
2. **Substitution Errors:** Some students may swap $x$ and $y$, solving $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$, leading to $5 - 6y = 30 \rightarrow -6y = 25 \rightarrow y = -4.16...$ (often rounded or miscalculated to **B**).
3. **Calculation Errors:** Using the wrong operation or misplaced decimals leads to **A** or **B**.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock exam trends:

below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=50% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%
