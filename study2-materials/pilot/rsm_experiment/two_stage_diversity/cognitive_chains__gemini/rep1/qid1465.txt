Based on the thought processes shown in the five perspectives—where students grapple with the conflict between "left-to-right" calculation and BIDMAS, as well as the common struggle with directed numbers (negative integers)—here is the predicted breakdown for a Year 9 cohort:

**below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%**
Students at this level almost always work left-to-right (3 - 5 = -2; -2 + 4 = 2; 2 * 2 = 4), leading to B. Those who remember "Multiplication first" often struggle with the directed number part (3 - 13 = -10), leading to D, or make sign errors leading to C.

**basic: A=50% B=25% C=5% D=20%**
Students here are aware of BIDMAS (as seen in the perspectives) but are prone to the "Addition before Subtraction" trap (treating 5+8 as 13, then 3-13 = -10). They often self-correct from B to A after remembering the rule, but their number line work is inconsistent.

**proficient: A=85% B=5% C=0% D=10%**
Proficient students consistently apply BIDMAS correctly. The small percentage of D reflects the common misconception that Addition must be performed before Subtraction (3 - [5+8]) rather than treating addition and subtraction as equal priority from left to right.

**advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%**
Advanced students treat the expression as $3 - 5 + 8$ or $3 + (-5) + 8$. Mistakes at this level are usually rare "slip of the pen" errors rather than conceptual misunderstandings.
