Based on the thought processes shown in the perspectives provided—which highlight a common misconception where students correctly identify the first inverse operation (multiplication) but fail to correctly apply the second (subtraction)—here is the predicted breakdown of student responses for a Year 9 mock exam:

**Below Basic:**
Students at this level often struggle with the order of operations or basic arithmetic. Many may think the '4' should be subtracted or the '1' should be moved first, leading to Step 1 being seen as wrong. Others may see "61" and simply guess that "adding feels right."
below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%

**Basic:**
These students usually recognize the first step of "clearing the fraction" by multiplying. However, they frequently make the "sign change" error shown in the perspectives, believing that moving a number to the other side of the equals sign simply means "performing an operation," often defaulting to addition.
basic: A=55% B=10% C=25% D=10%

**Proficient:**
Proficient students are the target demographic for the provided perspectives. They can accurately perform $15 \times 4$ and recognize that Step 1 is correct. While some may still lapse and think $60+1=61$ in the heat of an exam, most will use substitution (as seen in Perspective 5) to realize that $61+1 \neq 60$.
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%

**Advanced:**
Advanced students will immediately see the inverse operation required in Step 2 is subtraction ($60 - 1 = 59$). They will identify the mistake in Step 2 instantly and confirm that only Step 1 is logically sound.
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
