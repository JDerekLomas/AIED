As a teacher marking Year 9 mock exams, I often see that while students may know the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), their execution of decimal multiplication and the application of indices to coefficients is where the differentiation occurs.

**Perspective Breakdown:**
- **The "Order of Operations" trap:** Students who calculate $(3 \times 0.3)^2$ will arrive at **A (0.81)**. This is a very common error for Basic and Below Basic students.
- **The "Decimal Squaring" trap:** Many students think $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. If they then multiply by 3, they get **D (2.7)**.
- **The "Linear/Addition" trap:** Students who confuse $x^2$ with $x \times 2$ will calculate $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$, leading them to **C (1.8)**.
- **Successful Application:** Students who correctly square $0.3$ to get $0.09$ and then multiply by $3$ arrive at **B (0.27)**.

Based on typical Year 9 cohort data, here is the predicted percentage distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=20% B=65% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=92% C=1% D=2%
