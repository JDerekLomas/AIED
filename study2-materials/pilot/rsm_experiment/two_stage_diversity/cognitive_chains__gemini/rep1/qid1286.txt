Based on the five perspectives provided and typical Year 9 mock exam performance patterns regarding formula manipulation (changing the subject), here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

**below_basic: A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%**
Students at this level often struggle with the mechanics of fractions. Many will incorrectly multiply by the numerator or leave the $4$ on top simply because it was "already high up." Perspective 5 highlights the potential confusion about whether the 3 ends up on the top or bottom. A and B are common distractors for students who don't perform the inverse operations in the correct order.

**basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%**
As seen in Perspectives 1, 2, and 4, basic-level students usually know the volume formula (or can recall it with some doubt). They understand the need for a cube root, but mistakes often occur when "flipping" the fraction or deciding whether to divide by $\pi$ or multiply by it. C is the most frequent choice here, but many will fall into the trap of option B by losing track of the denominator.

**proficient: A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%**
Proficient students, like those in Perspectives 3 and 4, follow a logical step-by-step process: multiplying by 3, dividing by $4\pi$, and then taking the cube root. They are less likely to choose D because they understand that the root must apply to the entire expression, not just the $V$. Most will arrive at C, with a few making a "balancing" error that leads to B.

**advanced: A=2% B=3% C=95% D=0%**
Advanced students will immediately recognize the standard rearrangement of the sphere volume formula. They will perform the inverse operations mentally or with minimal steps and will correctly identify that the $\sqrt[3]{}$ must encompass the entire RHS. C is the dominant answer, with errors being rare and usually down to simple misreads.
