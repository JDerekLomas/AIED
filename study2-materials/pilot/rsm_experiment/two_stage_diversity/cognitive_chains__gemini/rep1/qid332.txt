As a teacher marking these papers, it is clear that this question targets a classic "misconception" regarding the distributive property when multiplying equations with fractions. 

Most students recognise Tom's approach (isolating the fraction first) as the "standard" method taught in UK classrooms. Katie’s error—multiplying the variable and the result but failing to multiply the constant term (-5)—is one of the most common mistakes seen in Year 9 algebra.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on these perspectives:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
**Analysis:** These students often struggle with multi-step processes. Many will see Katie’s $12 \times 3 = 36$ and assume it’s correct because "doing the opposite" is a known rule, without checking the middle term. Option C is a common trap here.

basic: A=65% B=10% C=20% D=5%
**Analysis:** Students at this level are generally comfortable with "moving and changing" (the balancing method). Most will identify Tom as correct. However, a significant minority will still be seduced by Katie's logic because $12 \times 3$ is mathematically correct in isolation, leading them to choose C.

proficient: A=85% B=5% C=8% D=2%
**Analysis:** These students, like those in the provided perspectives, have the algebraic fluency to "test" the numbers or check the distribution. They will recognise that if Katie multiplies by 3, she must multiply every term. Most will confidently select A.

advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
**Analysis:** Advanced students will instantly see Katie’s violation of the distributive law. They may briefly consider if there is a niche way Katie could be right, but will quickly conclude she simply missed a term. Option A is the near-unanimous choice.
