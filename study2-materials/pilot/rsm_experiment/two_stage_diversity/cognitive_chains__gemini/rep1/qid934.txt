Based on the five perspectives provided, which highlight common Year 9 misconceptions such as substitution errors ($4x$ becoming $40$), inverse operation confusion (subtracting 2 instead of dividing), and mixing up the $x$ and $y$ intercepts, here is the predicted performance distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%
