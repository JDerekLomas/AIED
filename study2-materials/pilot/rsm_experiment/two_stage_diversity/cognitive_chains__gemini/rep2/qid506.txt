As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen this exact question trip up many Year 9s. It sits at a tricky intersection of one-step linear equations and fraction arithmetic.

Students at the **below_basic** level often struggle with "inverse operations" involving fractions. Many will see the 3 and the 12 and perform the most comfortable operation (12 ÷ 3) without regard for the fraction's structure, leading them to 4. Others will assume the 3 "cancels" into the 12, leading them to 1/4.

**Basic** students generally know they need to divide by 3, but the mechanics of dividing a fraction by an integer are risky. They frequently default to multiplying the numerator instead of the denominator (reaching 3/12 = 1/4) or mistakenly dividing the denominator by the integer.

**Proficient** students usually employ "Keep-Change-Flip" or conceptualize that dividing a fraction makes the denominator larger. They are prone to small arithmetic slips but generally land on B.

**Advanced** students will recognize the operation immediately and use substitution to verify their answer, resulting in very high accuracy.

Here is the predicted distribution for the mock results:

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=45% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=15% B=80% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=2% B=97% C=0% D=1%
