As a Year 9 maths teacher, I see this specific question as a "trap" regarding the role of zero in statistics and the understanding of mathematical notation (BIDMAS/BODMAS). 

The 5 perspectives provided show a common journey: students recognise the method for the mean, but struggle with how to represent it formally when a zero is involved. **Option B** is a classic "calculator entry error" where students forget brackets. **Option C** is the most common conceptual error (ignoring the zero as a data point). **Option A**, while mathematically correct in value, often feels "incomplete" to students because the zero is missing from the numerator, even though its omission doesn't change the sum.

Here is the predicted distribution of answers based on typical Year 9 mock exam data:

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=15% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%

**Teacher’s Notes on the Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level usually pick **B** because it "looks" like the steps of a calculation ($+$ then $\div$) without understanding operator precedence.
*   **Basic:** This group is split. Many will pick **C** because they conceptually believe that "zero doesn't count," while others will start to see the BIDMAS trap in B and gravitate toward A.
*   **Proficient:** These students, like the 5 perspectives provided, work through the BIDMAS issue and the "value of zero" issue. They realise that while A is missing the '0+', the division by 5 is the critical component for a list of five numbers.
*   **Advanced:** These students quickly identify that the numerator $1+3+4+7$ is equivalent to $0+1+3+4+7$ and that the fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol, making A the only mathematically sound expression. They may hesitate on D if they are pedantic about the missing zero, but will ultimately choose A.
