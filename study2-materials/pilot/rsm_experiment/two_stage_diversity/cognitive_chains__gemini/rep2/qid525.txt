Based on the five perspectives provided, which reflect common misconceptions (adding denominators) and process hurdles (improper vs. mixed numbers), here is the predicted breakdown of student responses for Year 9:

**below_basic: A=5% B=25% C=15% D=55%**
*At this level, many students still succumb to the "add across" misconception ($7+1$ and $10+4$), leading them directly to Option D. Others may guess Option C due to seeing $10 \times 4$ but failing to handle the whole numbers or numerators correctly.*

**basic: A=15% B=50% C=5% D=30%**
*Students at this level are often taught that adding denominators is a "cardinal sin," so they try to find a common denominator. However, they frequently make calculation errors or forget to convert their final answer to the required format (Option A) or revert to the "add across" method when they get stuck.*

**proficient: A=10% B=85% C=0% D=5%**
*Proficient students follow the steps outlined in the perspectives. They correctly calculate $4 \frac{19}{20}$, check it against the multiple-choice options, and importantly, heed the instruction to leave it as a mixed number rather than an improper fraction (Option A).*

**advanced: A=2% B=98% C=0% D=0%**
*Advanced students quickly identify $0.7 + 0.25 = 0.95$ or mentally find the common denominator of 20. They are highly unlikely to make the denominator addition error and will pay close attention to the formatting requirement ("mixed number").*
