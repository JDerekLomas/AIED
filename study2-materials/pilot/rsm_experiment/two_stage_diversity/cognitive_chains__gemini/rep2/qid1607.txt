Based on my experience marking Year 9 mock exams and observing the common misconceptions regarding inverse operations and two-step equations, here is the predicted percentage breakdown for each ability level:

**below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%**
Students at this level often struggle with the "change the side, change the sign" rule. Like Perspective 5, they may feel that because there is a $+1$, they should perform an addition on the other side. They are also prone to confusing "balancing" with "matching." Many will see two steps of work and assume that because the arithmetic ($15 \times 4 = 60$ and $60 + 1 = 61$) is correct in isolation, the algebraic process must be too.

**basic: A=45% B=5% C=45% D=5%**
These students generally understand Step 1 (multiplying by the denominator). However, Step 2 is the "tipping point." Like Perspective 2, about half will fail to apply the inverse operation correctly, defaulting to addition. The other half will successfully identify the need to subtract, as seen in Perspective 1 and 3, but may still be hesitant.

**proficient: A=80% B=2% C=15% D=3%**
Most students at this level can confidently solve a two-step equation. Like Perspective 4, they will perform a "mental check" (substituting 61 back into $1 + k = 60$) and realize it doesn't balance. They will correctly identify that Step 1 is valid while Step 2 is an inverse operation error. A small margin will still make a careless "sign error" and choose C.

**advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%**
Advanced students will immediately recognize this as a classic "distractor" question. They will see that Isaac has performed the first step correctly but failed to subtract 1 in the second step. They are very unlikely to choose B or D, and only a tiny percentage might misread the question or make a hasty judgment.
