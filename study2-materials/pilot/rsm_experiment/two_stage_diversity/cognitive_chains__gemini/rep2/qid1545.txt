As a Year 9 maths teacher, I see this specific question as a classic "order of operations" trap. While the students in the perspectives provided all eventually self-corrected to the right answer, the "Below Basic" and "Basic" cohorts often fall into the trap of reading left-to-right or getting confused by the "look" of the equation without a final check.

Here is my prediction of the percentage breakdown for each ability level:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=50% D=5%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=10% D=0%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
