As an experienced teacher marking these mock papers, I see a clear pattern in how Year 9 students navigate the "negative number minefield" within quadratic expansion. The majority of the perspectives provided show students who are self-correcting their misconceptions about signs, but in a real exam hall, many will slip up on the two main hurdles: the addition of two negatives $(-7 - 5)$ and the multiplication of two negatives $(-5 \times -7)$.

Here is the predicted breakdown of responses across ability levels:

**below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%**
Students at this level often struggle with the number line. They frequently pick **A** because they see -5 and -7 and simply find the difference (2), or **D** because they remember that the original problem had minus signs and assume the answer should only contain minus signs. Their "multiplication of two negatives" rule is very shaky.

**basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%**
These students (like those in Perspectives 2 and 4) usually remember FOIL but are prone to calculation slips. While many will successfully reach **B**, a significant number will fail the "negative x negative = positive" rule and land on **D**, or struggle with the direction of the number line and choose **A**.

**proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%**
Students at this level resemble Perspectives 1, 3, and 5. They have a solid grasp of directed numbers and algebraic expansion. They might make a "fingers and toes" counting error, but they are generally vigilant about checking their signs. Option **B** is the dominant choice here as they have automated the rule that "a negative times a negative is a positive."

**advanced: A=1% B=98% C=1% D=0%**
Advanced students will see the answer almost instantly. They recognise the pattern $x^2 + (a+b)x + ab$ and will not be tripped up by the negative signs. The very small percentage of errors would be attributed to extreme "exam-brain" haste rather than a lack of understanding.
