As a UK maths teacher marking Year 9 mock exams, I see this specific question as a test of two distinct skills: the arithmetic of adding fractions and the ability to follow a specific formatting instruction ("mixed number").

**Below Basic:** Many students here struggle with the "Keep, Change, Flip" or common denominator rules and frequently apply "add the tops, add the bottoms" (additive interference). Option D is a very common trap for them. Some may reach B or C but get confused by the format.
**Basic:** These students often know the rule for common denominators but are insecure. They might convert to improper fractions correctly (getting to B) but then fail to convert back to a mixed number as requested, or they might tentatively choose A but be tempted by D if they second-guess their denominator rules.
**Proficient:** These students typically handle mixed number addition confidently. The main risk here is a "calculation sneeze" or failing to read the instruction to leave it as a mixed number (leading them to B).
**Advanced:** Almost all these students will find the correct value. The only loss of marks here would be a rare lapse in reading the "mixed number" instruction, though at this level, they usually spot that A and B are equivalent and choose A based on the question's requirement.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=35% B=10% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=4% C=0% D=0%
