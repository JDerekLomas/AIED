As a teacher who has marked countless Year 9 mocks, the "BIDMAS trap" in Problem P is one of the most persistent misconceptions we face. Even students who correctly understand that Multiplication takes priority over Addition often apply the acronym literally when it comes to Addition and Subtraction, leading them to prioritize $5+6$ despite the subtraction sign being attached to the 5.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

**below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=25% D=20%**
Students at this level often default to a "reading order" (left-to-right) strategy for everything because they find the acronym confusing. Option A is the common choice for those who don't apply any order of operations. Option C represents a mix of reading order for one and the "A before S" literalism for the other.

**basic: A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%**
This is where the BIDMAS literalism is most dangerous. These students have learned the acronym but not the "equal priority" rule. They will almost certainly pick $5 \times 6$ for Problem Q, but their rigid adherence to the letters "A then S" makes D the most attractive, albeit incorrect, answer.

**proficient: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%**
Proficient students are starting to internalize that Addition and Subtraction are inverse operations of equal priority. However, under exam pressure, a significant minority will still revert to the literal order of the letters (Option D). The majority will correctly identify that they should work left-to-right for P and prioritise multiplication for Q.

**advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%**
Advanced students understand the "GEMS" or "Groupings, Exponents, Multiplicative, Additive" structure where $+$ and $-$ are treated as the same level. They will see $4 - 5 + 6$ as a string of terms. The only errors here usually come from overthinking or misreading the question.

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
