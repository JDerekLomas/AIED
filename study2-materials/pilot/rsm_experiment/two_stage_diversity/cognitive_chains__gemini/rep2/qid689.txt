As a UK maths teacher marking Year 9 mock exams, I see this specific question as a "trap" for students who rely on rote memorisation of procedures rather than an understanding of algebraic structure. The "unknown on the bottom" is a classic threshold concept.

Here is my prediction of the performance breakdown across ability levels:

**below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=35% D=5%**
Students at this level often associate algebra with "doing something to the two numbers visible." They frequently multiply ($10 \times 5 = 50$) or perform the division in the easiest direction ($10 \div 5 = 2$). Because they lack a "substitution check" habit, they often select B or C without noticing the results don't make sense.

**basic: A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%**
These students have a better grasp of inverse operations but often get the "direction" of the division wrong (choosing $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$). However, as seen in the perspectives, Year 9 students at this level often use the multiple-choice options to their advantage. They are likely to "test" the numbers and might stumble upon A by checking if $5 \div 0.5$ works.

**proficient: A=85% B=5% C=10% D=0%**
Proficient students generally know to multiply by the denominator first ($10p = 5$). The main source of error here is a "slip" where they unintentionally write $p = 10/5$ instead of $5/10$. Most will self-correct after a quick mental check.

**advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%**
Advanced students will either instantly recognise the relationship or perform the algebraic manipulation (cross-multiplying or swapping the $p$ and the 10) fluently. Mistakes at this level are almost exclusively down to misreading the numbers rather than a lack of understanding.

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=35% D=5%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=10% D=0%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
