Based on the five perspectives provided, we can identify several common misconceptions typical for Year 9 students:
1. **The "40" error:** Concatenating 4 and 0 rather than multiplying.
2. **Multiplication by zero:** Thinking $4 \times 0 = 4$.
3. **The "Take away" error:** Solving $2y = 10$ by subtracting 2 ($10 - 2 = 8$) instead of dividing.
4. **Incorrect Variable substitution:** Solving for $x$ when $y=0$ (yielding 2.5) or solving for $x=1$ (yielding 3).

Here is the predicted distribution of answers based on these common Year 9 attainment levels:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=40% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=65% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=8% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=97% D=1%
