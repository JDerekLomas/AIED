As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen that this specific Year 9 topic—converting horizontal division to algebraic fractions—tends to catch students out on the "direction" of the division (the numerator/denominator relationship) and the function of brackets (the fraction bar as a grouping symbol).

Here is the predicted distribution based on typical mock exam performance data:

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=65% B=5% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=8% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%

### Examiner's Rationale:

*   **below_basic:** Students at this level often struggle with the order of operations and "algebraic grammar." A significant portion will choose **C** because they see $c \div h$ and treat the $+4$ as a separate entity, essentially ignoring the brackets. **D** is also a common "flip" error where the lengthier expression is perceived as the "primary" part of the sum and placed on top.
*   **basic:** Like the students in the perspectives provided, "Basic" students are generally coached that the first number goes on top. They are likely to correctly identify **A** through the process of elimination, though they might hesitate on whether the brackets need to be "distributed" (Option B) or if the brackets simply disappear.
*   **proficient:** These students recognise the fraction bar as a vinculum (a grouping symbol that replaces the need for brackets). They quickly discard **B** and **D** as illogical. The only slight distractor is **C**, for those who might overthink the order of operations.
*   **advanced:** At this level, the convention is automatic. They would recognise **A** immediately as the only mathematically equivalent form and would not be distracted by the common pitfalls.
