As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen this exact question trip up students across all levels. The core issues here are the distinction between an even power and a multiplier, and the "calculator trap" where $-3^4$ and $(-3)^4$ yield different results.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock exam trends:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=35% B=10% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=0% C=35% D=0%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%

**Teacher’s Notes on the Perspectives:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with indices vs. multiplication. You see this in Perspective 3 and 5's initial thoughts where they consider $3 \times 4$. D is a very attractive "guess" because it incorporates both the multiplication error and the negative sign from the question.
*   **Basic/Proficient:** This is where the "C vs A" battle happens (Perspectives 1 and 4). Students at this level know $3^4 = 81$, but they have a lingering rule in their heads that "if the input is negative, the output is negative." Many will also have been burned by typing `-3^4` into a Casio calculator without brackets, leading them to believe -81 is the mathematically "official" answer.
*   **Advanced:** Students at this level recognise that $k^4$ means $(-3)^4$. They are confident in the rule that an even power of any real number (other than zero) is positive. The 5% choosing C usually accounts for simple "copying" errors or overthinking the calculator logic.
