As a teacher marking these Year 9 mocks, this question is a classic test of whether a student can manage two different rules at once: the property of the multiplicative inverse (reciprocal) and the rules for multiplying directed numbers.

Looking at the perspectives provided, they represent a fairly standard cognitive journey for Year 9. Even when students understand the concept of a reciprocal, the presence of the negative sign on the right-hand side often "tricks" them into looking for a second negative sign to match, leading them to Option B.

Here is my prediction for the percentage distribution based on ability levels:

**below_basic: A=30% B=45% C=15% D=10%**
Students at this level often associate "reciprocal" questions with "changing everything." They might recognize that the numbers need to flip, but they often apply a "matching" logic to the signs, assuming that since there is a minus in the question and a minus in the answer, the middle term must also be negative. Many also confuse addition rules (keep the sign) with multiplication rules.

**basic: A=50% B=35% C=10% D=5%**
These students generally understand that $3/4 \times 4/3 = 1$. The struggle here is the "sign-flip" intuition. They often hesitate between A and B. However, as seen in the perspectives, basic-level students who talk themselves through it (e.g., "minus times plus is minus") are more likely to land on A, while those who rush will instinctively choose B because it "looks" more like the original term.

**proficient: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%**
At this level, the "inverse property of multiplication" is more stable. These students quickly identify $4/3$ as the reciprocal. Most will verify the signs correctly ($-\times+=-$), as seen in Perspectives 4 and 5. The errors here are usually due to overthinking or misremembering $ -1 \div -3/4$ and making a manual calculation error.

**advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%**
Advanced students see this as an identity: $x \cdot (1/x) = 1$. They recognize that because the minus sign is preserved from the first term to the answer, the star must be the identity-neutral positive reciprocal. Errors at this level are almost exclusively down to "silly" mistakes or bubbling in the wrong letter.
