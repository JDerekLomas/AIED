As an experienced teacher, I have marked thousands of these papers. This specific question highlights a classic misconception regarding the "order of operations in reverse" and the distributive property of multiplication over equality.

**Analysis of Student Performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students often treat equations as "moving parts" without understanding the underlying balance. Many will see Katie’s move as valid because $12 \times 3 = 36$ is "true math" in isolation. They often ignore the "do it to everything" rule, leading to high percentages choosing **C**.
*   **Basic/Proficient:** These students usually remember the mnemonic SAMDREB (Substitutions/Subtraction first) and recognize Tom’s move as "the way we do it." However, they are still prone to believing there is only one correct path. Many will correctly identify that Katie failed to multiply the $-5$ and therefore conclude only Tom is correct (**A**).
*   **Proficient/Advanced:** Higher-ability students are more likely to check the validity of a step by "testing" the value of $x$. Since Tom’s path leads to $x=51$ (which works) and Katie’s leads to $x=41$ (which fails), they confidently select **A**. Only the most elite students might hesitate and think about whether Katie’s line *could* have been correct if she had multiplied correctly, but the question asks about her *specific* line ($x-5=36$), which is objectively false.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock data:

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=10% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
