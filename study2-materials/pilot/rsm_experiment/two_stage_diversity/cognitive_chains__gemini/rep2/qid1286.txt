As a Year 9 mock examiner, I have evaluated these perspectives. They represent a classic "changing the subject" task involving a multi-step rearrangement with a fraction, a product, and a power.

In Year 9, "Below Basic" students often struggle with the initial formula or mistake the inverse of multiplication for subtraction. "Basic" students usually identify the correct formula but often invert the fraction during rearrangement. "Proficient" students typically handle the algebra well but may hesitate on whether the $\pi$ is in the numerator or denominator. "Advanced" students generally navigate the multi-step inverse operations fluently.

Here is the predicted distribution based on common misconceptions (such as $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ vs the inverse $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$) and algebraic slips:

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
