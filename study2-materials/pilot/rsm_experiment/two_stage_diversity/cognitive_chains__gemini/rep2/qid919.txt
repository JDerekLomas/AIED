Based on the thought processes shown in the perspectives, which highlight common Year 9 misconceptions regarding the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and decimal multiplication, here is the predicted distribution of answers:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=30% B=30% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=20% B=65% C=0% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=92% C=0% D=3%

**Examiner Commentary:**
*   **Option A (0.81):** A classic "left-to-right" error. Students at the below-basic and basic levels often multiply $3$ by $0.3$ first, getting $0.9$, and then square the result. This indicates a failure to apply BIDMAS correctly.
*   **Option B (0.27):** The correct answer. Students reaching this must correctly square the decimal (identifying two decimal places) and apply the correct order of operations.
*   **Option C (1.8):** A rare distractor usually chosen by students who mistake $x^2$ for $2x$ ($3 \times 0.3 \times 2$), seen primarily at the lowest ability level.
*   **Option D (2.7):** A very high-frequency error. Many students (even those who know BIDMAS) struggle with the placement of the decimal point, incorrectly calculating $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. Perspective 4 perfectly illustrates this common pitfall.
