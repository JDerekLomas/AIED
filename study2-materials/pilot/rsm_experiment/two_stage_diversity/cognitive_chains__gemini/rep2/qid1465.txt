As a Year 9 maths teacher, I see these exact thought patterns every time we run mocks. 

The main "traps" in this question are the **Left-to-Right Error** (leading to 4) and the **BIDMAS Addition-Priority Error** (leading to -10). Students often think Addition *must* come before Subtraction, rather than treating them with equal priority. Below Basic students frequently ignore order of operations entirely, while Basic students often over-apply the acronym "Addition before Subtraction" incorrectly.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=45% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
