Based on the five perspectives provided and my experience as a UK maths teacher marking Year 9 mock exams, here is the predicted breakdown of student responses. 

The majority of students (represented by the perspectives) are capable of finding a common denominator but frequently struggle with the specific terminology of the question (mixed number vs. improper fraction) or the common pitfall of adding denominators directly (Option D).

**Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the concept of common denominators and are highly susceptible to "additive thinking"—simply adding the numerators and denominators. They may also pick C if they multiply denominators but fail to adjust numerators.
**Basic:** These students usually remember to find a common denominator (likely 20 or 40) but may fail to read the instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number, leading them to Option A. They are also prone to calculation errors.
**Proficient:** These students, much like the ones in the perspectives, correctly calculate $4 \frac{19}{20}$. They occasionally hesitate between A and B but usually identify the "mixed number" requirement correctly.
**Advanced:** These students will identify the correct common denominator quickly, perform the mental arithmetic accurately, and strictly follow the formatting instruction (mixed number) without being distracted by the equivalent improper fraction.

below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=20% D=45%
basic: A=30% B=45% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
