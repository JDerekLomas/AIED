As a Year 9 maths teacher, I have marked thousands of papers exactly like this. This question is a classic "trap" that tests the intersection of algebraic manipulation and fraction arithmetic.

Students at the **below_basic** level often struggle with the reciprocal nature of the operation. They see '3' and '12' and immediately want to perform the operation $12 \div 3 = 4$, often ignoring the fraction structure entirely or placing the 4 as a whole number.

Those at the **basic** level recognise the need to divide, but they suffer from the "12 divided by 3" intuition. They correctly identify that they should divide the right-hand side, but mistakenly calculate $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$ as $\frac{1}{4}$ because they are dividing the denominator rather than multiplying it.

**Proficient** students have the "Keep, Change, Flip" (KFC) or "Keep, Flip, Change" rule in their toolkit. However, as seen in the perspectives, they often have to wrestle with the initial instinct that the answer might be $1/4$ before correcting themselves.

**Advanced** students see $3p = 1/12$ and immediately conceptualise it as $p = 1/(12 \times 3)$ or recognise that if $3p = \text{something}$, $p$ must be a third of that something, leading them straight to $1/36$.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on these common Year 9 misconceptions:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
