As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen this specific question trip up students across all sets. The "trap" here is the relationship between the **reciprocal** and the **sign**. While stronger students recognise that $a \times b = -1$ implies $b$ is the negative reciprocal of $1/a$ (or in this case, just the reciprocal since the minus is already present), lower-ability students often over-apply the "minus times a minus makes a plus" rule without checking the target result is actually negative.

The five perspectives provided show a remarkably high level of self-correction (all five eventually reaching A), which is more typical of a **Proficient** student who "checks their work." Below that level, students often jump to B because they see a minus in the question and a minus in the answer and assume the missing term must also be negative to "match."

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=40% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=20% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%

**Teacher's Commentary:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will choose **B** because they associate "fractions and -1" with a need for more negatives, or they'll pick **D** because they think you have to multiply by the same number to get a '1-like' result.
*   **Basic:** Students often identify the reciprocal ($4/3$) but succumb to the "negative reflex"—they think all the numbers in the equation should be negative to make the answer negative.
*   **Proficient:** Like the perspectives provided, these students will test the signs. Some will still fall for **B** if they work too quickly and don't re-read the "$-1$" result carefully.
*   **Advanced:** Most will see the identity $(x) \cdot (1/x) = 1$ and instantly conclude that to keep the negative sign, the multiplier must be positive. Any errors here are usually purely clerical.
