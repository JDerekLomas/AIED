As an experienced maths teacher, marking these scripts reveals that this question primarily tests two distinct skills: understanding the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the mechanics of multiplying decimals.

Year 9 students often struggle with $(0.3)^2$, frequently giving $0.9$ as an answer. Those who make this "one decimal place" error but follow BIDMAS will arrive at $2.7$ (Option D). Those who fail BIDMAS by multiplying $3 \times 0.3$ first will arrive at $0.81$ (Option A). Option C is typically a "guess" or a doubling error ($3 \times 0.6$).

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on common misconceptions:

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=35% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=15% B=65% C=0% D=20%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=0% D=5%
