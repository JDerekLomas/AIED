As a Year 9 maths teacher, I see these patterns frequently in mock exams. Adding mixed numbers with common denominators tests two specific pitfalls: the temptation to add denominators and the ability to distinguish between improper fractions and mixed numbers.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on the typical misconceptions seen in the classroom:

below_basic: A=35% B=10% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%

**Teacher's Notes:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the "adding the denominator" rule (Option D). Some will also attempt to convert to improper fractions but fail the calculation or incorrectly add the bottoms (Option C).
*   **Basic:** They generally remember that the denominator stays the same, but about 20% will still lapse under exam pressure and add the 5s (Option D).
*   **Proficient:** These students rarely make the denominator mistake but often calculate the improper fraction ($\frac{18}{5}$) first. A small percentage (10%) will forget to convert back to a mixed number as requested, leading them to Option B.
*   **Advanced:** These students will almost universally recognise the integer addition ($2+1$) and fraction addition ($\frac{1}{5}+\frac{2}{5}$) as the most efficient path, correctly identifying the mixed number format required for Option A.
