As a teacher marking these mock exams, it's clear that the addition of algebraic fractions is a real separator in Year 9. Many students understand the concept of a common denominator but often trip up on the execution or revert to the "common sense" error of adding across the top and bottom.

Based on the student perspectives provided and typical UK Year 9 performance data, here is the predicted breakdown:

**below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%**
*At this level, "adding across" (Option B) is the most intuitive trap. Students see 3+4 and 2x+x and reach for 7/3x immediately without considering denominators. Option D is a common guess for those who realize they need a 2x but forget to change the numerator.*

**basic: A=50% B=25% C=10% D=15%**
*Like Perspectives 1 and 2, these students have the "Common Denominator" rule in their heads but are shaky. Half will successfully reach 11/2x, while the rest will either add across or make an error in the expansion (e.g., doubling the 3 instead of the 4).*

**proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%**
*These students are like Perspectives 3 and 4; they are systematically finding the common denominator. Most will get to 11/2x. The few errors here are usually "careless" slips (like the 3+8=10 shown in Perspective 5) or accidentally doubling the denominator twice.*

**advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%**
*At this level, the process is fluent. Any errors would be highly atypical and likely due to extreme exam pressure or misreading the original values.*
