As a Year 9 maths teacher, I see this specific mistake (the 'change the side, but don't change the sign' error) constantly. Students often have a good grasp of the first step (multiplying to remove a denominator), but their grasp of inverse operations becomes shaky when they 'move' terms across the equals sign.

Based on the student perspectives provided and common misconceptions seen in the classroom:

- **Below Basic** students often assume that if a number is positive, they should add it when it moves. They rarely check their answers by substitution (Perspective 1), leading them to choose **C**.
- **Basic** students often recognize the steps of the process but struggle with the consistency of inverse operations. They frequently second-guess whether to add or subtract (Perspective 2 & 5) but often catch the error if they bother to check the final answer against the original equation.
- **Proficient** students usually identify Step 1 correctly and have a stronger awareness that $60 = 1 + k$ implies $k$ must be smaller than 60. They catch the sign error in Step 2 (Perspective 3 & 4).
- **Advanced** students solve the equation mentally almost immediately ($k=59$) and can pinpoint exactly where Isaac deviated from the correct algebraic path.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=55% D=5%
basic: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=10% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
