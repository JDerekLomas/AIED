As a Year 9 Maths teacher, I’ve seen these specific thought patterns many times. This question specifically tests Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the understanding of inequality symbols.

Students at the **Below Basic** level often work left-to-right regardless of operators, leading them to calculate $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$ on both sides, making the equals sign a very common "trap" answer. At the **Basic** level, students remember the BIDMAS acronym but often hesitate on which comes first or struggle with the direction of the inequality symbol. By **Proficient** and **Advanced**, the priority of division over addition is internalised.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on common classroom misconceptions:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=50% D=5%
basic: A=65% B=15% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=5% D=0%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
