Based on the five perspectives provided, we can identify several common misconceptions and systematic errors for Year 9 students. These include treating substitution as "concatenation" ($4x$ becomes $40$), confusion between $n \times 0$ being $n$ or $0$, and inverse operation errors (subtracting the coefficient instead of dividing).

**Perspective Breakdown:**
- **A (20):** Calculated by doing $10 \div 2$ then multiplying by the $x$-coefficient, or a total guess by multiplying $4 \times 5$. 
- **B (3):** This is the value of $y$ when $x=1$ (given in the second column of a standard table). Students may move one step along the table or misread the column.
- **C (5):** The correct answer. Even students who initially make errors (like $40$ or subtracting $2$) often self-correct to 5 because it is a "familiar" number and fits the equation.
- **D (2.5):** A common "interchange" error where the student divides 10 by the wrong coefficient (4 instead of 2), or correctly finds the x-intercept when $y=0$.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses based on Year 9 ability levels:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=55% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%
