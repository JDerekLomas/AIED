As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen these exact thought processes play out every year. The "Addition before Subtraction" trap is one of the most persistent misconceptions in Year 9. While students usually grasp that multiplication precedes addition, the hierarchical nature of the BIDMAS/BODMAS acronym leads many to believe that addition must be performed before subtraction, rather than treating them with equal priority from left to right.

Here is my prediction of the percentage breakdown based on common classroom data and the perspectives provided:

below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=0% D=25%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

**Teacher’s Notes on the Data:**

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level often default to a strictly linear "left-to-right" approach for everything, ignoring order of operations entirely (leading to Option A). Some have a vague memory of BIDMAS but apply it sporadically (leading to Option C).
*   **Basic:** This is the most "dangerous" level for this specific question. Students know the acronym exists but take it literally. Perspective 2 and 5 represent this group well—they correctly identify multiplication's priority but fall into the "A before S" trap, making Option D a very popular distractor.
*   **Proficient:** These students generally understand that addition and subtraction have equal priority. Perspective 1, 3, and 4 highlight the internal struggle they face: they know the "left-to-right" rule for P, but the acronym's spelling makes them second-guess themselves. Most will settle on the correct Option B.
*   **Advanced:** These students have internalized the "Left-to-Right" rule for Addition/Subtraction and Multiplication/Division. They view the operations as commutative equivalents (or see subtraction as adding a negative). They will almost exclusively choose Option B, with only a tiny margin for "overthinking" errors.
