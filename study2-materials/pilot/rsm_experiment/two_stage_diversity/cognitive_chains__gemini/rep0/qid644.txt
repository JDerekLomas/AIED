Based on my experience marking Year 9 papers, the expansion of brackets—specifically the "Last" terms in FOIL—is a classic pitfall for students regarding directed numbers. While the calculation $1 \times 4$ is simple, the confusion between "multiplying negatives" and "adding negatives" often causes students to land on D or B.

Here is the predicted distribution of answers based on common misconceptions:

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
