As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen hundreds of Year 9 students tackle this specific quadratic expansion. The main "trip-wires" in this question are the addition of directed numbers (specifically $-7 - 5$) and the multiplication of two negatives ($-5 \times -7$).

Here is a breakdown of how students across the ability spectrum typically perform on this task:

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the "FOIL" process or its equivalent. They frequently make errors with the constant term (treating $-5 \times -7$ as $-35$ or even $-12$) and often arrive at Option A by incorrectly combining the middle terms as if one were positive ($7 - 5 = 2$).
*   **Basic:** Students at this level generally remember the method for expansion but are highly prone to sign errors. Many will correctly calculate $-12m$ but fall into the trap of Option D because they instinctively feel that "a problem full of minuses should end in a minus."
*   **Proficient:** These students have internalized the rule that "a negative times a negative is a positive." They are the cohort represented in your five perspectives: they double-check their number line jumps and usually self-correct. However, under exam pressure, a small percentage will still choose C due to a momentary lapse in sign logic.
*   **Advanced:** These students see the pattern $(x-a)(x-b) = x^2 - (a+b)x + ab$. They rarely make the $+35$ error and almost never the $-2m$ error. Their few mistakes are usually clerical.
