Based on the five perspectives provided, all students correctly identified that Tom’s method of "moving the minus 5" to add it to the other side is valid. However, the perspectives also highlight a common misconception regarding the distributive property when multiplying an entire equation by a denominator. 

Many students at lower and middle ability levels struggle with the "order of operations" in reverse (SAMDOB) or the requirement to multiply every term in an equation by the denominator. While the students in these perspectives ultimately reasoned their way to the correct answer by testing the values, in a high-pressure mock exam, many students would fall into the trap of thinking Katie’s method "looks" mathematically plausible because she performed an operation on both sides ($12 \times 3$ and $\frac{x}{3} \times 3$).

Here is the predicted percentage distribution:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
