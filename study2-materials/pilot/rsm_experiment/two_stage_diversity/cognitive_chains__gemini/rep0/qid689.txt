As a Year 9 maths teacher, I see this specific problem frequently. It tests the common misconception surrounding "rearranging when the unknown is in the denominator." Students often default to "multiplying the numbers" or performing division in the wrong order ($10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$).

Here is my prediction based on the student perspectives provided and typical mock exam performance data for this age group:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=45% D=5%
Many students at this level struggle with the inverse operation of a denominator. They are highly likely to either multiply the visible numbers ($10 \times 5 = 50$) or divide the larger by the smaller ($10 \div 5 = 2$) without checking if their answer makes logical sense when substituted back into the equation.

basic: A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%
Students at this level often correctly identify that they should multiply by $p$ to get $10p = 5$. However, "big number divided by small number" is a deep-seated reflex. Like Perspectives 3 and 4 initially showed, many will write $p=2$ and forget to check their work, leading them to choose C over A.

proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
These students are more likely to go through the process seen in Perspectives 1, 2, and 5. They might initially trip up and think $p=2$, but they have developed the habit of mental substitution ("5 divided by 2 is 2.5, that's not 10") which allows them to self-correct to 0.5.

advanced: A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%
Advanced students generally recognise the reciprocal nature of the equation immediately (swapping $p$ and $10$) or see that for a numerator of 5 to result in a larger quotient of 10, the denominator must be a proper fraction. Errors here are usually due to extreme haste rather than lack of understanding.
