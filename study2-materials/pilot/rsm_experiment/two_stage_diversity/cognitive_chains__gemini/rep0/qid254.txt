As a Year 9 maths teacher, I see this type of question often. It isn't just testing the formula for the mean; it's a "trap" question designed to test the understanding of **the role of zero** in data sets and the application of **order of operations (BIDMAS)**.

Here is my prediction of the results:

**below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=5%**
Students at this level often treat "mean" as a string of numbers to enter into a calculator. They are most likely to pick **B** because it matches the visual order of the numbers in the question, ignoring the BIDMAS implications. **C** is also a popular choice because they frequently believe that zero "doesn't count" as a number of observations.

**basic: A=40% B=25% C=30% D=5%**
These students know the "sum divided by count" rule but struggle with the zero. Many will see **A** as a potential shortcut since adding zero doesn't change the total, but a significant portion will still gravitate toward **C**, logically concluding that because zero has no value, the set only has four "real" numbers.

**proficient: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%**
Proficient students generally understand that the zero must be included in the denominator (count) but not necessarily in the numerator's expression since $n + 0 = n$. They are savvy enough to spot that **B** is incorrect due to BIDMAS (division before addition), which makes **A** the only mathematically sound choice remaining.

**advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%**
Advanced students will immediately identify the "zero trap." They recognize that while $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$ is the "formal" way to write it, it is mathematically identical to option **A**. They will quickly dismiss **B** for its lack of brackets and **C** for the incorrect denominator. Some might choose **D** if they are being pedantic about the absence of the zero in the expression, but most will select the mathematically equivalent **A**.
