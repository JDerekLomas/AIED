In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), solving one-step equations involving fractions is a common area for "mal-rules" to emerge.

### 1. The Misconception: "Operation Pairing" (Multiplication as Division)
The specific misconception is **Scalar Interaction with the Numerator**, often caused by a "buggy" application of the rule: *"To move a number from one side to the other, you perform the opposite operation."*

While the student correctly identifies that they need to divide by 3, they possess a procedural bug where they believe that **dividing a fraction by a whole number is equivalent to dividing the numerator by that number.** They view the fraction as two separate integers rather than a single value.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:

1.  **Identify the goal:** "I need to get $p$ on its own, so I must move the 3."
2.  **Determine the inverse:** "The 3 is multiplying $p$, so I must divide the other side by 3."
3.  **Perform the buggy division:** The student looks at $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$. Instead of multiplying the denominator (the correct procedure), they attempt to divide the "top number" (the 1) by 3.
4.  **Mental adjustment:** Realising that $1 \div 3$ doesn't result in a whole number, they may instead look at the whole expression $\frac{1}{12}$ and mistakenly treat it as a relationship where they can simply divide the denominator by 3 because it "goes into it perfectly."
5.  **Execution:** They calculate $12 \div 3 = 4$.
6.  **Final result:** They place this result back into the fraction structure, leading to $p = \frac{1}{4}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: $p = \frac{1}{4}$.**

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is a highly "attractive" error for several reasons:

*   **Fluency with 3 and 12:** Year 9 students have 3 and 12 linked via their 3-times table. When a student sees $3$, $1$, and $12$ in a problem, the number $4$ feels "correct" because it is a factor.
*   **Cognitive Ease:** Dividing 12 by 3 to get 4 is much more intuitive than multiplying 12 by 3 to get 36. To a student struggling with the concept of "parts," it feels illogical that dividing $3p$ (making it smaller) would result in a number with a larger denominator ($1/36$).
*   **The "Sensibility" Trap:** A student might check their work by thinking, *"Is 1/4 bigger or smaller than 1/12? It's bigger. Does that make sense?"* Often, students incorrectly assume that dividing a fraction should result in a "cleaner" or "smaller-looking" denominator.

The student would likely **not realize they went wrong.** In their mind, they followed the rule "divide by 3" and used a known number bond ($12 \div 3 = 4$), providing a false sense of security in the result.
