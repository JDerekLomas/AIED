Here is the analysis of the mathematical misconception for the given question.

### 1. The specific misconception: Squaring the Coefficient (Linear-Square Expansion)
The most common procedural error for this specific question is **squaring both the base ($x$) and the coefficient (3)** instead of following the correct Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). This is a "linear-square expansion" bug, where the student erroneously treats $3x^2$ as being equivalent to $(3x)^2$.

### 2. Step-by-step student reasoning
A student with this misconception would process the equation as follows:

*   **Step 1:** Substitute the value of $x = 0.3$ into the expression: $3 \times 0.3^2$.
*   **Step 2:** Misapply the order of operations by performing the multiplication first. They calculate $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$.
*   **Step 3:** Square the result of that multiplication: $0.9^2 = 0.81$.
*   **Alternative reasoning:** Some students may think that "three times $x$ squared" implies that the whole term $3x$ is the object being squared, resulting in $3^2 \times 0.3^2 = 9 \times 0.09 = 0.81$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: 0.81**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is an **extremely attractive error** for Year 9 students for several reasons:

*   **Linguistic Ambiguity:** When reading "$3x$ squared" aloud, the phrasing does not clarify whether the square applies to the $x$ or the entire $3x$ term. Students often prioritize the left-to-right reading of the symbols ($3$ then $x$ then square).
*   **Simplicity of Calculation:** $0.9^2$ is a very "satisfying" calculation. Students often feel a sense of success when they arrive at a clean decimal like $0.81$, as it resembles the squares they are familiar with ($9^2 = 81$).
*   **Misapplication of Algebra:** Students who have recently learned to expand brackets like $(3x)^2 = 9x^2$ often become confused when brackets are absent, mistakenly assuming the index applies to everything in the term.
*   **Lack of Internal Red Flags:** Unlike Option C ($1.8$, where the student might have multiplied $3 \times 2 \times 0.3$) or Option D ($2.7$, where they may have moved a decimal incorrectly), Option A feels like it involves the "correct" operations, just in the wrong order. The student is unlikely to realize they are wrong because $0.81$ appears as a "clean" distractor.
