In the context of UK Year 9 Algebra (Algebraic Fractions), here is a breakdown of a common misconception for this question.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Add Everything" (Freshman's Error for Fractions)
The specific misconception is the **component-wise addition of numerators and denominators.** In this "buggy procedure," the student treats the horizontal fraction bar as a separator rather than an operator. Instead of finding a common denominator, they apply the rule for multiplying fractions (top $\times$ top, bottom $\times$ bottom) to addition, simply adding across the top and adding across the bottom.

### 2. The Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would work through the problem as follows:

*   **Step 1:** Look at the numerators (3 and 4) and add them together: $3 + 4 = 7$.
*   **Step 2:** Look at the denominators ($2x$ and $x$) and add them together: $2x + x = 3x$.
*   **Step 3:** Place the sum of the numerators over the sum of the denominators to create the final fraction.
*   **Result:** $\frac{7}{3x}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option B: $\frac{7}{3x}$.**

### 4. How Natural/Attractive is the Error?
This is an **extremely high-frequency error** for Year 9 students. It is highly attractive for several reasons:

*   **Consistency Bias:** Students have spent years learning that in almost every other area of maths, "addition means total." It feels intuitively "fair" to add the bottom numbers if you are adding the top numbers.
*   **Path of Least Resistance:** Finding a common denominator requires the student to recognize that $\frac{4}{x}$ is equivalent to $\frac{8}{2x}$. The "Add Everything" method allows the student to bypass the cognitively demanding step of finding a lowest common multiple (LCM).
*   **Lack of Internal Conflict:** Because $3x$ *looks* like a logical combination of $2x$ and $x$, the student will not experience any "mathematical alarm bells." They will arrive at a neat, simplified-looking fraction and likely feel confident in their answer, unaware that they have violated the fundamental logic of fractional parts (where the denominator represents the *size* of the pieces, not the quantity).
