In the context of UK Year 9 Algebra (Algebraic Fractions), the following is a very common misconception.

### 1. The specific misconception or procedural error
**The "Add Across" Error (specifically, adding the denominators).**

This is a **structural carryover error** where a student treats algebraic fractions as "piles" of numbers to be combined horizontally. The student ignores the fundamental requirement for a common denominator before adding, or they incorrectly apply the rules for fraction *multiplication* (where you multiply across) to *addition*. In this specific case, the student performs the operation: $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d}$.

### 2. How a student with this misconception would work through the question
*   **Step 1:** The student looks at the numerators ($3$ and $4$) and adds them together: $3 + 4 = 7$.
*   **Step 2:** The student looks at the denominators ($2x$ and $x$) and adds them together. 
*   **Step 3:** To add $2x + x$, they combine like terms to get $3x$.
*   **Step 4:** They place the new numerator over the new denominator to get the final fraction: $\frac{7}{3x}$.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads directly to **Option B: $\frac{7}{3x}$.**

### 4. How natural/attractive this error is
This error is **highly attractive** and often feels "correct" to a Year 9 student for several reasons:

*   **Consistency with Multiplication:** Students are taught that for $\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d}$, they should multiply straight across. Intuitively, they feel that "addition should work the same way as multiplication," creating a false symmetry in their mental model.
*   **Path of Least Resistance:** Finding a common denominator ($2x$) requires a multi-step "preparation" phase before the actual addition can happen. Adding across is a single-step process that feels efficient and requires less cognitive load.
*   **The "Whole Number" Bias:** From early primary school, students are conditioned that addition increases the total. To them, if you have a $3$, a $4$, a $2x$, and an $x$, the final answer "should" contain a $7$ and a $3x$.

**Would the student realize they went wrong?**
**No.** To a student with this "bug," the result $\frac{7}{3x}$ looks perfectly "simple" (as the question requested). Because their process followed a consistent (albeit incorrect) logic, they would likely select Option B with high confidence, assuming that Option A ($\frac{11}{2x}$) resulted from a calculation they simply didn't understand. They would not experience any "cognitive dissonance" until the correct method of finding a common denominator is reinforced.
