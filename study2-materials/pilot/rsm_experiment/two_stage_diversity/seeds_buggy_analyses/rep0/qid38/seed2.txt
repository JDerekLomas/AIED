In the context of Year 9 algebra, a common hurdle is moving from numerical fractions to those involving variables.

### 1. The Misconception: "Naive Linear Addition" (The Add-Across Error)
The most common procedural error is the **"Add-Across"** bug. This occurs when a student treats algebraic fractions as strings of independent numbers, failing to recognize that denominators represent a shared unit (size) and numerators represent the quantity. The student applies the same logic they might mistakenly use for simple addition: **Add the tops, add the bottoms.**

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:

*   **Step 1:** Look at the numerators (the "tops"). They see $3$ and $4$. They add them together: $3 + 4 = 7$.
*   **Step 2:** Look at the denominators (the "bottoms"). They see $2x$ and $x$. They treat these as terms in a linear expression. They add them together: $2x + x = 3x$.
*   **Step 3:** Combine these results into a new fraction: $\frac{7}{3x}$.

They bypass the need for a Common Denominator entirely, treating the $"+"$ sign as a command to merge both parts of the fractions simultaneously.

### 3. Resulting Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option B: $\frac{7}{3x}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is an **extremely attractive** error for several reasons:

*   **Logical Consistency:** To a student struggling with the abstract nature of $x$, "3 of these plus 4 of those equals 7, and 2 $x$s plus 1 $x$ equals 3 $x$s" feels like perfectly consistent logic. 
*   **Cognitive Ease:** It avoids the "hard" steps of finding a Least Common Multiple (LCM) or scaling the second fraction by $2/2$. 
*   **Self-Correction Likelihood:** The student would **not realize they are wrong.** Because the result looks like a "simpler" version of the original expression, it satisfies the prompt’s requirement to write it "as simply as possible." They would see "7" and "3x" appearing in the answer bank and feel an immediate sense of validation that their procedure was correct. 

*Note: The correct answer (A) requires the student to realize that $\frac{4}{x}$ must become $\frac{8}{2x}$ before adding, resulting in $\frac{11}{2x}$.*
