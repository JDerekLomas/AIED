In the context of UK Year 9 Algebra (Algebraic Fractions), here is a breakdown of a highly common misconception for this specific question.

### 1. The Misconception: "The Universal Add-Across Bug" (Freshman's Dream for Fractions)
The student treats the addition of fractions similarly to the multiplication of fractions. Instead of finding a common denominator, they believe they can simply apply the operation to the numerators and the denominators independently. 

In this specific case, the student assumes that:
\[ \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d} \]

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would process the question in these steps:

1.  **Identify Numerators:** Look at the top numbers (3 and 4) and add them together: \(3 + 4 = 7\).
2.  **Identify Denominators:** Look at the bottom expressions (\(2x\) and \(x\)) and add them together.
3.  **Perform Algebra Addition:** The student calculates \(2x + x\). Because they see a "2" and an "invisible 1" (or sometimes they treat it as $2x + x = 3x$), they arrive at \(3x\).
4.  **Combine:** Place the sum of the numerators over the sum of the denominators.
5.  **Final Result:** Arrive at \(\frac{7}{3x}\).

### 3. Corresponding Answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option B**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly natural** and seductive for several reasons:

*   **Consistency with Multiplication:** Students have recently learned that for \(\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d}\), you *do* just multiply across. They crave a universal rule for all four operations and struggle with why addition requires the "extra" step of finding a common denominator.
*   **Intuition:** It feels "fair" and logical to perform the same operation to both parts of the fraction. 
*   **Absence of Error Signals:** The student will likely **not realize they have gone wrong.** Unlike questions that might lead to a messy, non-simplifiable answer, Option B looks "clean" and utilizes all the numbers present in the question. The student feels they have successfully "combined" everything provided into a single term, providing a false sense of completion and mathematical elegance. 

*Note: While Option D is a common error resulting from forgetting to multiply the 4 by 2, Option B is the "classic" misconception reflecting a fundamental misunderstanding of what a fraction represents (parts of a whole vs. a set of coordinates).*
