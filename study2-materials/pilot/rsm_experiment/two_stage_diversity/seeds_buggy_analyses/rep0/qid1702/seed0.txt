### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Variable Swapping" (Substitution Error)

The specific misconception is a **Substitution Error**—more precisely, **Variable Swapping**. A student with this bug knows they must replace a letter with the number provided, but they automatically substitute the value into the first variable listed ($x$) rather than the specific variable designated in the table ($y$).

This is a highly common procedural bug for Year 9 students because of a deep-seated mental habit where $x$ is viewed as the "input" (independent variable) and $y$ as the "output." Despite the table clearly marking $y = 0.5$, the student's procedural "autopilot" substitutes $0.5$ for $x$.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Workings
A student with the **Variable Swapping** bug would perform the following steps:

1.  **Read the value:** See $0.5$ in the table.
2.  **Misidentify the variable:** Assume $x = 0.5$ because $x$ usually comes first/is the input.
3.  **Substitute incorrectly:** Replace $x$ with $0.5$ in the equation:
    $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$
4.  **Solve for the remaining variable:**
    *   $5 - 6y = 30$
    *   Subtract 5 from both sides: $-6y = 25$
    *   Divide by -6: $y = \frac{25}{-6}$
    *   Convert to decimal: $y = -4.166...$ (the student might round this or realize it doesn't match perfectly).

**OR (more likely at this level), they make a secondary sign error during solving:**
1.  **Incorrect substitution:** $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30$.
2.  **Ignoring the negative sign (a "sign detachment" bug):** Treating $-6y$ as $6y$.
3.  $6y = 30 - 5 \rightarrow 6y = 25$.
4.  $y = 25 \div 6 = 4.166...$ (Looking at the options, they see **$3.3$** and think $10/3$, or they perform the division slightly incorrectly/round up).

**Actually, there is a more direct path to Option C ($3.3$):**
A student might rearrange the formula to $x = \dots$ first but do it incorrectly, or they calculate:
$10x = 30 + 6(0.5)$
$10x = 30 + 3$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$
**Wait, that is the correct calculation!**

**The true misconception leading to Option A ($4.25$):**
If the student follows the **Variable Swapping** bug and forgets the negative sign in front of the 6:
1. $10(0.5) + 6y = 30$
2. $5 + 6y = 30$
3. $6y = 25$
4. $y = 4.16...$

**Correction: Let’s look at Option C again.**
If the student replaces $x$ with $0.5$:
$10(0.5) - 6y = 30$
$5 - 6y = 30$
$-6y = 25$
$y = -4.16$

If the student calculates correctly ($y=0.5$):
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$

**The Misconception leading to Option A (4.25): "The Additive-Inverse Sign Slip"**
If the student substitutes $y=0.5$ correctly but fails to add $3$ to both sides, instead **subtracting** it:
1. $10x - 3 = 30$
2. **Mistake:** $10x = 30 - 3$ (instead of $30 + 3$)
3. $10x = 27$
4. $x = 2.7$ (**Option D**)

If the student **mistakes
