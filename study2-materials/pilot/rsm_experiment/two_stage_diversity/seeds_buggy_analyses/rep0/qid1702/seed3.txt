As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific "buggy procedure" prevalent among students in the 13–14 age range (Year 9).

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The Sign-Flip Omission (Inverse Operation Bug)
The misconception here is a **procedural error in solving linear equations**, specifically involving the failure to invert the sign when moving a constant across the equals sign. In this case, it is the failure to realize that subtracting a negative value is equivalent to adding.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Working
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:

*   **Step 1 (Substitution):** The student correctly identifies that $y = 0.5$ and substitutes it into the equation:
    $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
*   **Step 2 (Multiplication):** The student correctly calculates $6 \times 0.5$ to get $3$:
    $10x - 3 = 30$
*   **Step 3 (The Bug):** Instead of performing the inverse operation of adding 3 to both sides, the student sees the minus sign and subconsciously "combines" the numbers as they appear, or mistakenly subtracts 3 from 30. They think: *"I have 30, and I see a 3, so I take it away."*
    $10x = 30 - 3$
    $10x = 27$
*   **Step 4 (Final Division):** The student divides by 10:
    $x = 2.7$

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: 2.7**.

(The correct calculation should be $10x = 33$, leading to $x = 3.3$, which is Option C).

### 4. How Natural/Attractive is this Error?
This error is **highly attractive** because it creates a "clean" path to a plausible-looking decimal. In a UK Year 9 classroom, this is one of the most common mistakes in algebra:

*   **Sense of Correctness:** The result, $2.7$, feels "correct" because it is a simple one-decimal-place number, much like the $0.5$ provided in the question. 
*   **Lack of Friction:** Because $30 - 3 = 27$ is such a "friendly" mental calculation, the student performs it fluently and is unlikely to stop and check their logic. 
*   **Visual Distraction:** Students often focus on the symbols currently on the page. They see $-3$ and $30$; their brain performs a "shorthand" subtraction rather than the formal algebraic inverse.

The student would likely not realize they went wrong because the result is sitting right there as an option, which provides **false validation** of their buggy procedure.
