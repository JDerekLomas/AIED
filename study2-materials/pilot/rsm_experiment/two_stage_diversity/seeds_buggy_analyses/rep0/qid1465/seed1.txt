In the context of the UK Year 9 curriculum, a common pitfall arises from a rigid, literal interpretation of the order of operations acronym (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Strict Addition over Subtraction"
The misconception is the belief that **Addition must always be performed before Subtraction** because the letter 'A' precedes 'S' in BIDMAS/BODMAS. 

In reality, Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be performed from left to right. A student with this "bug" treats them as two distinct hierarchical levels rather than a single group.

### 2. The Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would process the expression $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$ in the following order:

*   **Step 1: Multiplication.** They correctly identify that multiplication comes before addition/subtraction.
    *   $4 \times 2 = 8$
    *   The expression now looks like: $3 - 5 + 8$
*   **Step 2: Addition (The Error).** Because 'A' comes before 'S', they prioritise the addition of the 5 and the 8, often ignoring the minus sign attached to the 5 or treating it as a separator.
    *   $5 + 8 = 13$
*   **Step 3: Subtraction.** Finally, they subtract their result from the initial 3.
    *   $3 - 13 = -10$

### 3. Which Answer Option?
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: -10**. 
*(For comparison: The correct method—Addition and Subtraction left-to-right—would yield $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 8 = 6$, which is Option A).*

### 4. How Attractive/Natural is this error?
This is one of the most common and "sticky" errors in early secondary mathematics for several reasons:

*   **Mnemonically Induced:** The acronym itself (BIDMAS) provides a sequential blueprint. A student following the "rules" they were taught feels they are being mathematically rigorous by sticking to the alphabetical order of the letters.
*   **Avoidance of Negatives:** By adding 5 and 8 first, the student produces a large positive number (13), postponing the "scary" subtraction until the very end. 
*   **Confidence level:** A student who arrives at -10 often feels **highly confident**. Unlike a student who might make a calculation error and get a random number, the student who follows a "Strict BIDMAS" approach feels they have correctly applied a law of mathematics. Because -10 is listed as a distractor (Option D), it reinforces their belief that their systematic process worked perfectly; they are unlikely to realise they have made an error unless prompted to solve it using a number line from left to right.
