In the context of the UK Year 9 curriculum, where students are expected to be proficient with the Order of Operations (BIDMAS), a highly specific and common misconception involves the interpretation of the **Left-to-Right Convention** in relation to Addition and Subtraction.

### 1. The specific misconception: "A before S" (Strict Literal BIDMAS)
The misconception is the **Strict Priority of Addition over Subtraction**. 

In the acronym **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction), students often believe that because 'A' comes before 'S', addition must *always* be performed before subtraction, regardless of their position in the expression. They fail to realise that Addition and Subtraction carry equal priority and should be performed left-to-right.

### 2. Step-by-step procedural error
A student with the **Strict Priority** bug would approach the expression $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$ as follows:

*   **Step 1 (Multiplication first):** The student correctly identifies that multiplication takes priority. They calculate $4 \times 2 = 8$. 
    *   *Expression remains:* $3 - 5 + 8$.
*   **Step 2 (Addition priority):** Looking at the remaining operators ($-$) and ($+$), the student observes 'A' before 'S' in BIDMAS. They isolate the addition part: $5 + 8$.
    *   *Calculation:* $5 + 8 = 13$.
*   **Step 3 (Final subtraction):** The student now subtracts their result from the initial number.
    *   *Calculation:* $3 - 13$.
*   **Step 4 (Negative result):** $3 - 13 = -10$.

### 3. Answer option
This specific misconception leads directly to **Option D: -10**.

*(Note: The correct answer, Option A, is found by doing $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 8 = 6$.)*

### 4. Attractiveness of the error
This error is **highly natural and extremely attractive** to Year 9 students for several reasons:

*   **Linguistic Priming:** The very acronym we teach them to help them (BIDMAS/BODMAS) suggests a hierarchy that does not exist. To a student, if M comes before A, and A comes before S, it is entirely logical to follow that sequence rigidly.
*   **Avoidance of Negatives:** By performing $5+8$ first, the student creates a single, larger positive number. If they followed the correct left-to-right rule ($3-5$), they would immediately encounter a negative number ($-2$). Many students subconsciously choose paths that delay or avoid dealing with directed numbers.
*   **False Confidence:** Unlike an error that leads to a "messy" decimal, -10 is a "clean" integer. Because it appears exactly as one of the multiple-choice options, the student would feel an immediate sense of validation and is unlikely to check their logic or realize they have misapplied the rule.
