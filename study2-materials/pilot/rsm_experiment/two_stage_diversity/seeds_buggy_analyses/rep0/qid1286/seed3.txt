As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified the following specific error for this Year 9 question.

### 1. The Misconception: "Multiplicative Inversion" (Incorrect Division Priority)

The specific bug is a failure in the **multiplicative inverse procedure during transposition**. Students often struggle when the subject they are isolating is part of a term involving both a fraction ($\frac{4}{3}$) and a product ($\pi$). 

Instead of multiplying by the reciprocal of the coefficient ($ \frac{3}{4\pi} $), the student mistakenly believes that because they are "moving" the coefficient to the other side of the equals sign, the *top* of the fraction and the $\pi$ must stay together in the numerator, while the *bottom* of the fraction stays in the denominator. Essentially, they are moving symbols without applying inverse operations to the values.

### 2. The Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would work as follows:

1.  **Recall the formula:** $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ (The student correctly identifies the starting point).
2.  **Isolate the variable ($r^3$):** To get $r^3$ on its own, the student knows they need to "move" the $\frac{4}{3}$ and the $\pi$ to the side with the $V$.
3.  **The "Transfer" Bug:** Instead of multiplying $V$ by 3 and dividing by $4\pi$, the student treats the $\frac{4}{3}\pi$ as a block where the components stay in their relative vertical positions. They "drag" the $\frac{4}{3}\pi$ across the equals sign and multiply it directly against $V$ (essentially treating "changing sides" as just "moving position"). 
    *   *Calculation:* $V \times \frac{4}{3}\pi = \frac{4V\pi}{3}$.
4.  **The Final Step:** To solve for $r$, they take the cube root of their expression.
    *   *Result:* $\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}}$

### 3. Corresponding Answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option A**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly natural** for a Year 9 student and is rarely self-corrected because:

*   **Visual Familiarity:** In Option A, the $4$, $V$, and $\pi$ are all "on top" and the $3$ is "on the bottom," which looks very similar to the original formula ($V = \frac{4 \pi r^3}{3}$). The student feels they have preserved the "shape" of the formula.
*   **"Top stays Top":** Many students use a primitive "sliding" rule for algebra rather than inverse operations. Because $4$ and $\pi$ are in the numerator of the original formula, they feel it is "logical" for them to remain in the numerator of the new expression.
*   **The "Multiplying" Default:** Students often associate rearranging with multiplication rather than division. Since $V$ is on the left, and $\frac{4}{3}$ is the coefficient, their instinct is to multiply the two together rather than divide $V$ by the fraction.

The student would likely feel confident in this answer because the resulting expression contains all the "correct ingredients," and they may not realize that they have mathematically tripled the radius's value rather than isolating it.
