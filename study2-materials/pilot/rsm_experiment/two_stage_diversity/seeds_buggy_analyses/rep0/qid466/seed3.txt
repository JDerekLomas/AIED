As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific "bug" that is highly common among UK Year 9 students.

### 1. The Misconception: "Reciprocals must have opposite signs" (Confusion between Negative Reciprocal and Reciprocal)

The specific misconception is the **confusion between the Multiplicative Inverse (Reciprocal) and the Negative Reciprocal.** 

In Year 9, students are often introduced to the geometry of perpendicular lines, where they learn that the gradient of a perpendicular line is the "negative reciprocal" (e.g., if one gradient is $\frac{3}{4}$, the other is $-\frac{4}{3}$). Because this is a fresh and high-priority skill in their curriculum, students often over-generalise the rule. They mistakenly believe that to "undo" or "invert" any fraction, they must swap both the numerator/denominator **and** the sign.

### 2. The Step-by-Step Error Process
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:

1.  **Identify the Goal:** The student sees that $-\frac{3}{4}$ is being multiplied by something to reach a result.
2.  **Recall the Inverse Rule:** They recognize they need the "inverse" of the fraction to get back to 1 (or -1). 
3.  **Apply the Over-generalised Rule:** They recall the phrase "flip it and change the sign" from their coordinate geometry lessons.
4.  **Perform the Operation:** 
    *   They "flip" $-\frac{3}{4}$ to get $-\frac{4}{3}$.
    *   They "change the sign" from negative to positive, resulting in $+\frac{4}{3}$.
5.  **Conclusion:** They decide that $+\frac{4}{3}$ is the required value because it is the "complete opposite" of the starting fraction.

### 3. Corresponding Answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: $\frac{4}{3}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **extremely attractive** and rarely triggers an immediate "self-correction" mechanism in the student for several reasons:

*   **Psychological Symmetry:** Students often find $\frac{4}{3}$ more satisfying than $-\frac{4}{3}$ because it creates a "balance" between the negative sign in the question and the positive sign in the answer. They may mistakenly apply the logic that "a negative times a positive stays negative," which matches the $-1$ in the equation.
*   **The "One" Confusion:** Because the target is $-1$ (rather than $+1$), the student doesn't realize they have already "used up" the negative sign. If the target were $+1$, they might correctly choose a negative times a negative. However, seeing a $-1$ on the right side of the equals sign makes them feel that having only one negative sign in the calculation (on the $-\frac{3}{4}$) is correct.
*   **Confidence:** Unlike a student who is guessing, a student with this "buggy procedure" feels they are applying a sophisticated mathematical rule (the perpendicular gradient rule). They are unlikely to realize they've gone wrong because their answer "looks" mathematically professional.
