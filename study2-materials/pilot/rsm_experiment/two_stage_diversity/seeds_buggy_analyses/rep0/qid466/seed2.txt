As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific error frequent in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum (Years 7–9), where students are transitioning from basic fraction arithmetic to algebraic manipulation and directed numbers.

### 1. The Misconception: "Sign Matching via Addition/Subtraction"
The specific bug is the **"Preservation of Negative Identity."** Students often conflate the rules for *adding* directed numbers with the rules for *multiplying* them. 

Specifically, the student believes that to keep an answer negative, the input "modifier" (the star) must also be negative. They incorrectly apply a logic similar to $-3 - 1 = -4$, where "more negatives keep the result negative," failing to recognise that in multiplication, two negatives yield a positive.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would work through the problem as follows:

1.  **Identify the Inverse:** The student recognises that to turn $\frac{3}{4}$ into $1$, they need the reciprocal. They correctly flip the fraction to $\frac{4}{3}$.
2.  **Evaluate the Sign (The Error):** The student looks at the target answer: $-1$.
3.  **Logical Misstep:** They think, *"The answer is negative, so the number I put in the star must be negative to match it."* 
4.  **Verification (Faulty):** They perform a mental check that mimics addition or physical logic: "I have a negative amount, I multiply it by a negative amount, and that keeps it negative."
5.  **Final Construction:** They combine the reciprocal ($\frac{4}{3}$) with their chosen negative sign to get $-\frac{4}{3}$.

### 3. The Corresponding Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option B: $-\frac{4}{3}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness and Self-Correction
This is a highly **"natural" and seductive error** for a Year 9 student for several reasons:

*   **Symmetry:** Students find comfort in visual symmetry. Since the left side of the equation starts with a negative and the right side ends with a negative, it feels "mathematically balanced" to choose a negative value for the star.
*   **The "Double Negative" Overload:** Students are frequently taught "two negatives make a positive" as a chant. However, in a pressured environment, they often misremember this as "negative plus negative stays negative" or simply apply the sign of the target to the missing value.
*   **Likelihood of Realisation:** The student is **highly unlikely** to realise they are wrong. Because $-\frac{4}{3}$ is the reciprocal, it satisfies the "size" of the number (turning $\frac{3}{4}$ into $1$), which provides a false sense of security. Without a rigorous check (where they actually calculate $-\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{4}{3} = +\frac{12}{12} = 1$), the sign error remains invisible to them. They will walk away confident that they solved for both the fraction and the sign correctly.
