As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific "buggy procedure" frequently seen in UK Year 9 students when dealing with rational numbers and reciprocals.

### 1. The Misconception: "The Sign-Flip Reciprocal"
The student conflates two distinct operations: finding the **multiplicative inverse** (the reciprocal) and finding the **additive inverse** (the negative). 

In their mental model, to "undo" or "cancel" a fraction, they believe they must flip it upside down **and** change its sign. They mistakenly believe that a negative number must be multiplied by a positive number to "stay negative" or, conversely, they believe a full inverse requires changing "everything" about the number.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Logic
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:
*   **Step 1:** Observe the equation $-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$ and recognise that the result is $-1$. 
*   **Step 2:** Identify that they need to find the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$ to make the numerical value $1$. They correctly flip the fraction to $\frac{4}{3}$.
*   **Step 3 (The Error):** Look at the negative sign in front of $-\frac{3}{4}$. They feel that to "balance" the equation or to perform a complete "opposite," they should change the sign. They think: *"The first number is negative, so to get back to a standard unit, the second number should be positive."*
*   **Step 4:** They conclude that $\star = +\frac{4}{3}$ because they have "flipped the fraction and flipped the sign."

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: $\frac{4}{3}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is a highly "natural" error for a Year 9 student, and they would be **very unlikely** to realise they went wrong without checking their work via substitution. There are three reasons why this is so attractive:

*   **Linguistic Confusion:** Students often hear "opposite" used for both negative numbers and reciprocals. If they are told to use the "opposite" of $-\frac{3}{4}$, they often apply every opposite they know (sign and orientation).
*   **The "Multiplying by Negatives" Rule:** Many students have a half-remembered rule: *"A negative and a positive make a negative."* Because the target answer is $-1$ (a negative), they intuitively feel that they should multiply the negative $-\frac{3}{4}$ by a **positive** number to keep the result negative. They forget that the multiplicative identity property ($a \times \frac{1}{a} = 1$) is the primary goal, and they focus on the "sign rules" instead.
*   **Over-generalization:** In previous years, they learned that to get back to $0$ (the additive identity), you change the sign ($-\frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = 0$). They incorrectly port this "sign-changing" logic into a multiplication problem where the goal is $1$ (the multiplicative identity).
