As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific error frequent in UK Year 9 classrooms (ages 13–14), where students are transitioning from basic fraction arithmetic to algebraic manipulation and directed numbers.

### 1. The Misconception: "Sign Matching via Addition/Subtraction Logic"
The specific procedural bug is **Misapplying Additive Inverse properties to a Multiplicative Inverse problem.** 

Many students at this level conflate the rules for "cancelling out" a number. When they see a negative number and a goal of $-1$, they instinctively believe the operation requires a positive value to "balance" or "keep" the sign. Specifically, they may incorrectly apply the rule for addition—where a negative plus a positive moves toward zero—to a multiplication context.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Work-through
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:

*   **Step 1:** Look at the target value, $-1$. They notice it is negative.
*   **Step 2:** Look at the first term, $-\frac{3}{4}$. They see it is also negative.
*   **Step 3:** The student recalls a "rule" that "a negative times a negative makes a positive." 
*   **Step 4:** They conclude: "Since my answer must be negative ($-1$), I cannot multiply by another negative, or the answer would turn into a positive. Therefore, the star must be a **positive** number."
*   **Step 5:** They recognize the digits $3$ and $4$ need to "flip" to reach $1$ (the reciprocal property), leading them to $\frac{4}{3}$.
*   **Step 6:** Combining the logic from Step 4 (it must be positive) and Step 5 (it must be a reciprocal), they select $\frac{4}{3}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: $\frac{4}{3}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly natural and extremely attractive** to Year 9 students. 

At this stage, students have had the rule "Two negatives make a plus" drilled into them. Without deep fluency in algebraic structures, they apply this as a superficial pattern-matching tool. They see one negative sign in the question ($-\frac{3}{4}$) and one negative sign in the answer ($-1$); to their logic, the "negative quota" is already filled. Adding another negative would "cancel out" the existing one.

The student would likely **not realize they went wrong.** In their mind, they have successfully navigated two distinct hurdles: the "fraction flip" (reciprocals) and the "sign rule." Because they accounted for both, they will feel a high degree of confidence in Option A, failing to realize that in multiplication, $minus \times positive = minus$. They have confused the requirement of the *product* with the requirement of the *process*.
