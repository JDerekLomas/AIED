As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I identify the following buggy procedure for this specific problem:

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Reciprocal Negation Overload"
The student understands the concept of the **multiplicative inverse (the reciprocal)** but confuses it with the concept of the **additive inverse (changing the sign)**. 

Students are often taught that to "undo" a fraction, they should "flip it." They are also taught that "two negatives make a positive." This leads to a bug where the student over-applies sign-reversal logic: they believe that to get to a negative answer, they must switch the sign of the operator, even if a negative is already present.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would work through the problem as follows:
*   **Step 1:** Look at $-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$ and identify that the target is a negative number $(-1)$.
*   **Step 2:** Observe the initial term is already negative $(-\frac{3}{4})$.
*   **Step 3:** Recall the rule for finding a reciprocal: "To get to 1, I need to flip the fraction to $\frac{4}{3}$."
*   **Step 4 (The Error):** The student thinks, *"I want my answer to stay negative. If I use a negative times a negative, it becomes a positive. Therefore, I must use a positive number to keep the final answer negative."*
*   **Step 5:** They select the positive reciprocal to ensure the calculation is $(- ) \times (+ ) = (-)$.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: $\frac{4}{3}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is an **extremely attractive and "natural" error** for a Year 9 student. 
*   **Logical Consistency:** From the student's perspective, they have checked their signs. They know that $(-) \times (-) = (+)$, and since they see a negative sign in the question and a negative sign in the answer, they consciously *avoid* the negative choice (Option B) to prevent the "double negative" from turning the answer into a $+1$.
*   **Lack of Realization:** The student is unlikely to realize they are wrong because their logic feels mathematically "safe." They have successfully performed the "flip" (showing knowledge of reciprocals) and successfully applied a sign rule (even though they applied it to a situation where it wasn't needed). They will feel they have balanced the equation correctly, whereas the correct answer ($-\frac{4}{3}$ turning the product into $+1$) actually feels "wrong" to a student who hasn't fully mastered the distinction between solving for $1$ and solving for $-1$.
