As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent procedural error known as the **"Component-Wise Addition with Ignored Common Denominators"** (or more simply, **Adding the "Across" way**).

### 1. The Misconception: The "Across" Addition Bug
The student treats a fraction addition problem like a multiplication problem or a simple string of integers. Instead of finding a common denominator (which requires scaling the fractions), the student simply adds the two numerators together to get the new numerator, and adds the two denominators together to get the new denominator. This stems from a misapplication of addition rules, treating parts of a fraction as independent whole numbers.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the problem in these distinct stages:
1.  **Add the whole numbers:** The student looks at the integers $2$ and $2$ and adds them correctly: $2 + 2 = 4$.
2.  **Add the numerators:** The student looks at the numerators $7$ and $1$ and adds them together: $7 + 1 = 8$.
3.  **Add the denominators:** The student looks at the denominators $10$ and $4$ and adds them together: $10 + 4 = 14$.
4.  **Combine the results:** The student puts these components back into a mixed number format to get $4 \frac{8}{14}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $4 \frac{8}{14}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is an **extremely "attractive" and natural error** for a Year 9 student for several reasons:

*   **Logical Consistency (in their mind):** It follows the same logic as the "Addition of Whole Numbers" (columns) and the "Multiplication of Fractions" (top $\times$ top, bottom $\times$ bottom). The student feels they are being consistent with other mathematical rules they have learned.
*   **Path of Least Resistance:** Finding the lowest common multiple (LCM) of 10 and 4 (which is 20) requires multiple cognitive steps (multiplication and then addition). The "Across" method is much faster and requires less mental effort.
*   **False Verification:** Because the student sees their exact result listed as an option (Option D), they experience a surge of "confirmation bias." They are unlikely to realize they are wrong because the presence of the answer among the choices validates their flawed process. To a struggling student, "the answer is there, so I must have done it right."
