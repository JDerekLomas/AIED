As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent procedural error frequently seen in UK Key Stage 3 students.

### 1. The Misconception: "Independent Integer and Denominator Addition"
This is a specific type of **additive interference**. The student correctly identifies that the whole numbers should be added, but they apply a "naive addition strategy" to the fractions where they treat the numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers. Instead of finding a common denominator, they simply add the "tops" and add the "bottoms."

### 2. The Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:
1.  **Add the whole numbers:** Look at the $2$ and the $2$ and calculate $2 + 2 = 4$.
2.  **Add the numerators:** Look at the numerators of the fractional parts ($7$ and $1$) and calculate $7 + 1 = 8$.
3.  **Add the denominators:** Look at the denominators ($10$ and $4$) and calculate $10 + 4 = 14$.
4.  **Combine:** Stitch the results together to form the mixed number $4 \frac{8}{14}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $4 \frac{8}{14}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness and Self-Correction
This error is **highly attractive** and considered a "natural" extension of how students learn to multiply fractions (where you *do* multiply across). To a Year 9 student who is struggling with cognitive load or who lacks "fraction sense," adding the denominators feels intuitive because it is the same operation being applied to every component of the problem.

**Would the student realize they went wrong?**
Almost certainly not. Because the student arrives at an answer that appears exactly as one of the multiple-choice options, they receive "false positive" feedback. They feel a sense of success because their calculated result ($4 \frac{8}{14}$) matches an available distractor. Unless the student has been trained to estimate (noticing that $\frac{7}{10}$ is more than half and $\frac{1}{4}$ is a quarter, so the total should be near $5$), they will proceed with complete confidence that their logic was sound.
