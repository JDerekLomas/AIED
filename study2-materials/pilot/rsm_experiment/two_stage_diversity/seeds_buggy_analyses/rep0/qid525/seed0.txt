In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), where students are moving from basic arithmetic to algebraic fractions, certain "shortcuts" from earlier years often persist.

### 1. The Misconception: "Independent Denominator Summation" (Add the Across)
The specific misconception is treating the fraction components as independent integers, where the student **adds the numerators together and adds the denominators together.** 

This is a very common "buggy procedure" where the student ignores the requirement for a Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) and treats the fraction bar as a separator rather than a division operator.

### 2. Step-by-Step Working
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:

1.  **Isolate the integers:** The student adds the whole numbers first: $2 + 2 = 4$.
2.  **Add the numerators:** The student looks at the fractions $\frac{7}{10}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$ and adds the top numbers: $7 + 1 = 8$.
3.  **Add the denominators:** The student adds the bottom numbers: $10 + 4 = 14$.
4.  **Recombine:** The student combines the integer and the new "fraction" to get $4 \frac{8}{14}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $4 \frac{8}{14}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness and Self-Correction
**How natural is it?** 
This is arguably the most "natural" error in rational number arithmetic. It stems from a **falsely applied generalization**: because multiplication of fractions allows you to multiply across ($a/b \times c/d = ac/bd$), students intuitively feel that addition should follow the same linear logic. 

**Would the student realize they are wrong?**
Almost certainly not. From the student’s perspective, the logic is consistent and "tidy." 
*   They successfully dealt with the whole numbers ($2+2=4$).
*   They used all the numbers provided in the question.
*   The resulting answer ($4 \frac{8}{14}$) "looks" like a mixed number, satisfying the formatting requirement of the question. 

Unless the student has a strong grasp of **estimation** (e.g., "7/10 is more than a half, and 1/4 is a quarter, so the fraction part must be nearly 1"), they will not notice that $\frac{8}{14}$ is significantly smaller than the $\frac{7}{10}$ they started with. Without that "sense check," the procedure feels mathematically "legal" to them.
