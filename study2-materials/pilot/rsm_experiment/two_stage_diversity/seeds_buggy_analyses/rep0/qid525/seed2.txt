In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), where students are moving from visual fraction models to abstract algebraic manipulation, the following error is one of the most persistent "low-level" hurdles.

### 1. The specific misconception: "The Independent Additive Bug" (Adding across)
This is the procedural error where a student treats the numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers. In the specific context of mixed numbers, it is often called **"Component Addition without Commonality."** Instead of finding a common denominator, the student applies the logic used for multiplying fractions (top $\times$ top, bottom $\times$ bottom) to the addition operation.

### 2. Step-by-step student work
A student with this misconception would process the components of the mixed numbers in isolation:

1.  **Add the whole numbers:** The student looks at the "big" numbers ($2$ and $2$) and adds them together: $2 + 2 = 4$.
2.  **Add the numerators:** The student looks at the top numbers ($7$ and $1$) and adds them together: $7 + 1 = 8$.
3.  **Add the denominators:** The student looks at the bottom numbers ($10$ and $4$) and adds them together: $10 + 4 = 14$.
4.  **Assemble the result:** The student combines these results into a new mixed number: $4\frac{8}{14}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $4\frac{8}{14}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness and "Sensing" the error
This error is **highly attractive** for several reasons:

*   **Consistency with whole numbers:** Adding $22 + 21$ involves adding the tens and the ones separately. The student is attempting to apply this same "place value" logic to fractions (adding the wholes and the parts separately).
*   **False transfer from multiplication:** Students are taught that for $\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d}$, you simply "go across." This is easier to remember than the multi-step process for addition, leading to a "short-circuit" in their memory where they apply the easier rule to the harder operation.
*   **Intuition:** It feels "fair." To a Year 9 student who is struggling with cognitive load, the idea that $10 + 4$ equals $14$ feels more naturally "correct" than the idea that tenths and quarters must be converted into twentieths.

**Would the student realize?**
Likely **not.** The most dangerous aspect of Option D is that it *looks* like a legitimate mixed number. The student will see "4" (which makes sense as $2+2$) and a fraction (which looks like a fraction), and because the answer is sitting there in the multiple-choice list, it provides a "false confirmation" of their logic. They would only realize they were wrong if they performed a "sanity check" (e.g., $7/10$ is more than a half, $1/4$ is a quarter, so the fraction part must be nearly $1$), which many students at this stage do not yet do habitually.
