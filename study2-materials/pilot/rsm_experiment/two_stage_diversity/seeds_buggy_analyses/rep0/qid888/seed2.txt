As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, the most frequent "bug" encountered in this specific expansion task is related to integer arithmetic rules, specifically the **Signs for Multiplication vs. Signs for Addition** error.

### 1. The specific misconception: The "Multiplying Negatives to get a Negative" Bug
This procedural error occurs when a student correctly identifies that $-5$ and $-7$ need to be multiplied to form the constant term, but incorrectly applies the rule for addition (where two negatives stay negative) to the operation of multiplication. 

While they understand the distributive law (FOIL), they struggle with the sign transformation for the constant term $(-5 \times -7)$.

### 2. Step-by-step student workthrough
A student with this misconception would likely follow the **FOIL** (First, Outside, Inside, Last) method:

1.  **First:** $m \times m = m^2$ (Correct).
2.  **Outside:** $m \times -7 = -7m$ (Correct).
3.  **Inside:** $-5 \times m = -5m$ (Correct).
4.  **Simplify Middle Terms:** They combine $-7m - 5m$ to get $-12m$. At this age, most Year 9s are proficient enough to know that moving "further left" on a number line results in $-12$ (Correct).
5.  **Last:** $-5 \times -7$. Here the "bug" triggers. The student thinks: *"Five times seven is 35. Since both numbers are negative, the answer must stay negative."* They record this as **$-35$**.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $m^2 - 12m - 35$**.

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This is an **extremely attractive error** for Year 9 students. 

*   **Consistency Bias:** In the previous step, they combined $-7m$ and $-5m$ to get $-12m$. To the student, it feels "consistent" that two negatives interacting should result in a negative result.
*   **Lack of Internal Conflict:** The student will likely **not realise they went wrong**. They have successfully expanded four terms and simplified the middle; the final sign feels like a minor detail rather than a fundamental breach of arithmetic rules. 
*   **Commonality:** Option D is often the most selected "distractor" in multiple-choice questions for this topic because it rewards the student for getting the $m^2$ and the $-12m$ correct, making them confident in their final choice despite the sign error at the end.
