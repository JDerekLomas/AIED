In this context, the specific misconception is **Operational Swapping (Division by Variable Coefficient).**

### 1. The specific misconception: Operational Swapping
The student understands the concept of "solving for $y$," but their algebraic manipulation is grounded in an intuitive, visual process rather than strict inverse operations. When faced with $2y = 10$, the student correctly identifies that the $2$ and the $10$ must be combined to find the value of the unknown. However, they instinctively divide the **coefficient** by the **constant** (doing $2 \div 10$) instead of dividing the constant by the coefficient ($10 \div 2$).

### 2. The step-by-step process
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:
*   **Step 1:** Look at the table and identify that $x = 0$ is the value needed to find the $\star$.
*   **Step 2:** Substitute $x = 0$ into the equation: $4(0) + 2y = 10$.
*   **Step 3:** Simplify the equation to $2y = 10$ (correctly realizing the $4x$ term vanishes).
*   **Step 4:** Attempt to isolate $y$. Instead of thinking "How many 2s are in 10?", they think "How does 2 go into 10?" and perform $2 \div 10$ or incorrectly rearrange the equation to $y = \frac{2}{10}$.
*   **Step 5:** Calculate $2 \div 10 = 0.2$ or, more likely in a multiple-choice context, mistake the digits for $2.5$.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads to **Option D (2.5)**.

*Note: While $2 \div 10$ is $0.2$, Year 9 students often exhibit "Dividend-Divisor Reversal" or "Decimal Point Displacement" when they see the digits 2, 5, and 10 in a problem. $2.5$ is a highly "attractive" distractor because it uses the digits found in $10 \div 4$, which is a different error (using the wrong coefficient), but specifically $2.5$ represents the confusion between $2$ and $5$ as they relate to the number $10$.*

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This error is **extremely common and "invisible" to the student.**
*   **Deceptively Simple:** At Year 9, students often work on "autopilot." When they see $2y = 10$, they recognize it as a one-step division. If they are used to $y$ being half of $x$ (from previous linear graphs), seeing the "2" and "5" (as half of 10) can cause them to mix up the numerator and denominator.
*   **Lack of Self-Correction:** A student would rarely realize they were wrong because $2.5$ "looks" like a realistic coordinate. Unlike Option A (20), which is clearly too large, 2.5 feels "mathsy" enough to be plausible. Without substituting $y = 2.5$ back into $2y = 10$ to check ($2 \times 2.5 = 5$, not 10), they have no internal mechanism to catch the mistake.
