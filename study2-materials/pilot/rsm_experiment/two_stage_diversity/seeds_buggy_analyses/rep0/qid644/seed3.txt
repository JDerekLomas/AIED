As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a classic "procedural blend" error frequently seen in UK Key Stage 3 classrooms.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The "Operation Confusion" Bug
The specific error is **Additive Interference** (or mixing multiplication with addition). 

When students are presented with algebraic expansion, they are cognitively loaded by multiple rules. A common "buggy procedure" is to correctly identify that they must combine the two constant terms, but to revert to **integer addition** instead of **multiplicative distribution**. Essentially, the student sees the "negative one" and "negative four" and performs $(-1) + (-4)$ instead of $(-1) \times (-4)$.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Thinking
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:
1. **Identify the targets:** They look at the terms indicated by the arrows: $-1$ and $-4$.
2. **Internal Dialogue:** "I need to put these two numbers together. I have a minus one and I have a minus four."
3. **The Calculation:** They conceptualize the movement on a number line or a bank balance. "If I am at negative one and I lose four more, I end up at negative five." 
4. **Conclusion:** They conclude that the constant term in the expansion must be $-5$.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $-5$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive and often "silent."** 
A student would likely **not realize** they have gone wrong for three reasons:

*   **Logical Consistency:** To the student, $-1 - 4 = -5$ is a mathematically true statement. Because the arithmetic is correct, they do not feel the "cognitive dissonance" that usually alerts a student to a mistake.
*   **FOIL/Grid Fatigue:** By the time a Year 9 student reaches the final term of an expansion (the "Last" in FOIL), their working memory is often depleted. They revert to the most basic way of combining numbers—addition—rather than the specific operation required by the algebraic context.
*   **The "Double Negative" Myth:** Many students are taught "two minuses make a plus." A student who is skeptical of that rule might over-correct by thinking, "Well, they are both negative, so the answer *must* stay negative," further reinforcing their confidence in choosing $-5$.
