As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific "bug" that is highly prevalent among UK Year 9 students when moving from linear expressions to expanding quadratics.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The "Operator Confusion" Bug
This is a **procedural consolidation error** where the student correctly identifies the two relevant terms but fails to apply the correct operation. Specifically, the student **adds the terms instead of multiplying them.** 

Because the FOIL (First, Outside, Inside, Last) or Grid Method relies on a mix of multiplication (to expand) and addition (to collect like terms), students often lose track of which operation is required at which step. They treat the terms $(-1)$ and $(-4)$ as a sum to be simplified rather than a product to be calculated.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Process
A student with this misconception would approach the question as follows:
1.  **Identify the terms:** The student looks at the arrows and correctly identifies the numbers as $-1$ and $-4$.
2.  **Select the operation:** Instead of recognizing that "expanding brackets" requires the multiplication of terms, the student thinks, "I need to put $-1$ and $-4$ together."
3.  **Execute the calculation:** The student performs $-1 + (-4)$. 
4.  **Final Result:** They conclude that $(-1) - 4 = -5$.

### 3. Selection
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: -5**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **extremely natural and highly "sticky."** There are three reasons the student would likely not realize they have gone wrong:

*   **Linguistic Priming:** In UK classrooms, students are often taught to "collect" terms. The visual of two negative numbers being combined naturally triggers the "debt" analogy (if I owe £1 and then borrow £4, I owe £5). 
*   **The "Middle Term" Habit:** When expanding $(2p-1)(3p-4)$, the middle term of the final quadratic involves adding (e.g., $-8p + -3p = -11p$). The student erroneously applies this additive logic to the constant term at the end as well.
*   **Absence of Conflict:** Unlike an error that leads to an impossible answer, $-5$ "feels" mathematically sound to a Year 9 student. They have performed a correct calculation (addition of integers); they have simply applied it to the wrong phase of the FOIL process. Because $-5$ is present as an option, it provides immediate **confirmation bias**, making them feel confident in their mistake.
