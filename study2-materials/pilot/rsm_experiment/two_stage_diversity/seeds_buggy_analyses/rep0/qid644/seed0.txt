As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent "buggy procedure" that frequently occurs when students move from additive to multiplicative algebraic structures.

### 1. The Misconception: The "Operation Confusion" (Operator as Sign)
The specific misconception is **mixing operations**, where the student interprets the instruction "multiply the terms" but applies the logic of **addition/subtraction** instead. This often stems from a lack of fluency in integer arithmetic or a subconscious "grouping" of terms where the student performs a simple arithmetic sum of the absolute values of the numbers shown.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would work through the problem as follows:
*   **Step 1:** Look at the two terms indicated by the arrows: $-1$ and $-4$.
*   **Step 2:** Instead of applying the multiplication rule (Negative $\times$ Negative = Positive), the student’s brain switches to a "collection" or "combination" mode. They see "minus 1" and "minus 4" and think in terms of a number line or a bank balance.
*   **Step 3:** They calculate: $-1 - 4$.
*   **Step 4:** They conclude that "1 and 4 makes 5," and because both signs are negative, the result must be negative. 
*   **Step 5:** They arrive at the total of $-5$.

### 3. Selection
This misconception leads directly to **Option D) $-5$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is an **extremely natural and attractive error** for a Year 9 student. 
*   **Cognitive Load:** When expanding brackets (FOIL/Grid method), students are juggling multiple rules simultaneously (coefficients, powers of variables, and sign rules). Under this cognitive load, the brain often defaults to the most basic arithmetic process available: addition.
*   **Visual Lure:** The presence of the two minus signs makes $-5$ feel "correct" because it feels like an accumulation of "negativeness."
*   **Lack of Self-Correction:** The student would likely **not realise** they went wrong. To them, $-1$ and $-4$ "combined" equals $-5$ is a "fact" they have used frequently in previous years (collecting like terms). Without a strong prompt to switch into "multiplication mode," the student perceives their answer as logical and moves on to the next term without a second thought. They are confusing "collecting the constants" with "multiplying the constants."
