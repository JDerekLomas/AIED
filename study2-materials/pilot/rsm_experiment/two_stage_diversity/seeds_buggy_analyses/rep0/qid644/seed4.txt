As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a very common "buggy procedure" relevant to UK Year 9 students (typically ages 13–14) who are moving from arithmetic to algebraic manipulation.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The "Operation Confusion" Bug
The specific misconception is **treating the multiplication of constants as addition**. 

Specifically, when expanding brackets using methods like FOIL (First, Outside, Inside, Last) or the Grid Method, students often fixate on the **signs** of the terms rather than the **operation** required. They perceive the task as "combining" the numbers rather than multiplying them. This is often triggered by the visual layout: the student sees a $-1$ and a $-4$ and their brain performs the calculation $(-1) + (-4)$ or $(-1) - 4$.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Process
A student with this misconception would work through the problem as follows:
*   **Step 1:** Look at the two terms indicated by the arrows: $-1$ and $-4$.
*   **Step 2:** Recognize that both numbers are negative.
*   **Step 3:** Instead of applying the multiplication rule (Negative $\times$ Negative = Positive), the student instinctively "combines" the two values as if they are simplifying an expression or moving along a number line.
*   **Step 4:** They calculate $-1 - 4$. They think: *"I am at minus one and I take away four more,"* or *"A one and a four together makes five, and since they are both negative, the answer must stay negative."*
*   **Step 5:** They conclude the result is $-5$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: -5**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is a **highly natural and "sticky" error** for several reasons:

*   **Linguistic Priming:** When teachers talk about "collecting like terms" in the previous unit, students get used to adding and subtracting. When they transition to "expanding brackets," the sudden shift back to multiplication can be overridden by their more recent practice with addition/subtraction.
*   **Overload:** In a Year 9 classroom, expanding $(2p-1)(3p-4)$ involves four separate multiplications and a final simplification. Under the cognitive load of managing the $p^2$ term and the $p$ terms, the brain often "downgrades" the final constant-multiplication step to a simpler addition task to save mental energy.
*   **Self-Correction Likelihood:** The student is **highly unlikely** to realize they went wrong. To the student, $-5$ feels "right" because it uses both digits ($1$ and $4$) and respects the negative signs. It follows a consistent logic of "negative and more negative equals a bigger negative," which is a rule they use correctly in other contexts. Without a prompt to check if they multiplied or added, they would confidently move on to the next question.
