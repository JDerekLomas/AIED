As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent issue for UK Year 9 students when moving from basic arithmetic to algebraic expansion.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The "Operator-Operation" Confusion
This is a **procedural bug** where the student fails to recognise the relationship between the algebraic structure and the required arithmetic operation. Specifically, while the student knows that "expanding brackets" involves multiplication, they see the negative signs as instructions to subtract the numerical values rather than properties of the terms being multiplied. This is often referred to as the **"Adding instead of Multiplying"** error in FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) contexts.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Logic
A student with this misconception would approach the arrows as follows:
*   **Step 1:** They look at the two terms indicated: $-1$ and $-4$.
*   **Step 2:** They mentally register the "Last" part of the expansion. Instead of multiplying ($(-1) \times (-4)$), they look at the numbers and think about their combined value.
*   **Step 3:** They interpret the task as "putting $-1$ and $-4$ together."
*   **Step 4:** They calculate $-1 - 4$, moving further away from zero on a number line, resulting in $-5$.

### 3. Answer Selection
This misconception leads directly to **Option D) $-5$**.

*(Note: If the student had a secondary misconception—the "Double Negative means Plus" rule misapplied to addition—they might arrive at Option C ($+5$), but Option D is the most common result of the Operator-Operation Confusion.)*

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly natural and "sticky"** for several reasons:
*   **Cognitive Load:** Expanding brackets involves multiple steps (Firsts, Outers, Inners, Lasts). When the brain is focused on the algebraic structure (where to draw the arrows), it often reverts to "System 1" thinking for the arithmetic. Since $-1$ and $-4$ look like a subtraction problem written horizontally, the student performs the simplest operation they see.
*   **Auditory Triggers:** When a student reads the problem in their head, they say "Minus one, minus four." This sounds exactly like a subtraction string, bypassing the "Multiplication" instruction intended by the bracket structure.
*   **Lack of Self-Correction:** A student would rarely realise they went wrong because $-5$ feels like a mathematically sound combination of $1$ and $4$. Unlike a "wild" answer (like $20$), $-5$ appears logically related to the numbers in the bracket, providing the student with a false sense of "fluency."
