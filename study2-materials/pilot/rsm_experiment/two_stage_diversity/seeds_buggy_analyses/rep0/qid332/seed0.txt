As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, here is the identification of a common "bug" related to this Year 9 algebra question.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Selective Multiplication" (Distributive Law Error)
The misconception is the **failure to distribute an operation across all terms on one side of an equation.** In this specific case, it is the belief that when multiplying to remove a denominator, you only need to multiply the fractional term and the term on the other side of the equals sign, rather than multiplying every term in the equation.

### 2. The Step-by-Step Student Working
A student with the "Selective Multiplication" bug would evaluate Katie’s statement as follows:

1.  **Analyze the Equation:** They see $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$.
2.  **Identify the "Blocker":** They recognize that the fraction ($\div 3$) is an obstacle to finding $x$.
3.  **Perform Inverse Operation:** They decide to multiply by 3 to "get rid of the fraction."
4.  **Execute the Buggy Procedure:** 
    *   They multiply $\frac{x}{3}$ by $3$ to get $x$. 
    *   They multiply $12$ by $3$ to get $36$.
    *   **The Error:** They "leave the $-5$ alone" because it isn't part of the fraction.
5.  **Form the Next Line:** They write $x - 5 = 36$.
6.  **Evaluate Tom:** They also see that Tom added 5 to both sides ($\frac{x}{3} = 17$), which they recognize as a standard, valid move.
7.  **Conclusion:** They conclude both methods are mathematically sound.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads the student to choose **C) Both Tom and Katie.**

(The correct answer is actually **A**, because Katie failed to multiply the $-5$ by $3$, which should have resulted in $x - 15 = 36$).

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is an **extremely attractive and natural error** for Year 9 students for several reasons:

*   **The "Undo" Mental Model:** Students often view algebra as "moving" numbers or "undoing" things. To them, the 3 is "under the $x$," so they feel it only affects the $x$. They do not see the equation as a balanced scale where the *entire* left side must be tripled to maintain equality.
*   **Visual Proximity:** The 5 is physically separated from the fraction by a minus sign. Because the 5 doesn't "look" like it is being divided by 3, students feel it is "safe" from the multiplication.
*   **Lack of Verification:** The student would almost certainly not realize they were wrong. The resulting equation ($x - 5 = 36$) looks "cleaner" and "easier" than the original, which gives the student a false sense of progress. Unless they are in the habit of substituting their final answer back into the original equation, the error remains invisible until the work is marked.
