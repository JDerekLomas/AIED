In the context of the UK Year 9 curriculum, a common misconception relates to a literal interpretation of the Order of Operations mnemonic **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction).

### 1. The specific misconception: "Strict Alphabetical Hierarchy" (Addition over Subtraction)

The specific error is the **"Addition before Subtraction" bug**. Many students believe that because the 'A' (Addition) comes before the 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym BIDMAS, addition *must* be performed first regardless of its position in the expression. They fail to understand that Addition and Subtraction have **equal priority** and should be solved from left to right.

### 2. Step-by-step through the question

A student with this misconception would approach the problems as follows:

*   **Problem P (\(4 - 5 + 6\)):**
    *   The student looks at the operations: Subtraction and Addition.
    *   They recall "BIDMAS" and note that 'A' precedes 'S'.
    *   Therefore, they conclude they must perform the addition part first. 
    *   They identify the addition as **\(5 + 6\)**. (Note: They often ignore the minus sign attached to the 5, treating it as a separator).
*   **Problem Q (\(4 + 5 \times 6\)):**
    *   The student looks at the operations: Addition and Multiplication.
    *   They recall "BIDMAS" and note that 'M' (Multiplication) precedes 'A' (Addition).
    *   They correctly identify that the multiplication **\(5 \times 6\)** must be done first.

### 3. The resulting answer option

This specific set of logic leads the student directly to **Option D**:
*   **Problem P:** \(5 + 6\) (Priority given to 'A' over 'S')
*   **Problem Q:** \(5 \times 6\) (Priority given to 'M' over 'A')

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?

This is one of the most common and "sticky" misconceptions in Key Stage 3 mathematics. 

*   **Why it's attractive:** Mnemonics like BIDMAS or BODMAS are designed to simplify complex rules. Because the mnemonic is taught as a linear string of letters, it is mentally "natural" for a student to assume a strict rank-order.
*   **Would they realize?** Likely not. Unlike Problem Q (where performing addition first leads to an answer of 54, which "feels" different), Problem P feels like a standard calculation. A student calculating \(4 - (5 + 6)\) would get \(-7\), while the correct left-to-right calculation \( (4 - 5) + 6 \) is \(5\). Both look like plausible integers. Because the student is "following the rule" as they have interpreted it, they feel a sense of mathematical rigour and are often surprised to learn that BIDMAS actually contains hidden "equal priority" pairings (MD and AS).
