In the context of the UK Year 9 curriculum, where students are expected to have mastered the order of operations (BIDMAS), this question targets a highly specific and persistent error.

### 1. The specific misconception: Rigid Hierarchy Bug (or "A comes before S")
The misconception is the belief that the order of the letters in **BIDMAS** (or BODMAS) represents a **strict, linear priority** where Addition (A) must always be performed before Subtraction (S), regardless of their position in the expression. The student fails to understand that Addition and Subtraction are inverse operations of equal priority and should be performed from left to right.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with the "Rigid Hierarchy Bug" would approach the problems as follows:

*   **For Problem P ($4 - 5 + 6$):**
    *   The student looks at the operators: subtraction ($-$) and addition ($+$).
    *   They recall the BIDMAS acronym: B-I-D-M-**A**-**S**.
    *   Because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym, they conclude that addition **must** happen first.
    *   They isolate the addition part: $5 + 6$.
    *   *Result:* They decide the first calculation is $5 + 6$.

*   **For Problem Q ($4 + 5 \times 6$):**
    *   The student looks at the operators: addition ($+$) and multiplication ($\times$).
    *   They recall BIDMAS: B-I-D-**M**-**A**-S.
    *   Because 'M' comes before 'A', they correctly conclude that multiplication must happen first.
    *   *Result:* They decide the first calculation is $5 \times 6$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This logic leads the student directly to **Option D**.
*(Problem P: $5+6$; Problem Q: $5\times6$)*

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is one of the most "attractive" and natural errors in lower secondary mathematics. It is a **procedural trap** created by the very tool used to teach the concept:

*   **Linguistic Priming:** The English language is read left to right, but the mnemonic "BIDMAS" is also read left to right. This reinforces the idea of a 1-through-6 ranking rather than a tiered structure (Levels: 1. Brackets, 2. Indices, 3. DM, 4. AS).
*   **The "Correct" Feeling:** In Problem Q, the student uses BIDMAS to get $5 \times 6$, which is mathematically correct. This success gives them a false sense of confidence that applying the same "priority rule" to Problem P (choosing Addition first) must also be correct.
*   **Lack of Conflict:** The student would **not** realize they are wrong. They believe they are following a "rule" taught by their teacher. They will likely be confused when they get the answer $-7$ (if they do $4 - 11$) versus the correct answer $5$ (from $4 - 5 = -1; -1 + 6 = 5$), often assuming the negative number means they just need to "try another order" without understanding why.
