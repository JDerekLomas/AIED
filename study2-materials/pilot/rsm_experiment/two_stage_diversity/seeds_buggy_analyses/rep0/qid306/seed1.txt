In the context of the UK Year 9 curriculum, where order of operations is formalised using the acronym **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction), this question targets a highly specific and common error.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: Rigid Hierarchical BIDMAS
The bug is known as the **Rigid Hierarchy misconception**. It is the belief that because ‘A’ (Addition) comes before ‘S’ (Subtraction) in the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS, addition must *always* be performed before subtraction, regardless of their position in the expression.

This stems from failing to understand that Addition and Subtraction have **equal priority** and should be solved from left to right.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Thinking
A student with this misconception would approach the two problems as follows:

*   **Problem P (\(4 - 5 + 6\)):**
    *   The student looks at the operators: Subtraction and Addition.
    *   They recall the BIDMAS acronym: "A comes before S."
    *   Consequently, they believe they must perform the addition first.
    *   **Calculation:** They identify \(5 + 6\) as the first operation. (Note: Many students ignore the negative sign attached to the 5, treating it as \(4 - [5 + 6]\)).

*   **Problem Q (\(4 + 5 \times 6\)):**
    *   The student looks at the operators: Addition and Multiplication.
    *   They recall the BIDMAS acronym: "M comes before A."
    *   **Calculation:** They identify \(5 \times 6\) as the first operation.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads the student to select **Option D**:
*   **Problem P:** \(5 + 6\)
*   **Problem Q:** \(5 \times 6\)

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is extremely **natural and seductive** because it is a direct result of "over-learning" a mnemonic. In UK schools, BIDMAS is often taught as a ladder or a strict list. If a teacher hasn't explicitly emphasized that Addition/Subtraction are "on the same level," the student perceives their logic as mathematically rigorous.

**Would the student realise they were wrong?** 
Absolutely not. In fact, the student would likely feel **more confident** than a peer who chose the correct answer (B). To the student, jumping to the addition in \(4-5+6\) feels like a clever application of a rule they worked hard to memorise. They would only realise the error if they checked their answer on a scientific calculator and saw the discrepancy (\(4 - 5 + 6 = 5\), whereas their rigid method leads to \(4 - 11 = -7\)). Without a calculator, they would see their logic as infallible.
