In the context of the UK Year 9 curriculum, here is an analysis of a highly common misconception regarding the Order of Operations.

### 1. The Misconception: Strict Hierarchical "Addition before Subtraction"
The specific bug is the **misapplication of the BIDMAS (or BODMAS) acronym as a strict literal hierarchy**. 

Many students believe that because the letter 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym, addition **must** always be performed first, regardless of its position in the expression. They fail to understand that Addition and Subtraction possess "equal priority" and should be processed from left to right.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this "Addition First" bug would approach the problems as follows:

**Problem P: $4 - 5 + 6$**
*   The student looks at the acronym BIDMAS and sees 'A' before 'S'.
*   They ignore the left-to-right convention.
*   They identify the addition component first: $5 + 6$.
*   **Step 1:** Add $5 + 6$ to get $11$.
*   **Step 2:** They are left with $4 - 11$ (often resulting in a secondary error or confusion with negatives, but the *first* operation chosen remains $5+6$).

**Problem Q: $4 + 5 \times 6$**
*   The student looks at BIDMAS and sees 'M' (Multiplication) comes before 'A' (Addition).
*   **Step 1:** They correctly identify $5 \times 6$ as the first operation.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads the student to choose **Option D**.

*   **Problem P:** $5 + 6$ (Based on 'A' coming before 'S' in BIDMAS).
*   **Problem Q:** $5 \times 6$ (Based on 'M' coming before 'A' in BIDMAS).

### 4. Attractiveness and Realisation
This is one of the most "attractive" and persistent errors in secondary mathematics. 

*   **Why it is natural:** The acronym BIDMAS is taught as a tool to help students remember order, but the linear nature of language (reading the letters in order) implies a hierarchy that doesn't exist for Addition/Subtraction. 
*   **Would they realise?** No. Students usually feel a high level of confidence when they do this because they are "following the rules" they memorized. Because they have $5+6$ as a clear "island" in the middle of the first problem, it feels like a logical starting point. They only encounter friction when they try to finish Problem P ($4 - 11$) and find a negative result, but by then, the "which calculation first?" question has already been answered incorrectly.
