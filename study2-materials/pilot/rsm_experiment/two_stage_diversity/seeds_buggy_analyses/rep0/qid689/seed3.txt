As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent issue for UK Year 9 students known as **The Inverse Operation Position Bias**.

### 1. The Misconception: "Top-Down" Division Bias (Commutative Property Error)
The most common procedural bug here is the **Division Commutativity Misconception**. Students frequently believe that division, like multiplication or addition, can be performed in any order, or they instinctively believe they must divide the larger number by the smaller number regardless of their position in the equation. In this specific algebraic context, students often default to the rule: **"To get the letter, divide the numbers you see."**

### 2. The Step-by-Step "Buggy" Procedure
A student with this misconception would work through the problem as follows:

*   **Step 1:** Observe the equation $10 = \frac{5}{p}$.
*   **Step 2:** Recognize that to "undo" the equation and solve for $p$, a division operation is required involving the two constants (10 and 5).
*   **Step 3:** Instead of multiplying both sides by $p$ to remove the denominator (the correct algebraic step), the student ignores the position of $p$ as the divisor.
*   **Step 4:** They calculate $10 \div 5$. Because 10 and 5 are "friendly" numbers and 10 divides neatly by 5, the brain gravitates toward this easy calculation.
*   **Step 5:** Conclude that $p = 2$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option C ($p = 2$)**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and arguably the "strongest" distractor for this age group for several reasons:

*   **Number Sense Reflex:** Year 9 students are often taught that $10 \div 5 = 2$ so frequently in lower years that it becomes a "preattentive" fact. When they see a 10 and a 5 in a division structure, "2" is the most cognitively fluent response.
*   **Illusion of Correctness:** Because the result (2) is a whole number (an integer), the student receives a psychological "reward" signal. They assume that if the math "works out nicely," the method must be correct.
*   **Lack of Self-Correction:** Most students at this level do not habitually perform a "check" by substituting their answer back into the original equation ($10 = 5 \div 2$). If they did, they would see that $10 \neq 2.5$. However, because the procedure "felt" like standard algebra (isolating the variable), they rarely suspect an error.

To a Year 9 student, Option A ($0.5$) feels "messy" because it involves decimals, and Option B ($50$) involves a number larger than those in the question. **Option C feels "cleanest," making it the most dangerous trap.**
