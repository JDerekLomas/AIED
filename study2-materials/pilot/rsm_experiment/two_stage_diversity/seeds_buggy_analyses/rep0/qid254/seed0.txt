As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific procedural error that is highly prevalent among Year 9 students when dealing with datasets containing zeros.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Zero is Not a Value" (The Identity Bug)
The misconception is the belief that the number **zero does not count as a data point** because it represents "nothing." This is a subset of the "Non-zero Bias." 

In the context of the mean (Average = Sum ÷ Count), the student correctly understands they need to divide by the number of values, but they mentally filter the dataset to exclude zero. They believe that since adding zero doesn't change the sum, including it in the count "dilutes" or "breaks" the average.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Process
A student with this misconception would approach the question as follows:
*   **Step 1: Identify the values.** They look at the list $0, 1, 3, 4, 7$. 
*   **Step 2: Calculate the sum.** They calculate $1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15$. They ignore the $0$ because adding it doesn't change the total.
*   **Step 3: Determine the divisor ($n$).** They count the "active" numbers: $1, 3, 4, \text{and } 7$. They count 4 items.
*   **Step 4: Formulate the division.** They conclude that because there are only four "real" numbers contributing to the total, the sum must be divided by 4.
*   **Step 5: Selection.** They look for an expression that shows the sum of the non-zero digits divided by 4.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads the student directly to **Option C**:
\[ \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \]

### 4. Attractiveness and Naturalness of the Error
This is an **extremely attractive error** for a Year 9 student, and they are unlikely to realize they have gone wrong without intervention. There are three reasons why this error feels "correct" to them:

1.  **Linguistic Ambiguity:** In everyday English, "nothing" (zero) is the absence of a thing. If a student is asked "How many numbers are there?", their intuition might suggest there are four numbers and a placeholder.
2.  **Lack of Cognitive Dissonance:** Because $15 \div 4 = 3.75$ and $15 \div 5 = 3$, both results look like "sensible" averages for a list ending in 7. The student doesn't receive a "nonsense" result (like an average higher than the largest number) that would trigger a re-evaluation.
3.  **Procedural Over-generalization:** Students are often taught to "ignore zeros" in other contexts, such as leading zeros in decimals or when multiplying by powers of ten. They incorrectly apply this "efficiency" rule to statistics.

To this student, **Option A** looks like an attempt to "trick" them into dividing by 5 just because there are 5 digits written down, even though one of those digits "doesn't count."
