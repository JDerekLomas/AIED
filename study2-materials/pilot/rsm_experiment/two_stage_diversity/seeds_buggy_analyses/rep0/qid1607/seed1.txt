In the context of UK Year 9 algebra, the most common error in this specific problem relates to **inverse operations** when "moving" a constant from one side of an equation to the other.

### 1. The Misconception: "Moving means Adding" (Sign Reversal Error)
The specific bug is the **failure to apply the inverse operation during the isolation of the variable.** 

When students learn the shorthand "move it to the other side," they often develop a mechanical "hitch" where they know a number must move, but they default to the most familiar operation (addition) rather than the inverse of the existing operation (subtraction). In this case, because the $+1$ is "added" to the $k$, the student mistakenly believes they should add it to the 60 to "combine" them.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure of a Student with this Bug
A student with this misconception would perform the following steps:
*   **Initial Thought:** "I need to get $k$ by itself. First, I need to get rid of the fraction."
*   **Step 1:** "The 4 is dividing, so I multiply 15 by 4. $15 \times 4 = 60$. So, $60 = 1 + k$." (**Correct logic**)
*   **Step 2 Error:** "Now I need to move the 1 over to the 60 to leave $k$ alone. Since I am moving it, I will join it to the 60. $60 + 1 = 61$."
*   **Result:** They conclude $k = 61$.

### 3. Which Answer Option This Leads To
This misconception leads directly to **Option A (Only step 1 is correct)**. 

The student identifies that Isaac’s Step 1 followed the rules of algebra (multiplying by the denominator), but since their own internal "buggy" logic matches Isaac's Step 2, they would certify Step 2 as mathematically sound. Therefore, when looking at the options, they would see both steps as "right," which actually corresponds to **Option C**.

*(Correction: If the student possesses the bug themselves, they would select **C** because they believe Isaac is correct. If the student is being asked to identify if Isaac is correct and they have the same bug, they see no error.)*

### 4. How Attractive Is This Error?
This error is **highly attractive** and one of the most common "invisible" errors in Year 9. 

*   **Why it's attractive:** Students often perceive the "1" and the "60" as being on "the same team" once the fraction is gone. There is a psychological urge to sum numbers rather than subtract them, especially when all numbers involved are positive.
*   **Realization:** The student is **highly unlikely** to realize they went wrong. Because $61 = 1 + k$ looks like a "neat" equation, and they followed a consistent (albeit incorrect) mechanical rule, they will feel confident in the answer. Without the habit of **substitution/verification** (plugging 61 back into the original equation: $\frac{1+61}{4} = \frac{62}{4} = 15.5 \neq 15$), the error remains entirely hidden to them.
