As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific "buggy procedure" frequently observed in UK Year 9 students when moving from one-step to two-step equations.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The "Inconsistent Inverse" Bug
The student suffers from a **faulty execution of inverse operations**, specifically regarding the sign change in additive inverses. The "bug" is the belief that moving a term across the equals sign automatically requires **addition**, regardless of the original operation or sign of the constant. In this specific case, the student correctly identifies that 1 must be "moved" to isolate $k$, but they fail to perform the **opposite** operation (subtraction), instead performing the same operation seen or defaulting to addition.

### 2. The Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:

*   **Step 1:** They see the denominator of 4. They correctly recognize that they need to "get rid" of the division by multiplying. They calculate $15 \times 4 = 60$. They write down $60 = 1 + k$. They believe Step 1 is correct.
*   **Step 2:** They look at the equation $60 = 1 + k$. They see the $+1$. Instead of thinking "the inverse of adding 1 is subtracting 1," their mental rule is simplified to "combine the numbers." They see the 60 and the 1 and simply add them because they are on opposite sides, or they think "to move it over, I just put them together."
*   **Calculation:** They perform $60 + 1 = 61$. 
*   **Conclusion:** They arrive at $k = 61$, confirming Isaac’s Step 2.

### 3. The Resulting Answer
This misconception leads the student to select **Option C: Both steps are correct.**

### 4. Attractiveness and Self-Correction
This error is **highly attractive** and cognitively "sticky" for a few reasons:

*   **Confirmation Bias:** Students often focus on the fact that Step 1 is undeniably correct. Once they validate Step 1, they are psychologically predisposed to find a reason why Step 2 is also correct to justify Isaac's working.
*   **Number Sense Illusion:** In the student's mind, $60$ and $61$ are "close together," making the answer feel plausible. Unlike an error that produces a massive or fractional number, 61 feels like a "tidy" algebraic result.
*   **The "Moving" Metaphor:** Many UK students are taught to "move things over the bridge" (the equals sign). If a student has not mastered the idea that the "cost" of the move is an **opposite** operation, they often default to the most basic operation: addition.

**Would the student realize?**
Likely not. A student with this bug rarely checks their answer by **substitution**. If they were to substitute 61 back into the original equation, they would get $\frac{1+61}{4} = \frac{62}{4} = 15.5$. However, at Year 9, students struggling with this procedure often lack the habit of verification, meaning they would remain confident in Option C.
