As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific "buggy procedure" frequently observed in UK Year 9 students when moving from one-step to two-step linear equations.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The "Inverses-Only" Generalisation (Operator Reversal Error)
The student has mastered the concept of "doing the inverse" but lacks the conceptual understanding of "balancing the equation." The specific bug here is **misapplying the inverse operation when isolating the variable in Step 2.** 

Rather than viewing the equation as a balance where an operation is performed on both sides, the student treats the numbers as moveable objects. To "move" the $+1$ away from the $k$, they know they must use the inverse of addition (subtraction), but they incorrectly perform the addition again because they are subconsciously "completing" the number sentence ($60 + 1 = 61$).

### 2. The Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:

*   **Step 1:** They see the fraction bar (division by 4). They correctly identify the inverse as multiplication. They calculate $15 \times 4 = 60$. They successfully write: $60 = 1 + k$.
*   **Step 2:** They look at the expression $1 + k$. They want to isolate $k$. They see the $60$ on the left and the $+1$ on the right. 
*   **The Error:** Instead of subtracting $1$ from $60$ to "undo" the addition, the student’s brain performs a **"Forward Completion"** error. They see the numbers $60$ and $1$ and reflexively add them to "finish" the problem, resulting in $k = 61$. 
*   Essentially, they replace "isolate $k$ by doing the same to both sides" with "combine the available constants using the operation shown."

### 3. Which Answer Option This Leads To
This misconception leads the student to select **A) Only step 1.**

The student will look at Isaac’s work, agree with the multiplication in Step 1, but look at Step 2 and realize that while Isaac's logic resulted in 61, the *actual* math should have been $60 - 1 = 59$. Therefore, they identify Isaac's Step 2 as incorrect.

*(Note: In many diagnostic contexts, this student is considered "partially proficient" because they understand the priority of operations—multiplying by the denominator first—but fail at the final arithmetic shift.)*

### 4. How Natural/Attractive is this Error?
This error is **highly attractive and often goes unnoticed** by the student for two reasons:

*   **Fluency Overload:** Year 9 students are often focusing so hard on the "new" step (multiplying by 4) that they revert to "autopilot" for the easier step. Adding 1 to 60 feels "natural" and yields a clean, positive integer (61), which "looks" like a correct answer in a school context.
*   **Lack of Verification:** Students at this level rarely substitute their answer back into the original equation. If they checked $\frac{1+61}{4}$, they would see $\frac{62}{4} = 15.5$ (not 15). Without this check, the procedural bug remains hidden because the logic of "I used all the numbers in the equation" feels satisfyingly complete.
