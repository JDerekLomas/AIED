In this scenario, the student correctly completes Step 1 but fails in Step 2. Here is the breakdown of the mathematical misconception involved.

### 1. The specific misconception: The "Operation Balance Flip" (Inverse Error)
The specific error is a **misapplication of inverse operations**, specifically when isolating a variable in a one-step linear equation (e.g., $x + a = b$). 

A Year 9 student often learns the "change side, change sign" rule as a rote procedure. The "bug" occurs when the student knows they must move the $1$ to the other side of the equals sign but **performs the same operation instead of the inverse.** In this case, instead of subtracting $1$ to undo the addition, the student adds $1$ because they see an addition sign and instinctively associate the problem with "adding numbers."

### 2. How a student with this misconception would work through the question:
*   **Step 1:** The student recognizes that the $4$ is dividing the right-hand side. They correctly identify that they must multiply $15$ by $4$. They write $60 = 1 + k$. (Step 1 is correct).
*   **Step 2:** The student looks at $60 = 1 + k$. They want to "move" the $1$. Because they see a "$+$" sign or simply perceive $60$ and $1$ as two numbers on opposite sides that need to be combined, they perform $60 + 1$. 
*   **The Logic:** "To solve for $k$, I need to combine $60$ and $1$. $60$ plus $1$ is $61$." They ignore the balancing requirement of subtracting $1$ from both sides, resulting in $61 = k$.

### 3. Answer Option:
This misconception leads the student to choose **Option A: Only step 1.**

The student would identify that Step 1 followed the rules of algebra they are confident in (multiplication), but when they look at Step 2 and compare it to their own internal (flawed) calculation of $61$, they would believe Step 2 is correct. Wait—in this specific prompt's context, the student in the question *is* Isaac. 

If a student **reviewing** Isaac’s work has this misconception, they will agree with Isaac’s mistake and choose **Option C (Both steps are correct).** They will see $60 = 1 + k$ and $61 = k$ as a logical sequence because they also believe you should add the 1.

### 4. How natural/attractive this error is:
This is a highly common and "sticky" error for Year 9 students. 
*   **Attractiveness:** It is very attractive because $60 + 1 = 61$ is a "cleaner" and more intuitive mental calculation than $60 - 1 = 59$. Students often favor the operation that feels most additive or "forward-moving."
*   **Realization:** The student is **highly unlikely** to realize they went wrong. Because $61$ is so close to $60$, the answer "looks" reasonable. Unless the student is explicitly taught to check their answer by substituting $k = 61$ back into the original equation ($62 / 4 \neq 15$), the procedural flow feels correct to them, and they will proceed with total confidence.
