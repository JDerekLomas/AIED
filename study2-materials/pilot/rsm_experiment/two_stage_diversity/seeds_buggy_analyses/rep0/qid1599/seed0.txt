As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a primary error that UK Year 9 students (ages 13–14) frequently make during the transition from arithmetic arithmetic to algebraic notation.

### 1. The Misconception: "Order of Operations Detachment" (Priority Bug)
The specific misconception is the **misapplication of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS) when converting linear expressions to fractional form.**

Students often believe that the division symbol ($ \div $) only applies to the term immediately preceding it and immediately following it, failing to recognize the parentheses as a "packaging" mechanism that binds $(h+4)$ into a single denominator. In this case, the student treats the $+4$ as a separate entity that exists outside the division structure.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the question as follows:

*   **Step 1:** Look at the expression $c \div (h+4)$.
*   **Step 2:** See the $c \div h$ part first and immediately translate it into the fraction $\frac{c}{h}$, as they have been taught that a fraction bar represents division.
*   **Step 3:** See the remaining $+4$ and assume that since it is "added on," it should sit alongside the fraction they just created.
*   **Step 4:** Disregard the parentheses because they believe the purpose of the parentheses was merely to separate the symbols, and "since I've dealt with the $h$, the brackets are now gone."
*   **Result:** They combine the parts to form $\frac{c}{h} + 4$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer
This misconception leads the student directly to **Option C: $\frac{c}{h} + 4$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly natural and "sticky"** for several reasons:

*   **The Left-to-Right Bias:** Students are conditioned to read from left to right. When they reach $c \div h$, they "finish" that calculation in their head before looking at what follows.
*   **Visual Similarity:** Option C looks "tidier" to some students than Option A because the $+4$ remains on the same horizontal line it occupied in the original question.
*   **Misunderstanding "Terms":** Many Year 9 students do not yet view $(h+4)$ as a single "object." To them, it is two separate things (a letter and a number). Therefore, the idea that a single line (the vinculum) can govern both parts is cognitively demanding.

**Would the student realize they were wrong?** 
No. In fact, a student choosing Option C would likely feel confident. They have followed the rules of BIDMAS (Division before Addition) in a literal sense, failing to realize that the division bar in algebraic convention acts as a **grouping symbol** that replaces the need for parentheses. They would view Option A as "wrong" because the division bar seems to be "acting on" the 4, which they feel should be separate.
