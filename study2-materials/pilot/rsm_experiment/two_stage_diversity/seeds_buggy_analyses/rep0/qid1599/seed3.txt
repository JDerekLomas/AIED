As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I identify the following buggy procedure for a UK Year 9 student (approx. 13–14 years old):

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Order of Operations Neglect" (BIDMAS/BODMAS Violation)
Specifically, this is the **Grouping Symbol Blindness**. The student fails to recognise that the fraction bar acts as a vinculum (a grouping symbol) that must encompass the entire expression $h+4$. They interpret the expression as a linear sequence rather than a structure where the division applies to the sum as a single entity.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would likely follow these steps:
1. **Identify the variables:** They see a $c$, a division sign, an $h$, and a $+4$.
2. **Translate to vertical notation:** They know that in algebra, $c \div h$ is written as $\frac{c}{h}$.
3. **Append the remainder:** They look at the remaining part of the expression $(+4)$. Instead of seeing the parentheses as a command to group $h+4$ together under the fraction bar, they treat the $+4$ as a "floating" term that exists independently of the division.
4. **Construct the result:** They write $\frac{c}{h}$ and then simply place the $+4$ next to it.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option C: $\frac{c}{h} + 4$**.

### 4. Attractiveness and Self-Correction
This is a **highly natural and "sticky" error** for several reasons:
*   **Linear Reading:** Students often read math left-to-right like a sentence. If they process "c divided by h" first, they commit to the fraction $\frac{c}{h}$ before they even process the $+4$.
*   **The Parentheses Illusion:** In UK Year 9, students are often taught that the goal of algebra is to "get rid of brackets." To them, writing the expression without parentheses feels like "progress." They believe that by moving to fraction notation, the brackets are no longer necessary, but they lack the structural understanding that the long horizontal fraction bar replaces the function of the brackets.
*   **Lack of Conflict:** The student would likely **not realise they went wrong**. To them, $\frac{c}{h}+4$ looks "algebraic" because it uses a fraction bar and variables. Unless they are asked to substitute numbers (e.g., if $c=10, h=1$, then $10 \div 5 = 2$, but $\frac{10}{1} + 4 = 14$), the logical inconsistency remains hidden. They perceive Option A and Option C as visually similar ways of saying the same thing, often choosing C because it matches their left-to-right reading order.
