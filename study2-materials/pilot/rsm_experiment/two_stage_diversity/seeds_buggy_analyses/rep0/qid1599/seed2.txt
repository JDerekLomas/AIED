As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific "buggy procedure" prevalent among UK Year 9 students regarding **Operator Precedence in Algebraic Fractions**.

### 1. The Misconception: "Order of Operations Deconstruction" (Parenthesis Neglect)
The specific misconception is the belief that algebraic fractions are written by simply swapping the division sign for a vinculum (fraction bar) between the two closest terms, rather than treating the parenthetical expression as a single inseparable denominator. The student fails to recognise that the vinculum acts as a **grouping symbol** that must encompass the entire expression $(h+4)$.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would process the expression $c \div (h+4)$ as follows:

1.  **Scanning for the operator:** The student identifies the $\div$ symbol as the primary action to be converted into "algebraic form" (a fraction).
2.  **Isolated Translation:** Instead of seeing $(h+4)$ as a single block, they interpret the calculation as "Divide $c$ by $h$."
3.  **Application of Fraction Bar:** They rewrite $c \div h$ as $\frac{c}{h}$.
4.  **Appendage of Constants:** They see the $+4$ remaining outside the core division. Because they are often taught that "algebra removes brackets," they simply "drop" the $+4$ at the end of their new fraction.
5.  **Result:** They produce $\frac{c}{h} + 4$.

### 3. Selection
This misconception leads the student directly to **Option C**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and deceptive for several reasons:

*   **Linear Thinking:** Students often read mathematics from left to right like a sentence. $c$ is first, $\div h$ is second, and $+ 4$ is third. Option C follows this linear "chronology" perfectly.
*   **The "Vanishing Bracket" Illusion:** Students at this level are often drilled to "remove brackets." They may incorrectly assume that converting to a fraction is the method by which the brackets are removed, rather than understanding that the vinculum *replaces* the need for brackets.
*   **Aural Feedback:** If a student reads Option C aloud as "c over h, plus four," it sounds rhythmically similar to "c divided by h plus four."

The student is **unlikely to realise they are wrong**. In their mind, they have followed the rule of "converting $\div$ to a fraction bar" and "getting rid of the brackets." Without the conceptual understanding that a fraction bar implies a hidden bracket around the entire numerator or denominator, Option C looks more "algebraic" and "finished" to them than Option A.
