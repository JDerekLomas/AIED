In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), students are moving toward fluency with fractions, but foundational errors often persist under pressure.

### 1. The Misconception: "Independent Denominator Summation"
This specific procedural error is the **Additive Denominator Bug**. It occurs when a student correctly identifies that they should add the "like parts" of a mixed number but mistakenly treats the denominator as an independent integer to be summed, rather than a label for the size of the fractional parts.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the calculation in these stages:
*   **Step 1 (Add the Wholes):** The student adds the whole number components: $2 + 1 = 3$.
*   **Step 2 (Add the Numerators):** The student adds the top numbers: $1 + 2 = 3$.
*   **Step 3 (Add the Denominators):** The student treats the denominators as discrete units to be combined: $5 + 5 = 10$.
*   **Step 4 (Combine):** They stitch the results together to form the mixed number $3 \frac{3}{10}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $3 \frac{3}{10}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness and Self-Correction
This is a **highly "natural" and attractive error** for a Year 9 student for several reasons:

*   **False Consistency:** Students have been taught for years that "plus means add." In their experience with integers, decimals, and algebraic terms (e.g., $2x + 1x = 3x$), the operation is applied to everything they see. Applying a "don't add the bottom" rule feels counter-intuitive and like a "special exception" they might forget.
*   **Similarity to Multiplication:** At Year 9, students are learning or revisiting fraction multiplication, where you *do* multiply the denominators ($ \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2}{25}$). The student confuses the rules, subconsciously thinking, "If I multiply denominators during multiplication, I should add them during addition."
*   **The "Sensible" Appearance:** $3 \frac{3}{10}$ "looks" like a sophisticated mixed number. Because the student has performed an operation (addition) on every component of the question, they feel a sense of completion. Unless they have a strong visual/spatial understanding (realising that two sets of fifths cannot suddenly become tenths), they are **highly unlikely to realize they went wrong**, as the procedure they followed was consistent and logical in its own right.
