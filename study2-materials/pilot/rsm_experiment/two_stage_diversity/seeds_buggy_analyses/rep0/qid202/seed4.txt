In the context of UK Year 9 (age 13–14), while many students are proficient with basic fractions, a significant number still struggle with the "rules" of fraction arithmetic versus whole number arithmetic.

### 1. The Misconception: The "Universal Additive Property" (Denominator Summation)
The specific bug here is treating the denominators of fractions as independent whole numbers that must be added, just like the numerators. In mathematical education literature, this is often called the **"Add-Across" error**. 

Students applying this bug do not recognize the denominator as a *unit* or *descriptor of size*, but rather as just another number in the calculation string.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would work through the problem as follows:
1.  **Add the whole numbers:** The student identifies $2$ and $1$ and adds them correctly to get **3**.
2.  **Add the numerators:** The student identifies the $1$ and the $2$ in the fractional parts. They add $1 + 2$ to get **3**.
3.  **Add the denominators:** Instead of keeping the common denominator (which represents the "size" of the slice), the student applies the same additive logic used for the numerators: $5 + 5 = \mathbf{10}$.
4.  **Reassemble:** The student combines these three results to form the mixed number $3 \frac{3}{10}$.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $3 \frac{3}{10}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness and Naturalness of the Error
This is one of the most "natural" errors in mathematics for several reasons:
*   **Consistency Bias:** Students are taught from early primary school that "plus means add everything." In their minds, they are being consistent by adding every digit they see ($2+1$, $1+2$, and $5+5$).
*   **False Logical Symmetry:** They see the logic "Top + Top" and feel it is only "fair" or symmetrical to perform "Bottom + Bottom."
*   **The "Illusion of Progress":** Because $3 \frac{3}{10}$ looks like a standard, tidy mixed number, the student will have high confidence in their answer. Unlike errors that lead to "messy" improper fractions, this result feels "correct" and "simplified."

**Would the student realize they went wrong?**
Almost certainly not. To a student with this bug, the result $3 \frac{3}{10}$ is smaller than the correct answer ($3 \frac{3}{5}$). However, unless they have a strong visual/spatial sense of fractions (e.g., imagining pizzas), they won't realize that adding two sets of "fifths" cannot magically create "tenths." Without a prompt to estimate the size of the result, the procedural "add-across" logic is so satisfyingly simple that it overrides any intuition about the size of the parts.
