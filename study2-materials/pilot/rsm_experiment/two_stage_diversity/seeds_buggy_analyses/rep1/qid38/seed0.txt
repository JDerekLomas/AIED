In the context of UK Year 9 algebraic fractions, a common misconception relates to how students handle unequal denominators when one denominator is a multiple of the other.

### 1. The Misconception: "Adding Across" (The Freshmen’s Sum/The Numerator-Denominator Jump)

The specific procedural error is **Adding the Numerators and Adding the Denominators**. 

Instead of finding a common denominator (which requires multiplying the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 2), the student treats the algebraic components as independent "blocks" to be summed horizontally.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:

1.  **Step 1:** Look at the numerators (3 and 4) and add them together: $3 + 4 = 7$.
2.  **Step 2:** Look at the denominators ($2x$ and $x$) and treat them as like-terms to be added. They calculate: $2x + x = 3x$ (or sometimes they simply combine the symbols if they are less confident with algebra).
3.  **Step 3:** Place the sum of the numerators over the sum of the denominators to form a new fraction.
4.  **Result:** They produce the fraction $\frac{7}{3x}$.

### 3. Which answer option does this lead to?
This misconception leads directly to **Option B: $\frac{7}{3x}$**.

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This error is **highly attractive** and one of the most persistent "bugs" in secondary mathematics. 

*   **Internal Logic:** It feels consistent with how students multiply fractions (where you *do* work horizontally) and how they add integers. The student perceives the "+" sign as an instruction to combine everything on the top and everything on the bottom.
*   **Ease of Use:** It is significantly less cognitively demanding than the correct procedure. The correct method requires identifying that $2x$ is the lowest common multiple, transforming $\frac{4}{x}$ into $\frac{8}{2x}$, and then only adding the numerators. The "Add Across" method bypasses all of these "hidden" steps.
*   **Lack of Realisation:** A student would **not** realize they went wrong. Because the result looks like a "simpler" single fraction and follows a clear (albeit incorrect) pattern, the student would feel confident in their answer. They would see Option B in the list and feel a sense of validation, assuming the question-setter provided it because it is the correct sum of the visible parts.
