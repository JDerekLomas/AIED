In the context of UK Year 9 algebraic fractions, a common and specific error is the **"Universal Additive Error"** (or more simply, **Adding Numerators and Adding Denominators**).

### 1. The specific misconception: Adding Across
The student treats algebraic fractions the same way they might incorrectly treat numerical fractions: by simply adding the numerators and the denominators together. This stems from a lack of understanding that fractions are operators/proportions requiring a common denominator; instead, they view the fraction as two separate integers separated by a bar.

### 2. Step-by-step student work
A student with this misconception would approach the problem like this:

*   **Step 1:** Look at the numerators ($3$ and $4$). Add them together: $3 + 4 = 7$.
*   **Step 2:** Look at the denominators ($2x$ and $x$). Add them together: $2x + x = 3x$.
*   **Step 3:** Place the new numerator over the new denominator to form the single fraction: $\frac{7}{3x}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option B: $\frac{7}{3x}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the error
This is a **highly natural and attractive error** for several reasons:

*   **Low Cognitive Load:** It bypasses the complex need to find a lowest common multiple or scale the second fraction. It feels "logical" because it follows the same rules as multiplying fractions (where you do multiply across).
*   **False "Simplification":** To a Year 9 student, $\frac{7}{3x}$ looks "simpler" and "cleaner" than the correct answer ($\frac{11}{2x}$), which requires a counter-intuitive numerator.
*   **Lack of Self-Correction:** The student would almost certainly **not** realize they went wrong. Because the resulting expression $\frac{7}{3x}$ appears as a distracter in the multiple-choice list, it provides "confirmation bias." They see their result among the options, which reinforces their belief that their "Add Across" procedure was correct. They are unlikely to check their work by substituting a value for $x$ (e.g., if $x=1$, then $1.5 + 4 = 5.5$, but their answer $7/3 = 2.33$), as they are focused on the algebraic manipulation rather than the numerical value.
