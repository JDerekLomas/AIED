In the context of UK Year 9 Algebra (adding algebraic fractions), a common and persistent error is the **"Add-All" Bug** (specifically, adding numerators and denominators independently).

### 1. The specific misconception: "The Universal Addition Rule"
The student treats fractions as a pair of independent integers separated by a line. They apply the logic used for multiplying fractions (top $\times$ top, bottom $\times$ bottom) or the intuitive "add everything" approach. The bug is failing to find a common denominator and instead assuming that $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d}$.

### 2. Step-by-step student work
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:
*   **Step 1:** Look at the two numerators, $3$ and $4$, and add them together: $3 + 4 = 7$.
*   **Step 2:** Look at the two denominators, $2x$ and $x$, and add them together: $2x + x = 3x$.
*   **Step 3:** Place the sum of the numerators over the sum of the denominators.
*   **Result:** $\frac{7}{3x}$.

### 3. Corresponding answer option
This misconception leads directly to **Option B**.

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This error is **highly attractive** and one of the most common mistakes in Key Stage 3. It feels "natural" for several reasons:
*   **Simplicity:** It is the path of least resistance. It requires no knowledge of equivalent fractions or common multiples.
*   **Misapplied Prior Learning:** Students are often taught to multiply fractions by "going straight across." This "Universal Addition" logic feels like a logical extension of that rule.
*   **Lack of Reality Check:** Unlike numerical fractions (where a student might see that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}$ obviously doesn't equal $\frac{2}{4}$), the abstract nature of $x$ makes it harder for a student to use "common sense" to verify the result.

The student would likely feel **very confident** in this answer and would not realize they had made an error, as their result matches Option B perfectly. They would perceive Option A ($\frac{11}{2x}$, the correct answer) as more "complicated" because it involves transforming the second fraction into $\frac{8}{2x}$.
