In the context of UK Year 9 algebraic fractions, a common misconception for this specific question is the **"Add Everything" (or Universal Linear Addition)** bug.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The "Add Everything" Bug
This is a procedural error where a student treats algebraic fractions the same way they might incorrectly treat numerical fractions: by adding the numerators together and the denominators together. The student fails to recognize that a common denominator must be found through multiplication; instead, they view the fraction bar simply as a separator between two independent addition problems.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Working
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:
*   **Step 1:** Look at the numerators ($3$ and $4$) and add them together: $3 + 4 = 7$.
*   **Step 2:** Look at the denominators ($2x$ and $x$) and add them together as if they were terms in an expression: $2x + x = 3x$.
*   **Step 3:** Place the sum of the numerators over the sum of the denominators.
*   **Final Result:** $\frac{7}{3x}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option B**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly natural and extremely attractive** to Year 9 students for several reasons:

*   **Consistency with whole numbers:** Addition is the "easiest" operation. Extending it across the fraction bar feels intuitively balanced and logical to a student who is not yet grounded in the logic of proportional parts.
*   **Misapplication of Algebra Rules:** Year 9 students are often freshly confident in "combining like terms." Seeing $2x$ and $x$ and writing $3x$ feels like a win in an algebra context, making them less likely to question the validity of adding denominators.
*   **Lack of Internal Conflict:** Because the student is following a clear, two-step rule (top + top, bottom + bottom), they will likely feel very confident. Unlike more complex errors (like forgetting to multiply the numerator when finding a common denominator), this procedure leaves no "leftover" numbers or awkward steps, making the student believe they have "simplified" the expression perfectly. They would almost certainly **not realize** they went wrong until the concept of "common units" (denominators) is reintroduced.
