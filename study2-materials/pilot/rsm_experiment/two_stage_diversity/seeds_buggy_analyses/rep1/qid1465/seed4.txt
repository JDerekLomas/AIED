As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific "order of operations" error that is highly prevalent among Year 9 students (approx. age 13–14) in the UK.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "AS" Literalism (Addition before Subtraction)

The name of this bug is **Hierarchical Order Literalism**, specifically applying the "A" before "S" in mnemonics like **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) or **BODMAS**.

Many students incorrectly believe that because "A" appears before "S" in the acronym, they must physically perform all additions in an expression before they perform any subtractions, rather than treating addition and subtraction as equal-priority operations to be solved from left to right.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would work through the question as follows:

*   **Step 1:** They correctly identify that Multiplication comes first ($M$ comes before $A/S$).
    *   *Calculation:* $4 \times 2 = 8$
    *   *Remaining Expression:* $3 - 5 + 8$
*   **Step 2:** They look at their BIDMAS checklist and see "A" for Addition comes before "S" for Subtraction. They isolate the "addition" part of the remaining expression.
    *   *Calculation:* They see $5 + 8$ and calculate $13$.
*   **Step 3:** They take the remaining number (the $3$) and apply the final "Subtraction" operation.
    *   *Calculation:* $3 - 13 = -10$

### 3. Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D (-10)**. 
*(Note: The correct calculation, moving left to right, is $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 8 = 6$, which is Option A).*

### 4. How Natural/Attractive is this Error?
This error is **highly attractive** and one of the most stubborn misconceptions in secondary mathematics.

*   **Reliance on the Mnemonic:** Students are taught BIDMAS as a tool to help them, so they treat the sequence of letters as a "holy law." To a Year 9 student, calculating addition before subtraction feels like following instructions correctly.
*   **Visual Grouping:** In the string $3 - 5 + 8$, the $5 + 8$ sits neatly at the end of the expression. Mentally "clumping" $5$ and $8$ together is a common visual instinct.
*   **Lack of Conflict:** The student will likely **not realise they went wrong**. Because Option D is provided as a multiple-choice answer, it reinforces their confidence ("I did the steps and my answer is there; therefore, I must be right"). They would only realize the error if they were prompted to remember the "left-to-right" rule, which many students forget once they have memorized the BIDMAS acronym itself.
