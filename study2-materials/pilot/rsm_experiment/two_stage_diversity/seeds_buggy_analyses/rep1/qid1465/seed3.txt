In the context of the UK Year 9 curriculum, where students have been taught BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction), a highly specific and common misconception involves the **Strict Alphabetical Hierarchical interpretation of BIDMAS** (specifically the "Addition before Subtraction" bug).

### 1. The specific misconception: "Addition precedes Subtraction" (Rigid BIDMAS)
The student believes that the order of the letters in the acronym BIDMAS (or BODMAS) represents a rigid, fixed hierarchy. Because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym, the student incorrectly assumes that **all** addition operations in an expression must be completed before **any** subtraction operations, regardless of their position from left to right. They are unaware of the "equal priority" rule for Addition and Subtraction.

### 2. Step-by-step procedural error
A student with this misconception would approach the expression $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$ as follows:

*   **Step 1: Multiplication.** They correctly identify that Multiplication comes first. They calculate $4 \times 2 = 8$. The expression becomes: $3 - 5 + 8$.
*   **Step 2: Rigid Addition.** Following the "A before S" rule, they look for the addition sign. They see $-5 + 8$. However, they usually treat the numbers as absolute values first or misinterpret the "middle" addition. They perform: $5 + 8 = 13$.
*   **Step 3: Subtraction.** They are now left with the initial 3 and the result of their addition: $3 - 13$.
*   **Step 4: Calculation.** They calculate $3 - 13 = -10$.

### 3. Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D (–10)**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the error
This is a "high-confidence" error. To a Year 9 student, this feels like they are successfully applying the "rules" they were taught in Year 7.
*   **Why it's attractive:** Acronyms like BIDMAS are often taught as a simple top-to-bottom list. If a teacher hasn't emphasized that Addition and Subtraction are a "package deal" (left-to-right), the student feels they are being more mathematically disciplined by doing addition first.
*   **Self-correction:** The student would almost certainly **not** realize they went wrong. Because $-10$ is an explicit option (and negative numbers are common in Year 9), the presence of the answer confirms their belief that their "BIDMAS method" worked perfectly. They would only realize the error if they checked their work against a calculator that uses standard algebraic logic (DAL).
