As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I will focus on a pervasive error involving the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Strict PEMDAS/BIDMAS Linearity"
The misconception is the belief that the order of the letters in the acronym (Brackets, Indices, **Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction**) must be followed in an absolute, rigid sequence. Specifically, the student believes that **Addition must always be performed before Subtraction** because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym. They fail to understand that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be performed from left to right.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this "Addition over Subtraction" bug would process the expression $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$ as follows:

*   **Step 1:** The student correctly identifies that multiplication comes first ($M$ before $A/S$).
    Calculation: $4 \times 2 = 8$.
    Remaining expression: $3 - 5 + 8$.
*   **Step 2:** The student looks at their acronym (BIDM**AS**). Because $A$ is before $S$, they feel compelled to perform the addition ($5 + 8$) before the subtraction.
    Calculation: $5 + 8 = 13$.
*   **Step 3:** The student brings down the remaining part of the expression.
    Calculation: $3 - 13$.
*   **Final Step:** $3 - 13 = -10$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Answer D: $-10$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is an exceptionally "sticky" and attractive error for Year 9 students for several reasons:

*   **Reliance on Mnemonics:** Many students use BIDMAS as a "safety blanket" rather than understanding the underlying mathematical structure. To them, "the rules are the rules"; if 'A' is before 'S' in the song or acronym they learned, they follow it religiously.
*   **Aversion to Negative Numbers:** In the expression $3 - 5 + 8$, calculating $3 - 5$ first yields $-2$. Many students find starting a calculation with a negative result unintuitive or "messy." By jumping to $5 + 8$, they deal with positive integers for longer, which feels "more correct" to a struggling learner.
*   **Illusion of Order:** Following the letters alphabetically provides a clear, unambiguous path through the problem. When a student sees $-10$ as a multiple-choice option, it serves as a "confirmation bias" anchor—they assume they must have applied the rules correctly because their result is "on the board." They would be unlikely to realize they went wrong until the concept of "equal priority" is explicitly demonstrated using a number line or a calculator.
