As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent issue known as **Strict Order of BODMAS Operations (Linear Priority).**

### 1. The specific misconception: Strict Order of Operations
The misconception is the belief that the operations in the acronym BODMAS (or BIDMAS) must be followed in the exact literal sequence of the letters, without recognizing that **Addition and Subtraction carry equal priority**. 

In the UK, students are often taught that 'A' comes before 'S'. A student with this "buggy procedure" believes they *must* perform all addition operations in an expression before they can move on to subtraction, regardless of the left-to-right positioning.

### 2. Step-by-step student workthrough
A student with the **Addition over Subtraction** misconception would approach $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$ as follows:

*   **Step 1 (Multiplication):** They correctly identify that Multiplication comes before Addition and Subtraction. 
    *   Calculation: $4 \times 2 = 8$.
    *   Remaining expression: $3 - 5 + 8$.
*   **Step 2 (The Misconception):** They look at the remaining operations (Subtraction and Addition). Because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym, they believe they must add the 5 and the 8 first. 
    *   *Note:* They often treat the expression as $3 - (5 + 8)$ rather than treating the $5$ as a $-5$.
    *   Calculation: $5 + 8 = 13$.
*   **Step 3 (Subtraction):** They perform the final subtraction.
    *   Calculation: $3 - 13 = -10$.

### 3. Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $-10$**.

(The correct answer is A: 6, found by working left-to-right after the multiplication: $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 8 = 6$).

### 4. Attractiveness of the error
This error is **highly attractive and persistent**. For a Year 9 student, this is often a "hidden" error because:

*   **Literal Interpretation:** Students are taught to "Follow BODMAS," and following the letters in order feels like a rigorous application of the rules. 
*   **Linguistic Priming:** The teacher says "Addition and Subtraction," naming Addition first. 
*   **Lack of Internal Conflict:** The calculation results in a whole number that appears in the multiple-choice list, which provides the student with "confirmation bias." They feel they have applied a sophisticated rule correctly. 
*   **Aversion to Negatives:** Adding $5+8$ is much "cleaner" to a student than the correct method of combining a negative 5 and a positive 8 ($-5+8$). They often bypass the difficulty of negative number arithmetic by defaulting to the strict BODMAS sequence. 

A student would almost certainly **not realise they went wrong**. To them, $-10$ feels like the "mathematical" answer, while $6$ might feel like a "lazy" answer they would have gotten in primary school by just working left-to-right.
