As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent procedural error for this specific question.

### 1. The Misconception: "Linear Processing" (or "Left-to-Right Priority")
The specific bug is the **Left-to-Right Processing error**. In this case, the student ignores the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and treats the mathematical expression like a sentence in English, performing operations strictly in the order they appear from left to right.

They fail to recognize that division holds a higher "priority" than addition unless brackets dictate otherwise.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Logic
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:

**Left-hand side calculation:**
1.  The student sees $8 + 12 \div 4$.
2.  **Step 1:** They perform the first operation they see: $8 + 12 = 20$.
3.  **Step 2:** They take that result and perform the next operation: $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.
4.  *The correct BIDMAS value is actually 11 (doing $12 \div 4$ first).*

**Right-hand side calculation:**
1.  The student sees $(8 + 12) \div 4$.
2.  **Step 1:** Even if they don't know the rule for brackets, the "Left-to-Right" habit still results in $8 + 12 = 20$.
3.  **Step 2:** $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.
4.  *In this specific case, the brackets align with their "Left-to-Right" habit, so they calculate this side "correctly" by accident.*

**The Comparison:**
The student compares their results: $5 \square 5$.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads the student to choose **C) \( = \)**.

Because they ignore the priority of the division on the left side, both expressions appear to collapse into the same calculation $(20 \div 4)$, leading them to conclude the expressions are identical in value.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive and "natural"** for several reasons:

*   **Linguistic Consistency:** In English (and many other languages), we read from left to right. It feels counter-intuitive to a Year 9 student to "jump" to the middle of an expression to start a calculation.
*   **False Confirmation:** When the student calculates the right-hand side, the brackets actually reinforce their "Left-to-Right" habit. Because they get the same intermediate sum ($20$) on both sides, they feel a sense of "mathematical harmony" and confidence.
*   **Lack of Conflict:** The numbers $8+12$ are "friendly" and sum perfectly to a multiple of 4. This "clean" arithmetic acts as a "distractor" that masks the procedural error; the student is so satisfied with getting an integer answer (5) that they don't stop to question their method. 

The student would likely **not realize they went wrong.** They would view the brackets on the right as redundant decorations rather than essential instructions.
