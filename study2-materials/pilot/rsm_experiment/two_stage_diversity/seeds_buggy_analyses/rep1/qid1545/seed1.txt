As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a primary error common among UK Year 9 students (typically 13–14 years old) involving the Order of Operations.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The "Left-to-Right" Linear Processing Bug
This is a specific procedural error where a student ignores the priority of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and instead processes the calculation like a sentence in English: strictly from left to right. They view the mathematical symbols as a simple sequence of commands rather than a hierarchical structure.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Logic
A student with this misconception would calculate each side of the box as follows:

**Left Hand Side (LHS): $8 + 12 \div 4$**
1.  The student looks at the expression and sees $8 + 12$ first.
2.  **Step 1:** They perform $8 + 12 = 20$.
3.  **Step 2:** They take that result and divide by the next number: $20 \div 4 = 5$.
4.  The student concludes the **LHS = 5**.

**Right Hand Side (RHS): $(8 + 12) \div 4$**
1.  The student sees the brackets. Even if they know brackets come first, the flow remains the same.
2.  **Step 1:** They calculate $8 + 12 = 20$.
3.  **Step 2:** They divide by 4: $20 \div 4 = 5$.
4.  The student concludes the **RHS = 5**.

**Comparison:**
The student sees $5 \square 5$.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads the student directly to **Option C ($=$)**.

### 4. Attractiveness and "Nature" of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and often feels "correct" to the student for three specific reasons:

*   **Consistency:** The student arrives at the same answer for both sides. In many students' minds, "consistent results" equal "mathematical proof." Because they got $5$ both times, they feel validated that their method is stable.
*   **The "Invisible Brackets" Illusion:** Many Year 9 students subconsciously believe that if a teacher wanted them to do division first, they would have put brackets around it. To them, the absence of brackets on the left implies "just do it in order."
*   **Cognitive Ease:** Adding 8 and 12 to get a "round" 20 is cognitively satisfying. Following BIDMAS requires more mental effort—performing $12 \div 4$ first results in $8 + 3 = 11$. Compared to the "cleaner" $20 \div 4$, the correct path feels less intuitive to a struggling learner.

The student is **extremely unlikely** to realize they went wrong. Because the question is designed to test the *necessity* of brackets, the incorrect linear method "hides" the difference between the two expressions, making the student feel they have discovered a simple truth: that the brackets "didn't change anything."
