As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a primary error that UK Year 9 students frequently commit when faced with this specific structure.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Linearity Bias" (Left-to-Right Processing)
The specific bug is **Left-to-Right Processing (Ignoring Order of Operations)**. While Year 9 students have been taught BIDMAS/BODMAS, many revert to a "reading" strategy under pressure. They treat the mathematical string as a sentence to be read from left to right, assuming that the physical position of numbers dictates the order of calculation, effectively ignoring operator precedence (Division before Addition).

### 2. The Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would process both sides of the box independently, but apply the "Left-to-Right" rule to the left-hand side:

**Left-Hand Side (The Error):**
1. Look at $8 + 12 \div 4$.
2. Start at the left: Calculate $8 + 12$, which equals $20$.
3. Take the result ($20$) and proceed to the next operation: $20 \div 4$.
4. Calculate $20 \div 4 = 5$.
*Final result for LHS: 5*

**Right-Hand Side (Correct by coincidence):**
1. Look at $(8 + 12) \div 4$.
2. See the brackets and resolve them first (or simply process left-to-right as before): $8 + 12 = 20$.
3. Take $20$ and divide by $4$.
4. Calculate $20 \div 4 = 5$.
*Final result for RHS: 5*

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
Because the student calculated $5$ for the left side and $5$ for the right side, they will select:
**C) $=$**

*(Note: The mathematically correct answer is A, as $11 > 5$.)*

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and often feels "correct" to the student for three reasons:

1.  **Symmetry:** The numbers are identical on both sides ($8, 12, 4$). Many students have a meta-belief that "if the numbers are the same, the answer is likely the same," leading them to search for a reason to justify equality.
2.  **Ease of Calculation:** Calculating $8 + 12 = 20$ then $20 \div 4$ yields "clean" integers at every step. In contrast, performing the correct BIDMAS steps ($12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8 + 3 = 11$) requires the student to temporarily hold the number 8 in their working memory while they jump to the middle of the expression, which is cognitively more taxing.
3.  **Low Self-Correction:** The student is unlikely to realize they are wrong because the calculation $20 \div 4$ is "satisfying." Because they arrived at the same number (5) for both sides, they feel they have found a pattern or confirmed a "trick," providing a false sense of validation. They would likely view the brackets on the right as redundant decorations rather than essential instructions.
