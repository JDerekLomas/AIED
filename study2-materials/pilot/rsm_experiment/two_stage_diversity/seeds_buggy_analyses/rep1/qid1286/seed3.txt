As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific procedural error that is common among Year 9 students when rearranging formulas involving fractions and multiplication.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Multiplicative Inversion Error" (or "Flipping the Wrong Side")

The student understands the formula for the volume of a sphere, $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, but struggles with the dual operations of a fraction coefficient. Specifically, when "moving" a fraction to the other side of an equation, they correctly identify that a reciprocal or division is needed, but they apply it incorrectly to the existing variables.

### 2. The Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would typically follow these steps:

1.  **State the Formula:** $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.
2.  **Isolate the $r$ term:** They recognize they need to move the $\frac{4}{3}$ and the $\pi$.
3.  **The Procedural "Bug":** When trying to move the $\frac{4}{3}$ and $\pi$ simultaneously, the student thinks, *"I need to multiply the $V$ side by the coefficient."* However, they mistakenly believe the entire coefficient of $r^3$ (which is $\frac{4\pi}{3}$) should be flipped as a whole unit, but they fail to properly group the $\pi$ in the denominator during the move. 
    *   Instead, they might treat the $\frac{4}{3}$ and $\pi$ as separate "top-heavy" entities. They might multiply $V$ by $\frac{4}{3}$ and multiply by $\pi$ rather than dividing by it. 
    *   In the most common variation of this bug, the student looks at $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ and thinks: *"To get rid of the $3$ on the bottom, I put a $3$ on the top; to get rid of the $4$ and $\pi$, I keep them together."*
    *   They rearrange to: $r^3 = \frac{4V\pi}{3}$ because they intuitively associate "volume" with the "top" of the sphere formula, keeping the $4\pi$ together with the $V$ and leaving the $3$ in the denominator.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option A**: $\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm}$.

### 4. How Natural/Attractive is this Error?
This error is **highly attractive** and often feels "correct" to a Year 9 student for several reasons:

*   **Visual Familiarity:** The term $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ is very "sticky" in the student's memory. In Option A, that cluster ($4\pi$ over $3$) remains intact. Subconsciously, the student prefers an answer that "looks" like the original formula they memorized.
*   **The "Multiplying vs. Dividing" Confusion:** Students often think rearranging is simply moving parts to the other side of the equals sign without correctly performing the inverse operation. If $\pi$ is on the "top" (numerator level) on the right, they may mistakenly leave it on the "top" on the left because "that's where $\pi$ belongs" in the sphere formula.
*   **Lack of Dimensional Analysis:** A student at this level rarely checks if the units work. They won't realize that in Option A, as $V$ (which is $r^3$) increases, the result $r$ increases, but the constant $\pi$ being in the numerator rather than the denominator makes the sphere mathematically impossible.

The student would likely **not realize they went wrong**. They would see all the correct components ($V, 4, \pi, 3$, and the cube root) present in Option A and assume they have successfully rearranged the equation.
