In the context of UK Year 9 algebra, the specific error identified in the prompt is a classic example of a "reverse operation" error related to the isolation of variables.

### 1. The specific misconception: The "Additive Compensation" Bug
The student possesses a specific procedural bug where they understand the concept of **"balancing an equation"** (performing an action on both sides), but they fail to correctly identify the **inverse operation**. 

In Step 2, the student sees a $+1$ and instinctively knows they need to "do something with the number 1" to get $k$ on its own. Instead of performing the inverse operation (subtraction), they move the number across the equals sign and "compensate" by adding it to the other side, essentially treating the equals sign as a portal where numbers are simply grouped together regardless of their operator.

### 2. How the student works through the question:
*   **Step 1:** The student looks at the $\div 4$ and correctly identifies that the inverse is $\times 4$. They multiply $15$ by $4$ to get $60$. They write: $60 = 1 + k$. (Correct)
*   **Step 2:** The student identifies that the goal is to isolate $k$. They see the $+1$. Instead of thinking "I must subtract 1 from both sides," their internal rule is: *"Take the number 1 and combine it with the 60."* Because $k$ is being "added to," they feel that $k$ must be a larger value, or they simply forget to switch the sign. They calculate $60 + 1 = 61$. 
*   **Conclusion:** They arrive at $61 = k$ and conclude that both steps they performed were logical and followed the "rules" of moving numbers around.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to:
This misconception leads the student to select **Option C: Both steps are correct.** 

Because Step 1 is mathematically sound and the student’s internal "buggy" logic justifies Step 2, they will see no error in the working provided.

### 4. How natural/attractive this error is:
This is an **extremely high-frequency error** for Year 9 students. 
*   **The "Plus" Bias:** Students often see a plus sign and instinctively want to add, especially if the numbers are small and "easy." 
*   **Cognitive Load:** By the time a student has successfully cleared the fraction in Step 1, they often experience "finish line" syndrome. They relax their focus and revert to more primitive arithmetic habits for the final step.
*   **Lack of Verification:** The student is very unlikely to realize they went wrong. Because $61$ is close to $60$, and the steps *look* like standard algebraic manipulation, the answer "feels" right. Unless the student is taught to **substitute** the answer back into the original equation ($15 = \frac{1+61}{4}$ which is $15 = 15.5$), they will have total confidence in their incorrect answer.
