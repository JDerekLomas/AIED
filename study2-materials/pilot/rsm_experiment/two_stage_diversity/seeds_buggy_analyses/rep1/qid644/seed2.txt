As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent issue for UK Year 9 students known as **The Operation Confusion Bug (Addition over Multiplication)**.

Here is the breakdown of this misconception:

### 1. The Specific Misconception: Operation Confusion
The student understands that expanding brackets involves "combining" the terms, but they fail to distinguish between the **implicit operation of the expansion** (multiplication) and the **signs of the terms**. Instead of multiplying the two constants, the student performs an arithmetic addition of the two integers. They see $-1$ and $-4$ and treat the expansion process as a request to find their sum rather than their product.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Logic
A student with this misconception would approach the arrows as follows:
*   **Step 1:** Look at the first term indicated: $-1$.
*   **Step 2:** Look at the second term indicated: $-4$.
*   **Step 3:** Instead of multiplying (as required by the distributive law), the student thinks: *"I have minus one and I have minus four. Together, that makes minus five."*
*   **Step 4:** They interpret the task of "combining the terms" as $(-1) + (-4)$.
*   **Step 5:** They conclude the answer is $-5$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: \(-5\)**. 

*(Note: Option C would be the result of a "Sign Flip" error where they added the digits but ignored the negative nature of the integers, while Option B would be the result of "Multiplying the digits but keeping the sign of the larger number").*

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive and often "silent"** to the student. 
*   **Linguistic Confusion:** In English, we often say we are "putting the terms together." To a Year 9 student, "putting $-1$ and $-4$ together" intuitively sounds like addition.
*   **Cognitive Overload:** Expansion requires several steps (FOIL). When a student reaches the final constants, their "multiplication muscle" is tired, and they slip into a more basic arithmetic mode (addition).
*   **Lack of Realisation:** The student is unlikely to realize they are wrong because $-5$ feels like a "correct" interaction between 1 and 4. Unlike an error that results in a wildly different number, $-5$ feels "mathematically related" to the inputs, giving the student a false sense of confidence in their result.
