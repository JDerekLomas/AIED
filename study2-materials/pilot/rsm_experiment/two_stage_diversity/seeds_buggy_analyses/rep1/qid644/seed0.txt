As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, here is an analysis of a common error a Year 9 student (typically aged 13–14) would make on this task.

### 1. The specific misconception: The "Operation Confusion" Bug
The specific error is **Additive Interference** (also known as "Operation Misidentification"). This occurs when a student sees a string of numbers with signs and reverts to **addition/subtraction rules** instead of the required **multiplicative rules**, even though they are consciously aware they are supposed to be "multiplying the brackets."

### 2. Step-by-step student workthrough
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:
1. **Identify the terms:** The student correctly identifies that the arrows are pointing to $-1$ and $-4$.
2. **Retrieve the operation:** They know the overarching goal is to "expand" or "multiply," but their brain focuses on the "combination" of the two integers.
3. **Execute the calculation:** Instead of multiplying $(-1) \times (-4)$, they mentally process them as terms to be "collected" or combined. They think: *"I have minus one and minus four... together that makes minus five."*
4. **Conclusion:** They conclude that "multiplying" these two specific parts results in the total value of the combined parts.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $-5$**. 
*(Note: Option C would be the result of a similar additive error if the student also applied a "double negative makes a positive" rule incorrectly to an addition problem).*

### 4. How natural/attractive this error is
This error is **highly attractive** and one of the most persistent bugs in Key Stage 3 algebra for several reasons:

*   **Linguistic Priming:** When students see $-1$ and $-4$, they often read it internally as "negative one take away four," which triggers the subtraction pathway in the brain rather than the multiplication pathway.
*   **Cognitive Load:** Expanding brackets (FOIL/Grid method) requires managing multiple steps. Under high cognitive load, students often default to the "simpler" operation (addition) for the constants at the end of the expression.
*   **Invisible Operators:** In the expression $(2p - 1)(3p - 4)$, there is no "$\times$" sign visible between the $-1$ and the $-4$. Without a visible multiplication symbol, the brain often defaults to the "collection" logic used when simplifying expressions (e.g., $-1 - 4 = -5$).

The student would likely **not realize they went wrong**. To them, "combining" the numbers feels like a valid way to find what they "get" from those two terms. They would only spot the error if they explicitly checked their work by reciting the rule "a negative times a negative is a positive."
