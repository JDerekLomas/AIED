As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific "bug" that is highly prevalent among UK Year 9 students when moving from linear expressions to expanding quadratics.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Operation Confusion" (Adding instead of Multiplying)

The precise error is the **Addition-for-Multiplication substitution**. This occurs when a student understands that they must "combine" the two terms indicated by the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) arrows, but reverts to the more intuitive operation of addition or subtraction rather than multiplication. This is often triggered by the presence of negative signs, which distract the student from the structural requirement of the bracket expansion.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Working

A student with this misconception would follow these steps:

1.  **Identify the terms:** The student correctly identifies the two numbers indicated by the arrows as $-1$ and $-4$.
2.  **Select the operation:** Instead of recognizing that "expanding brackets" implies multiplication ($(-1) \times (-4)$), the student thinks: *"I have a minus one and a minus four; I need to put them together."*
3.  **Execute the "sum":** The student performs the calculation $-1 - 4$. 
4.  **Reach the result:** They calculate that $1 + 4 = 5$, and since both are negative, the result must be negative. They conclude the answer is $-5$.

### 3. Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $-5$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly natural and "sticky"** for several reasons:

*   **Linguistic Ambiguity:** Teachers often use the phrase "collecting terms" or "combining" when dealing with expressions. A student may misinterpret the arrows as an instruction to "combine" the constants.
*   **Cognitive Load:** When a student sees $-1$ and $-4$, the brain’s immediate "arithmetic reflex" often jumps to addition/subtraction (the number line model) before the algebraic rule (multiplication) can be retrieved from long-term memory.
*   **Self-Correction:** The student would **not realize they went wrong**. To them, $-1$ and $-4$ "making" $-5$ feels mathematically "right" because it follows a consistent (though misplaced) rule of arithmetic. They are unlikely to double-check the operation because they are focused on getting the sign right, rather than questioning if they should be multiplying in the first place. This makes it a "hidden" procedural bug that often persists until the student is specifically prompted to "find the product" rather than "find the answer."
