As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific "buggy procedure" common among students transitioning from arithmetic to algebra.

### 1. The Misconception: The "Operation Overload" Bug (Addition instead of Multiplication)
The specific misconception is **confusing the operation of terms with the operation of coefficients**. 

Students frequently default to the "easier" operation of addition/subtraction when they see two numbers grouped together, especially when the visual representation (the FOIL/claw method arrows) mimics the look of a number line or a standard sum. They focus on the numerical values and the signs but forget that the structure of expanding brackets inherently implies multiplication ($1 \times 1$).

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Thinking
A student with this misconception would work through the problem as follows:
*   **Step 1:** Look at the two terms identified by the arrows: $-1$ and $-4$.
*   **Step 2:** Recognize that the task is to "combine" these two numbers.
*   **Step 3:** Instead of multiplying them, the student applies the rules for **collecting like terms** or standard integer addition.
*   **Step 4:** They calculate: $-1 + (-4)$.
*   **Step 5:** Thinking "one negative further away from zero by four," they arrive at $-5$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $-5$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is an **extremely attractive error** for a Year 9 student, and it is highly unlikely they would realize they have gone wrong. There are three reasons why:

1.  **Linguistic Ambiguity:** In English, we often say "put the -1 and the -4 together." To a novice, "together" suggests addition (totaling), not multiplication.
2.  **Cognitive Load:** Expanding brackets (especially with coefficients like $2p$ and $3p$) is high-effort. When the student reaches the final "constant" terms, they often "downgrade" their thinking to basic arithmetic to save mental energy, reverting to the more familiar process of adding.
3.  **Confirmation Bias:** Because $-5$ is a provided option, it validates their calculation. If the student had arrived at $-5$ and only saw positive numbers in the options, they might rethink; because the distractor is there, it acts as a "trap" that confirms their faulty logic.
