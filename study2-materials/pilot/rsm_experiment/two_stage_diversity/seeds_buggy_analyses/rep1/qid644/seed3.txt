As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent "buggy procedure" that frequently occurs in the UK Year 9 curriculum as students transition from additive arithmetic to multiplicative algebra.

### 1. The Misconception: Operation Mixing (Additive over Multiplicative)
The specific error is **Operation Mixing**. This occurs when a student recognizes the need to "combine" the two numbers identified by the arrows but reverts to **addition/subtraction** instead of **multiplication**. 

Students often hear the phrase "expand the brackets" and subconsciously link it to "grouping" or "putting things together," leading them to apply the rule for collecting like terms (addition) rather than the rule for distributing brackets (multiplication).

### 2. The Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:
1.  **Identify the terms:** The student looks at the arrows and correctly identifies the numbers as $-1$ and $-4$.
2.  **Determine the operation:** Instead of recognizing that expansion requires multiplying every term in the first bracket by every term in the second, the student thinks, "I have a minus one and a minus four; I need to put them together."
3.  **Perform the calculation:** The student calculates $-1 + (-4)$ or $-1 - 4$. 
4.  **Logical deduction:** They think: "I am at $-1$ on the number line and I go down by $4$, which brings me to $-5$."

### 3. The Resulting Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $-5$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and feels "natural" for several reasons:
*   **The "Sign Same, Add" Rule:** Many students are taught mnemonics for directed numbers. A student might remember "If the signs are the same, you add them" but apply it to the digits (1+4) while keeping the sign, rather than applying the rules for multiplication.
*   **Visual Proximity:** Because the $-1$ and $-4$ are constants (just numbers), students often feel more comfortable "adding" them as they would in a standard expression, whereas they would instinctively multiply the $2p$ and $3p$ because the variables "feel" different.
*   **Lack of Self-Correction:** A student is **very unlikely** to realize they have gone wrong. To them, $-5$ feels like a "correct" interaction between $-1$ and $-4$. Unlike a "clumsy" error (like saying $1 \times 4 = 5$), this is a systemic error in logic; they have followed a rule—just the wrong one. They will see $-5$ as a distractor and feel a sense of validation that their answer is "there," leading them to select it with confidence.
