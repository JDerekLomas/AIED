In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), students often juggle competing rules for fractions. While many have mastered adding the "big numbers," a persistent issue remains with the denominators.

### 1. The Misconception: Denominator Summation (Add-All)
The specific misconception is the **"Add-All" bug**, where a student treats the numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers to be summed. The student fails to recognize that the denominator represents the *size* or *type* of the parts (the unit) rather than a quantity to be combined.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with the **Denominator Summation** bug would approach the problem like this:

1.  **Add the integers:** They see the 2 and the 1 and add them correctly: $2 + 1 = 3$.
2.  **Add the numerators:** They look at the top numbers of the fractions and add them: $1 + 2 = 3$.
3.  **Add the denominators:** Instead of keeping the common denominator (fifths), they apply the same logic used for the numerators: $5 + 5 = 10$.
4.  **Combine:** They put these three results together to form the mixed number $3 \frac{3}{10}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $3 \frac{3}{10}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly natural and "sticky"** because it follows a pattern of false consistency. In almost every other operation a Year 9 student performs—multiplication of fractions, addition of whole numbers, and addition of decimals—they are taught to operate on both parts of the expression. 

The student is unlikely to realize they went wrong because:
*   **Intuitive Logic:** They feel they have addressed every component of the question (integers, numerators, and denominators).
*   **Plausibility:** $3 \frac{3}{10}$ is "close" to $3 \frac{3}{5}$ in appearance, and because the denominators "look" like they are being combined, it feels like progress. 
*   **Lack of Estimation:** Without a visual model (like "slices of pizza"), the student doesn't realize that by doubling the denominator, they have unintentionally halved the size of the fractional parts, making their answer smaller than it should be. Since $3 \frac{3}{10}$ is a valid-looking mixed number, it provides a false sense of security.
