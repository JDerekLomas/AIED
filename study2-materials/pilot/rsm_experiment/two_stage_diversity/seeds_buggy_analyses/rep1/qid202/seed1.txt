In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), students are moving toward fluency with fractions, but foundational errors often persist when working with mixed numbers and different denominators.

### 1. The specific misconception: The "Common Denominator Overgeneralisation" (Specifically, Denominator Summation)

The misconception is that the rules for multiplying numerators (top $\times$ top) apply to adding denominators (bottom $+$ bottom). This is a "procedural bug" where the student treats the denominator not as a label of the size of the parts, but as a standard number to be operated on.

### 2. The Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would typically approach the calculation using the "partitioning" method (dealing with whole numbers and fractions separately):

1.  **Add the whole numbers:** The student identifies $2$ and $1$. They add them together: $2 + 1 = 3$.
2.  **Add the numerators:** They look at the fractional parts, $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{2}{5}$. They add the top numbers: $1 + 2 = 3$.
3.  **Sum the denominators:** Instead of keeping the common denominator ($5$), the student applies the same additive logic to the bottom of the fraction: $5 + 5 = 10$.
4.  **Combine the results:** They put the parts together to get the mixed number $3 \frac{3}{10}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $3 \frac{3}{10}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness and Self-Correction
**How natural/attractive is this error?**
This is a highly seductive error for a Year 9 student. Mathematically, it feels "consistent" and "symmetrical"—if you add the big numbers and add the top numbers, it feels instinctively "fair" to add the bottom numbers as well.

**Would the student realise they went wrong?**
Most likely **not**.
*   **Intuition Gap:** $3 \frac{3}{10}$ is numerically very close to the correct answer $3 \frac{3}{5}$ ($3.3$ vs $3.6$). It "looks" like a reasonable magnitude for the sum.
*   **False Positive:** Unlike subtraction, where this bug often leads to impossible results (like $0$ in the denominator), in addition, it produces a clean-looking fraction.
*   **The Trap of Option B:** A student might look at Option B ($\frac{18}{5}$), recognise it as a correct improper fraction version of the sum, and yet still choose D because the question explicitly asks for a **mixed number**. This instruction actually steers a struggling student away from a correct improper fraction and back into the arms of the $3 \frac{3}{10}$ error.
