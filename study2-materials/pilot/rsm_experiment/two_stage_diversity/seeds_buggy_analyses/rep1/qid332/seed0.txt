As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, here is an analysis of a common error a Year 9 student would make on this task.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Partial Multiplication of an Equation"
The specific procedural error is known as **Incomplete Distribution across an Equation**. This occurs when a student understands the inverse relationship (multiplication undoes division) but fails to treat the side of the equation as a single expression. They believe they can "cancel out" a denominator by multiplying just one term on the Left Hand Side (LHS) while ignoring the constant term ($5$), while correctly remembering to multiply the Right Hand Side ($12$).

### 2. The Student’s Step-by-Step Reasoning
A student holding this misconception would look at Katie’s suggestion and validate it using the following internal logic:

*   **Step 1:** "I want to get $x$ by itself. There is a $3$ at the bottom of the fraction, so I must multiply by $3$ to get rid of it."
*   **Step 2:** They apply the multiplication to the $\frac{x}{3}$ term: $3 \times \frac{x}{3} = x$.
*   **Step 3:** They see the $-5$ as an independent term. Crucially, they do not perceive the equation as $( \frac{x}{3} - 5 ) \times 3$, but rather as individual "units." They leave the $-5$ exactly as it is.
*   **Step 4:** They know they must keep the equation balanced, so they multiply the RHS by $3$: $12 \times 3 = 36$.
*   **Step 5:** They combine these to reach the line $x - 5 = 36$, concluding that Katie is correct.
*   **Step 6:** They check Tom's work ($12 + 5 = 17$) and agree that adding 5 to both sides is a valid "next step."

### 3. Which Answer Option this Misconception leads to
This misconception leads the student to **Option C: Both Tom and Katie**.

The student recognizes Tom is correct (standard "balancing" by adding 5 first) but wrongly believes Katie’s method of "clearing the fraction" is a mathematically equivalent starting point.

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This error is **highly attractive and "sticky."**

*   **Illusion of Fluency:** Students are often taught to "clear the denominator" as a priority. Katie's line *looks* simpler than the original, which gives the student a false sense of progress.
*   **Lack of Bracket Awareness:** Year 9 students often lack the "structural sense" to realize that multiplying the side of an equation by $3$ is a distributive property act. To them, the $-5$ is "not part of the fraction," so they feel it shouldn't be affected by the 3.
*   **No Red Flags:** The numbers in Katie’s line ($36$ and $5$) are integers and seem "clean." The student will likely solve Katie's equation to get $x=41$ and Tom's to get $x=51$. Without substituting both back into the original equation, there is nothing in the process that alerts them to a contradiction. Because both procedures *felt* logical, they assume there might just be two different ways to arrive at an answer (even if those answers differ).
