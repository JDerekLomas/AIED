As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, here is the identification and analysis of the "buggy procedure" present in this question.

### 1. The Misconception: Partial Term Multiplication (The "Distributive Neglect" Bug)
The specific misconception here is **Selective Application of Inverse Operations**. When a student sees a denominator, they know they must multiply by that value to "clear" the fraction. However, they erroneously believe that the multiplication only applies to the term containing the fraction, rather than every term on both sides of the equation. They fail to treat the left-hand side as a single expression to be multiplied by 3.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure of the Misconception
A student holding this misconception would follow these steps:
*   **Step 1:** Look at the equation $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$.
*   **Step 2:** Decide to "undo" the $\div 3$ by multiplying.
*   **Step 3:** Apply the multiplication only to the fraction and the answer on the right, skipping the constant term (the $-5$).
*   **Step 4:** They calculate $\frac{x}{3} \times 3 = x$ and $12 \times 3 = 36$.
*   **Step 5:** They bring down the $-5$ unchanged, resulting in the line: **$x - 5 = 36$**.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option C (Both Tom and Katie)**.

The student will recognize that Tom’s step (adding 5 to both sides first) is correct, as it is the "standard" way they were taught. However, because they believe Katie’s "clearing the fraction first" step is also valid—unaware that Katie missed multiplying the $-5$ by 3—they will conclude that both methods are viable paths to the solution.

### 4. Attractiveness and Nature of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and extremely common among Year 9 students for several reasons:

*   **Visual Proximity:** The 3 is physically under the $x$. The student’s "mathematical eye" focuses on the local relationship between $x$ and $3$, making the $-5$ feel like an isolated, "unattached" part of the equation that doesn't need to be involved in that specific operation.
*   **Overgeneralization of Inverse Operations:** Students are taught that to "get rid" of a 3, you multiply by 3. They perform this as a "cancellation" rather than a balanced transformation of the entire side of the equation.
*   **False "Confirmation":** The student would likely not realize they are wrong because they will still reach an integer answer ($x = 41$) if they continue. Since the math feels "clean," there are no red flags (like a recurring decimal) to trigger a review of their logic. They see Katie's step as a clever "shortcut" rather than a fundamental breach of equality.
