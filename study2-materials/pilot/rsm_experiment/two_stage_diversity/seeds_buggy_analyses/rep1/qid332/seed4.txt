As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific procedural error frequently observed in UK Key Stage 3 students.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The "Incomplete Distribution" Bug
The misconception is specifically **failing to distribute a multiplication across all terms in an equation.** 

When students attempt to "undo" a division (in this case, the denominator of 3), they correctly identify the inverse operation (multiplication) but incorrectly believe they only need to multiply the fraction and the value on the other side of the equals sign. They forget that for the equality to be maintained, **every** term on both sides of the equation must be multiplied by 3.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Working
A student with this misconception would look at the equation $\frac{x}{3}-5=12$ and decide to eliminate the fraction first. Their thought process would be:
*   **Step 1:** "I want to get $x$ by itself. There is a $\div 3$ under the $x$, so I will multiply by 3 to cancel it out."
*   **Step 2:** They multiply $\frac{x}{3}$ by $3$ to get $x$.
*   **Step 3:** They multiply $12$ by $3$ to get $36$.
*   **Step 4 (The Error):** They simply bring the $-5$ down without multiplying it, because "it doesn't have a 3 under it."
*   **Resulting Line:** $x - 5 = 36$

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads the student to conclude that Katie’s line of working is valid. Since they likely also recognize that Tom’s method (adding 5 to both sides first) is a standard and correct move, they will choose:
**C) Both Tom and Katie**

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly natural and extremely attractive** to Year 9 students for several reasons:

*   **Visual Prioritization:** Students often view an equation as a collection of separate "blocks." The $\frac{x}{3}$ block looks like it needs the 3, and the 12 is the target on the other side. The $-5$ feels "unconnected" to the division, so the student mentally bypasses it.
*   **Pseudo-Productive:** Because the student is correctly using an inverse operation ($\times 3$), they feel they are doing "real algebra."
*   **Lack of Internal Conflict:** The student will not realize they are wrong. In their mind, they have "cleared the fraction," which is a goal their teachers often emphasize. They will proceed to solve for $x$ (getting $x=41$) and, unless they are prompted to check their answer by substituting it back into the original equation ($41/3 - 5 \neq 12$), they will remain entirely confident in Katie's incorrect logic.
