As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a primary error that UK Year 9 students (ages 13–14) frequently encounter when transitioning from arithmetic notation to algebraic notation.

### 1. The Misconception: Order of Operations Dismissal (or "Top-to-Bottom" Reading Bug)
The specific bug is the **misinterpretation of the grouping symbol (brackets) in fractional notation.** In the student’s mind, the division symbol $(\div)$ is simply replaced by a fraction bar without understanding that the horizontal bar acts as a **vinculum** (a grouping symbol). This leads to a failure to maintain the priority of the addition within the divisor.

### 2. Step-by-Step Walkthrough
A student with this misconception would likely process the question as follows:
1. **The Translation Phase:** The student recognizes that in algebra, $c \div \text{something}$ means "$c$ over something." They correctly place $c$ as the numerator.
2. **The Decomposition Phase:** The student looks at $(h+4)$. They see the addition as a separate, secondary operation.
3. **The Layout Phase:** Instead of seeing $(h+4)$ as a single protected block (the denominator), they view the calculation as "$c$ divided by $h$," with $+4$ simply trailing at the end of the expression.
4. **Final Assembly:** They write $\frac{c}{h}$, and then simply "tack on" the $+4$ at the end of the term, failing to extend the fraction bar under the 4.

### 3. Corresponding Answer
This misconception leads the student directly to **Option C: $\frac{c}{h}+4$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is an **extremely natural and highly attractive error** for several reasons:

*   **Left-to-Right Processing:** Students are taught from a young age to read and calculate from left to right. Option C follows the exact visual flow of the original horizontal prompt: $c$ (top left), $h$ (bottom left), $+4$ (far right).
*   **The "Invisible Bracket" Problem:** In algebra, we remove brackets when writing fractions because the vinculum performs that job. A Year 9 student often feels uncomfortable "losing" the brackets and feels that if they don't explicitly see brackets or a clear "blocking" of the terms, the addition is a separate entity.
*   **False Sense of Success:** The student will likely **not realize they have made an error.** Because Option C "contains all the correct characters in the correct order," it feels intuitively correct. To a student struggling with the nuances of algebraic syntax, Option C looks like a direct, literal translation, whereas Option A (the correct answer) requires the conceptual leap of understanding that a line under a sum replaces the need for parentheses.
