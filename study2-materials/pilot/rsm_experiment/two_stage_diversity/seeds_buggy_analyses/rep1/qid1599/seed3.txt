As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a primary error for this specific question involving **Priority of Operations over Fractional Notation (specifically involving hidden grouping).**

### 1. The specific misconception: The "Left-to-Right Translation" Bug
This error occurs when a student translates horizontal division symbols ($\div$) into vertical fraction bars without recognizing that the fraction bar acts as a **grouping symbol** (vinculum). The student ignores the implied brackets in the divisor $(h+4)$ and assumes the division only applies to the term immediately following the operator.

### 2. Step-by-step student workthrough
A student with this misconception would approach the expression $c \div (h+4)$ as follows:

1.  **Scanning for familiar structures:** The student identifies the $c \div$ at the start.
2.  **Fragmenting the expression:** Instead of seeing $(h+4)$ as a single "chunk" or package, they view the calculation as a linear sequence of events: first, "divide $c$ by $h$," then "add 4."
3.  **Applying fractional notation:** They convert $c \div h$ into the algebraic convention $\frac{c}{h}$.
4.  **Tacking on the remainder:** They see the $+4$ as a separate addition step outside of the division operation.
5.  **Conclusion:** They combine these to get $\frac{c}{h} + 4$.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads the student directly to **Option C: $\frac{c}{h} + 4$**.

### 4. How "natural" or attractive is this error?
This error is **highly attractive** and pervasive in Year 9 for several reasons:

*   **Linguistic Mapping:** When we read left-to-right, we encounter the "$c$", the "$\div$", and the "$h$" before we ever reach the "$+ 4$". Students often map algebra directly to the "grammar" of the sentence.
*   **The "De-bracketing" Illusion:** Many students have been conditioned to believe that "removing brackets" is the ultimate goal in algebra (usually via expansion). They see the parentheses in $c \div (h+4)$ and feel they must "resolve" them by essentially ignoring them, leading them to believe $\frac{c}{h} + 4$ is just the "simplified" version.
*   **False Confidence:** The student would likely feel **very confident** in this choice. They would see Option A as "messy" (putting the whole expression under the line) and Option C as more "refined" and "broken down." They would not realize they have fundamentally changed the order of operations until they tried to substitute numbers (e.g., if $c=10, h=1$, the original is $2$, but their answer is $14$). Since students rarely check via substitution, the error remains invisible to them.
