As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent "bug" that affects many Year 9 students when variables appear in the denominator of a fraction.

### 1. The Misconception: "Variable Independence" (Operation Commutativity Error)
The specific misconception is the belief that **the position of the variable in a division does not change the operation required to isolate it.** Students treat $\frac{5}{p}$ as if it were functionally identical to $\frac{p}{5}$. 

This is often a result of over-generalizing the rule "to undo division, you must multiply." Because they see a division bar and a 5, they instinctively feel they must multiply the 10 by the 5, regardless of whether 5 is the dividend or the divisor.

### 2. The Step-by-Step Error
A student with this misconception would process the equation as follows:
1. **Goal Identification:** "I need to get $p$ on its own. I see a fraction involving $p$ and $5$."
2. **Surface Pattern Matching:** The student ignores the structure $(\text{total} = \text{part} / \text{unknown})$ and instead looks at the numbers. They see $10$, $5$, and a division sign.
3. **The "Inverse" Bug:** They think, "To move the $5$ and leave the $p$ behind, I must do the opposite of dividing."
4. **The Calculation:** They multiply the 10 by the 5:
   $$p = 10 \times 5$$
   $$p = 50$$

### 3. Resulting Answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option B ($p = 50$)**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and rarely triggers an internal "alarm" for a Year 9 student for three reasons:

*   **Fluency Illusion:** The calculation ($10 \times 5 = 50$) is cognitively "easy" and yields a clean, whole number. Students are often conditioned to believe that if the math feels smooth and results in an integer, it is likely correct.
*   **The "Isolate the Letter" Mantra:** Students are taught that to solve for $p$, they must "get rid of the other number." Multiplying by 5 is the most direct way to make that 5 "disappear" from the right-hand side in their mental model.
*   **Lack of Estimation:** Most students at this level do not perform a "common sense" check. If they did, they would realize that $\frac{5}{50}$ is $0.1$, not $10$. However, without that final check, the procedural bug (multiplying across the equals sign) feels entirely natural.
