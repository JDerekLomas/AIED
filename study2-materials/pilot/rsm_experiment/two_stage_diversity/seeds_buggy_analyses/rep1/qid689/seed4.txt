As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a primary error often encountered at the Key Stage 3 level (UK Year 9) when dealing with equations where the unknown is in the denominator.

### 1. The specific misconception: The "Division is Commutative" Bug
The most precise description of this error is the **Commutative Misconception of Division**. Students frequently (and often subconsciously) treat division like addition or multiplication, believing that the order of the numbers does not matter. This is compounded by the **"Greater Number Divided by Smaller Number"** heuristic, where students automatically divide the larger visible integer by the smaller one, regardless of their algebraic position.

### 2. Step-by-step student reasoning
A student with this misconception would look at the equation \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\) and perform the following mental or written steps:

1.  **Isolate the variable:** The student recognizes that they need to "do something" with the 10 and the 5 to find \(p\).
2.  **Operator Selection:** They see the division bar (fraction) and know the operation required is division.
3.  **Application of Bug:** Instead of performing the algebraic step of multiplying both sides by \(p\) (obtaining \(10p = 5\)), the student looks at the two integers (10 and 5). 
4.  **Heuristic processing:** Their brain defaults to "What is 10 divided by 5?" because \(10 \div 5\) yields a "cleaner" integer than \(5 \div 10\).
5.  **Calculation:** They calculate \(10 \div 5 = 2\).
6.  **Conclusion:** They conclude that \(p = 2\).

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads directly to **Option C (\(p = 2\))**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the error
This is an **exceptionally attractive and "natural" error** for a Year 9 student for several reasons:

*   **The "Whole Number Bias":** Students are psychologically more comfortable with integer results. \(p = 2\) feels "more correct" than a decimal result like \(0.5\).
*   **The Inverse Operation Trap:** A student might vaguely remember that "to move the 5, you do the opposite," and since they see the 5 "above" the division line, they simply divide the 10 by it. 
*   **Lack of Verification:** The student is unlikely to realize they are wrong. If they "check" their work, they often substitute the number back in and repeat the same mental error: they look at \( \frac{5}{2} \) and—guided by the same misconception—think "10 divided by 5 is 2, so 5 divided by 2 is... well, it must be 10 if you're working backwards." 
*   **Surface Similarity:** Because \(10 \div 5\) and \(5 \div 10\) involve the same digits, students frequently fail to perceive them as fundamentally different operations in the heat of a timed assessment.
