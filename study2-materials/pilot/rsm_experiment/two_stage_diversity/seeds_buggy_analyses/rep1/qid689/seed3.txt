As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent issue for UK Year 9 students known as the **Commutative Property of Division** (or "Big-Divided-by-Small") bug.

### 1. The Misconception: The "Division is Commutative" Bug
This error occurs because students often mistakenly believe that the order of numbers in a division operation does not matter, similar to how it works in addition ($5+10 = 10+5$) or multiplication. More specifically, when students encounter a fraction where the variable is the denominator, they suffer from **Cognitive Conflict**: they find it "unnatural" to divide a smaller number by a larger one ($5 \div 10$), so they instinctively reverse the operation to make it "easy" ($10 \div 5$).

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:
1. **Observation:** Look at the equation $10 = \frac{5}{p}$ and identify that they need to "undo" the fraction to isolate $p$.
2. **Mental Rearrangement:** Instead of performing the algebraic step of multiplying both sides by $p$ (which feels abstract), the student looks for the relationship between 10, 5, and $p$.
3. **The "Easy" Division:** The student thinks: *"To find p, I need to divide. I have a 10 and a 5. I cannot do $5 \div 10$ because that gives a decimal, and math questions 'usually' result in whole numbers."*
4. **The Calculation:** They consciously or subconsciously swap the terms to perform $10 \div 5 = 2$.
5. **Final Statement:** They conclude that $p = 2$.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option C: $p=2$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive and "quietly" dangerous**. 

*   **No Red Flags:** The resulting answer (2) is a clean, whole number. In many UK classrooms, students are conditioned to expect "neat" answers; therefore, $p=2$ feels far more "correct" to a Year 9 student than the actual answer of $0.5$, which might feel "too small" or like a mistake.
*   **Intuition Over Logic:** The student believes they have successfully used a "division fact family" ($5, 10, 2$). Because they see all three numbers as being related in a triangle, they don't feel the need to check their work.
*   **Lack of Verification:** If the student were to substitute $2$ back into the original equation ($10 = 5 \div 2$), they would see $10 \neq 2.5$. However, students who rely on this heuristic rarely perform the "check" step because their confidence in the basic division fact ($10 \div 5 = 2$) is so high.
