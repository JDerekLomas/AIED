In this context, the student is performing a binomial expansion (often taught via the "FOIL" method or grid method). A common stumbling block for UK Year 9 students involves the interaction of directed numbers.

### 1. The specific misconception or procedural error
The specific error is **"Sign Negation Error in the Constant Term"** (also known as a failure of the "negative $\times$ negative = positive" rule). 

While students at this level generally remember to combine the middle terms ($-5m$ and $-7m$), they often struggle with the multiplication of two negative constants. They either believe that because both numbers are being "subtracted," the final product must remain "subtracted" (negative), or they confuse the rules for *adding* negatives with the rules for *multiplying* them.

### 2. How a student with this misconception would work through the question
The student would likely follow a standard distributive process:
1.  **First:** $m \times m = m^2$ (Correct).
2.  **Outer/Inner:** They calculate $-7m$ and $-5m$. They correctly combine these to get $-12m$ (recognising that moving "down" from $-7$ by another $5$ reaches $-12$).
3.  **Last:** They calculate $5 \times 7 = 35$. However, they look at the minus signs in the original expression $(m - 5)$ and $(m - 7)$ and instinctively place a minus sign before the $35$, thinking that "a minus and a minus stay a minus." 
4.  **Assembly:** They combine the terms to get $m^2 - 12m - 35$.

### 3. Which answer option this misconception leads to
This leads directly to **Option D**.

### 4. How natural/attractive this error is
This is a highly "attractive" error because it feels logically consistent to a student struggling with directed numbers. 

*   **Fluency vs. Concept:** The student has mastered the *procedure* of expansion (they know they need four terms or a grid), which gives them a false sense of confidence. 
*   **Visual Pattern Matching:** Because the problem is full of minus signs, an answer containing only minus signs (like Option D) "looks" more correct than one that introduces a plus sign (like Option B).
*   **Likelihood of realization:** The student is very unlikely to realize they went wrong. To them, they have followed every step of FOIL correctly. Without "plugging in" a value for $m$ to check (a step Year 9 students rarely take), the sign error is invisible because the arithmetic ($5 \times 7 = 35$) is correct; it is only the abstract property of the signs that is misapplied.
