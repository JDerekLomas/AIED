In the context of UK Year 9 algebra, the expansion of quadratic brackets often reveals fundamental issues with integer arithmetic and algebraic rules.

### 1. The specific misconception: The Negative-Negative Product Error (Multiplication Bug)
The specific bug is the **"Inconsistent Signed Integer Rule."** This occurs when a student correctly applies the addition rule for two negative numbers (identifying the middle term) but fails to apply the multiplication rule for two negative numbers (identifying the constant term).

Specifically, the student believes that because they are "working with negatives," the final number must remain negative, overriding the "minus times a minus equals a plus" rule.

### 2. Step-by-step walkthrough
A student with this misconception would typically use the FOIL method or a grid:

*   **Firsts:** $m \times m = m^2$. (Correct)
*   **Outers & Inners:** The student calculates $-7m - 5m$. They correctly identify that "negative 7 take away another 5" results in $-12m$. (Correct)
*   **Lasts:** The student calculates $-5 \times -7$. They know the absolute value is $35$. However, they think: *"The whole problem is about negatives, so it must stay negative,"* or they simply forget the sign-flip rule during the final step. They conclude $-5 \times -7 = -35$.
*   **Assembly:** They combine the terms into $m^2 - 12m - 35$.

### 3. Answer option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $m^2 - 12m - 35$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the error
This error is **highly natural and "sticky."**

*   **Cognitive Load:** Expanding brackets requires several mental steps. Often, by the time a student reaches the fourth multiplication, their working memory is taxed, and they revert to a "dominant" feeling that the expression should be negative because the original brackets contained negatives.
*   **Visual Consistency:** Looking at $(m-5)(m-7)$, there are two minus signs visible. A student often feels that the resulting quadratic should "match" the appearance of the input. They see a $(-)$ and a $(-)$, and they expect the final constant to look like a minus.
*   **Lack of Verification:** Without substituting a number (like $m=0$) to check the result, the student has no "alarm" to tell them they are wrong. Because the $-12m$ part is correct, they gain a false sense of confidence that their process is working, making them unlikely to double-check the sign of the constant term.
