As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific error common among students at the Key Stage 3 level (Year 9) regarding the interaction between algebraic operations and sign rules.

### 1. The Misconception: "The Sign-Change Overgeneralisation"
The specific bug is the **"Additive Inverse Overgeneralisation"** (also known as the "Change-the-Sign" bug). 

In this error, the student correctly identifies that they need to "invert" the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$ to $ \frac{4}{3}$ to reach the value of 1. however, they mistakenly apply the rule for **additive inverses** (where you change the sign) to a problem requiring a **multiplicative inverse** (where the product must be positive). They believe that to "undo" or move a negative number across an equals sign (or to cancel it out), the sign *must* change, regardless of the operation.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:

*   **Step 1 (The Magnitude):** The student looks at $\frac{3}{4} \times \star = 1$ (ignoring signs momentarily). They know that to get 1, they need the reciprocal. They correctly calculate $\frac{4}{3}$.
*   **Step 2 (The Sign Rule):** The student looks at the negative sign in $-\frac{3}{4}$. They recall a "rule" from solving linear equations (like $x - 5 = 10 \rightarrow x = 10 + 5$) where moving a number or cancelling a number involves a sign flip.
*   **Step 3 (The Logical Error):** They think: "Since the first number is negative, the second number must be positive to cancel it out," or "To get rid of a minus, I need a plus."
*   **Step 4 (Final Synthesis):** They combine the reciprocal ($\frac{4}{3}$) with their perceived need for a positive sign to "cancel" the negative.

### 3. Which Answer it Leads To
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: $\frac{4}{3}$**.

### 4. How Natural/Attractive is this Error?
This is a **highly attractive "procedural" error** for a Year 9 student. 

The student is unlikely to realize they are wrong for two reasons:
1.  **Over-learned Rules:** They have spent a significant amount of time learning that "negative becomes positive" when moving terms in addition/subtraction. This creates a strong "cognitive interference" where they apply addition logic to a multiplication problem.
2.  **Visual "Balance":** Visually, having one minus sign on the left and one minus sign on the right (the result is $-1$) looks "balanced" to a student. They may think: "If I use another negative (Option B), there will be two negatives on the left, and those make a plus, but my answer needs to be a minus." 

The student fails to realize that $(-) \times (+) = (-)$. They focus on the idea that they are "doing the opposite" to find the star, and to many students, the opposite of negative is simply positive.
