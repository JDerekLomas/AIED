As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a primary error that Year 9 students often encounter when moving from simple arithmetic to reciprocal properties and negative integers.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Reciprocal Negation Overload"
The specific bug is the **Confusion between the Reciprocal and the Additive Inverse**.

Students at this level often learn the rule for dividing by fractions ("Flip the fraction") and the rule for negative numbers ("Two negatives make a positive") around the same time. The "Reciprocal Negation Overload" occurs when a student knows they need to "flip" the fraction to reach the identity, but they mistakenly believe that "doing the opposite" also requires changing the sign from negative to positive. They conflate the **multiplicative inverse** ($x \cdot \frac{1}{x} = 1$) with the **additive inverse** ($x + (-x) = 0$).

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Logic
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:
1. **Identify the goal:** "I need to multiply $-3/4$ by something to get $-1$."
2. **Apply the "Flip" rule:** "To turn a fraction into its 'whole' version, I need to flip it. So, $3/4$ becomes $4/3$."
3. **Misapply the Sign Rule:** "I see a minus sign in the question and a minus sign in the answer. To 'get rid' of the fraction, I must perform the 'opposite' action. The opposite of negative is positive."
4. **Conclusion:** "Therefore, the answer must be the positive version of the flipped fraction: $+4/3$."
5. **Faulty Verification:** The student may think: $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1$. In their head, they see the 3s and 4s cancelling out and assume the remaining negative sign from the first fraction correctly carries over to the result.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: $\frac{4}{3}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and often feels more "correct" to a Year 9 student than the actual answer (Option B). 

**Why they wouldn't realize they are wrong:**
*   **Aesthetics:** $\frac{4}{3}$ looks like the perfect "opposite" to $\frac{3}{4}$. Students are conditioned to look for symmetry in algebra.
*   **Over-reliance on "Two Negatives make a Positive":** Students are often so terrified of the "Double Negative" rule that they instinctively try to avoid having two negative signs in a multiplication unless they *want* a positive answer. Since the target is $-1$ (negative), their intuition tells them: "One number must be negative and one must be positive."
*   **Verification Bias:** When they mentally check their work, they see $-\frac{12}{12} = -1$. Because the arithmetic works, they don't stop to realize they've treated the multiplication correctly but applied a logic of "sign-flipping" that is inconsistent with the rules of reciprocal identity (where the sign must remain the same to maintain the target sign).
