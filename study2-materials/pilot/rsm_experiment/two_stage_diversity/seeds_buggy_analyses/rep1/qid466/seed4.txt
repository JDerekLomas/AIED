As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific "buggy procedure" frequently seen in UK Year 9 students (ages 13–14) who are transitioning from basic arithmetic to algebraic manipulation.

### 1. The Misconception: "Sign-Change Reciprocal" (The Negative Inverse Confusion)
The student has conflated the rule for finding a **reciprocal** (flipping the fraction) with the rule for finding an **additive inverse** (changing the sign). 

In many students' minds, "doing the opposite" to a number means doing *everything* opposite. They incorrectly believe that to "cancel out" a negative fraction through multiplication, they must flip the fraction **and** change the sign from negative to positive. This is often triggered by a misremembered rule regarding perpendicular gradients in geometry (where you take the negative reciprocal) or a general confusion that "minus times minus equals plus" must always apply to the final answer.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:
1.  **Identify the goal:** They see they need to find a value that, when multiplied by $-\frac{3}{4}$, results in $-1$.
2.  **Recognize the reciprocal:** They correctly identify that to get a magnitude of $1$, they must "flip" the fraction. They write down $\frac{4}{3}$.
3.  **Apply the "sign flip" logic:** The student looks at the negative sign in front of the $-\frac{3}{4}$. They incorrectly assume that to maintain a negative balance (or because they feel they must perform an "opposite" action), the star must have the opposite sign of the first number.
4.  **Finalize the sign:** They decide that because the first number is negative, the second number must be positive. They arrive at $+\frac{4}{3}$.
5.  **Faulty Verification:** They might say, "A negative times a positive is a negative, so $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3}$ must be $-1$." (While this is mathematically correct in this instance, their **logic** was to change the sign as part of the "inverting" process, which would lead them to fail if the target result was positive $1$).

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: $\frac{4}{3}$**.

*(Note: While Option A is actually the correct mathematical answer, the **misconception** lies in the student arriving there via "flipping the sign" as a standard part of finding a reciprocal. A student with the opposite bug—thinking they must keep the sign the same—would choose B).*

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This error is **extremely attractive** and "sticky." At the Year 9 level, students are heavily conditioned to associate "solving" or "inverting" with doing the opposite. 

The student would **not realize they went wrong** for two reasons:
*   **The "Zero-Pair" Hangover:** In addition (e.g., $-3 + 3 = 0$), the signs *must* be different. Students often carry this "different signs" requirement over into multiplicative identity problems.
*   **Confirmation Bias:** When they multiply their chosen answer ($\frac{4}{3}$) by the original fraction ($-\frac{3}{4}$), it does indeed produce $-1$. This reinforces their buggy procedure: *"To get back to 1, I flip the fraction; to keep it negative, the signs must be different."* 

They would likely feel very confident in Option A, unaware that they are applying a "Negative Reciprocal" rule intended for perpendicular lines, rather than a "Multiplicative Inverse" rule intended for algebraic balance.
