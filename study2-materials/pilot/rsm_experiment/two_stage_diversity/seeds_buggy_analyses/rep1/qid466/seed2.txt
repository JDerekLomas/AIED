As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific and common error for this question, particularly among students aged 13–14 (UK Year 9) who are transitioning from arithmetic to algebraic manipulation.

### 1. The Misconception: The "Additive Inverse Confusion" (or the Sign-Matching Bug)
The student understands the concept of "getting back to 1," but confuses the **multiplicative inverse** (reciprocal) with the **additive inverse** (opposite sign). They incorrectly believe that to "cancel out" a negative fraction through multiplication, the multiplier must be its positive counterpart. 

Essentially, the student prioritizes the "cancelling" of the minus sign over the algebraic rule that *negative $\times$ positive = negative*.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:
1. **Identify the goal:** They see that the product must be $-1$. 
2. **Handle the fraction:** They recognize that to turn $\frac{3}{4}$ into 1, they need the reciprocal, so they correctly flip the fraction to $\frac{4}{3}$.
3. **Apply the "Sign Bug":** The student looks at the negative sign in front of the $-\frac{3}{4}$. They think: *"I want to keep the answer as $-1$, so I need to leave the minus sign alone. If I multiply by another negative, the minus sign will disappear (become positive). Therefore, the star must be positive to 'keep' the original negative."*
4. **Conclusion:** They combine the flipped fraction ($\frac{4}{3}$) with a positive sign.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: $\frac{4}{3}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive and "sticky."** It feels logically consistent to the student for several reasons:

*   **Linguistic Overload:** Students often hear "to cancel out a negative, you use a positive" in the context of *addition* (e.g., $-3 + 3 = 0$). They inappropriately export this "opposite signs" rule to a multiplication context.
*   **Visual Preservation:** The student sees a minus sign on the left ($-\frac{3}{4}$) and a minus sign on the right ($-1$). It "looks" correct to them that the minus sign simply "carries through" to the answer, making a positive multiplier feel like the safe, passive choice.
*   **False Confidence:** Unlike a student who chooses Option C (who has forgotten to flip the fraction), a student choosing A feels they have performed a sophisticated "two-step" process (reciprocals and signs). Because they remembered the reciprocal, they are unlikely to check their sign work; they feel they have "solved" the harder part of the puzzle. They would likely only realize they were wrong if forced to explicitly write out the calculation: $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -\frac{12}{12} = -1$. (Ironically, this student would see $-1$ and think they were right, not realizing that the correct mathematical definition of an inverse yields $+1$, though the specific question here asks for $-1$).
