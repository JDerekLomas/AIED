As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific "buggy procedure" frequently seen in UK Year 9 students (typically ages 13–14) who are transitioning from basic fraction operations to algebraic manipulation.

### 1. The Misconception: "Operation-Inversion Confusion"
The specific bug is **Additive Inverse Substitution.**

This occurs when a student recognizes that the problem requires "inverting" a number to reach a target of 1 or -1, but they confuse the rule for **additive inverses** (changing the sign) with **multiplicative inverses** (reciprocating the fraction). In this specific case, the student believes that to keep the "balance" of the negative signs in the equation, they should use a value with the same absolute value but a different sign, or they simply fail to account for the "double negative" rule during multiplication.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Reasoning
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:

*   **Step 1:** They look at the equation $-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$.
*   **Step 2:** They identify that the result is negative ($-1$).
*   **Step 3:** They remember a rule that "if the answer is negative, one of the numbers in the multiplication must be positive."
*   **Step 4:** They look at the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$ and decide that because the goal is a whole number (1), the digits must be "flipped" to $\frac{4}{3}$ to cancel out.
*   **Step 5 (The Error):** They focus on the fact that the original number was negative and the result is negative. They reason: *"I already have a negative sign on the left. If I multiply by another negative, the answer will turn positive. Therefore, the star must be the positive version to keep the result negative."*
*   **Result:** They select the positive reciprocal.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: $\frac{4}{3}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and often feels "logically sound" to a Year 9 student for two reasons:

1.  **Over-reliance on "Sign Patterns":** Students are often taught "Negative $\times$ Positive $=$ Negative" as a mantra. Because the start of the equation is negative and the end is negative, the "Positive" middle feels like a missing puzzle piece that completes a memorized pattern.
2.  **Reciprocal Competence:** The student actually *knows* they need the reciprocal to get to "1." Because they have successfully performed the difficult part of the task (flipping the fraction), they feel a false sense of confidence. They are so focused on the digits canceling out that they treat the negative sign as a "background setting" rather than an active operator that must follow its own distributive logic.

The student would likely **not realize they went wrong.** If they checked their work, they would see $\frac{3 \times 4}{4 \times 3} = 1$, see the single minus sign, and conclude the answer is $-1$, feeling their logic is robust. They overlook that they are multiplying $(-\frac{3}{4})$ by $(+\frac{4}{3})$, which indeed yields $-1$, and fail to notice that Option B (the actual reciprocal $-4/3$) would result in $+1$. Their error stems from a misunderstanding of what a "multiplicative inverse" truly is—they forget that the inverse of a negative must be negative to return a positive 1.
