Here is the analysis of the mathematical misconception for this question:

### 1. The specific misconception: The "Squared Product" Error (Exponent Distributed Over Coefficient)
The specific bug is the **misapplication of the distributive law to exponents**, where a student multiplies the coefficient by the base *before* applying the power. Instead of following the order of operations (**BIDMAS**), the student incorrectly treats $3x^2$ as if it were written $(3x)^2$.

### 2. Step-by-step student workthrough
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:
1. **Substitution:** Replace $x$ with $0.3$, resulting in the expression $3 \times 0.3^2$.
2. **Order of Operations Error:** Instead of squaring $0.3$ first, the student prioritizes the multiplication (reading the expression left-to-right).
3. **Calculation:** They multiply $3$ by $0.3$ to get $0.9$.
4. **Final Squaring:** They then square their result: $0.9 \times 0.9 = 0.81$.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads directly to **Option A (0.81)**.

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This is a **highly attractive and frequent error** for Year 9 students for several reasons:
*   **Visual Proximity:** In the notation $3x^2$, the $3$ and the $x$ are touching, which psychologically suggests they are "linked" as a single unit before the power is applied.
*   **Linguistic Reading:** Students often read the term as "three-x squared," which can be interpreted aurally as "square the quantity $3x$." 
*   **BIDMAS Confusion:** Many students believe that you work from left to right regardless of the operation type. Because $0.81$ is the first option listed and appears as a "clean" number (a known square of $9$), the student would feel a strong sense of **confirmation bias**. They would likely select Option A with high confidence, never suspecting they had violated the hierarchy of operations.
