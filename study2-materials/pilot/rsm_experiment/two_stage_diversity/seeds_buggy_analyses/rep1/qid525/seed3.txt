In UK Year 9 (ages 13–14), students are expected to move beyond basic algorithms and understand common denominators. However, many students still fall back on "intuitive" but incorrect shortcuts when dealing with fractions.

### 1. The specific misconception: "Adding Across" (Independent Numerator and Denominator Addition)
This specific procedural error is known as **Adders’ Bug** or **Component-wise Addition**. It occurs when a student treats the numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers rather than parts of a single ratio. Instead of finding a common denominator, the student simply applies the addition operator to every visible "layer" of the mixed number separately.

### 2. Step-by-step student logic
A student with this misconception would process the components of the mixed numbers in three isolated stages:

1.  **Add the whole numbers:** The student identifies the whole numbers $2$ and $2$. They calculate $2 + 2 = 4$. This part feels correct and builds their confidence.
2.  **Add the numerators:** The student looks at the top numbers $7$ and $1$. They calculate $7 + 1 = 8$. This becomes the numerator of the fractional part of their answer.
3.  **Add the denominators:** The student looks at the bottom numbers $10$ and $4$. They calculate $10 + 4 = 14$. This becomes the denominator.
4.  **Assembly:** They join these results together to form the mixed number $4 \frac{8}{14}$.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads directly to **Option D ($4 \frac{8}{14}$)**.

### 4. How natural/attractive this error is
This error is extremely **seductive and "natural"** for a student for several reasons:

*   **Consistency with multiplication:** When students learn to multiply fractions, they *are* told to multiply across ($\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}$). The student is over-generalizing this rule to addition.
*   **Cognitive Ease:** Finding a common denominator ($20$) requires multiple steps (finding a LCM, equivalent fractions, then adding). "Adding across" is a one-step process that avoids the "difficult" part of fraction arithmetic.
*   **Illusion of Progress:** Because the student correctly added the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), they feel they have successfully used half of the information in the question. The result "looks" like a mixed number, which matches the format requested in the prompt.

**Would they realise they went wrong?**
Almost certainly not. Without "fraction sense" (realizing that $2 \frac{1}{2} + 2 \frac{1}{4}$ should be almost 5, whereas $4 \frac{8}{14}$ is significantly less than 5), the procedure feels mathematically consistent to them. Because the answer is listed as an option, the student receives "false validation" that their method was correct.
