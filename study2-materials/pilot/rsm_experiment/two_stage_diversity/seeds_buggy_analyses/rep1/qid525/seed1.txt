In UK Year 9 (ages 13–14), students are moving toward fluency with fractions, but many still fall back on "intuitive" arithmetic shortcuts when faced with multi-step problems.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The "Add Everything" Strategy
The specific misconception is **Independent Component Addition (Non-Common Denominators)**.

This is a buggy procedure where the student treats the integer parts, the numerators, and the denominators as three entirely separate addition problems. Instead of finding a common denominator to unify the fractional parts, the student simply adds "straight across."

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Logic
A student with this misconception would approach the calculation $2 \frac{7}{10} + 2 \frac{1}{4}$ as follows:

1.  **Step 1 (Integers):** Look at the whole numbers $2$ and $2$. Add them together: $2 + 2 = 4$.
2.  **Step 2 (Numerators):** Look at the numerators of the fractions, $7$ and $1$. Add them together: $7 + 1 = 8$.
3.  **Step 3 (Denominators):** Look at the denominators, $10$ and $4$. Add them together: $10 + 4 = 14$.
4.  **Step 4 (Combine):** Reassemble the three results into a single mixed number.

The student concludes that the answer is $4 \frac{8}{14}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $4 \frac{8}{14}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness and Self-Correction
**How natural/attractive is this error?**
This is arguably the most "natural" error in all of fraction arithmetic. It is highly attractive because it mimics the rules students have mastered for **multiplication** (where you *do* work horizontally) and **whole number addition** (where you work column by column). 

**Would the student realise they went wrong?**
Highly unlikely. Because $4 \frac{8}{14}$ appears as an explicit option (often called a "distractor" by examiners), the student will feel a strong sense of validation. They have followed a systematic "rule," and their result is sitting right there in the list. To a student with this misconception, the process feels consistent and logical; they are unlikely to check their answer because, intuitively, adding $10$ and $4$ to get $14$ feels much simpler and more "correct" than the cognitively demanding process of finding a lowest common multiple (20) and calculating equivalent fractions.
