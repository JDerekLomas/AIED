In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), where students are moving from basic arithmetic to algebraic fluency, a very common pitfall when dealing with fractions is the **"Component-Wise Addition"** error.

### 1. The specific misconception: Component-Wise Addition (The "Add Across" Bug)
This misconception involves treating the numerators, denominators, and whole numbers as entirely independent integers. Instead of finding a common denominator, the student applies the logic of whole-number addition (or fraction multiplication) to addition: they simply add the two numerators together and the two denominators together.

### 2. How a student would work through this question:
A student with this misconception would ignore the need for a lowest common multiple (LCM) of 10 and 4. Their thought process would look like this:

*   **Step 1 (Whole Numbers):** "I’ll add the large numbers first. $2 + 2 = 4$."
*   **Step 2 (Numerators):** "Now I’ll add the top numbers. $7 + 1 = 8$."
*   **Step 3 (Denominators):** "Now I’ll add the bottom numbers. $10 + 4 = 14$."
*   **Step 4 (Combine):** "Put them back together as a mixed number: $4 \frac{8}{14}$."

### 3. Which answer option this leads to:
This leads directly to **Option D: \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \)**.

### 4. How natural/attractive this error is:
This error is extremely "sticky" and attractive for several reasons:

*   **Intuitive Logic:** Students are taught from a young age that $2+2=4$ and $7+1=8$. It feels logically consistent to apply this "straight-line" thinking to denominators.
*   **Rule Over-generalization:** In the UK curriculum, students recently learned to multiply fractions (where you *do* multiply across). They often over-generalize this rule to addition, thinking that "doing the same thing to the top and bottom" is a universal law of fractions.
*   **Lack of Estimation:** A student making this error rarely checks the "reasonableness" of their answer. $\frac{8}{14}$ is slightly more than a half. A student won't realize they have gone wrong because they haven't stopped to think: "I have 7 tenths and 1 quarter; that should be almost a whole." 
*   **The "Invisible" Correct Answer:** Because Option B ($4 \frac{19}{20}$) looks more complex and requires more steps (finding 20 as a denominator), the simplicity of Option D makes it look more "correct" to a struggling student. They would likely feel confident in their answer and see no reason to double-check their method.
