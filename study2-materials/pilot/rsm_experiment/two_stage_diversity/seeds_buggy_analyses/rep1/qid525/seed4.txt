In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), where students are moving from basic arithmetic to algebraic fractions, a very common and persistent error involves the "Independent Components" strategy for fractions.

### 1. The specific misconception: **Component-wise Addition (The "Add Across" Error)**
The specific bug is treating a fraction as two independent integers (a numerator and a denominator) rather than a single numerical value. When applied to mixed numbers, the student adds the whole numbers correctly but then adds the numerators together and the denominators together. 

In pedagogical research, this is often called the **"Whole-Number Bias"**, where students apply the intuitive rules of addition ($a+b$) to the individual components of the fraction.

### 2. Step-by-step student working
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:
1.  **Add the whole numbers:** They look at the "big" numbers ($2$ and $2$) and add them: $2 + 2 = 4$.
2.  **Add the numerators:** They look at the top numbers ($7$ and $1$) and add them: $7 + 1 = 8$.
3.  **Add the denominators:** They look at the bottom numbers ($10$ and $4$) and add them: $10 + 4 = 14$.
4.  **Combine:** They put these results back into a mixed number format to get $4 \frac{8}{14}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \)**.

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This error is **highly attractive** and is perhaps the most common mistake seen in Year 9 fraction assessments. 

*   **Logic:** It feels consistent with how we add almost everything else in early mathematics. When we add 25 and 13, we add the tens and then the units. To a student, adding the whole numbers, then the numerators, then the denominators feels like a logical, "tidy" extension of this place-value logic.
*   **Ease:** It bypasses the "difficult" step of finding a Common Lowest Multiple (in this case, 20). Because it is much faster and requires less cognitive load, students often default to it when they are rushing or lack confidence.
*   **Self-Correction:** A student is **very unlikely to realize they went wrong.** Because the answer "looks" like a mixed number and uses all the digits provided in the question, it yields a sense of "false fluency." Unless the student has a strong sense of estimation (realising that $7/10$ is more than $1/2$, so the answer must be closer to $5$ than $4.5$), $4 \frac{8}{14}$ seems perfectly plausible to them.
