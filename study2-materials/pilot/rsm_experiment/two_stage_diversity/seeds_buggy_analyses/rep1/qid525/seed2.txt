As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent procedural error that frequently occurs in the UK curriculum at Key Stage 3 (Ages 11–14).

### 1. The specific misconception: "Adding Across" (Independent Component Addition)
This misconception is specifically the **Addition of Denominators bug**. Students treat the fractions within the mixed numbers as independent sets of integers, applying the same logic to the bottom numbers (denominators) as they do to the top numbers (numerators) and whole numbers.

### 2. Step-by-step student work
A student with this misconception would approach the calculation in these distinct steps:

1.  **Add the whole numbers:** The student identifies $2$ and $2$. They calculate $2 + 2 = 4$. They set this aside as the whole number part of their answer.
2.  **Add the numerators:** The student looks at the fractions $\frac{7}{10}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$. They add the numerators together: $7 + 1 = 8$.
3.  **Add the denominators (The Bug):** Instead of finding a common denominator (e.g., $20$), the student applies the same "addition" logic to the bottom numbers: $10 + 4 = 14$.
4.  **Combine the components:** The student brings the three parts together to form a single mixed number: **$4 \frac{8}{14}$**.

### 3. Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D**.

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This is a **highly "attractive" error** because it follows the rule of consistency. Students have been taught for years that when they multiply fractions, they "multiply across" (numerator × numerator, denominator × denominator). Therefore, "adding across" feels like a natural, intuitive extension of that rule.

The student is unlikely to realise they have gone wrong for two reasons:
*   **Logical Symmetry:** It feels mathematically "fair" to do the same thing to the bottom of the fraction as you do to the top.
*   **No Red Flags:** The resulting answer $4 \frac{8}{14}$ "looks" right. It is roughly the correct size (slightly more than 4), and $8/14$ is a proper fraction. Without the self-checking habit of estimation or a firm grasp on the concept that a denominator represents the *size* of the parts (which cannot be added) rather than the *count* of the parts, the student will feel confident in their answer.
