As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, the specific error identified here is the **Literal BIDMAS/BODMAS Interpretation bug**.

### 1. The specific misconception: Literal BIDMAS/BODMAS Interpretation
Many students are taught the acronym **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) but treat it as a strict, linear rank rather than a layered hierarchy. 

The "bug" occurs because they believe **Addition (A)** *must* always be performed before **Subtraction (S)** simply because the letter 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym. They fail to understand that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be performed from left to right. Similarly, they may over-apply this by looking for any addition sign first, regardless of other operations.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the problems as follows:

*   **Problem P: \(4 - 5 + 6\)**
    1.  The student scans the operations: Subtraction and Addition.
    2.  Recalling "BIDMAS," they note that 'A' comes before 'S'.
    3.  They identify the addition component as \(5 + 6\).
    4.  They conclude they must do **\(5 + 6\)** first. (This is a procedural error because the negative sign attached to the 5 is ignored, effectively turning the problem into \(4 - (5 + 6)\)).

*   **Problem Q: \(4 + 5 \times 6\)**
    1.  The student scans the operations: Addition and Multiplication.
    2.  They incorrectly apply the same linear logic or a "left-to-right" reading habit, or they revert to a different bug: "Always do Addition first." 
    3.  However, most commonly in this specific configuration (Option C/D), the student fixates on the **"Addition before Subtraction"** rule for P and carries the "Addition first" preference over to Q, or they simply read Q from left to right as if no hierarchy exists. 
    4.  In the context of the options provided, the student identifies **\(4 + 5\)** as the first step for Q.

### 3. Answer Option
This misconception leads to **Option C**:
*   **Problem P:** \(5 + 6\)
*   **Problem Q:** \(4 + 5\)

### 4. Attractiveness of the error
This is an incredibly "sticky" and natural error for a Year 9 student. It is seductive because:
*   **Mnemonic Over-reliance:** The student is trying to follow the rule they were taught. In their mind, they are being "diligent" by looking for the 'A' before the 'S'. 
*   **Linguistic Priming:** The way we say "Addition and Subtraction" naturally places addition first.
*   **Visual Appeal:** In \(4 - 5 + 6\), the \(5 + 6\) sits together neatly at the end of the expression. Adding two positive-looking integers feels "easier" and more "natural" than dealing with the negative result of \(4 - 5\).

**Would the student realize?** No. They would likely feel quite confident. To them, they are applying the "Gold Standard" rule (BIDMAS) correctly. Without understanding that addition and subtraction are "sister operations," they see their choice not as an error, but as the strict application of mathematical law.
