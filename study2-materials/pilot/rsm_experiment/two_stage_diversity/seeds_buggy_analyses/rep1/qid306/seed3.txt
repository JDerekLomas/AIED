In the context of the UK Year 9 curriculum, where order of operations is often taught using the acronym **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction), the following analysis identifies the most common student error for this specific problem.

### 1. The Misconception: Rigid Hierarchy of Operations
The specific misconception is the **Rigid Hierarchical Priority bug**.

Students often believe that because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym **BIDMAS/BODMAS**, addition *must* be performed before subtraction regardless of its position in the equation. They fail to understand that Addition and Subtraction have **equal priority** and should be processed from left to right.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the two problems as follows:

*   **For Problem P ($4 - 5 + 6$):**
    1.  The student looks at the symbols: one subtraction (S) and one addition (A).
    2.  They recall the acronym (BIDMAS). Since 'A' appears before 'S', they decide they must add first.
    3.  They isolate the addition part: $5 + 6 = 11$.
    4.  They conclude the first calculation to perform is **$5 + 6$**. (Note: This often leads to the incorrect final answer of $4 - 11 = -7$ instead of the correct $5$).

*   **For Problem Q ($4 + 5 \times 6$):**
    1.  The student looks at the symbols: one addition (A) and one multiplication (M).
    2.  They recall BIDMAS. Since 'M' appears before 'A', they correctly identify that multiplication must happen first.
    3.  They conclude the first calculation is **$5 \times 6$**.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D**.
*   Problem P: $5 + 6$
*   Problem Q: $5 \times 6$

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and pervasive. For many Year 9 students, it feels mathematically "logical" because it follows the literal string of letters they have been taught to memorize since Year 7.

The student would likely **not realize they have gone wrong**. To them, they are following the "rules" of the acronym perfectly. The nuance that Addition/Subtraction (and Multiplication/Division) are "partner operations" with equal priority is often missed during initial learning or forgotten over time. If they see the correct answer (B), they may even argue against it, believing that doing $4 - 5$ first is "breaking the rule" of BIDMAS.
