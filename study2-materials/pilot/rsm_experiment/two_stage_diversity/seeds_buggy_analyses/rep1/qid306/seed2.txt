In the context of the UK Year 9 curriculum, a student would typically use the **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction) mnemonic to determine the order of operations.

Here is the breakdown of a specific misconception related to this question.

### 1. The specific misconception: "Strict Alphabetical Hierarchy"
The specific bug is the **strict interpretation of the BIDMAS mnemonic as a fixed linear hierarchy**. While Multiplication/Division and Addition/Subtraction actually carry equal priority (and should be completed left-to-right), many students believe that because "A" (Addition) comes before "S" (Subtraction) in the acronym, **all additions must be completed before any subtractions**, regardless of their position in the expression.

### 2. Step-by-step student reasoning
A student with this misconception would approach the problems as follows:

*   **Problem P ($4 - 5 + 6$):** 
    *   The student looks at the operators (minus and plus).
    *   They recall "BIDMAS." Since **A** comes before **S**, they believe addition is a higher-priority operation.
    *   They identify the addition as $5 + 6$ (often ignoring the negative sign attached to the 5).
    *   **Decision:** They decide they must do **$5 + 6$** first.

*   **Problem Q ($4 + 5 \times 6$):**
    *   The student looks at the operators (plus and multiply).
    *   They recall "BIDMAS." Since **M** comes before **A**, they correctly identify that multiplication takes priority.
    *   **Decision:** They decide they must do **$5 \times 6$** first.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads the student to **Option D**.

*   Problem P: $5 + 6$
*   Problem Q: $5 \times 6$

*(The mathematically correct answer is Option B, as P should be solved left-to-right).*

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This error is **highly attractive** and one of the most common "sticky" misconceptions in Key Stage 3. 

*   **Logic:** The student feels they are being a "good mathematician" by strictly following the rules of the acronym they were taught. 
*   **Cognitive Ease:** Doing "addition before subtraction" feels intuitive because the acronym is read from left to right.
*   **Lack of Feedback:** If the student carries out $4 - (5 + 6)$ and gets $-7$, they have arrived at a "clean" number. Without a calculator or a teacher to point out that $4 - 5 + 6$ actually equals $5$, the student would have **no reason to believe they were wrong**. They followed their rule perfectly; the rule itself was simply incomplete.
