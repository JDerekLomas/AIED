In my experience, Year 9 students often struggle when algebra interacts with fraction arithmetic, particularly when "balancing" equations.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Inverse-Integer Multiplication"
The specific bug is the **partial application of the inverse operation**, where the student correctly identifies that they must divide by 3, but fails to treat the right-hand side as a fraction. Instead of performing a formal division of fractions, they intuitively "pair" the integer coefficient with the denominator through multiplication.

While this accidentally leads to the correct result in some cases, the underlying misconception is **Operation Reversal for Scaling**: the student believes that to move a "3" from the numerator of the left side, it simply becomes a multiplier for the denominator of the right side because "division and multiplication go together."

### 2. The Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would work as follows:
1. **Identify the goal:** "I need to get $p$ on its own, so I must move the 3."
2. **Apply the inverse:** "The 3 is multiplying $p$, so I must divide the other side by 3."
3. **Execute the buggy calculation:** Looking at $1/12$, the student sees the 12. Instead of performing $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$, they think: "There is already a 12 on the bottom. To divide by 3, I just multiply that 12 by 3."
4. **Final Step:** They calculate $12 \times 3 = 36$ and place it back in the denominator: $p = \frac{1}{36}$.

*(Note: While this specific procedure happens to lead to the correct answer B in this case, the student isn't following the division of fractions rule—$\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$—but is rather following a "shunting" rule where they move the number from the top-left to the bottom-right.)*

### 3. Answer Option
This logic leads to **Option B: $p = \frac{1}{36}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and often "invisible" to the student because:
*   **Physicality:** It feels "neat." The student physically moves the 3 from the top of the left side to the bottom of the right side. This visual symmetry makes it feel like a correct algebraic "move."
*   **Ease of Calculation:** Multiplying 12 by 3 is cognitively much easier than performing formal fraction division or thinking about reciprocals.
*   **The Trap of the "Sensible" Number:** The result, 36, is a "friendly" number that relates clearly to the 3 and 12 in the question.

**Would the student realize they were wrong?**
Almost certainly **no**. Because 36 is a multiple of 12 and 3, the answer "looks" mathematically related to the prompt. A student would only realize their error if they were prompted to substitute $1/36$ back into the original equation (e.g., $3 \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{3}{36}$). However, most Year 9 students would simplify $3/36$ to $1/12$ and assume they were correct, never realizing that they may have just followed a flawed shortcut rather than a robust principle.
