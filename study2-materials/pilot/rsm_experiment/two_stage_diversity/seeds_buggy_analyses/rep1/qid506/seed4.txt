In my experience, Year 9 students (aged 13–14) frequently encounter "conceptual interference" when algebraic operations intersect with fractions.

### 1. The Misconception: Operation Inversion (Multiplying the Denominator)
The specific bug is **Misapplied Reciprocal Multiplication**. Instead of dividing by 3 (which is equivalent to multiplying the fraction by $\frac{1}{3}$), the student intuitively feels that the "3" should interact only with the denominator "12" through the operation they associate most closely with 3 and 12 in their times tables: **division**.

They perform the operation **$12 \div 3$** rather than $12 \times 3$ because they see a large number in the denominator and a smaller whole number, and their "number sense" tells them the answer should be a simpler integer like 4.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would work as follows:
*   **Step 1:** Look at $3p = \frac{1}{12}$ and identify that to find $p$, they need to "move" the 3 to the other side.
*   **Step 2:** They recognise that 3 is multiplying $p$, so the inverse is division. 
*   **Step 3:** Instead of applying the division to the whole fraction ($\frac{1}{12} \div 3$), they apply the division directly to the denominator: $p = \frac{1}{(12 \div 3)}$.
*   **Step 4:** They calculate $12 \div 3 = 4$ and place this in the denominator.
*   **Result:** $p = \frac{1}{4}$.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option A ($p = \frac{1}{4}$)**.

### 4. Attractiveness and "The Confidence Trap"
This is a **highly attractive** error for a Year 9 student for several reasons:

*   **Fact Family Fluency:** The numbers 3 and 12 have a very strong cognitive link to the number 4. In a high-pressure or "low-stakes" practice environment, the student’s brain chooses the path of least resistance (division) rather than the technically correct path (multiplication of the denominator).
*   **Visual Proximity:** The 3 and the 12 are "on the bottom half" of the mental workspace if the student thinks of division.
*   **False "Reasonableness":** A student who gets $\frac{1}{36}$ (the correct answer, B) might actually think *their* answer looks wrong because $\frac{1}{36}$ is such a small, "ugly" number compared to the "neat" fraction $\frac{1}{4}$.

The student would almost certainly **not realize they went wrong.** They followed the "rule" of doing the opposite (dividing) and used their times tables correctly. Without a habit of checking their answer by substituting $\frac{1}{4}$ back into the equation ($3 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$, which $\neq \frac{1}{12}$), they will move on to the next question with total confidence.
