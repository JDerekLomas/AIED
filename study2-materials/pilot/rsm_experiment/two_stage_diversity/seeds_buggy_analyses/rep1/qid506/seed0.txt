In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (GCSE Foundation level), the most prevalent misconception for this specific problem is the **"Inverse Operation Overgeneralisation"** or, more colloquially, **"Multiplying by the Numerator."**

### 1. The Misconception: "Multiplying by the Numerator"
The student understands the concept of "doing the inverse" to isolate $p$, but they apply the operation incorrectly to the components of the fraction. Rather than dividing both sides by 3 (which is equivalent to multiplying the denominator by 3), the student identifies that there is a "3" and a "12" and believes that the "opposite" of multiplying by 3 is to "multiply the 12 by 1/3" or simply **dividing the denominator by the coefficient.**

Essentially, the student incorrectly assumes that to divide a fraction by a whole number, you divide the bottom number by that whole number.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would work through the problem as follows:
*   **Step 1:** Observe the equation $3p = \frac{1}{12}$.
*   **Step 2:** Recognise that to find $p$, they must "undo" the multiplication by 3.
*   **Step 3:** Perform the operation: $p = \frac{1}{12 \div 3}$. 
*   **Step 4:** Calculate $12 \div 3 = 4$.
*   **Step 5:** Place the result back into the denominator to get $p = \frac{1}{4}$.

### 3. Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: $p = \frac{1}{4}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and often feels "natural" to a Year 9 student for several reasons:
*   **Number Sense Illusion:** $12$ and $3$ are "friendly" numbers. The student sees a 12 and a 3 and instinctively wants to create a 4. This feels mathematically "tidy."
*   **Fluency Confusion:** Students are often taught that "multiplication and division are opposites." When they see the multiplication on the left ($3 \times p$), they know they need a division. They see the division on the right (the fraction bar) and assume they should apply the inverse to the denominator specifically.
*   **Lack of Fractional Awareness:** Many students at this level struggle to conceptualise that dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by $\frac{1}{3}$. To them, $p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$ feels "wrong" because the denominator is getting *larger*, and they often equate "division" with the result becoming a *smaller* value (conceptually confusing the value of the denominator with the value of the fraction itself).

The student would likely **not realize they went wrong** because $1/4$ is a clean, familiar fraction and is prominently featured as the first multiple-choice option, providing false validation of their method.
