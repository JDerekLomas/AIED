As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a primary error often seen in Year 9 students regarding this specific set of data.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "The Zero-Value Omission Bug"
This is a **conceptual misconception** where a student believes that the number zero does not "count" as data because it represents nothing or has no numerical magnitude. In statistics, this manifests as treating $0$ as a placeholder or a null value rather than a legitimate data point in the frequency count.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Thinking
A student with this misconception would approach the question as follows:
*   **Step 1:** Read the list of numbers: $0, 1, 3, 4, 7$.
*   **Step 2:** Identify the numbers that need to be summed. Because they believe $0$ adds nothing to a total, they mentally discard it, focusing only on the non-zero digits: $1, 3, 4, 7$.
*   **Step 3:** Count the number of items ($n$) to divide by. Since they have discounted the zero as "not being there," they count only the four remaining non-zero terms.
*   **Step 4:** Formulate the calculation as: $\frac{\text{Sum of non-zero values}}{\text{Count of non-zero values}} = \frac{1+3+4+7}{4}$.

### 3. The Corresponding Option
This misconception leads the student directly to **Option C**: $\frac{1+3+4+7}{4}$.

### 4. Attractiveness and Realisation
This is an **extremely attractive error** for Year 9 students because it feels intuitively logical. Students are often taught that adding zero "does nothing" to a total, which they incorrectly extend to mean it "does nothing" to an average. 

The student is **highly unlikely to realise they are wrong**. In their mind:
*   They followed the "Add them all up and divide by how many there are" rule.
*   They see their exact resulting calculation listed as a Distractor (Option C), which provides them with immediate "confirmation bias" that their logic is sound.
*   Unless they compare the result to a physical model (like balancing blocks), the mathematical answer they get ($\frac{15}{4} = 3.75$) seems perfectly plausible compared to the correct mean ($3$).

***

*Note: A secondary bug is also present in Option B (**The Order of Operations/Linear Entry Bug**), where a student ignores the implicit brackets in a fraction and enters the numbers into a calculator linearly ($0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$), which results in $0+1+3+4+1.4$. While common, Option C represents the deeper conceptual misunderstanding of the data set itself.*
