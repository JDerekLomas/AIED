In this scenario, a Year 9 student is most likely to select **Option A** due to a specific conceptual and procedural error regarding the number zero.

### 1. The Misconception: "Zero Doesn’t Count" (Additive Neutrality Bug)
The student suffers from the **Additive Neutrality Misconception**. This occurs when a student conflates the value of a number with its significance as a data point. Because adding zero does not change the total sum, the student subconsciously filters it out as "nothing," leading them to believe it can be omitted from the formal expression of the sum.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Thinking
*   **Step 1:** The student recalls the formula for the mean: "Add them all up and divide by how many there are."
*   **Step 2 (The Bug):** They look at the list: $0, 1, 3, 4, 7$. They mentally or physically perform the addition: $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15$. Because $0$ did not contribute to the total of $15$, they omit it when writing down the calculation.
*   **Step 3:** They count the numbers to determine the divisor. They see five distinct digits, so they correctly identify $n=5$.
*   **Step 4:** They look for a calculation that shows the sum of the "active" numbers ($1, 3, 4, 7$) divided by the total count ($5$).

### 3. The Corresponding Option
This misconception leads the student directly to **Option A**: $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$.

*(Note: If the student had also miscounted the number of data points because of the zero, they would have chosen Option C, but Option A represents a more specific procedural stage where they understand the count of 5 but feel that $0$ is "invisible" in a sum.)*

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly natural and extremely attractive** to a Year 9 student. 

From their earliest years in primary school, students are taught that zero is the identity element for addition—it has no "power" in a sum. When they see a mean calculation, they view it as an efficiency problem. Writing "0 +" feels redundant to them, much like writing "0 + 5" in an algebra equation would feel unnecessary. 

The student is **very unlikely to realize they are wrong** because their final answer $(\frac{15}{5} = 3)$ "looks" right. The mean of 3 feels statistically plausible for a set of numbers ranging from 0 to 7. Because the calculation remains balanced (using 5 as the divisor), the student feels they have correctly accounted for the "size" of the set while being "efficient" by ignoring the zero in the numerator.
