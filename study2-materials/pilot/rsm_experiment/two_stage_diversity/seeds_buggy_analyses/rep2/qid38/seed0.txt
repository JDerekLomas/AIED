In the context of UK Year 9 Algebra (Algebraic Fractions), here is a breakdown of a common misconception for this specific question.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "The Universal Add-Across Bug"
This is a combination of two procedural errors: **Freshman’s Dream (Applied to Fractions)** and **Ignoring the Coefficients of Denominators**. 

The student treats the fraction components (numerators and denominators) as independent whole numbers. They believe that to add two fractions, you simply add the top numbers together and add the bottom expressions together, regardless of whether the denominators are common.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Reasoning
A student with this misconception would approach the problem without looking for a Least Common Multiple (LCM):

1.  **Add the Numerators:** The student looks at the top values ($3$ and $4$) and performs $3 + 4 = 7$.
2.  **Add the Denominators:** The student looks at the bottom values ($2x$ and $x$) and performs $2x + x$. Because they often view $x$ as "one $x$", they calculate $2 + 1$ to get $3x$.
3.  **Assemble the Fraction:** They place the new numerator over the new denominator to get $\frac{7}{3x}$.
4.  **Simplify:** If they cannot see a common factor (which they can't here), they assume the work is complete.

### 3. Which Answer Option?
This misconception leads directly to **Option B: $\frac{7}{3x}$**.

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This error is **highly attractive and extremely common** for Year 9 students for several reasons:

*   **False Consistency:** It mirrors how students perform multiplication of fractions (top $\times$ top, bottom $\times$ bottom). The student is trying to apply a rule they already know works for another operation to addition.
*   **Path of Least Resistance:** Finding a common denominator (which would be $2x$) requires a multi-step "balanced" multiplication ($\frac{4}{x} \times \frac{2}{2}$). The "add-across" method feels more intuitive because it is faster and requires fewer steps.
*   **The "Invisible 1" Difficulty:** Many Year 9 students still struggle to see $x$ as $1x$. However, even if they realize $x$ is $1x$, their instinct to simply combine $2+1$ to make $3$ is stronger than their understanding of equivalent fractions.
*   **Lack of Self-Correction:** The student would **not** realize they went wrong. To them, the logic is "Sum of Parts = Sum of Whole." Because the result $\frac{7}{3x}$ looks like a "neater" single fraction, it provides a false sense of achievement. Unless they are taught to check their answer by substituting a value (e.g., if $x=1$), they have no internal mechanism to spot the flaw in their logic.
