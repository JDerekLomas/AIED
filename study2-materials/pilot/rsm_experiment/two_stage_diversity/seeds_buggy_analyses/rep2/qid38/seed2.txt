In the context of UK Year 9 algebraic fractions, a common misconception involves a "linear" approach to adding terms, treating algebraic denominators like simple integers or disregarding the need for a common denominator.

### 1. The specific misconception: "Add Across" Numerators and Denominators
The specific bug is **The Add-Across Error (Direct Addition)**. Students with this misconception treat the fraction bar as a separator for two independent addition problems rather than seeing the expression as two proportions requiring a common base. They apply the (correct) logic of multiplying fractions (top × top, bottom × bottom) to the process of adding fractions.

### 2. Step-by-step student work
A student with this misconception would process the expression as follows:

*   **Step 1:** Look at the numerators (3 and 4) and add them together: $3 + 4 = 7$.
*   **Step 2:** Look at the denominators ($2x$ and $x$) and add them together: $2x + x = 3x$.
*   **Step 3:** Place the sum of the numerators over the sum of the denominators.
*   **Step 4:** Result = $\frac{7}{3x}$.

Alternatively, the student might view the $x$ as a "unit" and add the coefficients ($2+1=3$) and the numerators, leading to the same result.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads directly to **Option B: $\frac{7}{3x}$**.

### 4. How natural/attractive this error is
This error is **highly attractive** and one of the most persistent "bugs" in secondary mathematics. 

*   **Intuition over Logic:** It follows a "common sense" path. In many other areas of Year 9 algebra, we combine like terms ($3a + 4a = 7a$). The student is incorrectly applying "combining like terms" logic to the numerators and denominators independently.
*   **Procedural Confusion:** Students often confuse the rules for multiplication ($\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}$) with addition. Because the "Add Across" method is much faster than finding a common denominator, the student feels a sense of efficiency.
*   **Lack of Self-Correction:** The student would likely **not realize they went wrong**. Because Option B is present, it reinforces their confidence in the incorrect method ("I got one of the options, so I must be right"). Unlike a calculation that results in a messy decimal, $\frac{7}{3x}$ looks "clean" and "simple," which satisfies the student's expectation of what a simplified answer should look like.
