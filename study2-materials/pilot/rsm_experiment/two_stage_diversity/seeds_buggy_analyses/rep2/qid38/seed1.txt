In the context of UK Year 9 Algebra (Algebraic Fractions), here is a breakdown of a highly common misconception.

### 1. The Misconception: "Naive Numerator & Denominator Addition"
This procedural error occurs when a student treats algebraic fractions as "multi-part objects" rather than values. They apply a **"Horizontal Addition"** strategy, simply adding the two top numbers together and the two bottom expressions together, independent of each other. This is a carry-over from a common primary-level misconception with numerical fractions, where students ignore the rule that a common denominator must be found before addition.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Work
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:

*   **Step 1:** Look at the numerators (3 and 4) and add them together: $3 + 4 = 7$.
*   **Step 2:** Look at the denominators ($2x$ and $x$) and add them together. Since $2x + x = 3x$, they conclude the new denominator is $3x$.
*   **Step 3:** Place the sum of the numerators over the sum of the denominators to create the final fraction: $\frac{7}{3x}$.
*   **Step 4:** Check if it can be simplified further. Since $7$ and $3$ share no factors, they stop there.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option B: $\frac{7}{3x}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive and natural** for several reasons:

*   **Consistency with Multiplication:** Students have recently learned that when *multiplying* fractions, you do exactly this (multiply the tops, multiply the bottoms). They intuitively apply this "straight across" logic to addition, seeking a uniform rule for all fraction operations.
*   **Cognitive Ease:** Finding a common denominator requires multiple steps (identifying the LCM, adjusting the numerators). Simply adding across is cognitively "cheaper" and feels like progress.
*   **The "Illusion of Correctness":** Because $2x + x = 3x$ is algebraically correct in isolation, the student feels they have successfully demonstrated their algebra skills. They are unlikely to realize they are wrong because their final answer "looks" like a simplified algebraic fraction, and the steps they took felt logical. Without a strong conceptual understanding of why a common denominator is required (i.e., that denominators represent the "size" of the parts), they will see no reason to doubt their result.
