In the context of UK Year 9 Algebra (Algebraic Fractions), here is a breakdown of a highly common misconception for this specific problem.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Add-Across" Numerators and Denominators
The specific bug is **The Additive Fraction Error** (sometimes called the "Freshman’s Dream" for fractions). The student treats algebraic fractions like they sometimes (erroneously) treat numerical fractions: by adding the numerators and adding the denominators independently, without finding a common denominator.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:
*   **Step 1:** Look at the numerators ($3$ and $4$) and add them together: $3 + 4 = 7$.
*   **Step 2:** Look at the denominators ($2x$ and $x$) and add them together. They see one $2x$ and one "invisible" $1x$.
*   **Step 3:** Perform the addition $2x + x = 3x$.
*   **Step 4:** Place the new numerator over the new denominator to get $\frac{7}{3x}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This procedure leads directly to **Option B: $\frac{7}{3x}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **extremely natural** and seductive for Year 9 students for several reasons:

*   **Logical Symmetry:** In the student’s mind, addition is a "combining" action. Combining the tops and combining the bottoms feels intuitive and fair. 
*   **Cognitive Ease:** Finding a common denominator requires the student to recognize that $\frac{4}{x}$ is equivalent to $\frac{8}{2x}$. This involves multiplication and "re-imagining" a fraction, which is cognitively more taxing than simple addition.
*   **Lack of Internal Conflict:** The student would likely **not realise they went wrong**. To a student who makes this error, $\frac{7}{3x}$ looks "simpler" than the starting expression (meeting the criteria of the question), and because the result $7$ and $3x$ appear as "clean" sums of the original parts, it provides a false sense of fluency. 
*   **The Trap of Option B:** Because $7$ and $3x$ are explicitly derived from the numbers in the question, seeing $\frac{7}{3x}$ as a multiple-choice option confirms their bias that their method was correct. 

*(Note: The correct answer is A, found by converting $\frac{4}{x}$ to $\frac{8}{2x}$ and adding $3+8$.)*
