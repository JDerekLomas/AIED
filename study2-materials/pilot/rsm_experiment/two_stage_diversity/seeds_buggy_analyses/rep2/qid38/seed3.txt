In Year 9 (ages 13–14), students are transitioning from numerical fractions to algebraic fractions. The most common pitfall in this specific problem is a misunderstanding of how denominators combine when they contain variables.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Add-Everything" (Independent Numerator and Denominator Addition)

This error is known as **"The Freshmen’s Error"** (or more generally, failing to find a common denominator). In this specific algebraic context, the student treats the numerators and denominators as independent addition problems, ignoring the rule that fractions must have a common denominator before they can be combined.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the problem like this:

*   **Step 1 (Numerator):** The student looks at the top values and adds them together: $3 + 4 = 7$.
*   **Step 2 (Denominator):** The student looks at the bottom values. Instead of identifying that $2x$ and $x$ are different units, they simply add the terms: $2x + x$. 
*   **Step 3 (Variable manipulation):** Because the student is often shaky on collecting like terms, they calculate $2x + x$ as $3x$. (Alternatively, if they treat it purely as strings of symbols, they see two $x$'s and a $2$ and result in $3x$).
*   **Step 4 (Final Assembly):** They place the sum of the numerators over the sum of the denominators to get $\frac{7}{3x}$.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option B: $\frac{7}{3x}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly natural and incredibly attractive** for three reasons:

*   **Intuitive Symmetry:** Students find it "fair" to do the same operation to the top as they do to the bottom. Adding across is the simplest path of least resistance.
*   **Overgeneralisation:** The student is incorrectly applying the rule for *multiplying* fractions (where you do multiply across the top and bottom) to an *addition* problem. Since multiplication of fractions is often taught shortly before or after addition, the procedures often "blur" in the student's mind.
*   **Lack of Internal Feedback:** Unlike a subtraction problem where "adding across" might result in a zero denominator (which might look "weird" to a student), $\frac{7}{3x}$ looks like a perfectly valid, "simplified" algebraic fraction. Without a strong conceptual understanding of what a denominator represents (the size of the "parts"), the student has no reason to suspect their method is flawed; they followed a procedure that felt mathematically consistent with their previous experiences.
