In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), students are moving toward fluency with fractions, but foundational "bugs" often resurface when operations become multi-step.

### 1. The Misconception: "Independent Integer and Component-wise Addition" (specifically applied to denominators)
The specific bug here is **Adding Denominators**. The student correctly identifies that they can add the whole numbers (integers) separately, but incorrectly treats the fractions as "top numbers" and "bottom numbers" to be added independently, ignoring the need for a common denominator.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the problem using these steps:

1.  **Add the whole numbers:** The student sees $2 + 2$ and correctly calculates **4**.
2.  **Add the numerators:** They treat the top numbers of the fractions as a separate addition: $7 + 1 = \mathbf{8}$.
3.  **Add the denominators (The Bug):** Instead of finding a common denominator (20), they treat the bottom numbers as a separate addition: $10 + 4 = \mathbf{14}$.
4.  **Combine:** They join the integer and the new "fraction" to get $4 \frac{8}{14}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $4 \frac{8}{14}$**.

### 4. How "Natural" or Attractive is this Error?
This is one of the most pervasive "high-attraction" errors in secondary mathematics.

*   **Logic Consistency:** To a student, this feels logically consistent with how they multiply fractions (where you multiply both top and bottom) and how they add integers.
*   **Cognitive Ease:** Finding a common denominator requires several steps (finding the Lowest Common Multiple, scaling the numerators, and then adding). Adding horizontally across the numerators and denominators is much faster and requires significantly less "working memory."
*   **The "Sensibility" Trap:** A student is unlikely to realize they are wrong because the answer "looks" right. $4 \frac{8}{14}$ (which simplifies to $4 \frac{4}{7}$) is roughly $4.5$. Since $2.7 + 2.25 = 4.95$, the incorrect answer is in the "correct ballpark," providing a false sense of security. Without a strong conceptual understanding that the denominator represents the *size* of the parts (which cannot be added together), the student will not see a reason to question their result.
