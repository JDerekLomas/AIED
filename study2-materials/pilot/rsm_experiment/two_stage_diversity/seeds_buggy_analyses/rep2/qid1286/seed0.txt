As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific and highly common procedural error for this problem.

### 1. The specific misconception: **Inversion Order Bug (Division/Multiplication Swap)**
The "Inversion Order Bug" occurs when a student understands that they must perform inverse operations to rearrange a formula, but fails to correctly treat the fractional coefficient ($\frac{4}{3}$) and the constant ($\pi$) as a single product. Specifically, the student incorrectly attempts to "undo" the fraction by multiplying by the numerator and dividing by the denominator, essentially performing the operation $(V \times 4) \div 3$ rather than $(V \times 3) \div 4$.

### 2. The step-by-step student work
A student with this misconception would proceed as follows:
1.  **Recall the formula:** $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.
2.  **Isolate $r$ (Error begins):** The student sees the "4" on the top of the fraction and the "3" on the bottom. Instead of multiplying both sides by 3 to "move" the denominator, they intuitively associate the 4 with the "outer" operation or simply multiply the Volume by the numerator.
3.  **Algebraic manipulation:**
    *   They "move" the 4 to the left by multiplying: $4V = 3\pi r^3$
    *   They "move" the 3 to the left by dividing: $\frac{4V}{3} = \pi r^3$
4.  **Finish isolating $r$:**
    *   Divide by $\pi$: $\frac{4V}{3\pi} = r^3$
    *   Take the cube root: $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}$

### 3. The resulting answer option
This specific misconception leads the student directly to **Option B**: $\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm}$.

### 4. How attractive/natural is this error?
This error is **highly attractive** and often feels "correct" to a Year 9 student for several reasons:

*   **Visual Mimicry:** In Option B, the 4 remains "on top" and the 3 remains "on bottom," mirroring the original formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. Students who lack confidence in literal equations often prefer answers that look visually similar to the starting formula.
*   **A "Guessable" Trap:** Students often struggle with the rule that "to undo a fraction, you multiply by the reciprocal." Without this specific rule, a student is likely to treat the numbers as individual entities and apply the "4" to the $V$ simply because 4 is more prominent in the original numerator.
*   **Confidence:** The student would likely **not realize they went wrong**. Because they performed "valid-looking" operations (multiplication, division, and cube-rooting), and their result is an exact match for one of the multiple-choice distractors, they would proceed with high confidence that they rearranged the formula correctly.
