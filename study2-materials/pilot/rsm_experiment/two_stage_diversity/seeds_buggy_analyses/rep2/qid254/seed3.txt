As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific and pervasive issue that occurs when students transition from primary arithmetic to secondary school statistics.

### 1. The Misconception: "Zero-Ignoring" (The Identity Bug)
The specific misconception is that **zero is not a "real" value or a data point** in a set. In arithmetic, the number zero is the additive identity (adding it changes nothing), and many students conflate "not changing the total" with "not existing as an observation."

Students often hold the "buggy" rule that because $0$ has no magnitude, it doesn't "count" towards the divisor when calculating an average.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with the **Zero-Ignoring** bug would approach the question as follows:

*   **Step 1:** Look at the data set $\{0, 1, 3, 4, 7\}$.
*   **Step 2:** Identify the values to sum. They would recognize $1+3+4+7=15$. They might include the $0$ in the sum mentally but conclude it makes no difference to the total.
*   **Step 3:** Count the number of items in the list. Because they see zero as a placeholder or a "non-value," they count only the "actual" numbers: $1, 3, 4,$ and $7$.
*   **Step 4:** They conclude there are **four** data points.
*   **Step 5:** They look for a calculation that divides the sum of the non-zero digits by $4$.

### 3. Resulting Answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option C**:
$$\frac{1+3+4+7}{4}$$

*(Note: Option A is also an attractive "trap" for a similar reason—the student recognizes the divisor should be 5 but ignores the 0 in the numerator, but Option C represents a more fundamental misunderstanding of what a 'data point' is.)*

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly natural and extremely attractive** to Year 9 students. There are three reasons they are unlikely to realize they are wrong:

1.  **Logical Consistency:** The student feels they are being efficient. If the total is $15$, they feel that dividing by $5$ "dilutes" the average unfairly with a number that "isn't there." 
2.  **Contextual Confusion:** In many real-world contexts (like sports scoring or temperature), a "0" is often treated as a "null" or "did not play." Students struggle to distinguish between a **missing value** (null) and a **recorded value of zero**.
3.  **Linguistic Cues:** Teachers often define the mean as "The sum of the numbers divided by how many numbers there are." The student argues that $0$ is "nothing," and "nothing" is not "a number" in a counting sense. 

Unless the student has been explicitly taught that zero is a critical piece of data (e.g., "The mean number of goals scored in a season includes the games where we scored zero"), they will view Option C as the most mathematically "honest" representation of the data's center.
