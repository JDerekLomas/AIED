In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), where students are transitionally moving from arithmetic fluency to algebraic priority, the following identification explores a common bug related to the data set provided.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Zero-Invisibility"
The misconception is the belief that **the number zero has no value and therefore does not count as a data point.** 

Students often conflate the *value* of the number with its *utility* in a calculation. They view zero as "nothing," leading them to ignore it entirely when determining the size of the set ($n$).

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with the "Zero-Invisibility" bug would approach the question as follows:

1.  **Examine the set:** Look at the numbers $0, 1, 3, 4, 7$.
2.  **Calculate the Sum:** Add the numbers together. They see $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15$. 
3.  **Determine the Divisor ($n$):** Instead of counting the items in the list (5 items), the student "discards" the zero because they feel it doesn't contribute to the average. They count only the non-zero digits ($1, 3, 4, 7$).
4.  **Conclude the Divisor:** They decide that because there are 4 "real" numbers, they must divide the sum by 4.
5.  **Formulate the fraction:** They construct the expression $\frac{1+3+4+7}{4}$.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads the student directly to **Option C**.

*(Note: Option A is also an attractive "trap" for a similar bug—knowing to divide by 5 but ignoring the 0 in the sum—but Option C is the more mathematically significant error as it changes the fundamental denominator of the mean.)*

### 4. Naturalness and Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive and often feels "correct" to a student.** 

*   **Logic:** The student’s internal logic is: *"If I have no apples today, it shouldn't pull down my average for the week."* They mistake the mean for the "average of the occurrences." 
*   **Lack of Friction:** Unlike a division-by-zero error which produces a mathematical "error" on a calculator, dividing by 4 yields a neat, terminating decimal (3.75). The student has no reason to doubt their result. 
*   **Intuition:** Because adding zero does not change the numerator ($15 + 0$ is still $15$), the student feels the zero is functionally redundant. They do not realize that while zero doesn't change the **sum**, it fundamentally changes the **distribution**, making Option C a very "comfortable" mistake for a Year 9 student who is not yet firm on the concept of zero as a placeholder in statistics.
