In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), while many students are proficient with basic addition, a persistent issue arises when operations involve fractions with common denominators.

### 1. The Misconception: "The Universal Additive Bug"
The specific misconception is **treating the denominator as a whole number quantity to be added**, rather than as a descriptor of the "size" or "type" of the parts. In procedural terms, the student follows the rule: *"Add everything across."* They treat the numerator and denominator as independent integers rather than as a single rational value.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would typically approach the problem by partitioning the mixed number but applying the wrong operation to the fractional components:

1.  **Add the whole numbers:** The student identifies the integers 2 and 1. They calculate $2 + 1 = 3$.
2.  **Add the numerators:** The student sees the 1 and the 2. They calculate $1 + 2 = 3$.
3.  **Add the denominators:** Instead of keeping the common denominator (fifths), the student applies the addition operation to the bottom numbers. They calculate $5 + 5 = 10$.
4.  **Recombine:** The student combines these results to get $3 \frac{3}{10}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D ($3 \frac{3}{10}$)**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is an **extremely high-frequency error** and is notoriously "sticky." Here is why the student would likely not realize they are wrong:

*   **Symmetry and Consistency:** Adding the numerators and the denominators feels "fair" and consistent with how multiplication of fractions works (where you multiply across both). The student feels they are applying a logical, uniform rule to all parts of the expression.
*   **Intuition Over Logic:** To a student, a fraction looks like two separate numbers. In their mind, $5+5$ simply *is* $10$; telling them $5+5$ results in $5$ (as in the denominator of the correct answer) feels counter-intuitive and "wrong" based on their prior years of arithmetic training.
*   **Lack of Estimation:** The student rarely visualizes the problem. If they visualized two-fifths of a cake and one-fifth of a cake, they would see they have three-fifths of a single cake. However, by Year 9, many students move toward "rote algorithms." Because $3 \frac{3}{10}$ looks like a "proper" mixed number and the arithmetic ($1+2$ and $5+5$) is so simple, they would tick the box with high confidence and no suspicion.
