In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), students are moving toward fluency with fractions, but foundational "bugs" regarding the properties of denominators often persist.

### 1. The specific misconception: Denominator Summation
The specific error is **"Adding the Denominators."** This is a specific instance of **Linear Thinking**, where a student treats a fraction not as a single numerical value, but as two independent whole numbers (the "top" number and the "bottom" number) to be operated on using basic addition rules.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would process the mixed numbers as three separate addition problems:
*   **Step 1 (Whole Numbers):** The student adds the integer parts of the mixed numbers. $2 + 1 = 3$. They feel confident because these are whole numbers.
*   **Step 2 (Numerators):** The student moves to the "top" of the fractions and adds them together. $1 + 2 = 3$.
*   **Step 3 (Denominators):** The student treats the "bottom" numbers the same way they treated the top. They see $5$ and $5$ and add them: $5 + 5 = 10$.
*   **Step 4 (Assembly):** The student joins these three results together to form the mixed number $3 \frac{3}{10}$.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This procedure leads directly to **Option D: $3 \frac{3}{10}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is an **extremely attractive and high-frequency error**. 
*   **Logical Consistency:** From the student's perspective, their method is internally consistent. If you add the big numbers and add the top numbers, it feels "fair" and symmetrical to add the bottom numbers. 
*   **Overgeneralization:** Students have been told for years that "what you do to the top, you do to the bottom" (a rule meant for *equivalence*, but frequently misapplied to *addition*).
*   **The "Illusion of Correctness":** Because the student successfully performs three simple additions ($2+1$, $1+2$, $5+5$), they experience a high degree of confidence. They would likely not realize they are wrong because the answer looks like a standard mixed number and "feels" right. Unlike getting a negative number or a massive decimal, $3 \frac{3}{10}$ is close enough to the true value that "common sense" checks rarely trigger an alarm for a Year 9 student.
