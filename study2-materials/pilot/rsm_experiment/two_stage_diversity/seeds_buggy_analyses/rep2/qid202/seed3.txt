In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), students are moving toward fluency with fractions, but foundational "rules" often get conflated.

### 1. The specific misconception: "The Universal Denominator Bug"
This is the **additive property misconception**, where a student correctly applies the logic of whole-number addition to every part of a fraction. Specifically, the student believes that **all** parts of a number (whole numbers, numerators, AND denominators) must be added together.

While students are taught that "you don't add the denominators" when adding fractions, those with this misconception have overgeneralized the concept of "doing the same thing to the top and bottom" or simply succumb to the intuitive pull of adding all visible digits.

### 2. Step-by-step student workflow
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:

1.  **Isolate the parts:** The student sees two mixed numbers and decides to add the "components" separately.
2.  **Add the whole numbers:** They look at the 2 and the 1. They calculate: $2 + 1 = 3$. This forms the whole number part of their answer.
3.  **Add the numerators:** They look at the 1 and the 2 from the fractional parts. They calculate: $1 + 2 = 3$. This becomes their new numerator.
4.  **Add the denominators (The Bug):** They look at the two 5s in the denominators. They believe that since everything else is being added, the denominators must also be totaled. They calculate: $5 + 5 = 10$.
5.  **Assemble the result:** They combine their three totals ($3, 3,$ and $10$) to create the final mixed number: $3 \frac{3}{10}$.

### 3. Corresponding answer option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $3 \frac{3}{10}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the error
This is a highly "natural" and persistent error. A Year 9 student is unlikely to realize they have gone wrong for three main reasons:

*   **Symmetry:** Adding "top + top" and "bottom + bottom" feels mathematically symmetrical and fair. To a student, it feels more logical than the "rule" of keeping the denominator the same, which can seem like an arbitrary exception.
*   **Intuition:** If you have 5 "things" and 5 more "things," a student's basic arithmetic instinct is that you now have 10 "things." They fail to see the denominator as the *size* of the slice (which remains constant) and instead see it as a *count* of objects.
*   **False Positive Reinforcement:** If the student had performed this exact "add everything" logic on a multiplication problem (e.g., $\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{2}{5}$), they would have correctly multiplied the denominators. They often confuse the distinct "no-go" zones of addition rules with the "total" rules of multiplication. 

Because Option D is explicitly listed, the student will feel a sense of **verification**. They see their calculated result reflected in the options, which provides them with a false sense of certainty that their procedural logic was correct.
