In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), while many students are proficient with basic addition, a significant number still struggle with the "rules" of fractions versus the "rules" of integers.

The specific misconception identified here relates to **Option D**.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Denominator Additivity"
The specific bug is known as **"Adding the Across"** or **"Add-All-Numbers Strategy."** The student treats the numerator and the denominator as independent whole numbers rather than a single ratio. Specifically, they believe that the operation (addition) must be applied to every visible component of the fraction.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Process
A student with this misconception would approach the problem using these steps:
1.  **Add the Whole Numbers:** The student sees the 2 and the 1 and adds them together: $2 + 1 = 3$. This part feels correct and reinforces their confidence.
2.  **Add the Numerators:** They look at the fractional parts and add the top numbers: $1 + 2 = 3$.
3.  **Add the Denominators:** Instead of recognizing the denominator as the "name" or "size" of the parts (which stays constant), they apply the addition operation to the bottom numbers: $5 + 5 = 10$.
4.  **Combine:** They assemble these results into a single mixed number: **$3 \frac{3}{10}$**.

### 3. Which Answer Option?
This misconception leads directly to **Option D**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is an **extremely high-frequency error** and is highly "attractive" because it is **logically consistent with other mathematical operations** the student has learned:
*   **Multiplication Consistency:** When multiplying fractions, you *do* multiply the denominators ($ \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2}{25}$). The student incorrectly generalizes this "perform operation on both top and bottom" rule to addition.
*   **Intuitive "Fairness":** To a struggling student, it feels "unfair" or "wrong" to change the top numbers but leave the bottom numbers untouched. They feel they must "do something" to the 5s.
*   **Lack of Estimation:** Because the answer $3 \frac{3}{10}$ looks like a standard mixed number, the student rarely realizes they are wrong. They don't intuitively sense that $3 \frac{3}{10}$ (which is 3.3) is actually *smaller* than the first term $2 \frac{1}{5}$ (which is 2.2) plus something else. Without the "common sense" check that the answer must be larger than 3.4, the procedural "logic" of adding across remains unchallenged.
