In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), while many students are proficient with basic addition, a significant number still struggle with the "rules" of fractions versus the "rules" of integers.

The specific misconception identified here is **The Add-All-Components Bug** (specifically involving the denominators).

### 1. The specific misconception: Denominator Summation
The student treats the fraction part of the mixed number as two independent sets of integers. They correctly identify that the operation is addition, but they apply a "linear" logic: they add the whole numbers together and then add the numerators together **and the denominators together**. 

They fail to understand that the denominator represents the *size* or *name* of the parts (the unit), while the numerator represents the *count*. In their mind, if $1+2=3$ (numerators), then $5+5=10$ (denominators).

### 2. Step-by-step student work
A student with this misconception would process the question in these discrete steps:
1.  **Isolate the Whole Numbers:** "I see a 2 and a 1. $2 + 1 = 3$." (Student records **3**).
2.  **Process the Numerators:** "I see the top numbers are 1 and 2. $1 + 2 = 3$." (Student records **3** as the new numerator).
3.  **Process the Denominators:** "I see the bottom numbers are 5 and 5. $5 + 5 = 10$." (Student records **10** as the new denominator).
4.  **Combine:** The student combines these results to form the mixed number $3 \frac{3}{10}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $3 \frac{3}{10}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness and Naturalness of the Error
This is an **extremely attractive and "logical" error** for a struggling student for several reasons:

*   **Consistency with Whole Numbers:** When we add 25 and 15, we add the units and we add the tens. To a student, adding the "tops" and adding the "bottoms" feels like a consistent application of basic arithmetic.
*   **Pseudo-Logic:** The student often feels they have been "thorough." If they only added the numerators and left the 5 alone, they might feel they "ignored" half of the numbers in the fraction. By adding the 5s to get 10, they feel they have correctly "used" every number provided in the question.
*   **The "Lure" of Choice D:** Because $3 \frac{3}{10}$ appears as a distracter in the multiple-choice list, it provides a "confirmation bias." The student arrives at a result, sees it exactly as they calculated it, and feels a surge of confidence. They are unlikely to realize they are wrong because their procedure was internally consistent and the result was "available."
