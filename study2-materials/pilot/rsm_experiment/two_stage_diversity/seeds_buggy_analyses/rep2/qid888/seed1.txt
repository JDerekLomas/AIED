As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, the specific error I will identify is the **Negative Multiplicative Sign Error (specifically, the product of two negatives).**

### 1. The specific misconception or procedural error
The error is the **"Two minuses make a minus"** bug (or the **Incorrect Sign for the Constant Term**). 

Many students correctly apply the additive rule for directed numbers ($-5 + -7 = -12$) but fail to apply the multiplicative rule when dealing with the constant term ($(-5) \times (-7)$). The student believes that because the equation is "full of minuses," the final numerical result must also be negative. They fail to internalize that multiplying two negative numbers produces a positive result.

### 2. How a student with this misconception would work through the question
The student likely uses the **FOIL** (First, Outside, Inside, Last) method or a grid method:

1.  **First:** $m \times m = m^2$. (Correct)
2.  **Outside:** $m \times (-7) = -7m$. (Correct)
3.  **Inside:** $(-5) \times m = -5m$. (Correct)
4.  **Simplify middle terms:** They combine $-7m - 5m$ to get **$-12m$**. (Correct)
5.  **Last:** This is where the error occurs. The student multiplies $5 \times 7$ to get $35$, but looks at the signs in the brackets $(m-5)$ and $(m-7)$. Thinking that "negative times a negative stays negative" or simply carrying the "minus" theme forward, they write **$-35$**.

The student assembles the pieces to get: $m^2 - 12m - 35$.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $m^2 - 12m - 35$.**

### 4. How natural/attractive this error is
This is one of the most common "distractor" errors in KS3 and KS4 algebra for several reasons:

*   **Linguistic Confusion:** Students often hear the "rule" as *"Two minuses make a plus."* They may apply this to $-5 - 7$ and mistakenly get $+12m$, or they may get "sign fatigue" and simply assume a problem involving subtractions should end in a subtraction.
*   **Intuition vs. Rules:** Intuitively, if you take a negative amount and multiply it, it feels like it should become "more negative." The concept of a positive product from two negative factors is abstract and frequently forgotten under exam pressure.
*   **The "Natural" Feel:** Because the student successfully simplified the middle term to $-12m$ (which is negative), finishing the expression with $-35$ feels "consistent" to them.
*   **Self-Correction:** A student would **not** realize they were wrong. Because they performed the multiplication ($5 \times 7 = 35$) and the addition ($5 + 7 = 12$) correctly, they feel a sense of procedural success. They would likely view Option B as the "trick" answer designed to catch people who forgot that the original signs were negative.
