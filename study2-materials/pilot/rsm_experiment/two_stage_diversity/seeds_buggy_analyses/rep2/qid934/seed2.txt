In this context, the student is being asked to find the $y$-intercept of the linear equation $4x + 2y = 10$.

### 1. The specific misconception: "The Operator Displacement Bug"
The specific misconception is **The Operator Displacement Bug** (also known as a "balancing error" or "selective substitution"). In this error, the student identifies the two constants on the left side of the equation ($4$ and $2$) and incorrectly assumes they must "combine" them with the right-hand side using the visible operators, regardless of the variable they are solving for. 

Specifically, the student fails to treat the equation as a balance and instead sees it as a sequence of numbers. They decide to "move" the 4 and the 2 over to the 10 using addition because the plus sign is the most prominent feature in the expression.

### 2. The Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would work as follows:
*   **Step 1:** Look at the table and see $x=0$. Correct identify that they need to find the value of $y$ when $x=0$.
*   **Step 2:** Mentally "block out" the $4x$ term since $x$ is $0$. This leaves them with $2y = 10$ (or just the numbers $4, 2,$ and $10$).
*   **Step 3:** Instead of dividing 10 by 2, the student misinterprets the structure of the equation. They see the numbers $4$, $2$, and $10$ and assume they need to "gather" the numbers together. 
*   **Step 4:** They perform the operation $10 + 4 + 2$ or they interpret the $2y = 10$ as a prompt to "add 10 and the coefficient of $y$ together."
*   **Step 5:** Alternatively, and very commonly at Year 9, the student calculates $4 + 2 \times 0$ (incorrectly substituting $y$ for $x$) then adds $10$ plus the remaining coefficients: $10 + 4 + 6 = 20$.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads to **Answer A (20)**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the error
This error is **highly attractive** for three reasons:
1.  **Additive Preference:** Students who are shaky with algebraic manipulation often default to addition as the "easiest" operation.
2.  **Number Scavenging:** When a student is overwhelmed by an equation in the form $ax + by = c$, they often "scavenge" for all the numbers they can see $(4, 2, 10)$ and perform a simple operation to combine them. $4 + 2 + 10$ feels "complete" and results in a clean, round number ($16$), which they then "correct" upward to 20 if they feel the answer should be higher. 
3.  **Substitution Confusion:** Many students confuse the position of $x$ and $y$. If they mistakenly think the star is $x$ and $y=0$, they calculate $4x = 10$. Finding $2.5$ (Option D) and "doubling it" because of the coefficient 2 leads them straight to 20.

The student would **not** realize they had gone wrong. Because 20 is a whole number and is provided as Option A, it carries the "authority of the multiple choice." The student feels a sense of success for using all the numbers provided in the prompt.
