In this scenario, a Year 9 student is most likely to commit the **Variable Switching** error (specifically, substituting the value for the wrong variable).

### 1. The specific misconception: Variable Switching (or "Substitution Confusion")
The student understands that they must "put the number into the equation," but they fail to map the column header ($x$) to the correct algebraic symbol in the equation ($4x$). Instead of substituting $0$ for $x$, they substitute it for $y$, often because $y$ is the variable they are "trying to find" or simply due to a lack of attention to the structure of the coordinate pair.

### 2. Step-by-step procedure
*   **Step 1:** Look at the table and see that when $x = 0$, the $y$ value (the star) needs to be found.
*   **Step 2:** Look at the equation $4x + 2y = 10$.
*   **Step 3:** Instead of replacing $x$, the student replaces the "unknown" part or mistakenly swaps the roles: they set $y = 0$.
*   **Step 4:** They write down the new equation: $4x + 2(0) = 10$.
*   **Step 5:** This simplifies to $4x = 10$.
*   **Step 6:** They solve for $x$ by calculating $10 \div 4 = 2.5$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option D (2.5)**.

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This error is highly "attractive" and notoriously common for three reasons:

*   **Intercept Confusion:** In Year 9, students are learning about $x$ and $y$ intercepts. They often memorize that "to find an intercept, you set something to zero." They may have internalized a "procedure" to solve for the "other" letter without checking which one is actually provided in the table.
*   **Ease of Calculation:** $10 \div 4 = 2.5$ feels like a "maths-y" result. It is just challenging enough to feel correct, but simple enough to perform.
*   **Plausibility:** Because $2.5$ is a decimal and $5$ (the correct answer) is an integer, a student might actually feel *more* confident in $2.5$. Many students at this level believe that if a calculation involves a division that isn't a whole number, they must be doing "real" algebra. 

The student would likely **not** realize they went wrong because $2.5$ appears as a distractor. To them, seeing their exact result in the multiple-choice list serves as a "confirmation bias" that their logic was sound.
