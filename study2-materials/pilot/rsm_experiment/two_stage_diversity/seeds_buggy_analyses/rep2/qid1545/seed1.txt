As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I identify the most likely error for a UK Year 9 student (age 13–14) as the **"Left-to-Right Processing" bug**, specifically the failure to apply the priority of division over addition.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The "PEMDAS/BIDMAS is Optional" Bug
While Year 9 students have been taught BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction), many retain a "primitive" procedural bug where they treat mathematical expressions like a sentence in English: **reading and calculating strictly from left to right.** In this bug, the student ignores the hierarchical nature of operators and treats the plus sign as the first command simply because it appears first spatially.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would process the expression as follows:

**Step 1: Process the left side**
*   They see $8 + 12 \div 4$.
*   Ignoring the rule that division comes before addition, they calculate $8 + 12 = 20$.
*   They then take that result and divide by $4$: $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.

**Step 2: Process the right side**
*   They see $(8 + 12) \div 4$.
*   Even though they might recognize the brackets, the result is the same as their previous "left-to-right" logic.
*   They calculate $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.

**Step 3: Comparison**
*   The student concludes that both sides equal $5$.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option C ($=$)**. 

*(Note: The correct mathematical path is $8 + 3 = 11$ on the left and $20 \div 4 = 5$ on the right, making the correct answer A ($>$)).*

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive and "invisible" to the student** for several reasons:

*   **Computational Symmetry:** Because the numbers used are identical ($8, 12, 4$), the student feels a sense of cognitive ease. The fact that they get the same result ($5$) for both sides feels like a "validation" of their method rather than a warning sign.
*   **The "Brackets are Redundant" Bias:** A student struggling with BIDMAS often views brackets as "suggestions" or decorative elements. If their left-to-right method already yields the result they think the brackets are asking for, they will assume the brackets are simply there to clarify the left-to-right order, not to change it.
*   **Intuition over Rule-Following:** At this age, under time pressure or in low-stakes practice, the brain defaults to the "path of least resistance." Left-to-right reading is a more deeply ingrained neural pathway than the abstract hierarchy of operations, making it feel more "natural." 

The student would likely move on to the next question with high confidence, never realizing they bypassed a fundamental rule of algebraic priority.
