As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a primary error common among UK Year 9 students (approx. 13–14 years old) for this specific problem.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Left-to-Right Processing" (Order of Operations Neglect)
The specific bug is **Left-to-Right Processing**, often colloquially called "ignoring BIDMAS/order of precedence." The student treats the expression as a chain of events, calculating operations in the order they appear from left to right, rather than prioritizing division over addition.

### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:

**Left-hand side (8 + 12 ÷ 4):**
1.  **Step 1:** Look at the first operation ($8 + 12$) and calculate it immediately. Result: **20**.
2.  **Step 2:** Take that result and apply the next operation ($20 \div 4$).
3.  **Result:** **5**.
*(The student has failed to see that $12 \div 4$ should be calculated first according to the Order of Operations/BIDMAS.)*

**Right-hand side ((8 + 12) ÷ 4):**
1.  **Step 1:** Look inside the brackets (or simply work left to right, as the brackets happen to align with a left-to-right flow). Calculate $8 + 12$. Result: **20**.
2.  **Step 2:** Divide the result by 4 ($20 \div 4$).
3.  **Result:** **5**.

**Comparison:**
The student compares their calculated value of **5** for the left side with their calculated value of **5** for the right side.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads the student to **Option C ($=$)**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and feels "natural" for several reasons:

*   **Linguistic Mapping:** We read from left to right. To many students, a mathematical expression is a sentence where verbs (operations) are performed as they are encountered.
*   **Cognitive Ease:** Adding 8 and 12 results in a "nice" number (20) which is perfectly divisible by 4. The numbers in this question have been chosen (likely as a "distractor") to reward the incorrect order of operations with whole-number integers, reinforcing the student's belief that they are on the right track.
*   **False Symmetry:** The student sees the same numbers ($8, 12, 4$) in the same order. To an untrained eye, the brackets on the right side look like "optional" or "clarifying" markers rather than structural instructions that change the meaning of the expression.

Because both sides result in the same integer (5), the student experiences **internal validation**. They would likely feel very confident in their answer and have no reason to suspect they have made a procedural error.
