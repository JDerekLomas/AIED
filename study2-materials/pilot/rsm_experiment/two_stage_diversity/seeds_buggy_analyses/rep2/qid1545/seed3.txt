As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a primary error common among UK Year 9 students (typically 13–14 years old). By this stage, students are familiar with **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction), but many suffer from a "linear processing" habit.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The "Left-to-Right" Procedural Bug
The specific misconception is **Operator Precedence Neglect (Linearity Bias)**. The student treats the mathematical expression like a sentence in English, reading and calculating strictly from left to right, ignoring the priority of division over addition. This is often triggered by the physical layout of the numbers rather than a lack of knowing what the BIDMAS acronym stands for.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Work-through
A student with this misconception would process the two sides of the box as follows:

**Left Hand Side (8 + 12 ÷ 4):**
1.  The student reads "8 + 12" first.
2.  They perform the addition: $8 + 12 = 20$.
3.  They then take that result and divide by 4: $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.
*(Crucially, they ignore that BIDMAS dictates 12 ÷ 4 must happen first.)*

**Right Hand Side ( (8 + 12) ÷ 4 ):**
1.  The student sees the brackets. Even with a linear bias, they know brackets take priority.
2.  They perform the addition inside: $8 + 12 = 20$.
3.  They divide by 4: $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.

**Comparison:**
The student concludes that $5 \square 5$.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads the student to select **C) =**.

*(The correct mathematical working is $8 + 3 = 11$ on the left and $20 \div 4 = 5$ on the right, leading to $11 > 5$, which is option A).*

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and often feels "correct" to the student because of the internal consistency of their results. 

*   **The "Trap of Consistency":** When the student calculates both sides and gets the same answer (5), it provides a false sense of validation. They feel they have "proven" the answer through two separate calculations. 
*   **Aesthetic Symmetry:** To a Year 9 student, the right-hand side often looks like a "formalized" version of the left-hand side. They might view the brackets as "extra information" that doesn't change the numbers involved, leading them to believe the two expressions are mathematically identical.
*   **Lack of Conflict:** Because the student is not prompted to check their order of operations, and the numbers "divide nicely" ($20 \div 4 = 5$), there is no cognitive dissonance (like a messy decimal) to signal that they have performed the operations in the wrong order. They would likely finish the question with high confidence, never realizing they bypassed the division rule.
