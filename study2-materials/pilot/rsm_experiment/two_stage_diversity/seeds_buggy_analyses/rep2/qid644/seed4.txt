As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent "buggy procedure" that frequently occurs when students transition from arithmetic to algebraic manipulation.

### 1. The Misconception: The "Operator-to-Operation" Confusion (Additive Bug)
The specific misconception here is **Operation Substitution** (specifically, adding instead of multiplying). 

In the context of expanding brackets, the student correctly identifies the two terms indicated by the arrows ($-1$ and $-4$) but fails to apply the distributive law, which requires **multiplication**. Instead, they see two signed numbers placed near each other and default to **addition** (combining the terms). They interpret the task of "combining" the constants as a sum rather than a product.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Logic
A student with this misconception would process the question as follows:
*   **Step 1:** Look at the arrows and identify the two numerical values involved: $-1$ and $-4$.
*   **Step 2:** Note that the goal is to find the result of these two terms being "joined" or "put together" as part of the expansion.
*   **Step 3:** Instead of multiplying ($-1 \times -4$), the student mentally performs an addition: "I have minus one, and I subtract another four" or "Negative one plus negative four."
*   **Step 4:** They calculate $-1 - 4 = -5$.

### 3. Selection
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $-5$**.

*(Note: Option C (+5) would represent a secondary misconception where the student adds the absolute values but assumes "two negatives make a positive" applies to addition as well as multiplication.)*

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This is an **extremely attractive error** for a Year 9 student, often termed a "low-road" cognitive slip. 

*   **Fluency vs. Concept:** By Year 9, students are often so focused on the "FOIL" or "Grid" procedure that they lose sight of the fact that brackets signify multiplication. 
*   **Linguistic Ambiguity:** The teacher may say, "Now we do the last terms, negative one and negative four." To a struggling student, "and" is linguistically synonymous with addition.
*   **Metacognition:** The student is **highly unlikely to realize they went wrong.** The number "5" feels "correct" because it is a result of $1$ and $4$. Because $-5$ is listed as an option, it provides "distractor validation"—the presence of the answer in the list confirms their faulty logic, and they will move on to the next question with total confidence.
