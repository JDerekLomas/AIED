As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent "bug" that affects students transitioning from arithmetic to algebra.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The "Operation Confusion" Bug
The specific error is **Additive instead of Multiplicative processing**.

When students see brackets, they are taught they are "expanding." However, because the terms are constants (numbers without variables), many students default to the most basic relationship between two numbers: addition or subtraction. Instead of performing the correct operation (**multiplication**), the student performs **addition**, treating the expansion as a simple arithmetic combination of two signed numbers.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Thinking
A student with this misconception would approach the arrows as follows:

*   **Step 1:** Look at the first indicated term: $-1$.
*   **Step 2:** Look at the second indicated term: $-4$.
*   **Step 3:** Instead of multiplying ($(-1) \times (-4)$), the student thinks: "I have minus one and then minus four more."
*   **Step 4:** They calculate $-1 - 4$ or "add" the two negative values together.
*   **Step 5:** They conclude that $-1$ and $-4$ combined results in $-5$.

### 3. Answer Choice
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: -5**.

*(Note: Option C (+5) would be chosen by a student with the same "Additive" bug who also suffers from a "Sign Change" bug, erroneously thinking that two negatives always make a positive regardless of the operation).*

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly natural and extremely seductive** for a Year 9 student for three reasons:

1.  **Cognitive Load:** Expanding brackets (FOIL/Grid method) requires managing four different multiplications and their signs. When students focus on the signs, their working memory "glitches," and they revert to the most basic number-line logic (moving left from -1 by 4 units).
2.  **Language Interference:** In English, "Minus one and minus four" sounds like an addition problem ($ -1 + -4$). Students often interpret "combining" the terms in the brackets as finding the sum.
3.  **The "Invisible" Operator:** Unlike $2 \times 3$, there is no multiplication symbol between the $-1$ and the $-4$. To a student struggling with the abstract nature of algebra, the absence of an operator makes it easy to substitute the "default" operation of addition.

**Would they realize they were wrong?** Almost certainly not. Because $-5$ is a provided option, it provides **False Validation**. The student feels a sense of confidence because their calculated result matches one of the choices, confirming their incorrect "Addition" logic as a valid strategy.
