As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent "buggy procedure" that frequently occurs when students transition from arithmetic to algebraic manipulation.

### 1. The Misconception: The "Operator Overload" Bug (Addition instead of Multiplication)
The specific misconception is **confusing the operation of binomial expansion (multiplication) with simple combination (addition)**. 

Even though students are told that expanding brackets requires "multiplying everything in the first bracket by everything in the second," their brains often default to the most basic relationship between two signed numbers when they are "put together." Instead of performing the operation required by the context of the algebraic brackets ($a \times b$), they perform a mental addition ($a + b$).

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Working
A student with this misconception would look at the terms indicated by the arrows and follow these steps:

1.  **Identify the values:** The student correctly identifies the two terms as $-1$ and $-4$, recognizing that the minus signs belong to the numbers (an important but separate skill).
2.  **Determine the operation:** Instead of recognizing the brackets imply multiplication, the student thinks: "I have minus one and minus four. What happens when I put them together?"
3.  **Perform the calculation:** They use an internal number line or "money" analogy: *"I am at -1 and I go down 4 more"* or *"I owe £1 and then I owe another £4."*
4.  **Result:** They conclude that $-1 - 4 = -5$.

### 3. Answer Choice
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $-5$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is a **highly natural and "sticky" error** for several reasons:

*   **Linguistic Cues:** When a teacher says, "Now do the -1 and the -4," the word "and" is linguistically ambiguous. In everyday English, "and" implies addition ($1 \text{ and } 4 \text{ is } 5$).
*   **Cognitive Load:** Expanding a binomial involves four separate multiplications and usually a final addition step (collecting like terms). Under the pressure of managing variables like $p$, the student's brain may "downgrade" the arithmetic of the constants to the simplest possible operation (addition) to save mental energy.
*   **Lack of Feedback:** Unlike other errors, the student will **not** realize they have gone wrong. Because $-1 - 4$ is a "correct" sum in its own right, the student feels a sense of mathematical certainty. They see their result ($-5$) as an option on the multiple-choice list, which reinforces their confidence that they applied the correct rule.
