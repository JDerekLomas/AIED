As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific error that frequently occurs in UK Year 9 classrooms during algebra units.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The "Operation Confusion" Bug
The specific error is **Additive instead of Multiplicative Processing.** 

This occurs when a student knows they need to "combine" the two numbers identified by the FOIL (First, Outside, Inside, Last) or "Claw" method, but they revert to **integer addition** instead of **integer multiplication**. Even though the instruction for expanding brackets is to multiply, the visual proximity of two integers can trigger the more basic arithmetic script of "finding the total."

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Logic
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:
1.  **Identify the terms:** The student looks at the arrows and correctly identifies the two terms as $-1$ and $-4$. 
2.  **Select the operation:** Instead of thinking "negative one times negative four," their brain processes the relationship as "a negative one and a negative four put together."
3.  **Perform the calculation:** The student calculates $-1 + (-4)$. They might think: "I am at minus 1 and I go down 4 more," or "One negative plus four negatives makes five negatives."
4.  **Conclude:** They decide the result is $-5$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: -5**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive and "natural"** for several reasons:

*   **Cognitive Load:** Expanding brackets involves several steps (distributing $2p$, then distributing $-1$). Under the "heavy lifting" of algebra, students often default to lower-level arithmetic errors because their working memory is full. 
*   **The "Double Negative" Trap:** Students often have a half-remembered rule that "two negatives make a plus." When they see $-1$ and $-4$, they might be trying to avoid making that mistake by being "extra careful" with the negative signs, leading them to simply group them together.
*   **Invisible Operators:** In the expression $(2p-1)(3p-4)$, there is no multiplication sign $(\times)$ visible. For a student struggling with fluency, the absence of a multiplication sign makes it easier to accidentally apply an additive process.

**Would the student realize they went wrong?** No. To the student, $-5$ feels like a "strong" answer because it correctly applies the rules of directed number addition. They would likely feel confident that they have correctly handled the signs and the values, unaware they used the wrong operator entirely.
