As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent "bug" that affects students transitioning from arithmetic to algebra.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: The "Operation Confusion" Bug
The specific error is **Additive instead of Multiplicative Processing**. This occurs when a student focuses on the *symbols* (the numbers and their signs) but defaults to addition or subtraction rather than the multiplication required by the distributive law (expanding brackets). In their mind, they are "combining" the terms rather than finding their product.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Thinking
A student with this misconception would approach the arrows in the following way:
*   **Step 1 (Identification):** The student identifies the two terms indicated: $-1$ and $-4$.
*   **Step 2 (Execution of the Bug):** Instead of multiplying $-1 \times -4$, the student’s brain processes the relationship between these numbers as an addition/summation task. They think, "I have negative one and negative four."
*   **Step 3 (Mental Calculation):** They calculate $-1 - 4$. They may visualize a number line (starting at $-1$ and moving left 4) or use the logic of "one debt added to another debt."
*   **Step 4 (Final Result):** They conclude that $-1$ and $-4$ combined results in $-5$.

### 3. Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $-5$**.

### 4. Naturalness and Attractiveness
This error is **highly attractive** and one of the most common mistakes in Year 9 algebra. 

*   **Linguistic Trigger:** Teachers often use the phrase "put the numbers together" or "combine them" when referring to terms. For a student, $-1$ and $-4$ "put together" logically feels like $-5$.
*   **Lack of Feedback:** Because $-5$ is a listed option (D), the student feels a surge of confidence (the "Confirmation Bias" effect). They see their calculated result reflected in the options, which validates their incorrect process.
*   **Realization:** The student would **not** realize they were wrong. Unlike a mistake that leads to a "messy" decimal or an answer not on the list, this feels "clean" and logical. They are incorrectly applying "integer arithmetic" rules in a context that requires "multiplicative expansion," a subtle but fundamental distinction in the secondary curriculum.
