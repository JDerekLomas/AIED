As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I identify the following "buggy procedure" frequently seen in UK Year 9 classrooms.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Operation-Operand Blindness" (Commutative Division Error)
The specific misconception is the belief that **division is commutative** (that $a \div b$ is the same as $b \div a$), or more specifically, the **"Large-Divided-By-Small" Bug**. 

When students see a fraction and an integer, they often intuitively divide the larger number by the smaller number regardless of their positions as numerator or denominator. They ignore the algebraic structure (where $p$ is the divisor) and focus on the numbers available.

### 2. The Step-by-Step "Buggy" Working
A student with this misconception would approach the equation $10 = \frac{5}{p}$ as follows:

1.  **Isolate the variable:** The student recognizes they need to do "something" with the 10 and the 5 to find $p$.
2.  **Recognition of Operation:** They see the fraction bar and correctly identify that the operation required is division.
3.  **The Error:** Instead of multiplying both sides by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, the student looks at the numbers 10 and 5 and instinctively performs the "easier" or "more natural" division. 
4.  **The Calculation:** They calculate $10 \div 5$.
5.  **Conclusion:** They decide that $p = 2$.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option C ($p = 2$)**.

### 4. How Natural/Attractive is this Error?
This is an **extremely attractive "trap"** for Year 9 students for several reasons:

*   **Ease of Calculation:** $10 \div 5 = 2$ is a "clean" number bond learned in primary school. Students have a cognitive bias toward whole-number results; $0.5$ (the correct answer) feels "small" and "wrong" as a solution to an equation involving 5 and 10.
*   **The "Equation Balance" Myth:** Students often subconsciously think, "What do I do to 5 and 10 to get an answer?" Since $5 \div 10$ is difficult or results in a decimal, they flip it to $10 \div 5$.
*   **Lack of Verification:** The student is very unlikely to realize they went wrong. If they "check" their work, they might plug the numbers back in and see $10, 5,$ and $2$, thinking, "Yes, those three numbers definitely go together," without checking the actual position of the divisor. Because 2, 5, and 10 form a familiar "fact family," the answer $p=2$ feels intuitively "correct" even though it is algebraically backwards ($5 \div 2 \neq 10$).
