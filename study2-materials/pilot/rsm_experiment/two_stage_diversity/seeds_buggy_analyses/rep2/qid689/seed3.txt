As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent issue for UK Year 9 students known as **The Inverse Operation Over-generalisation** (specifically involving the "Variable as a Denominator" bug).

### 1. The specific misconception: "Operation Commutativity Error"
The student mistakenly believes that division is commutative (that $a \div b$ is the same as $b \div a$) or follows a rigid "bigger number divided by smaller number" rule. When they see a fraction, they do not treat $p$ as a divisor that needs to be "multiplied out"; instead, they simply see two numbers and an operation, assuming they should divide the constant by the numerator regardless of where the variable is.

### 2. The step-by-step working
A student with this misconception would approach the equation $10 = \frac{5}{p}$ as follows:
*   **Step 1:** The student recognizes they need to "solve for $p$," which usually involves isolating the variable using division or multiplication.
*   **Step 2:** They see the numbers $10$ and $5$. They ignore the fact that $p$ is in the denominator. 
*   **Step 3:** They think: "To find $p$, I just need to divide the numbers I see." They perform $10 \div 5$.
*   **Step 4:** They calculate $10 \div 5 = 2$ and conclude that $p = 2$.

### 3. The corresponding answer option
This misconception leads directly to **Option C) $p = 2$**.

### 4. How attractive is this error?
This error is **extremely natural and highly seductive** for a Year 9 student for several reasons:

*   **Ease of Calculation:** $10 \div 5$ results in a clean, whole integer ($2$). In many lower-secondary maths problems, "nice" numbers act as a false confirmation that the method is correct. 
*   **Cognitive Load:** Correctly solving for a variable in the denominator requires two steps (multiplying by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, then dividing by $10$). Students often look for a "one-step" shortcut to reduce cognitive effort.
*   **Fluency vs. Concept:** The student is likely confusing this with the equation $10 = \frac{p}{5}$ (where the answer is 50) or $10 = 5p$ (where they would divide). Because they are used to "dividing to solve," they apply the action without respecting the structure of the fraction.
*   **Lack of Verification:** The student is unlikely to realize they are wrong because they rarely "check" their work by substituting the answer back in. If they did, they would see that $5 \div 2$ is $2.5$, not $10$, but the instinct to "calculate and move on" is very strong at this age.
