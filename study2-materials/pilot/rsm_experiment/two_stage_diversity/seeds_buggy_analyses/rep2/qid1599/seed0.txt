As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a specific error that frequently occurs when Year 9 students transition from arithmetic notation to formal algebraic fractions.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Order of Operations Dissociation" (Specifically, the Term-by-Term Bug)
This misconception occurs when a student treats a division bar not as a grouping mechanism (a vinculum), but as a direct replacement for the $\div$ symbol applied only to the term immediately preceding and following it. They fail to recognise that in the expression $c \div (h+4)$, the parentheses dictate that the entire sum $(h+4)$ is the divisor. Instead, they apply the division to $h$ and "append" the $+4$ as a separate entity.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Reasoning
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:
*   **Step 1:** Look at the expression $c \div (h+4)$.
*   **Step 2:** See the division symbol and identify that "algebra uses fractions instead of $\div$ signs."
*   **Step 3:** Interpret the calculation "linearly" from left to right: "First I have $c$, then I divide it by $h$."
*   **Step 4:** Translate that specific part into a fraction: $\frac{c}{h}$.
*   **Step 5:** See the $+4$ and assume it remains an independent term at the end of the expression because they have "already dealt with" the division part. 
*   **Step 6:** Combine them to get $\frac{c}{h} + 4$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option C: $\frac{c}{h}+4$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is a highly "natural" error for a Year 9 student for several reasons:

*   **Linear Reading:** Students are taught from primary school to read mathematical operations from left to right. Option C preserves the "visual flow" of the original expression ($c$ then $h$ then $4$) more closely than Option A.
*   **Parentheses Fatigue:** Many students view parentheses merely as "decorations" that signal "do this first" in arithmetic. When they move to algebra, they often believe that by turning the division into a fraction, they have "cleared" the operation and the parentheses are no longer relevant.
*   **Overconfidence:** A student making this error would **not realise they were wrong.** To them, Option C looks more sophisticated than Option A; it looks like "solved" algebra, whereas Option A looks like the question has just been rearranged. They feel they have successfully applied the rule "fractions mean division" without understanding that the fraction bar also acts as a grouping symbol.
