As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I identify the following buggy procedure for this Year 9 question:

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Top-Heavy Division Bias" (Operand Swap)
The specific error is a **Directionality Misconception**, specifically a **Dividend/Divisor Swap**. 

In primary education, students are frequently taught that "you cannot divide a small number by a large number" (a rule that is later debunked). This creates a mental "fix-it" heuristic where the student assumes the more "complex" or "larger" expression should be the dividend (the top of the fraction), regardless of the order in the horizontal equation. Additionally, because algebraic fractions are often used to solve for variables (e.g., $2x = 6$), students are used to seeing the variable on the top and a simpler term on the bottom, or they may simply read the operation from right to left based on the visual "weight" of the expression.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would process the question as follows:
*   **Step 1:** The student identifies the two components of the calculation: the single variable $c$ and the binomial expression $(h+4)$.
*   **Step 2:** They recognise that the $\div$ symbol indicates a fraction bar (the horizontal vinculum).
*   **Step 3:** The student looks at the expression and subconsciously evaluates the "complexity" or "size." They see $(h+4)$ as the more significant part of the problem.
*   **Step 4:** They erroneously apply a "Largest/Most Complex goes on top" rule, placing $(h+4)$ in the numerator and $c$ in the denominator to make the fraction look "correct" or "familiar."

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $\frac{h+4}{c}$**.

### 4. Naturalness and Attractiveness
This is a highly "invisible" error for a Year 9 student. They would likely feel **very confident** in their choice and would not realize they had made a mistake.

**Why it is so attractive:**
*   **Reading Directionality:** In English, we read left-to-right. However, when students begin rearranging formulas (e.g., $A = bh$, so $h = \frac{A}{b}$), they become accustomed to moving terms from one side to another. This often results in a loss of "order discipline," where they stop respecting the fact that the first term in a division (the dividend) *must* become the numerator.
*   **Visual Balance:** To an untrained eye, Option A looks "precarious" because a single letter is balancing on a longer expression. Option D looks "stable" (a wide top on a narrow base), which aligns with how many introductory fractions look (e.g., $\frac{10}{2}$ or $\frac{x}{2}$).
*   **Cognitive Load:** When a student sees brackets/parentheses, they focus on "keeping them together." By the time they have processed $(h+4)$, they may have mentally placed it at the start of their conceptual workspace, leading them to write it down first at the top of the fraction.
