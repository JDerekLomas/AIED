In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (ages 13–14), where students are transitionally moving from basic arithmetic to algebraic manipulation involving fractions, the following misconception is highly common.

### 1. The Misconception: "Inverse Operation by Multiplicative Intuition"
This is a specific procedural "bug" where a student identifies the correct inverse operation (division) but mistakenly applies the inverse property to the **denominator** of the existing fraction rather than the **entire value**. 

In their mental model, "dividing a fraction by a whole number" is conflated with "dividing the denominator by that number" because they see $12 \div 3 = 4$ as a "cleaner" and more intuitive path than multiplication.

### 2. The Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:

1.  **Identify the goal:** They correctly recognize they need to isolate $p$ by removing the $3$.
2.  **Identify the inverse:** They know that because $3$ is multiplying $p$, they must divide by $3$.
3.  **The Error Step:** Instead of performing $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$ (which involves multiplying the denominator), the student looks at the fraction $\frac{1}{12}$ and "shares" the denominator by the coefficient. They calculate $12 \div 3 = 4$.
4.  **The Result:** They replace the denominator $12$ with the result of the division ($4$), maintaining the structure of the fraction.
5.  **Final Equation:** $p = \frac{1}{4}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: \( p = \frac{1}{4} \)**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and often feels "more right" to a student than the correct method for several reasons:

*   **Numerical Comfort:** Students have a natural bias toward "integer-friendly" results. Dividing 12 by 3 yields a tidy integer (4), whereas the correct operation ($12 \times 3 = 36$) yields a larger, less "obvious" denominator.
*   **The "Sharing" Metaphor:** Students often visualize division as breaking something into smaller pieces. In their mind, "dividing a twelfth" should result in something involving a "fourth," failing to realize that $\frac{1}{4}$ is actually *larger* than $\frac{1}{12}$.
*   **Lack of Reality Check:** Most Year 9 students do not automatically substitute their answer back into the equation. If they did ($3 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$), they would see it does not equal $\frac{1}{12}$. However, without that habit, $\frac{1}{4}$ appears mathematically elegant and "correct-looking," leading the student to be quite confident in their choice.
