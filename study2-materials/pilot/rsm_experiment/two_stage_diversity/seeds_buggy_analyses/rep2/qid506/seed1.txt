In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (GCSE Foundation level), the most prevalent misconception for this specific problem is the **"Inverse Operation Neglect"** combined with a **"Fraction Multiplication Bug."**

### 1. The specific misconception: The "Implicit Multiplier" Error
The student correctly identifies that they need to "move" the 3 to the other side of the equation. However, because the right-hand side is a fraction, the student undergoes a cognitive overload. Instead of dividing by 3 (the inverse of multiplying), they apply the 3 as a multiplier to the **denominator** only, but mistake the operation as a simplification or a direct multiplication of the visible integers ($3 \times 4$ logic). 

More specifically, the student performs **$12 \div 3$** instead of $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$. This is a "procedural bypass" where the student ignores the fraction structure and simply performs the operation that feels most "natural" with the two integers visible in the denominator area and the coefficient.

### 2. Step-by-step student work
*   **Step 1:** The student looks at $3p = \frac{1}{12}$ and knows they must "get $p$ on its own."
*   **Step 2:** They identify the numbers $3$ and $12$. They think: *"I need to get 3 to the other side. 12 divided by 3 is 4."*
*   **Step 3:** They keep the structure of the fraction but replace the 12 with the result of their division. 
*   **Step 4:** They write $p = \frac{1}{4}$.

### 3. The resulting answer
This misconception leads directly to **Option A ($p = \frac{1}{4}$)**.

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This error is **highly attractive** and one of the most common "distractor" traps in KS3/KS4 algebra for several reasons:

*   **The "Clean Number" Bias:** $12 \div 3 = 4$ is a "clean" number sentence that students have known since primary school. Their brain prioritizes this familiar calculation over the more complex $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$.
*   **Misinterpreted Inverse:** The student knows $3p$ means "multiply by 3," so they know they must "divide." However, they see the 12 in the denominator (which is already a division) and conclude that dividing the denominator by 3 is the correct path.
*   **Lack of Magnitude Check:** A Year 9 student rarely performs a "sanity check." If they did, they would realize that if 3 of something equals a tiny sliver ($\frac{1}{12}$), then one of them ($p$) must be even smaller. However, $\frac{1}{4}$ is *larger* than $\frac{1}{12}$. Because $\frac{1}{4}$ "looks" like a sensible fraction, the student will feel confident and will not realize they have actually tripled the value instead of dividing it.
