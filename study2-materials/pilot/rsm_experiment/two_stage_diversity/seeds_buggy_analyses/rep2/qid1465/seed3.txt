In the context of the UK Year 9 curriculum, a student should be proficient in the order of operations (BIDMAS: Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). However, a specific and persistent procedural error exists regarding the hierarchy of addition and subtraction.

### 1. The specific misconception: The "Strict Addition Before Subtraction" Bug
The misconception is the belief that the "A" (Addition) in BIDMAS **must** be performed before the "S" (Subtraction) in all circumstances. While students know multiplication comes before addition, they often fail to realize that Addition and Subtraction have **equal priority** and should be worked from left to right. This is often reinforced by the mnemonic itself, where A precedes S.

### 2. The step-by-step procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the expression $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$ as follows:

1.  **Multiplication first:** They correctly identify that multiplication precedes addition and subtraction. They calculate $4 \times 2 = 8$. The expression is now $3 - 5 + 8$.
2.  **Rigid Addition:** Looking at the "A" before "S" in BIDMAS, they feel compelled to resolve the addition operation before the subtraction. They group the $5$ and $8$ together: $5 + 8 = 13$.
3.  **Subtraction last:** They then bring down the $3$ and the subtraction sign to complete the calculation: $3 - 13$.
4.  **Final Result:** $3 - 13 = -10$.

*(Note: The correct left-to-right method would be: $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 8 = 6$)*.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads directly to **Option D (-10)**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the error
This is a highly "attractive" and "natural" error for three reasons:

*   **Linguistic reinforcement:** Teachers and textbooks emphasize the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS constantly. A student who is trying to be "diligent" will follow the letters literally. To them, skipping to "S" before "A" feels like breaking a mathematical law.
*   **Avoidance of negatives:** Working left to right involves calculating $3 - 5 = -2$. Many Year 9 students have a subconscious aversion to starting a calculation with a negative number. Adding $5 + 8$ first allows them to deal with "easy" positive integers for longer.
*   **False confidence:** Because the student is actively using a named mathematical strategy (BIDMAS), they are unlikely to realize they are wrong. They will see $-10$ as a possible answer, which confirms their "correct" application of the rule. They would likely be surprised to learn that addition and subtraction are "commutative cousins" that should be handled left-to-right.
