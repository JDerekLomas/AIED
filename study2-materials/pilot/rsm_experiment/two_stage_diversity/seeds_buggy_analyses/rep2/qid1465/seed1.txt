In this context, the student is likely to fall into a common trap involving the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

### 1. The specific misconception: Left-to-Right Addition Precedence
The misconception is the belief that **Addition must always be performed before Subtraction** because the 'A' comes before the 'S' in the BIDMAS/BODMAS acronym. Students often fail to realise that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be performed in the order they appear from left to right.

### 2. Step-by-step procedure
A student using this "Addition first" buggy procedure would work through the problem like this:

1.  **Identify priority:** The student sees the $4 \times 2$ and correctly identifies that multiplication comes before addition/subtraction.
    *   $4 \times 2 = 8$
    *   The expression is now $3 - 5 + 8$.
2.  **Misinterpret the acronym:** Looking at $3 - 5 + 8$, the student looks at "B-I-D-M-**A-S**" and assumes they must perform the **Addition** $(5 + 8)$ before the **Subtraction**.
3.  **Execute addition:** They calculate $5 + 8 = 13$.
4.  **Execute subtraction:** They take that result and subtract it from the original 3.
    *   $3 - 13 = -10$

### 3. Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: -10**.

*(Note: The correct path is $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 8 = 6$, which is Option A.)*

### 4. Attractiveness of the error
This error is **highly natural** and arguably the most common mistake made by UK Year 9 students when dealing with negative numbers and BIDMAS.

*   **Reliance on the mnemonic:** The student feels they are being mathematically rigorous by following the letters of "BIDMAS" exactly as written. Because "A" is written before "S," doing subtraction first feels like "breaking the rules" to them.
*   **Avoidance of negatives:** Often, students prefer adding $5 + 8$ because it results in a familiar positive number (13), whereas starting from the left ($3 - 5$) immediately forces them to deal with a negative result $(-2)$, which is a cognitive load they may subconsciously try to avoid.
*   **Confidence:** Because the result $(-10)$ appears as a distinct distractor in the multiple-choice list, the student will feel a false sense of "verification." They are unlikely to realise they are wrong because they followed their interpretation of the BIDMAS rule perfectly.
