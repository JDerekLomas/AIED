As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I will focus on a pervasive error involving the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Strict PEMDAS/BIDMAS Order" (specifically, the A-before-S bug)

The misconception is that **Addition must always be performed before Subtraction** because the letter 'A' precedes the letter 'S' in the mnemonic BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction).

In reality, Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be performed from left to right. However, many Year 9 students view the mnemonic as a rigid six-step hierarchy rather than a four-step one.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this "Addition-before-Subtraction" bug would look at $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$ and follow these steps:

1.  **Multiplication First:** They correctly identify that multiplication has higher priority than addition and subtraction.
    *   $4 \times 2 = 8$
    *   The expression becomes: $3 - 5 + 8$
2.  **The Misconception (A before S):** Looking at $3 - 5 + 8$, the student ignores the left-to-right rule. Because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in BIDMAS, they feel compelled to add $5$ and $8$ first.
    *   $5 + 8 = 13$
3.  **Final Calculation:** They substitute the result of the addition back into the expression, maintaining the minus sign.
    *   $3 - 13 = -10$

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: -10**.

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This error is **highly attractive** and one of the most common "hidden" bugs in lower-secondary mathematics. 

*   **Deceptive Clarity:** The student feels they are being a "good mathematician" by strictly following the acronym they were taught. To them, doing the subtraction first feels like "breaking the rules."
*   **Confidence:** Because the student is actively trying to apply a rule (BIDMAS) rather than just guessing from left-to-right, they are often very confident in their answer. 
*   **No Red Flags:** The numbers in $3 - 13$ result in a clean integer ($-10$). Because it doesn't result in a messy fraction or a seemingly "impossible" operation, the student would have no reason to suspect they have made a procedural error. They would likely move to the next question without a second thought, convinced they have successfully applied the order of operations.
