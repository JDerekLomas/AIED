In the context of the UK Year 9 curriculum, a student would typically be familiar with **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). However, the specific misunderstanding of the "A" and "S" relationship is one of the most persistent hurdles at this level.

### 1. The specific misconception: "Rigid Hierarchical Addition-over-Subtraction"
This is a procedural "bug" where the student interprets the BIDMAS acronym as a **strict, linear priority list** rather than as priority groupings. Because the letter 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym, the student believes that *any* addition in an expression must be performed before *any* subtraction, regardless of their position in the string. 

They fail to realize that Addition and Subtraction have **equal priority** and should be solved from left to right.

### 2. Step-by-step working
A student with this misconception would process the expression $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$ in the following order:

1.  **Multiplication first:** They correctly identify that $4 \times 2$ comes first.
    *   *Expression becomes:* $3 - 5 + 8$
2.  **Strict Addition next:** Looking at the remaining operators ($-$) and ($+$), they see that 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS. They isolate the "addition part." 
    *   *Calculation:* They add $5 + 8$ to get $13$. 
3.  **Subtraction last:** They then perform the final subtraction using their previous result.
    *   *Calculation:* $3 - 13$
4.  **Final result:** $-10$.

*(Note: Some students may even calculate $3 - 5$ as $2$, then do $2 + 8$, but the "Rigid Hierarchy" student specifically focuses on the $5 + 8$ cluster first.)*

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option D: $-10$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the error
This error is **highly attractive** and common for several reasons:

*   **Linguistic Trap:** Teachers drill the acronym "BIDMAS" or "BODMAS" into students. In the English language, we read and follow lists in order. Without an explicit explanation that Addition/Subtraction are "co-equal partners," a student is logically justified in thinking A comes before S.
*   **The "Plus" Sign as a Glue:** To many Year 9 students, the $+$ sign looks like it "belongs" to the numbers on either side ($5 + 8$), and it feels more "natural" to combine these positive-looking quantities before dealing with a "difficult" subtraction or a negative result.
*   **Lack of Feedback:** The student will likely **not realize they went wrong.** Their steps are methodical, they followed the letters of the acronym they were taught, and they arrived at a whole number that appears as an option. This provides a false sense of security; they believe they have successfully applied the "rule."
