As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I would identify the specific issue in this question as the **"Literal Order of Operations"** bug, commonly referred to as the **"Order of BIDMAS/BODMAS"** misconception.

### 1. The Misconception: Rigid Hierarchical Interpretation
The student suffers from a **strict hierarchical interpretation of the order of operations.** They believe that the acronym BIDMAS (or BODMAS) is a rigid top-to-bottom checklist, rather than a system of precedence. Specifically, because "A" (Addition) comes before "S" (Subtraction) in the acronym, they believe addition must *always* be performed before subtraction, regardless of their position in the expression.

### 2. Step-by-Step Thinking Process
A student with this misconception would approach the two problems as follows:

**Problem P: $4 - 5 + 6$**
*   The student looks at the operations: Subtraction and Addition.
*   They recall the mnemonic **BIDM<u>A</u><u>S</u>**.
*   They observe that **A** (Addition) comes before **S** (Subtraction) in the word.
*   **Procedural Step:** They look for the addition first. They identify $5 + 6$.
*   **Result:** They decide $5 + 6$ must be done first.

**Problem Q: $4 + 5 \times 6$**
*   The student looks at the operations: Addition and Multiplication.
*   They recall the mnemonic **BID<u>M</u><u>A</u>S**.
*   They observe that **M** (Multiplication) comes before **A** (Addition) in the word.
*   **Procedural Step:** They look for the multiplication first. They identify $5 \times 6$.
*   **Result:** They decide $5 \times 6$ must be done first.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads the student directly to **Option D**.
*   For P: $5 + 6$ (misapplying the Addition-over-Subtraction rule)
*   For Q: $5 \times 6$ (correctly applying Multiplication-over-Addition, but for the wrong reason—it's simply because M is before A in the acronym)

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive and remarkably persistent** in Year 9 students because it is a "logical" application of a rule they have been taught to memorize.

*   **Deceptive Success:** In Problem Q, the student gets the "correct" order for the "wrong" reason. This reinforces their belief that the acronym always works literally. Because they got Q "right" in their head, they assume their logic for P must also be correct.
*   **Linguistic Priming:** We read from left to right, but we are told to use BIDMAS. When the two conflict (as in Problem P), the student trusts the "math rule" (the acronym) over the "reading rule" (left to right).
*   **Invisibility:** A student would **not realize they went wrong.** If they actually calculated $4 - (5 + 6)$, they would get $-7$ instead of the correct $5$. However, because the question only asks *which* operation to do first, they never see the numerical conflict. They feel a high degree of confidence because they have strictly followed the "rules" of the acronym they were told to memorize.
