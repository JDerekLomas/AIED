In the context of the UK Year 9 curriculum, here is an analysis of a highly prevalent misconception regarding the Order of Operations.

### 1. The Misconception: Rigid "BODMAS" Hierarchy (Addition before Subtraction)
The specific bug is the **strict alphabetical priority of operations**. Many students interpret the acronym BODMAS (or BIDMAS) as a rigid, linear sequence of six steps, rather than a hierarchy of four levels. Specifically, because "A" (Addition) comes before "S" (Subtraction) in the acronym, students believe addition **must** be performed first, regardless of its position in the expression. This is a failure to understand that Addition and Subtraction possess equal priority and should be processed from left to right.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the problems as follows:

*   **Problem P (\(4 - 5 + 6\)):**
    *   The student looks at the expression and identifies two operations: subtraction and addition.
    *   Recalling the "BODMAS" acronym, they note that 'A' comes before 'S'.
    *   Instead of working left to right, they jump to the addition part of the problem.
    *   They identify the addition as **\(5 + 6\)** (often ignoring the negative sign associated with the 5).
    *   *Decision:* They decide they must do \(5 + 6\) first.

*   **Problem Q (\(4 + 5 \times 6\)):**
    *   The student identifies addition and multiplication.
    *   In the acronym, 'M' (Multiplication) comes before 'A' (Addition).
    *   *Decision:* They correctly identify that they must do \(5 \times 6\) first (in this specific case, the hierarchy helps them, but for Problem P, it led them astray).

### 3. Selection
This misconception leads the student to select **Option D**.
(Problem P: \(5+6\); Problem Q: \(5\times6\))

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This is one of the most "attractive" and "natural" errors in secondary mathematics because it is a **learned misconception**.

*   **Reliance on Mnemonics:** Students rely on the mnemonic "BODMAS" as a literal rule of law rather than a guide. To a Year 9 student, "A before S" seems like a logical, objective rule.
*   **Visual Lure:** In Problem P, the "+" sign acts as a visual "magnet." It feels "cleaner" to add two whole numbers (\(5+6\)) than to deal with the potential of a negative result from \(4-5\).
*   **Lack of Feedback:** A student would likely **not realise they are wrong**. Unless the teacher specifically highlights the "equal priority" rule for Addition/Subtraction (and Multiplication/Division), the student will feel confident that they have followed the "official" procedure correctly. They have "followed the steps" of BODMAS, which provides a false sense of security.
