As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a primary error often found in UK Year 9 classrooms (age 13–14).

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Operation Overload" (Confusing Multiplicative Inverse with Additive Inverse)
The most precise name for this bug is **Sign Change Confusion in Inversion**. Many students at this level learn two rules simultaneously:
*   To get back to zero (addition), you change the sign ($x$ becomes $-x$).
*   To get back to one (multiplication), you flip the fraction ($x$ becomes $1/x$).

The misconception occurs when the student believes that to "invert" a number for **any** purpose, they must perform **both** actions: flipping the fraction *and* changing the sign.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Thinking
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:
*   **Step 1:** Observe the equation $-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$.
*   **Step 2:** Recognize that they need to "undo" the $-\frac{3}{4}$ to get to an answer involving the number 1. They recall that the reciprocal involves turning the fraction upside down.
*   **Step 3:** They mentally flip $-\frac{3}{4}$ to get $-\frac{4}{3}$.
*   **Step 4 (The Bug):** They falsely apply the "rule" of inverses they learned from addition/subtraction. They think: *"To move it to the other side or balance it, I must also change the sign."*
*   **Step 5:** They change the negative sign to a positive sign, resulting in $+\frac{4}{3}$.
*   **Step 6:** They check their result against the options and see A is an exact match.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: $\frac{4}{3}$**.

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This error is **highly attractive** and one of the most common pitfalls in KS3 algebra. 
*   **Internal Logic:** The student feels they have done "more work" and followed "more rules," which often gives them a false sense of security. They feel that because the original number was "complicated" (negative and a fraction), the answer should look "opposite" in every way.
*   **Lack of Verification:** The student rarely performs the actual multiplication to check. If they did ($-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3}$), they would see it equals $-1$, which is exactly what the question asks for. However, many students misinterpret the question as wanting to result in $+1$ (the identity element) rather than $-1$, or they simply see Option A as the "mathematical opposite" of the starting term.
*   **Realization:** The student would **not** realize they were wrong. Because $\frac{4}{3}$ looks so much like a standard "answer" to a fraction problem, they would likely circle Option A and move on with high confidence, unaware that the negative sign in the result was already accounted for by the question itself.
