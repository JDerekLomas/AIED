As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified the following specific error for this Year 9 question.

### 1. The Misconception: "Reciprocal Negation Overload" (Confusing Reciprocals with Opposites)
The specific bug is a confusion between the **multiplicative inverse** (the reciprocal, which flips the fraction) and the **additive inverse** (the opposite, which changes the sign). 

In Year 9, students are introduced to the rule that "a negative times a negative equals a positive." Because the target answer is $-1$, students often over-apply this rule. They believe that since the starting fraction is negative, the multiplier *must* be positive to maintain a negative outcome, while simultaneously remembering they need to "flip" the fraction to get a result of 1.

### 2. Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:
1.  **Analyze the sign:** They look at the $-\frac{3}{4}$ and the result $-1$. They think: *"The answer is negative, and I’m starting with a negative. A negative times a positive is a negative, so the star must be a positive number."*
2.  **Determine the magnitude:** They look at $\frac{3}{4}$ and think: *"To get back to 1, I need the reciprocal of 3/4."*
3.  **Execute the flip:** They flip $\frac{3}{4}$ to get $\frac{4}{3}$.
4.  **Combine:** They keep the positive sign from Step 1 and the fraction from Step 3, resulting in $+\frac{4}{3}$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: $\frac{4}{3}$**.

### 4. How Natural/Attractive is this error?
This is a **highly attractive** error for a Year 9 student. At this level, students are often bombarded with "Sign Rules" and "Fraction Rules" simultaneously, leading to a cognitive overload where they mix the two. 

The student is unlikely to realize they are wrong because Option A "feels" mathematically sophisticated. It involves a calculation (the flip) and a conscious decision about the sign. Because they correctly identified that $3/4 \times 4/3 = 1$, they feel they have done the "hard part" of the math. They overlook the fact that $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3}$ actually equals $-1$ already, because their brain is hyper-focused on the "double negative makes a positive" rule, which they mistakenly apply to the goal of keeping the answer negative. 

They won't realize they are wrong until they are prompted to check the calculation: $(-\frac{3}{4}) \times (\frac{4}{3}) = -\frac{12}{12} = -1$. Only then would they see that adding an extra negative sign (Option B) would actually result in $+1$.
