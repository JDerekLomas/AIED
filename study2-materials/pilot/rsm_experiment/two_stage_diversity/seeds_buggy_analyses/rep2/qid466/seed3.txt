As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a primary error common among students transitioning from arithmetic to early algebraic manipulation.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Sign-Change via Inverse Operation Confusion"
This is a specific procedural "bug" where the student conflates two different types of mathematical inverses: the **additive inverse** (changing the sign) and the **multiplicative inverse** (the reciprocal). 

In the UK Year 9 curriculum, students learn that to "undo" an operation, you perform the opposite. When a student sees a negative number, their ingrained habit is often to "make it positive" to cancel it out, forgetting that the operation occurring is multiplication, not addition. They mistakenly believe that to move a negative fraction across the equals sign, both the fraction must flip **and** the sign must change.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Reasoning
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:
1. **Identify the goal:** "I need to get $\star$ by itself. I have $-3/4$ multiplying it, so I need to do the inverse."
2. **Apply the Reciprocal:** "The opposite of $3/4$ is $4/3$. I'll flip the fraction."
3. **Misapply the Sign Rule:** "Since the number is negative, the inverse must be positive. To cancel out a minus, I need a plus." 
4. **Final Calculation:** They look at the equation and think: $(-3/4) \times (+4/3)$. They often ignore the result on the right-hand side ($-1$) or assume that because they have "inverted everything" (both fraction and sign), it must be correct.
5. **Match to Option:** They conclude the answer is $+4/3$.

### 3. Corresponding Answer Option
This misconception leads directly to **Option A: $\frac{4}{3}$**.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly attractive** and often feels "mathematically elegant" to a Year 9 student. Here is why:
*   **Symmetry:** Students are often taught that "minus and minus makes a plus." If they see a negative result ($-1$), they may instinctively feel that multiplying two negatives (the correct path) would result in a positive, which contradicts the $-1$ they see. Therefore, they "fix" this by choosing a positive number.
*   **Over-generalization:** In early algebra (solving $x - 5 = 10$), students learn that "minus becomes plus." They incorrectly carry this rule over to multiplication ($ax = b$), assuming the negative coefficient must become positive when "moved."
*   **Likelihood of Realization:** The student is **very unlikely** to realize they are wrong. Because $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = 1$, the numerical magnitude feels correct. If they do a quick mental check, they might say "Three-quarters of four-thirds is one," and completely overlook the sign requirement because the numerical "flipping" feels so satisfying.
