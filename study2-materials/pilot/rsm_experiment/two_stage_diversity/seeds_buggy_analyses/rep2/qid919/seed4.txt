In the context of UK Year 9 mathematics (Foundation and Higher), the most common error in this scenario involves a failure to distinguish between powers and place value logic, specifically relating to squaring decimals.

### 1. The specific misconception: "Squaring keeps the same number of decimal places"
The student understands they need to substitute $0.3$ into $y=3x^2$ and follows the correct Order of Operations (BIDMAS), calculating the power before the multiplication. However, they possess a fundamental misconception regarding decimal multiplication. They believe that because $3^2 = 9$, then $0.3^2$ must be $0.9$. They mistakenly believe that "squaring a number with one decimal place results in an answer with one decimal place."

### 2. Step-by-step student workflow
A student with this misconception would follow these steps:

1.  **Substitution:** Write the expression $y = 3 \times (0.3)^2$.
2.  **Order of Operations:** Correcty identify that the squaring must happen before the multiplication by 3.
3.  **The Error (Decimal Squaring):** Calculate $0.3 \times 0.3$. Reasoning that $3 \times 3 = 9$, they simply place the decimal point to maintain one decimal place, concluding that **$0.3^2 = 0.9$**. 
4.  **Final Multiplication:** Multiply their result by 3: $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads directly to **Option D (2.7)**.

*(Note: If they failed BIDMAS and multiplied first, $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2$, they might reach 0.81 [Option A] through similar decimal logic errors).*

### 4. How natural/attractive this error is
This error is **highly natural and deceptive**. 

*   **Linguistic reinforcement:** Students often hear "three tenths squared" and intuitively think the answer should still be in "tenths" (0.9) rather than "hundredths" (0.09).
*   **False generalization:** In Year 7 and 8, students are often told "the number of decimal places stays the same" when *adding* or *subtracting* decimals. They frequently over-generalize this rule to multiplication.
*   **Low "Cognitive Conflict":** The answer $2.7$ looks "sensible" to a student. It is larger than the input $0.3$ (matching their expectation of squaring positive integers) but not "messy" like $0.27$. 

Because $2.7$ appears as an explicit distractor, the student will feel a high sense of confidence in their result. They are unlikely to realize they are wrong unless prompted to convert the decimal to a fraction (e.g., $(\frac{3}{10})^2 = \frac{9}{100}$) to check their work.
