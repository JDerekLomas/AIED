In this scenario, the student correctly completes Step 1 but fails in Step 2.

### 1. The specific misconception: The "Operation-Sign Attachment" Bug (specifically, Inverse Operation Confusion)
The student is committing a procedural error in **isolating the variable**. The specific bug is the belief that "the sign currently in the equation is the operation I should perform on the constant," or more simply, failing to perform the **inverse** operation when moving a term across the equals sign. Instead of subtracting 1 from both sides to undo the addition, the student simply "combines" the numbers 60 and 1 using the addition sign already present in the expression $1+k$.

### 2. The step-by-step student work
*   **Step 1:** The student recognizes that the denominator (4) must be removed. They correctly identify that "divide by 4" needs to be undone by multiplying by 4. They calculate $15 \times 4 = 60$. They write: **$60 = 1 + k$**. (This step is correct).
*   **Step 2:** The student looks at $60 = 1 + k$. Their brain focuses on the "1" and the "+". Rather than thinking, "How do I get rid of positive 1?" they think, "I have 60 and I have $+1$."
*   They perform the calculation $60 + 1 = 61$.
*   They conclude: **$k = 61$**. (This step is incorrect).

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads the student to choose **A) Only Step 1**.

The student would look at their own result ($k=61$) and see it matches Isaac’s Step 2. They would then evaluate Isaac's Step 1 and realize it is a necessary part of the process. Since Isaac’s Step 1 is mathematically sound and his Step 2 matches the student's own flawed logic, the student confirms that Step 1 is "Correct" and then incorrectly identifies that Isaac followed the logic they themselves would use. (Note: In a multiple-choice setting, a student who makes this mistake may be confused if they believe Step 2 is correct but have to choose only one answer—however, scientifically, the "correct" evaluation of Isaac's work is that only Step 1 is valid).

### 4. How natural/attractive this error is
This is an **extremely attractive error** for Year 9 students. At this stage, many students are transitioning from "informal arithmetic" (just combining numbers) to "formal algebra" (balancing equations).
*   **Perceptual Attraction:** The "+" sign is visually "stuck" to the 1. The student sees "60", "1", and "+" and instinctively reacts by adding. 
*   **Self-Correction Likelihood:** The student is **unlikely to realize they went wrong** without a prompt to "check" their answer. If they substituted 61 back into the original equation, they would get $62/4 = 15.5$. However, most students find $k=61$ to be a "neat" integer result, which provides a false sense of security that the procedure was successful. Often, students only realize the error when they are forced to deal with the negative sign (e.g., $60 = 1 - k$).
