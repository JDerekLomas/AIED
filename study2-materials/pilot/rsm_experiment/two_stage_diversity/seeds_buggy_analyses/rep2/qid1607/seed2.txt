In this scenario, the student correctly completes Step 1 but fails in Step 2. This reflects a highly specific and common stage of algebra development in UK Year 9 classrooms.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Operation-Sign Carryover" (The Inverse Property Confusion)
The student has a procedural "bug" regarding **inverse operations**. They understand that solving an equation requires "moving" a number to the other side of the equals sign, but they fail to apply the inverse operation (subtraction) to the constant ($+1$). Instead, they "carry over" the positive nature of the number and perform the same operation shown in the expression.

Essentially, the student follows the rule: *"To move a number, perform the operation that connects it to the variable."* Since $1$ is added to $k$, they add $1$ to $60$.

### 2. The Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would work as follows:

*   **Step 1:** They look at the $\div 4$ and correctly identify that the inverse is $\times 4$. They calculate $15 \times 4 = 60$. They write $60 = 1 + k$. They feel confident because "60" is a clean number and a common result in these types of problems.
*   **Step 2:** They look at the $1$ being added to $k$. Instead of thinking "How do I undo $+1$?", they think "I have a $60$ and a $1$, and they are linked by a plus sign."
*   **The Calculation:** They perform $60 + 1 = 61$. 
*   **Result:** They conclude $k = 61$.

### 3. The Chosen Answer Option
This misconception leads the student to choose **Option A (Only step 1 is correct)**.

The student will identify that Step 1 is mathematically sound. However, when they compare their own result ($k = 61$) to Isaac’s Step 2 ($61 = k$), they will see a perfect match. If the student realizes their own logic matches Isaac's, but then reflects (or is prompted) that the "undoing" of addition is subtraction, they might realize Isaac made a mistake. 

However, most students holding this bug believe Isaac is **entirely correct**, leading them to choose **C (Both steps are correct)**. If they are slightly more advanced, they might spot that while Isaac's Step 1 followed the rules, the second step was "adding instead of subtracting," but usually, this specific error is so ingrained that they view Isaac as a model student.

### 4. Attractivity and Realization
**This error is highly attractive and feels very "natural."** 

*   **The "Plus" Bias:** Students see the "$+$" sign in "$1 + k$" and their brain defaults to the operation of addition rather than the logic of balance. 
*   **Confirmation Bias:** $60 + 1$ is a "friendly" calculation. $61$ feels like a plausible answer for a Year 9 algebra question. 
*   **Lack of Checking:** The student would almost certainly **not** realize they went wrong unless they were explicitly taught to check their answer by substitution. If they plugged $61$ back into the original equation ($15 = \frac{1 + 61}{4}$), they would get $15 = \frac{62}{4}$, which is $15.5$. 
*   **The "Invisible" error:** To the student, they "moved" the 1 over. In their mental model, "moving" a number and "adding" a number are sometimes conflated. Without the habit of checking, this error is "silent" and will persist throughout the student's work.
