As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I have identified a prevalent procedural error regarding the **Distributive Property of Operations in Equations**.

### 1. The Specific Misconception: "Partial Distribution" (or Selective Multiplication)
The specific bug here is **Katie’s**. The error is the belief that when multiplying an equation by a denominator to "cancel it out," one only needs to multiply the term containing the fraction, rather than every term on both sides of the equation.

The student understands the inverse operation (multiplying by 3 to undo a division by 3) but fails to treat the equation as a balanced whole. They treat the $-5$ as an independent entity that is "outside" the reach of the multiplication because it doesn't have a denominator.

### 2. The Step-by-Step Procedure
A student with this misconception would approach the problem as follows:
1. **Goal Setting:** They identify that the fraction $\frac{x}{3}$ is the most "difficult" part and decide to multiply by 3 to eliminate it.
2. **Execution:** They multiply the first term $(\frac{x}{3} \times 3 = x)$.
3. **The Error:** They skip the second term because it is not a fraction, simply "bringing down" the $-5$.
4. **Consistency:** They correctly multiply the right-hand side $(12 \times 3 = 36)$.
5. **Resulting Line:** They arrive at $x - 5 = 36$.
6. **Final Conclusion:** They see Katie's working matches their result and assume she is correct. Since Tom also followed a correct (albeit different) first step—adding 5 to both sides to get $\frac{x}{3} = 17$—the student concludes that **both** methods are valid.

### 3. Resulting Answer Option
This misconception leads the student to choose **C) Both Tom and Katie**.

The student recognizes Tom is correct (standard "letters one side, numbers the other" approach) but believes Katie has simply found a "shortcut" or an alternative valid sequence.

### 4. Attractiveness of the Error
This error is **highly natural and extremely attractive** to Year 9 students for several reasons:
*   **Visual Priority:** The $-5$ is physically separated from the fraction. Students often view an equation as a series of "blocks." If the 3 is "under" the $x$, they feel its power is restricted to the $x$.
*   **Cognitive Load:** Distributing the 3 to every single term (especially a constant) feels counter-intuitive to a student who is laser-focused on "getting rid of the fraction."
*   **Lack of Verification:** The student would **not realize they went wrong** because the resulting equation $(x - 5 = 36 \rightarrow x = 41)$ produces a "neat" integer answer. They rarely substitute their answer back into the original equation ($\frac{41}{3} - 5 \neq 12$), which is the only way they would discover the inconsistency.

In a classroom setting, this is the #1 reason why students struggle with equations involving multiple terms and denominators.
