As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I will focus on a specific, very common error among Key Stage 3 students regarding the **order of operations in inverse algebraic manipulation.**

### 1. The specific misconception: The "Partial Distributive Multiplication" Bug
The misconception occurs when a student knows they need to "undo" a division by multiplying, but they fail to recognize that the multiplication must be applied to **every term** on both sides of the equation. 

Specifically, the student believes they can "isolate" the $x$ by multiplying by the denominator without applying that multiplier to the constant term $(-5)$ that is not part of the fraction. This is a failure to treat the left-hand side as a single binomial expression.

### 2. Step-by-Step student work (with the bug)
A student with this misconception would analyze Katie's statement ($x - 5 = 36$) as follows:

1.  **Identify the goal:** The student sees the $/3$ and knows they need to multiply by $3$ to move it.
2.  **Execute the "Move":** They multiply the $x/3$ by $3$ to get $x$.
3.  **Multiply the RHS:** they multiply $12 \times 3$ to get $36$.
4.  **The Error Step:** Because the $-5$ is not "over the 3," they believe it remains untouched. They simply "bring it down."
5.  **Result:** They write $x - 5 = 36$.
6.  **Verification:** They look at Tom’s working ($x/3 = 17$). They recognize this as adding $5$ to both sides, which they also know is a valid algebraic rule.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads the student to choose **C) Both Tom and Katie.**

The student recognizes Tom's move (adding 5) as "correct" based on their knowledge of balancing equations. However, because of the "Partial Distributive Multiplication" bug, they *also* believe Katie’s move is a legitimate way to "clear the fraction" first.

### 4. How attractive is this error?
This error is **highly attractive and "sticky."**

*   **Visual Logic:** Students often view an equation as a collection of "objects" rather than a balanced relationship. To a Year 9 student, the $-5$ looks physically separate from the $\frac{x}{3}$. It feels intuitively correct that the $3$ only "belongs" to the $x$, so multiplying should only affect the $x$ and the "other side" of the equals sign.
*   **Lack of Internal Conflict:** A student will not realize they are wrong because they are correctly applying a rule (the inverse of division is multiplication), just incorrectly applying its scope. 
*   **The "One Thing at a Time" Bias:** Students are often taught to "do the same thing to both sides." In their mind, they *are* doing that: they are multiplying the "fraction part" and the "answer part" by 3. Neglecting the $-5$ doesn't feel like a mistake; it feels like leaving an unrelated term alone until its "turn" comes. 

Because both Tom's and Katie's steps result in "cleaner" looking equations, a student is very likely to conclude that math is flexible and both paths are simply different ways to reach the same goal.
