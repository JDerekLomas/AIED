As an expert in mathematical misconceptions, I will focus on a specific, very common error involving **inverse operations and the distributive property of division.**

### 1. The specific misconception: The "Partial Multiplier" Bug
The "Partial Multiplier" (or **Failure to Distribute across the Constant**) is a specific procedural bug. It occurs when a student knows that the "inverse of divide by 3 is multiply by 3," but they fail to realize that multiplication must be applied to the **entire side** of the equation (the entire expression) rather than just the fractional term.

In this specific case, the student applies the $\times 3$ to $\frac{x}{3}$ to get $x$, and to $12$ to get $36$, but they "jump over" or ignore the $-5$.

### 2. Step-by-Step Student Working
A student with the **Partial Multiplier** bug would solve the problem as follows:

1.  **Analyze the Equation:** They see $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$. They decide they want to get rid of the fraction first (often because they find fractions intimidating).
2.  **Apply Inverse Operation:** They know they need to multiply by $3$.
3.  **The Error:** They multiply the $x$ term: $\frac{x}{3} \times 3 = x$. 
4.  **The Error (continued):** They leave the $-5$ exactly as it is because "it's not part of the fraction."
5.  **Balance the Equation:** They multiply the right-hand side: $12 \times 3 = 36$.
6.  **Final "Next Line":** They write $x - 5 = 36$. 

The student believes they have successfully "cleared the fraction" while keeping the equation balanced, unaware that they have changed the value of the $-5$ relative to the other terms.

### 3. Which answer option this leads to
This misconception leads the student to conclude that **Katie is correct.** 
Since Tom's working ($\frac{x}{3} = 17$) is mathematically sound (adding 5 to both sides first), the student will see both methods as valid alternatives. 

Therefore, this misconception leads directly to **Option C (Both Tom and Katie).**

### 4. How natural/attractive is this error?
This error is **highly attractive** and extremely common among Year 9 students for several reasons:

*   **The "Visual Separation" Illusion:** In the expression $\frac{x}{3} - 5$, the $-5$ is physically separated from the fraction. Students often perceive the equation as having three distinct "blocks." They feel that multiplying the first block by 3 and the third block (the 12) by 3 is enough to "balance" the scales.
*   **Selective Application:** Students often follow a "if it's not broken, don't fix it" mentality. Since the $-5$ doesn't have a denominator, they don't see why it needs to be multiplied.
*   **Lack of Meta-cognition:** A student would **not** realize they went wrong. To them, Katie’s line $x - 5 = 36$ looks "cleaner" and easier to solve than the original. It follows a logical (though flawed) rhythm of "doing the same thing to both sides." They would only realize the error if they checked their final answer ($x=41$) back into the original equation and found that $13.66 - 5 \neq 12$.
