Volume of a sphere... I remember the formula is something with a $4/3$. 

Is it $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^2$? No, volume is always cubed.
So $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$.

I need to find $r$.
First, get rid of the $3$.
$3V = 4 \pi r^3$

Now move the $4\pi$ to the other side.
$\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$

To get $r$ on its own I need to square root? No, it's a 3 so it must be a cube root.
$r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$

Let me look at the options. 
A has $4V\pi$ at the top - that's wrong.
B has $4V$ at the top - wait, did I put the 3 in the wrong place?
$\frac{4}{3}$ means the 3 is on the bottom, so when it moves it goes to the top. Yeah, $3V$. 
C has $3V$ on top and $4\pi$ on the bottom. 

D looks weird because the cube root is only over the $V$.

So it's C.

Answer: C
