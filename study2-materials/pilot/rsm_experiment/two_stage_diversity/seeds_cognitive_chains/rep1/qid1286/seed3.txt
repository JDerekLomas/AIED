Volume of a sphere = $\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$ (i think? or is it $4 \pi r^2$? no that's surface area)

So $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$

Need to get $r$ by itself. 

Step 1: Get rid of the $\frac{4}{3}$. Multiply by 4? No, wait. To get rid of a fraction you multiply by the bottom number. 
Multiply by 3:
$3V = 4 \pi r^3$

Step 2: Get $r$ on its own. 
$3V / 4 = \pi r^3$
~~Then divide by pi~~

Actually, $3V$ over $4 \pi = r^3$
$r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$

Step 3: To get $r$ i need the square root? 
No its a little 3 so it's a cube root. 

$r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$

Looking at the options...
A is $4V \pi / 3$ (wrong way up)
B is $4V / 3\pi$ (still got the 4 on top)
C is $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$ 
D looks weird.

The answer is C.

Answer: C
