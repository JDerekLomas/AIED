Volume of a sphere... I think the formula is $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$.

I need to get $r$ by itself because the question asks for the radius.

Step 1: Get rid of the $\frac{4}{3}$.
If I move it to the other side, I have to flip it? Or multiply by 4?
$3V = 4 \pi r^3$

Now I need to move the $4$ and the $\pi$.
$\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$

~~Wait is it $\frac{4\pi}{3V}$?~~ No, because you divide by the things next to the $r$.

So $r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$

To get $r$, I need the square root? No, it's a 3 so it's a cube root.
$r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$

Looking at the options:
A is $4V\pi / 3$ - no.
B is $4V / 3\pi$ - that's upside down.
C is $3V / 4\pi$ inside the root. That looks right.
D has the root only over the V part.

Final Answer: C
