Volume of a sphere... umm I think it's $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$ or is it $4 \pi r^2$? No, $r^2$ is area because it's squared. So $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$.

Need to get $r$ by itself.

$V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$

First move the 3.
$3V = 4 \pi r^3$

Now move the $4\pi$.
$\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$

Wait, do I divide by 4 or multiply? 
If it's $\frac{4}{3}$, I multiply by 3 then divide by 4. Yeah.

So $r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$

To get $r$ I need to do the square root? No, it's a 3 so it's a cube root.
$r = \sqrt{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$  $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$

Looking at the options:
A is $4V\pi / 3$ - no, the 3 is on the bottom there.
B is $4V / 3\pi$ - that's upside down.
C is $3V / 4\pi$ inside the root. That looks like mine.
D is different, the root is only on the V.

Check again. 
$V = 4/3 \pi r^3$
$3V = 4 \pi r^3$
$3V / 4\pi = r^3$
Yeah, it's C.

Answer: C
