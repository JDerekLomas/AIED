8+12 / 4 [  ] (8+12) / 4

LHS (left side):
8 + 12 = 20
20 divided by 4 = 5
~~LHS is 5~~
Wait, I remember BIDMAS. Division comes before plus?
Okay, 12 / 4 = 3
Then 8 + 3 = 11
So LHS = 11

RHS (right side):
(8 + 12) / 4
The brackets are first. 
8 + 12 = 20
Then 20 / 4 = 5

So it is 11 and 5.
11 is bigger than 5. 

I always forget which way the arrow points. The big side points to the big number? No, the mouth eats the bigger number. 
11 > 5
