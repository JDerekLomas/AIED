8+12 divided by 4... okay so 8 plus 12 is 20. Then 20 / 4 = 5.

Wait, I remember BIDMAS. Division comes before adding.
So its 12 / 4 first. 
12 divided by 4 = 3.
Then 8 + 3 = 11. 
Yeah, so the left side is **11**.

Now the other side:
(8+12) / 4
The brackets mean I do that bit first.
8+12 is 20.
Then 20 / 4 = 5.

So its 11 on the left and 5 on the right.
11 is bigger than 5. 
So it must be the arrow pointing that way --> no wait, the mouth eats the bigger number.

11 > 5

A is >
B is <
