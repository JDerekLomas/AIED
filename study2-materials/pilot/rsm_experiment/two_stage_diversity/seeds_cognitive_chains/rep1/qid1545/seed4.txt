Right, so I need to see which side is bigger.

First bit: $8 + 12 \div 4$
Um, ok. $8 + 12 = 20$.
Then $20 \div 4 = 5$.
So the first side is 5.

Second bit: $(8 + 12) \div 4$
The brackets mean you do that part first.
$8 + 12 = 20$.
$20 \div 4 = 5$.

Wait, they are both 5?
$5 = 5$? 
So is it C?

Hold on, I always forget the BIDMAS thing. My teacher says divide comes before add.
Let me try the first one again.
$8 + 12 \div 4$
If I do the divide first... $12 \div 4 = 3$.
Then $8 + 3 = 11$.

Okay, so:
Left side = 11
Right side = $(8 + 12) \div 4$
Brackets first, so $8 + 12 = 20$.
Then $20 \div 4 = 5$.

So it's 11 on the left and 5 on the right.
11 is bigger than 5.
The symbol for bigger is... $\rightarrow$ ~~<~~ no, $>$. Like an alligator eating the big number.

Working:
$8 + 12 \div 4 = 8 + 3 = 11$
$(8+12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$
$11 > 5$

Final Answer: A
