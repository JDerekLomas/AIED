Right, so I need to see which side is bigger.

First bit: $8 + 12 \div 4$
Um, ok. $8 + 12$ is $20$.
$20 \div 4 = 5$.
Wait, I remember the teacher saying something about the order. BIDMAS?
Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.
So division comes first.
$12 \div 4 = 3$.
Then $8 + 3 = 11$.
Yeah, that looks right. So the left side is 11.

Now the other side: $(8 + 12) \div 4$
This one has brackets. B is for brackets, so do that first.
$8 + 12 = 20$.
Then $20 \div 4 = 5$.

So I've got $11$ on the left and $5$ on the right.
$11$ is definitely bigger than $5$.

Which symbol is which?
L-shape is less than... so $>$ is more than.
$11 > 5$.

Wait, did I do the first one right?
$8+12 \div 4$
If I did $8+12$ first it's $20...$ no, BIDMAS says divide first.
So $12 \div 4 = 3$.
$8+3=11$.
And the second one is $20 \div 4 = 5$.
~~$11 < 5$~~
No, $11$ is bigger.

So it's A.

Answer: A
