Right, so I need to see which side is bigger.

First bit:
$8 + 12 \div 4$
Um, okay. 8 plus 12 is 20.
Then $20 \div 4 = 5$.
Wait, no. My teacher said something about the order. BIDMAS?
Divide comes before add.
So, $12 \div 4 = 3$.
Then $8 + 3 = 11$.
Yeah, so the left side is 11.

Now the other side:
$(8 + 12) \div 4$
Brackets first.
$8 + 12$ is definitely 20.
Then $20 \div 4$...
4, 8, 12, 16, 20... that's 5.

So it's 11 on the left and 5 on the right.
~~11 < 5~~
No, 11 is bigger than 5.
The crocodile eats the bigger number.
So $11 > 5$.

Wait, did I do the first one right?
$8 + 12 = 20... \div 4 = 5$
No, BIDMAS. Division first. $12 \div 4 = 3$. $8+3=11$.
And the other one is $(20) \div 4 = 5$.

So it's 11 and 5. 11 is definitely more.
