So, I need to add these two fractions together.

$2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5}$

First, I’ll look at the big numbers. $2 + 1 = 3$. 

Now the fractions part. It's $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{2}{5}$. 
Um... $1 + 2 = 3$. 
And for the bottom numbers, do I add them? $5 + 5 = 10$. 

Wait, so that's $3 \frac{3}{10}$.

Let me check. $\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}$... no, wait. My teacher said if the denominator is the same, it stays the same? 
~~$3 \frac{3}{10}$~~

If the bottom stays as 5, then it's $\frac{3}{5}$.
So $2+1$ is $3$, and $\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}$ is $\frac{3}{5}$.

Is it A or B? 
B is $\frac{18}{5}$. Let me check that. 
$3 \times 5 = 15$. 
$15 + 3 = 18$.
Oh, so $3 \frac{3}{5}$ is the same as $\frac{18}{5}$? 

The question says "Leave your answer as a mixed number". 
Mixed number is the one with the big number at the front. 
So A.

Answer: A
