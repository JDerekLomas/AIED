So, first I look at the big numbers.
2 + 1 = 3. 

Then I have to do the fractions bit.
$\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}$

Wait, do I add the bottom numbers? 5 + 5 is 10... no, Mrs. Smith said when the bottom numbers are the same you just leave them? Or do I add them? 
If I add them it's $\frac{3}{10}$. 
So maybe $3 \frac{3}{10}$? That's option D.

Let me double check. 
$\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$ 
Yeah, you don't add the denominators. I remember now.

So it's 3 and then $\frac{3}{5}$.

Is that one of the choices?
A is $3 \frac{3}{5}$
B is $\frac{18}{5}$

Wait, $\frac{18}{5}$ looks like it might be the same? 
$5 \times 3$ is 15... plus 3 is 18. So $3 \frac{3}{5}$ is $\frac{18}{5}$.
Both A and B are the same thing? 
Oh, the question says "leave your answer as a mixed number".
A is a mixed number. B is a top-heavy fraction.

Wait, I hope I didn't mess up the bottom number. 5 + 5 is 10? 
$\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}$
No, keep it as 5.

So it's $3 \frac{3}{5}$.

Answer: A
