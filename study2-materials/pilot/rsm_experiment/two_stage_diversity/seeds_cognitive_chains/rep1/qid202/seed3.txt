So, first I look at the big numbers at the front. 
$2 + 1 = 3$

Now the fractions part. It's $\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}$
Ummm... $\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}$ equals... 
Is it $\frac{3}{10}$? Wait, no, the bottom stays the same when you add them. 
I think. 

Let me try converting them to top-heavy fractions instead because that's what we did in class last week. 
$2 \frac{1}{5}$ 
$2 \times 5$ is $10$
$+ 1$ is $11$
So $\frac{11}{5}$

Then $1 \frac{2}{5}$
$1 \times 5$ is $5$
$+ 2$ is $7$
So $\frac{7}{5}$

Now add them:
$\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{10}$ ~~No~~ $\frac{18}{5}$

The question says leave it as a mixed number though. 
How many $5$s go into $18$? 
$5, 10, 15, 20...$ so $3$ times. 
$18 - 15 = 3$ 
So it's $3$ and $\frac{3}{5}$.

Looking at the options:
A is $3 \frac{3}{5}$
B is $\frac{18}{5}$ (that's what I got before converting)
C is $\frac{18}{10}$
D is $3 \frac{3}{10}$ (this is what I would have got if I added the bottoms)

A looks right. 

Final answer: A
