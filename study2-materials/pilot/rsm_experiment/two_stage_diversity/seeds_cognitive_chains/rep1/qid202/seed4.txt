So, i need to add the whole numbers first i think. 
2 + 1 = 3

And then the fractions... 
1/5 + 2/5 
Does the bottom number change? Um. 5 + 5 is 10.
Wait, no, you keep the denominator the same if they are already the same? 
1 + 2 = 3

So it’s 3 and 3 over ~~10~~ 5? 
If it’s 3 and 3/10 that's D.
Let me check... 
2 and 1/5 is 11/5
1 and 2/5 is 7/5
11 + 7 is 18.
So 18/5.
18/5 is... 5, 10, 15... that's 3 and 3 left over. 
3 3/5. 

I almost did the 10 thing but the 5 stays.
A is 3 3/5.
B is 18/5 which is the same thing but it says leave it as a mixed number. 
So it’s A. 

Answer: A
