So, first I look at the big numbers at the front. 
$2 + 1 = 3$ 
Easy. 

Then the fractions part is $\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}$. 
I have to add them together. 
$1 + 2 = 3$ 
and $5 + 5 = 10$. 
Wait, no, you don't add the bottom numbers when they are the same... do you? 
Actually, I think you do? $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{2}{5}$ makes $\frac{3}{10}$.

~~$3 \frac{3}{5}$~~ 
If I keep the 5 at the bottom, it's $3 \frac{3}{5}$.

Let me check.
$2 \times 5 = 10$, $+ 1 = 11$. So $\frac{11}{5}$.
$1 \times 5 = 5$, $+ 2 = 7$. So $\frac{7}{5}$.
$\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}$

Now I have to change it back to a mixed number. 
How many 5s go into 18? 
5, 10, 15... that's 3. 
And then there's 3 left over. 
So it's $3$ and $\frac{3}{5}$. 

I nearly picked D because I thought the bottom numbers added up to 10, but I think it stays as 5. 

My answer is A.
