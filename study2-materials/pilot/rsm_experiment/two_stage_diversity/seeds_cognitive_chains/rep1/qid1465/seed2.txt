3 - 5 + 4 x 2

Okay so first is 3 take away 5 which is -2.
Then plus 4 which is 2. 
Then 2 times 2 is 4.

Wait, I forgot BIDMAS.  My teacher said you have to do the multiplying first.

4 x 2 = 8

So it's 3 - 5 + 8

3 - 5 is 2.  No, it's -2. 
-2 + 8...  is that -10?  No, it's like 8 - 2. 

~~8-2 = 6~~

Wait let me try again.
3 - 5 = -2 
-2 + 4 = 2 
2 x 2 = 4

But if I do the x first it's 8.
3 - 5 is -2
-2 + 8 
Um, 8, 7, 6.

Is it B or A? 
If I just go left to right: 
3-5 = -2
-2 + 4 = 2
2 * 2 = 4. 

I'll go with 6 because BIDMAS is the rule thing. 

Answer: A
