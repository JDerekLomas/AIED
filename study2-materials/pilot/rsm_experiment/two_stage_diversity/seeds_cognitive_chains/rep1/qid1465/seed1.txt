3 - 5 + 4 x 2

Umm ok so first 3 - 5 = 2.
Wait no it's -2 because the 5 is bigger.

-2 + 4 = 2
2 x 2 = 4

Wait I forgot about BIDMAS. My teacher says you have to do the multiplying bit first. 
B - Brackets (none)
I - Indices (none)
D/M - Divide or Multiply
A/S - Add or Subtract

So 4 x 2 = 8.
Then it's 3 - 5 + 8.

3 - 5 is -2.
-2 + 8...
~~-2 + 8 = -10~~ No that's not right. If I'm at -2 on the number line and go up 8... 
-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So it's 6.
