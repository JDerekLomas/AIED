3 - 5 + 4 x 2

Okay so first you do the plus part... no wait BIDMAS.

Multiplication comes first so $4 \times 2 = 8$

Now it is $3 - 5 + 8$

Um, $3 - 5$ is 2... no it's -2. 

So $-2 + 8$

$\cancel{-2 + 8 = -10}$ 

Wait, if I'm at -2 on the number line and I go up 8...
-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

It's 6.
