3-5 is -2
then add 4 makes it 2
and times 2...
~~2 x 2 = 4~~

Wait, my teacher said something about BIDMAS? Or is it BODMAS? 
You have to do the multiplying first I think.

$4 \times 2 = 8$

Then the rest:
$3 - 5 + 8$

$3 - 5$ is hard. Um. 3 subtract 5 is 2. No, -2.

So $-2 + 8$

$-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$

It's 6.

Final Answer: A
