Umm okay... so BIDMAS.
B - brackets
I - indices
D - division
M - multiplication
A - addition
S - subtraction

**Problem P: 4 - 5 + 6**
A is addition and S is subtraction. A comes before S in BIDMAS, so I should do the adding bit first.
So $5 + 6$ is what I do first.
Wait, if I do $5 + 6 = 11$, then it's $4 - 11$.
~~4 - 11 = -7~~
Actually, if I just go left to right, $4 - 5 = -1$, then $-1 + 6 = 5$.
But the rule says A then S... so $5 + 6$ first?

**Problem Q: 4 + 5 x 6**
Multiplication is definitely before addition. M is before A.
So I do $5 \times 6$ first.
$5 \times 6 = 30$
Then $4 + 30 = 34$.
If I did it the other way $4 + 5 = 9$, then $9 \times 6 = 54$, but that feels wrong because BIDMAS.

So for Q it's $5 \times 6$.
For P, since Addition is before Subtraction in the name BIDMAS, I'll go with $5+6$.

~~Actually, maybe I should just go left to right for P?~~ No, the teacher said follow the letters. Addition then Subtraction.
