Right, BIDMAS... I remember this.

Problem P: $4 - 5 + 6$
B... I... D... M... A... S.
Addition comes before Subtraction. So I have to do the plus bit first. 
$5 + 6 = 11$.
Then it's $4 - 11$.
Wait, is it $4 - 5$ first? Usually you just go across? 
No, the teacher said BIDMAS is the rule. A for Addition, then S for Subtraction. So $5 + 6$ must be first.

Problem Q: $4 + 5 \times 6$
Multiplication is M. Addition is A.
M comes before A. 
So I have to do $5 \times 6$ first.
~~$5 \times 6 = 35$~~
$5 \times 6 = 30$. 
Then $4 + 30 = 34$. 

So for P it's $5 + 6$ and for Q it's $5 \times 6$.

Looking at the options...
A is wrong. 
B has $4 - 5$. 
C has $4 + 5$ for Q which is definitely wrong because of BIDMAS.
D has $5 + 6$ for P and $5 \times 6$ for Q. That matches what I thought.

Answer: D
