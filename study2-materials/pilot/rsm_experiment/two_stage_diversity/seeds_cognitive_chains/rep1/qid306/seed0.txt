Okay, so BODMAS... BIDMAS? My teacher says BIDMAS.

Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.

For Problem P: $4 - 5 + 6$
Additon comes before subtraction in BIDMAS (A then S). So I have to do the plus bit first?
$5 + 6 = 11$
Then $4 - 11$. 
Wait, if I do $4-5$ first I get $-1$, then $-1+6 = 5$. 
But the rule says Add then Subtract. So I'll go with $5+6$ first because it's further right? No, because A is before S.

For Problem Q: $4 + 5 \times 6$
This one is easier. Multiply (M) is definitely before Addition (A).
So I have to do $5 \times 6 = 30$. 
$4 + 30 = 34$.
If I did $4+5$ first it would be $9 \times 6 = 54$ which feels wrong.
So $5 \times 6$ is definitely the first bit for Q.

Back to P... 
BIDMAS... 
B
I
D
M
**A**ddition
**S**ubtraction
So I should do $5+6$ first. 

~~A) P: 4-5, Q: 4+5~~ - No, Q is wrong.
B) P: 4-5, Q: 5x6
C) P: 5+6, Q: 4+5 - No.
D) P: 5+6, Q: 5x6

Actually, I always just go left to right for the easy ones, but the rule says Addition first. Let me look at the options again. If I follow the letter order exactly, P must be $5+6$.

Final Answer: D
