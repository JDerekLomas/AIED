Umm okay so.

Problem P is 4 - 5 + 6.
I remember BIDMAS. 
B - Brackets
I - Indices
D - Division
M - Multiplication
A - Addition
S - Subtraction

In P we have minus and plus. A comes before S in BIDMAS so I should do the plus first?
So that would be 5 + 6 = 11.
Then 4 - 11? That seems hard because 4 is smaller. 
Wait, if I just go left to right, 4 minus 5 is -1. Then -1 + 6 is 5. 
Usually you just go in order for plus and minus? Our teacher said something about that. But A is before S in the name.
Let's look at P again. If I do 5 + 6 first, that's D or maybe C?

Problem Q is 4 + 5 x 6.
This one is definitely BIDMAS. Multiplication comes before Addition (M before A).
So I have to do 5 x 6 first.
5 x 6 is 30.
Then 4 + 30 = 34.
If I did 4 + 5 first it would be 9 x 6 which is 54. But you always do the times first.
So for Q it's definitely 5 x 6.

Back to P... 4 - 5 + 6.
If I follow BIDMAS strictly, A comes first, so 5 + 6.
But 5 + 6 is 11, then 4 - 11 is -7.
If I do 4 - 5 first, it's -1, plus 6 is 5.
Wait, let me look at the options. 
Option D says 5 + 6 and then 5 x 6. 
Option B says 4 - 5 and then 5 x 6.
I think for plus and minus you just go from the left to the right, even though A is before S in the word. Otherwise it gets confusing with the take-away.

So 4 - 5 first for the first one.
And 5 x 6 first for the second one.

Is it B or D? 
Actually, I'll go with D because BIDMAS says Addition then Subtraction. 
Wait no, I’ll stick with 4-5 because it's at the start. 
Let me check Q again... definitely 5x6. 
Okay, I'll go for B because you just do the first bit of the first one.

Working:
P: 4-5 = -1, -1+6=5
Q: 5x6 = 30, 4+30=34

Choice: B
