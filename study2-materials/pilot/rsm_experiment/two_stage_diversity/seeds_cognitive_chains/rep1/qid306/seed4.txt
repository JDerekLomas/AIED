Right, BIDMAS. I remember this.

Problem P: $4 - 5 + 6$
Wait, is it addition first or subtraction? BIDMAS... B-I-D-M-A-S. Addition comes before Subtraction.
So... do I do $5 + 6$ first? 
~~$5 + 6 = 11$~~
~~$4 - 11 = ...$~~ 
No, that doesn't feel right because the 5 is like a minus 5. 
Wait, our teacher said if it's just plus and minus you just go across? Left to right? 
If I go left to right, it's $4 - 5$ which is $-1$, then $-1 + 6 = 5$.
If I do A first (addition), $5 + 6$ is 11, then $4 - 11 = -7$. 
Umm... let's look at Problem Q.

Problem Q: $4 + 5 \times 6$
BIDMAS definitely says Multiply before Add. M comes before A.
So I have to do $5 \times 6$ first.
$5 \times 6 = 30$.
Then $4 + 30 = 34$.
If I did $4 + 5$ first it would be $9 \times 6$ which is 54. But BIDMAS says multiply. 

Back to Problem P. 
Addition is A, Subtraction is S. A comes first in the word BIDMAS. 
So for P it must be the addition: $5 + 6$.
And for Q it must be the multiplication: $5 \times 6$.

Let me check the options.
A) P: $4-5$, Q: $4+5$
B) P: $4-5$, Q: $5 \times 6$
C) P: $5+6$, Q: $4+5$
D) P: $5+6$, Q: $5 \times 6$

Wait, if I follow BIDMAS exactly as it's spelt, P should be $5 + 6$ which is D. 
But I remember someone saying something about a "tie-break"? 
Actually, I'll stick with BIDMAS order. Addition before Subtraction.

D

**Final Answer: D**
