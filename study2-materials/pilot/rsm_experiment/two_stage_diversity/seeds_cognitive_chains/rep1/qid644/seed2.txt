So, the arrows are pointing at the -1 and the -4. 

I have to multiply them because that's how you expand brackets (FOIL).

Um, okay.

Working:
-1 x -4

~~Wait is it -1 + -4?~~ No, it says multiply.

1 times 4 is 4.

Two minuses make a plus. No, wait, if they are both negative does it stay negative? Like -1 and -4 is -5?
~~-1 - 4 = -5~~ 

Actually, I remember the teacher saying a negative times a negative is a positive. Like two minuses join together to make a plus sign. 

So 1 x 4 = 4 
and - - is + 

So it's +4.

Wait, is it 5? 1 plus 4 is 5. No, multiply. 1 times 4 is definitely 4.

Final Answer: A
