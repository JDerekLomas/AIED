Your working:

So it's (2p - 1) (3p - 4).
The arrows are going from the 1 and the 4.
So I have to do 1 times 4. 

$1 \times 4 = 4$

Wait, is it plus or minus?
There is a minus sign in front of the 1 and a minus in front of the 4.
Um... a minus and a minus make a plus? Yeah, two negatives make a positive.
So $-1 \times -4 = +4$

Wait, let me look at the arrows again. Is she adding them? 
Sometimes you add them when you do the middle part.
$-1 + -4 = -5$

Hmm.
The question says "multiplies" though. "multiplies the two terms".
Okay, so it must be 1 times 4.
$-1 \times -4$
~~$1 \times 4 = 4$~~
Negative times negative is positive.

Answer is A

Final Answer: A
