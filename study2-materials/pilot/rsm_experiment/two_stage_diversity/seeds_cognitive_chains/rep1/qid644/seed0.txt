Your working:

Right, okay... the arrows are on the -1 and the -4.

I need to multiply them together because she's expanding the brackets. 

So it's -1 x -4. 

Um... $1 \times 4$ is 4. 

Is it a minus or a plus? I always forget. Two minuses... if you take away a negative it goes up, so I think they cancel out?

Wait, is it adding? -1 add -4 is -5. 

Let me look at the arrows again. Expanding is multiplying... FOIL. Firsts, Outers, Inners, Lasts. 
These are the "Lasts".

-1 times -4...
~~1 x 4 = 4~~
~~-1 + -4 = -5~~

It's 4. And there are two minuses, so they make a plus.

So it's +4.
