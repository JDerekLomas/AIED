Your working:

So I need to multiply the two bits with the arrows.
The arrows are on the $-1$ and the $-4$.

Wait, do I add them or times them? 
The question says "multiplies" so it's times.

$1 \times 4 = 4$

Now the signs... 
$-1 \times -4$
Uhh, my teacher said two minuses make a plus. Or is it just when you add them?
No, it's definitely a plus. 
$-1 \times -4 = +4$

Let me double check... $\sout{-1 \times -4 = -4}$
Wait, no. A negative times a negative is a positive.
$1 \times 4$ is $4$, and it’s $+$ because they are both minus.

So it's +4. 

(I hope it wasn't supposed to be $4p$ or something... but the arrows are just on the numbers at the end.)

A) +4
