So, the arrows are pointing at the numbers.

First number is -1
Second number is -4

So I need to multiply them together...

1 x 4 = 4

Wait, it's negative one and negative four.
Um... 
~~-1 x -4 = -4~~

Wait no, a minus and a minus makes a plus? 
I always forget this.
If you add them it's -5. But the question says "multiplies".

-1 times -4... 
The 1 times 4 is 4. 
Two minuses make a positive. 

Is it 5? No, that's 1 + 4.
The question says multiplies.

4. 
Plus 4.

Final answer: A
