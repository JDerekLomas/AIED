m times m = m^2
then m times -7 = -7m
-5 times m = -5m

erm..

m^2 - 7m - 5m ... wait is it 5x7 or 5+7?
7+5 is 12 so -12m

now the last bit:
-5 x -7
a minus and a minus make a plus. i think. 
~~35~~ +35?

m^2 - 12m + 35

So m^2 - 12m + 35

The options...
A has -2m so thats wrong.
B is m^2 - 12m + 35. That looks like mine.
C is +12m but its -7 - 5 so must be minus.
D has -35 at the end but its two minuses times together so its plus.

B
