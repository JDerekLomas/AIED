Your working:

Right, okay. $4x + 2y = 10$.
The table says $x$ is 0 for the star.
So I need to put 0 where the $x$ is.

$40 + 2y = 10$ 
Wait, no, it's not forty. It's 4 times 0.
$4 \times 0 = 0$.

So... $0 + 2y = 10$.
That means $2y = 10$.
Umm. $y$ must be $10$ divided by $2$?
$10 \div 2 = 5$.

Let me check that again because 20 is there too and 4 times 5 is 20.
If $x=0$, then $4 \times 0$ is nothing.
Then I have $2y = 10$.
Is it $10 - 2$? No that's 8.
$2 \times 5$ is 10. Yeah.

Wait, $4x + 2y = 10$. 
If it was $4+0 + 2y$, no.
The $x$ is 0, so that part just disappears.
$2y = 10$.
Half of 10 is 5.

~~I think it's A because $4 \times 5 = 20$~~ No, $x$ is 0.

$y = 5$.
