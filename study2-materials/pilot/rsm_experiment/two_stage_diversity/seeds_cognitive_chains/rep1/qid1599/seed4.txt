So $c \div (h+4)$...

Dividing is the same as a fraction line. I remember my teacher saying "divide" just means put one on top of the other.

So its $c$ then a line then $h+4$

Wait is it $h+4$ on the top or the bottom? 
The first one usually goes on top. Like $10 \div 2$ is $10/2 = 5$. So $c$ is on top.

Looking at the options:
A) has $c$ on top and $h+4$ underneath. 
<s>B) has $c+4$ but there isn't a 4 next to the $c$</s>
C) has $c/h + 4$ but the plus 4 is kind of hanging off the end? But in the question the brackets mean the $h$ and $4$ are stuck together. 
D) has $h+4$ on top. 

If I put $c$ on top and $h+4$ on the bottom it looks like A. 

Is it C? No because the bracket means you divide by the whole thing. If it was C there wouldnt be brackets I think.

I'll go with A. It looks the most like a normal fraction.

Answer: A
