So $c \div (h+4)$

Algebra is hard. I remember $c \div$ means you put it as a fraction.

Like $c / h$ ?

The brackets are for the $(h+4)$ part. Does it all go on the bottom?
Maybe it's C? No, C looks like the $+4$ is just stuck on the end of the $c$ and $h$.

$\frac{c}{h} + 4$ -- no, that's not right because of the brackets.

Let's look at the options again.
D has the $h+4$ on the top. 
$c$ is first, so it should be on top.

$A = \frac{c}{h+4}$
$B = \frac{c+4}{h+4}$ --- where did the other 4 come from?? cross that out.

If it was $10 \div 2$ that's $\frac{10}{2}$.
So $c \div$ (something) means the $c$ is the numerator.

Wait, is it A or D? 
I'll go with A because $c$ comes first in the sum.

Final answer: A
