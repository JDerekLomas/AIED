Right, so it's $c$ divided by the bracket.

In algebra we dont really use the $\div$ sign, we use fractions.
Like $10 \div 2$ is $\frac{10}{2}$.

So it must be a fraction.
Top number is $c$
Bottom bit is $h+4$

Let me look at the options...
D has $h+4$ on the top, but the $c$ comes first in the question so it should be on top? 
$\frac{c}{...}$ something.

Wait, does the $+4$ go inside the fraction or outside?
If it's $c \div h + 4$ it would be $\frac{c}{h} + 4$ maybe? 
But there are brackets around the $(h+4)$. 
That means it's all one bit?
So the whole $(h+4)$ goes underneath.

Let's look at B. B has an extra $+4$ on the top? I don't know where that came from, probably just to trick me.
C has the 4 on the end.
A looks like it's got the whole thing under the line.

Um... I'll go with A because the bracket stays together.

Answer: A
