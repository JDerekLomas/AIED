So its asking for algebra rules. 
Ok so divide $c \div (h+4)$. 

I know dividing is basically like a fraction so the $c$ has to go on top. 
Wait, or is it the $h$ part? 

$\frac{c}{h} + 4$ -- no that looks wrong because the brackets mean you do the $h+4$ all together.

So its either A or D.
~~$\frac{h+4}{c}$~~
Usually the first letter goes on top of the fraction line thing. 
$c \div h$ would be $\frac{c}{h}$. 
So $c \div (h+4)$ must be $\frac{c}{h+4}$.

Wait, is it B? No where did the extra $+4$ on the top come from in B? Thats definitely wrong. 
C is $c$ over $h$ then add 4. But the question has brackets around $h+4$.
Brackets mean the bottom bit stays together?

A) $\frac{c}{h+4}$
D) $\frac{h+4}{c}$

I think its A because $c$ is at the start of the sum so it goes first (on top). 

Answer: A
