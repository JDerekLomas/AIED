So $c \div (h+4)$...

Okay so $\div$ means like a fraction, usually we don't use the dots and line symbol anymore because mr lewis says it looks like a baby.

$c$ goes on top i think.
So it could be $\frac{c}{h}$ then plus 4? 
Wait no, the brackets mean they are together.

Is it $c$ divided by $h+4$ or $h+4$ divided by $c$? 
~~D) $\frac{h+4}{c}$~~
No, because the first number in the divide sum goes on the top. I always get that mixed up but if it was $10 \div 2$ that would be $5$ which is $10/2$. So $c$ is definitely the numerator.

So its either A or C.
A is $\frac{c}{h+4}$
C is $\frac{c}{h}+4$

The bracket is $(h+4)$ so that whole bit has to be under the line because we have to do that part. If i do C it looks like just the $h$ is under the $c$ but then the $4$ is just extra. 

Actually i'll go with A because the bar acts like the bracket.

Final answer: A
