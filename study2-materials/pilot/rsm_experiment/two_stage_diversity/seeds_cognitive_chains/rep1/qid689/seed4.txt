\( 10=\frac{5}{p} \)

Hmm. Fractions are hard. I need to get the $p$ on its own.
To move the 5, maybe I multiply?

$10 \times 5 = p$
$50 = p$

Wait, no that's not right because the $p$ is on the bottom. If I multiply by 5 I get $50 = \frac{25}{p}$? No.

Let's try again.
$10 = \frac{5}{p}$

Maybe I swap them?
$p = 10 \div 5$
$p = 2$

Let me check that. $10 = \frac{5}{2}$. 
$5$ divided by $2$ is $2.5$.
So $10 = 2.5$... that doesn't make sense. $2.5$ isn't $10$.

Let's try the other way.
$10 p = 5$
Divide by $10$
$p = \frac{5}{10}$
$p = 0.5$

Is it $0.5$ or $50$?
$10 = \frac{5}{0.5}$
How many halves go into 5? $0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5$... that's $10$. 
Yeah, that works.
