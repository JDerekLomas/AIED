\( 10=\frac{5}{p} \)

Hmm, ok. To get the $p$ on its own I need to move the 5. 
So do I multiply by 5?
$10 \times 5 = 50$
$p = 50$

Wait, no, the $p$ is on the bottom. If I multiply by 5 it would be $\frac{25}{p}$ which doesn't seem right.
Let's try moving the $p$ instead. 
$10p = 5$

Now I need $p$ by itself so I divide by 10.
~~$p = 10 \div 5$~~
Wait, is it $10 \div 5$ or $5 \div 10$?
I think it's $10 / 5$ because that's 2.
$p = 2$

Let me check. If $p$ is 2, then $\frac{5}{2}$... wait $\frac{5}{2}$ is 2.5.
But the answer is supposed to be 10. That's wrong.

Go back.
$10p = 5$
Divide both sides by 10.
$p = \frac{5}{10}$
5 divided by 10 is 0.5. 

Let me check that. $\frac{5}{0.5}$. How many 0.5s go into 5?
$0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5$.
That's 10. 
Yeah, that works.

Answer: A) \( p=0.5 \)
