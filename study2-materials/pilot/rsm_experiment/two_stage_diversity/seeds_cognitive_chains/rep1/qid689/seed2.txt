\( 10=\frac{5}{p} \)

Hmm. Fractions are hard. I need to get $p$ on its own. 

Maybe multiply by 5?
~~$50 = p$~~  Wait, no, the 5 is on the top. 

If I move the $p$ up, I do $10 \times p = 5$. 
So $10p = 5$. 

Now divide by 10 to get $p$.
$p = 10 \div 5$ 
$p = 2$

Wait, let me check that. 
If $p=2$, then $5 \div 2$ is... $2.5$.
But the question says it equals 10. So $p=2$ is wrong.

Let me try again. 
$10 = 5/p$
If I have 5 and I want to get 10, I have to divide it by something small.
$10p = 5$
$p = 5 / 10$
$5$ divided by $10$ is $0.5$ because $5$ is half of $10$.

Let's check $p = 0.5$
$5 \div 0.5$ ... how many halves go into 5?
$0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5$
That's 10.
Yeah, that works.

Answer: A) p=0.5
