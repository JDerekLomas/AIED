\( 10 = \frac{5}{p} \)

Hmm. I need to get $p$ on its own.
Normally you move the bottom number by multiplying?

$10 \times 5 = p$
So $50 = p$?

Wait, that looks wrong. If $p$ is $50$, then $5 \div 50$ is a tiny number, not $10$.

Let me try again.
$10 = 5 \div p$
~~$10p = 5$~~  (Is that right? yeah you multiply by $p$ to get it off the bottom)

$10p = 5$
Now divide by $10$ to get $p$.
$p = 10 \div 5$
$p = 2$

Hold on. $5 \div 10$ or $10 \div 5$?
$10p = 5$
So $p = \frac{5}{10}$

$\frac{5}{10}$ is the same as $1/2$.
$1/2$ is $0.5$.

Let me check. $5$ divided by $0.5$.
How many halves go into $5$? $2, 4, 6, 8, 10$. Yeah, it's $10$.

Answer is A.
