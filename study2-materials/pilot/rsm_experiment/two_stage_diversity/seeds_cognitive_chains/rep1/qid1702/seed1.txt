Your working:

$10x - 6y = 30$

The table says $y = 0.5$ and I need to find $x$ (the star).

So... $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$

$6 \times 0.5$... half of 6 is 3.

$10x - 3 = 30$

Now I need to move the 3 over. 
$10x = 30 - 3$ 
~~$10x = 27$~~
Wait, it's minus 3 on that side so it becomes plus on the other side? 
$10x = 30 + 3$
$10x = 33$

Now divide by 10.
$x = 33 \div 10$
Is that 3.03? No, move the decimal point one place...
$x = 3.3$

Checking the list. 3.3 is there. 

A) 4.25
B) -4.25
C) 3.3
D) 2.7

Answer: C
