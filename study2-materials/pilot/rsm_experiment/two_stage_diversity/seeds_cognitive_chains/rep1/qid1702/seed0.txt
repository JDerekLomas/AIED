Your working:

Right, so I need to find the star which is $x$. 
They give me $y = 0.5$.

Equation is $10x - 6y = 30$.

Substitute the $y$:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$

$6 \times 0.5$... that's half of 6 which is 3.

So $10x - 3 = 30$.

Now I need to move the 3 to the other side.
I think I subtract it?
No, it's already minus so I plus it.

$10x = 30 - 3$ 
Wait, no. 
$10x = 30 + 3$
$10x = 33$

Now find $x$.
$x = 33 / 10$

Um, 33 divided by 10. You just move the decimal point.
Is it 0.33? 
No, 33 is bigger than 10.
It’s 3.3.

Let me double check the 6 times 0.5 again. 
$6 \times 5 = 30$ so $6 \times 0.5$ is 3. Yeah that's right.
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$

Wait, did I do the sign right?
If it was $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10 \times 3.3$ is 33.
$33 - 3 = 30$.
Yeah, that works.

Looking at the options...
A is 4.25
B is -4.25
C is 3.3
D is 2.7

It’s C.

Answer: C
