Your working:

Right, okay. $10x - 6y = 30$.

The table has $y$ as $0.5$ and I need to find $x$.

So $10x - 6 \times 0.5 = 30$

$6 \times 0.5$ is half of $6$ which is $3$. 
~~$10x - 3 = 30$~~

Wait, is it plus or minus? The equation is minus.
So $10x - 3 = 30$.

I need to get $x$ by itself.
I'll move the $3$ over. Since it’s minus $3$, it becomes plus $3$ on the other side.
$10x = 30 + 3$
$10x = 33$

Now I divide by $10$.
$x = 33 \div 10$

Um, $33$ divided by $10$ is... move the decimal point once.
$3.3$

Wait, let me double check. If $x$ is $3.3$ then $10 \times 3.3 = 33$.
And $33$ minus $3$ is $30$.
Yeah, that works. 

Looking at the options:
A) 4.25
B) -4.25
C) 3.3
D) 2.7

It's C.

Final Answer: C
