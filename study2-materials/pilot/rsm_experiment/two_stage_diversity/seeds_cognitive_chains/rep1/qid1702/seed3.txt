Your working:

Equation: $10x - 6y = 30$

The table says $y = 0.5$ so I need to put that into the $y$ bit.

$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$

Um, $6 \times 0.5$. Half of $6$ is $3$.
So $10x - 3 = 30$

Now move the $3$ over.
Wait, do I add or subtract? It's minus on that side so it becomes plus.
$10x = 30 - 3$
No, $10x = 30 + 3$
$10x = 33$

To find $x$ I do $33 \div 10$.
$33$ divided by $10$ is $3.3$

Wait let me check if I was supposed to take it away. 
$10x = 27$
$27 \div 10 = 2.7$

Actually, it says $- 6y$ so it should be $30 + 3$ because you do the opposite.
So $33$.
$33 / 10 = 3.3$

Final Answer: C
