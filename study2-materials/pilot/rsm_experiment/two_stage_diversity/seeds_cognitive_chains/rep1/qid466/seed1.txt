So, I need to find the star thing.

$$-\frac{3}{4} \times \text{something} = -1$$

Okay, so it’s a multiplication. To get 1, you usually just flip the fraction upside down? Because like, 3 on top and 3 on bottom cancel out. 

$$\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{12}{12} = 1$$

But the question has minuses. Um... there is a minus in front of the 3/4 and a minus on the 1.
If I have a minus times a minus, that makes a plus.
Wait.
$- \times - = +$
But the answer needs to be $-1$.
So if I use a negative number for the star, the answer would be $+1$.
So it has to be a positive number? 

Let me try again.
$-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3}$
The minus stays there because the 4/3 is positive.
So it’s $-\frac{12}{12}$ which is $-1$.
Yeah, that works.

Wait, let me look at the options.
A) $4/3$
B) $-4/3$
If I pick B, it would be $-\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{4}{3} = +1$. That's wrong because it needs to be $-1$.
So it's A. 

I think. Or is it C? No, 3/4 times 3/4 is 9/16, that's not 1.
It's definitely the flipped one. 

Answer: A
