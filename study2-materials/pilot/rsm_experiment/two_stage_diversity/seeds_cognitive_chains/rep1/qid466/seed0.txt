So, $-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$.

Okay, I need to find the number that makes it $-1$.
If I multiply by a fraction, it usually gets smaller. 

Wait, the answer is negative, and the first bit is negative. 
Negative times a negative equals a positive. No, that's wrong.
$-$ times $+$ is $-$. So the star must be a positive number? 
I think so. That means it's not B or D.

So is it $\frac{3}{4}$ or $\frac{4}{3}$?

Let's try $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4}$.
$3 \times 3 = 9$
$4 \times 4 = 16$
$\frac{9}{16}$ ... that doesn't equal 1. 

Maybe I just flip it? Like a reciprocal? 
I remember my teacher saying something about flipping fractions to get 1.
$\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3}$
$3 \times 4 = 12$
$4 \times 3 = 12$
$\frac{12}{12} = 1$

Wait, if I have $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3}$, does that make $-1$?
$- \times + = -$
Yes. 
So it must be $\frac{4}{3}$.

Hold on, let me check the signs again.
If I put $\frac{4}{3}$, the minus stays there, so $-1$. 
If I put $-\frac{4}{3}$, two minuses make a plus, so that would be $+1$.
The question asks for $-1$. 
So I don't need another minus.

Answer is A.

A) $\frac{4}{3}$
