$-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$

Okay so I need to find the number that goes there.
The answer is -1, and the first number is a minus.
If I do a minus times a plus it stays minus.
So...
-3/4 times something = -1

Maybe I just flip it?
4/3
Wait, 3/4 $\times$ 4/3 
$3 \times 4 = 12$
$4 \times 3 = 12$
$12/12 = 1$
So $-3/4 \times 4/3 = -1$

Let me double check the signs because I always get them wrong.
- times + = -
Yes. 
If it was B (-4/3) then it would be - times - which is +1.
But the question says -1.

So it must be the positive one.

Is it 4/3?
A is 4/3
B is -4/3

If the star is 4/3 then:
$-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -\frac{12}{12} = -1$

Yeah, that looks right. I'll go with A.

Final Answer: A
