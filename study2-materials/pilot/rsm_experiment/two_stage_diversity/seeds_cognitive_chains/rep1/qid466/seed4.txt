So, I need to find the star thing.

$$-\frac{3}{4} \times \text{something} = -1$$

Okay, if it was like $2 \times x = 1$, then $x$ would be $0.5$, which is a half. So it's a flip? I remember the teacher saying something about flipping the fraction to get 1. 

The fraction is $\frac{3}{4}$, so the flip is $\frac{4}{3}$. 

But there's a minus sign. 
Um... $- \times -$ makes a plus.
But the answer is $-1$. 

Wait.
If I do $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3}$... 
The 3s cancel out and the 4s cancel out. 
That leaves 1.
And there's one minus sign, so it stays negative?
Let me check: $(-0.75) \times (1.33)$... yeah, that sounds like it could be $-1$.

If I chose B ($-\frac{4}{3}$), then it would be $-\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{4}{3}$. 
Two minuses make a plus. So that would be $+1$.
But the question says $-1$.

So I think it has to be a positive number so the minus sign doesn't go away.

Working:
$-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -\frac{12}{12} = -1$

~~I'll go with B~~ No, wait. 
B is negative. 
If I use B: $(-) \times (-) = (+)$
But I want $-1$.
So the star must be positive.
The positive flip is $\frac{4}{3}$.

A is $\frac{4}{3}$

Answer: A
