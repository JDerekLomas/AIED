$-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$

Okay, so I need to find the star. 
Usually if you multiply something to get 1, it's the flipped fraction? Like $2 \times \frac{1}{2} = 1$. 

So the flip of $\frac{3}{4}$ is $\frac{4}{3}$. 

But it's negative.
Wait, if I do $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3}$...
The 3s cancel out and the 4s cancel out. 
$-1 \times 1 = -1$.

Wait let me double check. 
$-\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{4}{3}$
Negative times negative is a positive. 
$- \times - = +$ 
So that would be $+1$.
But the question says the answer is $-1$.

So I need the star to be positive so the minus stays there? 
~~$-\frac{4}{3}$~~ 
If I use A, which is $\frac{4}{3}$:
$-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -\frac{12}{12} = -1$

Yeah, that works. 
Wait, is it B? No, two minuses make a plus and I want it to stay as minus one.

Answer: A
