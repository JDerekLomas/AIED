**Your working:**

Right, let’s look at this. 
Equation is $15 = \frac{1+k}{4}$

Step 1:
He has $60 = 1 + k$
Um... he must have moved the 4.
$15 \times 4$
$15, 30, 45, 60$. 
Yeah, so $60 = 1+k$ seems right because you multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the dividey bit. 
Step 1 is correct.

Step 2:
$61 = k$
Wait. If $60 = 1 + k$...
To get $k$ on its own, you have to move the 1.
It's a plus 1, so you do the opposite? 
~~$60 + 1 = 61$~~
No, wait. If I have $60 = 1 + k$, then $k$ must be 59?
Because $59 + 1$ is $60$.
Isaac put $61$. 
He probably did $60 + 1$ instead of $60 - 1$. I always do that. 

So Step 1 is fine, but Step 2 is definitely wrong.
Let me double check... $15 \times 4$... $10 \times 4 = 40$, $5 \times 4 = 20$... $40+20=60$. Yeah.
And $61 + 1$ would be $62$, not $60$. So $61$ is wrong.

A) Only step 1
