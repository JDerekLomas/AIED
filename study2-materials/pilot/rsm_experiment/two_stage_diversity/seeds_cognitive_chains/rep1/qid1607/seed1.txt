So, looking at the equation:
$15 = \frac{1+k}{4}$

Step 1:
He has 60 on the left side. He must have done $15 \times 4$.
If you move the 4 from the bottom of the fraction to the other side, it becomes a times, right?
$15 \times 4 = 60$
Yeah, 15, 30, 45, 60. That's right.
So $60 = 1 + k$.
Step 1 looks okay.

Step 2:
Now he has $61 = k$.
Wait, how did he get that? 
To get $k$ on its own, you have to move the 1.
It says $1+k$, so you do the opposite of plus which is take away?
$60 - 1 = 59$
But Isaac got 61. He probably added it instead of taking it away.
~~$60 + 1 = 61$~~ -> that's what he did.
But he should have minus'd it.
So Step 2 is wrong.

Let me just check Step 1 again...
15 times 4... 15, 30, 45, 60. Yes.
And the top bit is $1+k$. So $60 = 1+k$ is correct.
Step 2 should be $k = 59$. 
So Isaac messed up the second bit.

Answer is A.
