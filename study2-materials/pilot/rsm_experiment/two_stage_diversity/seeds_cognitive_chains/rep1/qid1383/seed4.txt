So, T = k to the power of 4.
k is -3.

So it’s $-3 \times 4$? No, wait, power of 4 means you multiply it by itself four times.
$-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$

$3 \times 3 = 9$
$9 \times 3 = 21$ no, $27$.
$27 \times 3 =$ ... 
$20 \times 3 = 60$
$7 \times 3 = 21$
So $60 + 21 = 81$.

Now the signs... 
$-3 \times -3 = 9$ (minus and minus makes a plus)
Then $9 \times -3 = -27$
Then $-27 \times -3 =$ 
Two minuses make a plus again.
Wait, let me check. 
$-$ 
$+$ 
$-$ 
$+$
Yeah, it ends up positive.

But I remember my teacher saying something about negatives stay negative if it's in a bracket? Or is it if there's no bracket?
$-3^4$
If I do $-3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$ it's $-81$.
If it's $(-3)^4$ it's $81$.

The question just says $k = -3$ so I'll just put it in. 
$T = -3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$
I think it's 81. 
Actually, maybe it is -81 because it starts with a minus? 
Let me stick with 81.
