So we have $k = -3$.
$T = k^4$
This means $k$ times itself 4 times.

Wait, is it $3 \times 4$?
No, that's $12$. $3+3+3+3$ is $12$.
It's powers, so $-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$

$-3 \times -3 = 9$ (minus and minus is a plus)
Then $9 \times -3 = -27$
Then $-27 \times -3$...
$20 \times 3 = 60$
$7 \times 3 = 21$
$60 + 21 = 81$

So it's either $81$ or $-81$.
Wait, $-27 \times -3$... there are two minuses again. 
$- \times - = +$
I think it stays positive because it's an even number? I remember my teacher saying something about even powers.
Actually, if it's $-3$ inside the brackets... $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$
$-3 \times -3$ is $9$
$-3 \times -3$ is $9$
$9 \times 9 = 81$

But wait, sometimes it stays negative if you just put it in the calculator?
$T = -3^4$
If I do $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$ it's $81$.
But there's a minus sign there. 

Let's go with $81$ because the minuses cancel out.

Final Answer: A
