Here is my working for this question:

x / 3 - 5 = 12

First I need to move the -5 to the other side to get x on its own.
So it becomes + 5.
12 + 5 = 17.
So Tom says x / 3 = 17. That looks right to me.

Now for Katie. 
She says x - 5 = 36.
She got 36 because 12 times 3 is 36. 
Wait, if you multiply the whole thing by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
(x / 3) * 3 = x
12 * 3 = 36
So x - 5 = 36.

Let me double check.
~~If x/3 = 17 then x = 17 x 3~~
17 x 3... 10x3 is 30, 7x3 is 21. So 51.
If x is 51, then 51 / 3 is 17. 17 - 5 = 12. 
So Tom is definitely right.

If I use Katie's way:
x - 5 = 36
x = 36 + 5 = 41.
But I just said x should be 51?
Let me look at Katie's again. 
x / 3 - 5 = 12
If she multiplied by 3, she has to multiply *everything* by 3.
So it should be x - 15 = 36.
She forgot to multiply the 5 by 3! She just did the x/3 and the 12. 
So Katie's line is wrong. 

Only Tom's next step works because he just did the +5 bit first which is easier.

Final Answer: A
