Here is my working for this question:

$\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$

To get rid of the -5, you have to do the opposite which is +5.
So, $12 + 5 = 17$
Tom's line is $\frac{x}{3} = 17$ which looks right because he moved the 5 over.

Now Katie... 
She has $x - 5 = 36$.
I think she timesed everything by 3 to get rid of the fraction.
$12 \times 3 = 36$ (used my fingers for this, 12, 24, 36)
So $\frac{x}{3} \times 3 = x$
And $12 \times 3 = 36$
Wait, if you multiply by 3 you have to do it to all the bits. 
Does she need to do $5 \times 3$ as well?
~~$5 \times 3 = 15$~~
If she did it to the whole side it would be $x - 15 = 36$.
But she just kept the 5. 
Wait, maybe you only multiply the end? 

Actually, Tom's one is definitely how my teacher showed us. You always move the plus or minus bit first. Katie's one looks a bit weird because the 5 is still there but the 3 is gone. I think you have to do the 5 as well if you do that.

So Tom is right.
Wait, let me check. If $\frac{x}{3} = 17$ then $x = 17 \times 3$. 
$10 \times 3 = 30$
$7 \times 3 = 21$
So $x = 51$.
If I put 51 in Katie's one: $51 - 5 = 46$... not 36. 
So Katie is wrong.

Answer: A
