Here is my working:

x/3 - 5 = 12

Okay, so for Tom:
He wants to move the -5 to the other side.
To move a minus you have to add it. 
So 12 + 5... 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
So x/3 = 17. 
That looks right because you do the opposite of minus which is plus.

Now Katie:
She has x - 5 = 36. 
I think she multiplied by 3?
~~3 times 12 is 36.~~ 
If you multiply the whole thing by 3 to get rid of the fraction... 
3 times x/3 is just x. 
And 3 times 12 is 36.
But wait, what about the 5? 
If you multiply by 3, you have to do it to everything?
I think she forgot to multiply the 5 by 3 as well. 
If she did it properly it should be x - 15 = 36? 
So I don't think Katie is right because she just left the 5 alone.

Wait, let me look at Tom again. 
If he adds 5 first, he doesn't have to multiply yet. That's easier.
I'll go with Tom.
