Here is how a typical Year 9 student might approach this:

x/3 - 5 = 12

I hate fractions. Ok, to get rid of the -5 I need to do the opposite which is +5.
So, 12 + 5 = 17.
That means x/3 = 17.
Tom looks right because he did the +5 first. 

Now let me look at Katie. She has x - 5 = 36. 
To get 36 she must have done 12 times 3. 
Wait, if you multiply the 12 by 3 to get rid of the divide by 3... then you have to multiply everything by 3? 
If I multiply by 3, the /3 disappears from the x.
So it becomes x. 
But she kept it as - 5. 
Wait, if I have x/3 - 5 and I multiply it by 3, does it only change the x?
~~3x/3 - 15~~
If I multiply by 3 then the 5 should become 15.
Katie wrote -5. She forgot to multiply the 5 by 3. 
She only multiplied the 12. 
Actually... let me re-read. Tom did 12+5 = 17. That makes sense.
Katie got 36. She definitely did 12 x 3.
If she multiplied by 3, the whole side needs to be times 3. 
(x/3 - 5) * 3 = 36
x - 15 = 36
So Katie is wrong because she should have changed the 5 to a 15.

Wait, is it okay to do the +5 first? 
Yes, because if I add 5 to both sides it gets rid of it on the left.
So Tom is definitely right. 

Answer: A) Only Tom
