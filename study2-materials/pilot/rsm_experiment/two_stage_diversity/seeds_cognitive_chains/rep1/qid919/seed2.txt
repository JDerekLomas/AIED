So, $y = 3x^2$. 

The number for $x$ is 0.3.

So I need to do 3 times 0.3 and then square it. 

Wait, or is it square the 0.3 first? BODMAS says indices before multiplying... so yeah, square first.

$0.3 \times 0.3$

$3 \times 3$ is 9.
Since there's a decimal, it's 0.9? 
No, 0.3 is smaller than 1, so $0.3 \times 0.3$ must be $0.09$ (I think you move the point twice).

So $y = 3 \times 0.09$

~~3 times 9 is 27.~~

If it's $3 \times 0.09$...
$3 \times 9 = 27$
Put the decimal back in... 0.27

Let me double check if I was supposed to do $3 \times 0.3$ first.
$3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$
$0.9 \times 0.9 = 0.81$

Hmm, both 0.27 and 0.81 are there. I'll stick with 0.27 because the squared bit only goes on the $x$ usually.
