So, $y = 3x^2$. 
$x$ is $0.3$. 

Step 1: 
Square it first? Bidmas says indices. 
$0.3^2 = 0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$
Wait, no. 
$0.3^2$ is $0.3 \times 0.3$. 
$3 \times 3$ is $9$, so $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$. 

Step 2:
Times by 3. 
$y = 3 \times 0.09$. 
$3 \times 9$ is $27$. 
So $0.27$? 

Let me check if I do the $3 \times 0.3$ first.
$3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$
Then square it... $0.9 \times 0.9 = 0.81$.

Wait, $3x^2$ is $3(x)^2$ not $(3x)^2$. 
So it's $3 \times (0.3 \times 0.3)$. 
$0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.9$. No, $0.09$. 
$3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

$3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ 
$0.9 \times 2$ is $1.8$? No.
Is it D? $2.7$? 
$3 \times 3 = 9$. 
Maybe I just do $3 \times 0.3$ and then... no.

If $x$ was $3$: $3 \times 3^2 = 3 \times 9 = 27$.
But it is $0.3$. 
So the answer must have a $27$ in it.
$0.27$ or $2.7$. 
$0.3$ is small, so $0.3$ squared is $0.09$. 
$3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.
