So, $y = 3x^2$

The table says $x$ is 0.3, so I need to put that into the formula.

$y = 3 \times 0.3^2$

Wait, do I do the $3 \times 0.3$ first or the squared first? BIDMAS... Brackets, Indices... so the squared comes first.

$0.3^2$ is the same as $0.3 \times 0.3$.
$3 \times 3 = 9$.
Since there are two numbers after the decimal point, it must be 0.09.

No, wait, is it 0.9? 
$0.3 + 0.3$ is 0.6... no, that's adding. 
$0.3 \times 0.3$ is 0.09. Yeah.

So now I do $3 \times 0.09$.
$3 \times 9 = 27$
So $3 \times 0.09$ is 0.27.

Let me check that again.
If I did $3 \times 0.3$ first, that would be 0.9.
Then $0.9^2$ is $0.9 \times 0.9 = 0.81$. 
That's one of the options (A). 

But I'm pretty sure squared comes before the times 3.
So $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$
$0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$

Wait, let me look at the options. 
A is 0.81
B is 0.27
C is 1.8
D is 2.7

If I accidentally did $3 \times 0.3 \times 2$ (like times by the power instead of squaring), I would get $0.9 \times 2 = 1.8$. That's option C.

I think it's 0.27.

Final Answer: B
