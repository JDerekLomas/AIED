3 / 2x + 4 / x

The bottoms (denominators?) are different so i need to make them the same. 
To get x to be 2x, i just times it by 2.

3 / 2x + (4 x 2) / 2x

wait if i do it to the bottom i have to do it to the top.

3 / 2x + 8 / 2x

So 3 + 8 = 11

The bottom part is 2x + 2x... no you dont add the bottoms. 
It stays as 2x.

~~11 / 4x~~
11 / 2x

I think it's A. 

Wait, I also thought maybe just adding the tops and the bottoms?
3+4 = 7
2x+x = 3x
7 / 3x?

No, Mrs Higgins said you need a common denominator. So it must be the 2x one. 

A) 11 / 2x
