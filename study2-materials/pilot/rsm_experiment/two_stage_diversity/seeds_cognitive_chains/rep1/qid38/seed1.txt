3 / 2x + 4 / x

To add fractions the bottoms (denominator??) need to be the same.
So it is 3 + 4 = 7. 
Wait, the bottom bits are 2x and x. 

I need to make the second one have a 2.
4 / x   x2
4 x 2 = 8
x x 2 = 2x

So it's 3 / 2x + 8 / 2x
~~3 + 8 = 11~~
~~2x + 2x = 4x~~ 

No, you dont add the bottom numbers when you add fractions. Like 1/4 + 1/4 is 2/4 not 2/8.

3 / 2x + 8 / 2x
3 + 8 is 11.
Bottom stays as 2x.

11 / 2x
