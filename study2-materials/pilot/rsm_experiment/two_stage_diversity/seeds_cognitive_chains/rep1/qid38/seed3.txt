3 / 2x + 4 / x

To add fractions you need the same bottom number.
So i'll do 3 + 4 = 7
and 2x + x = 3x?

Wait no, the denominators have to be the same. 
The first one is 2x and the second one is x.
I can times the second one by 2 to make it 2x.

~~4/x  x 2 = 8/x~~   No, 8/2x. 

So now it is:
3 / 2x + 8 / 2x

Then you just add the top bits.
3 + 8 = 11

So the answer is 11 / 2x + 2x... no you dont add the bottom bits once they are the same.
It stays as 2x.

11 / 2x
