3 / 2x + 4 / x

To add fractions the bottoms (denominator??) need to be the same.
So i'll do 2x times x? No thats too big.

If I make them both 2x then the first one stays as 3 / 2x.

For the second one 4 / x ... to get 2x on the bottom I need to times it by 2.
So i do 4 times 2 = 8.
And x times 2 = 2x.
So it's 8 / 2x.

Now add them:
3 / 2x + 8 / 2x = 11 / 4x

Wait, when you add fractions you don't add the bottoms.
My teacher says the denominator stays the same.

3 + 8 = 11
The bottom stays as 2x.

11 / 2x

Is that one of the options?
A is 11/2x
B is 7/3x -- thats if you just add 3+4 and 2x+x but thats wrong.
D is 7/2x -- wait i thought it was 7/2x for a second because 3+4=7. But the x has to be the same.

Working:
3 / 2x + 8 / 2x = 11 / 2x
