First I add the big numbers.
$2 + 2 = 4$

Now the fractions.
$\frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4}$

I need the same bottom number. Is it 14? No, you times them. $10 \times 4 = 40$.

Wait, maybe 20 is better. Let's do 40 it's easier to just multiply.

$\frac{7 \times 4}{40} = \frac{28}{40}$
$\frac{1 \times 10}{40} = \frac{10}{40}$

Add them up $\frac{28+10}{40} = \frac{38}{40}$

So it is $4 \frac{38}{40}$

Is that one of the ones? No. I need to simplify it.
Divide by 2.
$38 \div 2 = 19$
$40 \div 2 = 20$

So $4 \frac{19}{20}$

~~Check the other way~~
If I did improper fractions...
$\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4}$
$\frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$

The question asks for a mixed number though. $99 \div 20$... $20, 40, 60, 80$. That's 4 and 19 left over.

$4 \frac{19}{20}$

Answer: B
