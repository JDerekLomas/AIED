2 + 2 = 4

7/10 + 1/4... i need the bottom numbers to be the same. 
common denominator = 40? 
no wait 20 is smaller but 40 is easier.

7/10 = 14/40 (x4)  - wait, 7 x 4 is 7, 14, 21, 28.
so 28/40.

1/4 = 10/40.

28/40 + 10/40 = 38/40.

so the whole thing is 4 38/40.
it's not one of the options.

ummmm maybe i just add the tops and add the bottoms?
7+1 = 8
10+4 = 14
so 4 8/14? 
That is option D.

Wait, the teacher said dont add the bottoms. I have to find the proper denominator.
20 is better.
10 goes into 20 twice. 7 x 2 = 14.  (14/20)
4 goes into 20 five times. 1 x 5 = 5. (5/20)

14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20.

So it is 4 and 19/20. 
Check options... B is 4 19/20. 

A is 99/20 but that's a top-heavy fraction. Let me check if 4 19/20 is the same as 99/20.
4 times 20 is 80.
80 plus 19 is 99.
So 99/20.

Wait, it says "Leave your answer as a mixed number". 
A is a top-heavy fraction. B is a mixed number.

Final answer is B.
