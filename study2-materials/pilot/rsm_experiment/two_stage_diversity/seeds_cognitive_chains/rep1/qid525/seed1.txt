2 + 2 = 4

so I need to add the fractions now. 7/10 + 1/4.
The bottom numbers are different so I'll just add them? No, miss said find a common denominator. 

10, 20, 30...
4, 8, 12, 16, 20...
it's 20.

7/10 = 14/20 (doubled it)
1/4 = 1/20  ~~no wait~~  4 goes into 20 five times. 
So 1 x 5 = 5. 
It is 5/20.

14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20.

So it's 4 and 19/20. 

Wait, let me double check the big numbers. 2 + 2 is definitely 4.
~~7/10 + 1/4 = 8/14~~  no thats wrong, can't just add the top and bottom. 

Looking at the options:
A is a big fraction
B is 4 19/20 - that matches mine.
C is a fraction
D is 4 8/14 - that's what you get if you just add the numbers across. I almost did that lol. 

Is 4 19/20 the same as 99/20?
4 times 20 is 80.
80 plus 19 is 99. 
Oh, they are the same thing? But the question asks for a mixed number. 
So it's B.

Answer: B
