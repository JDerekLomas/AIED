To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are.

Numbers are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7

Sum = $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$
$1+3=4$
$4+4=8$
$8+7=15$

There are ~~4~~ 5 numbers because you have to count the zero as well? 
$1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ numbers.
So its $15 \div 5 = 3$

Looking at the options:
A) $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ — this has the 5 at the bottom which is right, but they forgot the 0 at the top. Wait, does $0$ change the plus? $15+0$ is still 15. So that looks okay.

B) $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$ — this looks like the right sums but my teacher says if you type it like that in a calculator it only divides the last number. BIDMAS or something? So probably not that one.

C) $\frac{1+3+4+7}{4}$ — there are 5 numbers, not 4. So this is wrong.

D) None of them.

If I do $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ it's the same as $\frac{15}{5}$. The 0 doesn't add anything so maybe you can just leave it out of the top bit? Yeah, A looks the most like a mean calculation.

Answer: A
