To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are.

So it’s $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$.
$1 + 3 = 4$
$4 + 4 = 8$
$8 + 7 = 15$
The zero doesn’t really change the total sum.

Now I need to divide by how many numbers.
There is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 numbers. 
Wait, do I count the zero? I think so. 
So it's $15 \div 5 = 3$.

Let me look at the choices:
A) $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ — This has a 5 on the bottom which is right but it missed the 0 at the top. But adding 0 doesn't do anything to the sum... $\frac{15}{5}$ is 3.

B) $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$ — This looks okay but if I type it into my calculator like that it will only divide the 7 by 5 because of BIDMAS. 

C) $\frac{1+3+4+7}{4}$ — This is dividing by 4. I should divide by 5 because there's five numbers.

If I look at A again, $1+3+4+7$ is 15. And $15 \div 5$ is 3. The 0 doesn't add anything to the top so it’s the same thing as having $0+1+3+4+7$.

Wait, B is $0+1+3+4+ \dots$ actually no, that's not it.

A has the right total and the right amount of numbers to divide by.

Final answer: A
