To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are.

Numbers are 0, 1, 3, 4, 7.

So $0+1+3+4+7$. 
$1+3 = 4$
$4+4=8$
$8+7=15$

There are 1, 2, 3, 4 numbers? No, wait, 5 numbers because you have to count the zero as well.
So I need to divide by 5.

Looking at the options:
A is $(1+3+4+7) / 5$
B is $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$

Wait, B looks right because it has all the numbers, but when you type that in a calculator it only divides the 7 by 5 because of BIDMAS. We did this in class. You need the whole top part added up first. 

Wait, is it A?
A is missing the zero. $1+3+4+7$ is 15.
If I do the sum with the zero, it's $0+1+3+4+7$ which is still 15. 
So the top of A is right. And there are 5 numbers, so dividing by 5 is right. 

But C has a 4 at the bottom. Some people might think it's 4 numbers because 0 doesn't count, but my teacher said 0 is a value. 

So it's either A or B. 
B doesn't have brackets or a line, so it's probably wrong. 
A has the 5 at the bottom. It doesn't have the 0 at the top but adding 0 doesn't change anything anyway. 

~~I'll go with B~~
Actually A looks more like how you write a mean.

Answer: A
