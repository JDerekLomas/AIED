To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are.

Numbers are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
Count = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 numbers.

Sum = $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$
$1+3 = 4$
$4+4 = 8$
$8+7 = 15$

So it's $15 \div 5$.

Looking at the options:
A has $1+3+4+7$ on the top. That's $15$. And it's divided by $5$.
Wait, the $0$ is missing from the top in A?
$0+1+3+4+7 = 15$
$1+3+4+7 = 15$
Adding zero doesn't change the sum so it's the same thing.

B says $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. But if you put that in a calculator you have to do the division first (BODMAS) so it would be $7 \div 5$ then add the rest. That's wrong.

C is divided by 4. There are 5 numbers because 0 counts as a number in the list. So it's not 4. 

Wait, if I do $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ it's the same as $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$. 
Zero doesn't add anything to the total.

The answer is A.
