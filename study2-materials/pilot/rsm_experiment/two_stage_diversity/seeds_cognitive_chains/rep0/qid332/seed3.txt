Here is my working for this question:

x/3 - 5 = 12

Okay, so I need to get $x$ by itself. 

Tom says $x/3 = 17$. 
He has moved the minus 5 to the other side. When you move a minus, it becomes a plus. 
$12 + 5 = 17$. 
So $x/3 = 17$. This looks right because he did the opposite of minus.

Now Katie. 
Katie says $x - 5 = 36$.
She multiplied by 3. $12 \times 3 = 36$.
But wait, if you multiply by 3, you have to multiply everything by 3?
$3 \times (x/3)$ is $x$.
But $3 \times 5$ is 15. 
So it should be $x - 15 = 36$ maybe? 
~~Katie forgot to multiply the 5~~
She only did the 12 and the $x/3$. 

I'll check Tom again. 
$x/3 = 17$
$x = 17 \times 3$
$10 \times 3 = 30$, $7 \times 3 = 21$. So $x = 51$.
Let's check $x = 51$ in the start. 
$51 \div 3 = 17$.
$17 - 5 = 12$. 
Yes, that works!

Katie's one:
$x - 5 = 36$
$x = 41$
Check: $41 \div 3$ ... that's a decimal. $13.66...$
$13.66 - 5$ is not 12. 

So Tom is definitely right. Katie forgot to multiply the 5 by 3, you have to do it to the whole side. 

Wait, can I just check... 
Actually, maybe Katie is right too? No, she didn't multiply the middle bit.

Answer: A

A) Only Tom
