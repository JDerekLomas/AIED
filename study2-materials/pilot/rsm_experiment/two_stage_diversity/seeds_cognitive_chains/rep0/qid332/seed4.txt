Here is my working for this:

First, look at Tom’s way:
x/3 - 5 = 12
I need to move the -5 to the other side to get x by itself.
When you move a minus, it becomes a plus. 
So 12 + 5 = 17.
That makes sense, so Tom's line is $x/3 = 17$. 
Wait, if $x/3 = 17$, then $x = 17 \times 3$ ... $10 \times 3 = 30$, $7 \times 3 = 21$, so $x = 51$.

Now look at Katie’s way:
x/3 - 5 = 12
She wants to get rid of the divide by 3 first. 
To get rid of a divide, you multiply everything by 3.
$12 \times 3 = 36$
So $x - 5 = 36$
Wait... she multiplied the 12 but she didn't multiply the -5. My teacher said if you multiply by the bottom number you have to do it to everything in the row. 
Actually, maybe she's right because the 3 is only under the $x$?
$\frac{x}{3} \times 3$ is $x$.
$12 \times 3 = 36$.
If she did that, the equation should be $x - 15 = 36$ because $5 \times 3 = 15$. 
So Katie missed out the 5. She didn't times the 5 by 3.

Let me check Tom again.
x/3 - 5 = 12
+ 5 on both sides.
$x/3 = 17$. 
This looks like the normal way we do it in class. You move the number without a letter first. 

So Tom is definitely right.
Katie's one feels wrong because you can't just ignore the 5 when you multiply by 3.
