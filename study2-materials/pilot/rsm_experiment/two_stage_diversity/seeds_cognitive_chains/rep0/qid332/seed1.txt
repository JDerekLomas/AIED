Here is my working out for the question:

x / 3 - 5 = 12

I need to get x on its own. 

**Tom's way:**
If you have -5, you move it to the other side and it becomes +5.
So, x / 3 = 12 + 5
x / 3 = 17.
This looks right because 12 plus 5 is definitely 17. So Tom is correct.

**Katie's way:**
She has x - 5 = 36. 
She multiplied by 3? 
12 times 3 is 36. 
Wait, if you multiply the whole thing by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3 times (x/3) is x. 
3 times 12 is 36.
But what about the 5? 
If I multiply by 3, do I multiply the 5 as well? 
Um. 3 x 5 is 15. 
So it should be x - 15 = 36? 
Let me re-read... "a correct next line". 
If she only multiplied the x/3 and the 12, she forgot the middle bit.
Wait, let me try solving it again.
x / 3 = 17
x = 17 * 3
10 * 3 = 30
7 * 3 = 21
x = 51.

If I use Katie's: x - 5 = 36
x = 36 + 5 = 41. 
51 is not 41. 
So Katie must be wrong because she didn't multiply the 5 by 3. You have to do the same thing to everything, I think. Or you just move the 5 first like Tom did. Tom's way is much easier and it makes sense. 

Actually, wait. Did Tom do it right?
x/3 - 5 = 12
Add 5 to both sides... 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. 
Yeah, x/3 = 17 is fine.

Katie just multiplied the 12 by 3 and the x/3 by 3 but left the 5 alone. That feels like a mistake my teacher always circles in red.

So only Tom.
