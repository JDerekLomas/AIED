So, $T = k^4$ and $k$ is $-3$.

I need to do $-3$ times itself $4$ times.

Working:
$-3 \times 4 = -12$

Wait, no, that's $k \times 4$. The little number means power.

So it's $-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$

$3 \times 3$ is $9$.
Then $9 \times 3 = 27$
And $27 \times 3$...
$20 \times 3 = 60$
$7 \times 3 = 21$
$60 + 21 = 81$

Now I need to check the minus sign.
A minus and a minus make a plus.
$-3 \times -3 = 9$
$9 \times -3 = -27$
$-27 \times -3 =$ ...there is another minus, so it stays negative?

Actually, $-27 \times -3$
The two minuses cancel out?
So $- \times - = +$
$-27 \times -3 = 81$

But there were four minuses.
$-$ and $-$ is $+$
$-$ and $-$ is $+$
So it must be plus 81.

Wait, I did one where the power was odd and it stayed minus. This is even.
I think it's $81$.

Let me check the options.
$81$ is A.
$-81$ is C.

I'll go with C just in case because the $k$ was negative to start with and normally it stays negative in these questions. No, wait, $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$ is definitely $81$. I'll stick with $81$.

Answer: A
