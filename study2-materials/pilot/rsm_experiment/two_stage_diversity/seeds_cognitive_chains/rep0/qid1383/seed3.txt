So, T = k to the power of 4.
k is -3.

So it’s $-3^4$

That means $-3 \times 4$? No, wait, power means you times it by itself.
$-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$

Okay.
$3 \times 3$ is 9.
$9 \times 3$ is 27.
$27 \times 3$... er... 20, 40, 60... 7 \times 3 is 21... so 81.

Now is it positive or negative?
A minus and a minus makes a plus. 
$-3 \times -3 = 9$
$9 \times -3 = -27$
$-27 \times -3 = $ 

Ummm. Two minuses make a plus? Or is it because the power is 4? 
Wait, I remember my teacher saying something about negatives in brackets.

$-3 \times -3$ is 9
Then $9 \times -3$ is -27
Then $-27 \times -3$... 
The signs cancel out I think.

Actually, is it $3 \times 4 = 12$? No, that's too simple. 

I'll go with -81 because it's a negative number to start with?
Actually, wait, $(-3) \times (-3)$ is positive 9. 
Positive $9 \times (-3)$ is -27. 
Negative $-27 \times (-3)$ must be positive 81.

Wait, looking at the options... I'm not sure if it stays negative. I'll pick C just in case. No, wait, let me look again. 

$(-3)^4$ 
$-3, 9, -27, 81$.
I'll go with 81. 

Final Answer: A
