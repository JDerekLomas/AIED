So we have $T = k^4$ and $k$ is -3.

Wait, does $k^4$ mean $k \times 4$ or $k$ times itself? I think it's power of 4. 

So it's $-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$ 
Let's see...
$3 \times 3$ is 9
$9 \times 3 = 27$
$27 \times 3 = ...$ 
$20 \times 3 = 60$
$7 \times 3 = 21$
$60 + 21 = 81$

But there is a minus sign. 
So $-3 \times -3$ makes +9 (because two minuses make a plus).
Then $9 \times -3$ is -27.
Then $-27 \times -3$ ... 

Wait, if I have four minuses...
$- \times - = +$
$+ \times - = -$
$- \times - = +$
So it should be positive? 

Let me re-read the question. $T = k^4$. 
$-3^4$
~~$3 \times 4 = 12$~~ (no, that's not it)

If $k$ is -3, maybe it stays negative? Like, the minus is at the front? 
$-(3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3) = -81$.

I'm not sure if the minus is inside or outside the bracket. My teacher said something about this but I can't remember. Most of the time when there is a minus and a power, the answer ends up negative in my tests.

Let me go with -81.

Final answer: C
