Volume of a sphere... I remember this.
Formula is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^2$  $\leftarrow$ no wait, its 3D so its $r^3$
$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$

Need to get $r$ by itself.
Times by 3 first?
$3V = 4\pi r^3$

Now move the $4\pi$.
$\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$

To get $r$ I need to square root it. No, it's a 3 so it's a cube root.
$r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$

Wait let me check the options.
A is $4V\pi / 3$... no.
B is $4V / 3\pi$... almost.
C is $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$
D has the $\sqrt{}$ just on the $V$ which looks wrong.

The 3 goes on top and the $4\pi$ goes on the bottom because you divide by them.

Answer: C
