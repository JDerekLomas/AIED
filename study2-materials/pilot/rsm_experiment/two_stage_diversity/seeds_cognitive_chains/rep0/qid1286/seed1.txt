Volume of a sphere... I remember this.
$V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^2$  <-- wait, no, it's a sphere so it must be cubed.
$V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$

Need to find $r$.
First, move the $\frac{4}{3}$ to the other side.
Divide by 4/3 is same as multiplying by 3/4? 
So $V \times \frac{3}{4} = \pi r^3$
$\frac{3V}{4} = \pi r^3$

Now get rid of the $\pi$.
It's times on that side, so move it down to the bottom.
$\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$

Now I need $r$ on its own.
Opposite of cubed is square root. No, cube root.
$r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$

Looking at the options:
A is $4V\pi / 3$ (upside down)
B is $4V / 3\pi$ (also upside down?)
C is $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$ - this looks like mine.
D is different, the $\sqrt$ is only on the V.

Wait, did I do the fraction bit right?
$V = 4/3 \dots$
$3V = 4 \dots$
$3V / 4 = \dots$
Yeah, 3 goes to the top.

Answer: C
