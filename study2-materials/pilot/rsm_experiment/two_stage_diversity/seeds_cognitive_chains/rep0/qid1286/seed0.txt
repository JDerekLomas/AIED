Volume of a sphere = $\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$ (I think? check notes... yeah thats right)

So, $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$

I need to get $r$ on its own.
First move the 3.
$3V = 4 \pi r^3$

Now move the 4 and the $\pi$.
$\frac{3V}{4} \pi = r^3$  wait, no, the $\pi$ is on top so it goes to the bottom.

$\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$

To get $r$ i need the opposite of cubed which is square root? 
No, cube root. The little 3 one.
$\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}} = r$

Looking at the options...
A has $4V$ on top.
B has $4V$ on top.
C looks like mine. 
D has a big 3 at the front.

C.

Answer: C
