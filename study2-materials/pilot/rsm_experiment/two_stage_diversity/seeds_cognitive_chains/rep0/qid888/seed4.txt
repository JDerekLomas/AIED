Right, so multiply the brackets. $(m-5)(m-7)$.

I remember the FOIL thing. First, Outside, Inside, Last.

First: $m \times m = m^2$
Outside: $m \times -7 = -7m$
Inside: $-5 \times m = -5m$
Last: $-5 \times -7$

Um, $5 \times 7$ is 35. It’s two negatives so... $-5 \times -7 = -35$ wait, no, two minuses make a plus. So it's $+35$.

So I have: $m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35$

Now I need to simplify the middle bit.
$-7 - 5$
If I’m at minus 7 on the number line and I go back 5...
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
So $-12m$.

Wait, let me re-check the signs because I always mess them up.
$m^2$
$-7m$
$-5m$
$+35$

So $m^2 - 12m + 35$.

Looking at the options:
A is $-2m$ (that's if you did $7-5$)
B is $m^2 - 12m + 35$
C is $+12m$
D is $-35$ at the end.

Actually, I almost picked D because I thought it might be minus 35, but $-5 \times -7$ is definitely plus 35. 

Answer: B
