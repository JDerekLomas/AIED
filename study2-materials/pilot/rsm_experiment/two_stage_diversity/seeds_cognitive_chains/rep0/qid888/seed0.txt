Right, brackets. We have to do the FOIL thing my teacher said.

Firsts: $m \times m = m^2$
Outers: $m \times -7 = -7m$
Inners: $-5 \times m = -5m$
Lasts: $-5 \times -7 = \dots$

Um, 5 times 7 is 35. 
Since they are both minuses, is it minus?
$-5 \times -7 = -35$ 
No, wait, two negatives make a plus. I think. 
So $+35$.

So I have:
$m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35$

Now combine the middle bits.
$-7 - 5 = \dots$
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. 
It's $-2$? 
No, that's if it was $-7 + 5$.
If I'm at minus 7 and I go down 5 more, that's $-12$.

$m^2 - 12m + 35$

Let me look at the choices.
A has $-2m$ so that's wrong.
B is $m^2 - 12m + 35$
C is $m^2 + 12m + 35$
D is $m^2 - 12m - 35$

B and D are similar. I'm pretty sure $-5 \times -7$ is positive because the signs are the same.

Answer: B
