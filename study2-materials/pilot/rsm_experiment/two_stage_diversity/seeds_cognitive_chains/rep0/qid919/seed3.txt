So, $y = 3x^2$

The $x$ is 0.3, so I need to put that in the formula.

$3 \times 0.3^2$

Wait, do I do 3 times 0.3 first or the square thing first?
BODMAS... indices comes first. So $0.3^2$

$0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$
No wait, 3 times 3 is 9, so it must be 0.9. 
Actually, 0.3 is small so $0.3 \times 0.3$ is 0.09. 

Now I need to do 3 times that.
$3 \times 0.09$

$3 \times 9 = 27$
So it's 2.7?

Wait, let me check the other way.
If I did $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$
Then $0.9^2 = 0.9 \times 0.9 = 0.81$ (that's option A).

But the squared is only on the $x$ isn't it? So it's $3(0.3^2)$.
$3 \times 0.09$
$0.09 + 0.09 + 0.09 = 0.27$

Hold on, I have 0.27 and 2.7 as options.
$3 \times 9$ is 27.
The point... it's 0.09 so two spaces back.
0.27.

Let me just double check $0.3 \times 0.3$.
3/10 times 3/10 is 9/100.
Yeah, 0.09.
$3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.
