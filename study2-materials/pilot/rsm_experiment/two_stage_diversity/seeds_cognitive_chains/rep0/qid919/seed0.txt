So $y=3x^2$. 

The table says $x = 0.3$. 

So $y = 3 \times 0.3^2$. 

First I need to do the $3 \times 0.3$ part first? No, BIDMAS says powers first.

$0.3 \times 0.3$ 
$3 \times 3 = 9$ 
So $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ (Wait, or is it $0.09$? Um. One decimal place... two decimal places... yeah $0.09$)

Now $3 \times 0.09$

~~$3 \times 9 = 18, 27$~~ 
$3 \times 9 = 27$

If $3 \times 9 = 27$, then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

Let me check if I do the $3x$ first by mistake... $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then $0.9^2$ is $0.81$. That is option A.
But BIDMAS says Indices then Multiply.

$0.3^2 = 0.09$
$0.09 + 0.09 + 0.09 = 0.27$

Wait, if I just did $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and forgot the squared bit? No, that's not an option.

It's B or D... $0.27$ or $2.7$. 
$0.3$ is small, so $0.3 \times 0.3$ should be even smaller. $0.09$ makes sense.
$3$ times $0.09$ is definitely $0.27$.

Answer: B
