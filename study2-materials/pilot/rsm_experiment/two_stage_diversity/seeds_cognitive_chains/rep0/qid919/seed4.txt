So $x$ is $0.3$ and I need to find $y$.
The equation is $y = 3x^2$

Step 1:
Do I do $3 \times 0.3$ first?
No, it's powers first because of BIDMAS. 
So it is $(0.3)^2$ 

$0.3 \times 0.3 = \dots$
$3 \times 3 = 9$
So $0.3 \times 0.3$ must be $0.9$. Wait, no.
There are two numbers after the decimal point if you do $0.3 \times 0.3$.
So it’s $0.09$. 

Step 2:
Now I need to multiply by 3.
$y = 3 \times 0.09$
$3 \times 9 = 27$
So $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$

Wait, looking at the options. 
If I did $3 \times 0.3$ first that’s $0.9$, then $0.9^2$ is $0.81$ (that's A).
If I did $3 \times (0.3 \times 3)$ that's $2.7$ (that's D).
Let me re-check.
$0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$. 
$0.09 + 0.09 + 0.09 = 0.27$.

Yes, $0.27$ is option B.

Answer: B
