So $y = 3x^2$ and $x$ is 0.3.

So it’s $3 \times 0.3^2$.

0.3 squared... that's $0.3 \times 0.3$. 
$3 \times 3 = 9$. 
But there's two numbers after the decimal? Or is it just one?
If it was $3 \times 3$ it's 9. 
0.3 squared is ~~0.9~~ 0.09. 

Wait, so $y = 3 \times 0.09$. 
$3 \times 9$ is 27.
I need the decimal points back.
$0.09 + 0.09 + 0.09 = 0.27$.

Let me just double check if it's $(3x)^2$ because I always get mixed up. 
No, the square is only on the $x$. 
So $3 \times (0.3 \times 0.3) = 3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$? 

Wait, $0.3 \times 0.3$ is 0.09, I already said that. 
So $3 \times 0.09$ is 0.27. 

Is it $0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$ or $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$?
I'll go with 0.27 because $3 \times 3$ is 9 but it's small decimals.

B) 0.27
