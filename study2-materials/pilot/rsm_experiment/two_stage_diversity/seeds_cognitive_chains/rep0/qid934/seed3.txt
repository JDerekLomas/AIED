Okay, so I need to find the star for when $x$ is 0.

The equation is $4x + 2y = 10$.

So I put 0 where the $x$ is.
$40 + 2y = 10$
No, wait, that's not right. It's 4 times 0. 

$4(0) + 2y = 10$
$0 + 2y = 10$

So $2y = 10$.
Now I need to get $y$.
Um, I think I have to take the 2 away? 
$10 - 2 = 8$
Wait, no, it's 2 times $y$. 
So $y = 10 \div 2$.
$10 \div 2$ is... 5.

Let me just check if it's the other way round... if I did $4 + 2$ is $6$ then $10 - 6$ is $4$... no that doesn't make sense.
If $x$ is 0 then $4x$ is just gone. 
$2y = 10$
Half of 10 is 5.

The options are 20, 3, 5, 2.5. 
5 is there. 
Is it 2.5? $10 \div 4$? No, that's if $y$ was 0. 
So it's 5.
