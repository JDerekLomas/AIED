Okay so the table has x and y and x is 0 for the star one.

The equation is $4x + 2y = 10$.

So I need to put the 0 where the x is.
$40 + 2y = 10$  no wait, it's not forty, it's $4 \times 0$.

$4 \times 0 = 4$
Wait... $4 \times 0$ is 0. 

So $0 + 2y = 10$
$2y = 10$

Now I have to find y.
To get y on its own I think I take away 2? 
$10 - 2 = 8$
Wait, that's not one of the answers.

Let me try again. 
$2y = 10$
That means 2 times something is 10.
$2 \times 5 = 10$
So $y = 5$.

Let me just check the x = 1 one to be sure...
If $x$ is 1, then $4(1) + 2y = 10$
$4 + 2y = 10$
$2y = 6$
$y = 3$. 
Yeah, that makes sense. 

So for $x = 0$, $y$ is 5.
