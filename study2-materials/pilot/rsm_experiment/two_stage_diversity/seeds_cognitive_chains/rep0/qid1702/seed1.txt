Your working:

Right, okay... I need to find the $x$ bit (the $\bigstar$).
So they gave me $y = 0.5$.

The equation is $10x - 6y = 30$

Substitute the $0.5$ in.
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$

Wait, what's $6$ times $0.5$?
$6 \times 5 = 30$ so it must be $3$.
$10x - 3 = 30$

Now I need to move the $3$.
Do I take it away? No, it's minus so I plus it.
$10x = 30 - 3$ 
No, wait. $10x = 30 + 3$
$10x = 33$

Okay, so $x = \frac{33}{10}$

Is that $3.3$ or $0.33$?
$33 \div 10$... decimal point moves one space.
It's $3.3$

Wait, let me double check the minus thing.
$10x - 3 = 30$
If $x$ is $3.3$, then $10 \times 3.3 = 33$.
$33 - 3 = 30$.
Yeah, that works.

Check the options...
A) $4.25$
B) $-4.25$
C) $3.3$
D) $2.7$

It's C.

Answer: C
