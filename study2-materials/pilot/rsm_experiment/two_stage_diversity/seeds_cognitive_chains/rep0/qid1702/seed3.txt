Your working:

Right, so I need to find the star which is $x$.
They told me $y = 0.5$ and the equation is $10x - 6y = 30$.

So... $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$

$0.5$ of $6$ is $3$. No wait, is it $3$ or $30$?
$6 \times 0.5$... that's half of $6$ so it's $3$.

So $10x - 3 = 30$

Now I move the $3$ over there.
$10x = 30 - 3$ 
~~$10x = 27$~~

Wait, when you move a minus it becomes a plus doesn't it?
$10x = 30 + 3$
$10x = 33$

Now I need $x$, so I divide by $10$.
$x = 33 \div 10$

$33$ divided by $10$ is... $3.3$?
Let me check that. $10 \times 3 = 30$ so $33 \div 10 = 3.3$.

Wait, let me look at the options. 
A) $4.25$
B) $-4.25$
C) $3.3$
D) $2.7$

If I did $30 - 3$ it would be $27$ and $27 \div 10$ is $2.7$ which is D. 
But I'm pretty sure you add it if it's minus on the other side.
I'll go with $3.3$.

Answer: C
