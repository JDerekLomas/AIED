Your working:

$10x - 6y = 30$

The table says $y = 0.5$, so I need to put that in the equation.

$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$

Wait, $6 \times 0.5$ is half of 6, which is 3.

$10x - 3 = 30$

Now I need to move the 3 to the other side.
I think I do $30 - 3$ because it's minus on the left.
~~$10x = 27$~~
No, wait. It's opposite signs, right? Change the side, change the sign. So it should be plus.

$10x = 30 + 3$
$10x = 33$

Now I need $x$. 
$x = 33 \div 10$

$33$ divided by $10$ is... just move the decimal point.
$3.3$

Wait, let me check $10x - 3 = 30$ again. 
If $x$ is $3.3$
$10 \times 3.3$ is $33$
$33 - 3 = 30$. 
Yeah, that works. 

Looking at the options:
A) 4.25
B) -4.25
C) 3.3
D) 2.7

It matches C.

Answer: C) 3.3
