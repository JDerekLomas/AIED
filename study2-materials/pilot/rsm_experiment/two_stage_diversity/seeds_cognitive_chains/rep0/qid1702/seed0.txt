Your working:

$10x - 6y = 30$

The table says $y = 0.5$ and I need to find $x$ (the star).

So... $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$

$6 \times 0.5$ is the same as half of 6, so that's 3.

$10x - 3 = 30$

Now I need to move the 3.
$10x = 30 - 3$ 
Wait, no, it's minus on that side so it's plus on the other side.
$10x = 33$

Now divide by 10.
$x = 33 \div 10$

$33 / 10$ is... ~~3.03~~... no, you just move the decimal point once.
$3.3$

Checking the options. 3.3 is C.

Answer: C
