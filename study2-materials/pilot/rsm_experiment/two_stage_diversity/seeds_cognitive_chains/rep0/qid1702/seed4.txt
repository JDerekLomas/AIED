Your working:

Right, okay. So I need to find the $x$ thing.
$10x - 6y = 30$

The table says $y$ is $0.5$, so I put that in for the $y$ part.

$10x - 6 \times 0.5 = 30$

$\times 0.5$ is the same as dividing by $2$, I think.
Half of $6$ is $3$.

So, $10x - 3 = 30$

Now I have to move the $3$ to the other side. 
$\text{Is it minus or plus?}$
Um, if it's minus on this side it goes to plus on the other side.
~~$10x = 30 - 3$~~
$10x = 30 + 3$
$10x = 33$

Now I need to get $x$ by itself.
$x = \frac{33}{10}$

How many $10$s in $33$?
$10, 20, 30...$
That's $3$ and then $3$ left over.
So $3.3$

Wait, let me check the answers. 
$3.3$ is there. $C$ is $3.3$. 

Is that it? 
Let me double check the $6 \times 0.5$ again... yeah half of six is definitely $3$. 
And $30 + 3$ is $33$. 
$33 \div 10 = 3.3$

Seems okay.

Answer: C
