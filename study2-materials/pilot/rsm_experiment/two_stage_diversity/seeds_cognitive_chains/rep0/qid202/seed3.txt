So, I need to add these two numbers together.

$2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5}$

First, I’ll add the big numbers at the front.
$2 + 1 = 3$

Now the fractions.
$\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}$
Um... you have to add the top and the bottom, right? No, wait, my teacher said something about the bottom stays the same if they match.
$1 + 2 = 3$
$5 + 5 = 10$  <-- *no wait, crossing that out*

Maybe I should change them into those top-heavy fractions first to be safe.
$2 \times 5 = 10$ plus $1 = \frac{11}{5}$
$1 \times 5 = 5$ plus $2 = \frac{7}{5}$

$\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{10}$
Wait, $11 + 7$ is $18$. Do I add the $5$ and the $5$? 
If it's $18$ over $10$... that looks like one of the answers. 

Let me look at the options. 
A is $3 \frac{3}{5}$. 
If I just did $2+1=3$ and $\frac{1+2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$... then it's $3 \frac{3}{5}$. 
But $11+7=18$ and if I add the bottom it's $\frac{18}{10}$ which is C. 

Wait, if I have a fifth of a pizza and someone gives me two more fifths, I have three fifths. So the bottom shouldn't change. 
So it's $3 \frac{3}{5}$. 

Let me check A and B. $3 \frac{3}{5}$ is the same as $\frac{18}{5}$ (because $3 \times 5 = 15, +3 = 18$).
The question says leave it as a mixed number. 
So it's A. 

Answer: A
