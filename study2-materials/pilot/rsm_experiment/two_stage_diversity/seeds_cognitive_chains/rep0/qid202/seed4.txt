So, first you have to add the big numbers.
2 + 1 = 3

Then the fractions are 1/5 and 2/5. 
So 1 + 2 = 3.

But what do I do with the bottom numbers? I think I add them as well. 
5 + 5 = 10. 

Wait, or is it just 5? 
If I have 1/5 and 2/5... um... 

~~1/5 + 2/5 = 3/10~~

No, the teacher said the bottom stays the same if they are the same?
So 1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5.

Let me check again.
The whole part is 3. 
The fraction part is 3/5.

So it's 3 3/5.

Is that A? 
B is 18/5. If I do 3 x 5 = 15... plus 3 is 18... so it could be B too? 
But the question says "mixed number", so it has to have the big number at the front. 18/5 is a top-heavy one.

I'll go with A. 

Answer: A
