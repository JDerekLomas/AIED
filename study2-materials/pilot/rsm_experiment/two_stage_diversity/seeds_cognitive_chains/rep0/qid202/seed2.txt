So, for this one... 

2 and 1/5 plus 1 and 2/5. 

First I'll do the big numbers:
$2 + 1 = 3$

Now the fractions part:
$1/5 + 2/5$

Um, do I add the bottom numbers? 
~~$1/5 + 2/5 = 3/10$~~
Wait, no, my teacher says you keep the bottom one the same if they are already the same.

So $1 + 2 = 3$ and then keep the $5$. 
So that is $3/5$.

Now put it back together:
$3$ and $3/5$

Looking at the options...
A is $3 \frac{3}{5}$
B is $18/5$... let me check that... $3 \times 5$ is 15... $16, 17, 18$... oh, $18/5$ is the same thing. But the question says mixed number.

I almost picked D because I thought about $5+5=10$ for a second, but it's A.

Your working:
$2+1 = 3$
$1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5$
Answer = $3 \frac{3}{5}$

A) $3 \frac{3}{5}$
