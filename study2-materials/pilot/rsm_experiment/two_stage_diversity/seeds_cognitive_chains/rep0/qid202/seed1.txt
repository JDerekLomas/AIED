So, adding fractions. 

$2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5}$

First, do the big numbers:
$2 + 1 = 3$

Now the fraction bits:
$\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{10}$

Wait, no, you don't add the bottom numbers do you? I always forget. If it's a 5 and a 5 then the answer is... 

$\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$

So it's $3 \frac{3}{5}$ 

Let me just check $\frac{18}{5}$ though because maybe I have to change it to improper first. 
$2 \times 5$ is $10$, plus $1$ is $11$. So $\frac{11}{5}$.
$1 \times 5$ is $5$, plus $2$ is $7$. So $\frac{7}{5}$.
$11 + 7 = 18$
So $\frac{18}{5}$. 

Is that the same? $18 \div 5$... $5, 10, 15$... that's 3 and then $16, 17, 18$ makes 3 left over. 
$3 \frac{3}{5}$

Okay so it's A. I almost chose D because I thought I had to add the 5s at the bottom to get 10. 

A) $3 \frac{3}{5}$
