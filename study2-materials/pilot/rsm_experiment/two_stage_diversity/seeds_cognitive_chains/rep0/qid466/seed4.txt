Okay so the question is... $- \frac{3}{4} \times \text{something} = -1$.

Right. I know that if you times a fraction by its flip... thing... it equals 1.
So like $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{12}{12}$ which is 1.

But there's minus signs here. 
Wait, a minus times a minus is a plus? Yeah, I think that's right.
So if I have $-\frac{3}{4}$ and I want it to equal $-1$ in the end...
If I times by a minus number, it would go to $+1$.
So $-\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{4}{3} = + \frac{12}{12} = +1$.
But the question says $-1$.

Ugh. Let me look at the options.
If I pick A ($\frac{4}{3}$):
$-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -\frac{12}{12} = -1$. 
Wait, that looks like it works. One minus and one plus stays minus.

Let me just check B because usually these ones have more minuses. 
$-\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{4}{3}$... no, that's definitely positive 1. I need it to stay negative.

Wait, is it just $\frac{3}{4}$? No, that doesn't make sense.
$\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4}$ is like $\frac{9}{16}$. Not that.

Okay, let's look again. 
$-\frac{3}{4} \times \text{star} = -1$
If I ignore the minuses: $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = 1$.
The question has a minus on both sides.
$-\frac{3}{4} \times$ ~~$-\frac{4}{3}$~~ no. 
$- (0.75) \times (something) = -1$.

If I do $\frac{4}{3}$, the minus stays there because there's only one. 
Yeah. 
$-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1$.

Final answer is A.
