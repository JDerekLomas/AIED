So, its $-3/4$ times something to get $-1$.

To get 1 you usually just flip the fraction upside down... like the reciprocal thing?

$3/4 \times 4/3$
$3 \times 4 = 12$
$4 \times 3 = 12$
$12/12 = 1$

Wait, it has a minus sign.
$-3/4 \times 4/3 = -12/12 = -1$

Does it need to be negative?
If the star is negative: negative times negative is positive.
$-3/4 \times -4/3 = +1$ 
But the answer needs to be $-1$.

So if the first bit is already negative, the star has to be positive so the answer stays negative.
- times + = -

So the star is $4/3$. 

Is it $3/4$? No, $3/4 \times 3/4$ is $9/16$ thats wrong.
I'll go with $4/3$ because it cancels out.
