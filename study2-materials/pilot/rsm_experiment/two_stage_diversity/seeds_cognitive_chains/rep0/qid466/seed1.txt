$-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$

Okay, so I need to find the number that goes there.

The answer is $-1$, and I’m starting with a negative... so minus times a minus is a plus? Wait.
If it's $-\frac{3}{4} \times something = -1$.
A negative times a positive is a negative. So the star has to be positive? 

$\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{12}{12} = 1$

So if I have $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3}$ that would be $-\frac{12}{12}$ which is $-1$. 

Let me check the signs again because I always mess those up. 
$- \times + = -$
Yeah, that works. 
Wait, if I chose B, then $-\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{4}{3}$ would be $+1$. But the question says $-1$.

So it has to be the positive one.

Is it flipping it? Reciprocals.
$3/4$ flipped is $4/3$.

A is $4/3$.
B is $-4/3$.

I'll go with A. 

Answer: A
