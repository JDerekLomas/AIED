Umm okay so.

$-3/4 \times \text{something} = -1$

If I have a fraction, to get it back to 1 you have to flip it. Like $1/2 \times 2 = 1$.
So if I flip $3/4$ it becomes $4/3$.

Wait, it's negative.
$-3/4 \times 4/3$
A negative times a positive is a negative.
So $- \frac{3 \times 4}{4 \times 3} = - \frac{12}{12} = -1$

~~Oh wait does it need to be negative?~~ 
If I use $-4/3$, then minus times minus makes a plus.
But the answer in the question is $-1$. It stays negative.

So I need a positive number to keep the sign the same. 
Minus times plus equals minus. 

So $4/3$. 
Check the list. A is $4/3$. B is $-4/3$.
If I do B: $-3/4 \times -4/3 = +12/12 = 1$. That's wrong because it should be $-1$.
So it's A.

Answer: A
