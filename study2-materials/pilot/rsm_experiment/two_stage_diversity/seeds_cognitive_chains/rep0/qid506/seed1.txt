Your working:

3p = 1/12

I need to get p by itself so I divide by 3.

p = (1/12) / 3

Ummm. Is it 12 times 3 or 12 divided by 3? 
If it was 3p = 12, then p = 4. 

Wait.
p = 1/12 ÷ 3 
This is like 1/12 × 3? No, you flip the second one. 
3 is the same as 3/1. 

So 1/12 × 1/3

1 * 1 = 1
12 * 3 = ~~48~~ 
no 12, 24, 36. 

So p = 1/36

Let me just check if it's 1/4... 
3 * 1/4 = 3/4. That's not 1/12.
3 * 1/36... 3/36... divide both by 3... 1/12. Yeah.

B) p = 1/36
