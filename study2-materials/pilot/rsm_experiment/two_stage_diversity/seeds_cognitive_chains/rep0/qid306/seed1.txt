Problem P: $4 - 5 + 6$
Ok so for bidmas/bodmas i know Addition comes before Subtraction. So i should do the plus bit first. 
$5 + 6 = 11$
Wait, no that doesn't feel right because the minus is there. Is it $4 - 11$? 
~~$4 - 11 = -7$~~
Actually, my teacher said you just go left to right if it's adding and subtracting?
But "A" for addition is definitely before "S" for subtraction in the word. 
Let's look at P again. $4 - 5$ is $-1$, then $+ 6$ is $5$.
If I do $5 + 6$ first I get $11$, then $4 - 11$... 
I'll stick with the BIDMAS rule. Addition is first. So $5 + 6$ is first for P.

Problem Q: $4 + 5 \times 6$
This one is easier because multiply is always before add. 
M is before A.
So $5 \times 6 = 30$
Then $4 + 30 = 34$
So for Q it’s $5 \times 6$ first.

So...
P: $5+6$ first
Q: $5 \times 6$ first
