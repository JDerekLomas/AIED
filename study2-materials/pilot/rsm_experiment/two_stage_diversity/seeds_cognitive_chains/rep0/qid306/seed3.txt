Umm okay so. BIDMAS. I remember we did this in year 7 but I always forget if the A or S comes first. 

Problem P: 4 - 5 + 6
Is it A for Addition first? Or just go across? 
Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.
So... Addition is before Subtraction in the word BIDMAS.
So do 5 + 6 first?
Wait, 4 - 5 is -1. Then -1 + 6 = 5.
If I do the plus bit first: 5 + 6 = 11. Then 4 - 11 = -7. 
Wait, the teacher said you just go left to right if it's just plus and minus. Like a line.
So 4 - 5 first for P? 

Problem Q: 4 + 5 x 6
This one has a times. 
M comes before A in BIDMAS.
~~4 + 5 = 9~~
~~9 x 6 = 54~~ 
No, you have to do the multiply first because of the rule. 
So 5 x 6 has to be first.

So for P, I'll go with the first one on the left because it's easier, and for Q I'll do the times because it's the rule. 

Looking at the options...
P: 4 - 5
Q: 5 x 6

That matches B. 
Actually, I nearly picked D because A comes before S, but usually we just go left to right for plus and minus. I think.

Answer: B
