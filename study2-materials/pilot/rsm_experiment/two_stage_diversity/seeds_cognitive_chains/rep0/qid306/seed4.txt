Okay, so BODMAS. Or BIDMAS? We did this last week. 

Problem P: $4 - 5 + 6$
Usually you just go across, right? So $4 - 5$ is $-1$. Then $-1 + 6 = 5$.
But wait, Addition comes before Subtraction in BIDMAS (B-I-D-M-A-S). So should I do $5 + 6$ first? 
If I do $5 + 6 = 11$, then $4 - 11 = -7$. That's a different answer.
Ugh, I think you're supposed to just go left to right for add and subtract because they're basically the same. So $4-5$ first.

Problem Q: $4 + 5 \times 6$
This one is definitely BIDMAS. Multiplication ($M$) comes before Addition ($A$).
So I shouldn't do $4+5 = 9$. I have to do $5 \times 6$ first.
$5 \times 6 = 30$
Then $30 + 4 = 34$.
If I did $4+5$ first it would be $9 \times 6 = 54$, which feels too big.

Wait, looking at Problem P again. Addition is $A$, Subtraction is $S$. $A$ is before $S$ in the word. 
So do I do $5+6$ first?
No, my teacher said something about them being equal... but $A$ is definitely before $S$. 
Let's look at the options. 
If P is $4-5$ and Q is $5 \times 6$, that's B.
If P is $5+6$ and Q is $5 \times 6$, that's D.

I'll go with the order of the letters because otherwise why is the rule called BIDMAS? $A$ comes before $S$. So $5+6$ first.

~~Problem P: 4-5 first?~~
Problem P: $5+6$ first.
Problem Q: $5 \times 6$ first.

Answer: D
