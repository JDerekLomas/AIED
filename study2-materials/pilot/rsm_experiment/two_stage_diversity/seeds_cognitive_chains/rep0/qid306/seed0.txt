Umm okay so.

Problem P is 4 - 5 + 6. 
For BIDMAS I know B is brackets but there aren't any. I think Add comes before Subtract because it's BIDM**A**S? 
Wait, if I do the add first it's 5 + 6 = 11. Then 4 - 11? No that's not right. 
Usually you just go left to right if it's just take away and plus. So 4 minus 5. That's -1. Then plus 6 is 5. 
So for P it's probably 4 - 5 first.

Problem Q is 4 + 5 x 6. 
Okay, BIDMAS. Multiplication comes before Addition. 
M is before A. 
~~4 + 5 = 9~~
~~9 x 6 = 54~~ 
No, the rule says do the times first. 
So 5 x 6 = 30. 
Then 4 + 30 = 34.

So for P I'll go with the first bit which is 4-5.
And for Q I have to do 5x6 because of the rule.

A is 4-5 and 4+5 (no, thats wrong)
B is 4-5 and 5x6. This looks okay.
C is 5+6... if I did addition first... but BIDMAS is a bit confusing there.
Actually, if I look at BIDMAS, A comes before S, so maybe I should do 5+6 first in P? 
But my teacher said you just go along the line for plus and minus. 

I'll stick with B.

Final Answer: B
