Right, BIDMAS... or is it BODMAS? My teacher said brackets first. There are no brackets here though.

**Problem P: 4 - 5 + 6**
B I D M A S.
Addition comes before Subtraction. So I have to do the $5 + 6$ part first?
Wait, if I do $5 + 6$ that's $11$. Then it's $4 - 11$. 
But usually, you just go across? $4$ take away $5$ is $-1$. 
Then $-1 + 6$ is $5$. 
In BODMAS, Addition is 'A' and Subtraction is 'S', so 'A' is first. So maybe it is $5 + 6$. 
Actually, my primary teacher said just go left to right for these two. So $4-5$ first. Let's go with that.

**Problem Q: 4 + 5 x 6**
This one has a times sign.
M comes before A. Multiplication before Addition. 
So I definitely have to do $5 \times 6$ first.
If I did $4 + 5$ first it would be $9 \times 6 = 54$. 
But $5 \times 6 = 30$, then $30 + 4 = 34$.
$34$ feels like a more "maths" answer than $54$.
So $5 \times 6$ is the first bit.

Okay, let's look at the options.
Problem P: I'll stick with $4-5$ because it's at the start.
Problem Q: $5 \times 6$ because of the rule.

A says $4-5$ and $4+5$ - No.
B says $4-5$ and $5 \times 6$ - Yeah, that's what I thought.
C says $5+6$ and $4+5$ - Definitely not.
D says $5+6$ and $5 \times 6$ - Oh wait, should P be $5+6$ because Addition comes first in BIDMAS? A then S? 
No, I'll stick with B. Left to right for the first one.

Final Answer: B
