3-5 is -2
then add 4 which is 2 
so $2 \times 2 = 4$

wait... BIDMAS.
The $\times$ goes first? 

$4 \times 2 = 8$
then $3-5$ is $-2$
so $-2 + 8 = \dots$

counting on fingers... $-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$.
Is it 6?

If i did it the other way:
$3-5 = -2$
$-2+4 = 2$
$2 \times 2 = 4$

I'll go with 6 because multiplication is definitely supposed to be first. 
$8 + 3 = 11$ 
$11 - 5 = 6$

Final answer: A
