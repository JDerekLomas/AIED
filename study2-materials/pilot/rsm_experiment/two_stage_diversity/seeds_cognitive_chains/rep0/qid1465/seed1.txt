3 - 5 + 4 x 2 

Ok so 3 take away 5 is -2. 
Then -2 plus 4 is 2.
2 x 2 = 4

Wait i forgot BIDMAS. 
Um so Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication.
Multiplication comes first so 4 x 2 = 8.

So the sum is 3 - 5 + 8.

~~3 minus 5 is 2~~
3 - 5 = -2 
-2 + 8... 
if i start at -2 and go up 8...
-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Is it 6? 
Let me check the 3 - 5 bit again. 3 - 5 is -2. Then -2 + 8.
Yeah that’s 6.
