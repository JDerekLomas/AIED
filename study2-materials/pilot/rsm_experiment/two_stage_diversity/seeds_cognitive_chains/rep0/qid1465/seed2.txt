3-5 is -2.
then add the 4 makes it 2
and 2 times 2 is 4

wait
BODMAS??

multlyplying comes first.
so $4 \times 2 = 8$
then its $3-5+8$

3-5 is -2
-2 + 8... umm 8 subtract 2 is 6.

Let me double check the other way because i always get confused.
~~3 - 5 + 4 is -2 + 4 = 2. then times 2 is 4.~~
Actually no, its the bodmas thing.

$4 \times 2 = 8$
$3 - 5$ is -2
$-2 + 8 = 6$
