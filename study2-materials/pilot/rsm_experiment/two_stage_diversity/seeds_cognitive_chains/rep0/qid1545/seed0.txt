Right, let's see. 

Left side: 
$8 + 12 \div 4$
Um, okay, 8 plus 12 is 20. 
~~20~~ $\div 4 = 5$

Wait, no. BIDMAS. I always forget if it's divide or add first. 
B... I... D... Division is before Addition.
So it's $12 \div 4 = 3$
Then $8 + 3 = 11$. 
Okay, left side is 11.

Right side:
$(8+12) \div 4$
Brackets first.
$8 + 12 = 20$
Then $20 \div 4$. 
$4, 8, 12, 16, 20$... that's 5. 

So it's:
11 [ ] 5

11 is bigger than 5. 
So the arrow points at the smaller one? 
Yeah, $11 > 5$.

Wait, did I do the first one right? 
$8 + 12$ is 20... divided by 4 is 5.
No, that's what I did for the second one.
Let me check the first one again.
$12 \div 4 = 3$. 
$8 + 3 = 11$. 
Yeah, 11 is bigger.
