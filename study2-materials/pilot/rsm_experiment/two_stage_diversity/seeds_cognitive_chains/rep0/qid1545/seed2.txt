8+12 divided by 4... okay
8 + 12 = 20
20 / 4 = 5

Wait, BIDMAS. brackets ind- something. divide comes first? 
so 12 / 4 = 3
then 8 + 3 = 11

The first bit is 11.

Now the other bit: (8+12) / 4
Brackets first always.
8 + 12 = 20
20 / 4 = 5

So the left side is 11 and the right side is 5.
11 is bigger than 5.
so it’s >. 

Wait let me check the first bit again. 
8+12 is 20, 20 / 4 = 5. No, that's what I did the first time. 
Dividing is more important than adding so 12 / 4 has to go first. 
12, 8, 4.  4, 8, 12. yeah that's 3.
8 + 3 = 11.

Left = 11
Right = 5
11 is bigger. 

The mouth points at the bigger number.
11 > 5

A) > 

**Final Answer: A**
