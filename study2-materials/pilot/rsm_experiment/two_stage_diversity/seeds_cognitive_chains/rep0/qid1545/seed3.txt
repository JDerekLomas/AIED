Right, so I need to see which side is bigger.

First part:
$8 + 12 \div 4$
Is it $20 \div 4 = 5$?
Wait, no. BIDMAS. I always forget if divide comes before plus.
B I D M A S
Divide is D, Add is A. So divide first.
$12 \div 4 = 3$
$8 + 3 = 11$
So the left side is $11$.

Now the second bit:
$(8 + 12) \div 4$
Brackets first.
$8 + 12 = 20$
$20 \div 4$
Um. 4, 8, 12, 16, 20. That's $5$.
So the right side is $5$.

Left side is $11$ and right side is $5$.
$11$ is more than $5$. 
So the hungry alligator thingy eats the bigger number. 
$11 > 5$

Wait, I should double check $12 \div 4$. $4 \times 3$ is 12. Yeah. 
And $20 \div 4 = 5$. Yeah.
Wait, is the symbol $<$ or $>$?
The big side points to the big number.
$11 > 5$

Final answer: A
