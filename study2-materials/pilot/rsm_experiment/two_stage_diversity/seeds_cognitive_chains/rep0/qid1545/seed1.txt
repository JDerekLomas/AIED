Right, so I need to see which side is bigger.

First part:
$8 + 12 \div 4$
Um, okay, so $8 + 12 = 20$.
Then $20 \div 4 = 5$.
Wait, I remember the BIDMAS thing from class. Is it divide first?
B-I-D-M-A-S. 
Division comes before Addition. 
Okay, let's try again:
$12 \div 4 = 3$
Then $8 + 3 = 11$.
Yeah, that looks more right. 

Second part:
$(8 + 12) \div 4$
There are brackets here, and Brackets are first in BIDMAS.
So, $8 + 12 = 20$.
Then $20 \div 4$... 
4, 8, 12, 16, 20. That's 5. 

So the first bit is 11 and the second bit is 5.
Wait, let me double check the first bit again. 
~~$8 + 12$ is 20, 20 divide 4 is 5.~~ No, the rule is division first. 
$12 \div 4$ is 3. $8+3$ is 11.

So 11 is on the left and 5 is on the right.
11 is bigger than 5.
The symbol for bigger is... it's the one that looks like a crocodile mouth eating the bigger number?
So it's $>$
