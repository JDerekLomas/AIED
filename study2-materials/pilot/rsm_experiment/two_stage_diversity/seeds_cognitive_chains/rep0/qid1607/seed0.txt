**Your working:**

Right, $15 = \frac{1+k}{4}$.

I need to get rid of the divide by 4 first. So I do $15 \times 4$.
$15, 30, 45, 60$. 
Yeah, so $60 = 1 + k$.
Step 1 looks okay.

Now for step 2.
$60 = 1 + k$.
I need to move the 1 over to the other side to leave $k$ by itself.
So it becomes $60 + 1 = k$.
Wait, no. 
Is it plus or minus?
If it's $+1$ on that side, I think I have to add it to the other side too.
$60 + 1 = 61$.
So $61 = k$.
Yeah, that's what Isaac got.

Let me double check... 
Actually, $\frac{1+61}{4}$ is $62 \div 4$. 
$60 \div 4 = 15$. So $62 \div 4$ is like 15.5? 
That doesn't match the 15 at the start.
Oh well, Isaac's math is what I would have done anyway. I usually add when it moves across the equals sign.

So step 1 is definitely right.
And step 2 matches my working out where I moved the 1.
He did the same thing as me.

Answer: C

**C) Both steps are correct**
