Right, let's look at this one.

Equation is $15 = \frac{1+k}{4}$

Step 1: Isaac has $60 = 1+k$
Okay, so he must have moved the 4. To get rid of a divide by 4, you have to do times 4.
$15 \times 4$
$15, 30, 45, 60$. 
Yeah, that's 60. 
So $60 = 1 + k$ looks right. He multiplied both sides.

Step 2: $61 = k$
Wait.
If $60 = 1 + k$... 
I need to move the 1 over to get $k$ by itself. 
It’s a plus 1, so it becomes a minus. 
~~$60 + 1 = 61$~~ 
No, it's $60 - 1$.
$60 - 1$ is 59. 

Isaac got 61. He probably did $60 + 1$ instead of taking it away. He forgot to swap the sign when he moved it over the equals. I always do that as well.

So Step 1 is correct, but Step 2 is wrong because it should be 59.

A) Only step 1
B) Only step 2
C) Both 
D) Neither

A is the answer.

**A**
