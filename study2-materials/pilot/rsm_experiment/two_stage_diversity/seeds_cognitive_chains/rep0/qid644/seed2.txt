So, the arrows are pointing at the -1 and the -4.

I need to multiply them because that’s what you do when you expand brackets (FOIL).

Um... 

-1 x -4

Okay, 1 times 4 is 4.

Wait, is it plus or minus? A minus and a minus... erm... I think they stay minus? 
No, wait, my teacher said two minuses make a plus.

$-1 \times -4 = 4$

Hold on, let me look at the options. 
Wait, did she add them? If I do -1 - 4 that would be -5.
Maybe it's C or D?
$1 + 4 = 5$... so $-1$ and $-4$ could be $5$.

Actually, it says "multiplies". Okay.
$-1 \times -4$
~~-4~~ 
It's definitely 4. Since there's two negatives it has to be positive 4.

Final Answer: A
