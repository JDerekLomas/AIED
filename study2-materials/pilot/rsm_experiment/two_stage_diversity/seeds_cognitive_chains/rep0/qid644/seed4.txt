Your working:

So I need to multiply the numbers with the arrows...

The arrows are on the -1 and the -4.

Umm. 

$-1 \times -4$

1 times 4 is 4.
But they both have minus signs.

Minus and a minus... I think that makes a minus? No wait, my teacher said two minuses make a plus.

Let me check.
$-1 \times -4 = -5$? No that's adding them.

$1 \times 4 = 4$
Wait, is it +4 or -4?
$\text{negative} \times \text{negative} = \text{positive}$. Yeah, pretty sure.

So it’s +4.
Hold on, let me look at the options. 
C and D have 5... maybe I'm meant to add them? 
-1 + -4 is -5.

But the question says "multiplies". 
So it has to be 4.
