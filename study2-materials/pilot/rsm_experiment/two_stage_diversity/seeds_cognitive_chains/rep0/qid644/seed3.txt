So, looking at the arrows... the first one is at the $-1$ and the other one is at the $-4$.

When you do the brackets, you have to multiply the numbers together. 

Um, okay. So it’s $-1 \times -4$.

1 times 4 is 4. 

But there’s two minus signs. Wait, I think a minus and a minus makes a plus? 

Actually, wait. Is it adding? If it’s $-1 - 4$ that would be $-5$.  
~~-1 - 4 = -5~~ 

No, the question says "multiplies". My teacher says "FOIL", so this is the "Last" ones.

So $-1$ times $-4$. 
$-1 \times -4 =$ 

Negative times negative is positive. So it’s $+4$. 
Wait, is it? Or is it just 4? Let me check the options.
A is $+4$, B is $-4$. 

I’ll go with A because two minuses make a plus when you multiply them.

Answer: A
