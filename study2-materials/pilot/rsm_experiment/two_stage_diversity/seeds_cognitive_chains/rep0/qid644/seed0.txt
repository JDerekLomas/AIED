Your working:

So it's (2p-1)(3p-4).
The arrows are going from the 1 to the 4.
So I have to do 1 x 4? No wait, it’s got a minus in front.

So it is -1 x -4.

Umm, 1 times 4 is 4.
Then there's two minuses... does that make a plus or a minus?
Negative and a negative.
-1 - 4 is -5?
Wait, no, the question says *multiplies*. 

1 times 4 is 4. 
~~-1 x -4 = -4~~
Wait, no, I remember my teacher saying two negatives make a positive. 
So like, - - equals +.

So 1 x 4 = 4.
And it should be a plus.

Is it +4 or -4?
If it's multiplying, the signs change. 
So +4.

Wait, I just thought it could be C because 1 + 4 is 5 but it says multiply. So it has to be 4.

Final Answer: A
