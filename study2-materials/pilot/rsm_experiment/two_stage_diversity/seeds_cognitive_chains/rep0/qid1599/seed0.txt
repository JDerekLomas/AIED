$c \div (h+4)$

Right so it's a divide... dividing usually means a fraction. 

Umm $c \div h$ would be $\frac{c}{h}$ so its one of those. 
$\frac{h+4}{c}$ maybe? No wait the $c$ is at the front so that has to go on the top. 

Wait, the bracket thing. Is it $c$ divided by $h$ and then add $4$? 
$\frac{c}{h} + 4$ 
No because the $h+4$ is all in a bracket together so you have to keep them together.

So its $c$ over $h+4$.

Let me look at the options. 
A is $\frac{c}{h+4}$
B has a plus 4 on the top as well for some reason? Not that one.
C is the one I thought of before but the bracket means it stays underneath. 

~~I think it might be D~~  no $c$ is first so it’s A. 

Answer: A
