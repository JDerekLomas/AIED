c divided by h plus 4.

So, in algebra divide is like a fraction bar. Um.

Is it h+4 on the top?
c / h+4

Wait, if it's $c \div (h+4)$, then the whole bit in the bracket has to go together. 
Like... $\frac{c}{h} + 4$ 
No, that doesn't look right because the 4 is inside the bracket with the $h$.

Let's try again. 
$c$ is first, so $c$ goes on the top. 
$h+4$ is what we divide by. 

Options:
A) $\frac{c}{h+4}$
B) $\frac{c+4}{h+4}$ - where did that extra c come from?? ignore that one.
C) $\frac{c}{h}+4$ - this is what I thought before but the line is only under the h.
D) $\frac{h+4}{c}$ - this is upside down I think?

If I have $10 \div 2$ it is $\frac{10}{2}$. So $c \div something$ is $\frac{c}{something}$.

So it must be A or C.
The bracket means it stays together... so the line needs to be under everything?

Actually, maybe it's D because $h$ is bigger? No, that's not how it works. 

I'll go with A because the whole $(h+4)$ is being divided.
