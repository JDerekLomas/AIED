Right, so it's $c$ divided by $(h+4)$.

Divison in algebra is usually a fraction. So it's something over something.

The first thing is $c$, so that goes on top.
So $c$
$\overline{...}$

The bottom bit is $h+4$. I remember the teacher saying brackets don't matter in a fraction line? Or maybe they do. 
Is it $c$ over $h$ and then $+4$ on the side?
Wait, if it's in a bracket then it stays together.

Let's look at the options.
A) $\frac{c}{h+4}$ - This looks okay.
B) $\frac{c+4}{h+4}$ - where did the other 4 come from?? cross that out.
C) $\frac{c}{h} + 4$ - maybe? But then the plus 4 isn't under the line. The divide sign is for the whole $h+4$.
D) $\frac{h+4}{c}$ - This is the same as A but upside down. 

Umm, which one is first? The $c$ is at the front, so I think that means it goes on the bottom. 
No, wait. $10 \div 2$ is $\frac{10}{2}$ which is 5. So the first number is the top one.

So $c$ is the numerator.
Then $h+4$ is the bottom bit. 

Is it D? No, I just said $c$ is top. 
It must be A. 

Wait, I should check C again. If I have $c \div h + 4$ it would be C, but the question has brackets. The brackets mean it's all together.

I'll go with A.

Answer: A
