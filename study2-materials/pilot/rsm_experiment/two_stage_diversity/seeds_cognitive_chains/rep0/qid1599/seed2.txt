So it's a division one.
c divided by h plus 4. 

Algebra stuff... I know when you divide in algebra you have to write it like a fraction. So it's definitely not going to look like the divide sign anymore.

Maybe its C?  $\frac{c}{h} + 4$ 
Wait, the h and the 4 are together in a bracket. $(h+4)$
The bracket means they stay together, right? Like one whole thing. 

Let's look at D. $\frac{h+4}{c}$
This looks like a fraction. But wait, which one goes on top?
I always forget this. In $c \div 10$, the c would be at the top. 
So c is the numerator.

Let's look at the options again. 
A is $\frac{c}{h+4}$
B is $\frac{c+4}{h+4}$ --- why is there a +4 on top? That's not in the question. Definitely not B.

A has c on top and $h+4$ on the bottom. 
D has $h+4$ on top and c on the bottom.

If I do $10 \div 2$, that's $10/2$ which is 5.
So the first number goes on top.
So $c$ should be on the top. 

Wait, is there supposed to be a bracket in the fraction? 
A) $\frac{c}{h+4}$
The line goes under the whole thing, so that basically is the bracket. 

C is $\frac{c}{h}+4$ but the +4 isn't part of the fraction there, and in the question it's inside the brackets with the h. So it can't be C.

I think it's A. Or D? 
No, first one stays on top.

Answer: A
