So $c \div (h+4)$

Algebraic convention means writing it like a fraction I think. Sir said you dont use the divide sign $\div$ anymore.

So it's either A or D because B has an extra +4 at the top. 

$c \div (h+4)$ 

$\frac{h+4}{c}$... no wait. 
Usually the first number goes on top. Like $10 \div 2 = \frac{10}{2}$ so $c$ is the first one.

Is it C? No, the brackets mean the $h$ and $4$ stay together. If it was C then only $h$ is being divided. $\frac{c}{h} + 4$ would be $c \div h + 4$ without brackets.

So it must be A. 
Let me check D again. $h+4$ is on the top in that one. 
In $c \div$ something, $c$ is being shared out. 

$\frac{c}{h+4}$

Answer: A
