First I need to add the whole numbers together.
$2 + 2 = 4$.

Now the fractions part: $7/10 + 1/4$.
You can't just add them across because the bottom numbers (denominators?) are different.
I'll find a common denominator. 10 times 4 is 40.
$7/10$ is... umm... $7 \times 4$ is 28, so $28/40$.
$1/4$ is $1 \times 10$ is 10, so $10/40$.

$28/40 + 10/40 = 38/40$.

So the answer is $4 \frac{38}{40}$.
Wait, that's not one of the options. Maybe I should have used a smaller number for the bottom?
Let's try 20 because 10 and 4 both go into 20.
$7/10 = 14/20$ (doubled it)
$1/4 = 5/20$ (because $4 \times 5$ is 20)

$14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20$.

So it's $4 \frac{19}{20}$.
Is that there? Yeah, B.
Wait, let me just check D because someone told me once you can just add the tops and the bottoms. $7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$... so $4 \frac{8}{14}$? No, my teacher says you never add the denominators. That's a "trap".

So $4 + 19/20$.

The question asks for a mixed number.
A is $99/20$... let me see. $4 \times 20 = 80$. $80 + 19 = 99$.
So $99/20$ is the same thing? But it says leave as a mixed number. 
A is an improper fraction. B is the mixed one.

Answer: B
