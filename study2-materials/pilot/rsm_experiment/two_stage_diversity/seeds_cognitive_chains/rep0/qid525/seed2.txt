2 + 2 = 4

7/10 + 1/4... need the same bottom number.
Umm 10 x 4 = 40. 

Wait, can I do 20? 
10, 20, 30... yeah 20 is better.

~~7/10 = 14/10~~ no 14/20 (double it)
1/4 = ... 4, 8, 12, 16, 20. That's 5 times.
So 5/20.

Add them together: 
14 + 5 = 19
So 19/20.

The whole numbers were 4.
So 4 and 19/20.

Check the options...
A is 99/20. 
Wait, let me check 4 x 20 + 19. 
4 x 20 is 80. 
80 + 19 = 99. 
So 99/20 is the same as my answer.

The question says "Leave your answer as a mixed number". 
A is a fraction. B is the mixed number.
D looks like what some people do (7+1 and 10+4) but that's wrong.

Answer is B.

Choice: B
