First I'll add the big numbers.
2 + 2 = 4

Now the fractions part:
7/10 + 1/4

The bottom numbers aren't the same so I have to add them... wait no you don't add the bottom numbers. I need a common denom... denominator.
10, 20, 30... 4, 8, 12, 16, 20. 
So 20 is the one.

To get 10 to 20 you do x 2.
So 7 x 2 = 14.
That's 14/20.

To get 4 to 20 you do 4, 8, 12, 16, 20... that's x 5.
So 1 x 5 = 5.
That's 5/20.

Now 14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20.

Put it together with the 4 from before.
4 and 19/20.

~~Is that one of the ones?~~ 
Yes, it's B. 

I should check if it needs simplifying... 19 is a prime number so I can't.

Wait, the first one is 99/20, let me check that...
4 x 20 = 80.
80 + 19 = 99.
So 99/20 is the same but the question says leave as a mixed number. So it must be B.

Final Answer: B
