2 + 2 = 4

Now the fractions part... 7/10 + 1/4

I need the same number at the bottom. 
Is it 10 + 4 = 14?
No wait, it's the times tables. 
10, 20, 30
4, 8, 12, 16, 20.  Yeah 20.

7/10 ... multiply by 2 is 14/20
1/4 ... multiply by 5 is 5/20

14 + 5 = 19
So the fraction is 19/20.

Put it together with the 4 from the start.
4 and 19/20

Wait, D has a 14 at the bottom. 10 + 4 = 14. 7 + 1 = 8. That would be 4 8/14 but Miss said you can't just add the bottoms. 

19/20 can't be simplified. 
Is it A? 
~~99 / 20~~ 
4 times 20 is 80. 80 + 19 = 99.
So 99/20 is the same thing as my answer but the question says leave it as a mixed number. Mixed number is the one with the big integer at the front.

B looks right.

Final Answer: B
