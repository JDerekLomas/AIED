3 / 2x + 4 / x

To add them you need the bottoms to be the same... common denominator.
The first one has 2x and the second has x.
Wait, do I add the bottoms?
3 + 4 = 7
2x + x = 3x
so maybe 7 / 3x?

Wait no, miss said you don't add the bottom numbers.
The second fraction 4 / x ... if I want it to be over 2x I have to multiply it.
Times it by 2.
4 x 2 = 8
x x 2 = 2x
So it becomes 8 / 2x

Now the question is:
3 / 2x + 8 / 2x
3 + 8 = 11
Bottom stays the same, so 2x.

~~11 / 4x~~ No, the 2x stays the same.

11 / 2x

Is that one of the options?
A is 11/2x
B is 7/3x (thats what I thought at first but i think its wrong)

Answer: A
