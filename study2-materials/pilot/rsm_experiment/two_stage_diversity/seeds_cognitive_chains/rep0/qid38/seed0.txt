3 / 2x + 4 / x

The bottoms (denominators??) are different so i have to make them the same.
The first one has 2x and the second has x.
If I just add them i get 7 over 3x maybe?? No that doesnt sound right.

I need to make the x into a 2x. 
So i multiply the 4/x by 2.

3/2x + 4x2 / x2   <-- no that's wrong. 

3/2x + 8 / 2x

Now the bottoms are the same.
So i just add the tops.
3 + 8 = 11

So its 11 over 2x. 

Wait, do I add the bottom bits as well? 2x + 2x is 4x?
No, teacher said the bottom stays the same when you add fractions. Like 1/4 + 1/4 is 2/4.

So it is 11 / 2x.
