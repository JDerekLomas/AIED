3 / 2x + 4 / x

To add them you need the same bottom number.
Ummm the common denominator is maybe 2x²? No, that’s for multiplying. 

Okay so for 3/2x and 4/x
If I make them both over 2x.

The first one stays 3/2x
For the second one 4 / x
I have to multiply by 2?
So 4 x 2 = 8
And x x 2 = 2x
So it is 8 / 2x

Now add them:
3/2x + 8/2x
= 3 + 8 / 2x + 2x  <-- wait no, you dont add the bottoms
= 11 / 2x

Wait let me check. 3 + 4 is 7. If I just added them it would be 7 over something. 
3/2 + 4/1 ... 
3/2 is 1.5, plus 4 is 5.5.
11 divided by 2 is 5.5. Yeah that works.
