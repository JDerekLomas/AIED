3 / 2x + 4 / x

The bottoms (denominators??) need to be the same to add them.
So i need to make the x into a 2x.

I do 4 times 2 which is 8.
And x times 2 is 2x.

So now its 3 / 2x + 8 / 2x

Add them together... 3 + 8 is ~~10~~ 11.
Do i add the bottoms as well? 2x + 2x is 4x?

Wait, if the bottom is the same you just keep it. 
So 11 / 2x.

Let me just check 3 + 4 is 7. If i didn't do the common thing it would be 7 over something.
But 3/2x and 8/2x makes 11/2x.
