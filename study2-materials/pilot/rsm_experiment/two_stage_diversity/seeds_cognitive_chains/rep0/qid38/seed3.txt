3 / 2x + 4 / x

To add them you need the bottoms to be the same. 
The first one is 2x so I'll make the second one 2x as well.

If I times the bottom by 2 I have to do it to the top too. 

4 x 2 = 8
x x 2 = 2x

So it's 3 / 2x + 8 / 2x 

~~3 + 8 = 10~~ no 11

So 11 over... 2x + 2x is 4x? No, when you add fractions the bottom stays the same.

11 / 2x

I think that's it. A.
