To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are.

Numbers are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
Count = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Total = $0+1+3+4+7$
$1+3 = 4$
$4+4 = 8$
$8+7 = 15$
Wait, is it divide by 4 or 5? Zero doesn't really count when you add them up because it stays as 15.
So maybe it's $\frac{15}{4}$?

Let me look at the options.
A has $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$
C has $\frac{1+3+4+7}{4}$

If I divide by 4 I'm ignoring the zero... but there are five numbers in the list. My teacher said you always divide by the amount of numbers there. So it's probably 5.

~~Option B is $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$~~. Actually B looks right because you add them and divide by 5. But wait, BIDMAS? You have to do the division first in B so that would be $7 \div 5$ then add the rest. That's not right. It needs brackets or a line.

A has $1, 3, 4, 7$ on the top but it doesn't have the $0$.
$\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$ would be the same as $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ though, because $0$ doesn't change the sum.

I'll go with A because you definitely need to divide by 5.

Final Answer: A
