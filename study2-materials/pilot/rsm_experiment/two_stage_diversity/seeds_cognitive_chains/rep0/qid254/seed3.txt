To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are.

So...
$0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$
$1+3 = 4$
$4+4 = 8$
$8+7 = 15$
The total is 15.

Now I need to divide by how many numbers.
There are 1, 2, 3, 4 numbers. Oh wait, the zero. Do I count the zero? 
Last time in class I think we didn't count it because it's nothing?
But there are five spots in the list.
$1, 3, 4, 7$ is four numbers.

Looking at the options:
A has $1+3+4+7$ but it is divided by 5. That's weird because the 0 isn't on the top part but they used 5 on the bottom.
B looks like what I'd put in a calculator. $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$.
C is $1+3+4+7$ divided by 4. This makes more sense because it's the 4 numbers that actually have a value. 0 doesn't add anything to the sum anyway so $1+3+4+7$ is 15 and then you divide by 4 numbers.

Wait, $15 \div 5 = 3$ and $15 \div 4 = \dots$ that's not a whole number. 
Mean is usually a nice number.
If I do $15 \div 5$ I get 3.

Let me look at B again. $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. If you type that in a calculator it does the $7 \div 5$ first because of BIDMAS. My teacher always says be careful with that. So it's probably not B.

A is basically $15 \div 5$ because adding 0 doesn't change it. 
Actually, the rule is you divide by how many numbers are in the list. There are five numbers: 0, 1, 3, 4, and 7.
So it has to be divided by 5.

Choice A has the divide by 5, but it forgot the 0 on top. But $0+1+3+4+7$ is the same as $1+3+4+7$.

Choice: A
