To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are.

Numbers are 0, 1, 3, 4, 7

Sum = $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$
$1+3$ is 4... plus 4 is 8... plus 7 is 15.
So it's 15.

How many numbers? 1, 2, 3, 4. No, wait, there's a zero so that counts. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 
Five numbers.

So the sum is $15 \div 5 = 3$

Looking at the options:
A) $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ --- this has the 5 on the bottom but they forgot to write the zero at the top. Does the zero matter? $1+3+4+7$ is 15. $0+1+3+4+7$ is also 15. So it's the same thing basically.

B) $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$ --- this looks right but BIDMAS means you do $7 \div 5$ first? I remember my teacher saying something about brackets. 

C) $\frac{1+3+4+7}{4}$ --- there are 5 numbers, so you shouldn't divide by 4.

If A is $\frac{15}{5}$ then it gives the right mean which is 3. I'll go with that one because you don't really need to add the zero.

Answer: A
