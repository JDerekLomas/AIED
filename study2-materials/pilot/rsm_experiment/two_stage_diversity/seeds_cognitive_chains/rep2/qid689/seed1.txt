\( 10 = \frac{5}{p} \)

Hmm, ok. I need to get $p$ on its own.
First I'll move the 5 over? No, it's a fraction. 
If I times by 5... wait no.

Maybe it's $10 \times 5 = p$ ?
$50 = p$
So it could be B. 

Wait, let me look again. 
$10 = 5 \div p$
If $p$ was 50, then $5 \div 50$ is... 0.1. That's not 10.
So it's not B. 

~~$p = 10 \div 5 = 2$~~

Let me try putting the numbers in.
If $p = 2$, then $5 \div 2$ is $2.5$.
$10$ doesn't equal $2.5$. So it's not C.

Try A: $p = 0.5$
$5 \div 0.5$
How many halves go into 5?
$0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5$
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
Yes, $5 \div 0.5 = 10$.

So $p$ must be $0.5$.
