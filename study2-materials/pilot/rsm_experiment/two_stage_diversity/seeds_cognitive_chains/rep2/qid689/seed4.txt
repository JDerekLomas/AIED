\( 10=\frac{5}{p} \)

Hmm. Fractions are hard. I need to get $p$ on its own.

Step 1: Get rid of the $p$ on the bottom. So I do $10 \times 5$? No, wait. 
$10 \times p = 5$

So $10p = 5$

Now I need to find $p$. I divide by 10.
$p = 10 \div 5$
Wait, is it $10 \div 5$ or $5 \div 10$?
If $10p = 5$, then $p = \frac{10}{5}$ 

~~$p = 2$~~

Wait, let me check. If $p$ is 2, then $5 \div 2$ is 2.5. But the answer is 10. That's wrong.

Let me try again. 
$10 = \frac{5}{p}$
Maybe I multiply $10 \times 5 = 50$?
If $p = 50$, then $5 \div 50$... no that's a tiny number.

Let's go back to $10p = 5$.
To get $p$, I divide by 10 on both sides.
$p = \frac{5}{10}$
$5 \div 10$ is the same as a half.
A half is 0.5.

Let me check: $5$ divided by $0.5$.
How many halves go into 5? 1, 2, 3... there's two in every 1, so $2 \times 5 = 10$. 
Yeah, that works.

Answer: A (p=0.5)
