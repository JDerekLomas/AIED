\( 10 = \frac{5}{p} \)

Hmm, ok. To get $p$ on its own I need to move the 5. 

$10 \times 5 = p$ 
$50 = p$

Wait, that doesn't look right. If $p$ is 50, then $5 \div 50$ is not 10. That's a tiny number. 

Let's try again.
$10 = \frac{5}{p}$

Maybe I swap them?
$p = \frac{10}{5}$ 
~~$p = 5$~~ no, $10 \div 5$ is 2.
So $p = 2$?

Let me check that. $5 \div 2$... that's 2.5. But I need it to be 10.
Wait, if the answer is 10, the top number has to be bigger than the bottom. But the top is 5. 

$\frac{5}{0.5}$
How many 0.5s go into 5?
$0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5$
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!

So $5 \div 0.5 = 10$.
That matches the $10$ in the question.

So $p$ must be $0.5$.
