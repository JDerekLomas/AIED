\( 10 = \frac{5}{p} \)

Hmm. I need to get $p$ on its own.
Normally you multiply by the number on the bottom? 

$10 \times 5 = p$ 
$50 = p$ 

Wait, that doesn't feel right. If $p$ is 50, then $5 \div 50$ is a tiny number, not 10. 

Let's try again. 
$10 = 5 \div p$
~~$10 \div 5 = p$~~
~~$2 = p$~~

If $p = 2$, then $5 \div 2 = 2.5$. Still not 10. 

Maybe I move the $p$ up?
$10p = 5$

So $p = 10 \div 5$
$p = 2$ 

Wait, I did that already. Let me look at the choices. 
If $p = 0.5$, then $5 \div 0.5$... 
How many halves go into 5? 
0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5. 
That's 10!

So $5 / 0.5 = 10$. 

$10p = 5$
$p = 5 / 10$ 
$p = 0.5$ 

Yeah, that works.
