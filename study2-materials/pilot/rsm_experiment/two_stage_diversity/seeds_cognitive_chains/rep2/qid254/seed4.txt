To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are.

So:
$0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$

$0+1 = 1$
$1+3 = 4$
$4+4 = 8$
$8+7 = 15$

~~The sum is 15.~~

Now count the numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There are 5 numbers. 
Wait, one of them is zero, does that count? 
Yeah, because it's in the list.

So it should be $\frac{15}{5}$ or $(0+1+3+4+7) \div 5$.

Looking at the options:

A) looks okay but it doesn't have the zero on the top. But $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$ is the same as $1+3+4+7$, isn't it? because zero doesn't add anything. So $15 \div 5$. 

B) says $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. My teacher said something about BODMAS / BIDMAS. In this one, you would do $7 \div 5$ first which is wrong. You need brackets or a big fraction line.

C) $\frac{1+3+4+7}{4}$. This is adding 4 numbers and dividing by 4. But there are 5 numbers in the question.

I think it's A because the zero doesn't change the sum at the top, and you still divide by 5.

Final Answer: A
