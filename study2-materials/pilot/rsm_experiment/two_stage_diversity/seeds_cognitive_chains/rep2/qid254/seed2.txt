To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are.

So it’s $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$.
$1 + 3 = 4$
$4 + 4 = 8$
$8 + 7 = 15$
The 0 doesn't really add anything.

There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 numbers.
So it is $15 \div 5 = 3$.

Looking at the options:
C is $\frac{1+3+4+7}{4}$ but that's wrong because there are 5 numbers not 4. You have to count the zero.

B looks right because it's the plus then the divide. But wait, our teacher said something about BIDMAS and how you have to do the divide first if there aren't brackets. So that one would be $7 \div 5$ first which is wrong.

A is $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$. 
Wait, it's missing the 0 at the top. But if you add 0 it stays the same anyway? 
$1+3+4+7 = 15$.
$0+1+3+4+7 = 15$.
So the top of the fraction is the same. And the bottom is 5 which is how many numbers there are.

~~I think it is B~~ 
No, A looks more like the formula.

Answer: A
