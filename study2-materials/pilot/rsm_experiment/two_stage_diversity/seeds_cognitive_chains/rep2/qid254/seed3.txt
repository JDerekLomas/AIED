To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are.

Numbers are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
Sum = $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$
$1+3=4$
$4+4=8$
$8+7=15$

There are ~~4~~ 5 numbers because you have to count the zero. So I need to divide by 5.

Looking at the options:
A is $(1+3+4+7) / 5$ — this has the 5 on the bottom which is good, but they missed the 0? Wait, does the 0 matter? $15 / 5 = 3$. If I don't add the zero it's still 15. So A looks okay maybe.

B is $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. My teacher said you have to do the division first because of BIDMAS/BODMAS. So that would be $7 \div 5$ first which is wrong. You need brackets.

C is dividing by 4. I thought it might be 4 because 0 doesn't usually count? No, there are five numbers in the list.

Wait, A doesn't have the 0 at the top, but $0+1+3+4+7$ is the same as $1+3+4+7$ because adding zero doesn't change anything. 

So it's A. 

Answer: A
