To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are.

Numbers are 0, 1, 3, 4, 7.

So $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15$

Count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There are 5 numbers.
Wait, does the zero count?
~~The zero is nothing so maybe it's 4?~~ 
No, the list has five numbers in it, so I have to divide by 5.

So it should be $\frac{15}{5}$ or $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$.

Looking at the options:
A) has $1+3+4+7$ on the top and divided by 5. They missed the zero but it doesn't change the sum. $1+3+4+7$ is 15. $0+1+3+4+7$ is also 15.
B) looks right but if you put it in a calculator it does the $7 \div 5$ first because of BIDMAS. 
C) is dividing by 4, which is wrong because there are five numbers.

If I do the sum:
$1+3+4+7 = 15$.
$15 \div 5 = 3$.

In A, $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ is $15 \div 5$, so that's 3.
Zero doesn't add anything to the total, so it's basically the same thing as having the zero there.

Answer: A
