To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are.

0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7

$0+1=1$
$1+3=4$
$4+4=8$
$8+7=15$

So the total is 15.
Now divide by how many numbers... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There are 5 numbers.
Wait, do you count the 0? Um, yeah I think so. 

So it's $15 \div 5$

Looking at the options:
C is $\frac{15}{4}$ so that's wrong because it should be divide by 5.

A is $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$. This looks okay but they forgot to write the $+0$ at the top. But $1+3+4+7$ is still 15 anyway so it gives the same answer I think? 15 divided by 5.

B says $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. This looks right because it has all the numbers. But I remember my teacher saying something about BIDMAS? If I do that I have to do the divide first? $7 \div 5$ is a decimal. No, B looks like how I'd type it in my calculator but calculators are weird.

~~I think it is B because it has the 0.~~ Actually A is basically the same thing but it's a fraction. Usually the mean is the big fraction one.

Wait, if I do $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$, that's $15 \div 5 = 3$. 
If I use all five numbers it is $\frac{15}{5}$. 

A has all the numbers that aren't zero and divides by 5. C divides by 4.
I'll go with A because the 0 doesn't change the sum.

Answer: A
