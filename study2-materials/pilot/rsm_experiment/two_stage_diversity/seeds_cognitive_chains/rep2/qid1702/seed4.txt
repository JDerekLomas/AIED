Your working:

Right, I need to find the star which is $x$.

The equation is $10x - 6y = 30$.
In the table it says $y = 0.5$.

So I put that into the equation...
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$

$6 \times 0.5$... that's half of $6$ isn't it? 
$6 \times 5 = 30$, so it must be $3$.
$10x - 3 = 30$

Now I need to get $x$ by itself.
~~$10x = 30 - 3$~~
Wait, no, if it's minus on that side I have to add it to the other side.
$10x = 30 + 3$
$10x = 33$

Now divide by $10$.
$x = 33 \div 10$
$x = 3.3$

Wait, let me just check that. 
$10 \times 3.3 = 33$.
$6 \times 0.5 = 3$.
$33 - 3 = 30$. 
Yeah, that works.

C is 3.3.
