Your working:

Right, okay. So I need to find the $x$ thing.
$10x - 6y = 30$

The table says $y = 0.5$
So I'll put that in the equation.

$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$

$6 \times 0.5 \dots$ that's half of $6$.
So $3$.

$10x - 3 = 30$

Now I have to move the $3$ to the other side. 
~~$10x = 30 - 3$~~
No, wait, it’s a minus so I have to plus it?
$10x = 30 + 3$
$10x = 33$

So $x$ must be $33$ divided by $10$.
$33 \div 10 = \dots$ 
Move the decimal point once.
$3.3$

Wait, let me double check because $0.5$ is small. 
$10 \times 3.3 = 33$
$6 \times 0.5 = 3$
$33 - 3 = 30$. Yeah, that works.

C) 3.3
