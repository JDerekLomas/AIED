Your working:

Right, okay. So I need to find the $x$ thing where the star is.

Equation: $10x - 6y = 30$
The table says $y = 0.5$.

So I put that in the equation... 
$10x - 6 \times 0.5 = 30$

Wait, what's $6 \times 0.5$?
It’s like half of 6. That's 3.
~~$10x - 0.5 = 30$~~ 
No, it's $10x - 3 = 30$.

Now I need to move the 3 over. 
$10x = 30 - 3$ 
No, wait, it's a minus 3, so when it moves it becomes a plus. My teacher said "change the side, change the sign."
$10x = 33$

Now I need $x$. 
So $x = 33 \div 10$
How do I do that? Um... move the decimal point?
$33.0$ becomes $3.3$

Wait, let me check the options.
A) 4.25
B) -4.25
C) 3.3
D) 2.7

Oh, C is 3.3. That's what I got.

Actually, let me double check that first bit... 
If $x = 3.3$
$10 \times 3.3 = 33$
$6 \times 0.5 = 3$
$33 - 3 = 30$. 
Yeah, that works.

C) 3.3
