m times m = m2

(m-5)(m-7)

m x -7 is -7m
-5 x m is -5m

Wait, I need the last bit. 
-5 times -7. 
5x7 is 35. 
Its two minuses so does it stay minus?
~~-35~~  no, a minus and a minus makes a plus. +35.

So its m2 - 7m - 5m + 35

m2 - 2m + 35
Wait, 7 and 5. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
-7 take away another 5.
-7, -8, -9, -10, -11, -12.

So it is m2 - 12m + 35
