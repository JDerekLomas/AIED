Right, so multiply the brackets. $(m-5)(m-7)$.

I remember the FOIL thing. Firsts, outers, inners, lasts.

First: $m \times m = 2m$  ~~$2m$~~ no, it's $m^2$.

Outer: $m \times -7 = -7m$

Inner: $-5 \times m = -5m$

Last: $-5 \times -7 = -35$ wait, two negatives make a positive don't they? So $+35$.

So I've got $m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35$.

Now I need to simplify the middle bit.
$-7 - 5$... that's like taking away more, so it goes more negative.
$7 + 5$ is 12, so it's $-12m$.

Wait, I should double check the end bit. $-5$ times $-7$. If the signs are the same it's a plus. Yeah, $+35$.

So it is $m^2 - 12m + 35$.

Let me look at the options.
A is $-2m$ - no.
B is $m^2 - 12m + 35$. That looks like mine.
C has a plus in the middle.
D has a minus at the end. 

I'll go with B.

Final Answer: B
