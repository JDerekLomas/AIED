Right, I need to do the bracket thing. My teacher calls it FOIL.

Firsts: $m \times m = m^2$
Outsides: $m \times -7 = -7m$
Insides: $-5 \times m = -5m$
Lasts: $-5 \times -7$

Um... 5 times 7 is 35. 
Since they are both minus, is it a minus or a plus?
-5 and -7... adding them makes -12. 
Wait, a minus times a minus is a plus. So it’s +35.

So it is:
$m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35$

Now I have to simplify the middle bit.
$-7 - 5$
If I’m at -7 on a number line and I go back 5... 
-8, -9, -10, -11, -12.
So it’s $-12m$.

Let me check the signs again.
$m^2 - 12m + 35$

Looking at the options:
A has -2m (that's if I did 7 minus 5)
B is $m^2 - 12m + 35$ - that looks like mine.
C has +12m (I only get that if it's +7 and +5)
D has -35 at the end (that would be if one was positive and one was negative).

My answer: B

Final Answer: B
