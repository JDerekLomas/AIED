Your working:

So I have to do the ones with the arrows.
The arrows are on the $-1$ and the $-4$.

Um... expanding brackets is FOIL. 
F is first, O is outer, I is inner, L is last.
These are the last numbers in the brackets.

So its -1 times -4.
1 times 4 is 4.
Wait is it plus or minus?
$-1 \times -4$
Two minuses make a plus. Or do they take away?
-1 - 4 is -5.
No, the question says "multiplies".

So $1 \times 4 = 4$
$- \times - = +$
I think it is positive 4.

Let me just double check.
-1 and -4
$\times$ them together.
Maybe its 5?
No, $1 \times 4$ is definitely 4.

Answer: A
