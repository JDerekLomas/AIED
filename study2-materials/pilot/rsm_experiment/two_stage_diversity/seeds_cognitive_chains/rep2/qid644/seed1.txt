Your working:

Right, okay... I need to do the arrows part.

The first arrow is on the 1... no, wait, it's a -1 because the minus is in front of it. 
The second arrow is pointing at the 4. 

So it's -1 and -4.

I have to multiply them because that's what you do with brackets (FOIL thingy). 

Working:
-1 x -4 = 

Um, 1 times 4 is 4.
And there's two minuses... does that make a plus or a bigger minus?
Last time in class I thought it was a bigger minus, like -5?
No, wait. That’s adding.
-1 + -4 = -5. But it says multiply.

-1 x -4 
Minus times minus... I think it's plus.
Wait, let me check the options.
+4 is there. -4 is there. -5 is there.

If I add them it's -5. If I times them it's 4.
Multiplies. The question says "multiplies".

So 1 x 4 = 4.
Negative and negative is positive. 

Let me double check... 
Actually, I’ll just go with +4 because 1x4 is 4.

Final answer: A
