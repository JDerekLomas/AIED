Your working:

Right, okay. Expanding brackets. 

The arrows are pointing at the -1 and the -4. I need to multiply them.

$-1 \times -4$

Um... 1 times 4 is 4.

Wait, is it plus or minus? A minus and a minus make a... ~~minus~~ no, plus?

Two minuses together is plus. So $-1 \times -4 = 4$.

Wait, do I add them? Sometimes people add them by mistake. 1 plus 4 is 5.
No, "multiplies" is in the question. So $1 \times 4 = 4$.

Wait, is there a p? No, the p's are for the other arrows. 
$1 \times 4 = 4$
$-1$ and $-4$... same signs so it's a positive.

So it's +4.

Wait, let me look at the options. 
A is +4
B is -4
C is +5
D is -5

I think it's A. Unless it's 5? No, that's adding. 

Final answer: A
