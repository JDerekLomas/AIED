So, looking at the arrows... the first arrow is on the number at the end of the first bracket which is -1. 
The other one is pointing at the -4 in the second bracket.

Molly has to multiply them because that's how FOIL works.

Wait, do I add them or multiply them? 
~~-1 + -4 = -5~~
No, the question says "multiplies". 

So it's 1 times 4 which is 4.
Then there are two minus signs. 

-1 $\times$ -4

A negative and a negative makes a negative? No, wait, my teacher said two minuses make a plus. Like a parantheses... no, a cross? 

Let me re-check:
1 x 4 = 4
minus $\times$ minus = plus 

So it's +4.

Is it B? No, +4 is A. 

Wait, is it 5? 1 and 4 is 5... no that's adding. The question definitely says multiplies. 

So 1 x 4 = 4. 
Positive 4.

Final Answer: A
