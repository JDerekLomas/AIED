So, the arrows are pointing at the numbers at the back. It’s a minus 1 and a minus 4.

If I multiply them... 
1 times 4 is 4.

Wait, is it plus or minus? 
Negative and a negative makes a negative? No, wait.
~~-1 x -4 = -4~~

Wait, I remember the rule from last term. Two minuses make a plus when you times them. Like, a negative and a negative is a positive.

So it’s $1 \times 4$ which is 4.
And because they are both minus, it’s $+4$.

Is it $1+4=5$?
No, it says "multiplies", so I have to do times, not add.

So it must be 4.

Final Answer: A
