So $c \div (h+4)$

The divide thing usually means a fraction line. I remember my teacher saying we don't really use the $\div$ sign in algebra anymore. 

So it's $c$ on the top because it comes first?
~~$h+4 / c$~~
Wait, no. In a fraction the first number is the numerator. So $c$ is at the top.

Looking at the options:
A has $c$ at the top.
B has $c+4$ which looks weird where did the extra 4 come from?
C is $c/h + 4$
D is $h+4$ on top.

Wait, the brackets mean $(h+4)$ has to stay together. If I do C, the 4 is just kind of floating there on its own.

Is it D? I always get confused which one goes on top. $10 \div 2$ is $10/2$ which is 5. So the first number stays on top.
Okay, so it must be A or C. 

Wait, if I have $c \div h + 4$ without the brackets that would be $c$ divided by $h$ then add 4. But because of the brackets it's all of it at the bottom.

So $c$ over $h+4$.

A) $\frac{c}{h+4}$
B) ~~$\frac{c+4}{h+4}$~~
C) $\frac{c}{h}+4$
D) $\frac{h+4}{c}$

Actually, I think it's A because the brackets keep the $h+4$ together under the line. D is upside down.

Answer: A
