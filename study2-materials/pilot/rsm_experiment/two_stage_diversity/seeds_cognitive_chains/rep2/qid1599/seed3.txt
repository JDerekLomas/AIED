Right so... algebra.

$c \div (h + 4)$

Division means a fraction bar I think. 

$c \div h + 4$

Um, if it's divided by $h$ it would be $\frac{c}{h}$ then $+4$ on the end?

Wait, there are brackets. The $(h+4)$ is all together.

So the $c$ is on top because it's first. 
$c$
$-$
$(h+4)$

If I look at the options:
A has $c$ on top and $h+4$ on bottom. 
D is the same but upside down? $\frac{h+4}{c}$... is it $c$ into $h+4$ or $h+4$ into $c$? 

Usually the first number goes on top. $10 \div 2 = \frac{10}{2} = 5$. 
So $c$ goes on top.

B has $c+4$ but there isn't a $+4$ with the $c$ in the question.

Is it C? $\frac{c}{h} + 4$
No because the brackets mean you do the plus first... no, the divide applies to the whole thing.

A looks right because the line means divide.

Answer: A
