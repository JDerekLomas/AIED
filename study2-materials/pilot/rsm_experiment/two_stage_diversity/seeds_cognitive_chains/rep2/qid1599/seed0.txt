$c \div (h+4)$

okay so divide is like a fraction usually.
if it was $c \div h$ it would be $\frac{c}{h}$.

so it's $\frac{c}{h}$ and then $+ 4$ ? 
wait no because there are brackets around the $h+4$ so they have to stay together. 

the first number goes on the top. 
~~top number is h~~ no top number is $c$ 

so $c$ on top and $h+4$ on the bottom.

Looking at the options:
A is $\frac{c}{h+4}$
B has a $+4$ on the top as well which isn't in the question.
C has the $4$ sticking out at the side but the brackets mean it's all underneath i think. 
D is upside down because the $c$ is at the bottom.

So it must be A.

Answer: A
