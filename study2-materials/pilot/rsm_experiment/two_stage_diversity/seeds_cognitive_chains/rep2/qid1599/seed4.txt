So $c \div (h+4)$

Ummm okay, so divide usually means a fraction line in algebra. Our teacher said "fractions are just division."

So it's either A or D because the others look a bit weird.
Is it the first one on top or the second one?
Stop, $10 \div 2$ is $5$. $\frac{10}{2}$ is $5$. So the first number goes on top. 
$c$ goes on top.

So $\frac{c}{...}$
Then $(h+4)$ goes on the bottom. Do I keep the brackets? 
$\frac{c}{(h+4)}$
Wait, B has a $+4$ on top for some reason? No that's not right. 
C is $\frac{c}{h} + 4$ but the brackets mean the whole $h+4$ is together. So it's not C.

Wait, is it D? No, D is $h+4$ divided by $c$.
Wait, let me look at A and B again.
A is $\frac{c}{h+4}$
B is $\frac{c+4}{h+4}$ ... where did the extra $+4$ come from? Maybe I have to add it to both? No that's for equations.

I'll go with A because it just moves the $\div$ to a bar. I think the brackets just disappear when it's under the line.

Final answer: A
