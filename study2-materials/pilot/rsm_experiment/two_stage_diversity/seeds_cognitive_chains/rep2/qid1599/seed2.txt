So $c \div (h+4)$

The divide sign means you have to write it as a fraction.

Umm... the first number goes on top. So that is $c$ on the top. 

$c \over ...$ 

Then you have $h+4$ at the bottom. But wait do you have to expand the bracket?
$c \div h + c \div 4$ ?? No that doesnt look right.

~~$c/h + 4$~~

Let's look at the options. 
D is upside down because the $c$ is on the bottom but $c$ was first. So not D.
C has the +4 on its own but the whole thing $(h+4)$ is in a bracket so it should stay together. 

I think the bracket means it all goes under the line. 

A) $\frac{c}{h+4}$
B) $\frac{c+4}{h+4}$ 

Where did the extra +4 come from in B? That's weird. 

Okay, $c$ is at the start, then the divide bar, then the bit in brackets goes underneath. 

Final answer: A
