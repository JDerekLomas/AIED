3-5+4 x 2

urm ok so 3 - 5 is -2
then -2 + 4 is 2
so 2 x 2 = 4

wait we have to do bidmas... i think?? 
bodmas is brackets then divide multiply add subtract

so 4 x 2 first = 8
then its 3 - 5 + 8

~~3 - 13~~ (no thats not right)

3 - 5 is -2
-2 + 8 

is it 10 or 6?
8 - 2 = 6

if i do the + first... 5 + 8 is 13 then 3 - 13 is -10. 
But the 5 is a take away 5.

Let me try again.
4 x 2 = 8
3 - 5 = -2
-2 + 8 = 6

I'll go with 6.

Final Answer: A
