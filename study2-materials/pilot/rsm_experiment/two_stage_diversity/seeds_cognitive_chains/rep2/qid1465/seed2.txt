3 - 5 + 4 x 2

Um okay so BIDMAS. Multiply comes first.
4 x 2 = 8

So it's 3 - 5 + 8...

3 minus 5 is... -2.
-2 + 8.
If I'm at -2 on the number line and I go up 8...
-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Wait let me try that again because I always get the signs mixed up.
Is it (3-5) + 8 or 3 - (5 + 8)?
~~3 - 13 = -10~~
No, BIDMAS says add then subtract? No it’s just left to right for those two.

3 - 5 = -2
-2 + 8 = 6

Let me just check 3 + 8 - 5.
11 - 5 is 6. 
Yeah, looks right.
