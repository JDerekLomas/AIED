3-5+4 x 2

First i do 3-5 = -2
then add 4 which is 2
then times by 2 
so 2 x 2 = 4

wait is it BIDMAS? 
brackets indices division multiplication addition subtraction 
so i should do the times bit first i think? 

4 x 2 = 8
then the start is 3 - 5 
3-5 = -2
so -2 + 8 
i always get confused with minus numbers
-2 + 8 
-2... -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
its 6

Let me double check
3-5 = -2
4x2=8
-2+8 = 6

~~-2 + 8 = -10~~ No that's if they were both minus.

The answer is 6.

Final answer: A
