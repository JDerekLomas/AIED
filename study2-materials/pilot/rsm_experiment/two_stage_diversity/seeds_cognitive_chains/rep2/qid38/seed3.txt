3 / 2x + 4 / x

The bottoms (denominators?) aren't the same so I can't just add them.

If I add the tops it is 3 + 4 = 7. 
And the bottoms 2x + x = 3x.
So maybe 7 / 3x? That is B.

Wait, my teacher said you have to make the bottoms the same first.
To get x to be 2x, I have to times it by 2.
So I do 4 times 2 as well.

3 / 2x + 8 / 2x

~~3 + 8 is 11~~
~~2x + 2x is 4x~~ 
No, you don't add the bottom numbers once they are the same. 

3 + 8 = 11
Bottom stays as 2x.

So 11 / 2x. 

Final Answer: A
