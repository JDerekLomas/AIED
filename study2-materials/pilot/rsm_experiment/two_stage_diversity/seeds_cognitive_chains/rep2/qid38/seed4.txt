3 / 2x + 4 / x

The bottoms are different so I need to find a common denominator. 
Wait, if I just add the top and bottom...
3 + 4 = 7
2x + x = 3x
So maybe 7 / 3x?

No, sir said you have to make the denominators the same. 
To get x to be 2x, I have to multiply it by 2.
So I do 4 times 2 as well.

3 / 2x + 4(2) / 2x
= 3 / 2x + 8 / 2x

Now I just add the tops:
3 + 8 = 11

And the bottom is 2x + 2x = 4x
Wait, no, the bottom stays the same when you add fractions. 
Like 1/4 + 1/4 is 2/4 not 2/8.

So it's 11 / 2x.

Checking the options... 
A is 11/2x.
D is 7/2x. I got 11 because 3 + 8. 

Answer: A
