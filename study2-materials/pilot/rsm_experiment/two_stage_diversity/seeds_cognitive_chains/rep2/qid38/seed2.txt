3 / 2x + 4 / x

To add them you need the bottoms to be the same. 
The first one has 2x and the second one has x.

Um... so maybe multiply them together? 2x times x is 2x squared.
Wait no, I can just make the second one have 2x.

Multiply the 4/x by 2.
4 times 2 is 8.
So 8 / 2x.

Now add them up.
3 / 2x + 8 / 2x

Is it 11 / 4x?
No, the denominator stays the same when you add fractions. Like 1/4 + 1/4 is 2/4 not 2/8. 

So it's 11 over 2x.

~~3 + 4 = 7~~ 
~~7 / 3x~~

3 + 8 = 11.
The bottom is 2x.

Final answer: A
