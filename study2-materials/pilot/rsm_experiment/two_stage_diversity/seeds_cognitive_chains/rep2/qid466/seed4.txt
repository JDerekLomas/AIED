$-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$

Okay so I need to find what goes in the star.
I know that $3 \times 1 = 3$ so it's a fraction. 
If I multiply by the same number it's $\frac{9}{16}$ but that's not right.

Wait, to get $1$ you have to flip the fraction? Like the ressi... recipricol thing.
So if I have $\frac{3}{4}$ I need $\frac{4}{3}$ because the $3$s and $4$s cancel out.

$\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{12}{12} = 1$

But the question has minuses.
$- \frac{3}{4} \times \text{something} = -1$
If the answer is $-1$, then only one of the numbers can be negative. 
Because minus $\times$ minus = plus. 

So if the first one is already $-\frac{3}{4}$, then the star must be positive so the answer stays negative?
~~$- \times - = +$~~
$- \times + = -$

So the star is $\frac{4}{3}$

Wait, let me double check.
If I do $-\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{4}{3}$ that would be $+1$. But the question says $-1$.
So it's definitely the positive one.
