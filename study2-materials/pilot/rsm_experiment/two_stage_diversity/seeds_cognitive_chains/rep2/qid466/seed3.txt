Umm okay so.
$- \frac{3}{4} \times \text{something} = -1$

If I ignore the minus signs for a second it's just $\frac{3}{4} \times \star = 1$.
I know that to get 1 you have to multiply by the same number but flipped over. So like $\frac{3}{4}$ becomes $\frac{4}{3}$? 
Let me check. $3 \times 4 = 12$ and $4 \times 3 = 12$. $12 \div 12 = 1$. 
Yeah so it's $\frac{4}{3}$.

Wait, but there are minus signs. 
The question is $-\frac{3}{4}$ times something equals minus 1. 
~~A minus and a minus make a plus~~. 
If the answer is negative (-1), and the first bit is negative ($-\frac{3}{4}$), then the star must be a positive number. Because a minus times a plus is a minus. 

So it's not B. 

If it was $-\frac{4}{3}$ then the answer would be +1. But the answer is -1. 

So the star has to be positive $\frac{4}{3}$. 

$\frac{4}{3}$... is that A?

Let me just double check. 
$-0.75 \times 1.33 = -1$ 
Yeah that looks right. 

Answer: A
