Volume of a sphere... I think the formula is $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$. Or is it $4 \pi r^2$? No, that's surface area because it's squared. Cubed is for volume.

$V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$

I need to get $r$ by itself. 

First, move the 3. Since it's divide by 3, I multiply by 3.
$3V = 4 \pi r^3$

Now I need to get rid of the 4 and the $\pi$. 
Wait, do I subtract them? No, they are stuck to the $r$. So I divide.
$\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$

~~$r = \sqrt{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$~~
No, it's a little 3 for the root because it was $r$ cubed. 
So $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$

Let me look at the options.
A has $4V\pi$ at the top, that's wrong.
B has $3\pi$ at the bottom but I have $4\pi$.
C is $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$ - that matches mine.
D is just weirdly written with the root only on the V.

Check again... $3$ goes up, $4\pi$ goes down. Yeah.

Final answer: C
