Volume of a sphere... I remember this from the poster on the wall. 
It’s $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$

Wait, or is it $r^2$? No, volume is always cubed.
Okay so:
$V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$

I need to get $r$ by itself.
First, get rid of the $\frac{4}{3}$. 
I'll multiply by 4? No, it's divide by 3 so I multiply by 3.
$3V = 4 \pi r^3$

Now move the $4 \pi$.
It's $4 \times \pi \times r^3$ so I should divide them.
~~$3V - 4\pi = r^3$~~
$\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$

Now I need to get $r$. 
To get rid of a $^3$ you have to do a square root.
Wait, no, it's a cube root because it's a 3. 
$\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}} = r$

Let me check the options.
A has the 4 and the $\pi$ on top, so that's not it.
B has $3\pi$ on the bottom, but the $\pi$ was with the 4.
C looks right.
D has the cube root only on the $V$ part but the whole thing should be under it.

So it's C.

Answer: C
