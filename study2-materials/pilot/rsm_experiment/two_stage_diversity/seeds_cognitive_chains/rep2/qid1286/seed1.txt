Volume of a sphere... I think the formula is $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$.

I need to get $r$ by itself.
Step 1: Get rid of the fraction.
$\times 3$ on both sides.
$3V = 4 \pi r^3$

Wait, do I divide by 4 or 4$\pi$?
Probably divide by the $4\pi$ bit together.
$\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$

Now I need the opposite of cubed. Is it square root? 
No, cube root. The little 3 one $\sqrt[3]{ }$.

So $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$

Looking at the options:
A is $4V\pi / 3$ (upside down)
B is $4V / 3\pi$ (also upside down?)
C is $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$ — this matches mine.
D is different, the $\pi$ isn't under the root thing.

Wait, let me double check the formula. Is it $\frac{4}{3} \pi r^2$? 
No, area is squared, volume is always cubed. So $r^3$ is right.

$3V / 4\pi = r^3$
$r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$

Answer: C
