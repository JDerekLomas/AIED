Volume of a sphere... I think the formula is $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^2$?
No wait, it's volume so it must be cubed. 

$V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$

I need to get $r$ on its own.
First move the 3. It's divide on the bottom so it becomes times on the other side.
$3V = 4 \pi r^3$

Now I need to get rid of the 4 and the $\pi$.
$3V - 4\pi = r^3$
Wait, no, they are multiplied by $r$ so I have to divide them. 

$\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$

Now to get $r$ I need to do the square root.
$r = \sqrt{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$
Actually, it's power of 3, so it's a cube root.

$r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$

Looking at the options:
A is $4V\pi$ - wrong way up.
B is $4V$ on top - wrong.
C is $\frac{3V}{4\pi}$. This looks like mine.
D has the $4\pi$ outside the root, that's not right.

C

Final Answer: C
