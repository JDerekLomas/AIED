First I add the big numbers.
2 + 2 = 4

Now I need to do the fractions part: 
$\frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4}$

I can't just add them because the bottom numbers are different. Um, common denominator?
Is it 40? 10 times 4 is 40.

$\frac{7 \times 4}{10 \times 4} = \frac{28}{40}$
$\frac{1 \times 10}{4 \times 10} = \frac{10}{40}$

$\frac{28}{40} + \frac{10}{40} = \frac{38}{40}$

Wait, that looks big. Let me try 20 instead because 10, 20... and 4, 8, 12, 16, 20. Yeah 20 is better.

$\frac{7}{10}$ is $\frac{14}{20}$ (double it)
$\frac{1}{4}$ is... 4, 8, 12, 16, 20... that's times 5. So $\frac{5}{20}$.

$14 + 5 = 19$. 
So $\frac{19}{20}$.

Now put it back with the 4 from the start.
$4 \frac{19}{20}$

~~Check the question. Leave as mixed number.~~ 
A is a top heavy fraction so it's not that. 
D has 14 at the bottom because 10+4=14 but my teacher says you never add the bottom numbers.

The answer is B.

Final Answer: B
