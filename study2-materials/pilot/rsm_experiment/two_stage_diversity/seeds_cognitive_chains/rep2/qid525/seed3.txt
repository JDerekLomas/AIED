First I add the big numbers.
2 + 2 = 4

Then the fractions:
7/10 + 1/4

I need the same number on the bottom. Is it 40? 
10, 20, 30, 40...
4, 8, 12, 16, 20...
Wait, 20 is smaller. I'll use 20.

7/10: 10 goes into 20 two times. So 7 x 2 = 14. That's 14/20.
1/4: 4 goes into 20 five times. So 1 x 5 = 5. That's 5/20.

Now add them up:
14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20

~~So the answer is 4 and 19/20.~~

Wait, let me check the list. 
A is 99/20... let me see if mine is that.
4 x 20 = 80. 
80 + 19 = 99. 
So it's 99/20.

But the question says "Leave your answer as a mixed number". 
99/20 is an improper fraction.
So it must be B because it's the same but a mixed number.

I was going to pick D for a second because 7+1 is 8 and 10+4 is 14 but my teacher says you can't just add the bottoms.

Final answer: B
