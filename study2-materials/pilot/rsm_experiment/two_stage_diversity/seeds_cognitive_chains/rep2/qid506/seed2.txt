Your working:

3p = 1/12

I need to get p by itself so I have to move the 3.
Is it divide or multiply?? 
3 times p so opposite is divide.

p = 1/12 ÷ 3

~~p = 3/12~~ no that's not right.

I remember my teacher saying something about flip the fraction. 
Is it 1/12 x 3? 
No, that's 3/12 which is 1/4. 

Wait, it's 1/12 divided by 3/1.
Keep Change Flip... 
So 1/12 x 1/3

1 x 1 = 1
12 x 3... 
12, 24, 36.

So p = 1/36
