Your working:

3p = 1/12

I need to get p by itself so I have to move the 3.
Because it's 3 times p, I should ~~multiply~~ divide by 3.

p = 1/12 divided by 3

Umm...
12 / 3 is 4? 
So p = 1/4?

Wait, no. 
It’s a fraction. 1/12 ÷ 3
If you have a 12th and you split it three more times it gets smaller. 

Is it 12 x 3?
12, 24, 36.

So p = 1 / 36

Let me check... 3 x 1/36 = 3/36. 
If I simplify 3/36... 3 goes into 3 once and 3 goes into 36... 12 times.
Yeah, 1/12.
