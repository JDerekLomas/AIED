So, $y = 3x^2$

The $x$ is 0.3, so I need to put that in the formula.

$y = 3 \times 0.3^2$

I'll do $3 \times 0.3$ first? No, BIDMAS says do the squared bit first. 

$0.3^2 = 0.3 \times 0.3$

$3 \times 3 = 9$

So $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$
~~Wait~~ no, there are two decimal places?
$0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$ (yeah, because $3/10 \times 3/10$ is $9/100$)

So now I do $3 \times 0.09$

$3 \times 9 = 27$

Put the decimal back... it must be $0.27$ or $2.7$.
If it's $3 \times 0.09$ it should be a small number.

$0.09 + 0.09 + 0.09 = 0.27$

Checking the options. 0.27 is there.
Wait, did I do $3^2 \times 0.3$? 
$9 \times 0.3 = 2.7$
No, the square is only on the $x$. 

My first go was $0.27$.

Answer: B
