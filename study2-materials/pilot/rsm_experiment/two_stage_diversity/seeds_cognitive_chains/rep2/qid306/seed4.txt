Umm okay so.

Problem P is 4-5+6.
I remember BIDMAS... brackets, indices, division, multiplication, addition, subtraction.
So addition comes before subtraction in BIDMAS (the A is before the S).
So I should probably do 5 + 6 first?
Wait, if I do 5 + 6 that's 11. Then 4 - 11.
~~4 - 11 = -7~~
Wait, normally we just go left to right though? 4 - 5 is -1, then -1 + 6 is 5.
But the rule says Addition then Subtraction. A comes before S. So P must be 5 + 6.

Now Problem Q: 4 + 5 x 6.
Again, BIDMAS. Multiplication (M) is definitely before Addition (A).
So I have to do the 5 x 6 first.
5 x 6 = 30. 
Then 4 + 30 = 34.
If I did the other way it would be 9 x 6 = 54 which feels wrong.

So for P it's 5+6 because of the order of the letters.
And for Q it's 5 x 6 because multiplication is higher up.

Looking at the options...
D says P: 5+6 and Q: 5x6. That matches.

Answer: D
