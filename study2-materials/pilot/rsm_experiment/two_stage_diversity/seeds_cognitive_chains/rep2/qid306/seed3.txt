Umm okay so. BIDMAS.

I know the order is Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.

For Problem P: $4-5+6$.
Wait, addition comes before subtraction in BIDMAS (the A is before the S). So I have to do the $5+6$ first? 
Wait, if I do $5+6$ that’s 11, then $4-11$... that seems hard.
Actually, my teacher said something about just going left to right if it’s just plus and minus. 
Let me look again. 
A is Addition, S is Subtraction. So $5+6$ is the addition bit. 
Let's try: $4 - (5+6) = 4 - 11 = -7$. 
Or just go $4-5$ which is $-1$ then $+6$ is 5.
I think the "rule" says Addition first though? So $5+6$ first.

For Problem Q: $4+5 \times 6$.
BIDMAS again. Multiplication (M) is definitely before Addition (A). 
So I have to do $5 \times 6$ first. 
$5 \times 6 = 30$
Then $30+4 = 34$.
If I did $4+5$ first it would be $9 \times 6 = 54$. But M is before A. So $5 \times 6$ first.

So for P I'll go with the BIDMAS order (A before S) so $5+6$.
And for Q it's $5 \times 6$.

Let me double check the options.
Option D has $5+6$ and $5 \times 6$. 
Wait, usually we just go left to right for P... but BIDMAS says A then S. 
Actually, I remember doing a worksheet where someone got it wrong because they didn't do the adding first.

Answer: D
