Umm okay so.

Problem P is 4 - 5 + 6. 
For BIDMAS... B is brackets, I is indices, D is division, M is multiplication, A is addition, S is subtraction. 
So A comes before S?
So I should do 5 + 6 first.
Wait, no, if I do 5 + 6 that's 11... then 4 - 11? That doesn't seem right.
My teacher said you just go left to right if it's just plus and minus. 
So 4 - 5 = -1.
Then -1 + 6 = 5.
If I go left to right, I do 4 - 5 first.

Problem Q is 4 + 5 x 6.
BIDMAS again. 
Multiplication (M) is definitely before Addition (A). 
So I have to do 5 x 6 first.
5 x 6 is 30.
Then 4 + 30 = 34.
If I did 4 + 5 first it would be 9 x 6 which is 54. That's way different.
So for Q it must be 5 x 6.

So for P it's 4 - 5 (going across).
For Q it's 5 x 6 (because of the rule).

Let me check the options...
A says P: 4-5 and Q: 4+5. No, Q is wrong there.
B says P: 4-5 and Q: 5x6.
C says P: 5+6 and Q: 4+5.
D says P: 5+6 and Q: 5x6.

Wait, should P be 5+6? Because Addition comes before Subtraction in the word BIDMAS? 
~~5 + 6 = 11. 4 - 11 is minus 7.~~
Actually, last time we did this the teacher said they are "equal priority" or something. So I'll stick with 4-5. 

B looks like the right one.

Answer: B
