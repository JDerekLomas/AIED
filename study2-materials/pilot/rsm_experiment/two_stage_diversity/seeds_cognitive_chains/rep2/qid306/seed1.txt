Umm okay so.

Problem P is 4-5+6. I remember Bidmas (or Bodmas?). 
B bracket
I index
D divide
M multiply
A add
S subtract

So for P, add comes before subtract in the word BIDM**A****S**.
So I should do 5+6 first?
Wait, if I do 5+6 that is 11. Then 4 - 11 = -7. 
But if I just go left to right, 4-5 is -1, then -1+6 is 5.
Sir says you usually just go left to right for these ones but BIDMAS says A then S. 
I'll go with 5+6 for now because of the order of the letters. 

Problem Q: 4 + 5 x 6
Multiply comes before add definitely. M is before A.
So 5 x 6 first.
5 x 6 is 30. Then + 4 is 34.
If I did the other way 4+5 is 9, 9x6 is 54. That feels too big.
So definitely 5 x 6 first for Q.

Looking at the options...
Wait, if P is 5+6 and Q is 5x6 then that is option D.
Let me double check P. 
~~4 - 5 + 6~~ 
Maybe you just do the first one you see? My friend says you just do it in order. If it's just plus and minus it doesn't matter?
No, I'll stick with BIDMAS order. A comes before S. 

P: 5+6
Q: 5 x 6

Answer: D
