Right, BIDMAS. I remember this.

Problem P: $4 - 5 + 6$
The first bit is $4 - 5$. But then there is a plus. B-I-D-M-A-S... Addition comes before Subtraction.
So I should probably do $5 + 6$ first?
Wait, if I do $4 - 11$ that’s... no. 
Usually you just go across? $4 - 5$ is $-1$. 
But the rule says A before S. So $5 + 6 = 11$. Then $4 - 11 = -7$. 
Actually, my teacher said something about them being equal? But the list says A then S. So I'll go with $5 + 6$.

Problem Q: $4 + 5 \times 6$
B-I-D-M-A-S.
Multiply is definitely before Add.
So $5 \times 6 = 30$.
$4 + 30 = 34$.
If I did $4 + 5$ first it would be $9 \times 6 = 54$, which looks too big. 
So for Q it's definitely $5 \times 6$.

Looking at the options:
Problem P: I think it's $5 + 6$ because of the order of the letters.
Problem Q: It's $5 \times 6$.

So that's D?

~~Wait, if I just do P from left to right like a normal sum it's 4-5.~~
No, follow the rule. Addition then Subtraction.

Answer: D
