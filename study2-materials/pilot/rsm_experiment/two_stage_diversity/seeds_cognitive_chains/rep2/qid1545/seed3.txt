8 + 12 divided by 4... i do the 8+12 first i think?

$8 + 12 = 20$
$20 \div 4 = 5$

So the left side is 5.

Now the other side:
$(8 + 12) \div 4$
Brackets first. 
$8 + 12 = 20$
$20 \div 4 = 5$

Wait they both look the same. Is it C?

~~8+12 / 4~~

Wait, my teacher said something about BIDMAS. Division comes before plus.
Let me try again.

Left side:
$12 \div 4 = 3$
Then $8 + 3 = 11$
So the first one is 11.

Right side:
$(8+12)$ is in brackets so I HAVE to do that first even if there's a divide.
$8 + 12 = 20$
$20 \div 4 = 5$

So its $11 \square 5$.
11 is bigger than 5. 
The crocodile eats the bigger number.
