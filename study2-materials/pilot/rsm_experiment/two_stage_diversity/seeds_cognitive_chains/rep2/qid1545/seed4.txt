Right, so I need to see which side is bigger.

First side:
$8 + 12 \div 4$
Um, $8 + 12 = 20$
Then $20 \div 4 = 5$
Wait, no, I think there’s a rule for this. BIDMAS? 
Division comes before addition.
So, $12 \div 4 = 3$
Then $8 + 3 = 11$
Yeah, 11 sounds better.

Other side:
$(8 + 12) \div 4$
Brackets first! 
$8 + 12 = 20$
$20 \div 4 = \dots$ $4, 8, 12, 16, 20$ 
That's 5.

So the first bit is 11 and the second bit is 5.
11 is bigger than 5.
Which way does the arrow go? 
The crocodile eats the bigger number. 
$11 > 5$

Check:
$8 + 3 = 11$
~~$20 \div 4 = 4$~~ $5$

Answer is A

Final Answer: A
