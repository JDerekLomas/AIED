Right, let's see. 

Left side:
$8 + 12 \div 4$
Um, do I do $8 + 12$ first? That’s $20$.
$20 \div 4 = 5$.

Wait, BIDMAS. Or BODMAS?
Bracket, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.
So I have to do the divide first? 
$12 \div 4 = 3$.
Then $8 + 3 = 11$.
Yeah, that looks better. The left side is $11$.

Right side:
$(8 + 12) \div 4$
This one has brackets so I definitely do them first.
$8 + 12 = 20$.
Then $20 \div 4 = 5$.

So it's $11 \square 5$.
$11$ is bigger than $5$.

Which way does the arrow go?
~~$11 < 5$~~ 
No, the big end points to the big number. Like a crocodile.
So $11 > 5$.

Check again... 
Left side: $8+12 = 20 / 4 = 5$ 
No wait, I did that wrong the first time. It's division first. $12 \div 4$ is $3$, plus $8$ is $11$.
Right side: $(20) \div 4 = 5$.
$11$ is more than $5$.

Answer is A.
