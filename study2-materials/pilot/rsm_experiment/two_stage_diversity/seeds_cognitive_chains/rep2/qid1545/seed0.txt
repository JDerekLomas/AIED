Right, let's see. I need to figure out which side is bigger.

First side:
$8 + 12 \div 4$
Um, okay. $8+12$ is 20.
$20 \div 4 = 5$
Wait, no, I think there’s a rule for this. Bidmas? Bodmas? 
Dividing comes before adding.
So, it should be $12 \div 4$ first.
$12 \div 4 = 3$
Then $8 + 3 = 11$
Okay, so the left side is 11. 

Second side:
$(8 + 12) \div 4$
Brackets first.
$8 + 12 = 20$
$20 \div 4 = 5$

So the sides are 11 and 5.
11 is bigger than 5.
Which one is "bigger than"? 
Is it L for less than? No.
The crocodile eats the bigger number. 
$11 > 5$

~~Wait, did I do the first one right? $8+12$ is 20, $20/4$ is 5... no, Bidmas. Divide first.~~
Left side is 11. Right side is 5.
11 is bigger than 5. 

So it’s A.

Answer: A
