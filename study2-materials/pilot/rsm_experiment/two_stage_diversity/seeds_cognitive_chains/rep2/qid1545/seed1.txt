Right, let's see. 

Left side:
8 + 12 divided by 4.
So 8 + 12 is 20.
~~20 / 4 = 5~~
Wait, no. BIDMAS. I always forget if divide comes before plus. 
Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.
So divide first.
12 ÷ 4 = 3.
Then 8 + 3 = 11.
Okay, so the left side is 11.

Right side:
(8 + 12) ÷ 4
This one has brackets so I definitely do that first.
8 + 12 = 20.
Then 20 ÷ 4 = 5.

So...
Left is 11.
Right is 5.
11 is bigger than 5.
The symbol for bigger is the one that points that way... >. Like a crocodile eating the bigger number? Yeah.

Left side = 11
Right side = 5
11 > 5

Final Answer: A
