So, I need to add these two fractions.

$2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5}$

First I look at the whole numbers. 
$2 + 1 = 3$

Now the fraction parts. 
It’s $1/5$ and $2/5$.
The bottom numbers are 5 and 5, so I add them?
No, wait. $5 + 5$ is 10.
Wait, my teacher said something about the bottom staying the same if they match? 

Let's try:
$\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{10}$ (no, that feels wrong)

Actually, I’ll change them to improper fractions first to be safe, because I always mess up mixed numbers.
$2 \times 5 = 10$, then $+ 1$ is $11$. So $\frac{11}{5}$.
$1 \times 5 = 5$, then $+ 2$ is $7$. So $\frac{7}{5}$.

Now add them:
$\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5}$
$11 + 7 = 18$
And the bottom is $5 + 5$ is 10?
$\frac{18}{10}$?

Wait, C is $\frac{18}{10}$, but the question says leave as a mixed number. 
If I use $18/5$...
How many 5s go into 18?
$5, 10, 15$... that’s $3$ lots. 
And there is $3$ left over.
So $3 \frac{3}{5}$.

Is it A or D? 
If I add the tops $1+2=3$ and the bottoms $5+5=10$, I get $3 \frac{3}{10}$.
But if I keep the bottom the same I get $3 \frac{3}{5}$.
I think I'll go with the first one I saw that looked like my $18/5$ thing.

Final Answer: A
