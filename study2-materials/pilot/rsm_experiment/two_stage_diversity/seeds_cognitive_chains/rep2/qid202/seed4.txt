So, 2 1/5 add 1 2/5. 

First I add the big numbers.
$2 + 1 = 3$

Now the fractions part. 
$1/5 + 2/5$ 
Is it $3/10$? Wait.

No, when you add fractions you don't add the bottom numbers do you?
~~$1/5 + 2/5 = 3/10$~~

Okay, the denominator stays the same. So $1 + 2 = 3$ and the bottom is 5.
So that is $3/5$.

Putting it together...
$3$ and $3/5$

Let me check the options.
A is $3 \frac{3}{5}$
B is $18/5$... wait is that the same?
$3 \times 5 = 15$
$15 + 3 = 18$
So it's $18/5$ too?

The question says "mixed number". $18/5$ is a top-heavy fraction, not a mixed one.
A looks right. 

I'll just double check the denominator again. Sometimes you add them?
$5 + 5 = 10$... no, that's only for something else.
It's definitely 5.

Answer: A
