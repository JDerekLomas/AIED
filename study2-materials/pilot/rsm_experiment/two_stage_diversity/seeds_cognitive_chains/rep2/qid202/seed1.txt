So, first you add the big numbers.
2 + 1 = 3

Then the fractions are 1/5 and 2/5.
1/5 + 2/5 = 3/10 ???
No, wait. When you add the bottom numbers you don't do that. Or do you? 
If it's a pizza... one slice out of five plus two slices out of five is three slices.
So it's 3/5. 

So the big number is 3 and the little part is 3/5.
The answer is 3 3/5. 

Wait, let me double check because I always mess up fractions.
$2 \times 5 = 10$, $+1 = 11$. So $11/5$.
$1 \times 5 = 5$, $+2 = 7$. So $7/5$.
$11 + 7 = 18$.
So it's $18/5$. 

Choice B is 18/5.
But the question says "leave your answer as a mixed number".
$18 \div 5$... 5, 10, 15... that's 3 times with 3 left over.
So $3 \frac{3}{5}$. 

A looks right. I thought maybe D because 5+5 is 10 but my teacher says you keep the denominator the same.

Answer: A
