So, I need to add these two fractions.

First, look at the big numbers. $2 + 1 = 3$. 

Now the fraction bits. 
$\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}$

Umm, so $1 + 2 = 3$. 
And for the bottom part... $5 + 5 = 10$?
No, wait, my teacher said something about the bottom staying the same if they are the same already. 

So it's either $3/5$ or $3/10$.
If I do $1/5 + 2/5$... it's 3 bits of a 5-piece pizza. 

Let's try:
$2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5}$
$2 + 1 = 3$
$\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$

So $3 \frac{3}{5}$.

Wait, let me double check because B and C look weird. 
Is $3 \frac{3}{5}$ the same as $18/5$?
$3 \times 5 = 15$
$15 + 3 = 18$
Yeah, $18/5$. 

But the question says "leave your answer as a mixed number".
So $3 \frac{3}{5}$ is the mixed one. 
A or D? 
I'm pretty sure you don't add the bottom numbers. If I had a fifth and two fifths, I'd have three fifths, not three tenths. Three tenths is smaller. That doesn't make sense.

Working:
$2 + 1 = 3$
$1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5$
Answer = $3 \frac{3}{5}$

Choice: A
