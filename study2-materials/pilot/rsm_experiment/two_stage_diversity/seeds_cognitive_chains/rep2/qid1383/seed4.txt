So we have $T = k^4$ and $k$ is $-3$.

Working:
$k = -3$
So $T = -3^4$

$3 \times 4 = 12$
wait no, its power of 4 not times 4. 

$T = -3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$
$3 \times 3 = 9$
$9 \times 3 = 27$
$27 \times 3 = \dots$ 
$20 \times 3 = 60$
$7 \times 3 = 21$
$60 + 21 = 81$

Now is it positive or negative? 
$-3 \times -3$ is $9$
$9 \times -3$ is $-27$
$-27 \times -3$ is $\dots$ 

ummm I think because there's a minus in the question it stays minus?
Actually, the calculator usually says minus if you dont put brackets. 
$-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$
$- \times - = +$
$- \times - = +$
Oh, so it should be positive 81.

Wait, but sometimes its -81 if you do it on a calculator without brackets. I'll just go with 81 because two minuses make a plus.

Final Answer: A
