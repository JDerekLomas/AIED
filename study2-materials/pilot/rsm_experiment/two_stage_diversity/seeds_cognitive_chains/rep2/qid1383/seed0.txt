So we have $T = k^4$ and $k$ is $-3$.

Working:
$T = -3^4$
This means $-3 \times 4$? No, wait, that's $3 \times 4 = 12$ so it could be $-12$.
But the small 4 means power, like timesing it by itself.

So it is $-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$
$3 \times 3 = 9$
$9 \times 3 = 27$
$27 \times 3 =$ ... 
$20 \times 3 = 60$
$7 \times 3 = 21$
$60 + 21 = 81$

Now the signs. 
$-3 \times -3 = 9$ (minus and minus makes a plus)
$9 \times -3 = -27$
$-27 \times -3 = \dots$
Two minuses make a plus again? 
~~Wait, if there are four minuses, is it negative?~~
I think because the 3 is negative it stays negative?

Actually, $3 \times 4$ is 12 and there's a minus sign. D looks right too.
But powers are bigger. I'll go with 81 because $3^4$ is definitely 81.
Wait, $-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3 \dots$ 
Pair 1: $-3 \times -3 = 9$
Pair 2: $-3 \times -3 = 9$
$9 \times 9 = 81$

Wait, if I put it in a calculator sometimes it says -81. Let me think.
$-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$
If it's $-(3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3)$ then it is $-81$.
I'll pick C because the number was negative at the start.

Answer: C
