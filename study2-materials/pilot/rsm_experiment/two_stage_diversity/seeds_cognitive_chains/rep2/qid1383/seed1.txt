So we have $T = k^4$ and $k$ is -3.

Wait, does the power go inside or outside the minus? 
$T = -3^4$

Okay so $3 \times 4 = 12$? 
No, that's $3 \times 4$. The little 4 means timesing it by itself.

$3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$
$3 \times 3 = 9$
$9 \times 3 = 27$
$27 \times 3 \dots$ 
$20 \times 3 = 60$
$7 \times 3 = 21$
$60 + 21 = 81$

So it's either 81 or -81.
The sum is $-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$.
A minus and a minus make a plus.
So $-3 \times -3 = 9$
Then $9 \times -3 = -27$
Then $-27 \times -3 = \dots$ minus and minus makes a plus again.
So it stays as 81?

Let me double check.
~~-3 \times 4 = -12~~
No, that's not right.

If the power is 4, that's an even number, so the minus signs cancel out.
- - is +
- - is +
So it must be positive.

Answer: A) 81
