Here is my working out:

$\frac{x}{3}-5=12$

To get rid of the $-5$, I have to move it to the other side.
When it moves across it becomes a plus.
So $12+5 = 17$
That means $\frac{x}{3}=17$
Tom looks right.

Now checking Katie.
She has $x-5=36$. 
Wait, she multiplied by 3 because $12 \times 3 = 36$.
$\frac{x}{3} \times 3$ is just $x$. 
~~So $x-5 = 36$~~ 
But wait, if you multiply by 3 you have to do it to everything.
I remember my teacher saying you have to multiply every bit.
So the $-5$ should also be multiplied by 3?
$5 \times 3 = 15$
So it should be $x - 15 = 36$
Katie didn't multiply the 5, she just did the $x$ and the 12. 
So Katie is wrong because she missed out the 5.

Tom did the add 5 first which works.
