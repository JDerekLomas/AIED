Here is my working for this question:

$\frac{x}{3}-5=12$

To get rid of the $-5$ I need to do the opposite which is plus.
$12 + 5 = 17$
So $\frac{x}{3} = 17$. 
This looks right because Tom moved the 5 to the other side. So Tom is definitely right.

Now I have to look at Katie. 
$\frac{x}{3}-5=12$
She has $x - 5 = 36$.
I think she timesed by 3 to get rid of the divide by 3? 
$12 \times 3 = 36$
But she still has the $-5$. 
~~If you times everything by 3 then $5 \times 3 = 15$.~~ 
Wait, if she timesed the 12 by 3 to get 36, then the $x$ is on its own now. 
But she didn't times the 5. 
Usually you just do one thing at a time. Tom did the plus first, which is what my teacher says to do (S-A-M-D-E-B or something).

If Tom is right, Katie must be wrong because you can't have two different next lines. 
Wait, actually, you can sometimes. 
But if you multiply by 3, you have to multiply *everything* by 3. 
So $x - 15 = 36$. 
Katie just left it as $-5$. So she forgot to multiply the 5.

So only Tom is right.
