To solve $\frac{x}{3}-5=12$

Let's look at what Tom says first.
Tom has $\frac{x}{3}=17$. 
He moved the -5 to the other side.
When you move a minus, it becomes a plus.
So $12 + 5 = 17$. 
That looks right because you have to get the $x$ bit by itself first.

Now let's look at Katie.
She has $x-5=36$.
She multiplied by 3 because of the divide by 3 under the $x$.
$12 \times 3 = 36$.
But wait, if you multiply by 3, you have to do it to everything.
She didn't multiply the -5. 
Wait, maybe you don't have to? 
~~$x - 15 = 36$~~ 
Actually, I remember my teacher saying you have to do the same thing to *everything* on both sides. If Katie multiplied by 3, the -5 should have changed too. 
So she should have written $x - 15 = 36$.

Let me check Tom again. 
$\frac{x}{3} = 17$
Then $x = 17 \times 3$.
$10 \times 3 = 30$
$7 \times 3 = 21$
$30 + 21 = 51$.
Let me check that: $51 \div 3 = 17$. $17 - 5 = 12$. 
Yeah, Tom is definitely right.

Katie's way is $x-5=36$, so $x = 41$. 
Check: $41 \div 3$... that's not a whole number. 41 isn't in the 3 times table.
So Katie's line must be wrong because she forgot to multiply the 5.

Final answer: A (Only Tom)

A) Only Tom
