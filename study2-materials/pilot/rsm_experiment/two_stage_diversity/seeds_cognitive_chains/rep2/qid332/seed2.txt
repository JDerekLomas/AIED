Here is how a typical Year 9 student might approach this:

x/3 - 5 = 12

First I need to move the -5. To move it I have to do the opposite, so +5.
12 + 5 = 17.
So $x/3 = 17$. 
Wait, that’s what Tom said. So Tom is definitely right. 

Now look at Katie. 
She has $x-5=36$.
She's tried to get rid of the divide by 3. 
To get rid of /3 you multiply by 3. 
$12 \times 3 = 36$.
So $x - 5 = 36$. 
~~This looks okay?~~
Wait, if you multiply the whole thing by 3, you have to do the 5 as well? 
$3 \times 5 = 15$.
So it should be $x - 15 = 36$. 
Katie forgot to multiply the 5. She only multiplied the x/3 and the 12. 
Actually, I’m not sure. In class we usually move the 5 first anyway.
Tom's way is the normal way.
$12 + 5 = 17$.
$17 \times 3 = 51$.

Katie’s line $x-5=36$ looks like she just skipped the 5. You can't just ignore it.

So only Tom.
