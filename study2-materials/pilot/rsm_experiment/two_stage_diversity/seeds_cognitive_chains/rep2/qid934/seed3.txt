Your working:

Right, okay. $x = 0$ is what it wants because that's what is above the star.

The equation is $4x + 2y = 10$.

So I put $0$ where the $x$ is. 
$40 + 2y = 10$  No wait, it's not forty, it's $4$ times $0$.
$4 \times 0 + 2y = 10$
$4 \times 0$ is $0$.

So $2y = 10$

Um, so $y$ is $10$ divided by $2$. 
$10 / 2 = 5$

Wait, let me check the question again. Is it $y = 10 - 4$? No.
Maybe I was supposed to add the $4$ and $2$ first? 
$4 + 2 = 6$
$6x = 10$
No that doesn't make sense.

If $x$ is $0$, then that whole $4x$ bit just disappears. 
So $2$ times something is $10$. 
$2, 4, 6, 8, 10$ - that's $5$.

Is $5$ an option? Yes, it's C. 
Is it D? $10$ divided by $4$ is $2.5$... no that's if $y$ was $0$. 

I'll go with $5$.

Final Answer: C
