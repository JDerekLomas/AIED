Your working:

Okay, so the table has $x$ and $y$. The star is under the $0$. So $x$ is $0$.

The equation is $4x + 2y = 10$. 

If $x$ is $0$, then it's $40 + 2y = 10$.
Wait, no. It’s $4 \times 0$.
Anything times zero is zero.
So $0 + 2y = 10$.

Now I need to find $y$.
$2y = 10$
To get $y$ on its own, I think I take away $2$?
$10 - 2 = 8$. 

Is $8$ there? No. 
Let me try again.
$2$ lots of something makes $10$.
$2, 4, 6, 8, 10$. 
That's $5$.

Wait, I should check the other ones to be sure. 
If $x$ is $1$... 
$4(1) + 2y = 10$
$4 + 2y = 10$
$2y = 6$
$y = 3$. 
The next box would be $3$. 

If $x=0$, $y=5$. 

Let me re-read... "What should replace the star?"
Star is at $x=0$.
So $2y = 10$
$10 \div 2 = 5$.
