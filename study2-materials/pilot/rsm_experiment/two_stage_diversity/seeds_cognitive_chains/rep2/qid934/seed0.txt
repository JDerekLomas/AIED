Your working:

Okay, so the equation is $4x + 2y = 10$.
I need to find the star, and the star is under the $x=0$ column.

So if $x$ is $0$...
$40 + 2y = 10$?
No wait, it's not forty, it's $4 \times 0$.

$4 \times 0 + 2y = 10$
$0 + 2y = 10$
So $2y = 10$.

Um, what do I do now? I think I need to move the 2?
$y = 10 - 2$
~~$y = 8$~~ (wait, 8 isn't an option)

Let me try again.
$2 \times$ something equals $10$.
$2 \times 5 = 10$.

Wait, let me double check the first bit.
If $x=0$, then $4 \times 0$ is definitely $0$.
So $2y$ has to be $10$ to make the whole thing equal $10$.
Half of $10$ is $5$.

Is it $2.5$? No, $2.5$ is half of $5$. 
The question asks for $y$.
$2y = 10$
$10 \div 2 = 5$.

Wait, did I add them? $4 + 2 = 6$... no.
If $x$ was $1$, it would be $4(1) + 2y = 10$... $4 + 2y = 10$... $2y = 6$... $y=3$. 
But the star is under $0$.
So when $x=0$, $y=5$.

C seems right.
