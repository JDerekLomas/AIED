Your working:

So I need the star for when x is 0. 

Equation is $4x + 2y = 10$

If x is 0 then it's $40 + 2y = 10$?
No wait, $x$ is 0 so it's $4 \times 0$.
$4 \times 0 = 4$  $\leftarrow$ wait no anything times 0 is 0.

So $0 + 2y = 10$
$2y = 10$

So $y$ must be $10 - 2$ which is 8? 
That's not one of the answers. 

Let me try again. 
$2y = 10$
$y = 10 \div 2$

Half of 10 is 5.

Let me check the table again.
If x is 1: $4(1) + 2y = 10$
$4 + 2y = 10$
$2y = 6$, so $y=3$.

So when $x=0$, $y=5$. 
When $x=1$, $y=3$. 
It’s going down by 2 each time. 

The star is the first one.

Final Answer: C
