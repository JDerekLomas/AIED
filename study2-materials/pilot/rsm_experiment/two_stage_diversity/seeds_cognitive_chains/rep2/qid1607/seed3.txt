**Your working:**

$15 = \frac{1+k}{4}$

Okay, I need to get $k$ on its own.
Isaac's first step he did $15 \times 4$.
$15 + 15$ is 30, and $30 + 30$ is 60. So $60 = 1 + k$.
Yeah, that looks right because you move the $\div 4$ over and it becomes a times. So step 1 is fine.

Now step 2: $61 = k$.
Wait, if $60 = 1 + k$...
To get $k$ I need to move the 1.
~~$60 + 1$~~
No, it’s plus 1 on that side, so it should be minus on the other side?
$60 - 1 = 59$.
Isaac put 61. He probably did $60 + 1$ instead of take away. I always do that.

So step 1 is right but step 2 is wrong.
Wait, let me double check. $15 \times 4 = 60$. Correct.
Then $1+k=60$. If $k$ was 61, then $1+61$ is 62. Not 60.
So step 2 is definitely wrong.

A is only step 1.
