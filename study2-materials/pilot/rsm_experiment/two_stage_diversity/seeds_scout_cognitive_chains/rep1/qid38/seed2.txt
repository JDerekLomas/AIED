To write this as a single fraction as simply as possible, I'll start by... um... trying to get a common denominator, I think.

So, I've got \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\). Hmm, if I make the second fraction have a denominator of \(2x\), that would be good, right?

So, \(\frac{4}{x}\) is the same as \(\frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{8}{2x}\).

Now I've got \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}\).

## Step 1: Add the fractions
I can add these now because they have the same denominator. So, \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}\).

## 2: Simplify if possible
I don't think I can simplify \(\frac{11}{2x}\) any further because 11 is a prime number and it doesn't share any common factors with \(2x\).

## 3: Check the answer choices
Looking at the options... A) \(\frac{11}{2x}\), B) \(\frac{7}{3x}\), C) \(\frac{11}{x}\), D) \(\frac{7}{2x}\)... my answer matches option A.

The best answer is A.
