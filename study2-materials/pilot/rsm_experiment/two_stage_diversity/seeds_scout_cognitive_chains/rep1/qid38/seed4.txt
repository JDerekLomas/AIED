To write this as a single fraction, I need to get a common denominator for both fractions. Um, so the denominators are 2x and x... 

So, I'll make the denominators the same... I'll multiply the second fraction by 2/2, so it becomes:

\[
\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \times \frac{2}{2}
\]

which is 

\[
\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}
\]

Now I can add them:

\[
\frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}
\]

Hmm, that's it, right? I think I got it...

So, my answer is: A) \( \frac{11}{2 x} \)
