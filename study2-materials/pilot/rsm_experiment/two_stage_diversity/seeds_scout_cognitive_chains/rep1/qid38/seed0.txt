To write this as a single fraction, I need to get a common denominator...

So, the first one is \( \frac{3}{2x} \) and the second one is \( \frac{4}{x} \).

To get a common denominator, I'll multiply the second fraction by... uh... 2.

So, \( \frac{4}{x} \) becomes \( \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{8}{2x} \).

The first one is already \( \frac{3}{2x} \).

Now I can add them: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \).

Wait, that's it! I think...

So, my answer is... A) \( \frac{11}{2x} \).

Yep, I'm pretty sure that's right.
