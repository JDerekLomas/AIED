To add these fractions, I need to find a common denominator... um... so it's \(2x\) and \(x\), and \(2x\) is the one that has \(x\) and an extra \(2\), so I'll make the denominators the same by multiplying the top and bottom of the second fraction by \(2\)... I think.

So, I have:
\[
\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2}
\]

Let me write that out...

\[
= \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}
\]

Now I can add them...

\[
= \frac{3 + 8}{2x}
\]

Adding \(3 + 8\)... that's \(11\). So,

\[
= \frac{11}{2x}
\]

Hmm, does that look right? It seems simple enough. I don't see any other way to simplify it...

The answer is A.
