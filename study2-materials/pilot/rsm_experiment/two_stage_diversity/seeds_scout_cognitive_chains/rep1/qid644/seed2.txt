## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets (2p-1)(3p-4). The arrows point to -1 and -4.

## 2: Recall the rule for multiplying terms
To multiply terms, I just multiply the numbers together. If both numbers are negative, the result is positive. If one is negative and the other is positive, the result is negative.

## 3: Multiply -1 and -4
So, -1 * -4 = ... um... I think if two negatives multiply, it's a positive... So, -1 * -4 = +4.

## 4: Write down the answer
The answer must be +4.

## 5: Choose the correct option
Looking at the options: A) +4, B) -4, C) +5, D) -5. My answer matches option A.

The best answer is A.
