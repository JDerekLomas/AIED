## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets (2p-1)(3p-4). The arrows are pointing at the -1 in the first bracket and the -4 in the second bracket.

## 2: Multiply the terms
To find the product, I multiply -1 and -4. I remember that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result.

## 3: Perform the calculation
-1 * -4 = 4

## 4: Write down the result
So, when I multiply -1 and -4, I get 4.

## 5: Choose the correct answer
Since I got 4, which is a positive number, I look for the answer that matches. I see that A says +4.

The best answer is A.
