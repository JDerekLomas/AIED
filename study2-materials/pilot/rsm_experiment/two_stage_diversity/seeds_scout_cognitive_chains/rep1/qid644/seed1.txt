## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets (2p-1) and (3p-4). The arrows point to -1 in the first bracket and -4 in the second bracket.

## 2: Multiply the terms
To find the product, I multiply -1 by -4. I remember that multiplying two negatives gives a positive.

## 3: Perform the multiplication
-1 * -4 = 4. I'm pretty sure that's right because, yeah, two negatives make a positive.

## 4: Write down the answer
So, when I multiply -1 and -4, I get +4.

## 5: Choose the correct option
Looking at the options: A) +4, B) -4, C) +5, D) -5, I think the answer is A) +4.

The best answer is A.
