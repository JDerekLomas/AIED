## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets (2p-1)(3p-4). The arrows are pointing at the -1 in the first bracket and the -4 in the second bracket.

## 2: Multiply the terms
To find the product, I multiply -1 by -4. I'm not really sure if I'm doing this right, but I think when you multiply two negatives, you get a positive?

## 3: Perform the multiplication
-1 * -4 = 4. Yeah, that makes sense. When you multiply two minuses, you get a plus.

## 4: Write down the answer
So, the answer is +4.

## 5: Choose the correct option
Looking at the options: A) +4, B) -4, C) +5, D) -5. I think I got it right, so the answer is A) +4.

The best answer is A.
