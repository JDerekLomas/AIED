## Step 1: Convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions
First, I need to convert \(2 \frac{7}{10}\) and \(2 \frac{1}{4}\) into improper fractions. For \(2 \frac{7}{10}\), I do \(2 \times 10 + 7 = 20 + 7 = 27\), so it's \(\frac{27}{10}\). For \(2 \frac{1}{4}\), I do \(2 \times 4 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9\), so it's \(\frac{9}{4}\).

## 2: Find a common denominator for the improper fractions
To add \(\frac{27}{10}\) and \(\frac{9}{4}\), I need a common denominator. The denominators are 10 and 4, so I think the least common multiple (LCM) of 10 and 4 is... 20. Yeah, that's right.

## 3: Convert the improper fractions to have the common denominator
Now, I convert \(\frac{27}{10}\) and \(\frac{9}{4}\) to have a denominator of 20. For \(\frac{27}{10}\), I multiply the top and bottom by 2 to get \(\frac{27 \times 2}{10 \times 2} = \frac{54}{20}\). For \(\frac{9}{4}\), I multiply the top and bottom by 5 to get \(\frac{9 \times 5}{4 \times 5} = \frac{45}{20}\).

## 4: Add the fractions
Next, I add \(\frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20}\). That's \(\frac{54 + 45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}\).

## 5: Convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number
To convert \(\frac{99}{20}\) into a mixed number, I divide 99 by 20. 20 goes into 99... 4 times with a remainder of 19. So, it's \(4 \frac{19}{20}\).

## 6: Choose the correct answer
Looking at the options, I see \(4 \frac{19}{20}\) matches option B.

The best answer is B.
