## Step 1: Convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions
To add these mixed numbers, \( 2 \frac{7}{10} \) and \( 2 \frac{1}{4} \), I should first convert them into improper fractions. For \( 2 \frac{7}{10} \), I do \( 2 \times 10 + 7 = 20 + 7 = 27 \), so it's \( \frac{27}{10} \). For \( 2 \frac{1}{4} \), I do \( 2 \times 4 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \), so it's \( \frac{9}{4} \).

## 2: Find a common denominator for the fractions
Now, I need to find a common denominator for \( \frac{27}{10} \) and \( \frac{9}{4} \). The denominators are 10 and 4. Um, what are the multiples of 10 and 4? ... 10, 20, 30... and 4, 8, 12, 16, 20... Ah, 20 is the first one that appears in both lists, so 20 is the common denominator.

## 3: Convert fractions to have the common denominator
I'll convert \( \frac{27}{10} \) and \( \frac{9}{4} \) to have a denominator of 20. For \( \frac{27}{10} \), I multiply the top and bottom by 2 to get \( \frac{27 \times 2}{10 \times 2} = \frac{54}{20} \). For \( \frac{9}{4} \), I multiply the top and bottom by 5 to get \( \frac{9 \times 5}{4 \times 5} = \frac{45}{20} \).

## 4: Add the fractions
Now, I add them: \( \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} \).

## 5: Convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number
To convert \( \frac{99}{20} \) into a mixed number, I divide 99 by 20. 20 goes into 99... um... 4 times with a remainder, I think. \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \), and \( 99 - 80 = 19 \). So, it's \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \).

## 6: Choose the correct answer
Looking at the options, I see \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \) which matches my answer.

The best answer is B.
