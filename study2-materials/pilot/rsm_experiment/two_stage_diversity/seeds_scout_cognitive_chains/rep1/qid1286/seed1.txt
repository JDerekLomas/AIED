## Step 1: Recall the formula for the volume of a sphere
The formula for the volume of a sphere is \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \), where \( V \) is the volume and \( r \) is the radius.

## Step 2: Rearrange the formula to solve for \( r \)
To find \( r \), we need to rearrange the formula. First, I'll multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction: \( 3V = 4 \pi r^3 \).

## 3: Isolate \( r^3 \)
Next, I'll divide both sides by \( 4 \pi \) to isolate \( r^3 \): \( \frac{3V}{4 \pi} = r^3 \).

## 4: Solve for \( r \)
To solve for \( r \), I need to take the cube root of both sides: \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4 \pi}} \).

## 5: Compare with the given options
Now, I'll compare my solution with the options given:
- A: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \)
- B: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \)
- C: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \)
- D: \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \)

## 6: Choose the correct option
My solution \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4 \pi}} \) matches option C.

The best answer is C.
