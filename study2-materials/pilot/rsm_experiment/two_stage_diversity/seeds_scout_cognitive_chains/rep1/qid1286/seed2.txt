## Step 1: Recall the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

## Step 2: Rearrange the formula to solve for \(r\)
To find \(r\), we need to rearrange the formula. First, I'll multiply both sides by \(\frac{3}{4}\) to get \(\frac{3}{4}V = \pi r^3\).

## 3: Isolate \(r^3\)
Next, I'll divide both sides by \(\pi\) to isolate \(r^3\): \(\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3\).

## 4: Solve for \(r\)
To solve for \(r\), I take the cube root of both sides: \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\).

## 5: Compare with the given options
Looking at the options provided:
- A: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V\pi}{3}}\)
- B: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}\)
- C: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\)
- D: \(\frac{3\sqrt[3]{V}}{4\pi}\)

## 6: Choose the correct option
My derivation matches option C: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\).

The best answer is C.
