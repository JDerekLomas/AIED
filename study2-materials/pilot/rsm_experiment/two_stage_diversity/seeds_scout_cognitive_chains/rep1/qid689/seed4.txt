To solve the equation \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\), I need to get \(p\) on its own.

First, I'll multiply both sides by \(p\)... I think. Yeah, that's right.

\(10p = 5\)

Okay, now I need to get \(p\) by itself. Um, I'll divide both sides by 10.

\(p = \frac{5}{10}\)

\(p = 0.5\)

Wait, is that right? Let me check... If \(p = 0.5\), then \(\frac{5}{p} = \frac{5}{0.5} = 10\). Yeah, that looks good.

So, \(p = 0.5\). That's option... A.

The final answer is A.
