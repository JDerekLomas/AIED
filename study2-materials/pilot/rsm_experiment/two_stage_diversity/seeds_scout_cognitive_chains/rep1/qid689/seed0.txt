## Step 1: Understand the equation
The equation given is \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\). I need to solve for \(p\).

## 2: Multiply both sides by \(p\)
To get rid of the fraction, I'll multiply both sides by \(p\). This gives me \(10p = 5\).

## 3: Divide both sides by 10
Now, I'll divide both sides by 10 to solve for \(p\). So, \(p = \frac{5}{10}\).

## 4: Simplify the fraction
\(\frac{5}{10}\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 5. This gives me \(p = \frac{1}{2}\).

## 5: Convert the fraction to a decimal
\(\frac{1}{2}\) as a decimal is \(0.5\).

## 6: Compare with the given options
Looking at the options: A) \(p = 0.5\), B) \(p = 50\), C) \(p = 2\), D) There are no solutions. My answer \(p = 0.5\) matches option A.

The best answer is A.
