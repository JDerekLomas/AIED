## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\).

## Step 2: Try to isolate p
To isolate \(p\), I need to get rid of the fraction. I think I can do that by... um... multiplying both sides by \(p\)? So, I get \(10p = 5\).

## 3: Solve for p
Now, I need to solve for \(p\). I'll divide both sides by 10 to get \(p = \frac{5}{10}\).

## 4: Simplify the fraction
\(\frac{5}{10}\) can be simplified by... dividing both the top and the bottom by 5, I think? So, \(p = \frac{1}{2}\).

## 5: Convert the fraction to a decimal for comparison with the answer choices
\(\frac{1}{2}\) is equal to 0.5. So, \(p = 0.5\).

## 6: Compare with the answer choices
Looking at the answer choices, I see \(p = 0.5\) matches option A.

The best answer is A.
