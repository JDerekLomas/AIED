## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\).

## Step 2: Try to isolate p
To isolate \(p\), I need to get rid of the fraction. I think I can do that by multiplying both sides by \(p\), which gives \(10p = 5\).

## 3: Solve for p
Now, I need to solve for \(p\). I will divide both sides by 10 to get \(p = \frac{5}{10}\).

## 4: Simplify the fraction
\(\frac{5}{10}\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 5, which gives \(p = 0.5\).

## 5: Check the answer choices
Looking at the answer choices, I see \(p = 0.5\), which matches option A.

## 6: Verify if p = 0.5 is a valid solution
If \(p = 0.5\), then \(\frac{5}{p} = \frac{5}{0.5} = 10\), which is correct.

## 7: Conclusion
So, my answer is \(p = 0.5\), which is option A.

The best answer is A.
