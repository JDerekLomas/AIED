To solve this, I need to remember what the division and algebraic conventions are...

Okay, so \( c \div(h+4) \), this means I'm dividing \( c \) by \( h+4 \)...

Hmm... I think it's like... when you divide by a bracket, you just put it as a fraction? So...

\( c \div(h+4) = \frac{(h+4)}{c} \) no, wait... that's not right...

 crossing that out... 

\( c \div(h+4) = \frac{c}{(h+4)} \)

That's it! But is that an option? Let me check...

A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \) Oh, that's exactly what I wrote!

B) \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \) That's adding 4 to c... no...

C) \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \) That's defo not right... you're adding 4 and also dividing by h...

D) \( \frac{h+4}{c} \) That's the other way around... no...

Okay, confident...

The answer is A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \).
