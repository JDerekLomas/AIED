To find the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \), I'll go through it step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the Problem
The problem is asking me to find the correct way to write \( c \div(h+4) \) using algebraic notation.

## 2: Recall Division in Algebra
In algebra, division can be represented as a fraction. So, \( c \div(h+4) \) should be written with \( c \) as the numerator and \( (h+4) \) as the denominator.

## 3: Write It Down
So, \( c \div(h+4) = \frac{c}{h+4} \).

## 4: Compare with Options
Let me compare this with the given options:
- A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)
- B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)
- C: \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)
- D: \( \frac{h+4}{c} \)

## 5: Check for Errors
Wait, did I do that right? I think I did... Let me recheck. \( c \div(h+4) \) means \( c \) divided by \( h+4 \), which I've written as \( \frac{c}{h+4} \). That looks right to me.

## 6: Select the Correct Option
My working shows that \( c \div(h+4) = \frac{c}{h+4} \), which matches option A.

The best answer is A.
