To find the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \), I'll go through it step by step...

## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem is asking me to rewrite \( c \div(h+4) \) using the correct algebraic convention. I think that means using brackets and stuff properly.

## 2: Recall algebraic conventions
I'm pretty sure that division in algebra can be shown as a fraction, like \( a \div b = \frac{a}{b} \). So, \( c \div(h+4) \) would be... um... \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)?

## 3: Check the options
Let me look at the options:
- A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)
- B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)
- C: \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)
- D: \( \frac{h+4}{c} \)

## 4: Compare with my working
My working was \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which matches option A. I think that's right because... well, it looks right.

## 5: Quickly check other options for errors
- B looks wrong because it adds 4 to c, which isn't what the question says.
- C looks wrong because it adds 4 to \( \frac{c}{h} \), not what we want.
- D looks wrong because it flips c and \( h+4 \), and that's not right.

## 6: Conclude
Yeah, A looks good. I'm going to choose A.

The best answer is A.
