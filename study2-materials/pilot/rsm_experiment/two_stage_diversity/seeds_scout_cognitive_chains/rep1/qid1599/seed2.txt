To find the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \), I need to remember what the division symbol means in algebra.

## Step 1: Understanding Division in Algebra
In algebra, the division symbol \(\div\) can be replaced by a fraction. So, \( c \div(h+4) \) can be written as a fraction with \(c\) on top and \(h+4\) on the bottom.

## 2: Writing the Fraction
So, it would be... \( \frac{c}{h+4} \) wait, that looks right. Is that...?

## 3: Checking Other Options
Let me quickly glance at the other options to make sure. There's B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \), C: \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \), and D: \( \frac{h+4}{c} \). B adds a \(+4\) to the \(c\), which doesn't seem right. C seems to have done something with the \(+4\) that doesn't look correct. And D flips the \(c\) and \(h+4\), which is definitely wrong.

## 4: Finalizing
Okay, so \( c \div(h+4) \) definitely means \(c\) divided by \(h+4\), which is... A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \).

The final answer is A.
