To work out which answer shows the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div (h + 4) \), I'll go through each option...

## Step 1: Understanding the Calculation
The calculation given is \( c \div (h + 4) \). This means we are dividing \( c \) by the sum of \( h \) and \( 4 \).

## 2: Writing the Calculation
In algebra, division is often shown as a fraction. So, \( c \div (h + 4) \) can be written as \( \frac{c}{h + 4} \).

## 3: Comparing with Options
Let's look at the options:
- A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)
- B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \) (this looks like \( (c + 4) \div (h + 4) \), not what we want)
- C: \( \frac{c}{h} + 4 \) (this looks like \( (c \div h) + 4 \), not what we want either)
- D: \( \frac{h+4}{c} \) (this is \( (h + 4) \div c \), which is the inverse of what we need)

## 4: Selecting the Correct Option
From my understanding, option A directly matches how I initially wrote the calculation: \( \frac{c}{h + 4} \). It seems like the correct answer because it directly represents \( c \) divided by \( (h + 4) \) without doing anything else.

## 5: Final Check
Just to make sure... if I do \( c \div (h + 4) \), it indeed means \( c \) over \( h + 4 \), which is...

The answer is A.
