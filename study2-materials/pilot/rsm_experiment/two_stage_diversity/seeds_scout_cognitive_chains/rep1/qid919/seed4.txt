## Step 1: Understand the equation given
The equation given is $y = 3x^{2}$. I need to find the value of $y$ when $x = 0.3$.

## Step 2: Substitute $x = 0.3$ into the equation
To find $y$, I substitute $x = 0.3$ into the equation: $y = 3 \times (0.3)^{2}$.

## 3: Calculate $(0.3)^{2}$
First, I calculate $(0.3)^{2}$. So, $(0.3)^{2} = 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$.

## 4: Calculate $y$
Now, I multiply by 3: $y = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

## 5: Check the answer choices
I look at the answer choices: A) $0.81$, B) $0.27$, C) $1.8$, D) $2.7$. My calculation matches option B.

The best answer is B.
