## Step 1: Understand the equation given
The equation given is \(y = 3x^2\). This means that to find \(y\), we need to square \(x\) and then multiply by 3.

## 2: Identify the value of \(x\)
The value of \(x\) given in the table is \(0.3\).

## 3: Calculate \(x^2\)
To find \(x^2\), we square \(0.3\). So, \(0.3^2 = 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09\).

## 4: Calculate \(y\)
Now, we multiply \(x^2\) by 3 to find \(y\). So, \(y = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\).

## 5: Check the calculation
Let me check if I did that right... \(0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09\) and \(3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\). Yeah, that looks right.

## 6: Choose the answer
Given my calculation, the answer should be \(0.27\), which corresponds to option B.

The best answer is B.
