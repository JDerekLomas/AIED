## Step 1: Understand the equation given
The equation given is \(y = 3x^{2}\). This means we need to square the value of \(x\) and then multiply by 3 to find \(y\).

## 2: Identify the value of \(x\)
The value of \(x\) given in the table is \(0.3\).

## 3: Calculate \(y\) using the given \(x\)
To find \(y\), we substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation \(y = 3x^{2}\).
So, \(y = 3 \times (0.3)^{2}\).

## 4: Square \(0.3\)
\((0.3)^{2} = 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09\).

## 5: Multiply by 3
Now, multiply \(0.09\) by 3: \(3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\).

## 6: Check the calculations
Let me check if I did that right... \(0.3^{2} = 0.09\), and \(3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\). Yeah, that looks right.

## 7: Choose the answer
So, the answer should be \(0.27\), which corresponds to option B.

The best answer is B.
