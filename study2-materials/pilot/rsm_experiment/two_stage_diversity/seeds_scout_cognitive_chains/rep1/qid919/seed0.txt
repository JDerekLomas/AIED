## Step 1: Understand the equation given
The equation given is \(y = 3x^{2}\). I need to find \(y\) when \(x = 0.3\).

## 2: Substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation
To find \(y\), I substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation: \(y = 3 \times (0.3)^{2}\).

## 3: Calculate \(0.3^{2}\)
First, I calculate \(0.3^{2}\). So, \(0.3^{2} = 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09\).

## 4: Multiply by 3
Now, I multiply \(0.09\) by \(3\): \(3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\).

## 5: Check my work
Let me check my work... \(0.3^{2} = 0.09\), and \(3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\). Yeah, that looks right.

## 6: Choose the answer
So, the answer is... B) \(0.27\).

The best answer is B.
