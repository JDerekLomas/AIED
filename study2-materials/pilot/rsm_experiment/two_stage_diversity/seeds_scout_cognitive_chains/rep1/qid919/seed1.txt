## Step 1: Understand the equation given
The equation given is \(y = 3x^{2}\). I need to find \(y\) when \(x = 0.3\).

## Step 2: Substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation
To find \(y\), I'll substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation \(y = 3x^{2}\). So, \(y = 3 \times (0.3)^{2}\).

## 3: Calculate \((0.3)^{2}\)
\((0.3)^{2} = 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09\).

## 4: Calculate \(y\)
Now, I'll multiply by 3: \(y = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\).

## 5: Check my work
Let me check if I did that right... \(0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09\), that's correct. And \(3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\), yeah, that's right.

## 6: Choose the answer
So, the answer is B) \(0.27\).

The best answer is B.
