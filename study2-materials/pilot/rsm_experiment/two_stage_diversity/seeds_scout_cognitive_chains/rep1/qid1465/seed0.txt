## Step 1: First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is BIDMAS/BODMAS: Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.
I think I remember that... so I need to do the multiplication first. The equation is \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). 

## 2: Do the multiplication part.
\(4 \times 2 = 8\), I'm pretty sure.

## 3: Now, substitute the result of the multiplication back into the equation.
So, it becomes \(3 - 5 + 8\).

## 4: Next, I do the addition and subtraction from left to right.
First, \(3 - 5...\) um... that's \(-2\), I think.

## 5: Now, I add 8 to -2.
\(-2 + 8 = 6\), yeah, that's right.

## 6: Choose the correct answer based on my calculation.
My calculation is \(6\), so the answer must be... A) \(6\).

The best answer is A.
