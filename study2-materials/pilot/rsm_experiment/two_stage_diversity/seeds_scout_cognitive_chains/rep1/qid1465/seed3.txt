## Step 1: Identify the operations and the order
First, we need to do the multiplication, then the addition and subtraction. So, we have \(4 \times 2\) to do first.

## Step 2: Calculate the multiplication
\(4 \times 2 = 8\). So now, the equation looks like \(3 - 5 + 8\).

## 3: Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right
Now, I'll do \(3 - 5\). That's \(-2\). So, it looks like \(-2 + 8\).

## 4: Final calculation
\(-2 + 8 = 6\). I'm pretty sure that's right...

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
