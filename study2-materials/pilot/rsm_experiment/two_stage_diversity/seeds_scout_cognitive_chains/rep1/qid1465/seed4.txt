## Step 1: First, I need to work out the multiplication part of the equation.
The equation is \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). I think I should do the multiplication first... so \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

## Step 2: Now, I'll substitute the multiplication result back into the equation.
So, it becomes \(3 - 5 + 8\).

## 3: Next, I'll do the addition and subtraction parts from left to right.
First, \(3 - 5 = -2\). 

## 4: Then, I'll add 8 to -2.
\(-2 + 8 = 6\).

## 5: Choose the correct answer based on my calculation.
My calculation shows the answer equals \(6\), so I think the correct answer is... A) \(6\).

The best answer is A.
