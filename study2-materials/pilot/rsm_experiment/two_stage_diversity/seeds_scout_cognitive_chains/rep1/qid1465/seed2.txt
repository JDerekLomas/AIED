## Step 1: Write down the expression
The expression given is \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\).

## Step 2: Multiply 4 and 2
First, I need to do the multiplication. So, \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

## Step 3: Rewrite the expression with the multiplication result
Now the expression becomes \(3 - 5 + 8\).

## 4: Subtract 5 from 3
\(3 - 5 = -2\).

## 5: Add 8 to -2
\(-2 + 8 = 6\).

## 6: Choose the correct answer
Looking at the options: A) \(6\), B) \(4\), C) \(-12\), D) \(-10\). My answer matches option A.

The best answer is A.
