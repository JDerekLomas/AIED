## Step 1: First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is BODMAS/BPEMDAS - Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.
The expression given is \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). I don't see any brackets or orders (like squaring or square roots), so I move to multiplication.

## 2: Calculate the multiplication part of the expression.
The multiplication part is \(4 \times 2\). This equals \(8\).

## 3: Substitute the multiplication result back into the expression.
So now, the expression looks like \(3 - 5 + 8\).

## 4: Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.
First, \(3 - 5\). This equals \(-2\).

## 5: Continue with the addition and subtraction.
Now, I have \(-2 + 8\). This equals \(6\).

## 6: Choose the correct answer based on my calculation.
My calculation shows the answer is \(6\), which corresponds to option A.

The best answer is A.
