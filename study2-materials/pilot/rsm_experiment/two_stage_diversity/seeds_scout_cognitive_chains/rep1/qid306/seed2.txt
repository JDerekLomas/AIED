## Step 1: Understand the problems
I have two problems to solve: Problem P is \( 4-5+6 \) and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6 \).

## 2: Determine the order of operations for Problem P
For Problem P, \( 4-5+6 \), I think I should just do the operations from left to right because I don't see any multiplication or division. So, first, I do \( 4-5 \) because it's the first thing from the left.

## 3: Determine the order of operations for Problem Q
For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6 \), I remember learning about BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction) in class. So, for Problem Q, I should do the multiplication first, which means I do \( 5 \times 6 \) before adding.

## 4: Choose the correct option
Based on my understanding:
- For Problem P, I do \( 4-5 \) first.
- For Problem Q, I do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 5: Match my choice to the given options
My choice matches option B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \).

The best answer is B.
