To solve this, I need to remember the order of operations... um... BODMAS? Yeah, that's it. BODMAS. Brackets, Of, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. For Problem P, it's just addition and subtraction, so I do it from left to right, I think.

## Step 1: Determine the operations in Problem P
In Problem P, \( 4-5+6 \), I have subtraction and addition. Since it's from left to right for the same... uh... level or something, I do \( 4-5 \) first.

## 2: Determine the operations in Problem Q
In Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6 \), I have multiplication and addition. According to BODMAS, I do the multiplication first. So, I do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 3: Match my decisions to the answer choices
- For Problem P, I decided to do \( 4-5 \) first.
- For Problem Q, I decided to do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 4: Choose the correct answer
Given my decisions:
- Problem P: \( 4-5 \)
- Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \)

I see that option B matches my decisions: 
Problem P: \( 4-5 \)
Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \)

The best answer is B.
