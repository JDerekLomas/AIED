## Step 1: Understand the problems
I have two problems to solve: \( 4-5+6= \) and \( 4+5 \times 6= \). I need to figure out which calculation I should do first for each problem.

## 2: Analyze Problem P
For Problem P, \( 4-5+6= \), I think I should do the operations from left to right. So, first, I should do \( 4-5 \) because they are next to each other.

## 3: Analyze Problem Q
For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6= \), I'm pretty sure we do multiplication before addition. So, I should do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 4: Write down my thoughts
For Problem P, the first thing to do is \( 4-5 \). For Problem Q, the first thing to do is \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 5: Match my thoughts to the options
Let's see... I think Problem P should start with \( 4-5 \) and Problem Q should start with \( 5 \times 6 \). That's option B.

## 6: Confirm my choice
I'm going to choose B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \).

The best answer is B.
