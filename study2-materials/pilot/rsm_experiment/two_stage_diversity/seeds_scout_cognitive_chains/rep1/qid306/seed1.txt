## Step 1: Understand the problems
I have two problems to solve: Problem P is \( 4-5+6 \) and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6 \).

## Step 2: Determine the order of operations for Problem P
For Problem P, \( 4-5+6 \), I think I should just do the operations from left to right since they are all addition and subtraction. So, first, I do \( 4-5 \).

## 3: Determine the order of operations for Problem Q
For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6 \), I'm pretty sure we do multiplication before addition, so first, I need to do \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 4: Match my decisions to the answer choices
From my thinking, for Problem P, I should do \( 4-5 \) first, and for Problem Q, I should do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 5: Choose the correct answer
Looking at the options:
- A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - No, that's not right for Problem Q.
- B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Yes, that matches what I thought.
- C: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - No, that's not right for either.
- D: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - No, that's not right for Problem P.

The best answer is B.
