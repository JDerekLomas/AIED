## Step 1: Read the problems
I need to solve two problems: \( 4-5+6= \) and \( 4+5 \times 6= \).

## 2: Identify the operations in each problem
For Problem P: \( 4-5+6= \), I see subtraction and addition. For Problem Q: \( 4+5 \times 6= \), I see addition and multiplication.

## 3: Recall the order of operations
My teacher told me about BIDMAS/BODMAS: Brackets, Indices (or Orders), Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. But I'm not sure if it applies to both problems.

## 4: Apply the order of operations to Problem P
In Problem P, \( 4-5+6= \), I don't see any brackets, indices, division, or multiplication, so I just have addition and subtraction. I'm going to do the operations from left to right. So, first, I do \( 4-5 \), because it's the first one I come across.

## 5: Apply the order of operations to Problem Q
For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6= \), I use BODMAS. Multiplication comes before addition, so I do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 6: Choose the correct option
For Problem P, I do \( 4-5 \) first. For Problem Q, I do \( 5 \times 6 \) first. Looking at the options:
- A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - No, because for Q, I should do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.
- B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Yeah, that's what I thought.
- C and D are not what I thought.

## 7: Confirm the choice
Yes, I'm sure. Problem P, I do \( 4-5 \) first and Problem Q, I do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

The best answer is B.
