## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply out the brackets for the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). I think we're supposed to use the FOIL method or something like that. FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last.

## 2: Apply the FOIL method
Let's start with the FOIL method. First, I multiply the first terms in each bracket: \(m \times m = m^2\).

## 3: Continue with FOIL - Outer terms
Next, I multiply the outer terms: \(m \times -7 = -7m\).

## 4: Continue with FOIL - Inner terms
Then, I multiply the inner terms: \(-5 \times m = -5m\).

## 5: Continue with FOIL - Last terms
After that, I multiply the last terms in each bracket: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\).

## 6: Combine the terms
Now, I add all these terms together: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\). I can simplify this by combining like terms: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 7: Review the work
Let me check my work... \(m^2\) is definitely right. Then \(-7m - 5m = -12m\), that's okay. And \(-5 \times -7 = 35\), positive 35. Yeah, I think that's right.

## 8: Choose the answer
Based on my calculation, \(m^2 - 12m + 35\), I think the correct answer is... B.

The best answer is B.
