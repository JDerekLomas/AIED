## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem asks me to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\).

## Step 2: Recall the method for multiplying out brackets
To multiply out brackets, I need to multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket. So, it should be \(m \times m\), \(m \times -7\), \(-5 \times m\), and \(-5 \times -7\).

## 3: Perform the multiplication
\(m \times m = m^2\),
\(m \times -7 = -7m\),
\(-5 \times m = -5m\),
\(-5 \times -7 = 35\).

## 4: Combine like terms
Now, I add these together: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\).

## 5: Simplify by combining like terms
Combining the \(m\) terms: \(-7m - 5m = -12m\), so I get \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 6: Write down the final expression
The expression simplifies to \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 7: Choose the correct answer
Looking at the options:
A) \(m^{2}-2 m-35\),
B) \(m^{2}-12 m+35\),
C) \(m^{2}+12 m+35\),
D) \(m^{2}-12 m-35\),
my answer matches option B.

The best answer is B.
