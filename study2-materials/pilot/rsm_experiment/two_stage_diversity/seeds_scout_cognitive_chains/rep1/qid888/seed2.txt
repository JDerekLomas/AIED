## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). I think I've done this before, but I'm not really sure.

## 2: Apply the multiplication
To multiply out the brackets, I need to multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket. So, it will be \(m \times m\), \(m \times -7\), \(-5 \times m\), and \(-5 \times -7\).

## 3: Perform the multiplication
\(m \times m = m^2\),
\(m \times -7 = -7m\),
\(-5 \times m = -5m\),
\(-5 \times -7 = 35\).

## 4: Combine like terms
Now, I add them all together: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\).

## 5: Simplify
Combine the \(m\) terms: \(-7m - 5m = -12m\). So, it simplifies to \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 6: Check the answer
Let me check if I've done it right. I'm pretty sure that's how you do it. \(m^2 - 12m + 35\) looks right to me.

## 7: Choose the answer
Comparing my answer to the options:
A: \(m^{2}-2 m-35\),
B: \(m^{2}-12 m+35\),
C: \(m^{2}+12 m+35\),
D: \(m^{2}-12 m-35\),
my answer matches option B.

The best answer is B.
