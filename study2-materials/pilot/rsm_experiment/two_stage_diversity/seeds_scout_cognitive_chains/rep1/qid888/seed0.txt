## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). I'm not really sure how to do this, but I think we're supposed to use the FOIL method or something.

## 2: Apply the FOIL method
The FOIL method stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. So, I multiply the first terms in each bracket, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, and finally the last terms in each bracket.

## 3: Calculate each part
- First: \(m \times m = m^2\)
- Outer: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
- Inner: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
- Last: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)

## 4: Combine the terms
Now, I add these together: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\). I think I can simplify this by combining the \(-7m\) and \(-5m\).

## 5: Simplify
Combining \(-7m\) and \(-5m\) gives \(-12m\), so I have: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 6: Check my work
Let me just check that I haven't made any mistakes... I don't see any, but I'm not really sure. This looks right, though.

## 7: Choose the answer
Based on my working, the answer is: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\), which is B.

The best answer is B.
