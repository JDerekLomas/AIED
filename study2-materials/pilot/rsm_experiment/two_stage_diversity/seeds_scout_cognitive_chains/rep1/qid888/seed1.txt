## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). I'm not really sure how to do this, but I think it involves multiplying each term inside the brackets by each term in the other brackets.

## 2: Apply the method
Okay, so I multiply \(m\) by \(m\) to get \(m^2\), then \(m\) by \(-7\) to get \(-7m\), then \(-5\) by \(m\) to get \(-5m\), and finally \(-5\) by \(-7\) to get \(35\). So, it looks like: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\).

## 3: Simplify the expression
Now, I combine like terms: \(-7m - 5m = -12m\), so the expression simplifies to \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 4: Check the work
Wait, did I do that right? Let me check... Multiplying out brackets, it's like a FOIL method or something, right? First, Outer, Inner, Last. So, \(m \times m = m^2\), \(m \times -7 = -7m\), \(-5 \times m = -5m\), and \(-5 \times -7 = 35\). Yeah, that looks right: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 5: Choose the answer
That's definitely \(m^2 - 12m + 35\). So, the answer must be... B.

The best answer is B.
