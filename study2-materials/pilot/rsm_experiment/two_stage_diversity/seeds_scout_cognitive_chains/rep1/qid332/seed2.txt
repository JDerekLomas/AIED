## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the task
The equation given is \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \). We need to determine if Tom or Katie's suggested next line of working is correct.

## 2: Analyze Tom's suggestion
Tom says a correct next line of working could be \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). To check this, I'll add 5 to both sides of the original equation:
\( \frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5 \)
This simplifies to:
\( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \)
So, Tom's suggestion seems correct.

## 3: Analyze Katie's suggestion
Katie says a correct next line of working could be \( x - 5 = 36 \). To check this, I'll first multiply both sides of the original equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
\( \frac{x}{3} \times 3 - 5 \times 3 = 12 \times 3 \)
This simplifies to:
\( x - 15 = 36 \)
Not \( x - 5 = 36 \), so Katie's suggestion seems incorrect.

## 4: Conclusion
From my analysis, Tom's suggestion is correct because adding 5 to both sides of the equation \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) indeed yields \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). Katie's suggestion does not match the correct manipulation of the equation.

## 5: Choose the correct answer
Given that Tom is correct and Katie is not, the correct answer is:

The best answer is A.
