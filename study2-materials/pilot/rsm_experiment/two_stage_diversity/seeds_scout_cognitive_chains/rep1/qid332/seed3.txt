## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \).

## Step 2: Consider Tom's suggestion
Tom says a correct next line of working could be \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). To check if this is correct, I'll add 5 to both sides of the equation.
\( \frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5 \)
This simplifies to:
\( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \)
So, Tom seems correct.

## 3: Consider Katie's suggestion
Katie says a correct next line of working could be \( x - 5 = 36 \). To check if this is correct, I'll multiply both sides of the original equation by 3 to see if it matches Katie's line.
\( \frac{x}{3} \times 3 - 5 \times 3 = 12 \times 3 \)
This gives:
\( x - 15 = 36 \)
Not \( x - 5 = 36 \), so Katie's suggestion seems wrong.

## 4: Double-check Katie's suggestion
Wait, let me recheck Katie's step properly...
If \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \), then multiplying everything by 3:
\( x - 15 = 36 \)
Adding 15 to both sides to solve for x:
\( x = 51 \)
But Katie said \( x - 5 = 36 \), which implies \( x = 41 \). This doesn't match our derivation, confirming Katie's suggestion is incorrect.

## 5: Conclusion
From my steps, Tom's suggestion seems right because adding 5 to both sides of the equation \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) indeed gives \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). Katie's suggestion doesn't seem to follow correctly from the original equation.

## 6: Final evaluation
Since Tom is correct and Katie is not, the correct answer must reflect this.

The best answer is A.
