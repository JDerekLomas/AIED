## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the statements from Tom and Katie.
The equation given is \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \). Tom says a correct next line of working could be \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \), and Katie says a correct next line of working could be \( x - 5 = 36 \).

## 2: Evaluate Tom's statement.
To check Tom's statement, I'll add 5 to both sides of the original equation: \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5 \), which simplifies to \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). This matches Tom's statement, so Tom is correct.

## 3: Evaluate Katie's statement.
For Katie's statement, \( x - 5 = 36 \), I'll check if it aligns with the original equation. First, multiply both sides of the original equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction: \( x - 15 = 36 \). This doesn't match Katie's statement directly, but let's properly derive it from the original equation. If we multiply every term by 3, we get \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \). So, Katie's statement seems incorrect based on this.

## 4: Double-check Katie's statement with proper algebra.
Let's properly check Katie's claim. If Katie's line is \( x - 5 = 36 \), then solving for \( x \) gives \( x = 41 \). Let's see if this \( x \) satisfies the original equation: \( \frac{41}{3} - 5 = 13.67 - 5 = 8.67 \), which does not equal 12. This confirms Katie's statement is incorrect.

## 5: Conclusion.
Since Tom's statement is correct and Katie's is not, the correct answer is that only Tom is correct.

The best answer is A.
