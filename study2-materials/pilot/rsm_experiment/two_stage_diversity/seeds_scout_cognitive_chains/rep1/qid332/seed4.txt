## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the task
The equation given is \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\). The task is to determine if Tom or Katie's suggested next line of working is correct. Tom suggests \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), and Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\).

## 2: Analyze Tom's suggestion
To check Tom's suggestion, I will add 5 to both sides of the original equation. So, \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5\), which simplifies to \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This seems to be a correct step as it follows the basic rule of solving equations by isolating the variable.

## 3: Analyze Katie's suggestion
For Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), let's see if it's correct. If we multiply both sides of the original equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction, we get \(x - 15 = 36\). This does not match Katie's suggestion of \(x - 5 = 36\), so it seems Katie might have made a mistake or her method is incorrect.

## 4: Detailed check of Katie's method
Multiplying the entire original equation by 3: \(3 \times (\frac{x}{3} - 5) = 3 \times 12\), which gives \(x - 15 = 36\). Adding 15 to both sides gives \(x = 51\). Let's check if Katie's step could logically lead to a correct solution: if \(x - 5 = 36\), then \(x = 41\), which does not seem right based on my previous calculation.

## 5: Determine the correctness of each suggestion
Tom's suggestion, \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), directly derives from adding 5 to both sides of the equation, which is a valid algebraic step. Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), does not directly derive from a simple, correct algebraic manipulation of the original equation. To get \(x - 5 = 36\), you would have had to multiply by 3 and then end up with a different equation.

## 6: Conclusion
Given that Tom's suggestion is clearly correct and follows standard algebraic manipulation, and Katie's suggestion does not directly follow from the original equation in a straightforward manner, it seems Tom is correct.

## 7: Final evaluation
Tom is correct because \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) leads to \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\) by adding 5 to both sides. Katie's \(x - 5 = 36\) would actually imply \(x = 41\), but let's verify Tom's result: if \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), then \(x = 51\). Plugging \(x = 51\) into the original equation: \(\frac{51}{3} - 5 = 17 - 5 = 12\), which checks out.

The best answer is A.
