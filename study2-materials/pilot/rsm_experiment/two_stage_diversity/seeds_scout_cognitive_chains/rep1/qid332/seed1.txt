## Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to solve the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) and check if Tom or Katie's suggested next line of working is correct.

## 2: Try to solve the equation to verify their steps
First, let's try to solve it by following Tom's step. Tom says \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). To get to this line, we would add 5 to both sides of the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\).

## 3: Verify Tom's step
If we add 5 to both sides:
\(\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5\)
This simplifies to:
\(\frac{x}{3} = 17\)
So, Tom seems correct.

## 4: Verify Katie's step
Katie says \(x - 5 = 36\). To check this, let's see what happens if we multiply both sides of the original equation by 3:
\(x - 15 = 36\)
Wait, that doesn't match Katie's step. Let's try to derive her step properly:
If we multiply the entire original equation by 3:
\(x - 15 = 36\)
But Katie said \(x - 5 = 36\), which doesn't seem right based on our derivation.

## 5: Detailed check of Katie's step
Let's properly derive Katie's suggested step:
Original equation: \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\)
Multiplying every term by 3 to clear the fraction:
\(x - 15 = 36\)
Not \(x - 5 = 36\), which means Katie's suggestion seems incorrect based on this.

## 6: Conclusion
Tom's step seems correct because adding 5 to both sides of the original equation indeed yields \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\).
Katie's step doesn't seem correct because if you multiply the whole equation by 3, you get \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\).

## 7: Final assessment
Given that Tom's suggestion directly follows from adding 5 to both sides of the equation and Katie's doesn't match the proper manipulation of the equation, it appears Tom is correct and Katie is not.

## 8: Choosing the answer
So, only Tom is correct.

The best answer is A.
