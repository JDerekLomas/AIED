## Step 1: Understand what the mean is
The mean is like the average, right? So, to find it, I need to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are.

## Step 2: Add up all the numbers
The numbers are 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. Let me add them up...
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 3 = 4
4 + 4 = 8
8 + 7 = 15

## 3: Count how many numbers there are
There are... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 numbers. So, 5 numbers.

## 4: Calculate the mean
To find the mean, I divide the total sum by the number of numbers. So, it's 15 ÷ 5 = 3.

## 5: Look at the options
Now, let me see if any of the options match what I did...
- A: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) This is missing the 0, but let's see... 1+3+4+7 = 15, and 15 ÷ 5 = 3. But wait, they missed the 0.
- B: \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \) This looks weird because of the ÷ 5 at the end. It should be \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \) for it to make sense, but as it is, it looks like it would do 7 ÷ 5 first...
- C: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \) This one's missing the 0 and also divides by 4 instead of 5.

## 6: Analyze option A more closely
Option A: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). If I add 1+3+4+7, I get 15. And 15 ÷ 5 = 3, which matches my answer. But I feel like I should include the 0...

## 7: Try including 0 in option A
If I include the 0, it should be \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \). So, 0+1+3+4+7 = 15. And 15 ÷ 5 = 3. This seems right.

## 8: Compare with given options
- A: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) actually equals \( \frac{15}{5} \) which is 3, but it doesn't include the 0.
- B: \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \) is not correct because it implies 7 ÷ 5 first.
- C: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \) is wrong because it doesn't include 0 and divides by 4.

## 9: Conclusion
The only one that actually calculates the mean correctly as I understand it is not listed perfectly because A misses the 0. However, calculating with the 0 included: \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \) which is what I really need, but that's not an option directly. A gives the right answer but for the wrong reason (missing 0).

The best answer is D.
