To find the mean, we need to add up all the numbers and then divide by... um... the number of numbers, right?

So, the numbers are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7

First, let's add them up: 
\(0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = \) 

I'm going to do it step by step... 
\(0 + 1 = 1\)
\(1 + 3 = 4\)
\(4 + 4 = 8\)
\(8 + 7 = 15\)

So, the total is 15. 

Now, we need to divide by... there are 5 numbers, I think. Yeah, I'm pretty sure. 

So, we divide by 5: \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \)

But, let's look at the options:

A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) 

If we calculate the numerator... \(1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15\), just like we did. And then it's divided by 5, which looks right.

B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \)

Wait, that doesn't look right. The 0 is missing from the numerator, and the division by 5 is in the wrong place. That's going to give a weird answer.

C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \)

That's dividing by 4, not 5. So, that's wrong.

D) None of them

I'm going to check A properly... 
\(1+3+4+7 = 15\), and \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \). That's the right answer.

Option A seems right. I'm going to go with A.

The final answer is A.
