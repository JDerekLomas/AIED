To find the mean, we need to add up all the numbers and then divide by... um... how many numbers there are, right?

So, let's add them up: \(0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7\)

\(0 + 1 = 1\)

\(1 + 3 = 4\)

\(4 + 4 = 8\)

\(8 + 7 = 15\)

So, the total is \(15\). And there are... \(5\) numbers.

So, we need to divide \(15\) by \(5\), which is \(3\).

Now, let's look at the options:

A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \)

If we calculate the top bit: \(1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15\)

But wait, they didn't add the \(0\). Is that right? Don't we need to add the \(0\)? *crosses out \(A\)*

B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \)

This one looks a bit dodgy because of the division by \(5\) just at the end. I think that's wrong because it looks like it will just divide the \(7\) by \(5\), not the total by \(5\). *crosses out \(B\)*

C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \)

This one is missing the \(0\) again and also says divide by \(4\), not \(5\). So that's wrong.

D) None of them

I'm not sure... I think A is close but it's missing the \(0\). If we change it to: \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \) then that would be right.

But the question is, which one *as it is* will give the correct answer?

Let's re-check A: if we add \(0+1+3+4+7\) it equals \(15\), and \(15 \div 5 = 3\). So, it's actually... 

## Step 1: Calculate the sum of the given numbers including 0.
The sum is \(0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15\).

## 2: Determine how many numbers there are.
There are \(5\) numbers.

## 3: Calculate the mean.
The mean is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

## 4: Evaluate option A with the correct calculation.
Option A without the \(0\) is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

## 5: Realize that option A actually works despite initial doubts.
Even though I thought it was missing the \(0\), it actually still works because \(1+3+4+7 = 15\).

The best answer is A.
