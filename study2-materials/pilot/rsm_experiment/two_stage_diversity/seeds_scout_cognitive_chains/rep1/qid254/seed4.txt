To find the mean, we need to add up all the numbers and then... uh... divide by something. I'm pretty sure that's right.

First, let's add up all the numbers:
\[ 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = \]

Starting to add them up...
\[ 0 + 1 = 1 \]
\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]
\[ 8 + 7 = 15 \]

So, the total is 15.

Now, to find the mean, we need to divide by... hmm... how many numbers are there? *counts* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There are 5 numbers.

So, we divide by 5. That means the correct calculation should be:
\[ \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \]

But wait, that's not an option. The closest one I see is:
A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \)

But, hang on, they're missing the 0. Does that matter? If we leave out the 0, it changes the total. I'm pretty sure we need to include the 0.

Let's check the other options:

B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \)

Using BIDMAS, we do the division before the addition, so that's:
\[ 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + (7 \div 5) \]
\[ 7 \div 5 = 1.4 \]
So that would be:
\[ 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1.4 = 9.4 \]

That can't be right. And what's this:
C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \)

They're dividing by 4, not 5, and also missing the 0. That looks wrong.

D) None of them

I'm not sure I trust A) because it doesn't have the 0.

But, actually... if I redo A) with the 0 included:
\[ \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} = \frac{15}{5} \]

That's actually correct. The 0 doesn't change the total we already calculated. So... 

The Answer: A
