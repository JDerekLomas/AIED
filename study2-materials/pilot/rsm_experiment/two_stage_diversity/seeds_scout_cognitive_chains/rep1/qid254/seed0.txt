To find the mean, we need to add up all the numbers and then divide by... um... the number of numbers, right?

So, the numbers are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7

First, let's add them up: 
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 3 = 4
4 + 4 = 8
8 + 7 = 15

So, the total is 15. And there are... 5 numbers.

Now, to find the mean, we divide 15 by 5... which equals 3.

Let's look at the options:

A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \)

If we do the calculation inside the brackets: 
1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15

So, it's \( \frac{15}{5} \), which is 3. That looks right.

B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \)

Wait, is that right? I think that's wrong because of the order of operations... we need to do the division before the addition, don't we? No, that's not right... 

\( 0+1+3+4+7 = 15 \), and then you divide by 5... but it looks wrong because of the way it's written. If I do it step by step: 
0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15, then 15 ÷ 5 = 3. But that's not what it says... it says add and then divide the 7 by 5... 

\( 7 \div 5 = 1.4 \) and then \( 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1.4 = 9.4 \) No, that's definitely wrong.

C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \)

There are 5 numbers, not 4... so that's wrong.

D) None of them

But A looks right...

The final answer is A.
