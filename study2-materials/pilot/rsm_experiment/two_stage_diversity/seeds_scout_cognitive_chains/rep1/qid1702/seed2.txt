## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \(10x - 6y = 30\).

## Step 2: Identify the given values
We are given \(y = 0.5\) and we need to find \(x\).

## 3: Substitute \(y\) into the equation
Substituting \(y = 0.5\) into the equation gives \(10x - 6(0.5) = 30\).

## 4: Perform the multiplication
\(10x - 3 = 30\).

## 5: Add 3 to both sides
\(10x = 30 + 3\), which simplifies to \(10x = 33\).

## 6: Solve for \(x\)
Divide both sides by 10: \(x = \frac{33}{10}\).

## 7: Calculate \(x\)
\(x = 3.3\).

## 8: Choose the correct answer
From the calculations, \(x = 3.3\), so the answer should be \(3.3\).

The best answer is C.
