## Step 1: Write down the equation
The equation given is $10x - 6y = 30$.

## Step 2: Identify given values
We are given $y = 0.5$ and we need to find $x$.

## 3: Substitute $y$ into the equation
Substituting $y = 0.5$ into the equation gives $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$.

## 4: Solve for $x$
Now, solve for $x$: $10x - 3 = 30$.

## 5: Add 3 to both sides
Adding 3 to both sides gives $10x = 33$.

## 6: Divide by 10
Dividing both sides by 10 gives $x = 3.3$.

## 7: Choose the answer
So, the value that should replace the star is $3.3$. Let's look at the options: A) $4.25$, B) $-4.25$, C) $3.3$, D) $2.7$. I think I got it right...

The best answer is C.
