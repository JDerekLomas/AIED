## Step 1: Write down the given equation and the table of values.
The equation given is $10x - 6y = 30$. The table of values has $y = 0.5$ and $x$ is missing, represented by $\bigstar$.

## 2: Substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation to find $x$.
Substituting $y = 0.5$ into the equation gives $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$.

## 3: Solve for $x$.
$10x - 3 = 30$ because $6 \times 0.5 = 3$.

## 4: Add 3 to both sides to isolate terms with $x$ on one side.
$10x = 30 + 3$ which simplifies to $10x = 33$.

## 5: Divide both sides by 10 to solve for $x$.
$x = \frac{33}{10}$.

## 6: Calculate the value of $x$.
$x = 3.3$.

## 7: Choose the correct answer based on the calculation.
From the calculations, $x = 3.3$, so the correct answer is C) $3.3$.

The best answer is C.
