## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem asks me to add two mixed numbers: \( 2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5} \). I need to leave my answer as a mixed number.

## 2: Add the whole numbers
First, I'll add the whole numbers: \( 2 + 1 = 3 \).

## 3: Add the fractions
Next, I'll add the fractions: \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} \). The denominators are the same, so I just add the numerators: \( 1 + 2 = 3 \), so \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5} \).

## 4: Combine the whole number and fraction
Now, I combine the whole number part and the fraction part: \( 3 + \frac{3}{5} = 3 \frac{3}{5} \).

## 5: Check my work
Let me check my work... yeah, it looks right. I'm pretty sure.

## 6: Choose my answer
Based on my calculation, \( 2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5} = 3 \frac{3}{5} \), so my answer is A.

The best answer is A.
