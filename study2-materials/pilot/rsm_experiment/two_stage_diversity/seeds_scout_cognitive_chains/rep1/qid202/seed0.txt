## Step 1: Convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions
First, I need to convert \(2 \frac{1}{5}\) and \(1 \frac{2}{5}\) into improper fractions. For \(2 \frac{1}{5}\), I do \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\), so \(2 \frac{1}{5} = \frac{11}{5}\). For \(1 \frac{2}{5}\), I do \(1 \times 5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7\), so \(1 \frac{2}{5} = \frac{7}{5}\).

## 2: Add the improper fractions
Now, I add \(\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5}\). Since the denominators are the same, I just add the numerators: \(11 + 7 = 18\). So, \(\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}\).

## 3: Convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number
To convert \(\frac{18}{5}\) back into a mixed number, I divide 18 by 5. 5 goes into 18 three times with a remainder of 3, because \(5 \times 3 = 15\) and \(18 - 15 = 3\). So, \(\frac{18}{5} = 3 \frac{3}{5}\).

## 4: Check the answer choices
Now, I look at the answer choices to see if any match \(3 \frac{3}{5}\). There's an A that says \(3 \frac{3}{5}\), which matches my answer.

The best answer is A.
