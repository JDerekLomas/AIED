Here's my working...

\( T = k^4 \)

So, if \( k = -3 \)...

\( T = (-3)^4 \)

 Um... I think I need to do the power first... or is it the negative? Wait, I'm sure it's the power... 

\( T = -3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3 \)

 Crossing out previous line... that was wrong.

\( T = (-3)^2 = 9 \)

So...

\( T = 9^2 \)

\( T = 81 \)

 Wait a minute... is that right?

Checking... 

\( (-3) \times (-3) = 9 \)

 \( 9 \times (-3) = -27 \)

\( -27 \times (-3) = 81 \)

Ah! Yeah, I'm sure it's right now.

The answer is: A) \( 81 \)
