ok so the equation is \( T=k^{4} \) and we need to find \( T \) when \( k=-3 \).

First, I'll substitute \( k=-3 \) into the equation... so it becomes \( T=(-3)^{4} \).

um... when you have a negative number to an even power, it becomes positive right? I'm pretty sure that's right...

So, \( (-3)^{4} \) is the same as \( 3^{4} \) because the negative sign goes away when it's an even power.

Now, \( 3^{4} \) is \( 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \).

Let me calculate that...

\( 3 \times 3 = 9 \)

\( 9 \times 3 = 27 \)

\( 27 \times 3 = 81 \)

So, \( T=81 \).

I'm pretty sure that's right... I didn't do anything wrong, did I?

Therefore, the answer is:
A) \( 81 \)
