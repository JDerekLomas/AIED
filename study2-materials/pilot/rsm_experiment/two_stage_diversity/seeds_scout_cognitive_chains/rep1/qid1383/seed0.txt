## Step 1: Understand the equation given
The equation given is \( T = k^{4} \). This means we need to raise \( k \) to the power of 4 to find \( T \).

## 2: Substitute \( k = -3 \) into the equation
Given \( k = -3 \), we substitute it into the equation: \( T = (-3)^{4} \).

## 3: Calculate \( (-3)^{4} \)
To calculate \( (-3)^{4} \), we need to remember the rules of indices. When a negative number is raised to an even power, the result is positive. So, \( (-3)^{4} \) means \( (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \).

## 4: Perform the multiplication
Let's do the multiplication step by step:
- \( (-3) \times (-3) = 9 \) (because two negatives make a positive)
- \( 9 \times (-3) = -27 \)
- \( -27 \times (-3) = 81 \) (again, two negatives make a positive)

## 5: Write down the solution
So, \( T = 81 \).

## 6: Choose the correct answer
Looking at the options:
A: \( 81 \)
B: \( 12 \)
C: \( -81 \)
D: \( -12 \)

The correct answer seems to be A: \( 81 \).

The best answer is A.
