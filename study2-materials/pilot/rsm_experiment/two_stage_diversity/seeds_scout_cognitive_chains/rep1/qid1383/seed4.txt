## Step 1: Understand the given equation
The equation given is \( T = k^{4} \). I need to find \( T \) when \( k = -3 \).

## 2: Substitute \( k = -3 \) into the equation
So, I substitute \( k \) with \( -3 \): \( T = (-3)^{4} \).

## 3: Calculate \( (-3)^{4} \)
To calculate \( (-3)^{4} \), I need to remember the rules of indices. A negative number raised to an even power is positive. So, \( (-3)^{4} \) is the same as \( 3^{4} \) but positive because the power is even.

## 4: Calculate \( 3^{4} \)
\( 3^{4} = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \).

## 5: Perform the multiplication
Let me do the multiplication step by step:
- \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \)
- \( 9 \times 3 = 27 \)
- \( 27 \times 3 = 81 \).

## 6: Write down the answer
So, \( T = 81 \).

## 7: Choose the correct answer option
Given that \( T = 81 \), I look at the options:
A: \( 81 \)
B: \( 12 \)
C: \( -81 \)
D: \( -12 \)

The correct answer is A. 

The best answer is A.
