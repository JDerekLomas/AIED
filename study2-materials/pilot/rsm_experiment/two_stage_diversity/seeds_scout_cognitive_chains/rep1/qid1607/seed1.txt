## Step 1: Understand the given equation and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). Isaac has provided two steps to solve for \( k \):
Step \( 1: 60 = 1 + k \)
Step \( 2: 61 = k \)

## 2: Verify Isaac's steps
To verify Isaac's steps, let's solve the equation properly:
\( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \)

## 3: Multiply both sides by 4 to isolate \( 1 + k \)
Multiplying both sides by 4 gives:
\( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \)
\( 60 = 1 + k \)

## 4: Solve for \( k \)
Now, subtract 1 from both sides:
\( 60 - 1 = k \)
\( 59 = k \)

## 5: Evaluate Isaac's steps
Isaac's Step \( 1: 60 = 1 + k \) seems correct based on our calculation in Step 3.
However, his Step \( 2: 61 = k \) is incorrect because we found \( k = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 6: Determine the correctness of Isaac's steps
Since Step \( 1 \) is correct but Step \( 2 \) is incorrect, we need to choose the option that reflects this.

## 7: Choose the correct answer
Given that only Step \( 1 \) is correct and Step \( 2 \) is incorrect, the correct answer is:
A) Only step \( 1 \)

The best answer is A.
