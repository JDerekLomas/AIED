## Step 1: Understand the given equation and Isaac's steps.
The equation given is \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \). Isaac's steps are:
Step \( 1: \) \( 60=1+k \)
Step \( 2: \) \( 61=k \)

## 2: Solve the equation to verify Isaac's steps.
To solve \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \), first multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
\( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \)
\( 60 = 1 + k \)

## 3: Continue solving for \( k \).
Now, subtract 1 from both sides to solve for \( k \):
\( 60 - 1 = k \)
\( 59 = k \)

## 4: Evaluate Isaac's steps.
Isaac's Step \( 1: \) \( 60=1+k \) seems correct based on my calculation in Step 2.
However, his Step \( 2: \) \( 61=k \) is incorrect based on my calculation in Step 3, which shows \( k = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 5: Determine the correctness of Isaac's steps.
Since Step \( 1 \) is correct (\( 60=1+k \) is true) but Step \( 2 \) is incorrect (\( 61=k \) is false, it should be \( 59=k \)), we conclude that only Step \( 1 \) is correct.

## 6: Choose the correct answer based on the evaluation.
Given that only Step \( 1 \) is correct, the answer is:
A) Only step \( 1 \)

The best answer is A.
