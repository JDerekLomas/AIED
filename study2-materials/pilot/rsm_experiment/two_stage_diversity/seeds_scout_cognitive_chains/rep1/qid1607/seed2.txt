## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \).

## Step 2: Try to isolate \( k \)
To isolate \( k \), I think I need to get rid of the fraction. So, I'll multiply both sides by 4. That gives me \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \), which simplifies to \( 60 = 1 + k \).

## 3: Check Isaac's Step 1
Isaac's Step 1 says \( 60 = 1 + k \). This looks like what I just did, so I think his Step 1 is correct.

## 4: Solve for \( k \)
Now, I need to solve for \( k \). I'll subtract 1 from both sides of \( 60 = 1 + k \) to get \( k \) by itself. So, \( 60 - 1 = k \), which gives \( 59 = k \).

## 5: Check Isaac's Step 2
Isaac's Step 2 says \( 61 = k \). I got \( 59 = k \), not \( 61 = k \), so I think his Step 2 is incorrect.

## 6: Determine the correctness of Isaac's steps
Since I think Isaac's Step 1 is correct but his Step 2 is incorrect, the correct answer must reflect that only Step 1 is correct.

## 7: Choose the correct answer
Given that only Isaac's Step 1 is correct, the answer is A) Only step \( 1 \).

The best answer is A.
