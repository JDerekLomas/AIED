To check Isaac's steps, I'll go through the equation myself.

The equation is: \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \)

First, I need to get rid of the fraction. To do that, I'll multiply both sides by 4...

\( 15 \times 4 = \frac{1+k}{4} \times 4 \)

That simplifies to:

\( 60 = 1 + k \)

Hmm, Isaac's Step 1 looks right so far. He's got:

\( 60 = 1 + k \)

Now, I need to solve for \( k \). I'll subtract 1 from both sides...

\( 60 - 1 = 1 + k - 1 \)

\( 59 = k \)

Oh, wait! Isaac's got \( 61 = k \), not \( 59 = k \). That means his Step 2 is wrong.

So, Isaac's Step 1 is correct, but his Step 2 is incorrect.

The correct answer is... A) Only step \( 1 \).

I'm pretty sure that's right. I double-checked my working. Yeah, A is the one.
