## Step 1: Understand the given equation and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \). Isaac's steps are:
Step \( 1: \) \( 60=1+k \)
Step \( 2: \) \( 61=k \)

## 2: Verify Isaac's Step 1
To verify Step 1, we need to see if multiplying both sides of the original equation by 4 gives \( 60=1+k \).
So, \( 15 \times 4 = \frac{1+k}{4} \times 4 \) which simplifies to \( 60 = 1 + k \). This matches Isaac's Step 1.

## 3: Verify Isaac's Step 2
For Step 2, Isaac says \( 61=k \). Let's see if this is true by solving \( 60=1+k \) for \( k \).
Subtract 1 from both sides: \( 60 - 1 = k \), which gives \( 59 = k \).

## 4: Evaluate Isaac's Steps
Isaac's Step 1 is correct because \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) and \( \frac{1+k}{4} \times 4 = 1 + k \), so \( 60 = 1 + k \) is a correct manipulation of the original equation.
However, Isaac's Step 2 is incorrect because if \( 60 = 1 + k \), then \( k = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 5: Choose the Correct Answer
Given that only Step 1 is correct and Step 2 is incorrect, we need to select the answer that reflects this.

The best answer is A.
