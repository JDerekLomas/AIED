To solve this, I need to get \( \star \) on its own.

Given: \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \)

First, I want to get rid of the \( -\frac{3}{4} \) that's being multiplied by \( \star \). To do that, I need to... um... divide both sides by \( -\frac{3}{4} \), I think?

So, I'm going to do:

\( \star = -1 \div -\frac{3}{4} \)

I'm not really sure how to divide by a fraction... I think I'm supposed to... uh... multiply by the reciprocal?

So, that would be:

\( \star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} \)

I'm definitely not sure about the signs here... If I've got two negatives, that makes a... positive, right?

So, that would be:

\( \star = 1 \times \frac{4}{3} \)

\( \star = \frac{4}{3} \)

Let me just check that...

\( -\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1 \)

Hmm... I think that's right... The \( \frac{3}{4} \) and \( \frac{4}{3} \) cancel out or something...

So, my answer is:

A) \( \frac{4}{3} \)
