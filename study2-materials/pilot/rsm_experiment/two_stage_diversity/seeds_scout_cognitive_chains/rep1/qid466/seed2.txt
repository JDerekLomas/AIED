To find what replaces the star, I need to solve the equation:

\(-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1\)

First, I'll try to get \(\star\) on its own. I think if I divide both sides by \(-\frac{3}{4}\), that will do it. But, um, dividing by a fraction is the same as... multiplying by its... uh... reciprocal. Yeah, that's it.

So, I'll multiply both sides by \(-\frac{4}{3}\) (that's the reciprocal of \(-\frac{3}{4}\), right?).

\(-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1\)

 Multiplying both sides by \(-\frac{4}{3}\)...

\(\star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3}\)

Wait, is that right? Multiplying by \(-\frac{4}{3}\) on both sides...

\(\star = \frac{4}{3}\)

Hmm... Let's check. If I put \(\frac{4}{3}\) back in...

\(-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1\)

The \(3\)s cancel out and the \(4\)s cancel out... leaving \(-1 = -1\). Yeah, that looks right.

So, the star is... A) \(\frac{4}{3}\). Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

The answer is A.
