To find what replaces the star, I've got to get the star on its own, right?

So, I've got:
\[ -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \]

Um, I think I need to multiply both sides by... \(-\frac{4}{3}\)? No, wait, that doesn't seem right. Or is it \(\frac{4}{3}\)? Ugh, I'm getting my signs mixed up.

Let me try multiplying both sides by \(- \frac{4}{3}\) and see what happens...

\[ \star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} \]

Scratch that, I don't think that's right. If I multiply by \(-\frac{4}{3}\) on both sides, it would get rid of the \(-\frac{3}{4}\) on the left side...

So,
\[ -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \]
Multiplying both sides by \(-\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ \star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} \]
\[ \star = \frac{4}{3} \]

Hold on, I've got a feeling that's actually right, but I'm not 100% sure. Did I get the signs right?

The answer must be, A) \( \frac{4}{3} \).

So, confident that I got it right...(fingers crossed!). 

The best answer is A.
