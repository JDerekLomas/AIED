Um, let's see... so we've got \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \).

First, I think we need to, uh, get the \( \star \) on its own. So I'll... divide both sides by \( -\frac{3}{4} \).

So, \( \star = -1 \div -\frac{3}{4} \).

 Wait, how do I divide by a fraction again? I think it's... multiply by the reciprocal? Yeah, that's right.

So, \( \star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} \).

Multiplying a negative by a negative gives a... positive, right?

So, \( \star = 1 \times \frac{4}{3} \).

Which is just... \( \frac{4}{3} \).

Let me check if that's right... 

\( -\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1 \).

Yeah, that looks right. The \( 3 \)s and \( 4 \)s cancel out.

So, my answer is... A) \( \frac{4}{3} \).
