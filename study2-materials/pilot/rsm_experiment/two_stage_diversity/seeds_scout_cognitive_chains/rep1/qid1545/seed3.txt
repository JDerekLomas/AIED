## Step 1: First, let's write down the expressions given
We have two expressions: \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\).

## 2: Evaluate the first expression
For \(8+12 \div 4\), I think we need to do the division first because of BIDMAS (brackets, indices, division, multiplication, addition, subtraction), right? So, \(12 \div 4 = 3\). Then, \(8 + 3 = 11\).

## 3: Evaluate the second expression
For \((8+12) \div 4\), first do the thing in the brackets: \(8 + 12 = 20\). Then, \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 4: Compare the results
Now we compare: \(11 \square 5\). Hmm, \(11\) is greater than \(5\), so the symbol should be \(>\).

## 5: Choose the correct symbol
Since \(11 > 5\), the correct symbol to put in the box is \(>\).

## 6: Match the symbol to the given options
\(>\) matches option A) \(>\).

The best answer is A.
