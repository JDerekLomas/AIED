## Step 1
First, let's look at the equation given: \(8+12 \div 4 \square(8+12) \div 4\). I need to figure out what the symbol in the box could be.

## 2
To solve this, I should follow the order of operations, which is BODMAS: Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.

## 3
Let's start with the left side of the equation: \(8+12 \div 4\). According to BODMAS, I should do the division first. So, \(12 \div 4 = 3\). Then, \(8 + 3 = 11\).

## 4
Now, let's look at the right side: \((8+12) \div 4\). First, solve the brackets: \(8 + 12 = 20\). Then, \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 5
So, the equation now looks like \(11 \square 5\).

## 6
I'm not sure what the symbol could be... Let me think... If it's greater than, less than, equal to, or greater than or equal to... Hmm...

## 7
Wait, I think I can figure it out. \(11\) is definitely greater than \(5\), so it can't be \(B) <\) or \(C) =\). And it's not \(D) \geq\) because \(11\) is not greater than or equal to \(5\) in a way that it's exactly equal, it's just greater.

## 8
So, the symbol must be \(A) >\).

The best answer is A.
