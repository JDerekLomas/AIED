## Step 1: First, let's write down the expressions given
We have: 
\[ 8 + 12 \div 4 \square (8 + 12) \div 4 \]

## 2: Evaluate the expression on the left side of the symbol
To do this, I need to follow the order of operations, which is BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction). 
For \( 8 + 12 \div 4 \), I do the division first: 
\[ 12 \div 4 = 3 \] 
So, it becomes:
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

## 3: Evaluate the expression on the right side of the symbol
For \( (8 + 12) \div 4 \), I do the operation in the brackets first:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \] 
Then, I do the division:
\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

## 4: Compare the results of both expressions
Now, I compare \( 11 \square 5 \).

## 5: Determine the correct symbol
Since \( 11 \) is greater than \( 5 \), the correct symbol to use is \( > \).

## 6: Choose the answer from the given options
Given that \( 11 > 5 \), the symbol that belongs in the box is \( > \), which corresponds to option A.

The best answer is A.
