## Step 1
First, let's look at the equation: \(8+12 \div 4 \square(8+12) \div 4\). I need to work out what \(\square\) is.

## 2
To do that, I should follow the order of operations, BIDMAS or PEMDAS. This means I do division before addition in the left part of the equation: \(12 \div 4 = 3\).

## 3
So, the left part becomes \(8 + 3 = 11\).

## 4
Now, let's do the right part of the equation: \((8+12) \div 4\). First, add inside the brackets: \(8 + 12 = 20\).

## 5
Then, divide: \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 6
Now I compare: \(11 \square 5\).

## 7
Hmm... \(11\) is greater than \(5\), I'm pretty sure.

## 8
So, the symbol that belongs in the box is \(>\).

## 9
Wait, let me check if I did everything right... Yeah, looks good.

The best answer is A.
