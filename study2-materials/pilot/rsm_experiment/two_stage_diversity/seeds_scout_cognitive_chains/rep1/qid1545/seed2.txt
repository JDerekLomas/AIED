## Step 1: First, I need to solve the expressions on both sides of the box.
To do this, I should follow the order of operations, which is BIDMAS: Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.

## 2: Calculate the left side of the equation: \(8 + 12 \div 4\).
Following BIDMAS, I do the division first: \(12 \div 4 = 3\).
Then, I do the addition: \(8 + 3 = 11\).

## 3: Calculate the right side of the equation: \((8+12) \div 4\).
First, I solve inside the brackets: \(8 + 12 = 20\).
Then, I do the division: \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 4: Compare the two results.
The left side equals 11 and the right side equals 5.

## 5: Determine the correct symbol.
Since \(11 > 5\), the correct symbol to put in the box is \(>\).

## 6: Choose the answer from A/B/C/D.
Given that \(11 > 5\), the answer is A) \(>\).

The best answer is A.
