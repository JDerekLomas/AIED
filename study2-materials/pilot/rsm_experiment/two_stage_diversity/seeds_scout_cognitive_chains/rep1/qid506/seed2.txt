## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\).

## Step 2: Try to isolate \(p\)
To isolate \(p\), I need to get \(p\) on its own. I think I need to divide both sides by 3. So, I'll do that.

## 3: Divide both sides by 3
\(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\).

## 4: Figure out the division
I'm not sure how to divide a fraction by a whole number. I think it's like multiplying by the reciprocal of the whole number? Or is it? Let me try it as \(p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}\).

## 5: Multiply the fractions
\(p = \frac{1 \times 1}{12 \times 3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 6: Check the answer choices
Now, let me look at the answer choices: A) \(p = \frac{1}{4}\), B) \(p = \frac{1}{36}\), C) \(p = 4\), D) \(p = \frac{1}{9}\). My answer matches B.

The best answer is B.
