## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\).

## Step 2: Try to isolate \(p\)
To isolate \(p\), I need to get rid of the 3 on the left side. I think I need to divide both sides by 3.

## 3: Divide both sides by 3
Dividing both sides by 3 gives \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\).

## 4: Perform the division
I'm not sure how to divide a fraction by a whole number... I think it's like multiplying by the reciprocal? So, \(p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}\).

## 5: Multiply the fractions
Multiplying the fractions gives \(p = \frac{1 \times 1}{12 \times 3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 6: Check the answer choices
Let me see if \(\frac{1}{36}\) is one of the answer choices... Yeah, it is! B) \(p = \frac{1}{36}\).

The best answer is B.
