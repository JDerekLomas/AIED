## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\).

## Step 2: Try to isolate p
To isolate \(p\), I need to get \(p\) on its own. I think I need to divide both sides by 3. So, \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\).

## 3: Perform the division
I'm not sure how to divide a fraction by a whole number... I think it's the same as multiplying by the reciprocal? So, \(p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}\).

## 4: Multiply the fractions
Multiplying fractions, I get \(p = \frac{1 \times 1}{12 \times 3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 5: Check the answer choices
Let me see if \(\frac{1}{36}\) is one of the answers. I have A: \(\frac{1}{4}\), B: \(\frac{1}{36}\), C: \(4\), and D: \(\frac{1}{9}\). Yeah, B matches!

The best answer is B.
