## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\).

## Step 2: Try to isolate \(p\)
To isolate \(p\), I need to get \(p\) on its own. I think I need to divide both sides by 3. So, I'll do that.

## 3: Perform the division
\(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\).

## 4: Figure out the division by 3
I'm not sure how to divide a fraction by a whole number easily... Um, I think it's like multiplying by the reciprocal of 3, which is \(\frac{1}{3}\). So, \(p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}\).

## 5: Multiply the fractions
\(p = \frac{1 \times 1}{12 \times 3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 6: Check the answer choices
Let me see if \(\frac{1}{36}\) is one of the answers. I have \(\frac{1}{4}\), \(\frac{1}{36}\), \(4\), and \(\frac{1}{9}\). Yeah, \(\frac{1}{36}\) is one of them.

## 7: Confirm the correct answer
I'm pretty sure I got it right. The answer is B) \(p = \frac{1}{36}\).

The best answer is B.
