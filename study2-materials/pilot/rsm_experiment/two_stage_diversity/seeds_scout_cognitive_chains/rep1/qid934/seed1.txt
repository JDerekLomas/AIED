## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the table of values.
The equation given is \(4x + 2y = 10\), and there's a table with values for \(x\) and \(y\). I need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\), which is represented by \(\bigstar\).

## 2: Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation to solve for \(y\).
When \(x = 0\), the equation becomes \(4(0) + 2y = 10\). Simplifying this gives \(0 + 2y = 10\), which further simplifies to \(2y = 10\).

## 3: Solve for \(y\).
Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(y\): \(y = 10 / 2 = 5\).

## 4: Check if the solution makes sense and choose the correct answer.
So, when \(x = 0\), \(y = 5\). Looking at the options provided: A) \(20\), B) \(3\), C) \(5\), D) \(2.5\), I can see that my solution matches option C.

The best answer is C.
