## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the task
The equation given is \(4x + 2y = 10\), and we need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\).

## 2: Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation
When \(x = 0\), the equation becomes \(4(0) + 2y = 10\), which simplifies to \(2y = 10\).

## 3: Solve for \(y\)
Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(y\): \(y = 10 / 2 = 5\).

## 4: Check if the solution makes sense
The calculation seems straightforward: when \(x = 0\), \(y = 5\). This should be the value that replaces the star.

## 5: Choose the correct answer
Looking at the options provided:
- A: \(20\)
- B: \(3\)
- C: \(5\)
- D: \(2.5\)

## 6: Select the answer based on the calculation
From my calculation, \(y = 5\) when \(x = 0\), so the correct answer is the one that matches this value.

The best answer is C.
