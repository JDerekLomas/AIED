## Step 1: Understand the equation and the task
The equation given is \(4x + 2y = 10\), and we need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\).

## 2: Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation
When \(x = 0\), the equation becomes \(4(0) + 2y = 10\).

## 3: Solve for \(y\)
\(4(0) = 0\), so the equation simplifies to \(0 + 2y = 10\), which further simplifies to \(2y = 10\).

## 4: Find \(y\)
Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(y\): \(y = 10 / 2 = 5\).

## 5: Check the answer choices
The possible answers are \(20\), \(3\), \(5\), and \(2.5\). My calculation shows \(y = 5\) when \(x = 0\).

## 6: Select the correct answer
Based on my calculation, the correct answer is \(5\), which matches option C.

The best answer is C.
