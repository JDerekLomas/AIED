## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the table of values.
The equation given is \(4x + 2y = 10\), and there's a table of values with \(x\) ranging from 0 to 4 and \(y\) with one value missing, represented by a star (\(\bigstar\)) when \(x = 0\).

## 2: Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation to find \(y\).
When \(x = 0\), the equation becomes \(4(0) + 2y = 10\). This simplifies to \(2y = 10\).

## 3: Solve for \(y\).
Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(y\): \(y = 10 / 2 = 5\).

## 4: Confirm that this value corresponds to the star in the table.
Since \(y = 5\) when \(x = 0\), the star (\(\bigstar\)) in the table should be replaced by 5.

## 5: Choose the correct answer from the options provided.
Given that \(y = 5\) when \(x = 0\), I look at the options:
- A: \(20\)
- B: \(3\)
- C: \(5\)
- D: \(2.5\)

The answer is C.
