## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem gives us a table of values for the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\). We need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\).

## 2: Write down the equation
The equation is \(4x + 2y = 10\).

## 3: Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation
When \(x = 0\), the equation becomes \(4(0) + 2y = 10\).

## 4: Simplify the equation
\(4(0) = 0\), so the equation simplifies to \(0 + 2y = 10\), which further simplifies to \(2y = 10\).

## 5: Solve for \(y\)
To solve for \(y\), we divide both sides by 2: \(y = \frac{10}{2} = 5\).

## 6: Check the answer choices
The possible answers are A: \(20\), B: \(3\), C: \(5\), D: \(2.5\). My calculation shows \(y = 5\), which matches option C.

The best answer is C.
