## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem gives us a table of values for the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\). We need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\), which is represented by the gold star \(\bigstar\).

## 2: Write down the equation
The equation given is \(4x + 2y = 10\).

## 3: Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation
To find \(y\) when \(x = 0\), I substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation:
\(4(0) + 2y = 10\).

## 4: Solve for \(y\)
Simplifying the equation:
\(0 + 2y = 10\),
\(2y = 10\).
Dividing both sides by 2:
\(y = 5\).

## 5: Check the answer choices
Now, I check the answer choices to see if any match my solution:
A: \(20\),
B: \(3\),
C: \(5\),
D: \(2.5\).

## 6: Select the correct answer
My solution is \(y = 5\), which matches option C.

The best answer is C.
