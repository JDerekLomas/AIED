## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the table of values.
The equation given is \(4x + 2y = 10\), and we have a table of values with \(x\) ranging from 0 to 4, and \(y\) has a star (\(\bigstar\)) that needs to be replaced when \(x = 0\).

## 2: Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation to find \(y\).
When \(x = 0\), the equation becomes \(4(0) + 2y = 10\). This simplifies to \(2y = 10\).

## 3: Solve for \(y\).
Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(y\): \(y = 10 / 2 = 5\).

## 4: Identify the correct answer choice.
Given that \(y = 5\) when \(x = 0\), we look for the answer choice that matches this value.

## 5: Choose the correct answer.
The value of \(y\) that replaces the star is \(5\), which directly corresponds to one of the provided answer choices.

The best answer is C.
