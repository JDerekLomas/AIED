## Step 1: Write down the equation
The equation given is \(4x + 2y = 10\).

## 2: Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation
When \(x = 0\), the equation becomes \(4(0) + 2y = 10\), which simplifies to \(2y = 10\).

## 3: Solve for \(y\)
Dividing both sides by 2 gives \(y = 5\).

## 4: Identify the value to replace the star
The star is in the \(y\) row when \(x = 0\), so the value that should replace the star is \(5\).

## 5: Choose the correct answer
From the calculation, \(y = 5\) when \(x = 0\), so the correct answer is the option that matches this value.

The best answer is C.
