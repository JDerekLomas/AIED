## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the table of values.
The equation given is \(4x + 2y = 10\), and there's a table of values with \(x\) ranging from 0 to 4. We need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\), which is represented by \(\bigstar\).

## 2: Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation to find \(y\).
When \(x = 0\), the equation becomes \(4(0) + 2y = 10\).

## 3: Solve for \(y\).
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[0 + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]
\[y = 5\]

## 4: Check if the calculation seems correct.
It seems straightforward. If \(y = 5\), then \(2y = 10\), which checks out.

## 5: Review the answer choices.
The options are \(20\), \(3\), \(5\), and \(2.5\). My calculation shows \(y = 5\), so...

## 6: Choose the correct answer based on the calculation.
Given \(y = 5\), the correct answer is \(5\).

The best answer is C.
