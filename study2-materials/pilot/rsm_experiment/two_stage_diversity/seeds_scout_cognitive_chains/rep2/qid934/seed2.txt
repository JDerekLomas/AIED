## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the table of values.
The equation given is \(4x + 2y = 10\), and there's a table of values with \(x\) ranging from 0 to 4, and \(y\) has one value missing, represented by a star (\(\bigstar\)) when \(x = 0\).

## 2: Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation to find \(y\).
When \(x = 0\), the equation becomes \(4(0) + 2y = 10\). This simplifies to \(2y = 10\).

## 3: Solve for \(y\).
Dividing both sides by 2 gives \(y = 5\).

## 4: Confirm if this \(y\) value corresponds to the star in the table.
Since \(y = 5\) when \(x = 0\), the star (\(\bigstar\)) in the table should be replaced by 5.

## 5: Choose the correct answer based on the calculation.
From the given options, \(y = 5\) matches option C.

The best answer is C.
