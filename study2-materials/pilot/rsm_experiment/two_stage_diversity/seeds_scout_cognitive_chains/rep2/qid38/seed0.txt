To add these fractions, I need to find a common denominator. Um, I think it's... \(2x\)?

So, I'll write it down:
\[
\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}
\]

First, I need to make the denominators the same. I can do that by multiplying the second fraction by... \(\frac{2}{2}\).

So, it becomes:
\[
\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}
\]

Now I can add them:
\[
\frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}
\]

Hmm, I think that's right. I'm pretty sure I didn't make a mistake... *double-checks* 

Yeah, I'm going to go with it.

The answer is: A) \( \frac{11}{2 x} \)
