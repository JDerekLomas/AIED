To add these fractions, I need to get the denominators the same... um... so I have:

\[
\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}
\]

First, I'll try to get the denominators to match. If I multiply the second fraction by... 2, yeah, that'll make it \(2x\), right?

Wait, no... that's not right. If I multiply \(x\) by 2, I get \(2x\). So I need to multiply the top and bottom of the second fraction by 2:

\[
\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}
\]

Great, now I can add them:

\[
\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}
\]

Hmm, did I do that right? I think I did... let me check. Adding the numerators, 3 + 8 is definitely 11, and the denominator is \(2x\), so...

My answer is: A) \( \frac{11}{2 x} \)
