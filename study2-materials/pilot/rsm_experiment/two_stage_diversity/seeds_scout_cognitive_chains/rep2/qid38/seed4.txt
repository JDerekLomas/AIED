To write this as a single fraction as simply as possible, I'm going to try and find a common denominator for the two fractions.

The fractions are \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\).

Hmm... I think the common denominator is \(2x\), since \(x\) can fit into \(2x\) if I multiply it by \(2\).

So, I'll multiply \(\frac{4}{x}\) by \(\frac{2}{2}\) to get \(\frac{8}{2x}\).

Now, my working looks like this:

\(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}\)

Crossing out the old bits...

\(= \frac{3 + 8}{2x}\)

\(= \frac{11}{2x}\)

Wait, did I do that right? Yeah, I'm pretty sure...

So, my final answer is:

A) \(\frac{11}{2x}\)

Yeah, that's it! I'm going with A.
