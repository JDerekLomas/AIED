## Step 1: Understand what the mean is
The mean is like the average, right? To find it, we add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are.

## 2: Add up all the numbers given
The numbers are 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. So, we add them up: 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = ... um... 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 3 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8, 8 + 7 = 15. So, the total is 15.

## 3: Count how many numbers there are
There are... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 numbers. So, 5 numbers.

## 4: Calculate the mean
To find the mean, we divide the total by the number of numbers: 15 ÷ 5 = 3.

## 5: Evaluate option A
Option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). Let's see... 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15. So, it's \( \frac{15}{5} \) which equals 3. That looks right.

## 6: Evaluate option B
Option B is \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \). Hmm... I think we do the division before addition, don't we? Or is it the other way around? *scribbles* 7 ÷ 5 = 1.4, then 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1.4 = ... 9.4. No, that can't be right.

## 7: Evaluate option C
Option C is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \). Let's see... 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15. So, it's \( \frac{15}{4} \) which equals 3.75. That doesn't match our answer.

## 8: Choose the correct option
From what I've done, option A seems to be correct because it gives us 3, which matches our calculation of the mean.

The best answer is A.
