To find the mean, I think you have to add up all the numbers and then... um... divide by something.

The numbers are 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. So first, I'll add them up:

0 + 1 = 1
1 + 3 = 4
4 + 4 = 8
8 + 7 = 15

So, the total is 15.

Now, I need to divide by... hmm... how many numbers are there? Let me count them... 0, 1, 3, 4, 7... that's 5 numbers.

So, I'll divide by 5. The calculation is:

15 ÷ 5 = 3

But, I need to find which one of the options gives me this answer. 

A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \)

Let me calculate it...

\( 1+3+4+7 = 15 \)

\( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \)

That looks good...

B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \)

 Wait, is that... is that right? 

\( 0+1+3+4+7 = 15 \)

But then it's \( 15 \div 5 \) which is 3. So that's okay... but it looks a bit weird because of the way it's written. I think it's okay though.

C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \)

No, I don't think that's right because I'm dividing by 4, and there are 5 numbers.

\( 1+3+4+7 = 15 \)

\( \frac{15}{4} = 3.75 \)

That's not it.

D) None of them

I don't think that's right because A seems to work.

So, I'm going to choose... A. 

I'm pretty sure A is correct. Yeah, A.
