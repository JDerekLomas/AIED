To find the mean, we need to add up all the numbers and then... um... divide by something.

First, let's add up all the numbers:
\[ 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = ? \]

Starting to add them up... 
\[ 0 + 1 = 1 \]
\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]
\[ 8 + 7 = 15 \]

So, the total is 15.

Now, I think we have to divide by... hmm... how many numbers were there? *counts* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There are 5 numbers. 

So, to find the mean, we do:
\[ \frac{0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7}{5} \]
But wait, in the options, there's no one that exactly matches this... or does it?

A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) - that's missing the 0, isn't it?

B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \) - this one looks weird, because of the ÷ 5 at the end. I think that's supposed to be \( (0+1+3+4+7) \div 5 \) or \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \) but it's not written like that... Is that right, though? If I do it my way...
 
C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \) - that's dividing by 4, not 5, and it's missing the 0.

D) None of them.

But... option A) just seems wrong because it's missing the 0. B) looks wrong because it's not brackets. C) is wrong for two reasons. 

However... if I ignore the mistake in B) and just focus on what it's trying to say, 
\[ 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \]
If I do it in my head... ÷ and × are like equals... no, wait...

So A) is wrong definitely. You have to include the 0.

I now think... actually I made a silly mistake about B) – 
B) does actually look wrong... but is D) true...?

To properly assess, A, B and C can easily be disqualified. 

The actual calculation should look something like 
\[ (0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7) \div 5 \]
But... yeah...

Given A, B, C 

The final option is B - ugh not quite — And I disqualify it with:
My final answer is D)
