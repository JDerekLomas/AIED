To find the mean, we need to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are.

The numbers are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7

First, I'll add them up... um... 
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 3 = 4
4 + 4 = 8
8 + 7 = 15

So, the total is 15. There are... uh... 5 numbers.

Now, I'll divide... 15 ÷ 5 = 3

Okay, so the mean is 3. But I need to check the options.

A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) 
If I calculate it... 1+3+4+7 = 15
So, it's \( \frac{15}{5} \) which is 3. That looks right.

B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \)
Wait, that's not right because of the order of operations... I'd do the division first, so it's 7 ÷ 5 = 1.4, then add the rest... no, that's not right.

C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \)
If I calculate it... 1+3+4+7 = 15
So, it's \( \frac{15}{4} \) which is 3.75. That's not right.

D) None of them

Hmm... A looks good, but let me check if 0 is included in the sum... I think it should be.

A) doesn't have the 0, but is it okay? I mean, adding 0 doesn't change the sum... 0 + 15 = 15

So, A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) should still be... 3.

Therefore, my answer is: A)
