To find the mean, we need to add up all the numbers and then divide by... um... the number of numbers, right?

So, the numbers are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7

First, let's add them up: 
\( 0 + 1 = 1 \)
\( 1 + 3 = 4 \)
\( 4 + 4 = 8 \)
\( 8 + 7 = 15 \)

So, the total is 15. And there are... 5 numbers.

To find the mean, we divide by... 5! Yeah.

So, the calculation should be: \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \)

Wait, that's not an option. Let me check the options:

A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) 
- This one's missing the 0... but if I add the 0 to the top, it's the same as my calculation...

B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \) 
- This one's all wrong, because you have to do the addition first, then divide. The division should be outside the sum... I think.

C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \) 
- This one's dividing by 4, not 5... that's wrong.

D) None of them

Hmm... I'm gonna cross out B and C because they look wrong...

B - is definitely wrong because of the way it's ordered...

C - is wrong because it's dividing by 4...

So, A or D...

If I add 0 to A, it's the same as my calculation...

So, I'm gonna choose A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \)

The final answer is A.
