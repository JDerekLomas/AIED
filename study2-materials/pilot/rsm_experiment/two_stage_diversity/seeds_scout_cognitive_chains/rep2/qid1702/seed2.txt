## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is $10x - 6y = 30$.

## Step 2: Identify the given values
We are given $y = 0.5$ and we need to find $x$.

## 3: Substitute the given value of y into the equation
Substituting $y = 0.5$ into the equation gives $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$.

## 4: Perform the arithmetic with the substituted value
$10x - 3 = 30$.

## 5: Isolate the term with x
Adding 3 to both sides gives $10x = 33$.

## 6: Solve for x
Dividing both sides by 10 gives $x = 3.3$.

## 7: Check the answer choices
The calculated value of $x$ is $3.3$, which matches option C.

The best answer is C.
