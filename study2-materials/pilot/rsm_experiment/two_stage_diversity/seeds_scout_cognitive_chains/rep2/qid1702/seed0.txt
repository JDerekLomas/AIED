## Step 1: Write down the given equation and the table of values.
The equation given is \(10x - 6y = 30\), and the table of values is:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline\( x \) & \( \bigstar \) \\
\hline\( y \) & \( 0.5 \) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

## 2: Substitute \(y = 0.5\) into the equation to find \(x\).
To find \(x\), I'll substitute \(y = 0.5\) into the equation:
\(10x - 6(0.5) = 30\)

## 3: Solve for \(x\).
First, calculate \(6(0.5)\):
\(6(0.5) = 3\)

## 4: Continue solving for \(x\).
Now, substitute back into the equation:
\(10x - 3 = 30\)

## 5: Isolate \(x\).
Add 3 to both sides:
\(10x = 30 + 3\)
\(10x = 33\)

## 6: Solve for \(x\).
Divide both sides by 10:
\(x = \frac{33}{10}\)
\(x = 3.3\)

## 7: Choose the correct answer.
Looking at the options provided:
A: \(4.25\)
B: \(-4.25\)
C: \(3.3\)
D: \(2.7\)

The answer seems to be C: \(3.3\).

The best answer is C.
