## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is $10x - 6y = 30$.

## Step 2: Identify the given values
We are given $y = 0.5$ and need to find $x$.

## 3: Substitute the given value of $y$ into the equation
Substituting $y = 0.5$ into the equation gives $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$.

## 4: Simplify the equation
Simplifying, we get $10x - 3 = 30$.

## 5: Add 3 to both sides of the equation
Adding 3 to both sides gives $10x = 33$.

## 6: Solve for $x$
Dividing both sides by 10 gives $x = 3.3$.

## 7: Choose the correct answer
Comparing my answer to the options: A) $4.25$, B) $-4.25$, C) $3.3$, D) $2.7$, I see that my answer matches option C.

The best answer is C.
