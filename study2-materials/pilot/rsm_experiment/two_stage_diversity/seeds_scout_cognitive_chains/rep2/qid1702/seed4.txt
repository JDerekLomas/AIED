## Step 1: Understand the equation and the task
The equation given is \(10x - 6y = 30\), and we need to find the value of \(x\) when \(y = 0.5\).

## 2: Substitute \(y = 0.5\) into the equation
Substituting \(y = 0.5\) into the equation \(10x - 6y = 30\), we get:
\[10x - 6(0.5) = 30\]

## 3: Perform the multiplication
First, let's do the multiplication:
\[10x - 3 = 30\]

## 4: Add 3 to both sides
To isolate the term with \(x\), add 3 to both sides:
\[10x = 30 + 3\]
\[10x = 33\]

## 5: Solve for \(x\)
Now, divide both sides by 10 to solve for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{33}{10}\]
\[x = 3.3\]

## 6: Choose the correct answer
Looking at the options provided:
A: \(4.25\)
B: \(-4.25\)
C: \(3.3\)
D: \(2.7\)

The answer seems to match option C.

The best answer is C.
