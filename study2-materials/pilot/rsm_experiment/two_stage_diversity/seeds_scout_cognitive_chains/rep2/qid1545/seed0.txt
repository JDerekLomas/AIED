## Step 1: Evaluate the expressions inside the brackets and follow the order of operations
First, let's look at the two expressions: $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$. I know we have to follow the order of operations, which is BIDMAS/BODMAS - Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.

## 2: Calculate $8+12 \div 4$
For $8+12 \div 4$, I do the division first because it's before the addition in the order of operations. So, $12 \div 4 = 3$. Then, $8 + 3 = 11$.

## 3: Calculate $(8+12) \div 4$
For $(8+12) \div 4$, I do the calculation inside the brackets first. So, $8 + 12 = 20$. Then, $20 \div 4 = 5$.

## 4: Compare the results
Now, I compare the two results: $11$ and $5$. It looks like $11$ is greater than $5$.

## 5: Choose the correct symbol
Since $11$ is greater than $5$, the symbol that belongs in the box is $>$.

## 6: Select the answer choice
Given that $11 > 5$, I look at the options: A) $>$, B) $<$, C) $=$, D) $\geq$. The correct answer is A) $>$.

The best answer is A.
