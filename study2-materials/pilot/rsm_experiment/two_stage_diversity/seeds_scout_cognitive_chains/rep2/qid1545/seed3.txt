## Step 1: First, let's write down the expressions given in the question.
The expressions are $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$.

## Step 2: Next, I'll try to solve them step by step, starting with $8+12 \div 4$.
To solve $8+12 \div 4$, I need to remember the order of operations, which is BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). So, I do the division first: $12 \div 4 = 3$. Then, I add $8 + 3 = 11$.

## 3: Now, let's solve the second expression, $(8+12) \div 4$.
For $(8+12) \div 4$, I do the operation inside the brackets first: $8 + 12 = 20$. Then, I divide by $4$: $20 \div 4 = 5$.

## 4: Compare the results of both expressions to determine the correct symbol.
Now I have $8+12 \div 4 = 11$ and $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$. Let's compare them: $11$ is greater than $5$.

## 5: Choose the correct symbol based on the comparison.
Since $11 > 5$, the symbol that belongs in the box is $>$.

## 6: Select the answer from the given options.
The correct answer is A) $>$.

The best answer is A.
