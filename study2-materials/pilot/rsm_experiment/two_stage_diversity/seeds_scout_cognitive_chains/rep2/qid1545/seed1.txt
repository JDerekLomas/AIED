## Step 1: First, let's write down the expressions given
We have two expressions: \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\). I need to work out what they both equal.

## 2: Work out the first expression
For \(8+12 \div 4\), I think I need to do the division first... so that is \(12 \div 4 = 3\). Then I add 8, which is \(8 + 3 = 11\).

## 3: Work out the second expression
For \((8+12) \div 4\), I need to do what's inside the brackets first. So, \(8 + 12 = 20\). Then I divide by 4, which is \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 4: Compare the two results
Now I have \(8+12 \div 4 = 11\) and \((8+12) \div 4 = 5\). Let me compare them... 11 is greater than 5.

## 5: Choose the correct symbol
Since 11 is greater than 5, the symbol that belongs in the box is \( > \).

## 6: Select the answer choice
Given that \(8+12 \div 4 > (8+12) \div 4\), the answer must be A) \( > \).

The best answer is A.
