## Step 1: First, let's write down the given problem.
The problem is: \(8+12 \div 4 \square(8+12) \div 4\). I need to figure out which symbol goes in the box.

## 2: Next, I'll try to solve the left side of the equation.
For the left side, I think I need to follow the order of operations, which is BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction). So, for \(8+12 \div 4\), I do the division first: \(12 \div 4 = 3\). Then, I add: \(8 + 3 = 11\).

## 3: Now, let's solve the right side of the equation.
For the right side, \((8+12) \div 4\), I do the stuff in the brackets first: \(8 + 12 = 20\). Then, I divide: \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 4: Compare the two results.
So, the left side is \(11\) and the right side is \(5\). Hmm... \(11\) is greater than \(5\), I think.

## 5: Choose the correct symbol.
If \(11\) is greater than \(5\), then the symbol that belongs in the box is \(>\).

## 6: Double-check my work.
Let me just check my calculations... Yeah, I'm pretty sure I did them right. \(11 > 5\), so it should be \(>\).

The best answer is A.
