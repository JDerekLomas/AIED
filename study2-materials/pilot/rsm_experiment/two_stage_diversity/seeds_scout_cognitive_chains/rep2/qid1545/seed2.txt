## Step 1: First, let's write down the given problem.
The problem is: \(8+12 \div 4 \square(8+12) \div 4\).

## 2: I need to work out the left side of the equation first.
To do the left side, \(8+12 \div 4\), I should do the division before the addition, right? So, \(12 \div 4 = 3\), then \(8 + 3 = 11\).

## 3: Now, let's work out the right side of the equation.
For the right side, \((8+12) \div 4\), I should do the thing in the brackets first. So, \(8 + 12 = 20\), then \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 4: Compare the two results.
The left side equals 11 and the right side equals 5. Now, I need to compare them: \(11 \square 5\).

## 5: Decide which symbol goes in the box.
Since 11 is bigger than 5, the symbol that belongs in the box is \(>\).

## 6: Choose the correct answer from the options given.
Given that \(11 > 5\), the correct symbol is \(>\), which corresponds to option A.

The best answer is A.
