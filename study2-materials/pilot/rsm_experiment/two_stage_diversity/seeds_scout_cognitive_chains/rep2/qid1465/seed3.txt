## Step 1: First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is BIDMAS/BODMAS: Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.
The expression given is \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). There are no brackets or indices, so I will start with multiplication.

## 2: Calculate the multiplication part of the expression.
\(4 \times 2 = 8\), so the expression now looks like \(3 - 5 + 8\).

## 3: Next, I will perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.
First, \(3 - 5 = -2\).

## 4: Then, I add 8 to -2.
\(-2 + 8 = 6\).

## 5: Now, I'll check the answer choices to see which one matches my result.
The options are A) \(6\), B) \(4\), C) \(-12\), and D) \(-10\). My calculation equals \(6\), which matches option A.

The best answer is A.
