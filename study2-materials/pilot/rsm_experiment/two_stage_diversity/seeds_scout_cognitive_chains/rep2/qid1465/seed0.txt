## Step 1: Write down the equation
The equation is \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\).

## Step 2: Do the multiplication first, I think?
Yeah, I remember we do multiplication before addition and subtraction. So, \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

## 3: Replace the multiplication with its answer
Now the equation looks like \(3 - 5 + 8\).

## 4: Do the addition and subtraction from left to right, I'm pretty sure
First, \(3 - 5\). That's \(-2\).

## 5: So now the equation looks like
\(-2 + 8\).

## 6: Add them together
\(-2 + 8 = 6\).

## 7: Choose the answer
I'm pretty sure that's right... So, the answer is A) \(6\).

The best answer is A.
