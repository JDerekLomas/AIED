## Step 1: Write down the expression
The expression given is \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\).

## Step 2: Decide on the order of operations
I think we have to do the multiplication first... or is it addition? No, I'm sure it's multiplication before addition and subtraction. So, I will do \(4 \times 2\) first.

## 3: Calculate the multiplication
\(4 \times 2 = 8\).

## 4: Rewrite the expression with the multiplication result
So now it looks like \(3 - 5 + 8\).

## 5: Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right
First, \(3 - 5...\) um... that's \(-2\).

## 6: Continue with the rest of the expression
So now I have \(-2 + 8\).

## 7: Calculate the final result
\(-2 + 8 = 6\).

## 8: Choose the answer
That matches option A) \(6\).

The best answer is A.
