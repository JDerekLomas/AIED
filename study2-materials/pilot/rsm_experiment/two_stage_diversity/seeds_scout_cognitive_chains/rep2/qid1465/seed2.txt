## Step 1: First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.

So, I look at the equation: \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). There's no parentheses or exponents, so I start with multiplication.

## 2: I do the multiplication first: \(4 \times 2\).

\(4 \times 2 = 8\), so the equation now looks like this: \(3 - 5 + 8\).

## 3: Next, I do the addition and subtraction from left to right.

First, \(3 - 5\). I'm not sure if I'm doing this right... Um, 3 minus 5 is... -2? Yeah, that's right. So now it's \(-2 + 8\).

## 4: Now, I add \(-2 + 8\).

-2 + 8 = 6. I'm pretty sure that's right.

## 5: So, my final answer is... 

It looks like it equals 6. Let me check the options... A) 6, B) 4, C) -12, D) -10. Yeah, I'm going with A) 6.

The best answer is A.
