## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the task
The equation given is \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \). The task is to determine if Tom or Katie's suggested next line of working is correct.

## 2: Recall how to isolate x in an equation
To isolate \(x\), we need to get \(x\) by itself on one side of the equation. This usually involves getting rid of the constants on the same side as \(x\) first.

## 3: Evaluate Tom's suggestion
Tom suggests \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). Let's see if this is a valid step from \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \). If we add 5 to both sides of the original equation:
\( \frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5 \)
This simplifies to:
\( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \)
So, Tom's suggestion seems correct.

## 4: Evaluate Katie's suggestion
Katie suggests \( x - 5 = 36 \). Let's check if this is a valid step. If we multiply every term in the original equation by 3 to clear the fraction:
\( 3 \times \frac{x}{3} - 3 \times 5 = 3 \times 12 \)
This simplifies to:
\( x - 15 = 36 \)
Not \( x - 5 = 36 \), so Katie's suggestion seems incorrect based on this calculation.

## 5: Double-check Katie's suggestion with correct calculation
Wait, let me properly evaluate Katie's step without rushing:
The original equation is \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \). If we multiply every term by 3:
\( x - 15 = 36 \)
Adding 15 to both sides to solve for \(x\):
\( x = 36 + 15 \)
\( x = 51 \)

## 6: Verify both suggestions
Tom's suggestion was \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \), which we've established is correct by adding 5 to both sides of the equation.

## 7: Conclusion on Katie's mistake
Katie's error was suggesting \( x - 5 = 36 \) directly, which does not follow from the original equation. The correct step from the original equation to solve for \(x\) involves either Tom's addition of 5 or multiplying by 3 and then adjusting.

## 8: Determine the correct answer choice
Given Tom is correct and Katie is not, based on the direct derivation from the original equation.

The best answer is A.
