## Step 1: Understand the problem and what we're asked to do
We need to solve the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) and see if Tom or Katie's suggested next steps are correct.

## Step 2: Try to solve the equation myself first to understand it
Let's start with the given equation: \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\).

## 3: Add 5 to both sides to isolate the fraction
If I add 5 to both sides... that's \(\frac{x}{3} = 12 + 5\).

## 4: Calculate the right-hand side of the equation
\(12 + 5 = 17\), so \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\).

## 5: Check Tom's suggestion
Tom says \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), which matches my working. So, Tom seems correct.

## 6: Check Katie's suggestion
Katie says \(x - 5 = 36\). Let's see if that's a valid step from the original equation.

## 7: Manipulate the original equation to match Katie's suggestion
If I multiply both sides of the original equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction... I get \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\). Wait, no... I made a mistake in my head. Let's properly check: if \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\), then multiplying everything by 3 gives \(x - 15 = 36\).

## 8: Compare Katie's suggestion with my manipulation
Katie said \(x - 5 = 36\), but I found \(x - 15 = 36\). So, Katie's not correct.

## 9: Choose the correct answer based on my analysis
Since Tom is correct and Katie is not, the answer must be...

The best answer is A.
