## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the task
The given equation is \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \). The task is to determine if Tom or Katie's suggested next line of working is correct. Tom suggests \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \) and Katie suggests \( x - 5 = 36 \).

## 2: Analyze Tom's suggestion
To check Tom's suggestion, I'll add 5 to both sides of the original equation, like this:
\( \frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5 \)
Which simplifies to:
\( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \)
So, Tom's suggestion seems correct.

## 3: Analyze Katie's suggestion
For Katie's suggestion, \( x - 5 = 36 \), let's see if it aligns with the original equation. First, I'll multiply both sides of the original equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
\( \frac{x}{3} \times 3 - 5 \times 3 = 12 \times 3 \)
This becomes:
\( x - 15 = 36 \)
Not \( x - 5 = 36 \), so Katie's suggestion seems incorrect.

## 4: Double-check Katie's suggestion for confirmation
Let's properly derive Katie's line from the original equation and compare:
Original equation: \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \)
Multiply every term by 3:
\( x - 15 = 36 \)
Adding 15 to both sides:
\( x = 51 \)
To check Katie's claim directly: if \( x - 5 = 36 \), then \( x = 41 \). Let's see if \( x = 41 \) satisfies the original equation:
\( \frac{41}{3} - 5 = 13.67 - 5 = 8.67 \), which does not equal 12. So, Katie's suggestion is indeed incorrect.

## 5: Conclusion
Given that Tom's suggestion is correct and Katie's is incorrect, the answer is that only Tom is correct.

The best answer is A.
