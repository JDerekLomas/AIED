To solve this, let's first write down the equation and see what we're trying to do:

\[
\frac{x}{3}-5=12
\]

So, we need to isolate \(x\). 

## Step 1: Add 5 to both sides
I'm pretty sure the first step is to get rid of the -5 on the left side. So, I'll add 5 to both sides:

\[
\frac{x}{3}-5 + 5 = 12 + 5
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{3} = 17
\]

## 2: Check Tom's statement
Tom says a correct next line of working could be: \( \frac{x}{3}=17 \). Yeah, that's what I just did, so he must be correct.

## 3: Check Katie's statement
Katie says a correct next line of working could be: \( x-5=36 \). Let's see... if I multiply both sides of the original equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

\[
x - 15 = 36
\]

 Wait, no, that's not what Katie said. Let's try her step: if \( x - 5 = 36 \), then adding 5 to both sides gives \( x = 41 \), but let's check if it aligns with the original equation:

If \( x = 41 \):

\[
\frac{41}{3} - 5 = \frac{41}{3} - \frac{15}{3} = \frac{26}{3} \neq 12
\]

This doesn't seem right. Let me try multiplying the whole original equation by 3 to see if I can get something similar to what Katie said:

\[
x - 15 = 36
\]

Adding 15 to both sides:

\[
x = 51
\]

Let's put \( x = 51 \) back into the original equation:

\[
\frac{51}{3} - 5 = 17 - 5 = 12
\]

So, \( x = 51 \) is a solution. But Katie said \( x - 5 = 36 \), which means \( x = 41 \), and that's not correct.

## 4: Conclusion
Tom is definitely correct because \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \) is a correct step. Katie's step doesn't seem to directly follow from the original equation in a simple way without mistakes. 

The final answer is A.
