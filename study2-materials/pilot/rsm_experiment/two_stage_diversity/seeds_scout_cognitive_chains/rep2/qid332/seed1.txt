## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the proposed next steps by Tom and Katie.
The equation given is \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \). Tom suggests the next line of working could be \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \), and Katie suggests \( x - 5 = 36 \).

## 2: Evaluate Tom's proposed next step.
To check Tom's step, I add 5 to both sides of the original equation:
\( \frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5 \)
This simplifies to:
\( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \)
So, Tom's step seems correct.

## 3: Evaluate Katie's proposed next step.
For Katie's step, \( x - 5 = 36 \), let's see if it directly follows from the original equation:
The original equation is \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \).
If I multiply every term by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
\( \frac{x}{3} \times 3 - 5 \times 3 = 12 \times 3 \)
This becomes:
\( x - 15 = 36 \)
Not \( x - 5 = 36 \), so Katie's step seems incorrect based on this calculation.

## 4: Determine who is correct based on the evaluations.
From Step 2, Tom's proposed next step is correct. From Step 3, Katie's proposed next step does not correctly follow from the original equation, as it results in \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \).

## 5: Choose the correct answer.
Given that Tom is correct and Katie is not, the correct answer is the one that indicates only Tom is correct.

The best answer is A.
