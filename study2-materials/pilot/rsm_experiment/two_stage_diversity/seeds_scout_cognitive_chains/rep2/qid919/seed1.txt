## Step 1: Write down the equation
The equation is $y = 3x^2$.

## 2: Substitute $x$ with $0.3$
I need to find $y$ when $x = 0.3$. So, $y = 3 \times (0.3)^2$.

## 3: Calculate $(0.3)^2$
$(0.3)^2 = 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$.

## 4: Multiply by 3
Now, $y = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

## 5: Check the answer choices
The options are $0.81$, $0.27$, $1.8$, and $2.7$. My answer is $0.27$.

## 6: Choose the correct answer
That matches option B.

The best answer is B.
