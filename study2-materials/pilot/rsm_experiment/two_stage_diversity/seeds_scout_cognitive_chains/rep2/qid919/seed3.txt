## Step 1: Understand the equation given
The equation given is $y = 3x^2$. I need to use this to find $y$ when $x = 0.3$.

## 2: Substitute $x = 0.3$ into the equation
I'll put $0.3$ in for $x$, so it becomes $y = 3 \times (0.3)^2$.

## 3: Calculate $(0.3)^2$
$(0.3)^2 = 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$.

## 4: Multiply by 3
Now, I multiply $0.09$ by $3$, which is $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$.

## 5: Check my work
Let me just check that I did that right... yeah, $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$. That looks right to me.

## 6: Choose the answer
So, my answer is $0.27$. That matches option B.

The best answer is B.
