## Step 1: Understand the equation given
The equation given is \(y = 3x^2\). I need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0.3\).

## Step 2: Substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation
To find \(y\), I substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation \(y = 3x^2\). So, \(y = 3 \times (0.3)^2\).

## 3: Calculate \((0.3)^2\)
\((0.3)^2 = 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09\). I'm pretty sure that's right.

## 4: Multiply by 3
Now, I multiply \(0.09\) by \(3\). So, \(3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\). Yeah, that looks right.

## 5: Check the answer choices
The options are \(0.81\), \(0.27\), \(1.8\), and \(2.7\). My calculation is \(0.27\), which matches one of the options directly.

The best answer is B.
