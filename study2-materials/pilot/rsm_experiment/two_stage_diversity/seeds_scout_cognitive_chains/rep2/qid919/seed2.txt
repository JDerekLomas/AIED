## Step 1: Understand the given equation and what is required
The equation given is \(y = 3x^2\). We need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0.3\).

## 2: Substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation
To find \(y\), we substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation \(y = 3x^2\). So, \(y = 3 \times (0.3)^2\).

## 3: Calculate \( (0.3)^2 \)
\((0.3)^2 = 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09\).

## 4: Calculate \(y\)
Now, we calculate \(y = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\).

## 5: Choose the correct answer
Comparing our result, \(y = 0.27\), with the given options:
- A: \(0.81\)
- B: \(0.27\)
- C: \(1.8\)
- D: \(2.7\)

## 6: Select the correct option
Our calculation matches option B.

The best answer is B.
