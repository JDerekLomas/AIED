## Step 1: Understand the equation given
The equation given is $y = 3x^{2}$. I need to find $y$ when $x = 0.3$.

## 2: Substitute $x = 0.3$ into the equation
I'll substitute $0.3$ for $x$ in the equation $y = 3x^{2}$. So, $y = 3 \times (0.3)^{2}$.

## 3: Calculate $(0.3)^{2}$
First, I calculate $(0.3)^{2}$. That means $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$.

## 4: Multiply by 3
Now, I multiply $0.09$ by $3$. So, $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

## 5: Check my work
Let me check my work... $y = 3 \times 0.3^{2}$... yeah, I did it right. $0.3^{2} = 0.09$ and $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

## 6: Choose the correct answer
Based on my calculation, the correct answer is $0.27$. That matches option B.

The best answer is B.
