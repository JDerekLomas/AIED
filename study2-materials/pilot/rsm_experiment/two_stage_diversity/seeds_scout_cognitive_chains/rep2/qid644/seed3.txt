## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets (2p-1)(3p-4). The arrows are pointing at the -1 in the first bracket and the -4 in the second bracket.

## 2: Identify the terms to multiply
The terms are -1 and -4.

## 3: Multiply the terms
To multiply -1 and -4, I remember that two negatives make a positive. So, -1 * -4 = 4.

## 4: Write down the result
The result of multiplying -1 and -4 is 4. I'm pretty sure that's right... 

## 5: Choose the correct answer
Since the result is 4, which is positive, I look for the positive answer. That would be +4.

The best answer is A.
