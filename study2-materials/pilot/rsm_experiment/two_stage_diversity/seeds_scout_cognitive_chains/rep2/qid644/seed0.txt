To find the answer, I need to multiply the two terms indicated by the arrows. The terms are -1 and -4.

## Step 1: Multiply -1 by -4
-1 * -4 = ?... Um, I think when you multiply two minuses... it makes a plus? So, it's -1 * -4 = 4.

## 2: Write down the answer
So, the answer is... 4. But I need to choose from the options given. The options are A: +4, B: -4, C: +5, D: -5.

## 3: Choose the correct option
Since I got 4, and that's a positive number, I'll choose... A: +4.

The best answer is A.
