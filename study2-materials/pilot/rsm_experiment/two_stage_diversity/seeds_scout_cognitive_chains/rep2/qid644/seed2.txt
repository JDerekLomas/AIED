## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply the two terms pointed by the arrows, which are -1 and -4.

## 2: Recall the rule for multiplying negative numbers
When multiplying two negative numbers, I think you get a positive... or is it a negative? Hmm, I'm not sure. My teacher said something about two negatives making a positive.

## 3: Multiply -1 by -4
If I multiply -1 by -4... that would be... (writes) $-1 \times -4 = 4$.

## 4: Check the calculation
Wait, did I do that right? Multiplying two negatives should give a positive, right? So, -1 times -4 is indeed 4. (writes) Yeah, that's right.

## 5: Choose the correct answer
The answer I got is +4, which corresponds to option A.

The best answer is A.
