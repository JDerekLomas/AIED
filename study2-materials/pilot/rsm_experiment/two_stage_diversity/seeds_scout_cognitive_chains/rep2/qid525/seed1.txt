## Step 1: Convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions
To add these mixed numbers, \( 2 \frac{7}{10} \) and \( 2 \frac{1}{4} \), I think it's easier to first convert them into improper fractions. So, \( 2 \frac{7}{10} \) becomes \( \frac{(2 \times 10) + 7}{10} = \frac{20 + 7}{10} = \frac{27}{10} \). And \( 2 \frac{1}{4} \) becomes \( \frac{(2 \times 4) + 1}{4} = \frac{8 + 1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \).

## 2: Find a common denominator for the fractions
Now, I need to find a common denominator for \( \frac{27}{10} \) and \( \frac{9}{4} \). The denominators are 10 and 4. I think the least common multiple (LCM) of 10 and 4 is... um... 20? Yeah, that sounds right. So, I'll convert both fractions to have a denominator of 20. \( \frac{27}{10} \) becomes \( \frac{27 \times 2}{10 \times 2} = \frac{54}{20} \). And \( \frac{9}{4} \) becomes \( \frac{9 \times 5}{4 \times 5} = \frac{45}{20} \).

## 3: Add the fractions
Now that they have the same denominator, I can add them: \( \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} \).

## 4: Convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number
To leave the answer as a mixed number, I need to convert \( \frac{99}{20} \) back. 20 goes into 99... um... 4 times with a remainder, I think? \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \), and \( 99 - 80 = 19 \). So, it's \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \).

## 5: Choose the correct answer
Looking at the options provided: A) \( \frac{99}{20} \), B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \), C) \( \frac{99}{40} \), D) \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \). My answer matches B.

The best answer is B.
