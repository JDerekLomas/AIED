To find \( T \) when \( k = -3 \), I need to substitute \( k \) in the equation \( T = k^4 \).

## Step 1: Substitute \( k = -3 \) into the equation
So, \( T = (-3)^4 \).

## Step 2: Calculate \( (-3)^4 \)
I'm not really sure... I think it means \( -3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3 \) or is it \( -3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \)? No, wait, it's definitely the first one because of the brackets.

## 3: Perform the multiplication
\( (-3) \times (-3) = 9 \) (yeah, two negatives make a positive)

## 4: Continue with the multiplication
So now I have \( 9 \times (-3) \times (-3) \).

## 5: Next multiplication step
\( 9 \times (-3) = -27 \)

## 6: Final multiplication step
And then \( -27 \times (-3) = 81 \) (again, two negatives make a positive)

## 7: Conclusion
So, \( T = 81 \).

The best answer is A.
