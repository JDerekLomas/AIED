To find \( T \) when \( k = -3 \), I'll substitute \( k \) with \( -3 \) in the equation \( T = k^4 \).

So, \( T = (-3)^4 \)

Um, I think I need to do the power first... or is it the negative? Wait, no, it's the power. 

\( (-3)^4 = -3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3 \)

Okay, so multiplying negatives makes a positive... I think. So, \( -3 \times -3 = 9 \)

Then, \( 9 \times -3 = -27 \)

And then, \( -27 \times -3 = 81 \)

Oh, I'm pretty sure that's right...

So, \( T = 81 \).

The answer is: A) \( 81 \).
