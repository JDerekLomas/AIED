To find \( T \) when \( k = -3 \), I need to substitute \( k \) into the equation \( T = k^4 \).

So, \( T = (-3)^4 \)

Okay, so... \( (-3)^4 \) means... um... -3 times -3 times -3 times -3...

Let's see... first, \( (-3) \times (-3) = 9 \) (yep, that's right, two negative numbers make a positive)

So now I have \( 9^2 \)...

\( 9^2 = 9 \times 9 = 81 \)

Wait, what was the question again? Oh yeah... so \( T = 81 \).

I'm pretty sure that's right... 

The final answer is: A) \( 81 \)
