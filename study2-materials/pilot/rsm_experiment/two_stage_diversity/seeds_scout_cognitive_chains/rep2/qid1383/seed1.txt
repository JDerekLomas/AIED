To find \( T \) when \( k = -3 \), I'll just substitute \( k \) with \( -3 \) in the equation \( T = k^4 \).

## Step 1
So, \( T = (-3)^4 \).

## Step 2
I'm not really sure about the rules with negative numbers and powers... I think it's like, if the power is even, it's positive, and if it's odd, it's negative? Or is it the other way around?

## 3
Let me try it out... \( (-3)^4 = -3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3 \)

## 4
Okay, multiplying the negatives... Two negatives make a positive, so \( -3 \times -3 = 9 \), and then another two negatives make another positive, so \( -3 \times -3 = 9 \) again. Then \( 9 \times 9 = 81 \). So, yeah, \( T = 81 \).

## 5
I'm pretty sure that's right. I mean, an even power makes it positive, right?

The final answer is: A
