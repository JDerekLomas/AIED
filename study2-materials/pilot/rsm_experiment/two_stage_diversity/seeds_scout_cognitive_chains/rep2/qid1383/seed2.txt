To find \( T \), I need to substitute \( k = -3 \) into the equation \( T = k^4 \).

First, I'll write down the equation: \( T = k^4 \)

Now, substitute \( k = -3 \): \( T = (-3)^4 \)

Um, I think I need to do the power first... yeah, \( (-3)^4 \) means... -3 times -3 times -3 times -3...

Okay, so \( (-3) \times (-3) = 9 \)

Scratch that, let me write it properly:

\( (-3)^2 = 9 \)

So, if \( (-3)^2 = 9 \), then \( (-3)^4 = 9^2 \)

\( 9^2 = 81 \)

Wait, what was the question again? Oh yeah, \( T = ? \)

So, \( T = 81 \).

The final answer must be... A) \( 81 \). 

I'm pretty sure that's right...
