To find the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \), I need to remember what the division sign means in algebra...

Okay, so \( c \div(h+4) \)... that's like, \( c \) divided by \( h + 4 \).

So, if I write it out... 

\( c \div(h+4) = \frac{c}{h+4} \) 

Wait, that looks right, doesn't it? I mean, when you divide by something, it goes on the bottom, right?

But, let me check the others just in case...

A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \) - that's what I just wrote...

B) \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \) - that looks wrong because of the \( +4 \) on the top...

C) \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \) - that looks totally wrong because it's adding 4 to the whole thing, not just...

D) \( \frac{h+4}{c} \) - that looks like it's the other way around...

So, yeah... 

I'm going to choose... A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \) 

The final answer is A.
