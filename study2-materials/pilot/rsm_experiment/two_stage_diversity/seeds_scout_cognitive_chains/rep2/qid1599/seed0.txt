To find the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \), I need to remember what the division sign means in algebra...

Okay, so \( c \div(h+4) \)... that's like, \( c \) divided by \( h+4 \).

## Step 1: Understand the division in algebra
In algebra, division can be shown as a fraction. So, \( c \) divided by \( h+4 \) can be written as... \( \frac{c}{h+4} \).

## 2: Compare with given options
Let me look at the options:
- A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)
- B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)
- C: \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)
- D: \( \frac{h+4}{c} \)

## 3: Check for correctness
Option A looks exactly like what I wrote down... \( \frac{c}{h+4} \). That seems right because it directly represents \( c \) divided by \( h+4 \).

## 4: Eliminate incorrect options
- B adds 4 to the \( c \) which isn't right because the \( +4 \) is part of the divisor, not the dividend.
- C does something completely different; it adds 4 to \( \frac{c}{h} \), which again isn't right.
- D flips the \( c \) and \( h+4 \), which is not what we're doing here.

## 5: Final decision
I'm fairly sure... yeah, I'm going to go with A. 

The answer is A.
