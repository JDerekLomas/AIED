To find the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \), I need to remember what the division symbol means in algebra.

## Step 1: Understand the Division Symbol
The division symbol \(\div\) can be replaced by a fraction line. So, \( c \div(h+4) \) can be written as a fraction.

## 2: Rewrite the Expression
If \( c \div(h+4) \) means \( c \) divided by \( (h+4) \), then it looks like... \( \frac{c}{h+4} \).

## 3: Check the Options
Let's check the options given:
- A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)
- B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)
- C: \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)
- D: \( \frac{h+4}{c} \)

## 4: Match the Expression to an Option
My expression \( \frac{c}{h+4} \) looks just like option A. I think that's right... unless I got the brackets wrong.

## 5: Review and Confirm
Wait, does \( c \div(h+4) \) really mean \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)? That's what I put. It seems correct because we're dividing \( c \) by the whole \( (h+4) \) thing.

## 6: Final Check
Looking at the others:
- B adds 4 to \( c \), which isn't right.
- C divides \( c \) by \( h \) and then adds 4, which also isn't right.
- D flips the \( c \) and \( (h+4) \), which definitely isn't right.

## 7: Choose an Answer
Given that, the answer must be... A. \( \frac{c}{h+4} \).

The final answer is A.
