To find the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \), I need to remember what the division symbol really means in algebra... um... division is like... sharing, right?

So, \( c \div(h+4) \) means I'm sharing \( c \) into groups of \( h+4 \).

## Step 1: Understand the Division
The division \( c \div(h+4) \) can also be written as a fraction, where \( c \) is on top and \( h+4 \) is on the bottom. That's because when you divide by something, it's the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, but in fraction form, it's straightforward.

## 2: Write it as a Fraction
So, if I'm sharing \( c \) into groups of \( h+4 \), it looks like... \( \frac{c}{h+4} \).

## 3: Compare with Options
Now, let me look at the options given:

A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)
B) \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)
C) \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)
D) \( \frac{h+4}{c} \)

## 4: Eliminate Incorrect Options
Option B looks wrong because it adds 4 to \( c \), which isn't what the question says. 
Option C looks wrong because it divides \( c \) by \( h \) and then adds 4, which changes the order of operations and doesn't match.
Option D looks wrong because it flips \( c \) and \( h+4 \), which is the reciprocal of what we want.

## 5: Choose the Correct Option
The one that matches my working out is... A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \).

The final answer is A.
