## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks us to identify the correct algebraic convention for the calculation \( c \div(h+4) \). I need to find out what \( c \div(h+4) \) looks like when written properly.

## 2: Recall algebraic conventions
In algebra, division can be shown as a fraction. So, \( c \div(h+4) \) probably means \( c \) divided by \( (h+4) \).

## 3: Write it as a fraction
If \( c \) is divided by \( (h+4) \), it looks like... \( \frac{c}{h+4} \). Yeah, that makes sense.

## 4: Compare with the given options
Let's look at the options:
- A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)
- B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)
- C: \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)
- D: \( \frac{h+4}{c} \)

## 5: Check each option
- Option A is \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which is what I thought.
- Option B adds 4 to \( c \), which doesn't seem right.
- Option C is adding 4 to \( \frac{c}{h} \), that's not it.
- Option D is the inverse, \( c \) and \( h+4 \) are swapped, and it's \( c \) on the bottom.

## 6: Choose the correct option
Based on my understanding, \( c \div(h+4) \) equals \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which is...

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$
