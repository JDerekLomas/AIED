To solve the equation... um... \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\)... I think.

First, I'm going to... uh... multiply both sides by \(p\), I suppose. That gives me:

\(10p = 5\)

Wait, that's not right... I mean, I'm not sure if that's right. *crosses out*

Let me try that again. If I have \(\frac{5}{p} = 10\), then to get rid of the fraction, I multiply both sides by \(p\), so I get:

\(5 = 10p\)

That looks better. Now, I need to get \(p\) on its own. Um... I think I divide by 10 this time... or is it 5?

*scribbles*

\(p = \frac{5}{10}\)

\(p = 0.5\)

*looks at answer choices*

Oh, so \(p = 0.5\). That matches... A.

The answer is A.
