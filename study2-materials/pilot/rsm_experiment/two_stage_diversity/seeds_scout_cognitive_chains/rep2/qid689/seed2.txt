## Step 1: Write down the equation
The equation is \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\).

## Step 2: Try to get rid of the fraction
To get rid of the fraction, I think I need to multiply both sides by \(p\). So, I get \(10p = 5\).

## 3: Solve for \(p\)
Now, I need to solve for \(p\). I will divide both sides by 10. So, \(p = \frac{5}{10}\).

## 4: Simplify the fraction
\(\frac{5}{10}\) can be simplified to \(\frac{1}{2}\) or 0.5.

## 5: Compare with the given options
I got \(p = 0.5\). Let me see if it matches any of the options. Option A is \(p = 0.5\), option B is \(p = 50\), option C is \(p = 2\), and option D says there are no solutions.

## 6: Choose the correct option
Since \(p = 0.5\), that matches option A.

The best answer is A.
