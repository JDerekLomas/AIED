## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \( 10 = \frac{5}{p} \).

## Step 2: Try to isolate \( p \)
To isolate \( p \), I need to get rid of the fraction. I think I can do that by... um... multiplying both sides by \( p \)? Yeah, that should work.

## 3: Multiply both sides by \( p \)
Multiplying both sides by \( p \) gives me \( 10p = 5 \).

## 4: Solve for \( p \)
Now, I need to solve for \( p \). I can do that by... dividing both sides by 10, I think?

## 5: Divide both sides by 10
Dividing both sides by 10 gives me \( p = \frac{5}{10} \).

## 6: Simplify the fraction
\( \frac{5}{10} \) can be simplified to \( 0.5 \).

## 7: Check if the solution matches any of the given options
So, \( p = 0.5 \). Let me check the options... A) \( p = 0.5 \), B) \( p = 50 \), C) \( p = 2 \), D) There are no solutions. Ah, A matches!

The best answer is A.
