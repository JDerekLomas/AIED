## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\).

## 2: Try to isolate p
To isolate \(p\), I need to get rid of the fraction. I think I can do this by... um... multiplying both sides by \(p\). Yeah, that sounds right.

## 3: Multiply both sides by p
Multiplying both sides by \(p\) gives me \(10p = 5\).

## 4: Solve for p
Now, I need to solve for \(p\). I'll divide both sides by 10 to get \(p\) by itself. So, \(p = \frac{5}{10}\).

## 5: Simplify the fraction
\(\frac{5}{10}\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 5, which gives me \(p = 0.5\).

## 6: Check the answer choices
Let me see if \(p = 0.5\) is one of the answer choices. I have A: \(p = 0.5\), B: \(p = 50\), C: \(p = 2\), and D: There are no solutions.

## 7: Choose the correct answer
It looks like A matches my answer.

The best answer is A.
