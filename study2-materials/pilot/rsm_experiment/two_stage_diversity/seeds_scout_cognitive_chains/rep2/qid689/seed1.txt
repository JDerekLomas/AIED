## Step 1: Write down the equation
The equation given is $10 = \frac{5}{p}$.

## Step 2: Try to isolate p
To isolate $p$, I need to get rid of the fraction. I think I can do that by... um... multiplying both sides by $p$? Yeah, that sounds right.

## 3: Multiply both sides by p
Multiplying both sides by $p$ gives $10p = 5$.

## 4: Solve for p
Now, I need to solve for $p$. I think I'll divide both sides by $10$... no, wait, is that right? Should I divide by $5$? No, dividing by $10$ seems right.

## 5: Perform the division
Dividing both sides by $10$ gives $p = \frac{5}{10}$. I can simplify that...

## 6: Simplify the fraction
$\frac{5}{10}$ simplifies to $0.5$. So, $p = 0.5$.

## 7: Check the answer choices
Looking at the answer choices, I see $p = 0.5$ matches option A.

The best answer is A.
