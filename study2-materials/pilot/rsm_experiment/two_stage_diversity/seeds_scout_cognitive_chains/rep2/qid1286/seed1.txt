## Step 1: Recall the formula for the volume of a sphere
The formula for the volume of a sphere is \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \), where \( V \) is the volume and \( r \) is the radius.

## Step 2: Rearrange the formula to solve for \( r \)
To find \( r \), we need to rearrange the formula. First, I'll multiply both sides by \( \frac{3}{4 \pi} \) to get \( \frac{3V}{4 \pi} = r^3 \).

## 3: Solve for \( r \)
To solve for \( r \), I take the cube root of both sides: \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4 \pi}} \).

## 4: Compare with the given options
Comparing my result \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4 \pi}} \) with the options provided:
- A: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \)
- B: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \)
- C: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \)
- D: \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \)

## 5: Select the correct option
My result matches option C exactly.

The best answer is C.
