To solve this, I need to isolate the star (I'm gonna call it \( \star \) ). 

Given: \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \)

Um... first, I'm gonna divide both sides by \( -\frac{3}{4} \)... or is it multiply? No, divide, I think. 

So, \( \star = -1 \div -\frac{3}{4} \)

To divide by a fraction, I need to... um... multiply by its reciprocal?

So, \( \star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} \)

\( \star = \frac{4}{3} \)

But, wait, I'm not sure... Let me check...

If I multiply \( -\frac{3}{4} \) by \( \frac{4}{3} \), I get... (writes calculation)

\( -\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1 \) (ticks)

Yeah, that looks right...

So, I'm gonna choose... A) \( \frac{4}{3} \).
