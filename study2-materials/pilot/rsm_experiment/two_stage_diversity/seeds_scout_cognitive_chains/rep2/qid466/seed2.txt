To solve this, I need to get \(\star\) on its own.

## Step 1: Write down the equation
\(-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1\)

## Step 2: Isolate \(\star\)
To get \(\star\) on its own, I need to get rid of \(-\frac{3}{4}\). I think I need to... um... divide by \(-\frac{3}{4}\)?

## 3: Dividing by a fraction
I'm not really sure how to divide by a fraction... I think it's like multiplying by the reciprocal? So, I'll try multiplying both sides by \(\frac{4}{3}\)... no, wait, is that right? If I'm dividing by \(-\frac{3}{4}\), I should multiply by \(-\frac{4}{3}\)?

## 4: Apply the operation
Multiplying both sides by \(-\frac{4}{3}\):
\(\star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3}\)

## 5: Calculate
\(-1 \times -\frac{4}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\)

## 6: Check
Wait, did I do that right? It feels right... I was multiplying by the reciprocal of \(-\frac{3}{4}\) which is \(-\frac{4}{3}\) but then I changed my mind, and I think I actually used \(\frac{4}{3}\) in the calculation instead of \(-\frac{4}{3}\). Should I try again?

## 7: Rethink
If \(-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1\), then to get \(\star\), I do \(\star = -1 \div -\frac{3}{4}\). That's the same as \(\star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3}\). So, it's \(\frac{4}{3}\).

## 8: Final Check
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's right. \(\frac{4}{3}\).

The best answer is A.
