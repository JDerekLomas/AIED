Okay, so I need to find what the star is...

\(-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1\)

Um, I think I need to... divide? Yeah, divide both sides by \(-\frac{3}{4}\).

So, \(\star = -1 \div -\frac{3}{4}\)

Hmm... I'm not really sure how to do division with fractions. I think it's like multiplying by the reciprocal?

So, \(\star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3}\)

 Wait, no... that's not right. I mean...

\(\star = \frac{-1}{1} \times -\frac{4}{3}\)

No, that's still not it...

Oh yeah! I remember now. To divide by a fraction, you multiply by its reciprocal. So...

\(\star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3}\)

I'm pretty sure that's right...

So, \(-1 \times -4 = 4\) and \(3\) stays \(3\)...

\(\star = \frac{4}{3}\)

Yay, I'm done!

The answer is: A) \(\frac{4}{3}\)
