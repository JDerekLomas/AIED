To solve this, I need to isolate the star... thingy.

Given: \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \)

First, I want to get rid of the \( -\frac{3}{4} \) on the left side. To do that, I think I need to... um... divide both sides by \( -\frac{3}{4} \).

So, I'm going to write:

\( \star = -1 \div -\frac{3}{4} \)

Now, I'm not really sure how to divide by a fraction... I think it's the same as multiplying by the reciprocal? Yeah, that's right. So, this becomes:

\( \star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} \)

 Multiplying a negative by a negative gives a positive, right? So that's:

\( \star = 1 \times \frac{4}{3} \)

\( \star = \frac{4}{3} \)

Wait, I'm not sure if I did that right... Let me check.

Crossing out \( 1 \times \) 'cause that's obvious...

\( \star = \frac{4}{3} \)

Yeah, that's it.

The answer is A) \( \frac{4}{3} \).
