## Step 1: Understand the problem
I need to add two mixed numbers: \( 2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5} \).

## 2: Convert mixed numbers to improper fractions
To add them, it might be easier to convert them into improper fractions first. For \( 2 \frac{1}{5} \), I do \( 2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \), so it's \( \frac{11}{5} \). For \( 1 \frac{2}{5} \), I do \( 1 \times 5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7 \), so it's \( \frac{7}{5} \).

## 3: Add the improper fractions
Now, I add \( \frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} \). The denominators are the same, so I just add the numerators: \( 11 + 7 = 18 \). So, the result is \( \frac{18}{5} \).

## 4: Convert back to a mixed number
To convert \( \frac{18}{5} \) back into a mixed number, I divide 18 by 5. 5 goes into 18 three times with a remainder of 3, so it's \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \).

## 5: Check the answer choices
Looking at the answer choices, I see \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \) which matches my calculation.

The best answer is A.
