## Step 1: Convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions
To add these mixed numbers, \( 2 \frac{1}{5} \) and \( 1 \frac{2}{5} \), I think it's easier to first convert them into improper fractions. So, \( 2 \frac{1}{5} \) is \( \frac{(2 \times 5) + 1}{5} = \frac{10 + 1}{5} = \frac{11}{5} \) and \( 1 \frac{2}{5} \) is \( \frac{(1 \times 5) + 2}{5} = \frac{5 + 2}{5} = \frac{7}{5} \).

## 2: Add the improper fractions
Now, I add \( \frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} \). Since they have the same denominator, I just add the numerators: \( \frac{11 + 7}{5} = \frac{18}{5} \).

## 3: Convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number
To convert \( \frac{18}{5} \) back into a mixed number, I divide 18 by 5. 5 goes into 18, 3 times with a remainder of 3. So, it's \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \).

## 4: Check the answer choices
Now, I look at the answer choices. I have \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \), which matches option A. 

The best answer is A.
