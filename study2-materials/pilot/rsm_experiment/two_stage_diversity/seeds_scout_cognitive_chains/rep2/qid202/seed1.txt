## Step 1: Convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions
First, I need to convert \(2 \frac{1}{5}\) and \(1 \frac{2}{5}\) into improper fractions. For \(2 \frac{1}{5}\), I do \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\), so it becomes \(\frac{11}{5}\). For \(1 \frac{2}{5}\), I do \(1 \times 5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7\), so it becomes \(\frac{7}{5}\).

## 2: Add the improper fractions
Now, I add \(\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5}\). Since they have the same denominator, I just add the numerators: \(11 + 7 = 18\). So, \(\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}\).

## 3: Convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number
To convert \(\frac{18}{5}\) into a mixed number, I divide 18 by 5. 5 goes into 18 three times with a remainder of 3. So, it becomes \(3 \frac{3}{5}\).

## 4: Check the answer choices
I look at the answer choices: A) \(3 \frac{3}{5}\), B) \(\frac{18}{5}\), C) \(\frac{18}{10}\), D) \(3 \frac{3}{10}\). I think I got it right, but let me check... Yeah, \(3 \frac{3}{5}\) matches one of the answers.

The best answer is A.
