## Step 1: Convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions
First, I need to convert \( 2 \frac{1}{5} \) and \( 1 \frac{2}{5} \) into improper fractions. For \( 2 \frac{1}{5} \), I do \( 2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \), so \( 2 \frac{1}{5} = \frac{11}{5} \). For \( 1 \frac{2}{5} \), I do \( 1 \times 5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7 \), so \( 1 \frac{2}{5} = \frac{7}{5} \).

## 2: Add the improper fractions
Now, I add \( \frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} \). Since they have the same denominator, I just add the numerators: \( 11 + 7 = 18 \). So, \( \frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5} \).

## 3: Convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number
To convert \( \frac{18}{5} \) back into a mixed number, I divide 18 by 5. 5 goes into 18 three times with a remainder of 3, because \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) and \( 18 - 15 = 3 \). So, \( \frac{18}{5} = 3 \frac{3}{5} \).

## 4: Check the answer choices
Now, I look at the answer choices: A) \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \), B) \( \frac{18}{5} \), C) \( \frac{18}{10} \), D) \( 3 \frac{3}{10} \). I think I got it right, but let me make sure...

## 5: Quick sanity check
\( 3 \frac{3}{5} \) seems right because that's what I got. \( \frac{18}{5} \) is just the improper fraction, not a mixed number. \( \frac{18}{10} \) can be simplified to \( \frac{9}{5} \) which doesn't match. And \( 3 \frac{3}{10} \) is close but not what I calculated.

The best answer is A.
