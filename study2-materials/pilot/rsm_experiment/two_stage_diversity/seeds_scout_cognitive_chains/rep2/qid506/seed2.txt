## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\).

## Step 2: Try to isolate \(p\)
To isolate \(p\), I need to get \(p\) on its own. I think I need to divide both sides by 3. So, I'll do that.

## 3: Divide both sides by 3
\(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\).

## 4: Perform the division
I'm not really sure how to divide a fraction by a whole number... I think it's like multiplying the fraction by the reciprocal of the whole number? Or is it the other way around? Um... I think I need to multiply \(\frac{1}{12}\) by \(\frac{1}{3}\).

## 5: Multiply the fraction by \(\frac{1}{3}\)
So, \(p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}\).

## 6: Perform the multiplication
Multiplying the numerators and the denominators gives \(p = \frac{1 \times 1}{12 \times 3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 7: Check the answer
Let me see if \(\frac{1}{36}\) is an answer choice. Yeah, it is! B) \(p = \frac{1}{36}\).

The best answer is B.
