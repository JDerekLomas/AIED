## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\).

## Step 2: Try to isolate \(p\)
To isolate \(p\), I need to get \(p\) on its own. I think I need to divide both sides by 3. So, I'll do that.

## 3: Perform the division
Dividing both sides by 3 gives me \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\).

## 4: Figure out the division by 3
I'm not sure how to divide a fraction by a whole number easily. I think it's like multiplying by the reciprocal, but I'm not really sure. Or is it? I remember something about dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by \(\frac{1}{3}\)?

## 5: Apply the division or multiplication by \(\frac{1}{3}\)
So, \(p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}\). Let me calculate that.

## 6: Multiply the fractions
Multiplying the numerators gives \(1 \times 1 = 1\), and multiplying the denominators gives \(12 \times 3 = 36\). So, \(p = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 7: Check the answer choices
Let me see if \(\frac{1}{36}\) is one of the answers. A) \(\frac{1}{4}\), B) \(\frac{1}{36}\), C) \(4\), D) \(\frac{1}{9}\). Ah, B) \(\frac{1}{36}\) matches my answer.

The best answer is B.
