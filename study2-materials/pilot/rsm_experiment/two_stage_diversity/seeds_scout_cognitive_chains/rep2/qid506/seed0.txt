## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\).

## Step 2: Try to isolate \(p\)
To isolate \(p\), I need to get \(p\) on its own. I think I need to divide both sides by 3. So, I'll do that.

## 3: Perform the division
\(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\).

## 4: Figure out the division by 3
I'm not sure how to do \(\frac{1}{12} \div 3\). Is it the same as \(\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}\)? I think so... or is it? Let me try that.

## 5: Multiply the fractions
\(\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 1}{12 \times 3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 6: Write down the solution
So, \(p = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 7: Check the answer choices
Looking at the choices: A) \(p = \frac{1}{4}\), B) \(p = \frac{1}{36}\), C) \(p = 4\), D) \(p = \frac{1}{9}\). My answer matches B.

The best answer is B.
