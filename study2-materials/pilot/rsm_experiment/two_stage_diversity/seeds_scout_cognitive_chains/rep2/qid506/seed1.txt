## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\).

## Step 2: Try to isolate \(p\)
To isolate \(p\), I need to get \(p\) by itself on one side. I think I need to divide both sides by 3. So, I'll do that.

## 3: Divide both sides by 3
\(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\).

## 4: Perform the division
I'm not sure how to divide a fraction by a whole number... I think I need to multiply the fraction by the reciprocal of the whole number? No, that's not right. I mean, I can just multiply 3 by 12 to get 36, and then... uh... \(p = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 5: Check the calculation
Wait, did I do that right? Dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by \(\frac{1}{3}\), right? So, \(p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\). Yeah, that looks good.

## 6: Choose the answer
Looking at the options: A) \(p = \frac{1}{4}\), B) \(p = \frac{1}{36}\), C) \(p = 4\), D) \(p = \frac{1}{9}\). My answer matches B.

The best answer is B.
