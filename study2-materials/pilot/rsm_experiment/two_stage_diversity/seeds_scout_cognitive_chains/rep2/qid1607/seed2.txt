## Step 1: Understand the given equation and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \). Isaac's steps are:
Step \( 1: \) \( 60=1+k \)
Step \( 2: \) \( 61=k \)

## 2: Verify Isaac's steps
To verify Isaac's steps, let's solve the equation properly.
First, we multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction: \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \)
This simplifies to: \( 60 = 1 + k \)

## 3: Solve for k
Now, let's solve for \( k \):
\( 60 = 1 + k \)
Subtract 1 from both sides: \( 60 - 1 = k \)
So, \( k = 59 \)

## 4: Evaluate Isaac's steps
Isaac's Step \( 1: \) \( 60=1+k \) is correct because we got the same equation in Step 2 of our working.
Isaac's Step \( 2: \) \( 61=k \) is incorrect because we found \( k = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 5: Choose the correct answer
Since Step \( 1 \) is correct and Step \( 2 \) is incorrect, the correct answer is:
A) Only step \( 1 \)

The best answer is A.
