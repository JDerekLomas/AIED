## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \).

## Step 2: Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction
To get rid of the fraction, I multiply both sides by 4... so it becomes \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \), which simplifies to \( 60 = 1 + k \).

## 3: Check Isaac's Step 1
Isaac's Step 1 says \( 60 = 1 + k \), which matches my calculation, so... his Step 1 seems correct.

## 4: Solve for \( k \)
Now, I need to solve for \( k \). So, I subtract 1 from both sides... \( 60 - 1 = k \), which gives \( 59 = k \).

## 5: Check Isaac's Step 2
Isaac's Step 2 says \( 61 = k \), but I got \( 59 = k \), so... his Step 2 is wrong.

## 6: Determine the correctness of Isaac's steps
Since Isaac's Step 1 is correct but his Step 2 is incorrect, the correct answer is that only Step 1 is correct.

The best answer is A.
