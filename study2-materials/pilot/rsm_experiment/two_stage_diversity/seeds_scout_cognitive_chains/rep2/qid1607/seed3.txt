To check Isaac's steps, I'll do the question myself.

## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \).

## Step 2: Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction
Multiplying both sides by 4 gives \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \), which simplifies to \( 60 = 1 + k \).

## Step 3: Check Isaac's Step 1
Isaac's Step 1 is \( 60 = 1 + k \). This matches my calculation, so his Step 1 seems correct.

## 4: Solve for \( k \)
To solve for \( k \), I subtract 1 from both sides of \( 60 = 1 + k \), which gives \( 60 - 1 = k \), simplifying to \( 59 = k \).

## 5: Check Isaac's Step 2
Isaac's Step 2 is \( 61 = k \). This does not match my calculation of \( 59 = k \), so his Step 2 is incorrect.

## 6: Determine the correctness of Isaac's steps
Since Isaac's Step 1 is correct but his Step 2 is incorrect, the correct answer is that only Step 1 is correct.

The best answer is A.
