## Step 1: Understand the given equation and Isaac's steps.
The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). Isaac's steps are:
Step \( 1: 60 = 1 + k \)
Step \( 2: 61 = k \)

## 2: Verify Isaac's steps.
To verify Isaac's steps, let's solve the equation properly.
First, multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator: \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \).
This simplifies to: \( 60 = 1 + k \).

## 3: Solve for \( k \) and compare with Isaac's steps.
Now, subtract 1 from both sides: \( 60 - 1 = k \).
So, \( 59 = k \).

## 4: Evaluate Isaac's steps.
Isaac's Step \( 1: 60 = 1 + k \) seems correct because when we multiply 15 by 4, we indeed get 60.
However, Isaac's Step \( 2: 61 = k \) is incorrect because we found \( k = 59 \), not 61.

## 5: Determine the correctness of each step.
Since Step \( 1 \) is correct (\( 60 = 1 + k \) is a correct manipulation of the original equation), but Step \( 2 \) is incorrect (\( 61 = k \) is wrong, it should be \( 59 = k \)), we conclude that only Step \( 1 \) is correct.

## 6: Choose the correct answer based on the evaluation.
Given that only Step \( 1 \) is correct, the answer is:
The final answer is: A
