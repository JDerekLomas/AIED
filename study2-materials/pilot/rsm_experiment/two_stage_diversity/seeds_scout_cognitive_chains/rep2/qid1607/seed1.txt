## Step 1: Understand the given equation and Isaac's steps.
The equation given is \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \). Isaac's steps are:
Step \( 1: \) \( 60=1+k \)
Step \( 2: \) \( 61=k \)

## 2: Verify Isaac's Step 1.
To verify Step 1, we need to see if multiplying both sides of the original equation by 4 gives \( 60=1+k \).
Original equation: \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \)
Multiplying both sides by 4: \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \)
This simplifies to: \( 60 = 1 + k \)
So, Isaac's Step 1 seems correct.

## 3: Verify Isaac's Step 2.
For Step 2, Isaac says \( 61=k \). Let's check if this is true given Step 1 is correct.
From Step 1: \( 60 = 1 + k \)
Subtract 1 from both sides: \( 60 - 1 = k \)
This simplifies to: \( 59 = k \)
So, Isaac's Step 2 seems incorrect because he wrote \( 61=k \) instead of \( 59=k \).

## 4: Determine the correctness of Isaac's steps.
Given that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect, we can conclude that only Step 1 is correct.

## 5: Choose the correct answer based on the analysis.
Since only Step 1 is correct, the answer is A) Only step \( 1 \).

The best answer is A.
