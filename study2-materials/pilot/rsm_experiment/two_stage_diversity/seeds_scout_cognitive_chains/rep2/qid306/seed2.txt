## Step 1: Understand the problems
First, let's write down the problems: Problem P is \( 4-5+6 \) and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6 \). I need to figure out which calculation I should do first for each problem.

##  2: Recall the order of operations
I think there's a rule for this... isn't it like, you do addition and subtraction first, or is it multiplication and division? Wait, no... I remember! It's BODMAS! That stands for Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. So, you do operations in brackets first, then any powers (orders), then division and multiplication (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).

## 3: Apply BODMAS to Problem P
For Problem P, \( 4-5+6 \), there are no brackets, orders, division, or multiplication. It just has addition and subtraction. So, I should do these operations from left to right. That means I do \( 4-5 \) first.

## 4: Apply BODMAS to Problem Q
For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6 \), there are no brackets or orders. There is a multiplication and an addition. According to BODMAS, I should do the multiplication before the addition. So, I should do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 5: Choose the correct answer
Based on my understanding, for Problem P, I should do \( 4-5 \) first, and for Problem Q, I should do \( 5 \times 6 \) first. Let me look at the options... 

A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \) Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - No, that's not right for Q.
B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \) Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Yeah, that looks right.
C: Problem P: \( 5+6 \) Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - No, that's not right for either.
D: Problem P: \( 5+6 \) Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - No, not for P.

The best answer is B.
