## Step 1: Understand the problems
I have two problems to solve: Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \) and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). I need to figure out which calculation I should do first for each problem.

## 2: Analyze Problem P
For Problem P, \( 4-5+6= \), I think I should do the operations from left to right. So, first, I do \( 4-5 \) because it's the first operation I see. I write it down: \( 4-5 = -1 \), then I add 6.

## 3: Analyze Problem Q
For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6= \), I'm not sure... I think there's a rule about multiplication and addition/subtraction. My teacher said something about doing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So, I should do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 4: Determine the order of operations for each problem
For Problem P, it seems I should start with \( 4-5 \). For Problem Q, I should definitely do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 5: Match to the given options
Looking at the options:
- A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - No, that's not right for Q.
- B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Yeah, that's what I think.
- C: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - No, that's not right.
- D: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - No, for P, I think \( 4-5 \) first.

## 6: Choose the correct option
Based on my thinking, B seems right. I should do \( 4-5 \) first in Problem P and \( 5 \times 6 \) first in Problem Q.

The best answer is B.
