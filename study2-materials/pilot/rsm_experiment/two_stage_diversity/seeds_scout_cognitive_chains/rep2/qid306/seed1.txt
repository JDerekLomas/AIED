## Step 1: Understand the problems
I have two problems to solve: Problem P is \( 4-5+6 \) and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6 \). I need to figure out which calculation I should do first for each problem.

## 2: Analyze Problem P
For Problem P, \( 4-5+6 \), I think I should do the operations from left to right because there are no brackets and it seems like addition and subtraction are on the same level, right?

## 3: Decide on the first operation for Problem P
So, for Problem P, I would start with \( 4-5 \) because it's on the left.

## 4: Analyze Problem Q
For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6 \), I remember my teacher saying something about multiplication and division before addition and subtraction... or is it the other way around?

## 5: Decide on the first operation for Problem Q
Um... I think the multiplication comes first, so \( 5 \times 6 \) should be done before \( 4+... \) anything.

## 6: Match my decisions to the options
For Problem P, I said do \( 4-5 \) first. For Problem Q, I said do \( 5 \times 6 \) first. Let me look at the options...

## 7: Choose the correct option
Option A says Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and Problem Q: \( 4+5 \), which doesn't match my decision for Problem Q.
Option B says Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \), which matches what I thought.
Option C and D don't match my decisions.

The best answer is B.
