## Step 1: Understand the problems
I have two problems to solve: Problem P is \( 4-5+6 \) and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6 \).

## Step 2: Determine the order of operations for Problem P
For Problem P, \( 4-5+6 \), I think I just do it from left to right... so first I do \( 4-5 \) because it's the first two numbers.

## 3: Determine the order of operations for Problem Q
For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6 \), I'm pretty sure there's a rule about multiplication and addition/subtraction. My teacher said something about BIDMAS... which means you do Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. So, I think I do the multiplication first... \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 4: Compare my steps to the given options
For Problem P, I said do \( 4-5 \) first.
For Problem Q, I said do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 5: Match my steps to the options
Option A says Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and Problem Q: \( 4+5 \), which doesn't match because for Problem Q, I think the multiplication comes first.
Option B says Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \), which matches my thinking.
Option C and D don't match my steps.

## 6: Choose the correct answer
Based on my steps, the answer is B.

The best answer is B.
