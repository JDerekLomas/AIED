## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). I think we're using the FOIL method for this... or is it something else? Yeah, FOIL.

## 2: Apply the FOIL method
FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. So I do:
- First: \(m \times m = m^2\)
- Outer: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
- Inner: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
- Last: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)

## 3: Combine like terms
Now I add them all together: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\).
Combining like terms: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 4: Check my work
Let me just check... did I do that right? \(m^2 - 7m - 5m\) is definitely \(m^2 - 12m\), and then \(+35\)... yeah, looks good.

## 5: Choose my answer
So, my answer is \(m^2 - 12m + 35\), which is... B.

The best answer is B.
