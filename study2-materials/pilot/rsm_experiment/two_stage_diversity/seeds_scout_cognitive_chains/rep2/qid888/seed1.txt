## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). I'm not really sure how to do this, but I think it's something to do with multiplying each bit inside the brackets by each other bit.

## 2: Attempt to apply the method
Okay, so I multiply \(m\) by \(m\), which gives \(m^2\). Then I multiply \(m\) by \(-7\), which gives \(-7m\). Next, I multiply \(-5\) by \(m\), which gives \(-5m\). And finally, I multiply \(-5\) by \(-7\), which gives... um... \(35\), right? Because two negatives make a positive.

## 3: Write down the working
So, I have: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\).

## 4: Simplify
Now I need to simplify. I can combine the \(-7m\) and \(-5m\) to get \(-12m\). So, it becomes: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 5: Check the working
Let me check if that looks right... Yeah, that looks good. I'm pretty sure that's correct.

## 6: Choose the answer
Given my working, \(m^2 - 12m + 35\), I think the answer is... B) \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

The best answer is B.
