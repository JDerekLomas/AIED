## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem asks me to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). I think I've done something like this before, but I'm not really sure how it works.

## 2: Recall the method
Um, I think you have to multiply each thing in the first bracket by each thing in the second bracket... Yeah, that's right! So, it's \(m \times m\) and \(m \times -7\) and \(-5 \times m\) and \(-5 \times -7\).

## 3: Perform the multiplication
Okay, so \(m \times m = m^2\), \(m \times -7 = -7m\), \(-5 \times m = -5m\), and \(-5 \times -7 = 35\). I'm pretty sure that's right.

## 4: Combine like terms
Now I add them all together: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\). I think I can combine the \(-7m\) and \(-5m\)... That's \(-12m\), right? So, it becomes \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 5: Check the work
Let me just check... \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\)... Yeah, that looks good. \(-7m - 5m = -12m\), so \(m^2 - 12m + 35\). I'm fairly sure that's correct.

## 6: Choose the answer
Okay, so my answer is \(m^2 - 12m + 35\). That matches option B.

The best answer is B.
