## Step 1: Understand the problem
I need to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). I'm not really sure how to do this, but I think we're supposed to use FOIL or something?

## 2: Recall FOIL method
FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. So, I multiply the first terms in each bracket, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, and finally the last terms in each bracket.

## 3: Apply FOIL method
First: \(m \times m = m^2\)

Outer: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)

Inner: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)

Last: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)

## 4: Combine like terms
Now I add them all together: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\).

## 5: Simplify
Combine the \(m\) terms: \(-7m - 5m = -12m\). So, it simplifies to: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 6: Check for mistakes
Wait, did I do that right? Let me check... Yeah, that looks right.

## 7: Choose the correct answer
Based on my working: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\), the correct answer is...

The best answer is B.
