## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply out the brackets for the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\).

## 2: Recall the method for multiplying out brackets
I'm pretty sure we use the FOIL method for this. FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. So, I multiply the first terms in each bracket, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, and finally the last terms in each bracket.

## 3: Apply the FOIL method
Okay, so applying FOIL:
- First: \(m \times m = m^2\)
- Outer: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
- Inner: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
- Last: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)

## 4: Combine like terms
Now, I add all these together: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\).

## 5: Simplify
Combining like terms: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 6: Write down my answer
So, my answer is \(m^2 - 12m + 35\). I'm pretty confident that's right.

## 7: Choose the correct option
Looking at the options:
A: \(m^2 - 2m - 35\)
B: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\)
C: \(m^2 + 12m + 35\)
D: \(m^2 - 12m - 35\)

My answer matches option B.

The best answer is B.
