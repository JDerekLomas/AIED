To solve this, I think I need to... um... get the star on its own, right?

So, I've got: \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \)

First, I'll... multiply both sides by -1, no, wait, that's not right. I need to get rid of the \( -\frac{3}{4} \) on the left side. So, I'll... divide both sides by \( -\frac{3}{4} \).

\( \star = -1 \div -\frac{3}{4} \)

Hmm... dividing by a fraction... I think I need to... multiply by the reciprocal? Yeah, that's it.

So, it becomes: \( \star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} \)

Crossing out the -1, I'll just write it as \( 1 \times -\frac{4}{3} \) no, wait, I mean... 

\( \star = 1 \times \frac{4}{3} \)

No... I wrote that down wrong. It should be:

\( \star = \frac{4}{3} \)

But, I was dividing by a negative, so... does that change it?

Uh... \( -\times- = + \), so... 

I'm getting confused... Wait, so I had: \( \star = -1 \div -\frac{3}{4} \)

Which is the same as: \( \star = \frac{-1}{1} \div \frac{-3}{4} \)

To divide, I multiply by the reciprocal:

\( \star = \frac{-1}{1} \times \frac{4}{-3} \)

\( \star = \frac{4}{3} \)

Looking at my options:

A) \( \frac{4}{3} \)

B) \( -\frac{4}{3} \)

C) \( \frac{3}{4} \)

D) \( -\frac{3}{4} \)

My answer is... A) \( \frac{4}{3} \). I'm fairly sure... hope I didn't mess up!
