To solve this, I need to isolate the star... thingy.

Given: \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \)

Um, okay... so I want to get \(\star\) on its own. To do that, I need to get rid of the \(-\frac{3}{4}\) that's being multiplied by it. So, I'll... divide both sides by \(-\frac{3}{4}\)?

\(-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1\)

Become:

\(\star = -1 \div -\frac{3}{4}\)

Hmm... dividing by a fraction is the same as... uh... multiplying by its reciprocal, right?

So, this becomes:

\(\star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3}\)

Oh, and multiplying two negatives gives a... positive!

\(\star = 1 \times \frac{4}{3}\)

\(\star = \frac{4}{3}\)

Wait, did I do that right? Let me check...

\(-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1\), yeah that looks right because the \(3\)s and \(4\)s cancel out.

So, I'm going to go with... A) \( \frac{4}{3} \).

The answer is A.
