## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem is to solve for the star (★) in the equation \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \).

## Step 2: Try to isolate the star
To isolate the star, I need to get rid of the \( -\frac{3}{4} \) that is being multiplied by it. I think I can do this by dividing both sides by \( -\frac{3}{4} \). So, I'll write:

\( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \)

## 3: Perform the division
Dividing both sides by \( -\frac{3}{4} \) gives me:

\( \star = -1 \div -\frac{3}{4} \)

## 4: Remember how to divide by a fraction
I'm not really sure how to divide by a fraction... I think it's like multiplying by the reciprocal? So, I will try that:

\( \star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} \)

## 5: Multiply
Now, I'll multiply:

\( \star = 1 \times \frac{4}{3} \) because two negatives make a positive

\( \star = \frac{4}{3} \)

## 6: Choose the answer
Looking at my answer \( \frac{4}{3} \), I see that it matches option A.

The best answer is A.
