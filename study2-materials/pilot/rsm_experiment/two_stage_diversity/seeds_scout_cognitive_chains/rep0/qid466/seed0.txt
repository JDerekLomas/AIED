To solve this, I think I need to... um... isolate the star, right?

So I've got: \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \)

I'm going to multiply both sides by... \( -\frac{4}{3} \) to get rid of the \( -\frac{3}{4} \).

 Wait, is that right? Multiplying by \( -\frac{4}{3} \) will cancel out the \( -\frac{3}{4} \), yeah?

So: 
\[ 
\begin{aligned}
-\frac{3}{4} \times \star &\times \left( -\frac{4}{3} \right) = -1 \times \left( -\frac{4}{3} \right) \\
\star &\times \left( -\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{4}{3} \right) = \frac{4}{3} \\
\star &\times 1 = \frac{4}{3} 
\end{aligned}
\]

It looks like... \( \star = \frac{4}{3} \).

So, my answer is... A) \( \frac{4}{3} \). Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's right! 

The answer is A.
