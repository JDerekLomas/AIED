## Step 1: Understand the problem and the equation given
The equation given is \(4x + 2y = 10\), and we need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\).

## Step 2: Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation
Substituting \(x = 0\) into \(4x + 2y = 10\), I get \(4(0) + 2y = 10\).

## 3: Simplify the equation
This simplifies to \(0 + 2y = 10\), which further simplifies to \(2y = 10\).

## 4: Solve for \(y\)
To solve for \(y\), I divide both sides by 2, so \(y = 10 / 2 = 5\).

## 5: Identify the correct answer choice
Comparing my answer to the options provided: A) \(20\), B) \(3\), C) \(5\), D) \(2.5\), I see that my answer matches option C) \(5\).

The best answer is C.
