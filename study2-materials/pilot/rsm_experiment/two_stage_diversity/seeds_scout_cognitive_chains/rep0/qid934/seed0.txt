## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the table of values.
The equation given is \(4x + 2y = 10\), and we have a table of values for \(x\) and \(y\). The table is:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline\( x \) & \( 0 \) & \( 1 \) & \( 2 \) & \( 3 \) & \( 4 \) \\
\hline\( y \) & \( \color{gold}\bigstar \) &   
\end{tabular}
We need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\), which is represented by \(\bigstar\).

## 2: Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) to find \(y\).
When \(x = 0\), the equation becomes:
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[0 + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]
Now, I need to solve for \(y\).

## 3: Solve for \(y\).
Divide both sides by 2:
\[y = \frac{10}{2}\]
\[y = 5\]
So, when \(x = 0\), \(y = 5\). That means \(\bigstar = 5\).

## 4: Choose the correct answer from the given options.
The options are:
A: \(20\)
B: \(3\)
C: \(5\)
D: \(2.5\)
From my calculation, \(\bigstar = 5\), which matches option C.

The best answer is C.
