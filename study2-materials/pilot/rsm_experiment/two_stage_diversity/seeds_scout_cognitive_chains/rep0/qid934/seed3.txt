## Step 1: Write down the equation
The equation given is \(4x + 2y = 10\).

## Step 2: Identify the value of x for the star
The star is at \(x = 0\).

## 3: Substitute x = 0 into the equation
Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\), I get:
\(4(0) + 2y = 10\)

## 4: Solve for y
This simplifies to:
\(0 + 2y = 10\)
\(2y = 10\)
\(y = 10 / 2\)
\(y = 5\)

## 5: Check the answer choices
So, the value that should replace the star is \(5\). Let's check the answer choices:
A) \(20\)
B) \(3\)
C) \(5\)
D) \(2.5\)

## 6: Select the correct answer
The correct answer is C) \(5\).

The best answer is C.
