## Step 1: Understand the equation and the task
The equation given is \(4x + 2y = 10\), and we need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\).

## 2: Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation
When \(x = 0\), the equation becomes \(4(0) + 2y = 10\).

## 3: Simplify the equation
\(4(0) = 0\), so the equation simplifies to \(0 + 2y = 10\), which further simplifies to \(2y = 10\).

## 4: Solve for \(y\)
To solve for \(y\), divide both sides by 2: \(y = 10 / 2 = 5\).

## 5: Identify the correct answer choice
The calculated value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\) is \(5\). Now, let's look at the answer choices: A) \(20\), B) \(3\), C) \(5\), D) \(2.5\).

## 6: Select the answer
From the calculations, \(y = 5\) when \(x = 0\), which matches option C) \(5\).

The best answer is C.
