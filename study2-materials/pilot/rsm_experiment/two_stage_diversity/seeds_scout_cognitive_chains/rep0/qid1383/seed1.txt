To find the value of \( T \) when \( k = -3 \), I'll substitute \( k \) into the equation \( T = k^4 \).

First, I'll write down the equation with \( k = -3 \) substituted in:

\( T = (-3)^4 \)

Hmm... when you have a power of 4, does that mean you multiply the number by itself 4 times? So, I'll try that:

\( T = (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \)

Okay, let me do it step by step...

\( (-3) \times (-3) = 9 \)

So now I've got:

\( T = 9 \times (-3) \times (-3) \)

Next:

\( 9 \times (-3) = -27 \)

Wait, that's not right... if I multiply two negatives, I get a positive. So:

\( 9 \times (-3) = -27 \)

But then I multiply by another -3:

\( -27 \times (-3) = 81 \)

Yay, got it!

So, there we go:

The final answer is: A) \( 81 \)
