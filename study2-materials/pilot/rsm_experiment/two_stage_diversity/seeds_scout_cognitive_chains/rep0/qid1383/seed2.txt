## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem gives us an equation \( T = k^4 \) and asks us to find the value of \( T \) when \( k = -3 \).

## 2: Substitute \( k = -3 \) into the equation
To find \( T \), we need to substitute \( k = -3 \) into the equation \( T = k^4 \). So, \( T = (-3)^4 \).

## 3: Calculate \( (-3)^4 \)
I'm not sure if I remember this correctly, but I think it means multiplying -3 by itself 4 times. So, \( (-3)^4 = -3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3 \).

## 4: Perform the multiplication
Okay, let me do this step by step. \( -3 \times -3 = 9 \), because two negatives make a positive.

## 5: Continue the multiplication
Then, \( 9 \times -3 = -27 \), because a positive times a negative makes a negative.

## 6: Final multiplication step
And then, \( -27 \times -3 = 81 \), because again, two negatives make a positive.

## 7: Check the calculation
Wait, did I do that right? \( (-3)^4 = 81 \). Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's right. I remember that \( (-a)^n \) is positive when \( n \) is even.

## 8: Choose the answer
Given my calculation, \( T = 81 \) when \( k = -3 \). So, the answer must be A) \( 81 \).

The best answer is A.
