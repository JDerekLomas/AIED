To find \( T \) when \( k = -3 \), I need to substitute \( k \) into the equation \( T = k^4 \).

## Step 1: Write down the equation with k substituted
\( T = (-3)^4 \)

## 2: Calculate \( (-3)^4 \)
I'm not really sure... I think it means multiplying -3 by itself 4 times? So, \( (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \).

## 3: Do the multiplication step by step
First, \( (-3) \times (-3) = 9 \) because two negatives make a positive.

## 4: Continue the multiplication
Then, \( 9 \times (-3) = -27 \).

## 5: Final step of multiplication
And then, \( -27 \times (-3) = 81 \) because, again, two negatives make a positive.

## 6: Write down the answer
So, \( T = 81 \).

## 7: Check the options
Looking at the options: A) \( 81 \), B) \( 12 \), C) \( -81 \), D) \( -12 \). My answer matches option A.

The best answer is A.
