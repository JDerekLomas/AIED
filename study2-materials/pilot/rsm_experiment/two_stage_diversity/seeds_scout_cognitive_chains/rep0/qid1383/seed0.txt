\( T=k^{4} \)

so... if \( k=-3 \)

\( T = (-3)^{4} \)

um... I'm pretty sure it's... 

\( T = -3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3 \)

 Wait, no... that's not right... I think I gotta do it in steps...

\( -3 \times -3 = 9 \) (I think, is that right?)

so... 
\( 9 \times -3 = -27 \) no... that's not it...

\( -3 \times -3 = 9 \)

and \( 9 \times 9 = 81 \) (Yeah! That's right!)

So... 
\( T = 81 \)

(I'm pretty sure... Did I do it right? )

So the answer is... A) \( 81 \)

Yep, A.
