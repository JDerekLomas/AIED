Here's my working:

\( T = k^4 \)

Given \( k = -3 \), so...

\( T = (-3)^4 \)

Hmm... do I do the power first or...? No, I think I do the power first.

So, \( (-3)^4 \) means... -3 x -3 x -3 x -3...?

Let me see...

-3 x -3 = 9 (yep, that's right)

9 x -3 = -27 (wait, is that right?)

-27 x -3 = 81 (oh, I think I got it)

So...

\( T = 81 \)

I'm pretty sure that's right... *crosses out previous line* 

No, actually I'm definitely sure... yeah.

The answer is:
A) \( 81 \)
