To find the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \), let's break it down step by step...

First, I think when you divide by something, it's like multiplying by the reciprocal, right?

So, \( c \div(h+4) \) is the same as \( c \times \frac{1}{h+4} \).

Now, if I multiply \( c \) by \( \frac{1}{h+4} \), I get... \( \frac{c}{h+4} \).

Wait, that's option A. But let me check the others just in case.

Option B is \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \), but that's adding 4 to \( c \), which isn't what we want.

Option C is \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \), which looks like it's doing something different... it looks like it's dividing \( c \) by \( h \) and then adding 4, that's not right.

And option D is \( \frac{h+4}{c} \), which is the other way round... no.

So, my answer is... A. Yeah, that's right. 

The final answer is A.
