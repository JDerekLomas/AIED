To find the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \), let's break it down...

## Step 1: Understanding the Calculation
The calculation given is \( c \div(h+4) \). This means we are dividing \( c \) by \( (h+4) \).

## 2: Writing Division in Algebraic Form
In algebra, division can be written as a fraction. So, \( c \div(h+4) \) can be written as \( \frac{c}{h+4} \).

## 3: Comparing with Options
Let's look at the options given:
- A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)
- B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)
- C: \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)
- D: \( \frac{h+4}{c} \)

## 4: Selecting the Correct Option
Option A directly matches what we wrote down in Step 2: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \). 

## 5: Checking for Errors or Other Possible Answers
Let's quickly check if the others could possibly be correct:
- B suggests adding 4 to \( c \) before dividing, which is not what we want.
- C implies dividing \( c \) by \( h \) and then adding 4, which changes the order of operations and doesn't match.
- D flips the numerator and denominator, which is the reciprocal and not what we're looking for.

## 6: Conclusion
Given that Option A matches our algebraic representation of \( c \div(h+4) \) without any alterations to the original expression's intent, it seems to be the correct choice.

The answer is A.
