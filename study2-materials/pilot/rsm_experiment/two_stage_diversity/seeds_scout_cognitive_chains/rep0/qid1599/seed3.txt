To solve this, I need to remember what the division and the brackets mean...

The calculation is \( c \div (h + 4) \).

Okay, so \( h + 4 \) is in brackets, that means I do that first, right?

So, \( h + 4 \) is like... one thing.

Now, I'm dividing \( c \) by that one thing...

\( c \div (h + 4) \) is like... \( c \) over \( h + 4 \), isn't it?

Let me write that down...

\( \frac{c}{h + 4} \)

Hmm, does that look right?

Wait, what was the question again? Oh yeah, which one of these is the same...

A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)

B) \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)

C) \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)

D) \( \frac{h+4}{c} \)

Umm... yeah, I think my answer matches... A.

So, my final answer is... A. 

I'm pretty sure that's right...
