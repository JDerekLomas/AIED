To find the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \), I'll go step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem is asking me to express \( c \div(h+4) \) using the correct algebraic convention. This means I need to know how to properly write division in algebra.

## 2: Recall algebraic conventions
In algebra, division can be shown as a fraction. So, \( c \div(h+4) \) should be written with \( c \) on top and \( (h+4) \) on the bottom.

## 3: Write it down
If \( c \) is divided by \( (h+4) \), it looks like... \( \frac{c}{h+4} \).

## 4: Check the options
Now, let me check the options given:
- A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)
- B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)
- C: \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)
- D: \( \frac{h+4}{c} \)

## 5: Compare with my working
My working is \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which matches option A.

## 6: Double-check for mistakes
Wait, did I do it right? Division in algebra means one thing on top of the other, in a fraction. That looks right... 

## 7: Make a final decision
Looks like A is my answer. I'm pretty sure that's right.

The answer is A.
