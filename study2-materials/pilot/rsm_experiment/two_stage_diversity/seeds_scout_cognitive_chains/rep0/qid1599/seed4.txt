To find the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \), I need to remember what the division sign really means... um... it means...

Okay, so \( c \div(h+4) \) means \( c \) divided by \( h+4 \).

So, if I write it out... \( c \) divided by \( h+4 \)... that looks like...

\( c \) over \( h+4 \)...

Wait, how do I write that in fraction form again?

Oh yeah, it's like... \( \frac{h+4}{c} \) no, wait that's not right... that's \( h+4 \) divided by \( c \), isn't it?

Cross that out... ×

So, it's \( c \) on top and \( h+4 \) on the bottom...

\( \frac{c}{h+4} \)!

Is that right?

Looking at the options...

A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)

B) \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)

C) \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)

D) \( \frac{h+4}{c} \)

My answer is... A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \) I'm pretty sure that's right...
