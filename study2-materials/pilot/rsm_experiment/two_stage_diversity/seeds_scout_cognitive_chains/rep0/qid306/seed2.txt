## Step 1: Read the problems
I have two problems to solve: \( 4-5+6= \) and \( 4+5 \times 6= \). I need to figure out which calculation to do first for each problem.

## 2: Analyze Problem P
For Problem P, \( 4-5+6= \), I think I should do the operations from left to right. So, first, I should do \( 4-5 \) because they are next to each other.

## 3: Analyze Problem Q
For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6= \), I remember that in maths, multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction. So, I should do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 4: Match my analysis to the given options
From my analysis, for Problem P, I should do \( 4-5 \) first, and for Problem Q, I should do \( 5 \times 6 \) first. Let me see if that matches any of the options.

## 5: Review the options
Option A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - No, because Problem Q should be \( 5 \times 6 \) first, not \( 4+5 \).
Option B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Yes, that matches what I think.
Option C: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - No, because for Problem P, I think \( 4-5 \) should be first, and for Problem Q, \( 5 \times 6 \) should be first.
Option D: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - No, because for Problem P, \( 4-5 \) should be first.

## 6: Choose the answer
I'm pretty sure I should choose B.

The best answer is B.
