## Step 1: Understand the problems
I have two problems to solve: \( 4-5+6= \) and \( 4+5 \times 6= \). I need to figure out which calculation to do first for each problem.

## 2: Analyze Problem P
For Problem P, \( 4-5+6= \), I think I should do the operations from left to right. So, first, I should do \( 4-5 \) because they are next to each other.

## 3: Analyze Problem Q
For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6= \), I'm pretty sure we do multiplication before addition. So, I should do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 4: Compare with rules of maths operations
I remember from maths lessons that in expressions, you do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. But for Problem P, there is only addition and subtraction, so I go from left to right. For Problem Q, clearly, \( 5 \times 6 \) should be done first.

## 5: Decide on the calculations to do first
For Problem P, I need to do \( 4-5 \) first because it comes first from the left. For Problem Q, I need to do \( 5 \times 6 \) first because multiplication comes before addition.

## 6: Match to given options
Option A says Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and Problem Q: \( 4+5 \), which doesn't match my reasoning for Problem Q. Option B says Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \), which matches my reasoning. Option C and D don't match my reasoning.

## 7: Conclusion
Based on my understanding, the correct order is to do \( 4-5 \) first in Problem P and \( 5 \times 6 \) first in Problem Q.

The best answer is B.
