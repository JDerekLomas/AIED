Let's have a look at these problems...

## Step 1: Understanding Problem P
Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \). To solve it, I think I need to do the operations in the order they are given... or is it? I remember we do addition and subtraction from left to right, so I should start with \( 4-5 \).

## 2: Understanding Problem Q
Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). For this one, I'm pretty sure we do multiplication before addition. So, I should do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 3: Writing Down the Steps for Each Problem
For Problem P, the first step is \( 4-5 \).
For Problem Q, the first step is \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 4: Matching to the Given Options
Now, let me look at the options...
- A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \). I'm not sure about Problem Q; I think I should do the multiplication first.
- B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \). This looks right to me.
- C and D: I don't think those are correct because for Problem P, I don't think I should start with \( 5+6 \).

## 5: Making a Decision
Based on what I know, for Problem P, I do \( 4-5 \) first, and for Problem Q, I do \( 5 \times 6 \) first. So, the correct sequence is:
Problem P: \( 4-5 \)
Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \)

The best answer is B.
