Let's look at the questions...

## Step 1: Understanding Problem P
Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \). I think I should do the... um... subtraction first? So, \( 4-5 \) and then add 6? Yeah, that sounds right.

## Step 2: Understanding Problem Q
Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). Wait, do I do the addition first or the multiplication? I'm pretty sure it's the multiplication... my teacher told me that multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction... so yeah, \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 3: Writing Down the Order of Operations for Each Problem
For Problem P, I need to do \( 4-5 \) first.
For Problem Q, I need to do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 4: Matching to the Given Options
Now, let's see which option matches what I think:
- Problem P: \( 4-5 \)
- Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \)

## 5: Choosing the Correct Option
Looking at the options:
A) Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - No, that's not right for Q.
B) Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Yeah, that's what I thought.
C) Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - No, that's not right for either.
D) Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - No, that's not right for P.

The best answer is B.
