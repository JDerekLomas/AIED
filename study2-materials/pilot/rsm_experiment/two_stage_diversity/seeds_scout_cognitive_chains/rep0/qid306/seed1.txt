## Step 1: Understand the problems
I have two problems to solve: Problem P is \( 4-5+6 \) and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6 \).

## 2: Decide on the order of operations for Problem P
For Problem P, \( 4-5+6 \), I think I just do it from left to right... so first I do \( 4-5 \) and then add 6. Yeah, that sounds right.

## 3: Decide on the order of operations for Problem Q
For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \times 6 \), I'm pretty sure we do multiplication before addition. So, I should do \( 5 \times 6 \) first and then add 4.

## 4: Identify the correct order for each problem
From my understanding, for Problem P, I should do \( 4-5 \) first. For Problem Q, I should do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 5: Match my understanding to the given options
Option A says Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and Problem Q: \( 4+5 \), which doesn't match my reasoning for Problem Q. Option B says Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \), which matches what I think. Option C and D don't match my reasoning.

## 6: Choose the correct answer
Based on my steps, the correct calculations to do first are \( 4-5 \) for Problem P and \( 5 \times 6 \) for Problem Q.

The best answer is B.
