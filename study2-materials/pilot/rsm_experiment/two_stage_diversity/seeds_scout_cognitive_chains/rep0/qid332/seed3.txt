## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem is to solve the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) and determine if Tom or Katie's suggested next line of working is correct.

## 2: Write down the given equation
\(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\)

## 3: Consider Tom's suggestion
Tom says a correct next line could be \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). Let's see if this is correct by isolating \(\frac{x}{3}\) in the original equation.

## 4: Check Tom's suggestion
To isolate \(\frac{x}{3}\), I add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\(\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5\)
Which simplifies to:
\(\frac{x}{3} = 17\)
So, Tom seems correct.

## 5: Consider Katie's suggestion
Katie says a correct next line could be \(x - 5 = 36\). Let's check this by multiplying every term in the original equation by 3 to clear the fraction:
\(3 \times \frac{x}{3} - 3 \times 5 = 3 \times 12\)
This simplifies to:
\(x - 15 = 36\)

## 6: Compare Katie's suggestion to her actual result
Katie suggested \(x - 5 = 36\), but when I did it, I got \(x - 15 = 36\). This means Katie's suggestion is incorrect because she wrote \(-5\) instead of \(-15\).

## 7: Determine who is correct
From step 4, Tom is correct. From step 6, Katie is incorrect. So, only Tom is correct.

The best answer is A.
