## Step 1: Understand the problem and what is being asked
The problem provides an equation: \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \), and two possible next steps in solving it, one by Tom and one by Katie. We need to determine if either, both, or neither of their suggested next steps is correct.

## 2: Analyze Tom's suggestion
Tom suggests that a correct next line of working could be \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). To verify this, let's see if it logically follows from the given equation. If we add 5 to both sides of the equation \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \), we get \( \frac{x}{3} = 12 + 5 \), which simplifies to \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). This matches Tom's suggestion.

## 3: Analyze Katie's suggestion
Katie suggests that a correct next line of working could be \( x - 5 = 36 \). To verify this, let's manipulate the original equation: \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \). If we multiply every term by 3 to clear the fraction, we get \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \). It seems Katie's suggestion might be incorrect based on this initial observation.

## 4: Detailed check of Katie's suggestion
Let's double-check Katie's step with the correct process: Starting with \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \), if we multiply every term by 3, we indeed get \( x - 15 = 36 \). Katie's suggestion was \( x - 5 = 36 \), which does not match the correct manipulation of the equation.

## 5: Conclusion
From the steps above, Tom's suggestion (\( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \)) is correct because it directly follows from adding 5 to both sides of the equation. Katie's suggestion (\( x - 5 = 36 \)) is incorrect because multiplying both sides of the original equation by 3 yields \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \).

## 6: Choose the correct answer
Given that only Tom's suggestion is correct, the answer must reflect this.

The best answer is A.
