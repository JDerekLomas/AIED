## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem is to solve the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) and determine if Tom or Katie's suggested next line of working is correct.

## 2: Recall how to solve equations
To solve for \(x\), we need to isolate \(x\) on one side of the equation. This usually involves getting rid of the constants on the same side as \(x\) first.

## 3: Evaluate Tom's suggestion
Tom says a correct next line of working could be \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). Let's see if this is correct by checking if it logically follows from the original equation.

## 4: Check Tom's suggestion
If we add 5 to both sides of the original equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\), we get:
\(\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5\)
which simplifies to:
\(\frac{x}{3} = 17\)
So, Tom's suggestion seems correct.

## 5: Evaluate Katie's suggestion
Katie says a correct next line of working could be \(x - 5 = 36\). Let's check this.

## 6: Check Katie's suggestion
To see if Katie's suggestion is correct, let's manipulate the original equation:
\(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\)
If we multiply every term by 3 to clear the fraction:
\(x - 15 = 36\)
Not \(x - 5 = 36\), so Katie's suggestion seems incorrect based on this direct manipulation.

## 7: Confirm Katie's mistake
Katie's \(x - 5 = 36\) would imply:
\(x = 36 + 5\)
\(x = 41\)
Let's check if this \(x\) satisfies the original equation:
\(\frac{41}{3} - 5 = 13.67 - 5 = 8.67 \neq 12\)
So, Katie's suggestion does not lead to a correct solution.

## 8: Conclusion
Tom's suggestion (\(\frac{x}{3} = 17\)) is correct because it follows directly from adding 5 to both sides of the equation. Katie's suggestion (\(x - 5 = 36\)) is incorrect because multiplying by 3 would give \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\).

## 9: Choose the correct answer
Given Tom is correct and Katie is not, the answer must reflect that only Tom is correct.

The best answer is A.
