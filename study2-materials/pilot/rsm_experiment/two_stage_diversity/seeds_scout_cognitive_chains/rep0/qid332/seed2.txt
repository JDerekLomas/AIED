## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the task
The equation given is \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \). We need to determine if Tom's or Katie's next line of working is correct.

## 2: Analyze Tom's suggestion
Tom says a correct next line of working could be \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). To check this, let's see if adding 5 to both sides of the original equation would get us to Tom's line.
So, \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5 \), which simplifies to \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). This seems correct.

## 3: Analyze Katie's suggestion
Katie says a correct next line of working could be \( x - 5 = 36 \). Let's check if multiplying both sides of the original equation by 3 would get us to Katie's line.
The original equation is \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \). Multiplying every term by 3 gives \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \). So, Katie's suggestion seems incorrect.

## 4: Double-check the analysis
Just to make sure, let's re-examine Katie's suggestion more closely. If we multiply the entire original equation by 3, we get:
\( \frac{x}{3} \times 3 - 5 \times 3 = 12 \times 3 \)
Which simplifies to:
\( x - 15 = 36 \)
This confirms that Katie's \( x - 5 = 36 \) is not correct.

## 5: Conclusion
From the analysis, Tom's suggestion \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \) is correct because it directly follows from adding 5 to both sides of the original equation. Katie's suggestion \( x - 5 = 36 \) is incorrect because it doesn't properly derive from the original equation; the correct derivation would yield \( x - 15 = 36 \).

## 6: Choose the correct answer
Since only Tom is correct, the answer must reflect that.

The best answer is A.
