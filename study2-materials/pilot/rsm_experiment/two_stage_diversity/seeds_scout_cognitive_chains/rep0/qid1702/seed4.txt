## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \(10x - 6y = 30\).

## Step 2: Identify the given values
We are given \(y = 0.5\), and we need to find \(x\).

## 3: Substitute \(y\) into the equation
Substituting \(y = 0.5\) into the equation gives us \(10x - 6(0.5) = 30\).

## 4: Perform the substitution
This becomes \(10x - 3 = 30\).

## 5: Add 3 to both sides
Adding 3 to both sides gives \(10x = 33\).

## 6: Divide by 10
Dividing both sides by 10 gives \(x = 3.3\).

## 7: Check the answer choices
Looking at the answer choices: A) \(4.25\), B) \(-4.25\), C) \(3.3\), D) \(2.7\), I think I got it right... yeah, it looks like C) \(3.3\).

The best answer is C.
