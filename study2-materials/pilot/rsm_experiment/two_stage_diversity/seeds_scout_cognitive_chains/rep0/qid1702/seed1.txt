## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \(10x - 6y = 30\).

## Step 2: Identify the given values
We are given \(y = 0.5\) and we need to find \(x\).

## 3: Substitute \(y\) into the equation
Substituting \(y = 0.5\) into the equation gives \(10x - 6(0.5) = 30\).

## 4: Simplify the equation
Simplifying, we get \(10x - 3 = 30\).

## 5: Add 3 to both sides
Adding 3 to both sides gives \(10x = 33\).

## 6: Divide by 10 to solve for \(x\)
Dividing both sides by 10 gives \(x = 3.3\).

## 7: Check the answer choices
The possible answers are A: \(4.25\), B: \(-4.25\), C: \(3.3\), D: \(2.7\). My calculation matches option C.

The best answer is C.
