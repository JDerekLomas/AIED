## Step 1: Understand the equation and the table of values
The equation given is $10x - 6y = 30$. We need to find the value of $x$ when $y = 0.5$.

## 2: Substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation
Substituting $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$, we get $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$.

## 3: Perform the arithmetic
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$ simplifies to $10x - 3 = 30$.

## 4: Solve for $x$
Adding 3 to both sides gives $10x = 33$.

## 5: Continue solving for $x$
Dividing both sides by 10 gives $x = 3.3$.

## 6: Review the calculation for errors
Checking my calculation: $10x = 33$, so $x = 33 / 10 = 3.3$. Yeah, that looks right.

## 7: Choose the correct answer
So, the value that should replace the star is $3.3$. That's option C.

The best answer is C.
