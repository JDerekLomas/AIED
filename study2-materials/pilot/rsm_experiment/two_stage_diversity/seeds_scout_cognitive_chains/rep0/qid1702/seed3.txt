## Step 1: Write down the given equation and the table of values.
The equation given is \(10x - 6y = 30\), and the table of values is:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline\( x \) & \( \bigstar \) \\
\hline\( y \) & \( 0.5 \) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

## 2: Substitute \( y = 0.5 \) into the equation to find \( x \).
To find \( x \), I will substitute \( y = 0.5 \) into the equation:
\(10x - 6(0.5) = 30\)

## 3: Solve for \( x \).
First, calculate \(6(0.5)\):
\(6(0.5) = 3\)
So the equation becomes:
\(10x - 3 = 30\)

## 4: Isolate \( x \).
Add 3 to both sides:
\(10x = 30 + 3\)
\(10x = 33\)

## 5: Solve for \( x \).
Divide both sides by 10:
\(x = \frac{33}{10}\)
\(x = 3.3\)

## 6: Choose the correct answer.
From the calculation, \(x = 3.3\), so the star should be replaced by \(3.3\).

The best answer is C.
