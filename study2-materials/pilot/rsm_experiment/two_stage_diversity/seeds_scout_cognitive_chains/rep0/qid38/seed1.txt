To write this as a single fraction as simply as possible...

First, I need to get a common denominator for both fractions. So, the denominators are \(2x\) and \(x\). The common denominator would be... \(2x\), yeah.

So, I'm going to convert \(\frac{4}{x}\) into a fraction with the denominator \(2x\). To do that, I multiply the top and bottom by 2...

\(\frac{4}{x} = \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{8}{2x}\)

So now I have:
\(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}\)

These have the same denominator, so I can just add the numerators...

\(\frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}\)

Hmm, that looks right, doesn't it? I didn't do much to the second fraction, just... multiplied it by 2 on top and bottom. And then added them. So, that's...

The answer is A) \(\frac{11}{2x}\).
