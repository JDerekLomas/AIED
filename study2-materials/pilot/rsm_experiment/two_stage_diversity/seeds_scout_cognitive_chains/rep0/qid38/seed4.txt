## Step 1: Identify the fractions to be added
The problem requires adding two fractions: \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\).

## 2: Find a common denominator
To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are \(2x\) and \(x\), so the common denominator would be \(2x\) because \(2x\) can divide by both \(2x\) and \(x\).

## 3: Convert fractions to have the common denominator
I'll convert \(\frac{4}{x}\) to have a denominator of \(2x\). To do this, I multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2, which gives \(\frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{8}{2x}\).

## 4: Add the fractions
Now that both fractions have the same denominator, I can add them: \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}\).

## 5: Simplify if possible
The fraction \(\frac{11}{2x}\) cannot be simplified further because 11 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with \(2x\).

## 6: Choose the correct answer
Comparing my result \(\frac{11}{2x}\) to the options provided:
- A: \(\frac{11}{2x}\) matches my result.
- B: \(\frac{7}{3x}\) does not match.
- C: \(\frac{11}{x}\) does not match because the denominator is \(x\), not \(2x\).
- D: \(\frac{7}{2x}\) does not match because the numerator is 7, not 11.

The best answer is A.
