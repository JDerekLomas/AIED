.. I think I need to find a common denominator or something.

So, I've got \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\).

Hmm... how do I make the denominators the same? I'm going to change \(\frac{4}{x}\) to have a denominator of \(2x\), like this:

\(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2}\) = \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}\)

 Wait, is that right? *checks* Yeah, that looks good.

Now, I can just add them:

\(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}\).

*pauses* I think that's it. I've got \(\frac{11}{2x}\).

Unless... I don't know, it seems too easy. *thinks for a moment* No, I'm going to go with it.

The answer is... A) \(\frac{11}{2x}\). Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's right.
