To write \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\) as a single fraction, I need to get the denominators the same.

First, I'll write it out: \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\)

Hmm... to get the denominators the same, I think I need to multiply the second fraction by... 2. Yeah, that way I'll get \(2x\) as the denominator for both.

So, \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2}\) = \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}\)

 Crossing out the old working... no, wait, I'll keep it.

Okay, now I add them: \(\frac{3 + 8}{2x}\) = \(\frac{11}{2x}\)

I think that's it... Let me check the answers.

## Step 1: Reviewing the options
I have \(\frac{11}{2x}\) and the options are: 
A: \(\frac{11}{2x}\)
B: \(\frac{7}{3x}\)
C: \(\frac{11}{x}\)
D: \(\frac{7}{2x}\)

## 2: Making the final choice
My working shows \(\frac{11}{2x}\), which matches option A.

The best answer is A.
