To solve the equation \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\), I need to get \(p\) on its own.

First, I'll multiply both sides by \(p\) to get rid of the fraction... I think.

So, \(10p = 5\).

Wait, no... that's not right. If I multiply both sides by \(p\), I get \(10p = 5\).

Let me try that again. If \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\), then I'll multiply both sides by \(p\)...

\(10p = 5\)

Hmm, now I need to divide both sides by 10 to get \(p\) on its own.

So, \(p = \frac{5}{10}\).

\(p = 0.5\)

Let me check that... \(10 = \frac{5}{0.5}\)... yeah, that's right because \(5 \div 0.5 = 10\).

So, my answer is... A) \(p = 0.5\).

I'm pretty sure that's right... yeah, A.
