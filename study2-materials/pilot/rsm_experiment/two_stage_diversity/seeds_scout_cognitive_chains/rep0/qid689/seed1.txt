To solve the equation... um... \(10=\frac{5}{p}\).

First, I need to get rid of the fraction. So, I'll... multiply both sides by \(p\). 

\(10p = 5\)

Wait, that doesn't feel right... let me check. If I multiply the right side by \(p\), I get \(5p\) on the right, no, that's not it... I mean, I just multiply by \(p\)...

So, \(10p = 5\).

Now, I divide both sides by 10...

\(p = \frac{5}{10}\)

\(p = 0.5\)

Hmm... or is it... 

\(10 = \frac{5}{p}\)

If I multiply both sides by \(p\), I get...

\(10p = 5\)

Now, divide both sides by 10...

\(p = \frac{5}{10}\)

Which is \(0.5\). Yeah, that's it. 

But, is \(0.5\) the same as... uh... \(50\)? No, that's not it... 

I'm pretty sure it's \(0.5\). 

Oh, and there's a \(0.5\) in the answers... 

The final answer is: \(\boxed{A}\)
