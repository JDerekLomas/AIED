To solve the equation \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\), I first need to get rid of the fraction. I think I can do that by... um... multiplying both sides by \(p\). Yeah, that sounds right.

So, I have:
\[10 = \frac{5}{p}\]

Multiplying both sides by \(p\), I get:
\[10p = 5\] 

Wait, no... that's not right. If I multiply the 10 by \(p\), I get \(10p\), but if I multiply \(\frac{5}{p}\) by \(p\), the \(p\)s cancel out, leaving just 5. So, I have:

\[10p = 5\]

Dividing both sides by 10 to solve for \(p\):

\[p = \frac{5}{10}\]

\[p = 0.5\]

Hmm, I think that's right. Or is it? Let me check... 

Crossing out \(p = 0.5\), I'm not sure... 

Let me redo it. If \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\), then to get rid of the fraction:

I multiply both sides by \(p\):
\[10p = 5\]

Then I divide both sides by 10 (but what if I divide by 5 instead?):

No, wait. Dividing by 10:

\[p = \frac{5}{10}\]

\[p = 0.5\]

But A says \(p = 0.5\)... and B says \(p = 50\)... 

If \(p = 50\), then \(\frac{5}{50} = 0.1\), not 10. So that's wrong.

Uh-huh, my first answer was \(p = 0.5\). That's... that's option A.

The answer is A.
