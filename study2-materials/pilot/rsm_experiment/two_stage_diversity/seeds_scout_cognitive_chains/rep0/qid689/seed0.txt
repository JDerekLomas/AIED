First, I'm gonna get rid of the fraction... um... I think I need to multiply both sides by \(p\), yeah?

So, I get:
\[
10p = 5
\]

 Wait, no... that's not right... I mean, I multiply both sides by \(p\) to get rid of the denominator:

\[
10 = \frac{5}{p}
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(p\):

\[
10p = 5
\]

Now, I need to get \(p\) on its own... divide both sides by 10, I think:

\[
p = \frac{5}{10}
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
p = 0.5
\]

Hold on, I think I remember doing a question like this before... or was it \(p = \frac{1}{2}\)? Nah, that's the same as 0.5... right?

So, my answer is... A) \(p = 0.5\).

I'm pretty sure that's right... *crosses out and checks work*... yeah, looks good to me.

The answer is A.
