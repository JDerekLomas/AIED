## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\).

## Step 2: Try to isolate \(p\)
To isolate \(p\), I need to get rid of the fraction. I think I can do that by multiplying both sides by \(p\), yeah?

## 3: Multiply both sides by \(p\)
Multiplying both sides by \(p\) gives \(10p = 5\).

## 4: Solve for \(p\)
Now, I need to solve for \(p\). I think I'll divide both sides by 10 to get \(p\) by itself. So, \(p = \frac{5}{10}\).

## 5: Simplify the fraction
Simplifying the fraction \(\frac{5}{10}\) gives \(p = 0.5\).

## 6: Check the answer choices
Looking at the answer choices, I see \(p = 0.5\), which matches my calculation.

## 7: Confirm the solution
Wait, did I do that right? Multiplying by \(p\) and then dividing by 10 seems right. Yeah, I'm pretty sure \(p = 0.5\) is correct.

The best answer is A.
