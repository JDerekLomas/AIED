To solve for \( p \), I need to get \( p \) on its own. The equation is:

\[
3p = \frac{1}{12}
\]

First, I'll divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( p \).

\[
p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3
\]

Hmm, dividing by 3... that's the same as multiplying by... uh... \(\frac{1}{3}\)?

So,

\[
p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let me write that out...

\[
p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 1}{12 \times 3} = \frac{1}{36}
\]

Wait, did I do that right? Multiplying the denominators... yeah, that seems right.

Okay, so \( p = \frac{1}{36} \).

I'm pretty sure that's right... *crosses out previous line and then re-writes it just to make sure*.

The answer is B.
