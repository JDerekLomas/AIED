## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\).

## Step 2: Try to isolate \(p\)
To isolate \(p\), I need to get \(p\) on its own. I think I need to divide both sides by 3. So, I'll do that.

## 3: Divide both sides by 3
Dividing both sides by 3 gives me \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\).

## 4: Perform the division
I'm not sure how to do \(\frac{1}{12} \div 3\). Is it \(\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}\)? I think so... That would be \(\frac{1}{36}\).

## 5: Check my work
Let me check if \(\frac{1}{36}\) is right. If \(p = \frac{1}{36}\), then \(3p = 3 \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12}\). Yeah, that looks right.

## 6: Choose my answer
So, \(p = \frac{1}{36}\). That matches option B.

The best answer is B.
