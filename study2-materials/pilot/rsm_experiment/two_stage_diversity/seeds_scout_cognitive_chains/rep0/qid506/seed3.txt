## Step 1: Write down the given equation
The equation given is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\).

## Step 2: Try to isolate \(p\)
To isolate \(p\), I need to get \(p\) on its own. I think I need to divide both sides by 3. So, it will be \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3\).

## 3: Perform the division
To divide by 3, I can multiply by the reciprocal of 3, which is \(\frac{1}{3}\). So, \(p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}\).

## 4: Multiply the fractions
Multiplying the numerators and the denominators gives \(p = \frac{1 \times 1}{12 \times 3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 5: Check the answer choices
Looking at the answer choices: A) \(p = \frac{1}{4}\), B) \(p = \frac{1}{36}\), C) \(p = 4\), D) \(p = \frac{1}{9}\). My answer matches B) \(p = \frac{1}{36}\).

The best answer is B.
