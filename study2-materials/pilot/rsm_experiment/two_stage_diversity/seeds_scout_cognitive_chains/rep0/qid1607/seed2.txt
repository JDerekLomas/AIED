## Step 1: Understand the given equation and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). Isaac's steps are:
Step 1: \( 60 = 1 + k \)
Step 2: \( 61 = k \)

## 2: Solve the equation to verify Isaac's steps
To solve \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \), first multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator:
\( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \)
\( 60 = 1 + k \)

## 3: Continue solving for \( k \)
Now, subtract 1 from both sides to solve for \( k \):
\( 60 - 1 = k \)
\( 59 = k \)

## 4: Evaluate Isaac's steps
Isaac's Step 1: \( 60 = 1 + k \) seems correct based on my calculation in Step 2.
However, his Step 2: \( 61 = k \) is incorrect because I found \( k = 59 \), not 61.

## 5: Determine the correctness of Isaac's steps
Since Step 1 matches my calculation but Step 2 does not, we need to assess if only Step 1 is correct.

## 6: Choose the correct answer
Given that Step 1 is correct (\( 60 = 1 + k \)) but Step 2 is incorrect (\( 61 = k \) should be \( 59 = k \)), the correct answer is that only Step 1 is correct.

The best answer is A.
