## Step 1: Understand the given equation and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \). Isaac's steps are:
Step \( 1: \) \( 60=1+k \)
Step \( 2: \) \( 61=k \)

## 2: Verify Isaac's steps
To verify Isaac's steps, let's solve the equation properly.
First, multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator: \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \)
This simplifies to: \( 60 = 1 + k \)

## 3: Check Step 1
Isaac's Step 1 is \( 60=1+k \). This matches our calculation, so Step 1 seems correct.

## 4: Solve for k
Now, solve for \( k \): \( 60 = 1 + k \)
Subtract 1 from both sides: \( 60 - 1 = k \)
So, \( k = 59 \)

## 5: Check Step 2
Isaac's Step 2 is \( 61=k \). This does not match our calculation of \( k = 59 \), so Step 2 is incorrect.

## 6: Determine the correctness of Isaac's steps
Since Step 1 is correct and Step 2 is incorrect, we need to choose the answer that reflects this.

The best answer is A.
