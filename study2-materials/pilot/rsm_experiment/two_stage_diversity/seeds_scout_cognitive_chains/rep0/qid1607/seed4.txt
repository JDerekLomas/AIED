## Step 1: Understand the given equation and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \). Isaac's steps are:
Step \( 1: \) \( 60=1+k \)
Step \( 2: \) \( 61=k \)

## 2: Verify Isaac's steps
To verify Isaac's steps, let's solve the equation properly.
First, we multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction: \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \)
This simplifies to: \( 60 = 1 + k \)

## 3: Compare with Isaac's Step 1
Isaac's Step 1 is \( 60=1+k \), which matches our calculation. So, Isaac's Step 1 seems correct.

## 4: Solve for \( k \) and compare with Isaac's Step 2
Now, we solve for \( k \): \( 60 = 1 + k \)
Subtract 1 from both sides: \( 60 - 1 = k \)
This simplifies to: \( 59 = k \)

## 5: Evaluate Isaac's Step 2
Isaac's Step 2 is \( 61=k \), which does not match our calculation of \( k = 59 \). So, Isaac's Step 2 is incorrect.

## 6: Determine the correctness of Isaac's steps
Since Step 1 is correct and Step 2 is incorrect, we need to choose the option that reflects this.

## 7: Choose the correct answer
Given that only Step 1 is correct, the answer is A) Only step \( 1 \).

The best answer is A.
