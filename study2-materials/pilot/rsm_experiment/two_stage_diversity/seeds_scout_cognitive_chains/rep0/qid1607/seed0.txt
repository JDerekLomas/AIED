## Step 1: Understand the given equation and Isaac's steps.
The equation given is \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \). Isaac's steps are:
Step \( 1: \) \( 60=1+k \)
Step \( 2: \) \( 61=k \)

## 2: Verify Isaac's Step 1.
To verify Step 1, we multiply both sides of the original equation by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
\( 15 \times 4 = \frac{1+k}{4} \times 4 \)
This simplifies to:
\( 60 = 1 + k \)
So, Isaac's Step 1 seems correct.

## 3: Verify Isaac's Step 2.
For Step 2, Isaac subtracts 1 from both sides of the equation \( 60 = 1 + k \) to solve for \( k \):
\( 60 - 1 = 1 + k - 1 \)
This simplifies to:
\( 59 = k \)
Not \( 61 = k \) as Isaac wrote.

## 4: Evaluate Isaac's steps.
Given the verification:
- Step 1 is correct because \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) and \( \frac{1+k}{4} \times 4 = 1 + k \).
- Step 2 is incorrect because \( k = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 5: Choose the correct answer based on the evaluation of Isaac's steps.
Since only Step 1 is correct and Step 2 is incorrect:
The correct answer is A.
