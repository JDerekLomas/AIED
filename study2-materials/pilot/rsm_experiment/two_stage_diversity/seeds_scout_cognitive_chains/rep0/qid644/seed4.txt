## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply the two terms pointed to by the arrows, which are -1 from the first bracket and -4 from the second bracket.

## 2: Multiply the terms
To multiply them, I do -1 * -4. I'm not really sure if I should be adding or multiplying, but I think it's multiplication because that's what you're supposed to do when you see two numbers or terms together like that.

## 3: Perform the multiplication
-1 * -4 = 4, I think. Wait, is it -1 * -4 = -5? No, that can't be right... If you multiply two negatives, you get a positive, right? So, -1 * -4 = 4.

## 4: Choose the correct answer
So, the answer must be positive 4. Let me look at the choices... A) +4, B) -4, C) +5, D) -5. Yeah, A is the one that matches.

The best answer is A.
