To find out what Molly should get when she multiplies the two terms indicated by the arrows, I need to multiply \(-1\) by \(-4\).

So, it's \( -1 \times -4 \)... um...

## Step 1: Multiply -1 by -4
When you multiply a negative by a negative, you get a positive, right? So, \( -1 \times -4 = 4 \).

## 2: Write down the answer
That means the answer is \( +4 \).

## 3: Choose the correct option
Looking at the options provided:
- A: \( +4 \)
- B: \( -4 \)
- C: \( +5 \)
- D: \( -5 \)

My answer matches option A.

The best answer is A.
