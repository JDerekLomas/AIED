## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\). The arrows are pointing at \(-1\) and \(-4\).

## 2: Multiply the terms
To find the product of \(-1\) and \(-4\), I recall that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result. So, \(-1 \times -4 = 4\).

## 3: Write down the calculation
\(-1 \times -4 = 4\). I'm pretty sure that's right because two negatives make a positive.

## 4: Choose the answer
Looking at the options provided: A) \( +4 \), B) \( -4 \), C) \( +5 \), D) \( -5 \). My calculation matches option A.

The best answer is A.
