## Step 1: Write down the question
The question is to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\)

## Step 2: Try to recall the method for multiplying out brackets
I think we're supposed to use the FOIL method or something? That's what my teacher told me. FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. So, I multiply the first terms in each bracket, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, and finally the last terms in each bracket.

## 3: Apply the FOIL method
First: \(m \times m = m^2\)

## 4: Continue with the FOIL method
Outer: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)

## 5: Continue with the FOIL method
Inner: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)

## 6: Finish the FOIL method
Last: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)

## 7: Put it all together
So, it looks like: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\)

## 8: Simplify the expression
Wait, do I add or subtract the \(m\) terms? I think I add the \(-7m\) and \(-5m\)... no, that can't be right. I mean, I multiply and add, but then I have to combine like terms. \(-7m - 5m = -12m\), I'm pretty sure.

## 9: Write down the simplified expression
So, that gives me: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\)

## 10: Check the answer
Let me see... I think that's right. I'm going to check by multiplying the brackets again just to make sure, but I'm pretty confident.

## 11: Final check and choose an answer
After checking, yeah, I'm sure: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\). That matches option B.

The best answer is B.
