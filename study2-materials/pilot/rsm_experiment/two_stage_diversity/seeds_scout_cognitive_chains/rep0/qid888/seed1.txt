## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem asks me to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\).

## Step 2: Recall the method for multiplying out brackets
I think we're supposed to use the FOIL method or something. FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. So, I multiply the first terms in each bracket, then the outer, then the inner, and finally the last terms.

## 3: Apply the FOIL method
Using FOIL:
- First: \(m \times m = m^2\)
- Outer: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
- Inner: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
- Last: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)

## 4: Combine the terms
Now, I add these together: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\).

## 5: Simplify the expression
Combining like terms: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 6: Check my work
Let me check if I made any mistakes... I think I got it right. But, just to be sure, I'll look at the answer choices.

## 7: Compare with answer choices
Comparing my answer \(m^2 - 12m + 35\) with the options:
- A: \(m^2 - 2m - 35\)
- B: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\)
- C: \(m^2 + 12m + 35\)
- D: \(m^2 - 12m - 35\)

My answer matches option B.

The best answer is B.
