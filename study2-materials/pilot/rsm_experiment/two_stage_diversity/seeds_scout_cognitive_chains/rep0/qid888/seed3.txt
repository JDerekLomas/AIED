## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). I'm not really sure how to do this, but I think I've done something like it before.

## 2: Recall the method
Um, I think it's something like... you multiply the first bit of the first bracket by the first bit of the second bracket, then the first bit of the first bracket by the second bit of the second bracket, then the second bit of the first bracket by the first bit of the second bracket, and finally the second bit of the first bracket by the second bit of the second bracket. Yeah, that's right!

## 3: Apply the method
So, I do \(m \times m\), which is \(m^2\), then \(m \times -7\), which is \(-7m\), then \(-5 \times m\), which is \(-5m\), and finally \(-5 \times -7\), which is \(35\). I'm pretty sure that's right.

## 4: Write down the steps
\(m \times m = m^2\)

\(m \times -7 = -7m\)

\(-5 \times m = -5m\)

\(-5 \times -7 = 35\)

## 5: Combine like terms
Now I add them all together: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\). I think I can simplify that. Let me see... \(-7m - 5m\) is \(-12m\), so it becomes \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 6: Check the work
Wait, did I do that right? \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\) yeah, that looks right. And \(-7m - 5m = -12m\), and then \(35\) is positive because it's \(-5 \times -7\). So, yeah, I'm pretty sure that's correct.

## 7: Choose the answer
So, my answer is \(m^2 - 12m + 35\), which is... B.

The best answer is B.
