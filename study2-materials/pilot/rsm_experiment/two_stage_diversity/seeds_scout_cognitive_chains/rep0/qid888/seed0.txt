## Step 1: Write down the expression given in the question
The expression to multiply out is: \((m-5)(m-7)\)

## 2: Apply the FOIL method (or similar) to expand the brackets
To expand this, I'll use the FOIL method. FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. So, I multiply the first terms in each bracket, then the outer, then the inner, and finally the last terms.

## 3: Multiply the terms
- First: \(m \times m = m^2\)
- Outer: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
- Inner: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
- Last: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)

## 4: Combine like terms
Now, I add these together: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\)

## 5: Simplify by combining like terms
Combining the \(m\) terms: \(-7m - 5m = -12m\)

## 6: Write the simplified expression
So, the expression simplifies to: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\)

## 7: Check the answer choices
Looking at the options:
A) \(m^{2}-2 m-35\)
B) \(m^{2}-12 m+35\)
C) \(m^{2}+12 m+35\)
D) \(m^{2}-12 m-35\)

## 8: Choose the correct answer
My working shows the answer should be \(m^{2}-12 m+35\), which matches option B.

The best answer is B.
