## Step 1: Understand the task
I need to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\).

## 2: Recall the method for multiplying out brackets
I'm supposed to use the FOIL method, I think. FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. So, I multiply the first terms in each bracket, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, and finally the last terms in each bracket.

## 3: Apply the FOIL method
Okay, so for \((m-5)(m-7)\):
- First: \(m \times m = m^2\)
- Outer: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
- Inner: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
- Last: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)

## 4: Combine like terms
Now, I add them all together: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\).

## 5: Simplify
Combine the \(m\) terms: \(-7m - 5m = -12m\). So, it simplifies to \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 6: Check the answer
Let me look at the options:
- A: \(m^2 - 2m - 35\)
- B: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\)
- C: \(m^2 + 12m + 35\)
- D: \(m^2 - 12m - 35\)

## 7: Choose the correct answer
My working out seems right, so I think the answer is B: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

The best answer is B.
