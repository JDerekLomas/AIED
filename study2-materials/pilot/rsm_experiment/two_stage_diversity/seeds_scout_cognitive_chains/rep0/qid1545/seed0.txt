## Step 1: First, let's look at the equation and try to understand what it's asking for.
The equation given is \(8+12 \div 4 \square(8+12) \div 4\). We need to find out which symbol (\(>, <, =, \geq\)) belongs in the box.

## 2: Next, I think we need to follow the order of operations, which is BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction).
So, for the left side of the equation, \(8+12 \div 4\), I should do the division first. That means \(12 \div 4 = 3\).

## 3: Now, let's calculate the left side of the equation.
So, it becomes \(8 + 3 = 11\).

## 4: Then, let's calculate the right side of the equation, \((8+12) \div 4\).
First, I do the operation in the brackets: \(8 + 12 = 20\).

## 5: Now, I divide the result by 4.
So, \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 6: Now that I have both sides calculated, let's compare them.
The left side is \(11\) and the right side is \(5\).

## 7: Comparing the two results to decide which symbol goes in the box.
Since \(11 > 5\), the symbol that belongs in the box is \(>\).

## 8: Choosing the correct answer based on the comparison.
From the options given, \(A) >\) matches my comparison.

The best answer is A.
