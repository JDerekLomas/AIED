## Step 1: First, let's write down the expressions given
We have \(8 + 12 \div 4\) and \((8 + 12) \div 4\). I need to work out what they both equal.

## 2: Work out \(8 + 12 \div 4\)
To do this, I think we need to follow the order of operations, which is BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction). So, we do the division first: \(12 \div 4 = 3\). Then, we add 8: \(8 + 3 = 11\).

## 3: Work out \((8 + 12) \div 4\)
First, we do the calculation inside the brackets: \(8 + 12 = 20\). Then, we divide by 4: \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 4: Compare the results
So, \(8 + 12 \div 4 = 11\) and \((8 + 12) \div 4 = 5\). Now, let's compare them: \(11 \square 5\).

## 5: Decide which symbol goes in the box
Since \(11\) is greater than \(5\), the symbol that goes in the box is \(>\).

## 6: Choose the correct answer from the options
The options are \(A) >\), \(B) <\), \(C) =\), \(D) \geq\). Since \(11 > 5\), the answer is \(A) >\).

The best answer is A.
