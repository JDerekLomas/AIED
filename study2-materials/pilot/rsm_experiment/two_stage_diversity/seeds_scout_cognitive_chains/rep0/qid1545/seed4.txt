## Step 1: First, let's write down the expressions given in the question.
The expressions are \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\).

##  2: Next, I need to solve them using the order of operations (BODMAS/BPEDMAS - Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction).
For the first expression: \(8 + 12 \div 4\). According to BODMAS, I do division first. So, \(12 \div 4 = 3\). Then, \(8 + 3 = 11\).

## 3: Now, let's solve the second expression.
For the second expression: \((8+12) \div 4\). First, I do the operation in the brackets: \(8 + 12 = 20\). Then, \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 4: Compare the results of both expressions to determine which symbol belongs in the box.
The first expression equals 11 and the second expression equals 5. So, \(11 \square 5\).

## 5: Decide which symbol to choose based on the comparison.
Since \(11\) is greater than \(5\), the correct symbol is \(>\).

## 6: Choose the correct answer from the options provided.
Given that \(11 > 5\), the answer is A) \(>\).

The best answer is A.
