## Step 1: First, let's write down the given problem.
The problem is: \[ 8+12 \div 4 \square(8+12) \div 4 \]
We need to figure out which symbol goes in the box.

## 2: I think we need to follow the order of operations, BODMAS or something.
BODMAS stands for Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. So, for the left side, \(8+12 \div 4\), we should do the division first.

## 3: Calculate \(12 \div 4\).
\(12 \div 4 = 3\).

## 4: Now, add 8 and the result of the division.
So, \(8 + 3 = 11\).

## 5: Okay, now let's do the right side of the equation, \((8+12) \div 4\).
First, we do the stuff in the brackets: \(8 + 12 = 20\).

## 6: Then divide the result by 4.
\(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 7: Compare the two results.
The left side equals 11 and the right side equals 5. So, \(11 \square 5\).

## 8: Decide which symbol fits.
Since 11 is greater than 5, the symbol must be \(>\).

## 9: Choose the correct answer from the options given.
The options are \(A) >\), \(B) <\), \(C) =\), \(D) \geq\). Since 11 is greater than 5, but not equal to or greater than or equal to in a way that includes equality unnecessarily, the best answer seems to be \(A) >\).

The best answer is A.
