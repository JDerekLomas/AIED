## Step 1: First, let's write down the expressions given
We have two expressions: \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\).

## Step 2: Solve the first expression using the order of operations
For \(8+12 \div 4\), I think we do the division first... so that's \(12 \div 4 = 3\). Then, \(8 + 3 = 11\).

## 3: Solve the second expression using the order of operations
For \((8+12) \div 4\), first, we do the thing in the brackets... \(8 + 12 = 20\). Then, \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 4: Compare the results of both expressions
So, the first expression equals 11 and the second equals 5. Now, let's compare them... \(11 \square 5\).

## 5: Determine the correct symbol
Since \(11\) is greater than \(5\), the symbol that belongs in the box is \(>\).

## 6: Choose the correct answer from the options given
The correct symbol is \(>\), which corresponds to option A) \( > \).

The best answer is A.
