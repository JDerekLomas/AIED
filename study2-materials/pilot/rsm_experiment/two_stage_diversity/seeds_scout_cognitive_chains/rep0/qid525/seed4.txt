## Step 1: Convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions
First, I need to convert \(2 \frac{7}{10}\) and \(2 \frac{1}{4}\) into improper fractions. For \(2 \frac{7}{10}\), I multiply the whole number part by the denominator and then add the numerator: \(2 \times 10 + 7 = 20 + 7 = 27\). So, \(2 \frac{7}{10} = \frac{27}{10}\). For \(2 \frac{1}{4}\), I do the same: \(2 \times 4 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9\). So, \(2 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4}\).

## 2: Find a common denominator for the improper fractions
To add \(\frac{27}{10}\) and \(\frac{9}{4}\), I need a common denominator. The denominators are 10 and 4. I think the common denominator could be 20 because 10 and 4 both go into 20.

## 3: Convert the improper fractions to have the common denominator
For \(\frac{27}{10}\), I multiply the numerator and denominator by 2 to get the denominator to 20: \(\frac{27 \times 2}{10 \times 2} = \frac{54}{20}\). For \(\frac{9}{4}\), I multiply the numerator and denominator by 5 to get the denominator to 20: \(\frac{9 \times 5}{4 \times 5} = \frac{45}{20}\).

## 4: Add the fractions
Now, I add \(\frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20}\). This equals \(\frac{54 + 45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}\).

## 5: Convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number
To convert \(\frac{99}{20}\) into a mixed number, I divide 99 by 20. 20 goes into 99, 4 times with a remainder of 19. So, \(\frac{99}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}\).

## 6: Choose the correct answer
Looking at the options provided:
- A: \(\frac{99}{20}\)
- B: \(4 \frac{19}{20}\)
- C: \(\frac{99}{40}\)
- D: \(4 \frac{8}{14}\)

I'm pretty sure my answer is B.

The best answer is B.
