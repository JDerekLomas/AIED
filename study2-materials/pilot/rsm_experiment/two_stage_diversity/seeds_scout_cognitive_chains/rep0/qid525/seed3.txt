## Step 1: Convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions
To add these mixed numbers, \( 2 \frac{7}{10} \) and \( 2 \frac{1}{4} \), I first need to convert them into improper fractions. For \( 2 \frac{7}{10} \), I do \( 2 \times 10 + 7 = 20 + 7 = 27 \), so it becomes \( \frac{27}{10} \). For \( 2 \frac{1}{4} \), I do \( 2 \times 4 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \), so it becomes \( \frac{9}{4} \).

## 2: Find a common denominator for the improper fractions
Now, I need to find a common denominator for \( \frac{27}{10} \) and \( \frac{9}{4} \). The denominators are 10 and 4. I think the common denominator could be 20, since 10 and 4 both go into 20.

## 3: Convert the improper fractions to have the common denominator
For \( \frac{27}{10} \), to get the denominator to 20, I multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2, getting \( \frac{27 \times 2}{10 \times 2} = \frac{54}{20} \). For \( \frac{9}{4} \), to get the denominator to 20, I multiply both the numerator and denominator by 5, getting \( \frac{9 \times 5}{4 \times 5} = \frac{45}{20} \).

## 4: Add the fractions
Now that they have the same denominator, I can add them: \( \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} \).

## 5: Convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number
To convert \( \frac{99}{20} \) into a mixed number, I divide 99 by 20. 20 goes into 99, 4 times with a remainder. \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \), and \( 99 - 80 = 19 \). So, \( \frac{99}{20} \) as a mixed number is \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \).

## 6: Choose the correct answer
Comparing my answer \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \) to the options given: A) \( \frac{99}{20} \) is the improper fraction I had, B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \) matches my final answer, C) \( \frac{99}{40} \) is not what I got, and D) \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \) doesn't match. So, my answer is B.

The best answer is B.
