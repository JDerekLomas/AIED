## Step 1: First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.
I have to do the multiplication first: \(4 \times 2\).

## 2: Calculate \(4 \times 2\).
\(4 \times 2 = 8\).

## 3: Now, substitute the result back into the equation.
So, the equation becomes \(3 - 5 + 8\).

## 4: Next, I do the addition and subtraction from left to right.
First, \(3 - 5\).

## 5: Calculate \(3 - 5\).
\(3 - 5 = -2\).

## 6: Now, add 8 to -2.
\(-2 + 8 = 6\).

## 7: I have found my answer.
The equation \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\) equals \(6\).

## 8: Choose the correct answer from the options provided.
Given my calculation, the answer is A) \(6\).

The best answer is A.
