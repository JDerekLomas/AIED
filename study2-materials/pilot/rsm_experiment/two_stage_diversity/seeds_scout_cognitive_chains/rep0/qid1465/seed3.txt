## Step 1: First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.
I see there are no parentheses or exponents, so I will start with multiplication. The equation given is $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$. I need to do the multiplication first.

## 2: Calculate the multiplication part of the equation, $4 \times 2$.
$4 \times 2 = 8$, so now the equation looks like $3 - 5 + 8$.

## 3: Next, I will perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.
Start with $3 - 5$. I'm not sure... um... $3 - 5 = -2$.

## 4: Now, I add $8$ to $-2$.
$-2 + 8 = 6$. I'm pretty sure that's right...

## 5: Check the answer choices to see which one matches my solution.
My solution is $6$, so I'll look for $6$ in the choices. Ah, there it is: A) $6$.

The best answer is A.
