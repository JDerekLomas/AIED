## Step 1: First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). In this case, I have multiplication and addition/subtraction.

## 2: I will start by doing the multiplication part: \(4 \times 2\). 
\(4 \times 2 = 8\).

## 3: Now, I rewrite the equation with the multiplication done:
\(3 - 5 + 8\).

## 4: Next, I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right. First, \(3 - 5\):
\(3 - 5 = -2\).

## 5: Now, I add 8 to -2:
\(-2 + 8 = 6\).

## 6: I'm pretty sure that's right... let me check the answer choices:
A) \(6\)
B) \(4\)
C) \(-12\)
D) \(-10\)

## 7: Yeah, I got \(6\), so my answer is A) \(6\).

The best answer is A.
