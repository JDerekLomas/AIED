## Step 1: Write down the expression
The expression given is \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\).

## Step 2: Multiply 4 by 2
First, I need to do the multiplication. So, \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

## 3: Rewrite the expression with the multiplication done
Now the expression looks like \(3 - 5 + 8\).

## 4: Subtract 5 from 3
Next, I do the subtraction: \(3 - 5 = -2\).

## 5: Add 8 to -2
Then, I add 8 to -2: \(-2 + 8 = 6\).

## 6: Check the work
Let me check my work... yeah, it looks right.

## 7: Choose the answer
So, my answer is... A) \(6\).

The best answer is A.
