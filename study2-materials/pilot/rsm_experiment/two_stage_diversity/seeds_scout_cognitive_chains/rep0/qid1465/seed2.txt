## Step 1: First, I need to follow the order of operations, which is BIDMAS/BODMAS. I think that's what my teacher called it, right? It means Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.

## 2: Looking at the equation \(3-5+4 \times 2\), I don't see any brackets or indices, so I can skip those. There's no division either. Now, I see there's a multiplication: \(4 \times 2\). I'm pretty sure I can do that. \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

## 3: So now, my equation looks like this: \(3 - 5 + 8\). I'm going to do the addition and subtraction from left to right, I think. First, \(3 - 5\). Ugh, I'm not good with negatives... Okay, so if I have 3 and I take away 5, that's like... -2, right?

## 4: Now my equation looks like \(-2 + 8\). This is easy! If I have -2 and I add 8, that's like... moving 8 steps to the right on the number line from -2. So, that's... 6! Yeah, I'm sure that's right.

## 5: Let me just check my work real quick. \(3 - 5 = -2\). And then \(-2 + 8 = 6\). Yeah, I'm pretty sure I got it.

The best answer is A.
