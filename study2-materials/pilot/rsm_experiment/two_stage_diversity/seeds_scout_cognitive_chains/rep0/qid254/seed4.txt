To find the mean, we need to add up all the numbers and then... um... I think we divide by how many numbers there are. Yeah.

So, let's add them up: 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = ... 

0 + 1 = 1
1 + 3 = 4
4 + 4 = 8
8 + 7 = 15

So, the total is 15. And there are... let me count them... 0, 1, 3, 4, 7... that's 5 numbers.

So, we divide 15 by 5... 

Okay, now let's look at the options:

A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \)

If we calculate the top part: 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = ...

1 + 3 = 4
4 + 4 = 8
8 + 7 = 15

So, it's \( \frac{15}{5} \), which is 3. That looks right.

B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \)

This one looks weird because of the ÷ 5 just at the end. I think that's not right because it would be dividing just the 7 by 5, not the total by 5. Unless... no, that can't be right. You have to add them all up first.

C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \)

This one is dividing by 4, but there are 5 numbers, so that's not right.

D) None of them

I'm not sure yet...

Okay, so A looks like it could be right. Let's cross out B and C because they look definitely wrong.

B is definitely wrong because it divides just the 7 by 5, which doesn't make sense.

And C is wrong because it says there are 4 numbers, but there are 5.

So, I think... A. 

The answer is A.
