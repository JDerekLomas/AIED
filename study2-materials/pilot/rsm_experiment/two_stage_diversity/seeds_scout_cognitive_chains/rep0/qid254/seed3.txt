To find the mean, we need to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are, right?

## Step 1: Add up all the numbers
The numbers are \(0, 1, 3, 4, 7\). So, we add them up:
\(0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = ?\)

Let me do that...
\(0 + 1 = 1\)
\(1 + 3 = 4\)
\(4 + 4 = 8\)
\(8 + 7 = 15\)

So, the total is \(15\).

## Step 2: Count how many numbers there are
There are \(5\) numbers.

## 3: Calculate the mean
To find the mean, we divide the total by the number of numbers:
\(\frac{15}{5} = 3\)

## 4: Compare with the given options
Now, let's look at the options:

A: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \)
B: \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \)
C: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \)
D: None of them

## 5: Evaluate option A
For A, they add \(1+3+4+7 = 15\), then divide by \(5\), which gives \(\frac{15}{5} = 3\). That looks right.

## 6: Evaluate option B
For B, \(0+1+3+4+7 = 15\), but then it's \(15 \div 5\), which is also \(3\). But, I'm not sure if that's right because it looks a bit weird without brackets.

## 7: Evaluate option C
For C, they add \(1+3+4+7 = 15\), then divide by \(4\), which gives \(\frac{15}{4} = 3.75\). That doesn't look right.

## 8: Choose the correct option
Option A seems correct because it properly adds all the numbers and then divides by the correct count of numbers. I'm not sure about B because... um... isn't it the order of operations or something? But A definitely looks right.

The final answer is A.
