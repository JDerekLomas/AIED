To find the mean, we need to add up all the numbers and then divide by... um... how many numbers there are, right?

So, let's add them up: 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = ?

0 + 1 = 1
1 + 3 = 4
4 + 4 = 8
8 + 7 = 15

So, the total is 15. And there are... 5 numbers.

Now, let's look at the options:

A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \)

If I calculate the top part... 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = ?

1 + 3 = 4
4 + 4 = 8
8 + 7 = 15

So, it's \( \frac{15}{5} \) which is 3. That looks right.

B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \)

Wait, isn't this one... no, it can't be right because it's dividing just the 7 by 5. That's not right.

C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \)

This one is dividing by 4, but there are 5 numbers... so that's not right.

D) None of them

I'm not sure... A looks right to me.

So, I'm going to cross out B and C because they don't seem right.

[Crossing out B and C]

Now, let's check A properly. 

## Step 1: Calculate the sum for option A
The sum for option A is \( 1+3+4+7 = 15 \).

## 2: Divide by the number of values for option A
Dividing by 5 (the number of values) gives \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

## 3: Confirm if A is correct
Option A seems correct because it adds up all the numbers except 0.

## 4: Check if 0 should be included
Actually, to calculate the mean, we should include 0. So, let's try that: \( 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15 \), and there are 5 numbers.

## 5: Conclusion
Since A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) actually doesn't include 0, my calculation for A wasn't fully correct in the context of the question. 
The actual calculation including zero is:
\( 0+1+3+4+7 = 15 \)
So \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \)

## 6: Confirm the correct option
Since option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) which I incorrectly verified, 
if we do \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \) that's actually the right formula.

The best answer is A.
