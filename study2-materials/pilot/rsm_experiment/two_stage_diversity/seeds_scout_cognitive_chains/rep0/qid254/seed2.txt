## Step 1: Understand what the mean is
The mean is like the average. To find it, you add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are.

## Step 2: Add up all the numbers
The numbers are 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. So, I add them up: 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = ... um... 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 3 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8, 8 + 7 = 15. So, the total is 15.

## 3: Count how many numbers there are
There are 5 numbers.

## 4: Calculate the mean
To find the mean, I divide the total by the number of numbers: 15 ÷ 5 = 3.

## 5: Look at the options
Now, I need to see which of the options will give me the correct answer.

## 6: Analyze option A
Option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). Let me calculate it: 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15, and 15 ÷ 5 = 3. That looks right.

## 7: Analyze option B
Option B is \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \). Hmm, I'm not sure about the order of operations here... Does the division happen first? I think it might... But let's calculate it properly: if I do 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 first, that equals 15 like we found before. But then if I do 7 ÷ 5 first... that equals 1.4, and then 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1.4 = 9.4. No, that's not right.

## 8: Analyze option C
Option C is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \). Let's see... 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15, and 15 ÷ 4 = 3.75. That's not right.

## 9: Choose the correct option
From what I've done, option A seems to be correct because it equals 3, which is what we found the mean to be. I don't really need to check D because A looks good.

The best answer is A.
