To find the mean, we need to add up all the numbers and then... um... divide by something.

First, let's add up all the numbers:

\(0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = \)

I'm going to do this step by step...

\(0 + 1 = 1\)

\(1 + 3 = 4\)

\(4 + 4 = 8\)

\(8 + 7 = 15\)

So, the total is \(15\).

Now, I think we have to divide by... uh... the number of numbers there are. Let me count them...

\(0, 1, 3, 4, 7\)... that's \(5\) numbers.

So, we divide by \(5\).

The calculation for the mean is: \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \)

Now, let me compare this to the options:

A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) - wait, they've missed the \(0\). That's not right, is it?

B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \) - this looks dodgy... I think the division by \(5\) should be... you know, divided into the whole thing, not just the \(7\). That would change the answer.

C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \) - they've missed the \(0\) again and divided by \(4\) instead of \(5\). No.

D) None of them - well, A and C are definitely wrong. And B... yeah, B is wrong too.

But hold on... 

If I rewrite A with the \(0\) included, it's actually:

\( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \)

Which is what we want. 

So... even though A is written without the \(0\), if I assume it was meant to have the \(0\), then...

The answer is: A
