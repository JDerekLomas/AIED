## Step 1: Understand the equation given
The equation given is \(y = 3x^{2}\). I need to find \(y\) when \(x = 0.3\).

## Step 2: Substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation
To find \(y\), I'll substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation \(y = 3x^{2}\). So, \(y = 3 \times (0.3)^{2}\).

## 3: Calculate \(0.3^{2}\)
First, I calculate \(0.3^{2}\). That means \(0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09\).

## 4: Multiply by 3
Now, I multiply \(0.09\) by \(3\). So, \(3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\).

## 5: Check the answer choices
The calculations seem straightforward. Let me check the answer choices to see if I got it right.

## 6: Match my answer to the choices
My answer is \(0.27\). Let me see... A) \(0.81\), B) \(0.27\), C) \(1.8\), D) \(2.7\). Ah, B) \(0.27\) matches my answer.

The best answer is B.
