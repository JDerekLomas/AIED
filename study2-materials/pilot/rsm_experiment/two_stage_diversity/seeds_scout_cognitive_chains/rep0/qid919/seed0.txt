## Step 1: Understand the equation given
The equation given is \(y = 3x^2\). This means to find \(y\), we need to square \(x\) and then multiply by 3.

## 2: Substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation
Given \(x = 0.3\), we substitute it into the equation: \(y = 3 \times (0.3)^2\).

## 3: Calculate \((0.3)^2\)
\((0.3)^2 = 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09\).

## 4: Calculate \(y\)
Now, we multiply by 3: \(y = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\).

## 5: Check the calculation
Let me check that... yeah, \(0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09\) and \(3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\). That looks right.

## 6: Choose the answer
Looking at the options: A) \(0.81\), B) \(0.27\), C) \(1.8\), D) \(2.7\). My calculation matches option B.

The best answer is B.
