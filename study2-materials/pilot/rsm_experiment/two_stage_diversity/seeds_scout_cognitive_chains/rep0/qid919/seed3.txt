## Step 1: Understand the equation given
The equation given is \(y = 3x^{2}\). I need to find \(y\) when \(x = 0.3\).

## Step 2: Substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation
So, I substitute \(x = 0.3\) into \(y = 3x^{2}\), which gives me \(y = 3 \times (0.3)^{2}\).

## 3: Calculate \((0.3)^{2}\)
To calculate \((0.3)^{2}\), I do \(0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09\).

## 4: Multiply by 3
Now, I multiply \(0.09\) by \(3\), which gives \(0.09 \times 3 = 0.27\).

## 5: Check my work
Let me check my work... \(y = 3 \times 0.3^{2}\)... yeah, that's right. \(0.3^{2} = 0.09\) and \(3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\). I'm pretty sure that's correct.

## 6: Choose the answer
So, the answer is... B) \(0.27\).

The best answer is B.
