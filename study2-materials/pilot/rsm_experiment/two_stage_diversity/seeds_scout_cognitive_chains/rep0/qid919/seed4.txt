## Step 1: Understand the equation given
The equation given is \(y = 3x^{2}\). I need to find \(y\) when \(x = 0.3\).

## Step 2: Substitute \(x = 0.3\) into the equation
So, \(y = 3 \times (0.3)^{2}\).

## 3: Calculate \((0.3)^{2}\)
\((0.3)^{2} = 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09\), I think.

## 4: Multiply by 3
Then, \(y = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\).

## 5: Check the calculation
Let me check... \(0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09\) and \(3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\). Yeah, that looks right.

## 6: Choose the answer
So, the answer is... B) \(0.27\).

The best answer is B.
