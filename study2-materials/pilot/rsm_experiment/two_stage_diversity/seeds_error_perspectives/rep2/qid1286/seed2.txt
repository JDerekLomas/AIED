As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify a specific difficulty in the **algebraic rearrangement of the "denominator of a fraction" within a formula.**

Specifically, many students struggle with the transition from $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ to $3V = 4\pi r^3$.

**The Reason for Difficulty: Cross-Multiplication Confusion**
When solving for $r$, a student must move the coefficient $\frac{4}{3}$ to the other side. A common error at this specific step is "partial inversion" or incorrect association of the constants.

1.  **The $\pi$ placement trap:** Students often conceptually group the "constants" together. Because $\pi$ is often written next to the 4 in the numerator ($V = \frac{4\pi r^3}{3}$), students frequently fail to recognize that both $4$ and $\pi$ are in the numerator position. 
2.  **The Misstep:** A common mistake is to "flip" the entire constant term incorrectly, leading them to search for a version where the 4 remains in the numerator or the $\pi$ moves to the numerator in the final expression. This leads them directly to **Distractor A** ($\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}}$), where they have multiplied the volume by the original constants rather than dividing by them.

**Why this is a specific notational trap:** 
In Option C (the correct answer) and Option B, the $\pi$ is in the denominator. Students who struggle with the "Change of Subject" often perceive a fraction multiplied by a symbol ($\frac{4}{3} \times \pi$) as a "split" entity. They correctly move the 3 to the top but fail to realize that $\pi$—acting as a multiplier—must join the 4 in the denominator. Distractor B lures students who understand that $\pi$ belongs in the denominator but forget to invert the $\frac{4}{3}$ correctly, while Distractor C requires the precise execution of dividing $V$ by the fraction $(\frac{4\pi}{3})$.
