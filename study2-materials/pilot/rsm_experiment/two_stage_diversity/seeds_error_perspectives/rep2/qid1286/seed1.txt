One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **arithmetic trap involved in isolating the $r^3$ term**, specifically when dealing with the coefficient $\frac{4}{3}\pi$.

Many students struggle with the multi-step algebraic manipulation required to "move" the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ to the other side of the equation. A common error occurs during the division by a fraction: students often forget to multiply by the reciprocal.

Instead of correctly performing:
1. $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$
2. $\frac{3V}{4} = \pi r^3$ (Multiplying by $3$ and dividing by $4$)
3. $\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$

Students frequently mix up the numerator and denominator, leading them to select **Option B** ($\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}$). They see the $4$ and $3$ in the original formula and instinctively keep them in their original positions (4 on top, 3 on bottom) while moving them across the equals sign, rather than understanding that to "undo" a multiplication by $\frac{4}{3}$, one must multiply the opposite side by $\frac{3}{4}$. This makes Option B the most common "distractor" for students who understand the general process of rearranging formulas but have weak foundational skills in fractional operations.
