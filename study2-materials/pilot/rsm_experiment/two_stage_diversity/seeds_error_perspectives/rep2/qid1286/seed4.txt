As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **inversion of the fractional coefficient $\frac{4}{3}$ during the literal equation rearrangement** as the specific point of difficulty.

Specifically, students often struggle with the multi-step process required to isolate $r^3$ from the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. Many students fail to treat the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ and the constant $\pi$ as a single coefficient. Instead, they attempt to "move" them sequentially. 

**The specific trap:**
When students try to "move" the $3$, they correctly multiply both sides by $3$ to get $3V$. However, when then attempting to remove the $4$, they may mistakenly multiply by $4$ (thinking "it's part of the fraction") or subtract it, rather than dividing.

Option **A** ($\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}}$) is a high-frequency distractor for this exact reason. It appeals to students who recognize all the correct components of the sphere formula ($V, 4, \pi, 3$) but lack the procedural fluency in algebraic manipulation to recognize that **inverse operations** must be applied. These students essentially "re-assemble" the symbols they see in the original formula into a new structure that "looks" like an answer, without actually performing the inverse steps of multiplying by $3$ and dividing by $4\pi$. 

Students who struggle with "change of subject" tasks often default to a visual matching strategy; if the original formula has $4$ on top and $3$ on the bottom, they are psychologically predisposed to choose an answer that maintains that vertical orientation, leading them directly to the incorrect Option A.
