One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **algebraic cognitive load of reversing the fractional coefficient \(\frac{4}{3}\)** during the isolation of $r$.

Specifically, many students struggle with the multi-step nature of moving a fraction from one side of an equation to the other within the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. There are two common "trap" behaviors that occur here:

1.  **Partial Inversion:** A student may correctly recognize they need to multiply by $3$, but fail to realize they must also divide by $4$. This leads them to look for expressions containing $3V$ but potentially misplacing the $4$ or $\pi$, making options **C** and **D** look deceptively similar.
2.  **Linear Association:** Because students often see the $4$ and $\pi$ written "on top" or next to each other ($4\pi$), they may instinctively move them as a single block. A student who incorrectly associates the multiplication order might mistakenly multiply $V$ by the numerator ($4\pi$) and divide by the denominator ($3$), leading them directly to the distractor **Option A**.

To arrive at the correct answer (**C**), a student must successfully execute a "reciprocal flip," understanding that to isolate $r^3$, $V$ must be multiplied by $\frac{3}{4\pi}$. The visual layout of the options preys on those who grasp the cubic root aspect but perform the "fractional flip" incorrectly.
