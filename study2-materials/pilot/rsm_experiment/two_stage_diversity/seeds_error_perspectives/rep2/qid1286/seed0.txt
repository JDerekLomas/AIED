One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **arithmetic trap of "coefficient inversion" during the isolation of $r^3$.**

To solve for the radius, a student must rearrange the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. Research in algebraic manipulation suggests that when students encounter a coefficient that is a fraction ($\frac{4}{3}$), they often struggle with the dual operation of multiplying by the reciprocal.

Specifically, a student may correctly identify that they need to "get rid" of the $\frac{4}{3}$, but instead of multiplying the $V$ side by 3 and dividing by 4, they mentally "drift" the numbers across the equals sign without flipping them, or they mistakenly associate the $\pi$ with the denominator. This lead them to calculate $r^3 = \frac{4V}{3\pi}$, leading directly to **distractor B**.

The presence of very similar-looking components in the options ($4$, $3$, $\pi$, and $\sqrt[3]{\quad}$) increases the "cognitive load" of the verification step. If a student performs the inversion of $\frac{4}{3}$ mentally rather than writing it out, they are highly susceptible to picking the option where the numbers simply "stay where they were" ($4$ on top, $3$ on the bottom).
