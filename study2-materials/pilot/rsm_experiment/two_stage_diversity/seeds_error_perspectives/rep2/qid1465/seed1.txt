A primary reason students find this question difficult is a **notational/structural trap** related to how they perceive the left-to-right processing of the subtraction sign. Specifically, students frequently apply the "Addition before Subtraction" rule from the **PEMDAS/BEDMAS** acronym too literally.

### The Specific Error: Misplaced Grouping in "AS" (Addition-Subtraction)
In the simplified expression $3 - 5 + 8$ (after performing the multiplication), many students see the plus sign and believe they must perform $5 + 8$ first.

**The mental process of the error:**
1.  Student performs $4 \times 2 = 8$. Expression is now: $3 - 5 + 8$.
2.  Following the "A" before "S" in PEMDAS, they see $5 + 8$.
3.  They calculate $5 + 8 = 13$.
4.  The final step becomes $3 - 13 = -10$.

**Why this is a trap in this specific problem:**
This error leads directly to **Distractor D (-10)**. This is a "strong" distractor because it rewards a student's knowledge of the acronym (PEMDAS) while punishing their lack of understanding that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and must be solved from left to right. 

Because the expression begins with a subtraction ($3 - 5$) but the acronym lists Addition first, the problem is specifically engineered to catch students who treat the mnemonic as a rigid vertical hierarchy rather than a grouping of operations.
