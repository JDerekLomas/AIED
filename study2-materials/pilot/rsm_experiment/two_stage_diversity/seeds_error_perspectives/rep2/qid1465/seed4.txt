As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **left-to-right processing trap in addition and subtraction** as the primary reason students find this specific question difficult, specifically leading to **Distractor B (4)**.

### The Specific Difficulty: The "A before S" Priority Error
In many curricula, the mnemonic **PEMDAS** (or BEDMAS/BODMAS) is taught in a way that creates a "hierarchical literalism." Because the 'A' (Addition) precedes the 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym, students frequently develop a misconception that all addition operations must be completed before any subtraction operations, regardless of their position in the string.

**The Concrete Error Path:**
1.  A student correctly performs the multiplication first: $4 \times 2 = 8$.
2.  The expression remains: $3 - 5 + 8$.
3.  **The Error:** Following the "Addition before Subtraction" misconception, the student ignores the left-to-right rule and jumps to the addition of $5$ and $8$. Crucially, they often treat the "$-$" as a separator rather than an operator attached to the $5$, or they simply add the absolute values: $5 + 8 = 13$.
4.  This leaves $3 - 13$, resulting in **$-10$ (Distractor D)**.

**Why this specific question is a "trap":**
However, a more nuanced error occurs if the student processes the "$-5 + 8$" but lacks fluency with negative numbers. They may see $3 - 5 + 8$ and erroneously "cluster" the addition. If they mistakenly subtract $5$ from $8$ first to get $3$, and then add it to the initial $3$ (getting $6$), they arrive at the correct answer through an illegal move. 

But the most common point of failure is **Distractor B ($4$)**, which occurs if the student treats the minus sign as a wall and evaluates the multiplication and the addition as a block:
*   Student sees $3 - (5 + 4 \times 2)$
*   $4 \times 2 = 8$
*   $5 + 8 = 13$
*   Then $3 - 13 = -10$ (as mentioned above) OR they misinterpret the subtraction entirely as $5 - 3 + 2$.

### Summary
The primary difficulty is the **lack of "L-R associativity" for Addition and Subtraction.** Students often fail to see $3 - 5 + 8$ as a sequence of equal-priority moves, instead feeling a "mnemonic pull" to perform the addition ($5+8$) first because "A comes before S" in the acronym they memorized.
