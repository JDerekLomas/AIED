As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **"Left-to-Right Subtraction Trap"** involving the sign of the number 5 as the primary point of difficulty.

Specifically, students often fail to perceive the subtraction sign as an **operator bound to the term following it** (a negative 5) and instead treat it as a separable "gap" between terms.

### The Specific Error: Left-to-Right Processing over Operator Hierarchy
While many students correctly identify that multiplication ($4 \times 2 = 8$) comes first, they often struggle with the remaining expression: $3 - 5 + 8$.

1.  **The Misconception:** In many elementary curricula, "Addition" (A) precedes "Subtraction" (S) in the PEMDAS/BODMAS mnemonic. This leads students to believe they must perform all additions globally across the string before any subtractions.
2.  **The Error Step:** A student may isolate $5 + 8$, calculating it as $13$, and then bring down the leading $3$ and the minus sign to get $3 - 13$.
3.  **The Outcome:** This results in **Option D: $-10$**.

### Why this is a "Notational Trap"
This difficulty is exacerbated by the **visual proximity** of the plus sign to the 5 and the 8. To a student who has not yet conceptualized subtraction as "adding a negative," the expression $3 - 5 + 8$ looks like two separate tasks: a "3" and a "5 + 8". 

Because the "+" symbol is physically present while the positive sign of the "3" is implicit (invisible), the brain instinctively clusters the visible operator ($+$) with its neighboring digits ($5$ and $8$) before reconciling the "3 -" at the start of the string. This reflects a failure in **structural sensing**—the ability to see the expression as a collection of signed terms $(+3) + (-5) + (+8)$.
