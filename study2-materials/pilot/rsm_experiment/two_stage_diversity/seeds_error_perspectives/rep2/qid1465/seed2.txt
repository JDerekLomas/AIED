One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "Left-to-Right" trap**, which competes with the formal order of operations (PEMDAS/BIDMAS).

Research suggests that students are cognitively biased toward processing arithmetic expressions as they read text: linearly from left to right. In this specific question, the first two terms are $3 - 5$. If a student follows this linear impulse, they calculate:
1. $3 - 5 = -2$
2. $-2 + 4 = 2$
3. $2 \times 2 = \mathbf{4}$

This results in **Option B**, which acts as a powerful "attractor." The difficulty lies in the fact that the addition and subtraction operators appear at the beginning of the string, while the multiplication—which must be prioritized—is tucked away at the end. This requires the student to actively inhibit their natural left-to-right reading reflex to scan the entire expression before performing the first calculation ($4 \times 2$). 

The presence of the negative result ($3-5 = -2$) adds a layer of "Executive Function" load; even if the student knows they should multiply first, the visual proximity of $3-5$ at the start of the line often triggers an automatic, impulsive calculation before the rule-based system kicks in.
