A primary reason students find this question difficult—specifically leading them to choose **A (Only Tom)**—is a misunderstanding of the **distributive requirement of the multiplication property of equality** (often described as a failure to "multiply every term").

### The Specific Difficulty: "Selective" Multiplication
Many students correctly identify Tom's step (adding 5 to both sides) as valid because it deals with the "loosest" term first. However, they struggle to evaluate Katie’s step ($x - 5 = 36$) because of a common **notational trap**: they do not see the equation as a balanced whole, but rather as a string of terms.

**The Error:**
Students frequently believe that to "cancel" a denominator, they only need to multiply the specific term containing that denominator. They see:
$$\frac{x}{3} \times 3 - 5 = 12 \times 3$$
which leads them to $x - 5 = 36$. Because this matches Katie's result, a student might mistakenly think she is correct. 

**The Counter-Intuition:**
However, mathematically, Katie is incorrect because the subtraction operator effectively "separates" the $-5$ from the division. To multiply the left side by $3$, the student must apply the distributive property: $3(\frac{x}{3} - 5)$, resulting in $x - 15 = 36$.

**Why this makes the question hard:**
The numbers $12$ and $36$ are "friendly" ($12 \times 3 = 36$), which creates **confirmation bias**. A student who incorrectly multiplies only the $x/3$ and the $12$ sees a "clean" number ($36$) and assumes the step is valid, overlooking the fact that the $-5$ was never multiplied by $3$. The question tests whether a student recognizes that the "shortcut" of multiplying by the denominator is only valid if applied to every single term on both sides of the equals sign.
