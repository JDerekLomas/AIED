One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **misapplication of the "multiplication shortcut" to a subtraction term** (specifically, failing to distribute the multiplication to all terms in the equation).

A significant number of students will erroneously choose **(C) Both Tom and Katie**, because Katie’s proposed line ($x-5=36$) mimics a common procedural error in solving two-step equations.

### The Specific Difficulty: The Visual Proximity Trap
When students see $\frac{x}{3}-5=12$, they are often taught to "get rid of the fraction by multiplying by the denominator." However, they frequently treat the $-5$ and the $12$ differently due to their positions:

1.  **The Error:** Students often focus solely on the "top" of the fraction and the right side of the equals sign. They visually associate the $3$ only with the $x$ and the $12$.
2.  **The Result:** They perform $3 \times \frac{x}{3}$ and $3 \times 12$ correctly, but leave the $-5$ untouched because it is not part of the "fraction block." This leads them to believe $x - 5 = 36$ is a mathematically sound step.
3.  **Why it is a trap:** Students who use the "change the side, change the sign" rule for Tom's method will see that $\frac{x}{3} = 17$ is correct. Because Katie’s result ($36$) is the "correct" product of $3 \times 12$, they assume she has also followed a valid (if different) shortcut.

In reality, if Katie were to multiply by 3, the entire left side must be multiplied, resulting in $x - 15 = 36$. Therefore, students find this difficult because **Katie’s error ($x - 5 = 36$) mirrors the most common structural misconception in early algebra**, making her incorrect reasoning appear intuitively plausible to a struggling learner.
