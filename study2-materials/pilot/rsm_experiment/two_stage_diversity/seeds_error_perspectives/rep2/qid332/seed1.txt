A primary reason students find this question difficult is the **visual "local" application of inverse operations**, specifically the failure to apply a multiplier to the entire side of an equation.

**The Notational Trap: Katie’s Selective Multiplication**

Many students will conclude that **Both (C)** are correct because Katie’s step ($x - 5 = 36$) appears to logically follow the "multiply by 3" rule. The difficulty lies in a specific cognitive error called **incomplete distribution**.

In the expression $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$, the term $\frac{x}{3}$ and the constant $-5$ are visually distinct. When a student decides to "multiply by 3" to cancel the denominator:
*   They physically or mentally "cross out" the $3$ under the $x$.
*   They correctly multiply the $12$ by $3$ to get $36$.
*   **The Error:** Because the $-5$ is not part of the fraction bar (it is not $\frac{x-5}{3}$), students often perceive it as an independent entity that is "outside" the operation. They fail to recognize that the properties of equality require the *entire* expression $(\frac{x}{3} - 5)$ to be multiplied by 3.

**Why this makes the question hard:**
Students who rely on "moving numbers to the other side" or "canceling out" rather than understanding "balanced operations on expressions" will see Katie’s working as a standard application of a rule. They miss the subtle but critical requirement that the $-5$ must become $-15$. Because $x-5=36$ looks like a "clean" algebraic move, it serves as a highly attractive distractor, leading students to choose **C** when the correct answer is **A**.
