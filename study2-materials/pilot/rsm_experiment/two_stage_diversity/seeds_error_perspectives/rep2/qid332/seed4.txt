One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **misapplication of the "multiplication shortcut" to a subtraction term**, leading many to believe Katie is correct.

A common student error in multi-step equations is the "linear" application of operations. Students are often taught to "get rid of the fraction" by multiplying by the denominator ($3$). A common cognitive shortcut is to multiply only the terms that appear "easiest" to reach—in this case, the $x/3$ and the $12$ on the RHS—while failing to distribute the $3$ to the independent constant ($-5$).

Specifically, students may find this difficult because:
*   **The Notational Trap:** In the expression $\frac{x}{3}-5$, the fraction bar only extends under the $x$. However, when a student decides to "multiply by $3$," they often perform a visual "cancellation" on the fraction and then skip directly across the minus sign to the other side of the equals sign.
*   **The Result:** This leads them to validate Katie's line ($x - 5 = 36$). Because Katie’s result *looks* like a standard next step in an equation-solving algorithm, students prioritize the procedural "move" (multiplying the 12 by 3) over the algebraic rule of maintaining equality by multiplying the entire left-hand side.

Therefore, students who lack a robust understanding of the distributive property (or the idea that an operation must be applied to the *entire* side of an equation) are highly likely to select **C**, incorrectly validating Katie’s flawed step.
