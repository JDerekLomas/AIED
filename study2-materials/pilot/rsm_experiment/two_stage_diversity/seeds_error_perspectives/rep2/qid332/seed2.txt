One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **misapplication of the "multiplication shortcut"** regarding the distributive property (the **Katie error**).

In particular, students frequently fail to recognize that if they choose to multiply by 3 as their first step, **every term** in the equation must be multiplied by 3, not just those they perceive as "being part of the fraction."

**The Notational Trap:**
The term-by-term nature of the equation $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$ creates a visual separation. A student following Katie’s logic sees the denominator $3$ and "moves it" to the other side to get $36$, or mistakenly thinks they have "cleared the fraction" for the first term alone. Because the $-5$ is not part of the numerator (it is not $\frac{x-5}{3} = 12$), the shortcut of multiplying just the $x$ and the $12$ by 3 fails.

**Why this makes the question hard:**
Many students are taught the "Order of Operations in Reverse" (SAMDIB) for solving equations. Tom correctly follows this by addressing the **Subtraction/Addition** first. However, students who prioritize "getting rid of the fraction" (a common heuristic) often fail to realize that **Multiplication/Division** applied to the whole equation must distribute across the $-5$. They see Katie's $x - 5 = 36$ as a logical "undoing" of the division without realizing she has neglected to transform the middle term into $-15$. 

This specific difficulty leads many students to choose **C (Both)** because Katie’s step *looks* like a standard algebraic move, even though it violates the property of equality.
