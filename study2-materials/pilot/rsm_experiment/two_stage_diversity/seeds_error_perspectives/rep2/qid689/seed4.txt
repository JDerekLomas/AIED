As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **"Linearization Misconception" (or "Division Order Trap")** as a specific reason students find this question difficult.

Specifically, students often default to **performing the operation with the numbers in the order they appear horizontally**, rather than following the algebraic logic of the denominator.

### The Specific Difficulty: The Left-to-Right Heuristic
Many students treat the fraction bar as a simple division symbol ($\div$) and then intuitively apply the **Commutative Property**, which they mistakenly extend from addition and multiplication to division. 

When a student sees:
$$10 = \frac{5}{p}$$
They often read the right-hand side as "5 and $p$ involved in division." Instead of performing the correct algebraic step (multiplying both sides by $p$), they mentally rephrase the equation to fit a more comfortable "Large Number $\div$ Small Number" template. They see the $10$ and the $5$ and immediately calculate **$10 \div 5 = 2$**.

### Why this leads to Error:
*   **The Trap (Option C):** Because $10 \div 5 = 2$, students will frequently select **Option C ($p=2$)**. This is a "low-effort" cognitive shortcut where the student manipulates the visible constants ($10$ and $5$) and ignores the structural position of the variable $p$.
*   **The Misconception:** They treat the equation as if it were $p = \frac{10}{5}$ or $10 = p \times 5$. 

### Why the numbers matter:
The choice of **10 and 5** makes this error significantly more likely than if the numbers were, for example, 10 and 3. Because 5 is a factor of 10, the "clean" result of the incorrect division ($2$) provides a false sense of fluency, leading the student to bypass the formal inverse operation ($10p = 5$) that would lead them to the correct answer ($p = 0.5$).
