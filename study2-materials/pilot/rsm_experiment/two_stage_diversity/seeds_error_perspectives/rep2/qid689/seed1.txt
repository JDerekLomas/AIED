As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle in this problem as the **"Division Order Fallacy"**—a common conceptual error where students believe the dividend and divisor are interchangeable.

### Specific Difficulty: The Commutative Property Trap

The primary reason students select **Option B ($p=50$)** or **Option C ($p=2$)** instead of the correct answer is a failure to navigate the inverse relationship of division correctly. 

Specifically, many students are taught that to "undo" a fraction, they must multiply. In this equation, a student often isolates the numbers $10$ and $5$ and assumes the operation required is $10 \div 5$. This occurs because:

1.  **Small-from-Large Bias:** Students have a deeply ingrained heuristic to "divide the bigger number by the smaller number" to avoid fractions. This leads them to calculate $10 \div 5 = 2$, falling directly into the trap of **Option C**.
2.  **Mistaken Inverse Logic:** To "isolate" $p$, students frequently attempt to move the 5. However, instead of performing the correct algebraic step ($10p = 5$), they subconsciously treat the equation as $p = 10 \div 5$ (treating 10 as the dividend) or $p = 10 \times 5$ (leading to **Option B**).

### The Visual/Notational Trap
The notation $\frac{5}{p}$ is visually similar to $\frac{p}{5}$. In the latter, the solution would indeed be 50. Students who struggle with **algebraic "positionality"** often ignore whether the unknown is the divisor or the dividend, treating the equation as a cluster of three terms ($10, 5, p$) and picking the most "comfortable" relationship between them. This is a failure of **structure sense**—the ability to see the denominator as the "operator" rather than just a number at the bottom of a stack.
