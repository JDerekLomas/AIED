One specific reason why students frequently find this question difficult is a **misapplication of the "divide to solve" shortcut**, often referred to as the "division by the larger number" reflex.

In early algebra, students are conditioned to isolate variables by dividing the constant on the right by the coefficient on the left (e.g., $10x = 5$ leads to $x = 0.5$). When confronted with $10 = \frac{5}{p}$, many students cognitively bypass the step of multiplying by the denominator ($10p = 5$) and instead simply process the two visible integers ($10$ and $5$) through a familiar division operation.

Because $10 \div 5 = 2$, students frequently select **Option C ($p=2$)**. This is a **procedural trap** because the brain prefers the integer result of $10 \div 5 = 2$ over the fractional result of $5 \div 10 = 0.5$. The student ignores the reciprocal nature of the variable’s position and performs the "easiest" division possible between the two given digits.
