As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify a specific difficulty in this question related to the **inverse relationship between the divisor and the quotient**, specifically when the resulting variable is "smaller" than the terms in the expression.

### The Specific Difficulty: The "Larger Number" Heuristic
A significant number of students will erroneously choose **B) $p = 50$** because of a cognitive shortcut known as the "multiplication bias."

**The Trap:**
When students see a whole number result ($10$) and a numerator ($5$), their intuition often defaults to a "large numbers must result from multiplication" logic. The mental process follows this path:
1. The student identifies the relationship between 10 and 5.
2. Instead of performing the algebraic step of multiplying both sides by $p$ (leading to $10p = 5$), they look at the numbers $10$ and $5$ and intuitively feel the answer must be $50$ because $10 \times 5 = 50$.
3. This is reinforced by a common misunderstanding of the equals sign as an operator (a "one-way street"). The student reads the equation as "10 is what happens when you do something with 5 and $p$," and $50 \div 5$ feels more "natural" than $5 \div 0.5$.

**The Visual/Notational Conflict:**
In many introductory division problems, the dividend is larger than the divisor ($10 = 20 / 2$). This equation breaks that pattern ($5 < 10$), forcing the student to accept that $p$ must be a fraction or decimal. Students who have not yet reached "formal operational" fluency with reciprocals will often revert to the most familiar arithmetic operation available between the two given integers ($10$ and $5$), leading them directly to $50$ or $2$, rather than the correct $0.5$.
