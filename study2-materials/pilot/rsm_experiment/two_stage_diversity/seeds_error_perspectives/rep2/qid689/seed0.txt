One specific reason why students frequently find this question difficult is the **"larger divided by smaller" heuristic**, which leads them to select **Option C ($p=2$)**.

In many introductory division problems, students are conditioned to believe that division always involves a larger number being divided by a smaller one to produce a smaller result ($10 \div 5 = 2$). When faced with $\frac{5}{p} = 10$, a student’s cognitive "shortcut" often bypasses the algebraic structure of the equation and instead scans the numbers for a familiar relationship. Because 10 and 5 are visually present, the brain reflexively performs the most intuitive operation: $10 \div 5 = 2$.

This error is exacerbated by the **visual position** of the numbers. In the equation $10 = \frac{5}{p}$, the "10" and "5" are prominent, while $p$ is tucked away in the denominator. A student might incorrectly treat the equation as $p = 10 \div 5$ because they are used to solving for a variable that is isolated on one side, leading them to misapply the inverse operation (dividing 10 by 5 instead of dividing 5 by 10).
