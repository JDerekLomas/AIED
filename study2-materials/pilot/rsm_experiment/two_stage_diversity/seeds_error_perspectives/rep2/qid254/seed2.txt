One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual trap of the digit "0"** in the numerator of Option A.

Many students instinctively believe that because zero has no numerical value in an addition sum, it should be omitted from the notation. Option A presents the sum as $(1+3+4+7)$, which is numerically equivalent to $(0+1+3+4+7)$. A student who correctly remembers that they must divide by the total number of items ($n=5$) will see the denominator of $5$ and the "correct" sum in the numerator and conclude that A is the right answer.

However, this creates a **conceptual dissonance regarding the definition of a data point**. In formal mathematical notation, $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ is technically correct, but students often conflate "the sum doesn't change" with "the number of items doesn't change." If a student perceives the missing "0" in the numerator as a sign that the number wasn't counted, they may gravitate toward Option C ($\frac{...}{4}$), treating the zero as non-existent rather than a value of zero. 

Conversely, the "correct" choice (D) is difficult because Option A is **mathematically equivalent but notationally incomplete**, forcing the student to decide if the absence of the $0$ in the top string constitutes a "wrong calculation" or merely a "simplified" one.
