One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conceptual status of zero as a value vs. a non-value**, leading to a conflict between Options A and C.

In the context of calculating a mean, students frequently hold a misconception that zero "doesn't count" because it does not contribute to the total sum. This creates two specific "traps":

1.  **The Denominator Dilemma (Option C):** A student who views zero as an empty placeholder rather than a data point will correctly sum the non-zero numbers but then divide by 4 (the count of non-zero entries). They equate "amount of numbers" with "amount of visible value," leading them to choose C.
2.  **The Summation Oversight (Option A):** This is a sophisticated "notational trap." Option A correctly identifies that the divisor should be 5, but it omits the "0" from the numerator. While adding zero does not change the numerical sum, a student may be unsure if the expression is *formally* correct without representing all data points. If they prioritize the divisor ($n=5$) over the formal inclusion of the zero in the sum, they will incorrectly conclude that Option A is the right calculation.

**Why this is specific to this problem:**
If the set were $\{2, 1, 3, 4, 7\}$, the number of terms (5) would match the number of non-zero terms (5), and the ambiguity would disappear. The inclusion of **0** forces a choice between treating it as a statistical entity or a mathematical nullity. Consequently, many students will find it difficult to decide if a calculation can be "correct" if it omits a zero from the addition but includes it in the count.
