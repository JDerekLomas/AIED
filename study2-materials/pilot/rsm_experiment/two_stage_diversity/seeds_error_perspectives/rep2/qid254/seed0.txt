A specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the presence of the number **0** in the dataset, which triggers a misconception regarding whether a zero value "counts" as an item in the denominator.

**The "Zero-Exclusion" Misconception (Option C):**
Many students treat the number $0$ as "nothing" rather than a valid data point. When calculating the mean, they may correctly sum the numbers ($1+3+4+7 = 15$) but then mistakenly divide by **4** instead of **5**. This occurs because they intuitively count the number of "active" or non-zero values rather than the total number of observations. Option C acts as a "calculated distractor" for this specific conceptual error.

**The Contrast with Option A:**
Conversely, students who understand that the zero must be accounted for in the denominator ($n=5$) may still be tripped up by the notation in Option A. Because adding $0$ does not change the numerator's total ($0+1+3+4+7 = 1+3+4+7$), Option A is mathematically equivalent to the correct mean calculation. A student might find this difficult because they expect to see the $+0$ explicitly written out to confirm the count of five numbers; seeing only four numbers in the numerator might lead them to wrongly reject A and select D.
