One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conceptual status of zero as a placeholder in the divisor**, leading many to choose Option C.

In mean calculation problems, students often use a primitive heuristic: "Sum the numbers that have value and divide by how many there are." Because $0$ does not change the sum (the numerator), many students psychologically "discard" it from the set. This leads to two specific cognitive hurdles in this question:

1.  **Cardinality Error:** When counting the items to determine the divisor ($n$), students visually scan for "entities." A zero is frequently perceived as an "absence" rather than a data point. This makes **Option C ($\frac{\text{sum}}{4}$)** a highly attractive distractor, as students assume they should only divide by the four "active" numbers ($1, 3, 4, 7$).
2.  **Apparent Incorrectness of the Correct Answer:** Option A is actually the correct method, yet many students will reject it because they do not see the "$+ 0$" in the numerator. A student who strictly follows the "Sum of all terms" rule may feel Option A is "missing a piece" and choose "None of them" or "C" instead.

This "Zero-is-Nothing" misconception transforms a simple arithmetic task into a conceptual test of whether the student views a dataset as a collection of magnitudes (where zero is irrelevant) or a collection of observations (where zero is essential).
