One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **failure to transition from additive to multiplicative logic when processing the sign.**

Specifically, students often succumb to the **"sign-association" error**, where the visual presence of two minus signs triggers an "adding negatives" mental model rather than the rules for multiplication. 

Even if a student correctly identifies that the operation is multiplication ($1 \times 4 = 4$), their working memory often defaults to "$-1$ and $-4$ makes $-5$" because they perceive the two negative signs as a cumulative debt or a movement further left on a number line. This makes **Option D ($-5$)** a particularly potent "distractor." The trap is that the student correctly identifies the two relevant terms but subconsciously switches the operation from multiplication to addition because they are preoccupied with "resolving" the two minus signs.
