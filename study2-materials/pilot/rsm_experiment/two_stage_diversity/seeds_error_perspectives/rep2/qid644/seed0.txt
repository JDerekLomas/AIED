A specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conflict between "multiplying" the terms (as directed by the expansion process) and "adding" them (as suggested by the visual layout).**

### The Cognitive Conflict
When expanding brackets, students frequently shift incorrectly from multiplication to addition once they focus on the individual constants. Even though the question explicitly asks what happens when she *multiplies* the terms, a significant number of students will look at $-1$ and $-4$ and intuitively "combine" them to reach **Option D (-5)**.

This error is more likely here because of three specific factors:
1.  **The Absence of a Coefficient:** Unlike the first terms ($2p \times 3p = 6p^2$), there are no variables attached to these constants to "force" the student into a multiplication mindset. Without the $p$, the terms look like a simple arithmetic string: $-1 - 4$.
2.  **Directional Overload:** In the FOIL method or grid method, the "Last" terms are often calculated after the student has already performed three other multiplications. This cognitive fatigue often leads students to default to basic addition for the final pair of numbers.
3.  **Negative Integer Rules:** Even students who remember to multiply may struggle with the "negative times a negative" rule, potentially choosing **Option B (-4)** because they focus on the product of the digits ($1 \times 4$) but keep the negative sign from the original terms.

**Summary:** The most common specific trap is the "Addition Error," where the proximity of two negative constants triggers a sum calculation ($-1 + -4$) rather than a product calculation.
