A specific reason students find this question difficult is the **conflicting cognitive load between "multiplication rules" and "additive operations"** when dealing with negative integers.

Specifically, the "visual or notational trap" lies in the proximity of the numbers in the brackets, which can trigger an **incorrect mental operation of addition instead of multiplication.**

While a student may correctly identify that "negative and negative make a positive" (the sign rule), they often intuitively process the numbers -1 and -4 as a sum because they are used to combining terms in algebra. This leads them to the incorrect value of **-5** (Distractor D).

**Why this occurs:**
*   **The "Sign Dominance" Trap:** The student focuses so heavily on the fact that both numbers are negative that they mentally process them as "combining debts."
*   **Symbol Confusion:** Because the question asks for the product of -1 and -4, and both are at the "tail ends" of the binomials, the brain can lapse into simple arithmetic addition (-1 + -4 = -5) rather than applying the distributive property (multiplication) required by the instruction "expanding these brackets."

Even students who understand FOIL or the grid method often default to Distractor D or C (+5) because the cognitive effort required to maintain the "multiplication context" of the problem is temporarily overridden by the simpler, more automatic process of adding two small integers.
