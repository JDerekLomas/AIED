One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conflict between "multiplying" and the visual layout of the terms**, which leads to the **Addition Error (Option C).**

In the FOIL or distributive method, students are taught that the process of expanding brackets is an act of *multiplication*. However, because the numbers $-1$ and $-4$ are placed adjacent to each other within the context of the larger expression, many students intuitively revert to **integer addition**. 

Specifically, students see two negative numbers and "combine" them. Because the absolute values are small ($1$ and $4$), the mental jump to "five" is more immediate than the jump to "four." A student might correctly recall the rule that "two negatives make a positive" (the sign rule), but incorrectly apply it to the operation of addition: $-1 + (-4) = -5$, then misremembering that since they are "multiplying," they should change the sign to $+5$. This makes Option C a highly effective "distractor" that targets a failure to maintain operational discipline under the pressure of signed numbers.
