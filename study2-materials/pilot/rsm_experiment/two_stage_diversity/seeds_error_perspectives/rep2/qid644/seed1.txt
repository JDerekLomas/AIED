One specific reason students find this question difficult is the **conflict between "integer addition" and "term multiplication" logic** when dealing with two negative values.

In the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) or grid method, students often mentally juggle several operations simultaneously. When they identify the two terms $-1$ and $-4$, they correctly recognize that both numbers are negative, but their "number bond" intuition often overrides their "multiplicative" intuition.

Specifically, a student may fall into the trap of **Option D ($-5$)** because they apply the rule for **combining signed numbers (addition/subtraction)** rather than multiplying them. They see $-1$ and $-4$ and perform the calculation $-1 - 4$, resulting in $-5$. This error is exacerbated by the proximity of the terms in the expansion process, where students are mentally preparing to "collect like terms" (which involves addition/subtraction) even though this specific step requires multiplication. 

This is a **notational and operational trap**: the presence of two negative signs often triggers a "move further left on the number line" response rather than the "negative times negative equals positive" rule.
