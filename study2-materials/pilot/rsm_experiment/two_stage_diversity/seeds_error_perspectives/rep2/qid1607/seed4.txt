As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle in this question as the **"Inversion Sign Error"** specifically regarding additive vs. multiplicative operations in Step 2.

### The Specific Difficulty: The Misapplication of Additive Inversion

While students frequently successfully navigate the transition from the fraction in Step 1 to the linear form ($60 = 1 + k$) by multiplying, they often stumble on the final isolated operation due to **procedural interference**.

**The Logic of the Error:**
In Step 2, the equation is $60 = 1 + k$. To solve for $k$, a student must perform the *inverse* operation of adding 1, which is subtracting 1. However, students who choose "Both steps are correct" (Option C) often fall into one of two sub-traps:

1.  **Operation Generalization:** Because the student just moved from a division structure ($\frac{x}{4}$) to a multiplication step ($15 \times 4$), they are in a "cumulative mindset." Instead of looking at the sign attached to the constant (positive 1), they mentally group 60 and 1 and perform the "easiest" operation (addition) to arrive at 61.
2.  **Position-over-Operation (The "Side-Switch" Myth):** Many students learn the informal rule: *"Move it to the other side and change the sign."* If a student misidentifies the 1 as a $-1$ (due to its position to the left of the variable) or simply focuses on the "plus" sign and mentally assigns it to the outcome rather than the operation, they produce $60 + 1$.

**Why this specific question is a "trap":** 
The transition from Step 1 to Step 2 ($60$ to $61$) is numerically "smooth." Had Step 2 resulted in a nonsensical or highly complex number, the student might have paused. However, $61$ feels like a natural progression from $60$. This "procedural fluency" without "conceptual grounding" leads students to validate Isaac’s error because they see a logical sequence ($15 \to 60 \to 61$) rather than the specific mathematical requirement of balance (subtracting 1 from both sides).
