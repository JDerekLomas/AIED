One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a common **visual/notational trap involving the placement of the equals sign and the variable** in Step 2.

In algebra, students are frequently habituated to solving equations where the variable ends up on the left side (e.g., $k = 59$). When Isaac reaches Step 2 ($61 = k$), many students mentally default to the operation they most commonly associate with isolating a variable at the end of a problem—**addition**—especially since the previous step ended with $1+k$. 

Even though Step 1 correctly resulted in $60 = 1+k$, students often succumb to "operator fixation" in Step 2. They see the $60$ and the $1$ and reflexively add them to "finish" the problem ($60+1=61$), rather than performing the inverse operation ($60-1=59$) required to move the constant away from the $k$. Because the expression $1+k$ looks like a prompt for an addition sum rather than an equilibrium to be maintained, the "correct-looking" nature of the arithmetic ($60+1$ is indeed $61$) masks the algebraic error of failing to subtract. 

This leads students to select **Option A**, whereas those who simply see "61" and remember doing addition often mistakenly choose **Option C**.
