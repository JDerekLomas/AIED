One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **notational trap** regarding the **horizontal fraction bar as a grouping symbol.**

Students frequently fail to recognize that in the expression $\frac{1+k}{4}$, the horizontal bar acts as a vinculum, implicitly placing the numerator in parentheses: $(1+k)$. When a student successfully completes **Step 1** by multiplying by 4, they arrive at the linear form $60 = 1 + k$.

At this specific junction, a common "shortcut" error occurs: the student sees the $+1$ and, in a rush to isolate $k$, instinctively "combines" it with the $60$ using the operation they see performed on the right-hand side (addition) rather than the inverse operation (subtraction). Because $60$ and $1$ are "friendly numbers" that easily sum to $61$, the student experiences **cognitive closure**—the feeling that the math "looks right"—leading them to conclude that **Step 2** is correct. 

This is a specific "reverse operation error" where the presence of the $+$ sign in the numerator persists in the student's mind, causing them to add $1$ to both sides instead of subtracting it. Because Isaac’s Step 2 confirms this exact mistake, students often choose "Both steps are correct" (Option C) because it mirrors their own most likely procedural slip.
