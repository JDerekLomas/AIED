One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **"balancing bias" involving inverse operations in Step 2.**

When moving from \(60 = 1 + k\) to \(61 = k\), students often succumb to the "change-the-side, change-the-sign" rule, but they apply it to the wrong number or operation due to the visual proximity of the numbers. 

Specifically, many students recognize that Step 1 used multiplication (the inverse of division), and their mental "momentum" suggests that Step 2 should also involve an operation to "combine" the constant on the left with the constant on the right. Because they see a \(60\) and a \(1\), they perform the addition \(60 + 1\) instinctively, failing to recognize that to isolate \(k\), they must apply the **additive inverse** (\(-1\)) to both sides. 

The notation \(1 + k\) is particularly tricky here because it is a "right-handed" equation (where the variable is on the right). Many students are more comfortable with \(k + 1 = 60\); when the constant is positioned first (\(1 + k\)), students may fail to see the "+" as belonging to the \(k\) and instead view the whole right side as a prompt to "add 1 to the other side," leading them to conclude that Step 2 is correct when it is actually where the error occurs.
