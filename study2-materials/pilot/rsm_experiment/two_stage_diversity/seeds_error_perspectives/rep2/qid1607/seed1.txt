One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **misinterpretation of inverse operations in Step 2**, specifically triggered by the visual arrangement of the equation.

In Step 1, the student correctly multiplies by 4 to get $60 = 1 + k$. However, in Step 2, a common cognitive trap occurs: the student sees the number **1** and the number **60**, and because they are moving the "1" to the other side of the equals sign, their brain defaults to the operation most visually associated with "combining" these numbers to move forward—**addition**. 

This is a specific instance of "operation perseveration" or "additive bias." Because $60 + 1$ is a more "natural" or "satisfying" computation than $60 - 1$, and because the "+" sign is physically sitting next to the $k$, students often perform $60 + 1$ instead of subtracting 1 to isolate the variable. The presence of the value "61" in option B and C acts as a "lure," validating the intuitive but incorrect calculation.
