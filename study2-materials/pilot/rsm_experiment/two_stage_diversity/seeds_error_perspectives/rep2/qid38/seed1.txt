One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **failure to recognize the proportional relationship between the denominators**, leading to a common error where they perform unnecessary operations that result in Incorrect Option B.

Specifically, students often default to a "cross-multiplication" or "butterfly" method ($\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad+bc}{bd}$) rather than finding the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM). In this problem:

1.  **The Step:** A student may multiply the two denominators together to get a new common denominator of $2x^2$. 
2.  **The Error:** After reaching $\frac{3x + 8x}{2x^2} = \frac{11x}{2x^2}$, they must then simplify by canceling an $x$. 
3.  **The Visual Trap:** Many students forget to simplify the resulting $x^2$ term or, even more commonly, they **add the coefficients but add the variables** in the denominator (thinking $2x + x = 3x$). This leads directly to Option B ($\frac{3+4}{2x+x} = \frac{7}{3x}$).

The presence of the $2$ in only one denominator acts as a "notational trap." Students who are comfortable with numeric fractions like $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}$ know to only change one fraction; however, the presence of the algebraic $x$ often triggers a "procedure-heavy" response where the student feels they must multiply everything together, significantly increasing the likelihood of an algebraic simplification error.
