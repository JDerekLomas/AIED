One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **failure to recognize that $2x$ is a multiple of $x$**, leading to an unnecessary and error-prone "cross-multiplication" strategy.

While the simplest way to solve the problem is to multiply $\frac{4}{x}$ by $\frac{2}{2}$ to get $\frac{8}{2x}$, many students are taught a "butterfly" or "cross-product" method as a universal rule for adding fractions (i.e., $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad+bc}{bd}$). 

When applying this shortcut here:
1.  **Algebraic Overhead:** They multiply the denominators to get a new denominator of $2x^2$. 
2.  **Increased Complexity:** They calculate the numerator as $(3 \cdot x) + (4 \cdot 2x) = 11x$.
3.  **The "Simplification Gap":** The student arrives at $\frac{11x}{2x^2}$. Unlike the simpler method, this result requires an extra step of algebraic cancellation. Students often fail to see that $x$ can be divided out of both the numerator and the denominator, or they mistakenly cancel only one $x$ from the bottom, leading to the common incorrect "notational trap" of keeping an $x^2$ or failing to reach Option A. 

This specific shortcut creates a **higher "cognitive load"** than necessary, turning a basic common denominator problem into a multi-step algebraic simplification task.
