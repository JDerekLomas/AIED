A significant number of students will likely select **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$)** due to the common misconception of **"add-across-the-bottom"** thinking.

The specific difficulty here lies in the **non-numeric visual cues** of the denominators. In basic numeric fractions like $\frac{3}{2} + \frac{4}{1}$, students are often reminded that denominators are different because $2$ and $1$ look distinct. However, in this problem, the shared variable $x$ creates a "false sense of commonality." 

Students frequently treat the $x$ as a label rather than a value, leading to this specific sequence of errors:
1.  **Numerator addition:** They add $3 + 4$ to get $7$.
2.  **Denominator "Merging":** Because both denominators contain an $x$, they treat the $2$ and the (implied) $1$ in front of the second $x$ as numbers to be summed, resulting in $2+1=3$.
3.  **Result:** They combine these to reach $\frac{7}{3x}$.

This error is exacerbated by the **lack of a visible coefficient** in the second term. In the fraction $\frac{4}{x}$, the coefficient is an "invisible" $1$. Students who struggle with algebraic notation often fail to recognize that the second denominator needs to be scaled by a factor of $2$ to match $2x$. Instead of multiplying the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$, they apply the additive logic used in whole numbers directly to the algebraic denominators.
