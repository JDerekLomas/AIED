As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the **omission of the factor 2 when equalising the denominators** as the primary reason why students might find this question difficult, specifically leading them to incorrect Option D.

### The Specific Difficulty: "Numerator-Only" Focus
Students often recognise that they need a "common denominator," but they frequently suffer from a procedural shortcut error where they manipulate the denominator without applying the same operation to the numerator.

**The process where the error occurs:**
1.  The student identifies that to make the second fraction ($\frac{4}{x}$) match the first ($\frac{3}{2x}$), the denominator $x$ must become $2x$.
2.  The student mentally "appends" the $2$ to the bottom but fails to treat the fraction as a balanced ratio. Instead of multiplying the entire fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$, they simply treat the operation as "addition of the tops over the new common bottom."
3.  **The Calculation:** They perform $3 + 4 = 7$ and place it over the denominator $2x$.

**Why this is a specific "notational trap":**
In problems where denominators are purely numerical (e.g., $\frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{2}$), students are more accustomed to finding a Least Common Multiple. However, when the denominator contains a variable ($x$), students often view the "$2$" in $2x$ as a "tag" or a label rather than a multiplier. They focus on making the "labels" look the same and simply sum the coefficients of the numerators, leading directly to the attractor **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$)**.

This question is difficult because it tests whether the student understands that the **value** of the numerator is dependent on the scaling of the denominator, rather than just the visual alignment of the bottom terms.
