One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **failure to account for the coefficient when identifying the least common denominator**, leading them to incorrectly select **Option B**.

In numeric fractions (e.g., $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{1}$), students intuitively know they cannot just add the denominators. However, the presence of the algebraic variable $x$ in both denominators of $\frac{3}{2x}$ and $\frac{4}{x}$ often triggers a "visual matching" heuristic. Students see an $x$ in both positions and mistakenly conclude that the denominators are already "the same kind of thing." 

This leads to a specific procedural error:
1. They ignore the coefficient $2$ in the first fraction.
2. They add the numerators ($3 + 4 = 7$).
3. They mistakenly add the "hidden" coefficients or treat the $2$ as an irrelevant part of the label, sometimes resulting in a denominator of $3x$ (treating it as $2x + x = 3x$). 

This "notational trap" occurs because the algebraic notation masks the fact that the first denominator is **double** the second. Students who struggle with the distributive property of multiplication over variables often fail to see that $\frac{4}{x}$ must be scaled by $\frac{2}{2}$ to reach the common denominator of $2x$, making them highly susceptible to the "add across" error reflected in the distractors.
