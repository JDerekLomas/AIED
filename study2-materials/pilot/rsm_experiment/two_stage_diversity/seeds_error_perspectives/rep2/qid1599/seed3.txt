One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual trap of the "reciprocal error" in fraction placement**, leading them to choose **Option D**.

Students often learn the fraction bar as a replacement for the division sign $(\div)$ at the same time they are learning how to divide fractions (where they "flip" the second term). Because the expression $(h+4)$ contains two terms and a set of parentheses, it carries more "visual weight" than the single variable $c$. 

In the cognitive process of translating horizontal notation to vertical notation, a common error is to place the more "complex" part of the expression on the bottom automatically, or conversely, to mistakenly apply the "keep-change-flip" rule even when it is not a fraction-by-fraction division. This leads a student to perceive the relationship correctly (division) but map the **dividend** and **divisor** to the numerator and denominator incorrectly, swapping the roles of $c$ and $(h+4)$.
