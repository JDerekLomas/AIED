One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "left-to-right" placement trap**, which often leads to the selection of **Option D**.

In arithmetic, students are conditioned to read from left to right. When transitioning to algebraic fractions, they must learn to map the horizontal sequence (dividend $\div$ divisor) onto a vertical spatial arrangement (numerator over denominator). 

A common misconception occurs when a student focuses on the "weight" or complexity of the expression. Because $(h+4)$ contains two terms and a set of parentheses, it occupies more visual space than the single variable $c$. This can cause a "top-heavy" bias where students instinctively place the more complex part of the expression on top, or they may simply misalign the mapping of the dividend to the numerator. In Option D, the terms appear in a flipped vertical orientation ($\frac{\text{divisor}}{\text{dividend}}$), a classic reversal error for students who have not yet solidified the rule that the term *preceding* the division sign must become the numerator.
