One specific reason students find this question difficult is the **visual "overhang" trap** regarding the length of the fraction bar in distractors **A** and **C**.

In algebra, the fraction bar (vinculum) acts as a grouping symbol, similar to parentheses. Students often struggle to translate the physical length of the horizontal line into a logical priority of operations.

Specifically, a common error is failing to distinguish between:
*   **The intended expression (A):** Where the vinculum extends under the entire $+4$.
*   **The visual distractor (C):** Where the vinculum stops after the $h$, leaving the $+4$ "hanging" outside.

Many students view these expressions holistically rather than structurally. They may identify the correct characters ($c, h,$ and $4$) and a fraction bar but fail to "decode" the vinculum as a replacement for the parentheses. A student who correctly understands that $c$ is the dividend but misses the structural significance of the bar’s length will see A and C as virtually interchangeable, often defaulting to C because it mimics the linear left-to-right order of the original expression ($c$ then $h$ then $4$).
