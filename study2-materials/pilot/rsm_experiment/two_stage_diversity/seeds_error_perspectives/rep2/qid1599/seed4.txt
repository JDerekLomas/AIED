One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual trap of "Denominator vs. Numerator" order (Option D)**, which stems from the direction of reading in horizontal versus vertical notation.

In the original expression $c \div (h+4)$, the variable $c$ appears on the left. Many students rely on a "left-to-right" reading habit. However, when translating to a fraction, the "divisor" (the term following the $\div$ symbol) must become the denominator. 

Students often struggle with the "visual flip" required to place the $(h+4)$ underneath the $c$. Because $(h+4)$ contains two characters and a symbol, it has more "visual weight" than the single letter $c$. Students frequently default to placing the "heavier" or more complex expression on the bottom (which is correct here) or, conversely, may be tempted by **Option D** because they incorrectly associate the dividend with the bottom of the fraction, especially if they have been conditioned by certain division algorithms where the larger expression sits "inside" or "below" a bracket. 

Furthermore, students who confuse the relationship between the fraction bar and the division sign often view the line simply as a separator, failing to realize that **spatial orientation encodes the hierarchy of operations**. Option D acts as a "reversal error" trap for students who understand that the expression needs to be a fraction but have not mastered the directional mapping from $\text{Dividend} \div \text{Divisor}$ to $\frac{\text{Dividend}}{\text{Divisor}}$.
