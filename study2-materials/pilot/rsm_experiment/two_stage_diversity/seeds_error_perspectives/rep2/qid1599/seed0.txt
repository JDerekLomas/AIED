One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual trap of the grouping symbols in the denominator**, leading them to choose Option C.

In algebra, the vinculum (the horizontal fraction bar) acts as an implicit grouping symbol. Students frequently struggle to translate the explicit parentheses in \( c \div (h+4) \) into this implicit form. Because they see the "\( +4 \)" at the end of the linear expression, they may incorrectly apply a **"left-to-right" transcription rule**, writing the division \( c \div h \) as the fraction \( \frac{c}{h} \) and simply appending the "\( +4 \)" outside of it.

This error is compounded by the fact that the parentheses disappear in the fractional notation. A student who does not fully grasp that the fraction bar "encloses" everything below it will perceive Option C as a more literal, direct translation of the original string of symbols.
