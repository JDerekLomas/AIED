As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **common error of "Add-Across" denominator logic**—specifically facilitated by the construction of distractor **Option D**—as a primary reason students find this question difficult.

### The Specific Difficulty: "Fractional Misconception of Addition"

The most common hurdle here is the intuition that adding fractions should follow the same rules as multiplying them or adding whole numbers: operating on the numerators and denominators independently.

**The specific step where students go wrong:**
Students will add the whole numbers $(2 + 2 = 4)$ and then simply add the numerators $(7 + 1 = 8)$ and the denominators $(10 + 4 = 14)$. This leads them directly to $4 \frac{8}{14}$.

**Why this feature makes the error more likely:**
1.  **Reinforcement of Misconceptions:** Option D is a "lure" that validates a common procedural shortcut. When a student performs this incorrect operation and sees their exact result listed as an option, it provides a false sense of security, preventing them from checking their work or considering the need for a Common Denominator (LCD).
2.  **Notational Trap:** The mixed-number notation can sometimes mask the relationship between the fractional parts. Students who treat the fractions as two separate whole-number components ($7+1$ and $10+4$) fail to recognize that $\frac{7}{10}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$ represent different "unit sizes."
3.  **Complexity of LCD vs. Addition:** To reach the correct answer (B), a student must execute a multi-step retrieval process: find the LCD of 10 and 4 (20), convert both fractions ($14/20$ and $5/20$), add them ($19/20$), and rejoin the whole numbers. Compared to the one-step "add-across" method, the cognitive load is significantly higher, making the path of least resistance (Option D) highly attractive.

In summary, the question is difficult because it allows for a "surface-level" procedural success that results in one of the provided answers, bypassing the necessary (but more complex) conceptual step of equalizing denominators.
