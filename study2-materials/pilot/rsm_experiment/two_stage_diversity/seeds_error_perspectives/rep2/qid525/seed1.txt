One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "addition trap" present in Distractor D**, which triggers a common intuitive error known as **independent component addition**.

When adding mixed numbers, students who lack a firm grasp of common denominators often default to treating the whole numbers, numerators, and denominators as isolated integers. This leads them to perform the following operation:
1.  Add the whole numbers: $2 + 2 = 4$
2.  Add the numerators: $7 + 1 = 8$
3.  Add the denominators: $10 + 4 = 14$

This results in the answer **$4 \frac{8}{14}$**. 

The inclusion of this specific distractor makes the question more difficult because it provides **immediate surface-level reinforcement** for a flawed procedural shortcut. Because $4 \frac{8}{14}$ looks "correct" based on the simple addition of the digits visible in the problem, a student is likely to stop their cognitive processing once they see their incorrect result reflected in the options, bypassing the necessary (and more difficult) step of finding a least common multiple for the denominators.
