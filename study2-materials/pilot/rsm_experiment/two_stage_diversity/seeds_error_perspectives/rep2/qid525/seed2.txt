As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify a specific difficulty related to the **"notational trap" of Option D**, which results from a common procedural error known as **across-the-board addition.**

### The Specific Difficulty: The Add-Across Strategy
Many students, particularly those in the transitional phase between whole-number arithmetic and rational number arithmetic, struggle with the "freshman's error" of treating numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers. 

**The error process:**
1.  Add the whole numbers: $2 + 2 = 4$.
2.  Add the numerators: $7 + 1 = 8$.
3.  Add the denominators: $10 + 4 = 14$.
4.  Result: $4 \frac{8}{14}$ (Option D).

### Why this specific feature is powerful:
*   **Intuitive Interference:** Students often have a strong "intuitive rule" that an operation applied to a whole should be applied to all its parts. Because addition is associative and commutative with whole numbers, the brain seeks a shortcut that avoids the cognitively demanding task of finding a Least Common Multiple (LCM). 
*   **Presence as a Distractor:** By including $4 \frac{8}{14}$ as a choice, the question validates this incorrect intuition. A student who is unsure of the common denominator algorithm will perform the "simplest" addition ($7+1$ and $10+4$), see their result reflected exactly in the options, and experience a false sense of "fluency" that prevents them from checking their work.
*   **Visual Mimicry:** The notation of fractions ($ \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} $) visually mimics the setup of whole-number vertical addition, leading students to bypass the conceptual meaning of the denominator (the size of the pieces) in favor of treating it as a raw count.

In this specific problem, Option D acts as a "magnetic" distractor because it requires the least amount of mental transformation compared to the multi-step process of converting to twentieths.
