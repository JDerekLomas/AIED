As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **"Add-Across" error pattern in Option D** as a specific point of difficulty and a high-probability distractor.

**The specific aspect: Fraction addition by independent component summation.**

When students encounter mixed numbers, they often rely on an intuitive "concatenation" strategy: adding whole numbers to whole numbers and numerators to numerators. 

**Why this occurs here:**
1.  **Direct Alignment:** The question presents the fractions side-by-side ($ \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} $). A student who lacks a conceptual understanding of the need for a common denominator will perform the operation: $7 + 1 = 8$ (numerator) and $10 + 4 = 14$ (denominator).
2.  **Structural Seduction:** Adding the whole numbers ($2 + 2 = 4$) feels successful and complete, leading the student to append the "added" fraction parts to create **$4 \frac{8}{14}$**.
3.  **Bypassing the Least Common Multiple (LCM):** Calculating the LCM of 10 and 4 requires an extra cognitive step. Option D provides an "immediate" path that avoids the labor of finding twentieths, making it a very tempting trap for students with low procedural fluency or high cognitive load.

Even though $ \frac{8}{14} $ can be simplified, many students stop at the first result they calculate. Option D is specifically designed to catch students who apply the logic of multiplication (multiplying across) to the operation of addition.
