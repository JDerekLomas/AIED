One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **misapplication of the "add across" strategy for fractions with different denominators**, leading them to choose Option D.

Specifically, many students successfully add the whole numbers ($2 + 2 = 4$) but then treat the numerators and denominators as independent integers. Instead of finding a common denominator, they perform:
$$\frac{7+1}{10+4} = \frac{8}{14}$$

This results in the answer $4 \frac{8}{14}$. This error is particularly persistent because:
1.  **Instructional Interference:** The rule for multiplication (multiplying across) is often misgeneralized to addition.
2.  **Ease of Computation:** Adding $7+1$ and $10+4$ is cognitively less demanding than finding the least common multiple of $10$ and $4$ (which is $20$) and converting the numerators.
3.  **Visual Trap:** Option D "looks" correct to a struggling student because every digit in the answer is a direct sum of the digits present in the original expression, providing a false sense of logic.
