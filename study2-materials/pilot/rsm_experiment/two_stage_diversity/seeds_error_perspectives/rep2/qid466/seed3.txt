One specific reason students often find this question difficult is **sign interference between the reciprocal operation and the rules of multiplication.**

Specifically, students who correctly identify that they need the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$ (which is $\frac{4}{3}$) often erroneously believe that "flipping" a fraction also requires "flipping" its sign (changing it from negative to positive). This is driven by a confusion between two different additive/multiplicative inverse properties:

1.  **Additive Inverse logic:** "To get to zero, I change the sign."
2.  **Multiplicative Inverse logic:** "To get to one, I flip the numerator and denominator."

In this problem, a student may correctly identify that the target is $-1$, but then incorrectly reason that because the original number is negative, the multiplier must be positive to "cancel out" the negative sign. They overlook that the product is itself negative, meaning an odd number of negative factors is required. This makes **Distractor A ($\frac{4}{3}$)** a highly attractive "near-miss" error for students who understand the magnitude of the required value but fail to coordinate the signs.
