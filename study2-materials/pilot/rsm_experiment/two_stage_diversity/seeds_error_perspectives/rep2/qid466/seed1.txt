One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **misapplication of the "additive inverse" (opposite) rule** when the target product is $-1$.

Students frequently internalize the rule that to "get to zero," they must add the opposite (e.g., $-\frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = 0$). When presented with $-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$, a student may subconsciously focus on the negative sign and the "one-ness" of the identity and choose **Option A ($ \frac{4}{3} $)** because they correctly identify the reciprocal needed to get a value of 1, but incorrectly assume they need to flip the sign (to positive) to "balance" or cancel out the original negative sign. 

They confuse the rule for **additive inverses** (where signs must be opposite) with the rule for **multiplicative inverses** (where signs must be identical to result in a positive product). Because the target here is $-1$ rather than $1$, the student must recognize that a positive multiplier is required to keep the product negative—a counter-intuitive step for those who equate "finding the inverse" with "changing the sign."
