One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **misapplication of the "multiplicative inverse" rule regarding the negative sign.**

Students often correctly recall that to "cancel out" a fraction and get $1$, they need to multiply by the reciprocal (flipping the fraction). However, a common misconception exists where students conflate the rule for **reciprocals** (multiplicative inverse) with the rule for **opposites** (additive inverse).

Specifically:
*   **The Trap:** Many students believe that because the reciprocal "flips" the numbers, it must also "flip" the sign from negative to positive. They incorrectly think that a negative number needs a positive partner to reach a "clean" integer result like $1$.
*   **The Error:** A student may identify that $\frac{4}{3}$ is the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$, but because the target is $-1$, they mistakenly choose **Option A ($4/3$)**. They think: *"The problem is already negative, and the target is negative, so I just need the fraction that makes it equal 1."* They fail to account for the fact that a negative times a positive is negative, whereas a negative times a negative would result in $+1$.

This makes **Option A** a highly effective distractor for students who understand the magnitude of the reciprocal but have an unstable grasp of the **sign laws for multiplication**, particularly when combined with the cognitive load of fraction operations.
