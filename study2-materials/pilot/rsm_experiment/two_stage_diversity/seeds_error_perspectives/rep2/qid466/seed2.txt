As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **management of the product's sign in the presence of an identity element** as the specific hurdle for this question.

Specifically, many students struggle with the **Sign-Parity Rule of Multiplication** when the target result is a negative number ($-1$). 

**The Difficulty: The "Cancelation" Misconception**
Students often associate the process of finding a reciprocal to "cancel out" a fraction with the goal of reaching **positive 1** (the multiplicative identity). Because they see a negative sign in the problem ($-\frac{3}{4}$) and a negative sign in the answer ($-1$), they may intuitively feel that the negative sign has "already been accounted for."

*   **The Error:** A student may reason, *"I have a negative, and I want a negative, so the star must be a positive number to keep it that way."* This leads them to choose **A ($\frac{4}{3}$)**. 
*   **The Conflict:** This error occurs because students often over-generalize the "two negatives make a positive" rule. If they are used to solving for $+1$ (where they would need to choose $-\frac{4}{3}$), they may instinctively switch to a positive value here without correctly applying the algebraic logic that a negative times a positive equals a negative.

**Summary:** The presence of the negative sign in the product ($-1$) acts as a "distractor" that disrupts the standard reciprocal procedure. It forces students to choose between the **magnitude** of the number (reciprocal) and the **sign property**, and they often fail to coordinate both simultaneously when the result is not the standard positive identity.
