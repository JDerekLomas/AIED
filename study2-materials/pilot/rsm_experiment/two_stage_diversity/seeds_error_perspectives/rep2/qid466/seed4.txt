As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **sign-multiplication rule for identity** as a specific feature that makes this question difficult, specifically leading to the common error of choosing **Option B** instead of Option A.

**The "Negative × Negative = Positive" Trap:**
Students who have recently mastered the rule that "a negative times a negative equals a positive" often overgeneralize this procedure whenever they see multiple negative signs in an equation. In this problem, the student sees a negative sign in the fraction ($-\frac{3}{4}$) and a negative sign in the result ($-1$). 

Their logic often follows this path:
1. They correctly identify that the numerical value needed is the reciprocal ($\frac{4}{3}$) to get a magnitude of 1.
2. They see two minus signs already present in the "frame" of the problem (one in the term, one in the product). 
3. Because they are conditioned to associate "two negatives" with "the correct answer," they instinctively reach for a **third negative** (Option B) to maintain the "negative theme" of the problem, or they mistakenly apply the rule as: *"I want the answer to be negative, and since I started with a negative, I must need another negative."*

In reality, since the product remains negative, only one of the factors can be negative. The student must realize that the "negative" property has already been "used" by the first fraction. This requires a level of **metacognitive inhibition**—the ability to stop the automatic impulse to match signs—which is a high-level cognitive hurdle for middle-school learners.
