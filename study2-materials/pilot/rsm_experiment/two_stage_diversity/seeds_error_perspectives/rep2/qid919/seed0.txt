A primary reason students find this question difficult is a **misplaced order of operations regarding the exponent**, specifically choosing option **B ($0.27$)** due to a "Left-to-Right" execution error.

### The Specific Step: Squaring vs. Multiplying
Students frequently interpret $3x^2$ as $(3x)^2$. This is a documented cognitive trap where students apply operations in the visual order they appear (left-to-right) rather than according to the hierarchy of operations (indices before multiplication).

**The Error Path for Option B:**
1.  **Premature Multiplication:** The student first calculates $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$.
2.  **Delayed Squaring:** They then square the result: $0.9^2 = 0.81$. 
    *Wait—looking at option B, some students perform $3 \times (0.3^2)$ but calculate $0.3^2$ as $0.9$, or conversely, they multiply $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then multiply by $0.3$ again (effectively $3x \cdot x$) but misplace the decimal point.* 

### The Notational Trap: The Coefficient and the Decimal
The difficulty is exacerbated by the **interaction between the coefficient ($3$) and the decimal input ($0.3$)**. 
*   Because both numbers contain a "3," students often fall into "number poaching," where they intuitively feel the answer must involve the digits 2 and 7 (from $3^3$). 
*   A student who correctly identifies that the calculation involves $3$ and $0.09$ may still select **Option D ($2.7$)** if they struggle with decimal placement, erroneously believing that $3 \times 0.09$ is $2.7$ instead of $0.27$.

In summary, the specific difficulty lies in **protecting the exponent from the coefficient**, a task made harder here because the proximity of the "3" in the formula and the "0.3" in the table encourages a mental shortcut to treat the problem as $0.3^3$ or $(3 \times 0.3)^2$, leading directly to the distractors.
