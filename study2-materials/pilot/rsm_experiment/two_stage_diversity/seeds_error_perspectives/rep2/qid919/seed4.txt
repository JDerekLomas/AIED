As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the **misapplication of the "decimal multiplication" rule regarding decimal places** as the specific reason many students find this question difficult, leading them to the distractor **(B) 0.27**.

### The Specific Step: Squaring $0.3$
The primary conceptual hurdle is calculating $(0.3)^2$. Students frequently use a "pattern-matching" shortcut: they multiply the significant figures ($3 \times 3 = 9$) but fail to correctly place the decimal.

There are two common cognitive traps here:
1.  **Additive Place Value Error:** Students incorrectly believe that because $0.3$ has *one* decimal place, the squared result must also have only *one* decimal place ($0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$). 
2.  **Order of Operations / Scaling Error:** If a student calculates $y = 3 \times 0.3^2$, they may process the $3$ and the first $0.3$ first ($3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$) and then multiply by the second $0.3$. Even then, the transition from $0.9 \times 0.3$ to **$0.27$** is the most "attractive" error. 

### Why $0.27$ is a "Lure"
The answer **$0.27$** is a highly effective distractor because it "looks right" to a student who has performed a partial calculation correctly but lacks decimal fluency. The digits "2" and "7" come from the product $3 \times 3 \times 3$. Because $0.3$ is a "small" number, students instinctively feel the answer should be a "small" decimal. 

While the correct answer (0.27) actually *is* the value for this specific equation, the difficulty lies in the fact that **many students arrive at $0.27$ via an incorrect path.** They treat $(3x)^2$ or simply multiply the coefficients and the variable as $3 \times 0.3 \times 3 = 2.7$ or $3 \times 3 \times 0.3 = 2.7$, and then attempt to adjust the decimal at the very end based on intuition rather than rule-following.

**Conclusion:** The trap is the **conceptual blur between squaring a decimal and multiplying by a whole number coefficient.** A student might see "three, three, and three" and choose $0.27$ because it contains those factors, regardless of whether they actually squared the $x$ or just multiplied all visible numbers together ($3 \times 0.3 \times 0.3$).
