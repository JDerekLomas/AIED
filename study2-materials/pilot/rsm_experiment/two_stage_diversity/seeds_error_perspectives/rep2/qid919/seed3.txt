One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conflict between the order of operations ($BIDMAS/PEMDAS$) and the left-to-right reading habit**, specifically regarding the squaring of a decimal.

In the expression $y = 3x^2$, students frequently succumb to the **"Linear Multiplier Trap."** Instead of squaring the $x$ value first, they perform the operation $(3 \times 0.3)^2$.

Because the leading coefficient (3) and the input value (0.3) share the same significant digit, the multiplication feels "natural" and yields a deceptively clean result:
1. Student calculates $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$.
2. Student then squares the result: $0.9^2 = 0.81$.

This leads them directly to **Distractor A**, which acts as a "confirmation bias" trap. Students often perceive $0.81$ as a more "stable" or likely answer than the correct $0.27$ because they frequently struggle with the place value displacement that occurs when squaring a decimal ($0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$). By incorrectly multiplying by the coefficient first, they arrive at a number that feels more familiar, causing them to bypass the correct sequence of squaring $0.3$ first and then multiplying by $3$.
