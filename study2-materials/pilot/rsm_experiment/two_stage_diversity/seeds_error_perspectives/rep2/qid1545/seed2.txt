One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "Gestalt" trap created by the identical sequence of numbers.**

Research in mathematics education suggests that students often perceive mathematical expressions as visual strings before they process them as logical operations. In this specific question, both sides of the box contain the digits $8$, $12$, and $4$ in the exact same order, separated by the same operations ($+$ and $\div$).

Because the elements are identical and arranged in the same sequence, many students will default to a **"Surface Pattern Match."** They may conclude the answer is **C) $=$** based on visual symmetry alone, bypassing the computational rules of the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

The difficulty is heightened because the left-hand side ($8+12 \div 4$) is "notationaly clean"—it lacks the grouping symbols (parentheses) present on the right. Students who rely on a left-to-right processing strategy (treating math like reading a sentence) will often incorrectly calculate the left side as:
$(8 + 12) = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.

If a student makes this left-to-right error, they arrive at $5 = 5$, reinforcing the visual illusion that the expressions are equivalent. This creates a "perfect storm" of error where an incorrect visual heuristic and an incorrect procedural strategy both lead to the same wrong answer.
