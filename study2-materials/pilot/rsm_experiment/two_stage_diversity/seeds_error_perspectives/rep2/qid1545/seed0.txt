One specific reason students find this question difficult is a **visual trap involving the "order of operations" vs. the "order of reading."**

Specifically, students often succumb to the **Left-to-Right Priority Bias** on the left side of the expression: $8 + 12 \div 4$.

Because the addition ($8 + 12$) appears before the division ($ \div 4$) when reading from left to right, students frequently "pre-calculate" the addition first, treating the expression as $(8 + 12) \div 4$. This leads them to conclude that both sides are equal (Choice C), when in reality, the formal rules of MDAS (Multiplication/Division before Addition/Subtraction) require the division to be performed first.

**Why this is a concrete trap here:**
The numbers are intentionally chosen to be the same on both sides ($8, 12, 4$). On the right side, the parentheses explicitly group $8+12$. A student who lacks "operational flexibility" will see the identical string of numbers and—wishing to simplify their mental workload—assume the left side "must" be solved in the order it is written. This creates a false sense of symmetry, leading the student to overlook the lack of parentheses on the left and incorrectly identify the two expressions as equivalent.
