One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **"Visual Distillation" trap**, where students ignore the operation symbols and focus solely on the identical sequence of numbers ($8, 12, 4$) on both sides of the box.

Because the terms $8, 12,$ and $4$ appear in the exact same order on both the left and right sides, students often fall into the trap of **"Equivalence via Inspection."** They see the digits as a holistic set rather than a series of operations. Because both sides "contain the same stuff," a common intuitive leap is to select **C) $=$** without performing any calculation.

This error is compounded by a specific misunderstanding of the distributive property. A student might incorrectly assume that $(8+12) \div 4$ is just a "organized" way of writing $8+12 \div 4$, failing to recognize that in the first expression, the division only applies to the $12$, while in the second, the parentheses force the division to apply to the sum ($20$). The visual symmetry of the numbers acts as a "distractor" that prevents them from applying the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/PEMDAS).
