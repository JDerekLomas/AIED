One specific reason students find this question difficult is the **visual "Gestalt" trap of identical number sequences**, which triggers a common error in applying the distributive property.

### The Specific Difficulty: The Distributive Illusion
A student may see $8+12$ on both sides of the box and intuitively feel they should "do the same thing" to those numbers. Because the right side is written as $(8+12) \div 4$, students often assume the left side $8+12 \div 4$ is simply a "short-hand" or an un-bracketed version of the same calculation. 

**Where it goes wrong:**
The student’s eye is drawn to the $8+12$ on the left as a single unit because those same digits are grouped on the right. This leads to the **additive priority error**:
1.  On the left, they perform the addition first ($8+12=20$) then divide by 4, getting **5**.
2.  On the right, they follow the brackets ($8+12=20$) then divide by 4, getting **5**.
3.  They conclude the answer is **(C) $=$**.

### Why this happens here:
The use of the same two numbers ($8$ and $12$) and the same operation ($\div 4$) in the same linear order creates a **perceptual symmetry** that overpowers the formal rules of Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). In the student's mind, the division sign "at the end" is perceived as applying to the entire preceding expression on both sides, making the brackets appear redundant rather than restrictive. 

Correct application requires the student to actively "break" the visual pattern on the left to perform $12 \div 4$ first, which is counter-intuitive when the $8+12$ grouping is so explicitly suggested by the right-hand side.
