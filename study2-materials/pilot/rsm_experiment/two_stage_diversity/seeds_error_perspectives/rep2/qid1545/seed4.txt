One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "Gestalt" trap of the repeated digits**, which triggers an incorrect application of the distributive property.

### The Specific Error: False Distributivity
Students often see the numbers $8, 12,$ and $4$ repeated on both sides of the box and intuitively feel they are "equivalent" without processing the structural difference in grouping. This leads to a specific shortcut error: **Distributing the division into only one term on the left, but both on the right.**

*   **The Left Side ($8 + 12 \div 4$):** Many students subconsciously read this as "add then divide" because the numbers are written in a linear string, leading them to calculate $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$. 
*   **The Right Side ($(8+12) \div 4$):** Students see the parentheses and perform the exact same calculation: $20 \div 4 = 5$.

### Why this happens here:
The notation $12 \div 4$ at the end of the first expression creates a **"strong bond"** between those two numbers due to their proximity. A student who lacks a robust "Order of Operations" schema will prioritize the horizontal layout of the numbers over the hierarchy of operators. 

Because the expression on the right *visually confirms* the "natural" urge to add first (by using parentheses), the student assumes the expression on the left—which contains the exact same digits in the same order—must yield the same result. This leads to the incorrect choice of **C) \( = \)**, as the student fails to see that on the left, the $8$ remains "whole" while on the right, the $8$ is "shrunk" by the divisor.
