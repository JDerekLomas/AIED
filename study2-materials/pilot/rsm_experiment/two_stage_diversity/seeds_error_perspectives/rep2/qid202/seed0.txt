As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **common error of adding denominators** (Option D) as a specific point of difficulty caused by a **notational interference** with the rules of multiplication.

**The Specific Trap: Whole Number Processing Bias**
Students often struggle with this question because they apply a "consistent operation" logic across all visible components of the fraction. In their previous experience with whole number addition, you add every digit presented ($2+1=3$). When they encounter the fractions, the visual symmetry of the problem invites them to treat the numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers. 

**The Step Where They Go Wrong:**
Instead of viewing the "fifths" as a stable unit or denominator (the *size* of the pieces), students perceive them as operands. They correctly add the whole numbers ($2+1=3$) and the numerators ($1+2=3$), but then follow the established pattern of addition by adding the denominators ($5+5=10$). This leads them directly to the distractor **D: \(3 \frac{3}{10}\)**.

**Why this is a persistent difficulty:**
This error is particularly "sticky" because it mirrors the algorithm for **fraction multiplication**, where one *does* multiply both the numerators and the denominators. The student's brain misretrieves the "perform the operation on both levels" rule from multiplication and applies it to the addition context, failing to recognize that the denominator in addition represents the fixed "whole."
