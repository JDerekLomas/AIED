As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most specific point of difficulty in this question as the **"Denominator Summation Error" resulting in Option D.**

### The Specific Difficulty: "Additive Misconception of Fractions"
While this question appears straightforward due to the common denominators (both are 5), it triggers a persistent intuitive error: students often treat the numerator and denominator as independent whole numbers rather than a single ratio.

**The specific step where they go wrong:**
After successfully adding the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$), a student may apply the "add everything across" logic to the fractional parts. Instead of maintaining the denominator as a constant unit of measure, they perform:
$$\frac{1+2}{5+5} = \frac{3}{10}$$
This leads them directly to **Option D ($3 \frac{3}{10}$)**.

**Why this feature is a "trap":**
The presence of the same denominator ($5$) actually makes this error *more* likely for some students. In their experience with whole number addition, "more numbers" usually results in a larger result for both parts of a notation. To a novice, leaving the $5$ unchanged feels mathematically "incomplete," whereas adding it to get $10$ provides a sense of closure.

**The Notational Trap:**
The mixed number notation $2 \frac{1}{5}$ lacks a visible operator between the whole number and the fraction. This "hidden addition" ($2 + \frac{1}{5}$) can lead students to view the problem as four separate integers to be combined ($2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 5$), making the jump to adding the two $5$s into a $10$ more tempting than if the fractions were represented visually as area models or number lines.
