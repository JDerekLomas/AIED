One specific reason why students might find this question difficult relates to a **notational trap regarding the denominators during addition.**

Specifically, students often succumb to the **"Add-Everything" strategy**, where they treat the numerator and denominator as independent whole numbers. In this case, a student may correctly add the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and the numerators ($1 + 2 = 3$), but then erroneously add the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$). 

This leads them directly to **Distractor D ($3 \frac{3}{10}$)**. This error is highly likely because the symmetry of the problem—where every component ($2, 1, 1, 2$) is a small, basic digit—encourages a "matching" procedural mindset. Students who have not yet internalized that the denominator represents the *size* of the parts rather than a *count* of objects will treat the "5s" as terms to be combined rather than a common label for the fractional unit.
