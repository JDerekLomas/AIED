As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant "trap" in this question to be the **"Additive Denominator Error"** triggered by the specific notation of the fractions.

### The Specific Difficulty: Incorrect Denominator Summation (Distractor D)
Students frequently find this question difficult because of a common intuitive leap: applying the addition operation to all visible digits regardless of their position. While students may correctly add the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and the numerators ($1 + 2 = 3$), a significant number will proceed to add the denominators as well ($5 + 5 = 10$).

**Why this occurs in this specific context:**
1.  **Uniformity of Operation:** The notation $\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}$ presents four distinct numerals in a grid-like layout. Many students default to a "complete processing" strategy where they add the top row and then add the bottom row.
2.  **Reinforcement from Multiplication:** Students often over-generalize the rules of fraction multiplication (where you *do* multiply the denominators) to addition.
3.  **The Allure of Distractor D:** Option **D ($3 \frac{3}{10}$)** is specifically designed to catch this error. When students see "10" as an option, it provides "selection validation"—it confirms their incorrect calculation $(5+5)$, leading them to believe they have followed the correct procedure because their result matches an available answer.

**The Notational Trap:**
If this question were presented visually (e.g., using fraction circles or bars), the difficulty would decrease because the size of the "slices" (fifths) would clearly not change to "tenths" just by being pushed together. However, the purely symbolic notation of $\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}$ masks the conceptual meaning of the denominator as a *unit* (five-parts-of-a-whole) and treats it instead as an independent integer to be operated upon.
