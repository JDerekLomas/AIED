One specific reason why students might find this question difficult relates to a **notational trap regarding the denominators during addition.**

Specifically, students often succumb to the **"Add-Across" error**, where they treat the numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers. In this case, a student would correctly add the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and the numerators ($1 + 2 = 3$), but then erroneously add the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$).

This leads them directly to **Distractor D ($3 \frac{3}{10}$)**. 

The presence of the common denominator ($5$) is actually the source of the trap. In multiplication of fractions, students *are* required to multiply the denominators; students who have overgeneralized this rule—or who lack a conceptual understanding of denominators as the "size" of the parts—often feel a procedural impulse to perform an operation on every number visible in the expression. The result $3 \frac{3}{10}$ feels "correctly processed" to a student who believes that a math problem is only finished once every digit has been combined.
