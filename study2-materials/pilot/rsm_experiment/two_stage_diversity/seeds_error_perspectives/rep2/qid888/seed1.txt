One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **arithmetic of signed integers** during the final constant term multiplication.

Specifically, students often commit a "sign error" when multiplying **$-5$ by $-7$**. There is a common cognitive interference where the brain prioritizes the absolute values ($5 \times 7 = 35$) but incorrectly carries over the subtraction sign from the brackets, leading to a result of $-35$.

In this specific multiple-choice layout, this makes **Option D ($m^2 - 12m - 35$)** a high-functioning distractor. A student may correctly perform the "inner" and "outer" additions to get $-12m$ (recognizing that $-5 + -7 = -12$), but then inconsistently apply sign rules for the final step, mistakenly believing that "a negative and a negative stay negative" regardless of the operation. This confusion between the rules for *adding* negatives and *multiplying* negatives is a primary hurdle in expanding binomials with two subtraction signs.
