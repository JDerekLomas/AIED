A specific reason students find this question difficult is the **conflict between "additive sign rules" and "multiplicative sign rules" during the constant term calculation.**

Specifically, students often make the error seen in **Option D** ($m^2 - 12m - 35$) because of a cognitive interference known as **"sign persistence"** or "rule misapplication" when processing the $-5$ and $-7$.

### The Mechanics of the Error:
When expanding $(m-5)(m-7)$, a student performs two distinct operations involving the same two integers:
1.  **Addition (Linear term):** They calculate $(-5) + (-7)$ to get $-12$.
2.  **Multiplication (Constant term):** They calculate $(-5) \times (-7)$.

**The Difficulty:**
Because the student has just successfully applied the logic that "two negatives make a larger negative" (for the $-12m$), that momentum often carries over into the final step. The visual presence of two minus signs in the brackets leads the student to reflexively write a minus sign for the final product, resulting in $-35$ instead of $+35$.

### Why this is a "Notational Trap":
The structure of the question triggers a **consistency bias**. If the middle term is negative (which it is), students intuitively feel the final term should "match" the subtraction-heavy theme of the expression. **Option D** is a highly effective distractor because it satisfies the student's correct calculation of the $12$, while preying on the common lapse in applying the "negative times negative equals positive" rule immediately after having used a "negative plus negative" logic.
