A specific reason students find this question difficult is the **arithmetic of signed numbers in the final constant term**, specifically the "negative times a negative" rule.

While many students correctly apply the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) method to identify the terms $m^2, -7m, -5m,$ and $(5 \times 7)$, they frequently stumble on the sign of the constant:

*   **The specific error:** Students often carry the subtraction signs through to the multiplication but revert to an "addition-style" intuition, resulting in $-35$ instead of $+35$. They see two negatives and associate them with a negative outcome, leading them to select **Option D** ($m^2 - 12m - 35$).
*   **The visual trap:** In the expressions $(m-5)$ and $(m-7)$, the minus sign is visually dominant. A student who correctly calculates the middle term as $-12m$ (combining $-5$ and $-7$) may subconsciously maintain "subtraction consistency" across the entire trinomial, assuming that because the binomials were subtractions, the result should consist of subtractions. 

This makes the distinction between **Option B** (the correct answer) and **Option D** the primary psychological hurdle of the question, as it tests whether the student can decouple the additive property of the middle term from the multiplicative property of the final term.
