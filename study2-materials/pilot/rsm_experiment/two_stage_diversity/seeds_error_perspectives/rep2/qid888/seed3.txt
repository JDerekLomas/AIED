As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **handling of the product of two negative constants** (the constant term) as the primary area where students find this question difficult, specifically regarding the choice between **Options B and D**.

### The Specific Difficulty: The Signs of the "Last" Term
In the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) method, the "Last" step requires students to multiply $-5$ by $-7$. Students often fail this step due to a phenomenon called **Sign Processing Overload**.

When students compute the middle term $(m \times -7) + (-5 \times m)$, they correctly identify that they are working with negative values to get $-12m$. However, after performing several operations involving negative signs, a common cognitive slip occurs: they "carry over" the negative sign to the final product.

*   **The Trap:** Students recognize that the expression is dominated by minus signs. In Option D ($m^2 - 12m - 35$), the signs follow a pattern of "all negatives" which "feels" more consistent with the prompt $(m-5)(m-7)$ than the mathematically correct change to a positive constant in Option B ($+35$).

### Why Option D is the Most Effective Distractor:
A student may correctly add $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$ for the linear coefficient, but then **intellectually exhaust their focus on sign rules**. Because the operation of *addition* (used for the middle term) preserves the negative sign, students frequently apply that same logic to the *multiplication* of the constant terms, incorrectly concluding that a "negative times a negative must stay negative" in the context of a long expression.

Therefore, while a student might know in isolation that $-5 \times -7 = 35$, the **notational context** of distributive expansion often leads them to select Option D because it visually preserves the negative symbols seen in the brackets.
