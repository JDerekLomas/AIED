As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle in this question as the **"Sign Multiplication Rule" during the final constant term calculation ($-5 \times -7$).**

Specifically, students are prone to making an error during the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) process at the **"Last"** step. While many students correctly identify the "Middle" term by adding $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12m$, they frequently struggle with the product of two negative numbers.

### The Specific Difficulty: "Additive vs. Multiplicative Negative Logic"
The cognitive conflict occurs because the student must apply two different rules for negative signs in rapid succession:
1.  **For the middle term ($m$ term):** They must *combine* two negatives ($-5m - 7m$), where "negative plus a negative stays negative."
2.  **For the last term (constant):** They must *multiply* two negatives ($-5 \times -7$). 

**The Error Pattern:**
Students often carry the "staying negative" logic from the addition step over to the multiplication step. This leads them to conclude that $-5 \times -7 = -35$. Consequently, they choose **Option D ($m^{2} - 12m - 35$)**. 

This error is exacerbated by the "visual priming" of seeing two minus signs in the original brackets $(m-5)(m-7)$. A student may intuitively feel that the final expression should "stay" negative because the source components are negative, failing to flip the sign to positive ($+35$) as required by the laws of arithmetic. This is why **Option B** (the correct answer) is frequently missed in favor of **Option D**.
