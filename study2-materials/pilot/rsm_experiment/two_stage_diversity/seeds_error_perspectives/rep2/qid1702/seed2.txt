A significant reason students may find this question difficult is the **non-integer decimal value of $y$ ($0.5$) combined with the subtraction of a negative term during the solving process.**

Specifically, the difficulty lies in the step where students must evaluate $-6(0.5)$. While many students can handle $6 \times 0.5$ as "half of six," the negative sign often leads to one of two specific procedural traps:

1.  **The Subtraction/Negative Sign Confusion:** After substituting $y = 0.5$, the equation becomes $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, which simplifies to $10x - 3 = 30$. A common error at this stage is for students to see the subtraction sign and instinctively **subtract 3** from 30 rather than adding it, leading to $10x = 27$ and the incorrect answer **D ($2.7$)**.

2.  **Arithmetic Overshadowing Algebra:** Because $0.5$ is "friendly" in multiplication, students often focus on the $6 \times 0.5 = 3$ calculation and mentally discard the negative sign temporarily. When they "bring it back" to the equation, they often perform $10x = 30 - 3$ because they perceive the 3 as a positive value they generated, rather than a term being subtracted from $10x$.

**Why this makes the question hard:**
In many introductory "table of value" problems, the substitution involves a $0$ or a $1$, or the coefficient of $y$ is $+1$. Here, the combination of a negative coefficient ($-6$) and a decimal ($0.5$) forces the student to manage a multi-step transformation ($10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 33 \rightarrow x = 3.3$) where a single sign error at the start leads directly to one of the most plausible distractors.
