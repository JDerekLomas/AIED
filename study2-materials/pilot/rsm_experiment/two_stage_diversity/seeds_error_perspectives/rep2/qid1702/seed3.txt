As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle for students in this question as **the potential for a "sign error" during the two-step isolation process**, specifically when handling the subtraction of the constant.

### The Specific Difficulty: The Constant-Sign Conflict

While students may correctly substitute $y = 0.5$ to get $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$, a common error occurs at the next step: **adding vs. subtracting 3**.

1.  **The Misstep:** Many students have a "learned association" where they see a positive number on the right side of the equation ($30$) and subconsciously decide to subtract the constant ($3$) from it, rather than performing the inverse operation of the term being moved. 
2.  **The Resulting Error:** A student may mistakenly calculate $10x = 30 - 3$, leading to $10x = 27$ and an answer of **$2.7$ (Option D)**. 
3.  **Why this happens here:** In introductory algebra, many standard problems are of the form $ax + b = c$, where $b$ is positive and students get used to subtracting it. Here, the equation $10x - 3 = 30$ requires *adding* 3 ($10x = 33$). If a student is operating on "autopilot" based on the most common equation patterns they've practiced, they will reflexively choose subtraction, making Option D the most powerful "distractor" in the set.

**Summary:** The question is difficult because it tests whether a student can resist the "subtraction reflex" triggered by the presence of a positive result ($30$), ensuring they correctly apply the inverse operation to a negative intermediate term ($-3$).
