One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **visual/notational trap** regarding the vertical orientation of the table.

In standard textbook practice, a vertical table of values almost always places the **$x$-values in the left column** and the **$y$-values in the right column**. Because students are conditioned to read from left to right, they often instinctively view the first column as "inputs" and the second column as "outputs."

In this specific question, however, the unknown value ($\bigstar$) is located in the **top row** alongside the variable $x$, while the given value ($0.5$) is in the **bottom row** alongside $y$. 

A significant number of students will ignore the $x$ and $y$ labels in the left-hand header and instinctively perform the more common operation: plugging $0.5$ in for $x$ and solving for $y$. 

**The Error Path:**
1.  Student assumes $x = 0.5$.
2.  Equation becomes $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$.
3.  $5 - 6y = 30 \rightarrow -6y = 25 \rightarrow y \approx -4.16$.

Because this result isn't among the choices, the student may become confused or attempt to "force" the math to match Option B ($-4.25$), leading to a mistake driven purely by the visual habit of treating the first numerical column as the $x$-coordinate.
