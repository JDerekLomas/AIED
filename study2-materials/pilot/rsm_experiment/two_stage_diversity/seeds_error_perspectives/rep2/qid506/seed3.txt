As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify the most significant difficulty in this problem as the **misapplication of "scaling intuition" when dividing a unit fraction by a whole number.**

Specifically, students commonly fail because they incorrectly apply the **"division makes things smaller"** heuristic through the wrong operation.

### The Specific Difficulty: Inverse Operation Confusion
Students recognize that they must "move" the 3 to the other side of the equation. Because the left side is $3 \times p$, they know the inverse operation is division. However, when faced with $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$, many students revert to **whole-number multiplication logic** because it is cognitively easier than fractional division.

They perform the operation: $12 \div 3 = 4$. 

This leads them to **Option A ($p = \frac{1}{4}$)**.

### Why this happens:
1.  **The Visual Trap:** The numbers 3 and 12 have a strong "fact family" relationship (3, 4, 12). When a student sees $3p$ and $12$ in the same equation, the number **4** is cognitively "primed."
2.  **Fractional Misconception:** Students often treat the denominator as a standalone integer. Instead of treating $1/12$ as a single value to be partitioned into three smaller pieces (resulting in $1/36$), they treat the denominator $12$ as the object being operated upon. 
3.  **Linear Thinking:** They erroneously calculate $\frac{1}{(12 \div 3)}$ rather than the correct $\frac{1}{(12 \times 3)}$. They intuitively feel that since they are *dividing* the equation by 3, the number 12 should become *smaller* (3 times smaller is 4), ignoring that decreasing the denominator actually *increases* the value of the fraction.

In this specific case, **Option A** acts as a powerful "distractor" because it rewards a correct identification of the inverse operation (division) but fails on the procedural execution of fractional arithmetic.
