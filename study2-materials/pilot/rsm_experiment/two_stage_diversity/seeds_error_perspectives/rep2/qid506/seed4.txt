As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify a specific difficulty in this problem related to **procedural over-generalization of the "multiplication by the reciprocal" rule.**

**Specific Difficulty: The "Integer Division" Trap**

A significant number of students will erroneously choose **Option A ($p = \frac{1}{4}$)** because they intuitively associate the integers 3 and 12 with the division $12 \div 3 = 4$. 

Specifically, the difficulty lies in the mental management of the denominator:
1.  **The Error Pathway:** The student correctly identifies the inverse operation required is division ($p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3$). 
2.  **The Misstep:** Instead of multiplying the denominator (finding a third of a twelfth), the student isolates the integer "12" and the integer "3" and performs the more "comfortable" division $12/3$. 
3.  **The Result:** They move the 3 under the 12 rather than under the *entire* fraction, or they simply perceive the fraction line as a decorative element rather than a rigid operator.

**Why this feature makes the error more likely:**
In equations like $3p = 12$, the answer is 4. In equations like $\frac{1}{3}p = 12$, the answer is 36. This specific question combines both elements in a way that creates "interference." Students see the "3" and "12" and their brains gravitate toward the factor pair (3, 4, 12) rather than the rigorous multiplicative property $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$. 

Option A acts as a highly effective **"attractor"** because it allows the student to feel they have "solved" the relationship between the two visible integers without engaging in the cognitively heavier task of multiplying two unit-fraction denominators.
