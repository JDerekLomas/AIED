As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify the most significant difficulty in this question as the **"Division by Integers vs. Scaling the Denominator"** conceptual trap, specifically leading to the popular distractor **A (\(p = 1/4\))**.

### The Specific Difficulty: "Inverse Operation Symmetry"

Students at this level are conditioned to recognize that "to undo a multiplication by 3, you divide by 3." However, when the right side of the equation is a unit fraction ($\frac{1}{12}$), many students apply a flawed **additive/subtractive logic** to the denominator rather than multiplicative logic.

**The mental error follows this path:**
1. The student identifies they must "move" the 3.
2. They look at the 12 in the denominator and see a familiar arithmetic relationship between 3 and 12 ($12 \div 3 = 4$).
3. Instead of multiplying the denominator ($12 \times 3$), they **perform the division on the denominator itself.**

**Why this happens:**
Students often possess a fragile understanding of fraction division. They perceive the operation $p = \frac{1/12}{3}$ as an instruction to "simplify" the 12 using the 3. Because $12/3 = 4$, they instinctively produce $1/4$. This is reinforced by a common visual trap: the number 3 "looks" like it belongs with the 12, and since 12 is "at the bottom," they assume the resulting 4 should also stay "at the bottom."

In this instance, the **numbers 3 and 12 are "divisible-friendly,"** which paradoxically makes the question harder than if the numbers were, for example, 3 and 11. If the equation were $3p = 1/11$, the student would be forced to think about the algorithm, but $3p = 1/12$ invites an intuitive but incorrect simplification.
