One specific reason why students frequently find this question difficult is the **misapplication of "inverse operations" due to the proximity of the integers 3 and 12.**

Specifically, students often succumb to **mental number fact retrieval** instead of algebraic manipulation. When a student sees the numbers "3" and "12" in a division-adjacent context, their brain reflexively retrieves the fact $3 \times 4 = 12$ or $12 \div 3 = 4$. This leads to two common "pathway" errors:

1.  **The "Visual Multiplication" Error (Leading to Distractor A):** The student sees the 3 on the left and the 12 on the right and performs $12 \div 3$ as if the equation were $3p = 12$. They correctly identify the result as 4, but because the original problem involved a fraction, they maintain the fractional structure, resulting in $p = \frac{1}{4}$.
2.  **The "Inverse Swap" Error (Leading to Distractor C):** The student recognizes they need to divide by 3, but in their mind, they divide the denominator of $\frac{1}{12}$ by 3 (essentially treating it as $12 \div 3$) rather than multiplying it, mistakenly arriving at a whole number $p = 4$.

This difficulty is rooted in **integer-fraction interference**, where the intuitive "friendliness" of the numbers 3 and 12 overrides the formal rule of multiplying the denominator by the coefficient (or multiplying both sides by $\frac{1}{3}$). Students who rely on "shortcutting" to a simplified number fact will pick $A$ or $C$ before they ever consider the correct multiplicative increase of the denominator to $36$.
