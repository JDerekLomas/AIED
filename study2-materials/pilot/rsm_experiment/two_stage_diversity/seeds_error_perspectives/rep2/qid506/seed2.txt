As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify the most significant difficulty in this question as the **misapplication of "multiplication by a constant" when dealing with a unit fraction result.**

Specifically, students are likely to succumb to a **perceptual association error** where they prioritize the relationship between the integers 3 and 12 over the actual algebraic operation.

### The Specific Difficulty: The "Integer Factor" Trap
When students see $3$ on one side and $12$ on the other, many engage in "number sense shortcutting" rather than formal manipulation. Because $12 \div 3 = 4$, the number **4** becomes mentally salient. 

This leads to two common incorrect cognitive pathways:

1.  **Inverse Misplacement (Option A):** The student recognizes they need to divide by 3, but their brain shortcuts to the simple division of $12 \div 3 = 4$. They then place this 4 back into a fractional form ($1/4$) because the original constant was a fraction ($1/12$), neglecting that dividing a fraction by a whole number makes the denominator *larger*, not smaller.
2.  **Arithmetic Reflex (Option C):** The student ignores the fractional structure entirely and simply treats the equation as $12 \div 3$, leading them to $p = 4$.

### Why this happens here
The numbers 3 and 12 are "compatible numbers." If the equation had been $3p = \frac{1}{13}$, students would be forced to engage in the formal algorithm (multiplying 13 by 3) because 13 and 3 have no common factors. However, because $12$ is a multiple of $3$, the visual "attraction" of the number 4 creates a cognitive obstacle that prevents the student from performing the correct multiplication ($12 \times 3 = 36$) required to isolate $p$.

In summary, the difficulty lies in the **interference of basic division facts ($12/3$)** with the required **fractional division algorithm.**
