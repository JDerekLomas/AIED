As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **mnemonic-driven "Addition over Subtraction" trap in Problem P** as the specific reason many students find this question difficult, specifically leading them to choose **Option D**.

### The Specific Difficulty: "The Letter-Order Trap"
In Problem P (\(4 - 5 + 6\)), students often over-rely on the literal string of letters in mnemonics like **PEMDAS** or **BODMAS**. Because "A" (Addition) comes before "S" (Subtraction) in these acronyms, students frequently develop a rigid hierarchical misconception that all addition must be completed before any subtraction.

*   **The Error:** A student will isolate the term \(5 + 6\) first, thinking they are following the order of operations. This leads them to perform \(4 - (5 + 6) = 4 - 11 = -7\), rather than processing the expression from left to right: \((4 - 5) + 6 = -1 + 6 = 5\).
*   **The Notational Trap:** The visual layout of the plus sign (\(+\)) acts as a "stronger" operator than the minus sign (\(-\)) in many students' minds. This is compounded by the fact that they are taught that \(4 + 5 + 6\) can be done in any order (Commutative Property); they incorrectly generalize this flexibility to expressions involving subtraction, failing to recognize the minus sign as a property of the \(5\) (i.e., \(-5\)).

In this multiple-choice setup, **Option D** is a highly "attractive" distractor because it validates this specific hierarchical misconception for both problems simultaneously. While students may correctly identify the multiplication priority in Problem Q, the incorrect prioritization of addition in Problem P acts as a cognitive hurdle that rewards a misunderstanding of operational parity.
