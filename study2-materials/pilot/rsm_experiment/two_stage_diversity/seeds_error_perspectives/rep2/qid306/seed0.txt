As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **acronym-based literalism of "PEMDAS" or "BODMAS"** as a specific feature that makes Problem P significantly more difficult (and likely to lead to error) than Problem Q.

### The Specific Difficulty: The "Addition before Subtraction" Trap
In Problem P ($4 - 5 + 6$), many students will incorrectly select **Option D** because they have been taught the mnemonic PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction) or BODMAS as a rigid, linear hierarchy.

**The Notational Trap:**
Because the letter **'A' (Addition)** precedes the letter **'S' (Subtraction)** in the acronym, students frequently develop a "canonical" misunderstanding that all addition must be completed globally before any subtraction is attempted. This leads them to look at $4 - 5 + 6$ and conclude they must first calculate $5 + 6$.

**Why this is a concrete hurdle in this problem:**
*   **The visual grouping:** In the expression $4 - 5 + 6$, the $5$ and $6$ are separated by a plus sign. A student following the mnemonic literally will "eye" the $5+6$ as a priority unit.
*   **The cognitive conflict:** If the student performs $5 + 6$ first (getting $11$) and then tries to subtract that from $4$, they encounter a negative result ($-7$). If they correctly follow left-to-right order ($4 - 5 = -1$, then $-1 + 6 = 5$), the math is actually simpler, but the rigid mnemonic overrides their operational intuition.

In contrast, Problem Q is "easier" because the mnemonic actually works in its linear form (Multiplication before Addition). Therefore, the primary difficulty lies in **Problem P**, where the mnemonic serves as a "false friend," leading students to ignore the left-to-right convention for operators of equal precedence.
