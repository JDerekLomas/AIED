As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle in this problem as the **misinterpretation of the "Addition before Subtraction" rule within the PEMDAS/BODMAS mnemonic.**

### Specific Reason for Difficulty: The "A before S" Literalism

Many students believe that mathematical operations must follow the strict letter-by-order of the mnemonic (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, **Addition, Subtraction**). This leads to a specific error in **Problem P**:

*   **The Error:** Students see the addition sign ($+$) between the $5$ and $6$ and conclude that they must perform $5 + 6$ first, regardless of its position in the string.
*   **The Trap:** This leads them to select **Option C or D**. 
*   **The Mathematical Reality:** Addition and Subtraction hold equal priority and must be performed from left to right. In Problem P, the correct first step is $4 - 5$. 

### Why this is a "Visual Trap"
The difficulty is exacerbated by the visual structure of Problem P. When a student looks at $4 - 5 + 6$, the $5 + 6$ is a "clean" addition problem that sits on the right. Students who struggle with directed numbers (integers) instinctively shy away from $4 - 5$ because it results in a negative number ($-1$). Consequently, they subconsciously gravitate toward $5 + 6$ not only because of the mnemonic's alphabetical order but because it allows them to stay within the comfort zone of positive natural numbers.

In contrast, students often find **Problem Q** easier to navigate because the mnemonic's rule ("Multiplication before Addition") happens to align with the correct order of operations, creating a false sense of security that fails them when they encounter Problem P.
