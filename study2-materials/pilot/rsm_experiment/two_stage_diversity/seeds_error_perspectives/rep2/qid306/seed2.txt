As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify a specific difficulty in this problem related to **a visual and linguistic trap created by the "Order of Operations" mnemonics (like PEMDAS, BODMAS, or BIDMAS).**

### The "A comes before S" Trap in Problem P

Students often find **Problem P** difficult because the addition sign occurs between the digits 5 and 6, triggering a rigid interpretation of mnemonics where **Addition (A)** must always precede **Subtraction (S)**.

**Specifically:**
Many students will select **Option D** (identifying $5+6$ as the first step in Problem P) because they believe "Addition comes before Subtraction" is a universal rule of hierarchy rather than a convention of left-to-right priority.

**Why this is a specific cognitive trap:**
1.  **Visual Grouping:** In the expression $4 - 5 + 6$, the addition operator $(+)$ sits physically between the $5$ and the $6$. To a student prone to "scanning" for the "A" in PEMDAS, this creates a powerful visual cue to group $(5+6)$ first.
2.  **The "Plus Sign" Attraction:** Educational research shows students are often "attracted" to addition as a "stronger" or more familiar operation than subtraction.
3.  **Semantic Interference:** Because the mnemonic is taught as a string of letters, students process the sequence *Addition $\rightarrow$ Subtraction* as a fixed vertical hierarchy rather than a horizontal "tie-break" (left-to-right). 

Consequently, students will mistakenly calculate $5+6=11$, then $4-11=-7$, whereas the correct left-to-right procedure ($4-5=-1$, then $-1+6=5$) requires doing the subtraction ($4-5$) first. This specific misconception makes Option B the correct mathematical choice but Option D the most "attractive" distractor.
