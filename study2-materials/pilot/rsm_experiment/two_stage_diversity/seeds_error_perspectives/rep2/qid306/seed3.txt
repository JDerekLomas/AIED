As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **"Addition-before-Subtraction" (AS) literalism** within the PEMDAS/BODMAS mnemonic as the specific reason why students find **Problem P** difficult, leading them to choose **Option D**.

### The Specific Difficulty: The Left-to-Right Convention vs. Literal Mnemonic Decoding

In Problem P ($4 - 5 + 6$), many students incorrectly believe they must perform the addition first ($5 + 6$) simply because the letter **A** (Addition) precedes **S** (Subtraction) in the acronym PEMDAS/BODMAS.

#### Why this is a "Visual and Notational Trap":
1.  **The Over-reliance on the String:** Students often treat the mnemonic as a rigid, serial hierarchy rather than recognizing that addition and subtraction exist on the same tier of precedence. To a student following the mnemonic literally, "doing the 'A' first" is a logical rule application.
2.  **The Subtraction Sign Attachment:** Visually, many students see the expression as $4 - (5 + 6)$. They perceive the addition symbol between the $5$ and $6$ as a signal to group those two numbers together first. 
3.  **The Resulting Error:** By performing $5 + 6$ first, the student arrives at $11$, then tries to calculate $4 - 11$, resulting in $-7$. If they follow the correct left-to-right convention (Problem P: $4 - 5 = -1$; then $-1 + 6 = 5$), they realize the subtraction must come first.

### Why this leads to choosing Option D:
While students usually handle **Problem Q** correctly (recognizing that multiplication precedes addition), their commitment to the "Addition first" rule in Problem P lures them into Option D. This choice acts as a "strong distractor" because it rewards their correct knowledge of multiplication rules while simultaneously validating their common misconception about the linear order of addition and subtraction.
