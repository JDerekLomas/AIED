One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **notation of the negative base when squaring or exponentiating**, specifically the conceptual confusion between $(-3)^4$ and $-3^4$.

In mathematics, the question asks for the value of $k^4$ where $k = -3$, which necessitates the substitution $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$. However, many students are habituated to typing expressions into scientific calculators or writing them without parentheses. On most calculators, entering $-3^4$ yields **-81** because the order of operations treats the exponent as having priority over the negative sign (negation).

**The Trap:**
Students who correctly recognize that $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$ may still select **Option C (-81)** because they interpret the "negative" as a final step to be applied *after* the exponentiation, rather than realizing that the negative sign is an intrinsic part of the base $k$ that must be multiplied an even number of times. This is a common notational trap where the formal definition of substitution $(k)^4$ conflicts with a student's visual "left-to-right" reading of the negative symbol.
