One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **notation-dependency of the negative sign when applying an even exponent**, leading them to choose **C) -81**.

When a student replaces $k$ with $-3$, they often perform the calculation as if it were written $-3^4$ rather than $(-3)^4$. In standard mathematical notation (and on most scientific calculators), the exponent takes precedence over the negation ($ -3^4 = -(3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3) = -81 $). 

Because the variable $k$ represents the *entire* base $-3$, the negative sign must be included in the fourfold multiplication ($(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$). However, students who conceptually understand that $3^4 = 81$ may instinctively attach the negative sign from the $k$-value to the final result, failing to realize that an even number of negative factors cancels out to a positive product. Choice C acts as a "signature-preserving" trap for those who do not correctly internalize that the negative sign is part of the base being raised to the power.
