One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **notation-dependency of the negative sign when raising a base to an even power**, leading many to choose **C) -81**.

When students perform this calculation, they often process the negative sign separately from the numerical exponentiation. Many learners rely on the mental heuristic that "if there is a minus sign in the input, there should be one in the output," or they rely on calculator syntax where inputting $-3^4$ yields $-81$ (interpreting it as $-(3^4)$) while $(-3)^4$ yields $81$. 

In this specific question, because $k$ is substituted as a single entity, the exponent applies to the entire value of $-3$. However, students who lack a structural understanding of substitution often fail to "auto-bracket" the negative number. They perform the calculation as $-(3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3)$ rather than $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$, failing to recognize that the four negative signs pair up to create a positive product.
