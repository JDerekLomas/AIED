One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **notation-dependent handling of the negative sign during substitution**, specifically when a student interprets \( -3^4 \) differently than \( (-3)^4 \).

When a student replaces the variable \( k \) with \(-3\), the mathematical requirement is to raise the entire value (\(-3\)) to the power of 4. However, many students do not mentally or physically use parentheses during the substitution step. If they write or visualize the calculation as \(-3^4\), standard order of operations (BIDMAS/PEMDAS) dictates that the exponent be applied to the 3 first ($3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$), and then the negative sign is applied last, resulting in **-81 (Option C)**.

This is a specific "notational trap" where the student understands that $3^4 = 81$ and understands that $k$ is negative, but they fail to apply the rule that **an even power of any real negative number is positive**. They view the negative sign as a prefix to the term rather than an integral part of the base being multiplied.
