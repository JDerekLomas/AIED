One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **atypical arrangement of the linear equation (standard form vs. slope-intercept form)**, which leads to a common algebraic "reversal" error.

In many introductory algebra curricula, students are conditioned to treat $x$ as the input and $y$ as the isolated output ($y = mx + b$). When presented with the equation $4x + 2y = 10$, a common error is for students to substitute $x = 0$ correctly but then mentally skip the step of isolation, essentially treating the equation as if it were $y = 4x + 10$ or $y = \frac{10}{4}$.

Specifically, a student may correctly identify that when $x=0$, the term $4x$ "disappears," leaving $2y = 10$. However, a high-frequency error at this stage is to **multiply instead of divide** due to the proximity of the coefficient $2$ to the $y$, or to confuse the operation required to move the $2$ across the equals sign. A student making this error would select **A) 20** (calculating $10 \times 2$) or mistakenly attempt to solve for $x$ again, whereas the structure of $y = 5$ requires a division step ($10 \div 2$) that is frequently missed when students are used to $y$ already being isolated in the prompt.
