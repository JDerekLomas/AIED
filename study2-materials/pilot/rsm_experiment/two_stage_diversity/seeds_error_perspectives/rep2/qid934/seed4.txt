As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle in this problem as the **implicit multi-step manipulation required by the equation’s format ($Ax + By = C$).**

Specifically, students often struggle with the **transition from substitution to isolation** when the equation is not written in "y=" (explicit) form.

### The Specific Difficulty: The "Add vs. Divide" Procedural Error
While students can easily substitute $x = 0$ into the term $4x$ (resulting in $0$), they are left with the sub-equation: 
$$2y = 10$$

In this specific configuration, a common cognitive trap occurs:
*   **The Error:** Many students perform the operation **$10 - 2$** instead of **$10 \div 2$**. 
*   **Why this happens here:** Because the problem began with a "4 plus..." context ($4x + 2y$), the brain is primed for additive relationships. Students frequently "move" the coefficient $2$ to the other side of the equation using the incorrect inverse operation. This would lead them to an answer of **8** (though not provided as an option, it is a common distractor in open-ended versions of this task).

### The Distractor Effect (Option C)
Furthermore, there is a specific visual trap involving **Option C (5)**. A student might correctly calculate $10 \div 2 = 5$, but if they suffer from **"Premature Closure,"** they may see the $0$ in the table and the $10$ in the equation and simply divide $10/2$ without truly processing the substitution. Because the $x$ value is $0$, the coefficient of $x$ (the $4$) becomes irrelevant, which can actually make the problem "easy" for the wrong reasons—it allows a student with an incomplete understanding of linear equations to arrive at the correct answer by simply ignored the $4x$ term entirely.
