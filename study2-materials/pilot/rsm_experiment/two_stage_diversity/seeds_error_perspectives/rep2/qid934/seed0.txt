One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **visual/notational trap** involving the confusion between **substitution** and **coefficient multiplication**.

Specifically, many students struggle when a variable has a coefficient greater than 1 ($2y$) and they are solving for that variable at the point $x=0$. When students substitute $x=0$, the equation simplifies to $2y=10$. A common "compulsive" error at this stage is to mistakenly **add or subtract** the coefficient instead of dividing, or more commonly, to treat the expression $2y$ as "2 plus $y$."

**The Trap:**
Because the $x$ term effectively "disappears" ($4 \times 0 = 0$), the student is left looking at $2y=10$. If the student has a weak grasp of algebraic notation, they may bypass the division step and perform an intuitive operation:
*   They see "2" and "10" and think $10 - 2 = 8$.
*   Or, they treat the relationship as additive ($2 + ? = 10$), leading them to look for **8**.

While 8 is not provided as an option, the presence of **Option C (5)** provides a "cognitive closure" for those who do divide correctly ($10/2 = 5$), but the presence of **Option A (20)** targets those who perform the inverse operation incorrectly ($10 \times 2 = 20$). 

Furthermore, some students may ignore the equation entirely and look only at the table's header ($4x$). If they assume the "4" in $4x$ is the constant difference for the $y$ values, they may work backward from an imaginary pattern, ignoring the structural requirements of the two-variable linear equation.
