One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **atypical arrangement of the linear equation (standard form vs. slope-intercept form)**, leading to a "substitution-manipulation trap."

In most introductory algebra curricula, students are predominantly trained to evaluate functions in the form $y = mx + b$. When they see a table of values, their "auto-pilot" response is to multiply the $x$-value by a coefficient and add a constant to find $y$.

**The Specific Difficulty:**
When substituting $x=0$ into $4x + 2y = 10$, a student arrives at the sub-equation $2y = 10$. A common cognitive error here is **Coefficient Neglect** or **Premature Identification**. Because the $4x$ term vanishes ($4 \times 0 = 0$), the student’s eye is drawn immediately to the remaining numbers: **2, $y$, and 10.** 

Instead of performing the division step ($\frac{10}{2} = 5$), students often experience a "visual interference" where they:
1.  **Select C (5)** correctly if they remember to divide.
2.  **Mistakenly select B (3)** because they mentally "subtract" the coefficient ($10 - 2$) or conflate the process with solving for an intercept where they simply want to "get rid" of the 2.
3.  **Fail to notice the coefficient entirely**, assuming that once $x$ is gone, $y$ must simply equal the constant on the right ($y = 10$), which isn't an option here but often leads to "answer-guessing" from the choices provided.

Because the equation is not "solved for $y$" at the start, the student must perform an extra algebraic step *after* the substitution, which is where the majority of procedural breakdowns occur.
