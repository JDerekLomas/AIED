One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **visual/positional trap** involving the misinterpretation of the standard "Table of Values" layout.

**The Error: Substitution of $y$ for $x$.**

In a vertical table, students are trained that the left column is input ($x$) and the right is output ($y$). In this horizontal table, the star is physically located in the row labeled "$y$," but it sits directly beneath the value $x=0$. 

Because students often associate the first numerical value they see in a row or table as the "starting" variable, many will inadvertently plug the value $0$ into $y$ instead of $x$. 

*   **The specific trap:** If a student misreads the table and substitutes $y = 0$ into the equation $4x + 2y = 10$, they solve $4x = 10$, which results in $x = 2.5$. 
*   **The "Attractor":** Notice that **Option D (2.5)** is explicitly listed. This provides a "false confirmation" for the student. Seeing their result among the multiple-choice options validates their procedural error, preventing them from double-checking whether they swapped the $x$ and $y$ coordinates.
