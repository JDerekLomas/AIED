A primary reason students find this question difficult is a specific **visual trap involving the denominators**, which often leads them to apply the common "shortcut" of adding across.

### The Specific Difficulty: The "Add Everything" Heuristic
Students who struggle with rational expressions often default to the incorrect rule: **"Add the numerators, add the denominators."** 

In this specific problem, a student is likely to calculate $3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$, leading them directly to **Option B $(\frac{7}{3x})$**. 

**Why this specific question triggers that error:**
*   **Variable Consistency:** Because both denominators contain the same variable ($x$), the denominators look "similar enough" to tempt a student into treating them like integers. Unlike a problem where one denominator is $2x$ and the other is $y$, the visual consistency of $x$ encourages the student to simply perform $2+1$ on the coefficients.
*   **Distractor Plausibility:** Option B acts as a powerful "siren" because the arithmetic $(3+4=7, 2+1=3)$ is easy and yields a clean-looking result. 

### Contrast with why some find it easy:
Conversely, students who find this easy recognize a **procedural shortcut** specific to these numbers: they see that the second fraction $\frac{4}{x}$ can be "doubled" to $\frac{8}{2x}$ through a simple mental multiplication. Because the common denominator ($2x$) is a direct multiple of the other ($x$), it eliminates the need for the more complex "cross-multiplication" method, making the path to the correct answer, **Option A**, mathematically light.
