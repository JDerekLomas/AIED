One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a common **visual/notational trap involving the coefficient 2** in the first denominator, which frequently leads to the incorrect application of the "cross-multiplication" (or "butterfly") method.

When students see denominators of $2x$ and $x$, many fail to recognize that $2x$ is a common multiple. Instead, they apply a rote procedure of multiplying the two denominators together to find a common denominator of $2x^2$. 

The trap occurs in the subsequent "simplification" phase:
1. They calculate the numerator as $(3 \cdot x) + (4 \cdot 2x) = 11x$.
2. They arrive at the unsimplified fraction $\frac{11x}{2x^2}$.
3. **The difficulty:** Many students at this level struggle to "see" that $x$ can be cancelled from the numerator and the squared term in the denominator. If they fail to simplify the powers of $x$, they may believe none of the provided options (A-D) are correct, or they may perform an illegal cancellation (e.g., subtracting $x$ from the top and bottom) and end up choosing an incorrect option like **C**. 

This problem is "easier" only for students who recognize the **relative relationship** between the denominators ($2x$ and $x$), allowing them to simply double the second fraction to $\frac{8}{2x}$. Students who rely on the mechanical shortcut of multiplying denominators create a much more complex algebraic simplification task for themselves than the question intended.
