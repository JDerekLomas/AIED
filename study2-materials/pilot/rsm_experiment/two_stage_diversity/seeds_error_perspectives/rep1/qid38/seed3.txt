As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **common visual trap of "Add Everything" (The Linearity Error)** as a specific reason students find this question difficult, leading them to choose **Option B**.

### The Specific Difficulty: "Denominator Summation"
A significant portion of students will apply a naive "add across" strategy, where they treat the numerators and denominators as independent integers. Because the denominators look like separate entities ($2x$ and $x$), a student may instinctively calculate:
*   Numerator: $3 + 4 = 7$
*   Denominator: $2x + x = 3x$
*   Result: $\frac{7}{3x}$

### Why this happens in this specific context:
1.  **Over-generalization of Multiplication rules:** In fraction multiplication, you *do* multiply the denominators together. Students often conflate these rules, especially when algebraic terms (variables) are involved, as the presence of $x$ increases cognitive load and makes them more likely to revert to "primitive" arithmetic rules.
2.  **Notational Interpretation:** The $x$ acts as a distractor. To a struggling student, "adding the $x$s" feels like a logical step in simplifying the expression, much like combining like terms in a linear equation (e.g., $2x + x = 3x$). This makes Option B a highly "attractive" distractor because it satisfies the urge to "combine" all components of the problem.

By contrast, students who find this **easy** are those who recognize the **multiplicative relationship** between the denominators ($2x$ is exactly $2 \times x$). If the denominators were unrelated (e.g., $2x$ and $3y$), the difficulty would spike, but the "2" in $2x$ provides a clear scaffold for those who understand the concept of the Lowest Common Multiple.
