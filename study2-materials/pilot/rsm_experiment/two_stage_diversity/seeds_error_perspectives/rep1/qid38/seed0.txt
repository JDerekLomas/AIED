As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **common error of "adding across" (Option B)** as a specific reason students find this question difficult, particularly due to the notation used in the second fraction.

**The Specific Obstacle: Visual Misalignment of the Common Denominator**
A common misconception in fractional addition is that one must always multiply both denominators to find a common ground, or worse, simply add the numerators and denominators together. Students who apply the "add across" rule will perform $(3+4) / (2x + x) = 7/3x$, leading them directly to the distractor **Option B**.

However, the specific feature of this question that increases difficulty is the **lack of a visible coefficient of 1 in the second term**. In $\frac{4}{x}$, the "1" in front of the $x$ is implicit. Many students struggle to recognize that the common denominator is simply $2x$ because they do not intuitively see $x$ as "half" of $2x$. 

**The Step Where They Fail:**
Instead of performing the simple scaling step (multiplying $\frac{4}{x}$ by $\frac{2}{2}$ to get $\frac{8}{2x}$), many students resort to a "Cross-Multiply and Smile" (butterfly) method because they see two different-looking algebraic terms ($2x$ and $x$). This unnecessarily complicates the arithmetic:
1. They calculate $3(x) + 4(2x) = 3x + 8x = 11x$ for the numerator.
2. They calculate $(2x)(x) = 2x^2$ for the denominator.
3. This leaves them with $\frac{11x}{2x^2}$.

The difficulty here is the **algebraic simplification step**. A student who reaches $11x/2x^2$ must possess the secondary skill of canceling the $x$ to reach the correct answer (**Option A**). If they lack the confidence to simplify $x/x^2$, they are likely to abandon their work and guess a visually simpler option like B or D.
