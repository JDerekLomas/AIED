One specific reason why students frequently find this question difficult is a **visual/notational trap** related to the concept of **reciprocal miscue**.

When students see the coefficient $3$ on the left and the fraction $1/12$ on the right, many intuit that the relationship between $3$ and $12$ must result in a $4$, as they are used to the basic fact $3 \times 4 = 12$ or $12 \div 3 = 4$. This leads to a common cognitive "short-circuit":

Because the $12$ is in the denominator, the student incorrectly assumes that to "move" the $3$, they should perform the division $12 \div 3$ within that denominator, leading them to select **Option A ($p=1/4$)**.

This error occurs because the student applies the division operation locally to the number they see ($12$) rather than to the entire quantity ($1/12$). Instead of multiplying by the reciprocal ($1/3$) or dividing the whole fraction by $3$ (which would yield $1/36$), they "reduce" the fraction's denominator by the coefficient, essentially treating $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$ as if it were $\frac{1}{12 \div 3}$.
