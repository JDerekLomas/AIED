As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **"intuitive scaling error"**—specifically, the tendency for students to apply the operation to the whole number denominator rather than the entire fractional value—as the primary reason for difficulty.

### The Specific Difficulty: Inverse Operation Confusion with Unit Fractions

The most common point of failure is the execution of the division step: $p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3$. 

Many students at this level rely on a "number-bond" intuition rather than a rigorous multiplicative process. When they see the $3$ on the left and the $12$ on the right, their brains instinctively look for a relationship between those two integers. Because $12 \div 3 = 4$, students frequently perform the inverse operation on the **denominator only**, leading them to **Option A ($p = 1/4$)**.

**Why this happens:**
1.  **Visual Over-reliance:** Students perceive the "12" as the primary object to be operated upon. Instead of multiplying the entire quantity $(\frac{1}{12})$ by $\frac{1}{3}$, they treat the equation as $3p = (\text{something involving } 12)$, leading to the mental shortcut: *"What is 12 divided by 3? 4. So the answer must be 1/4."*
2.  **Misapplication of Inverse Logic:** Students often internalize that "division makes things smaller." However, because they are dealing with a fraction, they erroneously apply that "shrinking" logic to the denominator. Since 4 is smaller than 12, they believe $1/4$ is the "divided" version of $1/12$, forgetting that a smaller denominator actually signifies a larger total value.

This specific notational trap—where the dividend is a unit fraction—turns the correct answer (**B, $1/36$**) into a counter-intuitive result for students who equate "dividing by 3" with "finding a 3-related integer" within the fraction.
