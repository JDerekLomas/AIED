As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle in this question as the **"Operation Inverse Bias" leading to Distractor A**.

Specifically, many students struggle with the visual and conceptual conflict between the **multiplicative relationship** of the coefficient ($3p$) and the **unit fraction** on the right side ($1/12$).

### The Specific Difficulty: "Multiplicative Matching"
A common error occurs during the step where students attempt to isolate $p$. Students often focus on the numerical relationship between the integers $3$ and $12$. Because they recognize $12$ as a multiple of $3$, they perform a "pseudo-calculation" where they mentally simplify $12 \div 3 = 4$.

**The Visual Trap:**
Students see $3$ and $12$ and instinctively look for a solution involving $4$. Instead of correctly applying the multiplicative inverse (multiplying both sides by $1/3$), they intuitively "move" the $3$ over and divide the denominator ($12$) by it. This results in:
$$p = \frac{1}{12 \div 3} = \frac{1}{4}$$

### Why this is a "Notational Trap":
In equations where the right side is a whole number (e.g., $3p = 12$), the division $12/3$ is straightforward. However, when the right side is a fraction, students often fail to apply the operation to the **entire value**. They treat the denominator as a standalone integer rather than part of a reciprocal relationship.

Distractor A acts as a "magnetic" choice because it feels like a successful simplification. Distractor B ($1/36$), which is the correct answer, is often bypassed by struggling students because the number $36$ "feels" too large compared to the input numbers $3$ and $12$, leading to an erroneous rejection of the correct procedure ($1/12 \times 1/3$).
