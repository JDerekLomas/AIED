One specific reason students find this question difficult is the **“inverse operation miscue” regarding the integer 3**, leading to the selection of Distractor A ($1/4$).

Specifically, when students see a coefficient of $3$ on one side and a $12$ in the denominator on the other, they often intuitively perceive the relationship as $12 \div 3$. Instead of performing the correct algebraic step—dividing both sides by $3$ (which is equivalent to multiplying the denominator by $3$)—the student performs a "partial" inverse operation. They recognize they must move the $3$ to the other side, but they mentally "attach" it to the $12$ using division ($12/3$) because $12$ is a multiple of $3$, rather than multiplication ($12 \times 3$).

This error is exacerbated by the **notational trap** of the fraction bar: the $12$ is already in a "division" position, and the brain's desire for a "clean" integer result ($4$) often overrides the formal rules of reciprocal multiplication. Consequently, the student produces $1/4$ rather than the correct $1/36$.
