As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle in this question as the **misapplication of the "multiplication by the reciprocal" shortcut**—specifically, the cognitive lure of the number 4.

**The Specific Trap:**
Many students at the pre-algebra and early algebra levels develop a "reflexive" association between the numbers 3 and 12, as they are a basic multiplication fact $(3 \times 4 = 12)$. When students see the structure $3p = \frac{1}{12}$, they often incorrectly process the division step by mentally "moving" the 3 to the denominator of the right-hand side, but then intuitively simplifying the resulting fraction part $(\frac{12}{3})$ instead of performing the actual multiplication $(12 \times 3)$.

**Why students go wrong at this step:**
Students often attempt to "isolate $p$" by dividing both sides by 3. However, instead of writing out the complex fraction $\frac{1/12}{3}$ or the operation $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$, they perform a mental shortcut: 
*   "I need to divide 12 by 3." 
*   This leads them to Distractor **A ($1/4$)**.

This error is driven by a "Number Sense Interference." The student’s brain prioritizes the clean, familiar division $(12 \div 3 = 4)$ over the procedurally correct but more "messy" multiplication of denominators $(12 \times 3 = 36)$. Because $1/4$ looks like a "neater" result than $1/36$, students are psychologically nudged toward the incorrect option, feeling that they have "solved" the relationship between 3 and 12.
