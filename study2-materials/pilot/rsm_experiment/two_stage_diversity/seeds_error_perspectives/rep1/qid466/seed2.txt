A primary reason students find this question difficult is a **misapplication of the "opposite" vs. "reciprocal" rules** specifically concerning the negative sign.

When students learn about operations that result in 1 or 0, they often conflate two distinct concepts:
1.  **Additive Inverses:** To get zero, you change the sign ($x + (-x) = 0$).
2.  **Multiplicative Inverses:** To get one, you flip the fraction ($x \cdot \frac{1}{x} = 1$).

The specific "trap" in this question lies in the interaction between the negative sign in the expression and the negative sign in the product ($-1$).

**The Specific Error:**
Many students correctly identify that they need the reciprocal ($\frac{4}{3}$) to deal with the magnitude of the numbers. However, because the target product is **negative** ($-1$), they apply a "keep the sign" shortcut. They see a negative sign in the problem and a negative sign in the answer and conclude that the star must be a positive number to "keep things the same." They select **Option A ($4/3$)** because they fail to realize that a negative multiplied by a positive maintains the negative, whereas a negative multiplied by a negative (Option B) would result in a positive 1.

The difficulty is not just in the arithmetic, but in the **notational interference** of having three different negative signs to track: one in the coefficient, one in the target product, and the potential one in the answer.
