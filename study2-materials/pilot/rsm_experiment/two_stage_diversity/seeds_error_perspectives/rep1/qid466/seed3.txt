As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **management of the product's sign in relation to the multiplicative inverse** as the primary point of difficulty.

Specifically, students frequently suffer from **"Over-generalization of the Negative"** when working with reciprocals. 

### The Specific Difficulty:
Students who understand that the target is "1" know they need the reciprocal ($4/3$). However, a common misconception arises where students associate the process of "undoing" or "balancing" an equation with the rule for **additive inverses** (where $-3/4$ becomes $+3/4$) rather than **multiplicative inverses**.

**How this manifests in the options:**
*   **The Error:** A student identifies that they need the reciprocal ($4/3$). They then see the negative sign in the original fraction ($-\frac{3}{4}$) and instinctively feel that to "cancel it out" or "move it across the equals sign," the sign must **change** to positive. 
*   **The Trap:** This leads them to select **Option A ($4/3$)** instead of the correct Option B. They correctly perform the fractional inversion but incorrectly apply a "sign-flip" logic borrowed from addition/subtraction context.

**Why this is a "notational trap":**
The result of the equation is $-1$. If the result had been $+1$, the signs would have to match (negative $\times$ negative). Because the result remains negative, one factor must be positive and one must be negative. The presence of three negative signs across the whole problem (the factor, the star, and the product) creates a cognitive load where students lose track of the "Sign Rule" ( $(-)(+) = (-)$ ) and instead revert to the more basic, but here incorrect, algebraic intuition that "to solve for a variable, you change the sign."
