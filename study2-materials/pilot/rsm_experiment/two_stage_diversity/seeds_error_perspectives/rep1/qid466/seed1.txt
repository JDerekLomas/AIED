One specific reason students often find this question difficult is **sign interference between the product and the multiplicand**, leading to a "sign matching" error.

In this specific problem, students often observe that the equation equals a negative number ($-1$) and that the first term is already negative ($-\frac{3}{4}$). Because the final answer is negative, many students intuitively feel the star must also be negative to "maintain the sign" of the equation. This leads them to incorrectly select **Option B ($-\frac{4}{3}$)**.

The difficulty lies in the conceptual hurdle of "Negative $\times$ Positive = Negative." Students frequently overgeneralize the rule "Negative $\times$ Negative = Positive" or rely on a visual symmetry where they want all terms in the equation to look the same (negative). To get this right, a student must override the visual cue of the negative signs they see in the prompt and correctly identify that a positive value is required to keep the product negative.
