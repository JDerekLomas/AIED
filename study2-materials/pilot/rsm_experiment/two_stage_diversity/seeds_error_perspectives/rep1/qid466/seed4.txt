As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the **"Multiplicative Inverse Sign Confusion"** as a specific reason why students find this question difficult, specifically leading them to choose **B** instead of the correct answer **A**.

### The Specific Difficulty: Sign Preservation in Inverses
Students often learn the rules for **additive inverses** and **multiplicative inverses (reciprocals)** around the same time, leading to a "cognitive interference" where they conflate the two sets of rules.

**The Error Pattern:**
Many students over-generalize the rule for addition—where "finding the inverse" requires changing the sign (e.g., the inverse of $5$ is $-5$). When asked to find a multiplicative inverse to reach a product of $1$, they feel that an "inverse" operation *must* involve a change in sign to "cancel out" the original value. 

**How it manifests in this question:**
1.  The student recognizes that the magnitude must be $\frac{4}{3}$ to turn $\frac{3}{4}$ into $1$.
2.  They see the negative sign in front of $-\frac{3}{4}$.
3.  Because they are conditioned to think of "inverting" as "changing to the opposite," they reflexively choose $-\frac{4}{3}$, thinking they must preserve the sign of the original term.
4.  **The Resulting Error:** They fail to realize that to reach a **positive** product of $1$ (hidden within the $-1$ context), they must multiply two negatives. If the question were $-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = 1$, the error rate would be even higher; in this specific problem ($= -1$), the student must realize that the $\star$ must be positive to keep the entire left side negative. 

**Summary of the trap:** 
Students often fail to distinguish between **taking the reciprocal** (flipping the fraction) and **negating** (changing the sign). Because the question involves a negative fraction, students are highly likely to include a negative sign in their answer simply because the "problem looks negative," missing the structural requirement that a negative times a positive equals a negative.
