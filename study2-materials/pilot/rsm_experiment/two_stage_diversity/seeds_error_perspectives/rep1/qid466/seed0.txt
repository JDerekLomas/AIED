One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **sign-reversal trap associated with the concept of "opposites."**

In introductory algebra, students spend a significant amount of time learning that to "undo" an operation or reach a specific identity, they must change the sign (e.g., $5 + (-5) = 0$). This creates a strong mental association between the idea of "reciprocals" and "opposite signs."

When faced with this problem, a student may correctly identify that the fraction must be flipped to $\frac{4}{3}$ to achieve the magnitude of $1$, but then incorrectly apply the "opposite sign" rule used in addition. They mistakenly believe that because the first term is negative, the second term must be positive to "balance it out" or "cancel it," leading them to choose **Option A ($4/3$)** instead of the correct **Option B ($-4/3$)**. 

This error occurs because the student is over-generalizing the properties of **additive inverses** (where signs must be different) to a problem involving **multiplicative inverses** (where signs must be the same to result in a positive product).
