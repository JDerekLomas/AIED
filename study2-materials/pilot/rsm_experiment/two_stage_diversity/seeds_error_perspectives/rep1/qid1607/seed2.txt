One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **misinterpretation of inverse operations in Step 2, driven by the visual positioning of the numbers.**

In Step 1 ($60 = 1 + k$), the equation presents as a standard addition expression. A student may correctly identify that they need to "move" the 1 to the other side of the equals sign. However, instead of applying the mathematical inverse (subtracting 1 from 60), students frequently perform a **"closeness operation"** or follow a **pseudo-rule** regarding the plus sign.

Specifically:
1.  **Operation Sign Bias:** The student sees the $+$ symbol between the $1$ and the $k$. Instead of thinking "I must do the opposite of adding 1," they think "The rule is to add," leading them to add $60 + 1$ to get $61$.
2.  **Number Commutativity Confusion:** In the expression $1 + k$, the number 1 is a "floating" constant. Because it precedes the variable and is followed by a plus sign, students often subconsciously group the addition sign with the $60$ rather than recognizing it as part of the term to be subtracted from $60$.

This error makes the question particularly "tricky" because the student successfully navigated the complex first step (multiplying by 4), giving them a false sense of confidence that leads them to rush the conceptually simpler arithmetic in Step 2.
