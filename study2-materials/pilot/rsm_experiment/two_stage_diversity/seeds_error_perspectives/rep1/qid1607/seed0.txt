One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **"directional interference" error regarding inverse operations** in Step 2.

In Step 1, the student correctly identifies that they must multiply by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). However, when transitioning to Step 2, students often perform the "stronger" or most recently used operation (addition) rather than the required inverse operation (subtraction). 

Specifically, seeing the equation $60 = 1 + k$, the student's brain focuses on the numbers **60 and 1**. Because they see an addition sign ($+$) and just finished an operation that increased the value of the numbers (multiplication), they reflexively perform $60 + 1$ to get $61$ instead of $60 - 1$ to get $59$. 

This is a specific notational trap where the **proximity of the plus sign to the number 1** cues the student to add, leading them to believe Step 2 is correct when it is actually where the error occurs. Many students will select **C (Both steps are correct)** because 61 "feels" like the logical numerical successor to 60 in a sequence of operations, failing to recognize the change in sign required by algebraic balancing.
