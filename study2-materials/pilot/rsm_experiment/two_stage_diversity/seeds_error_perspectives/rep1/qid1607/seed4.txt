One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **notational trap** regarding the "invisible parentheses" in the numerator of Step 2.

Many students struggle with the order of operations when moving from Step 1 ($60 = 1 + k$) to Step 2 ($61 = k$) because of the **cognitive association between "isolating $k$" and the "inverse operation" of the visible number.**

In Step 1, the student correctly identified the inverse of division by 4. However, in Step 2, students frequently suffer from a **sign-action mismatch**. Because the $1$ and the $k$ are separated by a plus sign ($+$), students intuitively know they need to "do something with the 1." Instead of subtracting $1$ from $60$ to isolate $k$ (the mathematically correct inverse), they often see the "1" and the "+" and mentally "combine" it with the $60$ through addition ($60 + 1 = 61$).

This error is exacerbated by the visual layout:
*   The student identifies that Step 1 is "correct math."
*   In the transition to Step 2, they see the number $1$ and the result $61$ and find it **computationally satisfying** ($60+1$ is an easier mental operation than $60-1$).
*   This leads many students to select **Option C** because they mistake "logical-looking numbers" (60, 61) for "logically sound steps."
