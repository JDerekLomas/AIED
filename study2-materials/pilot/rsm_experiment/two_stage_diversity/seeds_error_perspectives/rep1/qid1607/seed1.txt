One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **"misapplied inverse" error in Step 2**, rooted in the visual proximity of the numbers 60 and 1.

While many students successfully perform the multiplication in Step 1 ($15 \times 4 = 60$), they often stumble on the final step because they see the "1" and "60" and instinctively perform the addition operation visible in the original expression ($1 + k$) rather than applying the necessary inverse operation (subtraction).

In this specific case:
*   **The Trap:** Students see $+1$ and, wanting to "solve" for $k$, they combine 60 and 1 to get 61.
*   **The Conceptual Confusion:** They interpret "moving the 1 to the other side" as a reason to perform the operation shown ($60 + 1$) rather than balancing the equation by subtracting 1 from both sides ($60 - 1$).
*   **Difficulty:** A student may select **Option C** because the jump from 60 to 61 "looks" mathematically plausible if they are focused on combining terms rather than maintaining the equality, making it harder to detect the error in Step 2.
