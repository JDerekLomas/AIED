One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a common **visual/procedural trap in Step 2 involving the "Change-the-Side, Change-the-Sign" heuristic.**

Students who successfully navigate Step 1 by multiplying by 4 often reach the correct intermediate equation: $60 = 1 + k$. However, when tasked with isolating $k$, many students reflexively perform an addition instead of a subtraction. 

The cognitive error stems from two specific triggers in the notation:
1.  **Additive Priming:** The presence of the plus sign ($+$) in " $1 + k$ " encourages the student to continue the "theme" of addition, leading them to mentally calculate $60 + 1$ rather than the inverse operation ($60 - 1$).
2.  **Directional Bias:** Because the variable $k$ is on the right-hand side, students may try to "move" the 1 to the left. If they follow a shallow rule-of-thumb that "numbers belong with numbers," they may simply combine 60 and 1 to get 61 without correctly applying the property of equality (subtracting 1 from both sides).

This makes the question a powerful diagnostic tool; it specifically isolates whether a student understands **inverse operations** or is simply performing "number-crunching" based on the visible signs. In this case, the student in the prompt made that exact error in Step 2, making **Choice A** the correct answer.
