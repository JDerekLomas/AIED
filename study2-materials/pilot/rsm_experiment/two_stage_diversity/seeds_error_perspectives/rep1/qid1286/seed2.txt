One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **failure to perform the multiplicative inversion of the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ during the algebraic rearrangement.**

To solve for the radius ($r$), a student must rearrange the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. A common cognitive trap occurs in the step where the student needs to "move" the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ to the other side of the equation. 

Specifically:
*   **The Error:** Many students see the 3 in the denominator and the 4 in the numerator and, under exam pressure, associate the number 4 with the numerator of the result simply because it is the "leading" number. This leads them to incorrectly multiply $V$ by $\frac{4}{3}$ instead of $\frac{3}{4}$, drawing them toward **Distractor A** ($\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V\pi}{3}}$) or **Distractor B** ($\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}$).
*   **Why it happens:** In early algebra, students are taught to "divide by the coefficient." When the coefficient is a fraction, students often struggle with the multi-step process of multiplying by the reciprocal. They may correctly divide by $\pi$, but then "slap" the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ onto the $V$ without flipping it, failing to recognize that dividing by $\frac{4}{3}$ is equivalent to multiplying by $\frac{3}{4}$. 

**Distractor B** is a particularly strong trap because it correctly identifies that $\pi$ should be in the denominator, making the student feel they are on the right track even though the constants $3$ and $4$ are inverted.
