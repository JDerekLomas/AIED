One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **failure to perform the inverse operation of multiplication on a fraction**.

Specifically, when isolating $r^3$ from the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, many students struggle to move the coefficient $\frac{4}{3}$ to the other side of the equation. A common procedural error is to multiply the $V$ by the numerator and divide by the denominator (associating "4" with multiplication because it is on top), leading them to calculate $4V \div 3$. 

This results in the term $\frac{4V}{3\pi}$, leading directly to the distractor **Option B**.

To correctly solve the expression, the student must recognize that they are dividing by $\frac{4}{3}$ (or multiplying by the reciprocal $\frac{3}{4}$). This requires a high level of comfort with "literal equations" where students cannot rely on numerical intuition and must instead precisely apply the rule that to undo the coefficient $\frac{4}{3}$, the 3 must move to the numerator of the opposite side ($3V$) and the 4 must move to the denominator ($4\pi$). This specific algebraic "flip" is a notorious bottleneck in middle-secondary mathematics.
