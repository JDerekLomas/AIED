As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the following specific reason why students find this question difficult:

### The "Co-efficient Inversion" Trap in Rearranging Formulae

A common specific point of failure is the algebraic step where students must move the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ to the other side of the equation $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. 

When a formula involves a fraction as a coefficient, students frequently struggle with the **multiplicative inverse**. Many students operate under a "visual transposition" rule rather than applying the inverse operation. In this specific problem:

1.  **The Error:** A student may correctly recognize they need to divide by the coefficients of $r^3$, but when dealing with a fraction and a constant ($\frac{4}{3}$ and $\pi$), they often fail to treat them as a single term. They may try to move the numbers individually, leading to common misplacements like $4V$ or $3\pi$ appearing in the wrong part of the fraction.
2.  **The Distractor:** This makes **Option B** ($\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}}$) a highly effective trap. A student might simply "drag" the $\pi$ underneath the $V$ and then attach the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ as it appeared in the original formula without inverting it. 

**Why it's a specific difficulty:** The transition from $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ to $\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$ requires the student to simultaneously multiply by the reciprocal (3) and divide by the product ($4\pi$). Students who lack "structural sense" often perform these steps sequentially and lose track of which values belong in the numerator versus the denominator, ultimately choosing Option B because it "looks" most like the original components of the sphere volume formula.
