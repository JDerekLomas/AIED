A specific reason students find this question difficult is the **fractional division error** that occurs during the transition from the formula to the isolated radius.

The formula for the volume of a sphere is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. To solve for $r$, students must divide by the coefficient $\frac{4\pi}{3}$. A common error at this step is a "reciprocal confusion": students mistakenly multiply by the existing coefficient or fail to correctly invert the fraction when moving it to the other side of the equation.

**Why this is a trap in this specific question:**
Because the coefficient $\frac{4}{3}\pi$ involves both a fraction and the constant $\pi$, students often correctly move the $3$ to the numerator (getting $3V$) but then struggle with where $\pi$ should land. 

*   **Option A** ($\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}}$) targets the student who incorrectly moves the $\pi$ and the $4$ as multipliers rather than divisors.
*   **Option B** ($\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}}$) targets the student who forgets to invert the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ and simply "drags" the numbers across the equals sign.

This notational complexity makes **Option C** difficult to reach because it requires three distinct algebraic maneuvers (multiplying by 3, dividing by 4, and dividing by $\pi$) to be performed perfectly before the cube root is applied.
