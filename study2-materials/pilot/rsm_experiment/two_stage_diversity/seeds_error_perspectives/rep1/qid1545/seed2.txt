One specific reason students find this question difficult is the **visual "Gestalt" trap of the identical numerator string.**

A student’s eye naturally groups the sequence of numbers $(8+12)$ before their brain applies formal Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). In this expression, both sides contain the exact same numbers in the same order ($8, 12, 4$). 

**The specific error:**
Students often fall victim to **"pattern matching"** rather than calculation. Because the left side looks like a "loose" version of the right side, students frequently perceive the expression as:
1.  See $8+12$ on the left.
2.  See $(8+12)$ on the right.
3.  Assume they must be the same total ($20$) being divided by $4$ because the components are identical.

This leads them to conclude the answer is **C) =** without performing the division. They fail to notice that on the left, the division ($12 \div 4$) is "stronger" and binds the $4$ only to the $12$, whereas on the right, the parentheses force the division to apply to the sum of $20$. 

The presence of the same digits in the same sequence creates a psychological "false symmetry" that masks the operational priority.
