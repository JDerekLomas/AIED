One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **visual trap** known as **"operator precedence overshadowing"** (or a fixation on the "Distributed Law" pattern).

Specifically, many students will incorrectly choose **C) =** because the expressions on both sides contain identical numbers (8, 12, and 4) and identical operators ($+$ and $\div$).

Visually, the presence of the parentheses on the right side triggers a partial recall of the **Distributive Property**—the idea that $(a+b) \div c$ is equivalent to $a \div c + b \div c$. A student may "see" that the 12 and 4 are being divided on both sides and incorrectly assume the 8 is also being divided on the left side by proximity, even though there are no parentheses to justify it. 

The student fails to process that on the left side, the division $\div 4$ only "clings" to the 12 (due to Order of Operations/PEMDAS), whereas on the right side, the division is "shared" by both the 8 and the 12. The structural similarity of the numbers creates a cognitive shortcut that leads them to bypass the actual calculation ($8 + 3 = 11$ vs. $20 \div 4 = 5$) in favor of an assumed equivalence.
