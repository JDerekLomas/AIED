One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "Gestalt" trap of the repeated digits**, which triggers an incorrect application of the distributive property.

Specifically, students often see the sequence $(8+12) \div 4$ on the right and mistakenly believe the left side is simply the same expression written without parentheses. They mentally process $8+12 \div 4$ as a single unit where the $\div 4$ applies to the entire sum $(8+12)$ rather than just the $12$.

**The Specific Error:**
A student may perform a "visual matching" shortcut rather than a computational one. Because both sides contain the digits $8, 12,$ and $4$ in the same order, and both involve addition and division, the student may perceive the left side as an "informal" version of the right side. This lead them to select **C) $=$**. 

This error is exacerbated by the way we speak the expressions aloud:
*   **Left:** "Eight plus twelve... divided by four."
*   **Right:** "Eight plus twelve, divided by four."

If a student pauses slightly after "twelve" when reading the left side, they mentally group the addition first, violating the Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BIDMAS). They fail to see that on the left, the $8$ is "isolated" from the division, whereas on the right, it is "captured" by the parentheses. This results in the incorrect comparison of $11 \square 5$ being viewed as $5 \square 5$.
