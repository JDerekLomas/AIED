One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "Gestalt" trap of identical number sequences**, which leads to an intuitive (but incorrect) assumption of equality.

**The Notational Trap:**
The question presents the exact same digits ($8, 12, 4$) in the exact same horizontal order on both sides of the box. For students who have not fully internalized order of operations as a "filtering" process, the visual symmetry of the strings $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$ creates a cognitive bias toward **Option C (=)**. 

**The Specific Error:**
Many students process mathematical expressions from left to right as if reading a sentence. In this specific problem:
1.  On the **right side**, the parentheses force the addition first: $(8+12) = 20 \rightarrow 20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.
2.  On the **left side**, the "left-to-right" bias causes the student to ignore the hierarchy of operations. They perform $8+12$ first simply because it appears first spatially. This yields $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.

Because the student arrives at $5$ for both sides using the same (incorrect) left-to-right strategy, the presence of the parentheses on the right looks like "redundant" notation rather than a functional operator. The student concludes that since the numbers are the same and their "running total" is the same, the expressions must be equal. They fail to realize the left side requires division first ($12 \div 4 = 3$), leading to $8+3 = \mathbf{11}$.
