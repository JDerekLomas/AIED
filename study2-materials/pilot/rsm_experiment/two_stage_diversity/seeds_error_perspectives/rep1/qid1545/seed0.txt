One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "Gestalt" trap of the repeated digits**, which triggers an incorrect application of the distributive property.

Specifically, because the numbers 8 and 12 appear on both sides of the box in the same order, students often fail to perform the arithmetic and instead look for a "pattern rule." They may mistakenly believe the **Distributive Property** makes these expressions equivalent ($11 = 11$).

**The Mental Error:**
A student may see $(8+12) \div 4$ and recall that "division distributes over addition." They then look at $8+12 \div 4$ and subconsciously "pull" the division sign across both numbers as if there were invisible parentheses, concluding that both sides represent "8 divided by 4 plus 12 divided by 4." 

**Why this is a specific trap in this question:**
Unlike many order-of-operations problems where the numbers change (e.g., $2 + 3 \times 4$), the symmetry of $8$ and $12$ here reinforces the illusion of equality. A student who relies on "visual matching" rather than strict algorithmic processing will likely choose **C (=)** because they perceive the second expression as merely a "grouped version" of the first, ignoring that in the first expression, the $8$ is entirely isolated from the divisor.
