As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify the most significant difficulty in this question as the **"Division is Commutative" misconception**, specifically triggered by the visual orientation of the fraction.

### The Specific Difficulty: The Symmetry Error
Students frequently struggle when the unknown ($p$) is the **divisor** (the denominator) rather than the **dividend** (the numerator). Many students intuitively treat division as if it follows the commutative property ($a \div b = b \div a$), similar to addition or multiplication.

**The Concrete Error Path:**
When a student sees $10 = \frac{5}{p}$, they often "read" the operation between the numbers $10$ and $5$ rather than performing the inverse algebraic steps. Because $10 \div 5 = 2$ is a highly familiar "math fact," the brain performs the operation that feels most natural and "whole." This leads them to mentally rearrange the equation to $p = 10 \div 5$, resulting in **Option C ($p=2$)**.

### Why this happens in this specific question:
1.  **Inverse Operation Confusion:** To solve this correctly, a student must perform a two-step mental process (multiply by $p$, then divide by $10$). To a novice, it is much more cognitively "expensive" to move the letter than to simply divide the two visible constants.
2.  **Number Saliency:** The numbers 5 and 10 have a strong divisor-multiple relationship. If the equation were $10 = \frac{3}{p}$, a student might pause because $10 \div 3$ isn't a "clean" integer. However, because $10$ and $5$ are factors of one another, the temptation to simply calculate $10 \div 5$ is significantly higher, masking the structural reality that $p$ is the denominator.

**Summary:** Students choose **C** because they mistakenly apply the logic of $p = \frac{10}{5}$ to the structure $10 = \frac{5}{p}$, favoring "clean" mental arithmetic over algebraic structure.
