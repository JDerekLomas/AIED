As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle in this question as the **"Division is Commutative" misconception**, specifically triggered by the "Big over Small" intuitive bias.

### The Specific Difficulty: The Directional Trap of Division
Students frequently struggle with equations where the variable is the **divisor** (the denominator) rather than the dividend (the numerator). Because subtraction and division are non-commutative, students often unconsciously "correct" the operation to make it easier to process.

**The concrete error process:**
When a student sees $10 = \frac{5}{p}$, they frequently perform the mental calculation $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$. This occurs for two specific reasons:

1.  **The "Larger Number First" Heuristic:** In early primary education, students are conditioned to believe that you "divide the big number by the small number." This mental shortcut persists into algebra. Confronted with 10 and 5, the student’s brain instinctively jumps to $10 \div 5 = 2$, leading them directly to **Distractor C**.
2.  **Mistranslating the Inverse Operation:** To isolate $p$, a student knows they must "undo" the division. However, instead of multiplying both sides by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, they incorrectly treat the 5 as the operator. They "move" the 5 by performing the inverse on the 10, calculating $10 \div 5$.

**The Visual Trap:**
The placement of $p$ underneath the fraction bar makes it "heavier" or less mobile in a student's mind. Many students see the 10 and the 5 on the "top level" of their visual field and perform the operation between those two numbers, essentially solving the phantom equation $p = \frac{10}{5}$ rather than the one provided.

**Result:**
Because **Option C ($p=2$)** is present, the student receives "False Confirmation." They see their intuitive (but incorrect) result reflected in the choices, which prevents them from re-evaluating their steps and checking if $10 = \frac{5}{2}$ is actually a true statement.
