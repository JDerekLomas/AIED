As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle in this problem as the **"Division is Commutative" misconception**, specifically triggered by the **size of the numbers.**

### The Specific Difficulty: "Big Divided by Small" Intuition

The primary reason students struggle with this specific equation is the ingrained cognitive bias that division must result in a smaller number, or more specifically, that you must always divide the larger number by the smaller number.

**The Cognitive Trap:**
When a student sees $10 = \frac{5}{p}$, their mathematical intuition often skips the formal algebraic step of multiplying by $p$. Instead, they look at the numbers $10$ and $5$ and instinctively search for a relationship between them. Because $10 \div 5 = 2$ is a much more "natural" and over-practiced arithmetic fact than $5 \div 10 = 0.5$, students will often flip the divisor and the dividend.

**The Step Where They Go Wrong:**
A student may correctly identify that they need to "do a division" to isolate $p$. However, rather than performing the correct algebraic transformation ($p = \frac{5}{10}$), they perform the "comfortable" division:
$$p = 10 \div 5$$
This leads them directly to **Option C ($p=2$)**, which is the most common distractor.

**Why this is specific to this problem:**
If the equation had been $2 = \frac{10}{p}$, a significantly higher percentage of students would get the answer right ($p=5$). In that case, the intuitive "Big $\div$ Small" shortcut ($10 \div 2$) happens to align with the correct algebraic procedure. In the $10 = \frac{5}{p}$ version, the shortcut fails, exposing the student's lack of a robust understanding of the reciprocal relationship between the variable in the denominator and the result of the equation.
