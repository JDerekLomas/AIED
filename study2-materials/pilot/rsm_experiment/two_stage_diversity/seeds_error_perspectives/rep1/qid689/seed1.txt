As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle in this question as the **"multiplication by reflex" trap caused by the placement of the larger integer on the left-hand side.**

### The Specific Reason: Operative Commutativity Bias
A common difficulty for students is a cognitive shortcut where they attempt to "combine" the two visible integers ($10$ and $5$) using the operation they associate most closely with fractions: multiplication.

**Why this occurs in this specific problem:**
1.  **The Coefficient Attraction:** Students often see an equation in the form $x = \frac{a}{b}$ and reflexively move to eliminate the denominator. However, because $10$ is a multiple of $5$, the brain favors a result that produces another whole number. 
2.  **Calculation vs. Structure:** Many students will mentally "move" the $5$ over to the $10$. Instead of performing the correct algebraic step (multiplying both sides by $p$ to get $10p = 5$), they incorrectly treat the equation as $p = 10 \times 5$. 
3.  **Distractor B ($p=50$):** This error leads directly to Option B. In student interviews, those who choose $50$ often explain their reasoning as "getting $p$ by itself by moving the $5$," revealing a failure to recognize that $p$ is a divisor, not a dividend.

**The Notational Trap:**
Because the equation starts with "$10 = \dots$", students who read left-to-right may process "10" and "5" before they process the fractional relationship of $p$. If the question were written as $\frac{5}{p} = 10$, students are slightly more likely to pause, but the "Big Number divided by Small Number" intuition is so strong that many will bypass the algebra entirely and simply perform $10 \div 5$ (leading to Option C) or $10 \times 5$ (leading to Option B). 

The difficulty lies in the **inverse relationship**—students struggle to grasp that as the result of the division ($10$) gets larger than the numerator ($5$), the denominator must be a value less than $1$.
