As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle in this question as the **"Commutative Misconception of Division,"** specifically manifesting in a **visual/notational trap** where students treat the operation as if it were $p \div 5$ rather than $5 \div p$.

### The Specific Difficulty: "The Larger-Divide-Smaller" Heuristic
Students frequently default to a mental shortcut where they automatically divide the larger number they see by the smaller one, regardless of their position in the equation.

**Why this occurs in this specific problem:**
1.  **Inverse Operation Error:** To solve for $p$, a student knows they need to "do something with 10 and 5." If they incorrectly attempt to "undo" the fraction by multiplying the constant by the numerator (rather than the denominator), they reach $10 \times 5 = 50$ (Option B).
2.  **Mental Computation Preference:** In earlier grades, division is often taught as "how many times does the small number fit into the big one?" When a student sees 10 and 5, their brain retrieves the dividend/divisor relationship $10 \div 5 = 2$. This leads them to conclude $p = 2$ (Option C) without actually performing the algebraic step of multiplying both sides by $p$.

### The Resulting Error
Option C ($p=2$) is the most potent distractor because it satisfies the "easiest" division path. The student fails to recognize that substituting $2$ back into the equation yields $10 = \frac{5}{2}$, which is $2.5$, not $10$. This difficulty is compounded by the **variable being in the denominator**, a notation that requires a two-step reciprocal process ($10p = 5$, then $p = \frac{5}{10}$) which many students bypass in favor of a single-step, intuitive (but incorrect) division.
