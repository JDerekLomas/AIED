One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **rigid, non-conceptual application of the "A" before "S" in the PEMDAS/BODMAS mnemonic.**

In Problem P ($4 - 5 + 6$), the specific difficulty lies in the mnemonic trap of "Addition before Subtraction." A student who has internalized the acronym literally—without understanding that addition and subtraction hold equal priority and should be performed from left to right—will be strongly drawn to **Option D**. 

They will believe they must calculate $5 + 6$ first because the letter 'A' (Addition) precedes 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym. This error is compounded by a visual "clumping" effect: the $+$ sign acts as a mental glue between the 5 and the 6, leading students to ignore the negative property of the 5 and incorrectly simplify the expression as if it were $4 - (5 + 6)$, resulting in $4 - 11 = -7$, rather than the correct $1 + 6 = 5$.
