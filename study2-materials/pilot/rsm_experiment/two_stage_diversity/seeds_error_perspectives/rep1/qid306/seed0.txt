As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **"Addition-before-Subtraction" (AS) literalism** within the PEMDAS/BODMAS mnemonic as the specific reason many students find this question—specifically **Problem P**—difficult.

### The Specific Difficulty: The Literal Interpretation of Order
Students frequently treat the order of operations as a **rigid vertical hierarchy** rather than a set of nested priorities. Because "A" (Addition) precedes "S" (Subtraction) in the mnemonic PEMDAS, or "A" precedes "S" in BODMAS, students develop a persistent misconception that addition must *always* be performed before subtraction, regardless of their position in the string.

**The Concrete Error in Problem P:**
A significant number of students will gravitate toward **Option D** because they look at \(4 - 5 + 6\) and feel cognitively compelled to group \(5 + 6\) first. This error is reinforced by two specific factors in this problem:

1.  **Visual "Plus" Salience:** The plus sign is often perceived as a "stronger" or "additive" operator that binds numbers together more tightly than the minus sign, leading students to simplify the expression to \(4 - 11\).
2.  **Semantic Mapping:** Students who have been taught "do addition then subtraction" will explicitly seek out the \(+\) symbol first as a procedural rule-of-thumb, failing to realize that addition and subtraction hold equal priority and must be solved via the **Left-to-Right convention**.

### Why this is a "Notational Trap"
In **Problem Q**, the mnemonic works in the student's favor because Multiplication *is* higher priority than Addition. However, by pairing Q with P, the question exposes whether a student actually understands **operational hierarchy** versus **acronym-following**. A student who chooses **Option D** is applying the exact same logic to both problems ("Addition comes first alphabetically/in the mnemonic"), which is a mathematically sound interpretation of a flawed pedagogical tool.
