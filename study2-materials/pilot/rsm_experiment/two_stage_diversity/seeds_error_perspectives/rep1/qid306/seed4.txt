One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **linguistic ambiguity of the "Addition before Subtraction" rule** in PEMDAS/BODMAS mnemonics, which leads to a "visual clustering" error in Problem P.

Specifically, in **Problem P ($4-5+6$)**, many students incorrectly select option **C or D (stating $5+6$ must be done first)** because the letter **A** (Addition) precedes the letter **S** (Subtraction) in the acronym. This creates a cognitive trap where students view the plus sign as a "higher priority" command regardless of its position.

**The Notational Trap:**
Visually, the student sees the sub-expression $5+6$ as a stable unit. They often ignore the negative sign (operator) attached to the $5$, treating the problem as $4 - (5+6)$ rather than working from left to right. This is a "common shortcut" that fails here because, while Addition and Subtraction hold equal priority in reality, the linear nature of the mnemonic suggests a rigid hierarchy that does not exist. 

Consequently, a student may correctly identify that Multiplication comes first in Problem Q (applying the mnemonic successfully), but then over-apply that same hierarchical logic to Problem P, leading them to choose **D** instead of the correct **B**.
