A primary reason students find this question difficult is the **“Addition-before-Subtraction” literalism** (a specific misunderstanding of the order of operations acronyms like PEMDAS or BODMAS), which acts as a **visual/notational trap** in Problem P.

**The Specific Error:**
Many students interpret the "A" appearing before "S" in PEMDAS (or "A" before "S" in BODMAS) as a rigid hierarchy rather than a left-to-right priority. In Problem P ($4 - 5 + 6$), this leads them to prioritize the $5 + 6$ operation.

**Why this specific question triggers it:**
1.  **Spatial Alignment:** In the expression $4 - 5 + 6$, the $5$ and $6$ are physically adjacent and separated by a plus sign. To a student following a literal mnemonic, "Add before Subtract" provides a clear directive to skip the $4 - 5$ and join the $5$ and $6$ first.
2.  **The Misleading Correctness Trap:** If a student incorrectly chooses option **D** ($5+6$ first for P), they might arrive at the result $4 - 11 = -7$. Because the distractors in the multiple-choice format (Options C and D) explicitly offer $5+6$ as a valid starting move for P, it validates their misconception that addition is a standalone "higher tier" operation than subtraction.

In contrast, while students usually find the multiplication in Problem Q ($5 \times 6$) easy to prioritize, the same student will often fail Problem P because they do not realize that addition and subtraction hold **equal priority** and must be performed from left to right. This makes Option B the correct, but counter-intuitive, choice for those overly reliant on the acronym's letter order.
