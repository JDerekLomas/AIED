One specific reason why students often find this question difficult is due to a **"Literal Interpretion of the Order of Operations Acronym" (specifically the "A" before "S" in PEMDAS/BODMAS)**, which acts as a visual and linguistic trap in **Problem P**.

### The Specific Mechanism of Error:
In Problem P (\(4 - 5 + 6\)), students frequently select **Option D** because they have been taught the acronym PEMDAS (or BODMAS/BIDMAS) where **A** (Addition) precedes **S** (Subtraction). This leads to a rigid, hierarchical misconception that all addition must be completed before any subtraction, regardless of their position in the expression.

### Why this is a "Trap" in this specific problem:
1.  **The Overgeneralization Rule:** Students mentally "cluster" the \(5 + 6\) first because "Addition comes first" in the mnemonic.
2.  **The Misleading Operator Association:** A student looks at \(4 - 5 + 6\) and sees the \(+\) sign between the 5 and the 6. If they calculate this first (\(5 + 6 = 11\)), they are then forced into the calculation \(4 - 11 = -7\). 
3.  **Conflict with "Left-to-Right" processing:** Mathematically, addition and subtraction hold equal priority and should be performed from left to right (\(4 - 5 = -1\), then \(-1 + 6 = 5\)). The acronym provides a "false shortcut" that contradicts the standard convention of left-to-right evaluation.

Because **Problem Q** clearly adheres to the standard hierarchy (Multiplication before Addition), it acts as a "distractor" of sorts—students might feel confident about Q and let that confidence blind them to the subtle directional rule required for P, ultimately leading them to choose **Option D** over the correct **Option B**.
