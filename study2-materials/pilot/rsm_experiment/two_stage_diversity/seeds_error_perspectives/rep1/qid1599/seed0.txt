One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "left-to-right" placement trap**, which frequently leads students to choose **Option D**.

In algebra, the vinculum (the horizontal fraction bar) serves a dual purpose as both an operation symbol ($\div$) and a grouping symbol. However, many students internalize the transformation from $\div$ to a fraction as a "falling over" motion or a spatial rearrangement. 

In this specific case, the expression $(h+4)$ contains three distinct characters and a set of parentheses, making it "heavier" and more visually complex than the single variable $c$. Students who struggle with **directionality in notation** or who misapply the commutative property often subconsciously place the "larger" or more complex expression on the top of the fraction, mistakenly producing $\frac{h+4}{c}$. This error is compounded if the student reads the original expression as "putting $c$ into $h+4$" (focusing on the container rather than the dividend), causing them to reverse the numerator and denominator.
