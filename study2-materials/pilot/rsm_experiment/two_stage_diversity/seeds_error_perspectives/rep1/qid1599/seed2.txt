One specific reason students find this question difficult is the **visual "bracket-stripping" trap** inherent in option **C (\(\frac{c}{h}+4\))**.

In introductory algebra, students are taught that the vinculum (the fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol, essentially replacing the need for parentheses. However, students who possess an incomplete understanding of this "invisible bracket" rule often apply a literal, left-to-right processing of the symbols.

When a student reads \(c \div (h+4)\), they see the division sign immediately followed by \(h\). In the transition to fraction notation, they may correctly place \(c\) over \(h\), but then "drop" the remaining \(+4\) outside the fraction because they visually associate the parentheses only with the act of division, not with the entirety of the denominator. They perceive the $+4$ as a separate "tail" to the calculation rather than a structural part of the divisor. This error is compounded if the student has recently practiced the Distributive Law, as they may mistakenly feel that the division should only "hit" the first term inside the brackets.
