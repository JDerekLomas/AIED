One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual trap of the "missing parentheses" in fraction notation**.

In algebra, the horizontal fraction bar (the vinculum) acts as a **grouping symbol** that inherently replaces parentheses. Students are often taught that \( (h+4) \) must be kept together because of the brackets in the original expression \( c \div(h+4) \). When they look at Option A, the explicit parentheses disappear.

This creates a cognitive conflict for two types of students:
1. **The Over-Generalizer:** A student who has been strictly trained that "brackets must be resolved first" may search for an answer that still contains physical parentheses. Seeing \( \frac{c}{h+4} \) without them may lead them to believe the expression has been changed, potentially driving them toward an incorrect choice that "looks" more complex.
2. **The "Order of Operations" Literalists:** These students may struggle to recognize that the vinculum creates an implicit grouping. They may look at Option C (\( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)) and mistake it for the correct answer because they visually prioritize the division sign $(\div)$ becoming a small fraction $(\frac{c}{h})$ and treat the $+4$ as an afterthought, failing to realize that the fraction bar in Option A must extend under the entire binomial to maintain the grouping of the divisor.
