One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual trap of the grouping symbols in the denominator**, which often leads to the selection of **Option C**.

In primary school, students are taught to follow the left-to-right Order of Operations (BIDMAS/PEMDAS). When translating a horizontal expression into a vertical fraction, students frequently "shed" the parentheses as they feel they have dealt with the grouping. Without the visual barrier of the brackets, many students default to treating the division sign as a local operator that only applies to the term immediately following it (\(c \div h\)), subsequently viewing the \(+ 4\) as a separate term.

This leads to the **linear-to-fractional translation error**: they process the string \(c\), \(\div\), \(h\), and then \(+4\) as discrete steps. They correctly turn \(c \div h\) into \(\frac{c}{h}\), but then simply append the \(+4\) to the end of the expression rather than seeing the entire group \((h+4)\) as a single divisor. Consequently, they fail to recognize the vinculum (fraction bar) as a grouping symbol that replaces the need for parentheses.
