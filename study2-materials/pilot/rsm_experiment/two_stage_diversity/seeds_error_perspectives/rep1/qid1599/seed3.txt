One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual trap of the "Vinculum Length" in Distributive Notation (Choice C).**

In algebra, the fraction bar (vinculum) acts as a grouping symbol, similar to brackets. A common misconception occurs when students fail to recognize that the division operator applies to the *entire* expression following it \((h+4)\).

Students often follow a "Left-to-Right" linear processing habit rather than a structural one. They see \( c \div h \) as the primary action and perceive the \( +4 \) as a secondary addition at the end of the chain. This leads them to Choice C: \( \frac{c}{h} + 4 \).

Because the original expression uses brackets to explicitly group \( h+4 \), the student must translate a **horizontal grouping** (the parentheses) into a **vertical grouping** (the length of the fraction bar). Students who struggle with this "spatial translation" of operator precedence often select Choice C because it preserves the linear order of symbols (\( c \), then \( h \), then \( 4 \)) better than the correct compact notation.
