One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **notation-dependent interpretation of negative bases**, specifically the ambiguity between $-3^4$ and $(-3)^4$.

Even if a student understands that they must multiply the number four times, many mistakenly follow a "Left-to-Right" or "Sign-Last" mental model similar to how a standard scientific calculator processes input. When a student substitutes $-3$ into the formula, they often visualize or write the expression as:
$$T = -3^4$$
In mathematical convention (PEMDAS/BODMAS), the exponentiation happens before the negation. This leads the student to calculate $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$ and then apply the negative sign at the very end, resulting in **Option C (-81)**.

The "trap" is that the question requires the student to realize that $k$ is a single unit being raised to a power, necessitating implicit parentheses: $(-3)^4$. Students who fail to "bracket" the negative sign fail to cancel out the negatives in pairs (i.e., realizing that a negative times a negative is a positive), making this a test of **algebraic substitution conventions** rather than just arithmetic ability.
