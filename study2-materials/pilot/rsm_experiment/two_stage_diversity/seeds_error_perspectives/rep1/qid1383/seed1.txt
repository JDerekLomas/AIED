A primary reason students find this question difficult is the **notational ambiguity of the negative sign in relation to the exponent**, specifically leading to **Option C (-81)**.

### The Specific Step: Substitutional Misinterpretation
When students substitute a negative value like \(k = -3\) into a power, they frequently fail to conceptually or notationally "parenthesize" the base. This leads to a confusion between two different operations:
1.  **Correct interpretation:** \((-3)^4\), which means \((-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81\).
2.  **The Error path:** \(-3^4\), which many students process as \( - (3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3) = -81\).

### Why this happens in this specific question:
The variable \(k\) represents the *entire* value \(-3\). However, when students mentally or physically write down the calculation, the minus sign often "detaches" from the digit. They apply the exponent of 4 to the absolute value (the 3) first and then re-attach the negative sign at the end. 

This error is exacerbated by a "surface-level" application of the rule: *"A negative number raised to an even power is positive."* While students may know this rule, the visual habit of reading \(-3^4\) as "negative 3-to-the-fourth" often overrides the rule during the execution of the calculation, leading them directly to the "trap" answer of -81.
