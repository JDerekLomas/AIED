One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **notation-dependency of the negative sign when applying an even exponent.**

In many pedagogical contexts, students are taught that squaring or "powering" a negative number requires parentheses to keep the negative sign associated with the base (i.e., $(-3)^4$). However, when a variable like $k$ is replaced by a value like $-3$, students often mentally or physically perform the substitution as:
$$T = -3^4$$
According to the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), exponents are processed before multiplication by the implicit $-1$. Therefore, many students will calculate $3^4 = 81$ and then apply the negative sign to get **$-81$ (Option C)**. 

The "trap" lies in the conceptual transition from variable substitution to numerical calculation: students fail to realize that the variable $k$ acts as a "container" for the entire value $-3$. While the mathematically correct interpretation of $k^4$ when $k=-3$ is $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$, the common instructional shorthand of "substituting the number where the letter was" frequently leads to the visually familiar but incorrect $-3^4$.
