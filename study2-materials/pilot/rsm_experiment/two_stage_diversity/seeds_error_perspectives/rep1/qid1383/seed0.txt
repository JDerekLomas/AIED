One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **notation of "implied" vs "explicit" grouping when substituting a negative number into a power.**

When a student sees $T = k^4$ and substitutes $k = -3$, they must mentally decide whether the negative sign is part of the base being raised to the power ($(-3)^4$) or an operator applied after the exponentiation ($-3^4$).

Many students translate the substitution literally as written symbols on a page: **$-3^4$**. In mathematical syntax, most scientific calculators and standard order-of-operations conventions treat $-3^4$ as $-(3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3) = -81$. To get the correct answer of $81$, the student must proactively introduce parentheses—$(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$—to ensure the negative sign is squared and then squared again.

Because students are often taught that "even powers result in positive numbers," they may instinctively choose **A (81)**, but those who are strictly following a "substitution then calculation" rule on a calculator without using parentheses will be led directly to the distractor **C (-81)**.
