One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **notation-dependency of the negative sign in relation to the exponent**, leading to Option C.

Even students who understand that $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$ often fall into a "notational trap" when translating the substitution into a calculation. When a student replaces $k$ with $-3$, they may mentally or physically write the expression as $-3^4$.

In mathematical convention, exponents have precedence over negation (multiplication by $-1$). Therefore:
*   $(-3)^4 = 81$ (The negative is part of the base being squared).
*   $-3^4 = -(3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3) = -81$ (The base is $3$, and the result is negated afterward).

Many students treat the variable $k$ as a "bucket" but fail to realize that substituting a negative value into a power requires implicit parentheses. Because their calculators or their mental "order of operations" logic might process $-3^4$ as $-(3^4)$, they conclude the answer is $-81$, erroneously applying the rule that "a negative stays negative" or misinterpreting the priority of the sign.
