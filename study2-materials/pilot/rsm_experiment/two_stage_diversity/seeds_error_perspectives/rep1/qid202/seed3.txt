One specific reason why students might find this question difficult involves the **denominator-summation error**, which leads directly to the distractor **Option D (\(3 \frac{3}{10}\))**.

In fraction addition, students often overgeneralize the rule for multiplication (where you multiply both numerators and denominators) or apply their intuition of whole-number addition to every part of the fraction. Specifically, a student may correctly add the whole numbers (\(2+1=3\)) and correctly add the numerators (\(1+2=3\)), but then mistakenly add the denominators (\(5+5=10\)).

This is a specific **notational trap**: because the plus sign is perceived as an operation acting on all components of the numbers, students treat the denominator as a quantity to be combined rather than as the "unit" or "name" of the fraction parts. In this specific question, the presence of Option D serves as a "confirmation trap" for this error, making students less likely to rethink their process since their incorrect result is explicitly listed as an answer choice.
