One specific reason why students might find this question difficult relates to a **notational trap regarding the denominators during addition.**

Specifically, students often succumb to the **"Add-Across" error**, where they treat the numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers. In this case, a student would correctly add the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and the numerators ($1 + 2 = 3$), but then erroneously add the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$).

This leads them directly to **Distractor D ($3 \frac{3}{10}$)**.

The presence of the common denominator ($5$) actually increases the likelihood of this error compared to a problem with unlike denominators. Because the students do not need to perform the difficult step of finding a Least Common Multiple, they often fall into a "autopilot" processing mode where they apply the addition operation to every digit visible in the fraction, failing to recognize the denominator as the fixed unit of measure (the "size" of the slice) rather than a quantity to be summed.
