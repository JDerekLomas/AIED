One specific reason why students might find this question difficult involves **the "Addition of Denominators" trap**, which leads specifically to **Option D**.

Students who struggle with the conceptual understanding of a denominator as a "unit size" rather than a standalone whole number often treat the calculation as four independent addition operations. A student using this flawed logic will:
1.  Add the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = \mathbf{3}$)
2.  Add the numerators ($1 + 2 = \mathbf{3}$)
3.  **Add the denominators ($5 + 5 = \mathbf{10}$)**

This error is highly persistent because it mirrors the intuitive "left-to-right" processing used in whole-number addition. Because the numerators in this specific problem ($1$ and $2$) are small and do not result in an improper fraction when combined, the student is not forced to reconsider their method via regrouping. 

Option D ($3 \frac{3}{10}$) acts as a strong "attractive distractor" because it confirms the student’s incorrect procedural execution at every step, making them feel confident in an answer that fundamentally misunderstands the fractional unit.
