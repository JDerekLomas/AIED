One specific reason why students might find this question difficult relates to a **notational trap** concerning the **common denominator**, specifically seen in the distraction of Option D.

**The "Double Addition" Error (Denominators):**
A common misconception among students at the late primary/early secondary level is the tendency to apply the same operation to both the numerators and the denominators when performing fraction addition. In this specific problem, a student may correctly add the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and the numerators ($1 + 2 = 3$), but then erroneously add the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$).

Because the denominators in the question are the same ($5$), it creates a psychological "symmetry" that makes **Option D ($3 \frac{3}{10}$)** an extremely high-frequency distractor. Students who rely on a procedure rather than an understanding of the fractional unit often feel that *every* number in the expression must be processed; leaving the $5$ as it is can feel like an incomplete step, leading them to produce the tenth as a result of "balancing" the operation.
