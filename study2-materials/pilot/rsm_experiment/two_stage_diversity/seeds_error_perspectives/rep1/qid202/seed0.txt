As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify the most significant difficulty in this question as the **"Denominator Summation Error,"** specifically in how it interacts with the provided distractors.

### The Specific Difficulty: The Temptation of Additive Operations on Denominators
A common conceptual hurdle for students is the tendency to apply a "blanket" additive rule to every digit they see in a fraction problem. While students may correctly add the whole numbers ($2+1=3$) and the numerators ($1+2=3$), many are drawn to adding the denominators ($5+5=10$) by sheer force of habit or perceived symmetry.

**The "Visual Trap" of Distractor D ($3 \frac{3}{10}$):**
Students who find this question difficult often suffer from a "consistent process" misconception—they believe that if an operation (addition) is applied to the numerators, it must also be applied to the denominators to be "fair." 

**Why this specific question triggers that error:**
*   **Vertical Alignment Thinking:** In standard column addition, you add every column. Students subconsciously treat the fractions like columns, leading them to $5+5=10$.
*   **Interference from Multiplication:** Students recently introduced to fraction multiplication (where you *do* multiply denominators) often overgeneralize this "operate on both parts" rule back to addition.
*   **Distractor Plausibility:** Distractor D ($3 \frac{3}{10}$) is "mathematically attractive" because it uses the correct whole number and the correct sum of numerators. For a student who is unsure of the rules, $3 \frac{3}{10}$ "looks" more calculated than $3 \frac{3}{5}$, which might appear "unfinished" because the 5 stayed the same.

**Conclusion:** Even though the denominators are common (which should make the problem "easy"), the existence of **Distractor D** exploits a fundamental misunderstanding of the unit (the fifth), turning a simple addition into a trap for students who rely on procedural "digit-adding" rather than proportional reasoning.
