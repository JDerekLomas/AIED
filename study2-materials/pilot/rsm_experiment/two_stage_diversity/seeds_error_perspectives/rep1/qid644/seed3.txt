One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conflict between "arithmetic sign rules" and "visual processing of subtraction symbols."**

Specifically, students frequently struggle to treat the minus sign as a property of the term (directed number) rather than just an operation between terms. When looking at the brackets $(2p-1)$ and $(3p-4)$, a student might correctly identify the multiplication required (1 × 4) but then struggle to resolve the signs.

The specific "trap" here is the **Double Negative Error vs. The Operational Misinterpretation**:

*   **The Operational Misinterpretation (leading to B):** Many students view the "−" purely as an instruction to subtract. They see "1" and "4," multiply them to get 4, and then "carry over" one of the subtraction signs from the original brackets, resulting in $-4$. They fail to see the operation as $(-1) \times (-4)$, instead viewing it as "the 1st minus, then $1 \times 4$."
*   **The Conceptual Jump to Addition (leading to C or D):** Because the student sees two minus signs in a horizontal string, their brain may trigger a "subtraction" or "combining" reflex rather than a "multiplication" reflex, leading them to add the absolute values (1 and 4) to get 5.

This is a specific notational trap where the **spatial proximity** of the two minus signs in the brackets can cause a "cognitive overload," leading the student to ignore the multiplication instruction of the expansion and perform an additive operation instead.
