A specific reason why students often struggle with this question is the **misapplication of "integer sign rules" during a transition from addition to multiplication.**

Specifically, students frequently confuse the rules for **adding** two negative numbers with the rules for **multiplying** two negative numbers.

In this problem, a student must calculate $(-1) \times (-4)$.
*   **The correct multiplication rule:** A negative times a negative equals a positive $(+4)$.
*   **The "Addition" Trap:** When students see two negative numbers, their brains often default to the rule for addition: "a negative and a negative make a bigger negative" (e.g., $-1 - 4 = -5$).

This makes **Option D ($-5$)** a particularly powerful "visual-notational trap." Because the student sees a $1$ and a $4$ preceded by minus signs, they are reflexively drawn to the sum of those digits ($5$) while retaining the negative sign. This error is compounded by the "expansion" context, where students are mentally juggling multiple operations (multiplying coefficients while simultaneously tracking signs), leading to a cognitive overload where they revert to the most basic—but incorrect—operation for the signs provided.
