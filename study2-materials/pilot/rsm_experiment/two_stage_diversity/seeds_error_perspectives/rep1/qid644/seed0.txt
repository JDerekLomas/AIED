One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conflict between "operational" and "directional" rules for negative signs**, leading them to choose **Option D (-5)**.

Specifically, when students see two negative numbers ($-1$ and $-4$), they often revert to "additive thinking" even when the context is clearly multiplication. In early pre-algebra, students are drilled on the idea that "if you lose 1 and then lose 4, you have lost 5." 

Because the FOIL/expansion method requires the student to switch fluently between **multiplication** (finding the term) and **addition** (combining like terms later), many students experience "rule pollution." They see the minus signs and mentally perform $-1 - 4$, resulting in $-5$. This is a particularly strong distractor here because the numbers 1 and 4 "fit" into the number 5, making that option feel more mathematically intuitive than the correct product of 4.
