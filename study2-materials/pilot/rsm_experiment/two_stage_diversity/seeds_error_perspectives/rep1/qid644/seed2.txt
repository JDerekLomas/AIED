A specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conflict between "additive" and "multiplicative" processing of signs.**

While students may correctly identify that the arrows represent the "Last" part of FOIL, they often commit an error in how they combine the numerical values $-1$ and $-4$. 

**The Error: Misapplying Additive Logic (Leading to Distractors C and D)**
In introductory algebra, students spend a significant amount of time practicing the addition and subtraction of directed numbers (integers). When seeing two negative numbers grouped together—particularly two "small" ones like $-1$ and $-4$—the brain often defaults to a "combine" or "accumulation" heuristic. 

*   A student might think: "A negative 1 and a negative 4 together make a bigger negative, which is -5." 
*   Even if they remember the rule "two negatives make a positive," they may still intuitively sum the absolute values to get **+5 (Option C)** instead of multiplying them to get **+4 (Option A)**.

This is a **notational trap**: the parentheses and the overarching goal of "expanding" are meant to signal multiplication, but because the arrows point to two isolated terms that *look* like an arithmetic sum ($-1 - 4$), students revert to lower-level additive arithmetic, ignoring the operation required by the algebraic context.
