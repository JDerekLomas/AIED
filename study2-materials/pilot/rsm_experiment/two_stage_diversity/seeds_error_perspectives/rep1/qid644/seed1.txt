One specific reason students find this question difficult is the **conflicting cognitive rules regarding negative signs during the multiplication of constants.**

Specifically, many students struggle with the **transition from "identifying" signs to "operating" on them.** 

When students look at the terms indicated ($-1$ and $-4$), their brains are simultaneously processing two different mathematical operations:

1.  **Additive Processing:** In their head, they may perform $-1 - 4$. Because they see two negative signs, they instinctively "combine" the absolute values, leading them to an answer of $-5$ (Option D). 
2.  **Multiplicative Processing:** Even if they remember that the operation is multiplication, the common mnemonic "two negatives make a plus" is often misapplied. A student might correctly determine the sign is positive but then mentally perform addition on the integers ($1 + 4 = 5$), leading them to $+5$ (Option C).

The visual layout of the brackets often reinforces this "Addition Error." Because the numbers are small and the arrows physically point to the last elements of the expressions, students frequently default to "totaling" the end of the brackets rather than applying the multiplicative FOIL/Grid method. The difficulty lies in **suppressing the urge to add** when presented with a string of two signed integers.
