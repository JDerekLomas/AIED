One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conflict between the order of operations ($BIDMAS/PEMDAS$) and the left-to-right reading direction**, specifically concerning the exponent.

In the equation $y = 3x^2$, students frequently succumb to the **"linear processing error"** where they multiply $3$ by $0.3$ first, and then square the result. 

### The specific cognitive trap:
Because we read from left to right, a student’s internal dialogue often follows the literal order of the characters: 
1. "3 times $x$..." 
2. "...squared."

This leads them to calculate $(3 \times 0.3)^2$, which results in $0.9^2 = \mathbf{0.81}$ **(Distractor A)**. 

Mathematically, this is a failure to recognize that the exponent binds more tightly to the base ($x$) than the coefficient ($3$). In a research setting, this is often categorized as a "structural error," where the student perceives the expression $3x^2$ as a single unit to be multiplied, rather than recognizing $x^2$ as a priority operation. This error is exacerbated here because the result of the incorrect method ($0.81$) "looks" like a plausible mathematical square (resembling $9^2 = 81$), giving the student a false sense of confidence in their path.
