As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify a specific difficulty in this problem rooted in the **decimal-place misconception regarding the squaring of numbers between 0 and 1.**

The most significant point of failure for students is the calculation of **$(0.3)^2$**.

### The Specific Difficulty: "Squaring keeps the same number of decimal places"
Many students apply an intuitive but incorrect rule that the product of two numbers should have the same number of decimal places as the factors, or that "squaring doesn't change the decimal magnitude."

1.  **The Error Step:** When calculating $(0.3)^2$, a student frequently reasons that $3 \times 3 = 9$, and because the input has one decimal place, the output should also have one decimal place. This leads them to conclude that $0.3^2 = 0.9$.
2.  **The Follow-through:** The student then multiplies this result by the coefficient: $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$.
3.  **The Trap:** Because **2.7 (Option D)** is explicitly provided as a distractor, it reinforces the student's incorrect decimal placement.

### Why this is a "Notational Trap"
This error is exacerbated by the lack of "visual check" mechanisms in squaring decimals. While students intuitively know that squaring a whole number makes it much larger, they often lack the "place value number sense" to realize that squaring a decimal smaller than 1 results in a significantly smaller value ($0.09$ is less than one-third the size of $0.3$). 

Students who arrive at **$0.27$ (the correct answer, B)** must successfully navigate two distinct potential pitfalls:
*   Realizing that $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$ (two decimal places).
*   Correcting the impulse to select $0.81$ (Option A), which occurs if a student squares the *entire* term $(3x)^2$ rather than applying the order of operations (BIDMAS/PEMDAS) to calculate $3(x^2)$.
