As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle in this problem as **the "Squaring Decimals" Place Value Trap.**

Students are highly likely to select **Option D (2.7)** due to a specific error in their mental or written calculation of $0.3^2$.

### The Specific Difficulty: Decimal Place Misconception
When calculating $y = 3(0.3)^2$, students often correctly identify the order of operations (square first, then multiply by 3) but falter on the magnitude of the square. 

The error proceeds as follows:
1.  **Linear Thinking applied to Squares:** Many students apply the logic of multiplication or addition to squaring. They think: "$3 \times 3 = 9$, so $0.3 \times 0.3$ must be $0.9$." They fail to realize that squaring a number between 0 and 1 results in a smaller value ($0.09$) because they are taking a fraction of a fraction (three-tenths of three-tenths).
2.  **Confirmation Bias in the Distractors:** Once a student concludes that $0.3^2 = 0.9$, they perform the second step: $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$. Because $2.7$ is present as **Option D**, the student feels a false sense of security that their process was correct.

### Why this is more difficult than integer versions:
If the question asked for $x = 3$, the student would calculate $3 \times 3^2 = 27$. In that case, the decimal placement is not a factor. However, with $x = 0.3$, the student must navigate the counter-intuitive fact that $0.3^2$ has *two* decimal places ($0.09$), while the input had only one. 

Students who struggle with the "Power of a Product" rule or who rely on "counting decimal points" often forget to shift the decimal twice, leading them directly to the "plausible but wrong" answer of 2.7 instead of the correct **0.27 (Option B)**.
