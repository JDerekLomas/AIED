One specific reason students find this question difficult is the **conflict between the order of operations ($BIDMAS/PEMDAS$) and the left-to-right reading habit**, specifically regarding the exponent.

In the expression $3x^2$, a common misconception is for students to multiply $3 \times 0.3$ first, and then square the result.

### The Specific Error: 
Students often perform the calculation as $(3 \times 0.3)^2$ instead of $3 \times (0.3)^2$.

1.  **The Misstep:** They calculate $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$.
2.  **The Resulting Error:** They then square $0.9$ ($0.9 \times 0.9$) to get **$0.81$ (Distractor A)**.

### Why this happens here:
*   **Visual Proximity:** The coefficient $3$ and the variable $x$ are written adjacently, which suggests a "package" to some students. Without parentheses explicitly separating the $3$ from the $x$, students intuitively group them before applying the exponent.
*   **Decimal Squaring Trap:** Students who do know to square $0.3$ first often struggle with place value. They may think $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, which leads them to calculate $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ (Distractor D). However, the specific error leading to $0.81$ is a diagnostic indicator that the student has fundamentally prioritized the **multiplication over the exponentiation**.
