One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **visual/notational trap** related to the standard convention of **Linear Function representation**.

In introductory algebra, students are overwhelmingly trained to work with the **Explicit Form** ($y = mx + c$), where the $y$ variable is isolated. In this specific question, the equation is presented in **Standard Form** ($4x + 2y = 10$). 

Because the $y$ term has a coefficient of 2 rather than being isolated, many students will default to a "Position-Based Calculation" error. Instead of treating the equation as a balance to be solved, they may look only at the constants and the coefficient of $x$. Specifically:

1.  The student identifies $x = 0$.
2.  They correctly see that $4(0)$ vanishes.
3.  However, because they are conditioned to see the "number at the end" of a function as the $y$-intercept, they may mistakenly assume $y = 10$ (the constant) or perform a single-step operation like $10 - 4$ or $10 \div 4$.

If a student fails to notice the **coefficient of 2** attached to the $y$, they will likely choose a "lure" answer or become stuck because the $y$-intercept is not explicitly isolated as it would be in the form $y = -2x + 5$. This requirement to perform a **two-step inverse operation** ($10 \div 2$) even when $x=0$ is a frequent stumbling block for students used to the $y = mx + b$ format.
