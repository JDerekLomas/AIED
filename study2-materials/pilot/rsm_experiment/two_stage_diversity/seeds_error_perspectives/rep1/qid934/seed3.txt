One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **visual/notational trap** related to the conventional horizontal layout of tables of values and the tendency toward "linear scanning."

**The Trap: Pattern-Seeking vs. Algebraic Substitution**
In many introductory algebra problems, a table presents the $x$ values in the top row and $y$ values in the bottom row. When a student sees the $x$ values progressing as $0, 1, 2, 3, 4$, their brain often treats the problem as a sequence-filling task rather than an equation-solving task.

**How the error occurs:**
Students may correctly solve for the first value ($\star = 5$ when $x=0$) but then incorrectly fill the rest of the empty boxes by adding the coefficient of $x$ (4) to the $y$ value. They observe the $x$ row increasing by 1 and assume the $y$ row should "increase" by the most prominent number in the equation. Because the equation is in **Standard Form ($Ax + By = C$)** rather than **Slope-Intercept Form ($y = mx + b$)**, students frequently mistake the coefficient of $x$ (which is 4) for the slope of the $y$ values.

**Why this makes Option A (20) a powerful distractor:**
If a student sees $4x + 2y = 10$ and doesn't understand the balance of the equation, they might simply multiply the first $x$ and $y$ coefficient ($4 \times 5 = 20$) or incorrectly apply the $10$ to the $2$ (10 multiplied by the coefficient of $y$). 

Alternatively, if they identify the $\star$ is under $x=0$, they might mistakenly think they are solving for the **x-intercept** instead of the **y-intercept**, or simply fail to perform the division step ($2y=10 \rightarrow y=5$), stopping at the "10" they see in the equation and dividing by the wrong variable's coefficient.
