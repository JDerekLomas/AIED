One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **visual/positional trap regarding the "invisible" zero**.

Students often learn the shortcut that to find a "starting value" or a $y$-intercept, they can simply "cover up" the term containing $x$. However, in this specific equation, $4x + 2y = 10$, a common error is for the student to mentally ignore the $4x$ (since $x=0$) but then **conflate the coefficient 2 with the $y$-value itself**.

Mathematically, they skip the division step because the number 10 is a multiple of both coefficients (4 and 2). A student may perform the mental "cover-up" and see:
$$2y = 10$$
Instead of dividing 10 by 2 to get **5 (Option C)**, the brain often defaults to a subtraction or "remainder" logic—looking at the relationship between the 2 and the 10—and incorrectly selects **B) 3** (perhaps thinking $y$ must "complete" the equation where $4(1) + 2(3) = 10$) or misidentifying the relationship entirely because they see the 4 and 10 and try to find a number that "fits" a pattern (10, 8, 6, 4...).

Specifically, the **presence of Option B (3)** is a "distractor of proximity"; students who plug in $x=1$ (the next cell in the table) will get $y=3$. A student who fails to look specifically at the $x=0$ column and instead looks at the overall "feel" of the table may solve for the easiest integer transition ($x=1, y=3$) and assume that value belongs in the first box.
