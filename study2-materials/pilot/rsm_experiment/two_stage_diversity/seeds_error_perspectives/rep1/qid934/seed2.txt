As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify a specific difficulty in the **algebraic structure of the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\)**, particularly the need for **multi-step inverse operations** when the coefficient of the unknown (\(y\)) is not \(1\).

### The Specific Difficulty: The "Substitution vs. Evaluation" Trap
Students often find this question difficult because it requires **solving an equation** after substitution, rather than simply **evaluating an expression**.

When a student substitutes \(x = 0\) into the equation, they arrive at:
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]

The most frequent error occurs at this specific junction. In simpler "table of values" problems (e.g., \(y = 4x + 5\)), the student only needs to perform arithmetic on one side to find \(y\). Here, however, the student must perform an additional algebraic step—dividing by the coefficient \(2\).

**Why this leads to errors:**
*   **Additive Interference:** A student may see \(2y = 10\) and intuitively think of the relationship between 2 and 10 as additive/subtractive, leading them to subtract 2 from 10 and look for \(8\).
*   **Coefficient Neglect:** Many students possess a "partial processing" habit where they focus on the constant. Upon seeing \(x=0\) (which "cancels" the \(4x\)), they look at the remaining numbers \(2, y,\) and \(10\). A student who identifies Option C (5) has correctly navigated the division, but a student who sees the "10" and misses the "2" might be tempted by an answer that matches the constant (though 10 is not an option here, this mental load increases the chance of a random guess).
*   **The "Half-way" Error (Option D):** A student might correctly divide once, but if they confuse which variable they are solving for, they might try to divide the 10 by the 4 (from the \(x\) term), leading to \(2.5\).

**In summary:** The difficulty lies in the transition from **arithmetic substitution** (calculating \(4 \times 0\)) to **algebraic isolation** (solving \(2y = 10\)). Many students expect $y$ to be the "output" of a calculation rather than a component of an equilibrium.
