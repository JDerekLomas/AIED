One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual trap of the digit "0" and its impact on the denominator**.

Specifically, many students struggle with the concept of whether a value of zero counts as a "data point." This often leads to a two-step error reflected in **Option C**:

1.  **Additive Masking:** Because $0$ does not change the sum of the numbers $(1+3+4+7=15)$, students mentally "discard" it as being mathematically irrelevant to the numerator. 
2.  **Cardinality Error:** Once the $0$ is discarded from the sum, students often intuitively discard it from the count (the $n$ value). They see four "active" digits and therefore believe they must divide by 4.

The difficulty lies in the abstraction that the *position* (the frequency) of the value must be counted even when the *magnitude* of the value adds nothing to the total. A student who correctly identifies that Option A has the correct denominator (5) may still be tempted to choose Option C because they see the "0" is missing from the numerator of Option A, failing to realize that adding 0 is mathematically identical to omitting it, whereas changing the denominator from 5 to 4 is not.
