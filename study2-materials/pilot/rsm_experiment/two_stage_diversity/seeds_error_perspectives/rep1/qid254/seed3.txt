One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **status of zero as a placeholder in the divisor**, leading many to choose Option C.

### The Misconception: "Zero Doesn't Count"
Many students operate under a primitive "counting" intuition where only non-zero integers are seen as "data points." Because adding zero does not change the sum of the numerators (\(0+1+3+4+7\) is the same as \(1+3+4+7\)), students often incorrectly conclude that zero should also be excluded from the count of items ($n$).

**How this plays out in the question:**
*   A student looks at the set and sees four "active" numbers $(1, 3, 4, 7)$.
*   They recognize that the numerator for the mean of $\{0, 1, 3, 4, 7\}$ is functionally equivalent to the numerator for $\{1, 3, 4, 7\}$.
*   They fail to recognize the mean as a measure of "distribution per trial" or "per day," instead seeing it purely as an additive operation.
*   Consequently, they select **Option C**, treating the set as having only four members. 

This specific difficulty reveals a lack of conceptual understanding regarding **$n$ as the number of observations**, rather than the count of non-zero values. In this particular question, the presence of zero acts as a "distractor of magnitude," tempting students to align the divisor with the number of non-zero digits they see.
