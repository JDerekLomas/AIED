A specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the presence of the number **zero** in the dataset, which leads to a common conceptual error regarding the **divisor (n)** in the mean formula.

**The "Null Value" Trap:**
Students frequently conflate "value" with "existence." Because zero represents a quantity of nothing, many students intuitively feel it does not "count" as a data point. This leads to two specific errors addressed in the distractors:

1.  **Selection of Option C:** A student may correctly sum the numbers to 15 but, seeing only four non-zero digits, divide by 4. They treat the zero as if it were a missing value rather than a measured observation.
2.  **Selection of Option A:** This is the most "subtle" trap in this specific question. A student might recognize that they must divide by 5 (acknowledging the zero's existence as a data point), but when writing out the numerator, they omit the "0+" because it doesn't change the sum. While mathematically $(\frac{1+3+4+7}{5})$ yields the correct numerical result, a student focused on the *process* of the mean—summing **all** values—may hesitate or overthink whether the expression is "complete" without the zero explicitly represented in the addition.

In this context, the difficulty lies in the transition from **arithmetic** (where adding zero is redundant) to **statistics** (where the zero is an essential anchor for the denominator).
