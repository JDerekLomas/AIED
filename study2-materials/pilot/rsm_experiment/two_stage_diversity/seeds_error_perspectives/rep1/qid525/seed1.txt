As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify the most significant difficulty in this question as the **"add across" error facilitated by the specific distractors**, which stems from a conceptual misunderstanding of fractions as two independent whole numbers.

**The Specific Trap: Distractor D (\(4 \frac{8}{14}\))**

Students who struggle with the conceptual nature of a common denominator often treat the numerator and denominator as distinct integers. This leads to a systematic error where they add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), then add the numerators ($7+1=8$), and finally add the denominators ($10+4=14$).

This feature makes the question difficult because:
1.  **Intuitive Interference:** The "add across" strategy mirrors the procedure for fraction multiplication, leading to "over-generalization" of rules.
2.  **Reinforcement by Option D:** When a student performs this incorrect operation and sees their exact result (\(4 \frac{8}{14}\)) listed as an option, it provides immediate **false validation**. This stops the student from self-correcting or questioning their logic, as they believe the presence of the answer in the list confirms the accuracy of their method.
3.  **Numerical Complexity:** The leap from the "add across" method to the correct method (finding a least common multiple of 20) requires multiple steps—finding the LCM, equivalent fraction conversion, and carrying over a whole number if the result is improper. Students often opt for the "path of least resistance" provided by Distractor D.

In summary, the inclusion of **Option D** acts as a powerful "attractor" for students with weak proportional reasoning, trapping them in a common procedural misconception.
