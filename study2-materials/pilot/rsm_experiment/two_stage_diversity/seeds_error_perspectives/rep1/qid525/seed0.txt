As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **common error of "Add-Across" denominator logic** as a primary reason students struggle with this question, specifically manifesting in **Option D**.

**The Specific Obstacle: The Natural Number Transfer Error**
Students often attempt to apply the intuitive logic of whole-number addition (adding components left-to-right) to the components of a fraction. In this specific problem, a student is likely to:
1.  Correctly add the whole numbers ($2 + 2 = 4$).
2.  Incorrectly add the numerators ($7 + 1 = 8$).
3.  Incorrectly add the denominators ($10 + 4 = 14$).

This leads them directly to **Option D ($4 \frac{8}{14}$)**.

**Why this feature makes the error more likely:**
The structure of the denominators (10 and 4) creates a "decoy of simplicity." Unlike problems where denominators have a clear, small Lowest Common Multiple (like 2 and 4), 10 and 4 require a multi-step conversion to 20 or 40. For a student experiencing "cognitive load" from the mixed numbers, the shortcut of adding $10 + 4$ is computationally less demanding than finding a common denominator. 

Option D acts as a **"recognition trap"**: because the digits 8 and 14 are the literal sums of the digits in the question, the student receives immediate (but false) visual confirmation that their process was correct, leading them to bypass the necessary step of finding a common denominator.
