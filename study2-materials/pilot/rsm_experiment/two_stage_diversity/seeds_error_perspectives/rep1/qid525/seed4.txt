As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **common error of "independent whole number and numerator addition"** as the specific reason students might select distractor **D ($4 \frac{8}{14}$)**.

### The Specific Difficulty: The "Add Everything" Heuristic
A significant number of students perceive a mixed number not as a single value ($2 + \frac{7}{10}$), but as a collection of four independent integers. When faced with this problem, they apply a naive additive shortcut:
1.  **Add the whole numbers:** $2 + 2 = 4$.
2.  **Add the numerators:** $7 + 1 = 8$.
3.  **Add the denominators:** $10 + 4 = 14$.

### Why this specific question triggers it:
This error is particularly common here because of the **"Whole Number trap."** Unlike a problem where the fractions have common denominators (like $\frac{1}{10} + \frac{3}{10}$), the presence of different denominators ($10$ and $4$) creates cognitive load. To avoid the complex process of finding a Lowest Common Multiple (20), students revert to a lower-level intuitive strategy—treating the fraction components like a "score" (e.g., getting 7 out of 10 and 1 out of 4).

**Distractor D** is specifically designed to validate this incorrect logic. A student who arrives at $4 \frac{8}{14}$ and sees it as an option feels a false sense of "procedural fluency," even though they have fundamentally ignored the necessity of equal parts (the common denominator). This demonstrates a lack of **proportional reasoning**, where the student treats the denominator as a count rather than a size of a unit.
