One specific reason students might find this question difficult is the **“Add-Across Error,”** where they incorrectly treat the numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers.

**The specific step:** 
In the addition \( \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} \), a student may simply add the numerators (\(7+1=8\)) and the denominators (\(10+4=14\)) to get \( \frac{8}{14} \). When combined with the sum of the whole numbers (\(2+2=4\)), they arrive at **Distractor D (\(4 \frac{8}{14}\))**.

**Why this is a persistent trap in this question:**
1.  **Low Common Multiple (LCM) Cognitive Load:** To solve the problem correctly, students must identify that 10 and 4 share a common factor (2) and determine the LCM is 20. If a student struggles with finding a least common denominator, the intuitive "path of least resistance" is to simply add the digits they see.
2.  **Reinforced Logic:** Students are taught that for the *whole number* part of the expression, they can simply add $2 + 2 = 4$. This reinforces the misconception that they can apply that same "linear" addition to the fractional components.
3.  **Plausibility of the Distractor:** Because \(4 \frac{8}{14}\) contains numbers directly visible in the prompt (2, 2, 7, 1, 10, 4), it feels "correct" to a student lacking procedural fluency with fractions, as it preserves the original integers rather than transforming them into equivalent fractions like \(\frac{14}{20}\) and \(\frac{5}{20}\).
