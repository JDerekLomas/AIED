One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **“Add Everything” Trap**, specifically regarding the denominators, which leads them directly to **Distractor D**.

In fractional addition, a common developmental error—often referred to as "freshman's sum" logic—is for students to simply add across the numerators and add across the denominators separately. In this specific problem:

1.  Students add the whole numbers: $2 + 2 = 4$.
2.  Students add the numerators: $7 + 1 = 8$.
3.  Students add the denominators: $10 + 4 = 14$.

This yields the answer **$4 \frac{8}{14}$**. 

The difficulty lies in the fact that this error stems from a misplaced application of the algorithm for *multiplication* (where you do operate straight across) or from treating the numerator and denominator as independent whole numbers rather than a single ratio. This mistake is made more likely here because the resulting fraction ($\frac{8}{14}$) is a proper fraction that looks "plausible," unlike instances where such an error might produce an obviously incorrect result. If a student is rushing or lacks a conceptual understanding of common denominators, the presence of Option D acts as a powerful "confirmation" of their incorrect process.
