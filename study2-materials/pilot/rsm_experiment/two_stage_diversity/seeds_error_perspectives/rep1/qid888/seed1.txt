One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conflict between "Double Negatives" across two different operations**: multiplication and addition.

Specifically, many students struggle with the transition between the fourth term of FOIL ($(-5) \times (-7)$) and the combining of like terms ($(-5m) + (-7m)$).

**The "Signs are Always Positive" Trap:**
Students frequently apply the "two negatives make a positive" rule indiscriminately. While this leads them correctly to $+35$ for the constant term (eliminating options A and D), they often misapply the same logic to the linear terms. A common error is thinking:
*"I have a $-5$ and a $-7$; since they are both negative, the result must be positive $12$."*

This leads them to choose **Option C ($m^2 + 12m + 35$)**. 

**The Visual/Notational Conflict:**
The difficulty lies in the mental "mode switching" required in a single problem:
1.  **Multiplication mode:** $-5 \times -7 = +35$ (The signs "cancel out").
2.  **Addition mode:** $-5m - 7m = -12m$ (The negative "debt" increases).

Because the multiplication step is often performed or checked last in the FOIL sequence, the "negative times negative is positive" rule is the last piece of mathematical logic fresh in the student's working memory. This often "bleeds over" into the middle term, causing them to override the correct sum of $-12$ with a positive $12$.
