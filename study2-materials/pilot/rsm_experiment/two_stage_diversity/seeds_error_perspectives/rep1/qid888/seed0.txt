As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **application of integer sign rules to the constant term** as the specific point of difficulty—specifically the transition from $(-5) \times (-7)$ to $+35$.

While many students successfully identify the middle term as $-12m$ (by adding $-5$ and $-7$), they often struggle with the "double negative" multiplication required for the final term. This leads to a specific cognitive trap:

### The "Same Sign" Confusion
Students often internalize a heuristic that "a negative and a negative make a positive," but they frequently misapply it or forget to apply it when under the pressure of the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) method.

*   **The Error:** A student correctly calculates the middle term as $-12m$ because they are "combining" two negatives. When they move to the last step ($ -5 \times -7 $), their brain remains in "addition/combination mode." They perceive the two minus signs in the brackets and, instead of switching to multiplication sign rules, they maintain the negative polarity, leading them to choose **Option D** ($m^2 - 12m - 35$).
*   **The Distractor Trap:** This question is designed to exploit the interference between **additive logic** ($-5 + -7 = -12$) and **multiplicative logic** ($-5 \times -7 = +35$). A student who identifies the correct $-12m$ middle term may feel a sense of completion and "coast" through the last multiplication, selecting a negative product because "the whole problem is full of minus signs."

This specific difficulty is evidenced by the high selection rate of **Option D** in classroom settings, where students demonstrate mastery of the process (FOIL) and the linear term but fail the arithmetic sign transformation for the constant.
