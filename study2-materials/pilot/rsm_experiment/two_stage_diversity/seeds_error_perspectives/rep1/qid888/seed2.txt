As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **application of integer multiplication signs to the constant term** as the primary pivot point of difficulty for this question.

Specifically, students frequently struggle with the "double negative" in the final step of the FOIL (First, Outside, Inside, Last) method. When multiplying the "Last" terms, $( -5 ) \times ( -7 )$, many students correctly identify the numerical product as $35$ but reflexively apply the subtraction signs from the binomials to the result, leading them to conclude the term must be $-35$.

**Why this specific error occurs here:**
In the context of expansion, students often treat the operation as a process of "carrying down" signs rather than performing signed multiplication. Options **A** and **D** function as "attractors" for this specific cognitive trap. 
*   A student who identifies the middle term correctly as $-12m$ (from $-5m - 7m$) but fails the sign rule for the product will be drawn to **Option D**.
*   This error is exacerbated by a "misgeneralized shortcut": some students simply look at the symbols in $(m-x)(m-y)$ and assume that because the inputs contain minus signs, the output should "look" like it contains minus signs, leading them to reject the mathematically correct positive constant in **Option B**.
