As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **"Double Negative Constant"** multiplication as the specific feature most likely to cause a distribution of errors across the distractors.

### The Specific Difficulty: Integer Multiplication Rules vs. Addition Rules
The most critical point of failure in this problem is the constant term resulting from multiplying $(-5)$ by $(-7)$.

Students frequently suffer from **"Cognitive Load Interference"** when processing two negatives in different ways within the same FOIL/distribution process:

1.  **The Addition/Linear Step:** To find the middle term, students add $(-5) + (-7)$ to get $-12$. Here, the "rule" they internalize is that two negatives staying negative (moving further left on a number line).
2.  **The Multiplication/Constant Step:** To find the final term, they must multiply $(-5) \times (-7)$.

**Why this leads to specific errors:**
Students often experience a "rule overflow" where they misapply the logic of the addition step to the multiplication step. Because they have just successfully combined $-5$ and $-7$ to reach a *negative* $12$, their brain maintains that "negative momentum," leading them to choose **Distractor D ($m^2 - 12m - 35$)**. They correctly perform the arithmetic ($5 \times 7 = 35$) but fail the sign change because they are subconsciously staying consistent with the negative sign used for the linear coefficient.

Conversely, a student who over-corrects and remembers that "two negatives make a plus" might over-apply that rule to the addition phase, leading them to **Distractor C ($m^2 + 12m + 35$)**.

### Conclusion
The question is difficult not because of the algebra, but because it forces the student to **toggle between two different sign rules** for the same pair of digits in a single operation. The high frequency of Distractor D in empirical testing usually confirms that the "negative momentum" from the middle term often overrides the multiplication rule for the constant.
