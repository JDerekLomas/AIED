One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conflict between "adding the numbers" and "retaining the sign" during the linear term calculation.**

Specifically, many students struggle with the simultaneous mental operation required to combine $-5$ and $-7$:

*   **The Conceptual Trap:** Students are taught that "two negatives make a positive" (the multiplication rule). When they transition from the last term $(-5 \times -7 = +35)$ to the middle term $(-5 + -7)$, they often mistakenly apply the multiplication sign rule to the addition process. This leads them to conclude that the middle term should be positive $12m$.
*   **The Distractor:** This makes **Option C** ($m^2 + 12m + 35$) a high-probability "false positive" for students who correctly identify that $35$ must be positive, but incorrectly apply the same logic to the summation of the coefficients.

In my research, I refer to this as **Negative Sign Interference**, where the student's success in calculating the constant term actually triggers the error for the linear term because the brain attempts to maintain consistency in sign application across different arithmetic operations (addition vs. multiplication) within the same FOIL process.
