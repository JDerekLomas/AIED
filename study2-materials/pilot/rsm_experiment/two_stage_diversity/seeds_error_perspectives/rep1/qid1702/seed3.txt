One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **visual/notational trap** related to the vertical orientation of the table of values.

In early algebra education, students are overwhelmingly accustomed to seeing tables where $x$ is the top (or left) row and is given as an integer "input" to be plugged in to find $y$. In this specific problem, however, the provided value ($0.5$) is for $y$, requiring the student to work backward to find $x$.

This layout frequently triggers a **"directionality error"**:

1.  **The Error:** Students see the value $0.5$ and the blank space above it. Out of habit, they treat $0.5$ as $x$ and substitute it into the $x$ position of the equation: $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$.
2.  **The Miscalculation:** This leads to $5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y = -4.16...$
3.  **The Trap:** When students do not see their answer among the choices, they may "force" a fit to Option B ($-4.25$) due to its visual similarity, assuming they made a small arithmetic mistake rather than a conceptual one.

Students who find this easy are usually those who have moved past "formulaic" substitution (inputting $x$ to get $y$) and instead view the equation as a balance of two variables where the "missing" value can be either letter regardless of its position in a table.
