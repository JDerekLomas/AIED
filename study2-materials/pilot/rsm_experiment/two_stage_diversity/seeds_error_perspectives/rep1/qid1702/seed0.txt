A significant reason students may find this question difficult is a **notational trap involving the placement of the $y$-value ($0.5$) relative to the equation.**

Specifically, students are prone to a **Variable Swap Error**, where they substitute $0.5$ for $x$ rather than $y$.

**Why this specific error occurs here:**
In standard algebra pedagogy, students are most frequently practiced in solving for $y$ given $x$ (evaluating a function). Because the variable $x$ appears first in the equation $10x - 6y = 30$ and is usually the "input" variable in a table, the student’s mental script is primed to "plug in the number provided."

If a student performs this swap, the calculation becomes:
$$10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \implies 5 - 6y = 30 \implies -6y = 25 \implies y \approx -4.16$$
While $-4.16$ is not an exact match for Option B ($-4.25$), the proximity of the digits can lead a struggling student to "round" or assume they made a minor arithmetic slip and select B anyway, falsely confirming their incorrect process.

**The correct step where students falter:**
The difficulty lies in the **reverse operations** required after the correct substitution ($10x - 6(0.5) = 30$). Instead of a simple "multiply and subtract" sequence (if they were solving for $y$), they must substitute for $y$ and perform a multi-step algebraic isolation of $x$:
1. Correct substitution: $10x - 3 = 30$
2. Addition: $10x = 33$
3. Division: $x = 3.3$ (Option C)

Students who lack "operational flexibility"—the ability to work backwards through an equation rather than just following a left-to-right evaluation—will find this table entry significantly harder than one where $x$ is provided.
