One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **visual/notational trap** regarding the vertical orientation of the table.

In lower-secondary mathematics, students are predominantly exposed to horizontal tables of values where $x$ is the top row and $y$ is the bottom row. However, they are also frequently taught the procedure of "calculating the output $(y)$ given the input $(x)$." 

In this specific question, the table is vertical, and the provided value (0.5) is for **$y$**, while the target unknown ($\bigstar$) is for **$x$**. A common error for students under time pressure or with weak reading comprehension is to instinctively treat the known number as the input ($x$). 

**The specific failure point:**
Instead of solving $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, a student may substitute $0.5$ for $x$:
1. $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$
2. $5 - 6y = 30$
3. $-6y = 25$
4. $y \approx -4.16$ (leading them to choose **B** as the closest visual match).

Because the question asks to solve for the "top" variable, it reverses the standard directional workflow (left-to-right or input-to-output) that many students follow robotically. If they do not consciously pause to map the variable $y$ to its specific numerical value, they fall into the trap of **procedural reversal error.**
