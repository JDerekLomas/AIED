One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "Left-to-Right" Bias** overriding the order of operations, specifically leading them to perform the subtraction before the addition.

In this expression ($3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$), after a student correctly performs the multiplication ($4 \times 2 = 8$), they are left with $3 - 5 + 8$. A common pedagogical misunderstanding is that in the acronym **PEMDAS/BODMAS**, the "A" (Addition) comes before the "S" (Subtraction).

This leads to a specific error:
1.  Students see $+ 8$ and naturally want to combine the positive integers first or follow the acronym strictly: $5 + 8 = 13$.
2.  They then bring down the leading 3 and the minus sign: $3 - 13$.
3.  This results in **$-10$ (Option D)**.

The difficulty lies in the fact that addition and subtraction hold equal priority and must be processed strictly from left to right. The notation $3 - 5 + 8$ traps students who perceive the minus sign as an operator belonging solely to the 5, rather than viewing the expression as a sum of directed numbers: $(+3) + (-5) + (+8)$. Students who prioritize the "A" in the acronym will erroneously group the $5+8$ while ignoring the negative sign attached to the 5.
