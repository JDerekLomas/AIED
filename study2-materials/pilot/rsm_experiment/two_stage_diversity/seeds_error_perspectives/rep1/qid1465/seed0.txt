One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual layout and perceived separation** between the terms $3 - 5$ and the term $4 \times 2$, which often leads to the **"Left-to-Right Addition" error.**

### The specific mechanism:
Students are taught the PEMDAS/BODMAS mnemonic, which lists Addition (A) before Subtraction (S). Many students interpret this literally as a strict hierarchy, believing addition must always precede subtraction regardless of their position. 

In this specific problem, students often perform the addition of the middle term and the result of the multiplication first:
1.  **Multiplication first:** $4 \times 2 = 8$
2.  **Rigid Hierarchy Error:** The student sees the $+$ sign and thinks they must resolve it before the $-$ sign. They add the $5$ and the $8$: $5 + 8 = 13$.
3.  **Final calculation:** $3 - 13 = -10$ (Option D).

### Why this happens here:
The difficulty is exacerbated because the number 5 is visually preceded by a minus sign. To solve it correctly, a student must treat the subtraction as adding a negative ($3 + (-5) + 8$) or strictly follow left-to-right processing for operations of equal priority. 

However, because $5 + (4 \times 2)$ results in a "clean" positive 13, it creates a "cognitive pull" to combine those numbers first, leading the student to treat the expression as $3 - (5 + 8)$ instead of $(3 - 5) + 8$. This makes **Option D** a highly effective distractor for those who over-apply the "A before S" rule.
