One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **“Addition before Subtraction” misconception**, rooted in a literal interpretation of the PEMDAS/BODMAS acronyms.

### The Notational Trap: The Order of Left-to-Right Operations
Because the letter **'A' (Addition)** precedes **'S' (Subtraction)** in mnemonic aids, many students believe they must perform all addition operations in an expression before any subtraction operations, regardless of their position.

**The Error Path:**
1.  A student correctly performs the multiplication first: $4 \times 2 = 8$. The expression becomes $3 - 5 + 8$.
2.  Instead of working from left to right, the student follows the literal acronym and performs addition next: $5 + 8 = 13$.
3.  This leaves the final calculation as $3 - 13$, leading to the **distractor D) $-10$**.

**Why this is a specific difficulty:**
This error is particularly "sticky" because it arises from a correctly memorized rule being applied with an incomplete understanding of its hierarchy (i.e., that Addition and Subtraction hold equal priority and must be processed left-to-right). The presence of $-10$ as an option validates the student's incorrect procedural path, making them less likely to re-evaluate their logic.
