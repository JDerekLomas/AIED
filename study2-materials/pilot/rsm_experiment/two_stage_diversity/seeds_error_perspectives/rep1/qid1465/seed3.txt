One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **spatial arrangement of the terms**, which often triggers an **"addition-before-subtraction" priority error** due to a misunderstanding of the "A" and "S" in PEMDAS/BODMAS.

### The Visual/Procedural Trap: Left-to-Right Neglect
Many students memorize the acronym (Order of Operations) as a strict linear sequence rather than a grouping of operations. In this specific expression ($3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$), once the multiplication is completed ($3 - 5 + 8$), the student is left with an addition and a subtraction operator.

A student who rigidly follows the acronym will often prioritize **Addition before Subtraction**, regardless of their position in the string. They mentally "see" the $5+8$ as a discrete unit because the addition sign sits between them, leading to this common incorrect path:

1.  Multiply: $4 \times 2 = 8 \rightarrow (3 - 5 + 8)$
2.  Add (the error): $5 + 8 = 13 \rightarrow (3 - 13)$
3.  Subtract: $3 - 13 = \mathbf{-10}$ (Option D)

### Why this happens:
The "addition-first" error is more likely here because the subtraction sign precedes the 5. If the question were $3 + 8 - 5$, the student would likely get the correct answer (6) by sheer accident of reading left-to-right. However, by placing the subtraction at the start of the sequence ($3 - 5 + 8$), the question specifically tests whether a student understands that **addition and subtraction have equal priority** and must be performed from left to right. Those who view the "plus" sign as a signal to combine the two numbers to its left and right before addressing the "minus" sign will consistently fall for the trap of Option D.
