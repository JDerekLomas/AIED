One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "Left-to-Right" trap**, specifically regarding the priority of the subtraction operator over the multiplication operator.

Educational research, such as that by Landy and Goldstone, suggests that students often perceive physical spacing and the linear flow of reading as a cue for mathematical precedence, overriding formal Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) rules.

In this specific problem, a student is likely to process the operations in the order they encounter them visually:
1.  **Step 1:** $3 - 5 = -2$
2.  **Step 2:** $-2 + 4 = 2$
3.  **Step 3:** $2 \times 2 = 4$ (leading to incorrect **Option B**)

This error occurs because the multiplication ($4 \times 2$) is positioned at the far right of the string. Research into "mental spacing" shows that if the addition and subtraction signs are encountered first, students often treat the expression as a chain of sequential instructions. The difficulty lies in the cognitive demand required to "skip" the first two operations to perform the multiplication at the end, then jump back to the start to incorporate the remaining terms. Students who rely on a purely sequential processing strategy will be "trapped" into choosing 4 instead of the correct 6.
