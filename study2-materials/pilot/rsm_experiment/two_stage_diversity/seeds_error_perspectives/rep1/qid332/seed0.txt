One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **misapplication of the "distributive property" when multiplying to clear a fraction**, specifically in Katie’s approach.

**The Notational Trap:**
Students frequently struggle with the requirement to multiply **every term** in an equation by the denominator. When Katie proposes \(x - 5 = 36\), she has correctly multiplied the fraction (\(\frac{x}{3}\)) and the constant on the right-hand side (\(12\)) by \(3\), but she has failed to multiply the "floating" constant (\(-5\)) by \(3\).

**Why this specific error occurs here:**
*   **Visual Proximity:** The \(-5\) is physically separated from the fraction bar. Students often see the \(/3\) as belonging only to the \(x\), and thus mentally "shield" the \(-5\) from the multiplication operation.
*   **Shortcut Failure:** Many students use the "cancel the denominator" shortcut. They see the \(3\) disappear from under the \(x\) and move to the other side of the equals sign. Because the \(-5\) does not have a denominator, their mental model for this shortcut doesn't "trigger" a change for that term.

As a result, many students will conclude that Katie is correct because her equation *looks* like a logical simplification of the original, failing to realize she has technically multiplied the two sides by different values (or failed to distribute the \(3\) to the \(-5\)). This makes **Choice A (Only Tom)** a difficult selection for those who do not strictly adhere to the "balance" method of algebraic manipulation.
