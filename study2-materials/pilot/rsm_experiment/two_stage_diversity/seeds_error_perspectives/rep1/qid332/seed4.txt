One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual trap of proximity** associated with Katie’s method, which leads to a **failure to distribute the multiplication across all terms.**

Specifically, students often incorrectly identify Katie as "correct" because they see the denominator \(3\) directly underneath the \(x\) and perceive the operation as only belonging to that term. In their mental model, they move the \(3\) to the right-hand side (calculating \(12 \times 3 = 36\)) while leaving the \(-5\) untouched. 

This error is driven by the way the equation is typeset: 
*   Because the fraction bar is short and only under the \(x\), the \(-5\) appears "isolated" from the division. 
*   Students fail to realize that to eliminate the denominator \(3\) as a first step, the entire left-hand side must be multiplied by \(3\), which would require the \(-5\) to become \(-15\).

Therefore, a student who follows the common (but flawed) "shortcut" of simply "moving the bottom number to the other side" will incorrectly conclude that **C (Both)** is the answer, failing to notice that Katie’s line \(x-5=36\) violates the balance of the equation.
