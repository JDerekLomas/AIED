A primary reason students find this question difficult is a common **notational trap** regarding the **order of operations when applying a "balancing" action to an equation**.

Specifically, many students will incorrectly conclude that Katie is correct (choosing C) because they apply a shortcut involving the **distributive law** inconsistently.

### The Specific Difficulty: "Selective" Multiplication
When students see Katie’s line ($x - 5 = 36$), they identify that she has multiplied by $3$ to remove the denominator. A significant number of students believe that to "cancel out" a fraction, you only need to multiply the fraction term and the term on the other side of the equals sign.

*   **The Error:** Students often perceive the $-5$ as being "outside" the fraction's influence and therefore think it doesn't need to be multiplied. They fail to realize that if they choose to multiply by $3$ first (before adding $5$), the **entire left side** must be multiplied: $3(\frac{x}{3} - 5) = 12 \times 3$, which results in $x - 15 = 36$.
*   **The Trap:** Because the denominator line in $\frac{x}{3}$ does not extend under the $-5$, it provides a visual cue that the $3$ is only "linked" to the $x$. Students who rely on "moving" numbers rather than "performing the same operation to both sides" will likely miss that Katie failed to multiply the constant term.

**Summary:** This question is difficult because it pits a standard, intuitive step (Tom's addition) against a very common "malruled" shortcut (Katie's partial multiplication). Students who struggle with the conceptual requirement of **maintaining equality across all terms** will likely misidentify Katie’s line as a valid alternative path.
