One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **distributive trap of the fraction bar**, which often leads them to incorrectly select **C (Both Tom and Katie)**.

Students frequently struggle to determine whether a multiplication or division operation applies to the entire side of an equation or just a single term. This is often caused by a misunderstanding of the "operator priority" dictated by the length of the horizontal fraction bar.

### The Concrete Difficulty:
When evaluating Katie's statement (\(x - 5 = 36\)), a student might apply the common rule "To undo divide-by-3, you must multiply-by-3." If the student fails to recognize that the term \(-5\) is **outside** the fraction, they will multiply only the numerator ($x$) and the answer ($12$) by $3$, effectively ignoring the need to multiply the $-5$.

### Why this is a "Visual Trap":
*   **The Length of the Bar:** In the expression $\frac{x}{3} - 5$, the horizontal bar only sits under the $x$. However, students with poor spatial processing in algebra often treat the $-5$ as if it were "attached" to the numerator.
*   **Selective Application:** Students often believe they can "cancel" a denominator by simply moving it to the other side (e.g., $12 \times 3$), forgetting that multiplication is an operation that must be applied to the **entire expression** on the left-hand side ($\frac{x}{3} \times 3$ AND $-5 \times 3$).

Because Katie's result ($36$) is the "correct" product of $12$ and $3$, it provides a high level of **distractor plausibility**. A student who forgets to multiply the $-5$ will see Katie's line as mathematically sound, leading them to conclude that both students are correct, when in fact Katie’s next line should have been $x - 15 = 36$.
