A primary reason students find this question difficult is a **notational trap** regarding the **scope of the vinculum (fraction bar)** and how it interacts with the distributive property.

Specifically, many students will incorrectly identify **Katie** as being correct because they apply a "multiplication shortcut" without maintaining equivalent expressions.

### The Specific Difficulty: The "Premature Multiplication" Error
In the expression $\frac{x}{3}-5$, the denominator $3$ only applies to the $x$, not the constant $-5$. Students often struggle with the visual hierarchy of operations in horizontal algebraic layouts. 

*   **The Error:** Students frequently believe that to "get rid of the fraction," they can simply multiply the "main" parts of the equation by 3. Visually, they see $\frac{x}{3}$, $5$, and $12$ as three distinct blocks. They correctly multiply the fraction to get $x$ and the $12$ to get $36$, but they **fail to distribute the 3 to the term not over the fraction bar** (the $-5$).
*   **The Result:** This leads them to validate Katie’s line ($x - 5 = 36$). Because Katie’s line "looks" like a standard next step in clearing a denominator, students succumb to **conformation bias**—they recognize a familiar pattern (multiplying the RHS and the numerator) while ignoring the fractional coefficient's lack of reach over the constant term.

### Why this is a "trap":
If the question had been written as $\frac{x-5}{3} = 12$, Katie would be correct. Students who rely on visual patterns rather than formal properties (the Equality Property of Multiplication) fail to distinguish between $\frac{x}{3} - 5$ and $\frac{x-5}{3}$. Consequently, they are likely to choose **C (Both)**, failing to realize that Katie has essentially multiplied the first and third terms by 3 while leaving the middle term unchanged, violating the balance of the equation.
