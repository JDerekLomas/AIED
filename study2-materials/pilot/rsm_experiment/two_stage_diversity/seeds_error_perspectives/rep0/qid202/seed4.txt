One specific reason why students might find this question difficult relates to a **notational trap regarding the denominators during addition.**

Specifically, students commonly commit the "add across" error, where they treat the denominators as whole numbers to be summed (5 + 5 = 10) rather than a fixed unit of measure.

This error makes **Option D (\(3 \frac{3}{10}\))** a high-functioning distractor. While students may correctly add the whole numbers (\(2 + 1 = 3\)) and the numerators (\(1 + 2 = 3\)), they feel an intuitive "urge for symmetry" or a misapplied procedural rule that requires them to perform an operation on every number visible. In their minds, because they added the top numbers, they "must" add the bottom numbers to complete the step. This is a persistent cognitive hurdle in fraction arithmetic, as it mimics the rules for multiplication (\(\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}\)), leading to a procedural interference where the rules for one operation are incorrectly applied to another.
