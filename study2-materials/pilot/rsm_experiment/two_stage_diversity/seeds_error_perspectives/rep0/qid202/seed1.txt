One specific reason why students might find this question difficult relates to a **notational trap regarding the denominators during addition.**

Many students struggle with the intuition that a denominator represents the **size/name** of the part rather than a count of parts. Consequently, a common error is to treat the fraction as two separate whole-number addition problems (numerator + numerator and denominator + denominator). 

This leads students to select **Option D ($3 \frac{3}{10}$)**. They correctly add the whole numbers ($2+1=3$) and the numerators ($1+2=3$), but then erroneously add the denominators ($5+5=10$). 

This error is often "invisible" to students because:
1.  It follows the established logic of adding the other components (the whole numbers and the numerators).
2.  The resulting answer ($3 \frac{3}{10}$) looks "neat" and mathematically plausible to a student who lacks a visual concept of why the common denominator must remain constant to maintain the scale of the parts.
