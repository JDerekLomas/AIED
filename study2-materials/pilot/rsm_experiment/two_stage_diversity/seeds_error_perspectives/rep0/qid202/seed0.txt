One specific reason why students might find this question difficult relates to a **notational trap regarding the denominators during the addition process**, leading them to choose **Option D (\(3 \frac{3}{10}\))**.

### The Specific Difficulty: Denominator Summation
A common misconception in fractional arithmetic is the tendency to treat the numerator and denominator as independent whole numbers subject to the same operation. In this specific problem:

1.  **The Error Path:** A student correctly adds the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and correctly adds the numerators ($1 + 2 = 3$). However, they then apply the addition operation to the denominators as well ($5 + 5 = 10$).
2.  **Why this trap is potent here:** Because the denominators are **common** (both are 5), students who have a weak conceptual grasp of "size of the slice" vs. "number of slices" often feel an intuitive urge to "complete" the operation by adding every visible digit.
3.  **The Distractor Design:** Option D is specifically designed to exploit this "Add Everything" strategy. For a student struggling with the rule that common denominators remain constant, \(3 \frac{3}{10}\) looks like a more "complete" result than \(3 \frac{3}{5}\), where one of the fives seemingly "disappears."

This error is more likely here than in problems with unlike denominators because the student isn't forced to stop and find a Lowest Common Multiple, which usually triggers the "denominator rules" in their memory. Instead, the superficial simplicity of the identical denominators encourages the "add across" shortcut.
