One specific reason why students might find this question difficult relates to a **notational trap regarding the denominators during addition.**

Specifically, many students struggle with the intuition that a denominator represents the *size* of the pieces rather than a quantity to be summed. Because the operation sign is a plus (+), there is a strong cognitive impulse to apply that operation to every number visible in the expression. This leads to the common error of adding the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$).

A student falling into this trap would correctly add the whole numbers ($2+1=3$) and the numerators ($1+2=3$), but then incorrectly add the denominators to arrive at **Option D ($3 \frac{3}{10}$)**. 

This error is often reinforced if the student has recently practiced multiplication of fractions (where one *does* multiply the denominators) or if they lack a visual "area model" understanding that two-fifths and one-fifth of the same-sized whole still result in fifth-sized pieces.
