One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conflict between the order of operations ($PEMDAS$) and the left-to-right reading habit**, specifically regarding the interaction between the exponent and the coefficient.

A significant number of students will likely choose **Option A (0.81)** due to a "Left-to-Right Execution" error. In this scenario, the student incorrectly multiplies the base by the coefficient before applying the exponent:

1.  **The Error:** $(3 \times 0.3)^2$
2.  **Step 1:** $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$
3.  **Step 2:** $0.9^2 = 0.81$

**Why this is a specific trap:**
*   **Notational Proximity:** In the expression $3x^2$, the '$3$' and the '$x$' are physically adjacent, leading students to mentally "group" them as a single term $(3x)$ to be squared, rather than treating the exponent as having higher priority and applying only to the $x$.
*   **Decimal "Alignment":** $0.9^2$ feels "cleaner" to a student than $3 \times 0.09$. When a student arrives at $0.81$, it feels like a "correct-looking" mathematical landmark, providing a false sense of security that reinforces the procedural error.

While an advanced student knows that exponents precede multiplication, the visual layout of $y=3x^2$ often triggers a reflexive left-to-right calculation, leading them directly to the distractor in Option A.
