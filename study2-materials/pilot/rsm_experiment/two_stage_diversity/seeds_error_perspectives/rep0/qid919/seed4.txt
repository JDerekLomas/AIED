A primary reason students find this question difficult is a **misplaced application of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/PEMDAS)**, specifically a tendency to multiply the coefficient before applying the exponent.

### The Specific Step: Linear Processing Trap
Students often read mathematical expressions from left to right as a string of commands. In the equation $y = 3x^2$, a common error is to perform the operations in the order they appear:
1.  **Step 1:** Multiply 3 by $x$ (3 × 0.3 = 0.9)
2.  **Step 2:** Square the result ($0.9^2$ = 0.81)

This leads them directly to **Distractor A (0.81)**. This error occurs because the notation "3x" implies a high degree of proximity, leading students to "bond" the 3 and the 0.3 together before addressing the "floating" exponent. They fail to prioritize the index/exponent over the multiplication.

### Why this specific context exacerbates the error:
The use of **decimals (0.3)** adds a layer of cognitive load. Students are so focused on calculating $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$ (and placing the decimal point correctly) that they "fatigue" and skip the conceptual check of operation priority. In contrast, if the value were an integer like $x=10$, a student might intuitively know $3 \times 10^2$ is 300 rather than 900, but the "unfamiliarity" of 0.3 makes them rely on a rigid (and in this case, incorrect) left-to-right processing strategy.
