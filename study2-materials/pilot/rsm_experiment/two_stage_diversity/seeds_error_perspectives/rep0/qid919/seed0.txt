As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **place value misalignment during the decimal squaring process** as the primary reason why students find this question difficult.

Specifically, students are highly prone to a **"placeholder error"** when squaring $0.3$, leading them to choose **Option D ($2.7$)**.

### The Mechanics of the Error:
A significant number of students correctly identify the order of operations ($x^2$ then multiply by $3$) but stumble on the decimal arithmetic. The difficulty lies in the following psychological and procedural trap:

1.  **Analogy to Whole Numbers:** Students think, "$3$ squared is $9$, so $0.3$ squared must be $0.9$." They treat the decimal point as a fixed separator rather than part of the value being multiplied. 
2.  **The Resulting Miscalculation:** If a student incorrectly determines that $0.3^2 = 0.9$, their final step is $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$. 

### Why this is a "Notational Trap":
This question is a "distractor-heavy" problem because $2.7$ (Option D) looks "more correct" to a student's intuition than $0.27$ (Option B). 

In many introductory algebra problems, students are conditioned to expect "cleaner" numbers. The correct calculation requires realizing that $(3 \times 10^{-1})^2 = 9 \times 10^{-2}$, or $0.09$. Because $0.09$ is an order of magnitude smaller than the starting $x$ value, students often undergo **"Magnitude Cognitive Dissonance."** They feel that squaring a number should make it "bigger" (based on their experience with whole numbers), so they unconsciously lean toward the larger distractor ($2.7$) rather than the correct, smaller-looking value ($0.27$).

**In summary:** The difficulty isn't the algebra ($y = 3x^2$), but rather the **failure to shift the decimal two places** when squaring $0.3$, which maps perfectly to the most tempting distractor.
