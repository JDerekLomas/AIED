One specific reason students find this question difficult is the **conflict between the order of operations ($PEMDAS/BIDMAS$) and the visual "left-to-right" reading habit**, specifically regarding the exponent.

In the expression $3x^2$, students frequently perform the multiplication before the squaring, calculating $(3 \times 0.3)^2$ instead of $3 \times (0.3)^2$. 

This error is exacerbated by the specific decimal chosen ($0.3$):
1.  **The "Invisible Parentheses" Trap:** Students often read $3x^2$ as a single unit where the $3$ and $x$ are already "glued" together. If they calculate $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ first, and then square it, they arrive at **0.81 (Option A)**. 
2.  **Reinforcement of the Error:** Because $0.9^2$ results in $0.81$—a number that "looks" mathematically plausible and uses the same digits commonly associated with $3$ and $9$—the student feels a false sense of confidence.

If a student correctly identifies that they must square $0.3$ first ($0.09$), they must then overcome a secondary decimal place value trap to reach $0.27$ rather than $2.7$, but the primary structural hurdle is resisting the urge to multiply the coefficient before handling the power.
