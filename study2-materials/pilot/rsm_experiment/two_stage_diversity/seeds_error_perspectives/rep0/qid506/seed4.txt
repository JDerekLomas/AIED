One specific reason students frequently struggle with this question is the **misapplication of the "multiplication by a common factor" heuristic**—specifically, mistakenly identifying the relationship between 3 and 12 as a division fact rather than a multiplicative one.

### The Specific Difficulty: The "12 ÷ 3 = 4" Mental Shortcut
Because the numbers **3** and **12** have a strong "math fact" association (most students instantly recognize that $12 \div 3 = 4$), students often bypass formal algebraic steps. When they see these two numbers in an equation, their brains prioritize the familiar quotient (4) over the inverse operation required by the structure of the equation.

**How the error manifests:**
1.  **Inverse Operation Error:** To isolate $p$, the student must divide by 3 (or multiply by $\frac{1}{3}$). However, because the right side of the equation is a fraction ($\frac{1}{12}$), students often subconsciously "move" the 3 to the denominator of the fraction and perform the division $12 \div 3$ instead of the multiplication $12 \times 3$.
2.  **Visual Processing:** The student sees the 3 on the left and the 12 in the denominator on the right. They intuitively think, *"How does 3 go into 12?"* They conclude it goes in 4 times, leading them to **Distractor A ($p = \frac{1}{4}$)** or **Distractor C ($p = 4$)**.

**Why this is a "Trap":**
This question is a classic "lure" for students who rely on **pattern matching** rather than **algorithm execution**. In equations like $3p = 12$, the answer is 4. In equations like $\frac{p}{3} = 12$, the answer is 36. By combining both (using a coefficient and a fraction), the problem creates a cognitive conflict where the student's most familiar "number bond" (3, 4, 12) overrides the actual rule of multiplying the denominators.
