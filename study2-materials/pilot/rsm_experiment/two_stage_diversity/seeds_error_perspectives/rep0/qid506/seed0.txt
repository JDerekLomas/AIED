As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify the most significant difficulty in this problem as the **misapplication of the "multiplication by association" shortcut**, which leads to the popular incorrect choice **A ($p = 1/4$)**.

Specifically, students frequently struggle with equations where the coefficient (3) and the denominator of the constant term (12) share a common factor or are multiples of one another.

### The Mechanism of the Error:
When students see a "3" and a "12" in an algebraic context, their brains are conditioned to recall the basic arithmetic fact $12 \div 3 = 4$. Instead of performing the formal inverse operation (dividing both sides by 3, or multiplying both sides by $1/3$), many students instinctively "move" the 3 to the right side and combine it with the 12 using the operation that feels most "natural" for those two digits.

Because $1/12$ is already a fraction, students often view the $3$ and the $12$ as being on the same "level" of the problem. This leads to a cognitive shortcut where the student simply calculates $12 / 3$ and keeps it in the denominator, resulting in $1/4$.

### Why this specific notation is a "trap":
*   **The Inverse Operation Error:** To solve correctly, the student must perform $1/12 \div 3$, which requires the "Keep-Change-Flip" algorithm: $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$.
*   **Cognitive Load:** For a student with fragile fractional fluency, multiplying $12 \times 3$ feels "wrong" because they expect the number to get smaller when solving for a variable in this configuration, or they mistake the coefficient 3 for its reciprocal ($1/3$) prematurely.

In summary, the presence of **multiples** (3 and 12) creates a **distractor effect** where the student performs a division that is arithmetically easy but algebraically incorrect, making Option A a high-frequency "lure."
