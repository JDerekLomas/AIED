As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify the most significant difficulty in this question as the **"Division by 3" vs. "Multiplication by 3" retrieval error**, specifically exacerbated by the visual structure of the fraction $1/12$.

### The Specific Difficulty: "Multiplicative Attraction" to the Factor 4

The most common trap for students here is a breakdown in the inverse operation process due to the **strong number sense association between 3 and 12.**

Many students, upon seeing the numbers 3 and 12, instinctively think of the factor 4. When solving $3p = 1/12$, the brain often performs a "shortcut" that bypasses the formal algebraic steps:

1.  The student recognizes that $3 \times 4 = 12$.
2.  They observe that the 12 is in the denominator.
3.  Through an intuitive but flawed logic, they conclude that $p$ must be $1/4$ because "3 of these fourths should make a twelfth" (reversing the actual relationship).

This leads them directly to **Distractor A ($p=1/4$)**. In their mind, they are dividing the denominator (12) by 3 rather than dividing the whole fraction by 3. 

### Why the notation makes this error likely:
In the equation $3p = 1/12$, the operation required to isolate $p$ is dividing both sides by 3, which is equivalent to multiplying the denominator by 3 ($1 / (12 \times 3)$). However, students struggling with **fraction division fluency** often default to one of two incorrect mechanical rules:
*   **Numerator-only focus:** They divide only the top number ($1 \div 3$) and get stuck.
*   **Denominator-only division:** They see the 3 on the left and the 12 on the right and perform $12 \div 3$, resulting in a denominator of 4.

The choice of $1/4$ is a "highly attractive" distractor because it yields a whole number (4) during the intermediate mental calculation, whereas the correct answer ($1/36$) requires the student to multiply $12 \times 3$, an action that feels counter-intuitive to those who associate "solving" with "simplifying" or "making numbers smaller."
