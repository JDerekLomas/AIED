One specific reason why students frequently struggle with this question is the **arithmetic trap of "familiar number partners."**

In introductory algebra, students are conditioned to look for common multiplication facts. When a student sees the numbers **3** and **12**, their brain often performs an automatic retrieval of the fact $3 \times 4 = 12$. 

This leads to a specific procedural error: instead of strictly following the algebraic rule of dividing both sides by 3 (which requires multiplying the denominator 12 by 3), the student intuitively "links" the 3 and 12 through division. They perform the operation $12 \div 3 = 4$ and mistakenly conclude that $p = \frac{1}{4}$ (Option A) or even $p = 4$ (Option C).

The difficulty lies in the fact that the **multiplicative relationship between the coefficient and the denominator** ($3 \times 12$) is counter-intuitive compared to the **division relationship** ($12 \div 3$) that students have spent years overlearning. The "presence" of the number 4 in the options acts as a powerful distractor that validates this incorrect intuitive leap.
