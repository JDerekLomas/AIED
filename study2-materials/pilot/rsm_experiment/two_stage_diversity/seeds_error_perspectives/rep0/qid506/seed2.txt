One specific reason why students frequently struggle with this question is the **arithmetic trap of "small-integer attraction"** when dealing with reciprocal operations.

Specifically, many students erroneously apply a "mental shortcut" where they focus on the numbers 3 and 12 in isolation. Because $12 \div 3 = 4$, students are cognitively drawn to the integer 4. This leads to two common incorrect pathways:

1.  **Inverse Misapplication (Distractor A):** The student recognizes they need to divide by 3, but instead of dividing the fraction $\frac{1}{12}$, they mentally simplify the relationship between 12 and 3 as $\frac{12}{3}$, leading to $p = \frac{1}{4}$.
2.  **Fractional Neglect (Distractor C):** The student sees the 3 and the 12 and instinctively performs the division $12/3 = 4$ without maintaining the reciprocal nature of the equation, simply discarding the fractional structure entirely.

**Why this is specific to this problem:**
If the equation were $3p = 15$, students would easily find $p=5$. However, because the constant is a unit fraction ($\frac{1}{12}$), the operation required is $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$. Students often find it counter-intuitive that dividing by a whole number results in a **smaller** fraction (a larger denominator), leading them to "correct" the problem into a simpler division ($12 \div 3$) that feels more familiar.
