One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **"notational orientation trap" regarding the position of $x$ and $y$ within the horizontal table.**

In standard school mathematics, tables of values are most commonly presented with $x$ in the top row (the independent variable) and $y$ in the bottom row (the dependent variable). However, because the linear equation $10x - 6y = 30$ is given in **standard form** ($Ax + By = C$) rather than **slope-intercept form** ($y = mx + b$), students often reflexively treat the missing value (the star) as the output of the process.

**The specific cognitive error:**
Students often read the table as a "function machine" moving from top to bottom. Despite the labels, a significant number of students will mentally map the given numerical value ($0.5$) to $x$ simply because $x$ usually comes "first" or "on top." This leads to the following common miscalculation:
1.  Assume $x = 0.5$.
2.  Substitute into the equation: $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$.
3.  Solve: $5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y \approx -4.16$.

Because this doesn't lead to a clear multiple-choice answer, the student faces a "choice paralysis." Conversely, those who correctly identify $y = 0.5$ must perform an algebraic manipulation—adding a negative term ($10x - 3 = 30$)—where the subtraction of the $6y$ term often leads to a **sign error** ($10x + 3 = 30 \Rightarrow x = 2.7$, leading to the distractor **D**).

The difficulty lies in the fact that the "start" of the calculation (the known value) is in the "result" row of the table, requiring students to work backward against the grain of typical table-reading habits.
