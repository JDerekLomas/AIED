One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **visual/positional trap regarding the order of operations when handling the negative sign.**

Specifically, students often make a **sign error** when substituting $y = 0.5$ into the term $-6y$. When they perform the calculation $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, they correctly find that $6 \times 0.5 = 3$. However, a common error at this step is to subconsciously "lose" the negative sign or incorrectly apply it during the transposition. 

There are two likely pathways for this error:
1. **The "Subtract-to-Add" Failure:** A student may correctly simplify the equation to $10x - 3 = 30$, but then mistakenly **subtract** 3 from 30 (getting $10x = 27$ and $x = 2.7$, **Option D**) instead of adding it. This happens because the brain occasionally triggers the operation it *sees* written down rather than the inverse operation required to solve for $x$.
2. **Implicit Negative Negation:** If the student views the equation as $10x - (6 \times 0.5)$, they may simplify it correctly. But if they view it as $10x + (-6 \times 0.5)$, they may arrive at $10x + (-3) = 30$, then proceed to subtract 3 because of the visible "+" sign or the proximity of the "3" to the equal sign.

The presence of **Option D (2.7)** is a high-functioning distractor designed specifically to catch students who correctly substitute the value but fail the integer arithmetic step required to isolate $x$.
