As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify a specific difficulty in the **inconsistent visual matching of the denominators**, which often triggers a flawed shortcut known as the "Add Everything" strategy.

### The Specific Difficulty: "Add Everything" due to the Coefficient Gap
The primary point of failure is the step where students attempt to find a common denominator. Because the denominators $2x$ and $x$ look very similar notationally, many students bypass the logic of equivalent fractions and apply a naive additive rule: adding the numerators ($3+4=7$) and adding the components of the denominators ($2x+x=3x$).

**Why this specific question invites that error:**
*   **The Trap (Distractor B):** Students see the "3" in $3/2x$ and the "4" in $4/x$ and instinctively want to see a "7" in the result. In their minds, they treat the denominators as separate terms to be combined rather than a shared scaling factor. They result in $\frac{7}{3x}$, which is listed as an option to catch this specific visual reflex.
*   **The Misconception of the "Hidden" Coefficient:** Students often struggle to recognize that the second fraction $\frac{4}{x}$ is equivalent to $\frac{8}{2x}$. Because the variable $x$ is already present in both, they feel they have "satisfied" the requirement for a common denominator. 

**Summary of the Error:**
A student correctly identifies that both terms involve $x$, but they fail to treat "2" as a multiplicative factor. Instead of multiplying the second fraction by $2/2$, they simply sum the visible constants, leading them to the **"notational trap" of $\frac{7}{3x}$** instead of the correct common-denominator-based sum of $\frac{11}{2x}$.
