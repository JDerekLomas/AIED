One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **failure to account for the "invisible" multiplier** in the common denominator, specifically when the variables already match.

Research suggests students often fall into the trap of **only adding the numerators** while ignoring the existing coefficients of the denominators. In this case, a student might see the $x$ in both fractions and decide that the denominator is simply $x$. They then mistakenly focus only on the numerators, leading to **Distractor D ($7/2x$)**.

The "trap" here is a misunderstanding of how to scale the second fraction. To achieve a common denominator of $2x$, the student must multiply the fraction $\frac{4}{x}$ by $\frac{2}{2}$. Many students intuitively understand they need a $2x$, but they perform a "half-scaling" error: they multiply the denominator by 2 to make it match, but **forget to multiply the numerator (4) by 2**. This results in the incorrect sum of $\frac{3+4}{2x} = \frac{7}{2x}$, rather than the correct $\frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.
