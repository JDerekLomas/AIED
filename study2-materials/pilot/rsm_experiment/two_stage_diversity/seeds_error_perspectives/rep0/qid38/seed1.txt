One specific reason students often find this question difficult is the **visual trap of "adding across,"** specifically regarding how they handle the unequal denominators.

Students commonly make the error of adding the numerators ($3+4=7$) and the constants in the denominators ($2+0$, or $2+1$ if they treat $x$ as $1x$), leading them to choose **Option D** ($\frac{7}{2x}$).

This specific error occurs because of a **partial application of fraction rules**:
1.  The student correctly identifies that the variable $x$ is common to both terms.
2.  However, they fail to recognize that $2x$ and $x$ are not "common denominators" as they stand.
3.  Because the terms look so similar, students often intuitively treat the $2$ in $2x$ as a coefficient that can remain static, similar to how one might add $\frac{3}{10} + \frac{4}{10}$.

Instead of performing the necessary step of finding an equivalent fraction ($\frac{4}{x} \times \frac{2}{2} = \frac{8}{2x}$), they simply "combine" the visible parts. The presence of $7$ in both Options B and D acts as a **distractor** that reinforces this intuitive but incorrect "adding across" logic.
