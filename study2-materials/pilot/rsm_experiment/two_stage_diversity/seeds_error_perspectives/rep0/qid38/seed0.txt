A primary reason students find this question difficult is a specific **visual trap involving the "cross-multiplication" shortcut (or the butterfly method)**, which often leads them to incorrectly choose **Option C**.

When students see fractions with different denominators, they are often taught to multiply the denominators together to find a common one ($2x \times x = 2x^2$). While mathematically valid, this specific problem sets a trap through the requirement to write it **"as simply as possible."**

The specific error progression is as follows:
1.  **Cross-multiplying numerators:** The student calculates $(3 \times x) + (4 \times 2x) = 3x + 8x = 11x$.
2.  **Multiplying denominators:** The student calculates $2x \times x = 2x^2$.
3.  **Resulting fraction:** The student reaches $\frac{11x}{2x^2}$.
4.  **Incomplete or incorrect simplification:** A student may struggle to simplify the $x$ terms properly. They see "11" and "$x$" in their work and gravitates toward **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$)**, incorrectly canceling the $2$ or failing to see that the denominators share a common factor ($x$) from the start.

Because the question uses algebraic terms ($x$ and $2x$) rather than just constants, students often default to these "rote" procedures rather than spotting the more efficient scaling method (simply doubling the second fraction to $\frac{8}{2x}$). This bypasses the simplest path to the correct answer, **Option A**, and pushes them toward the distractor options.
