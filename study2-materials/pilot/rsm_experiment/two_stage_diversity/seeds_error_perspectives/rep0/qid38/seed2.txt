One specific reason students often find this question difficult is the **visual trap of "adding across,"** specifically regarding the denominators.

A common student error involves treating the denominators like whole numbers to be added together ($2x + x$), leading them to select **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$)**. In this specific problem, students may successfully find the correct numerator (multiplying the second fraction by $2$ to get $\frac{8}{2x}$, then adding $3 + 8 = 11$), but then "finish" the addition by combining the denominators ($2x + x$) to create $3x$.

This error is more likely here than in simple numerical fractions because the algebraic notation of $2x$ and $x$ feels like a term-collecting exercise. Students may correctly apply the rule for numerators but mistakenly apply the "like-term" addition logic to the bottom of the fraction, failing to recognize that a common denominator must remain constant once found.
