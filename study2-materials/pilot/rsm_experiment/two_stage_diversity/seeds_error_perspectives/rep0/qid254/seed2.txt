One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conceptual status of zero as a value vs. a non-value.**

Many students struggle with the inclusion of 0 in the divisor of the mean. They often apply a "shortcut" where they perceive zero as "nothing" and therefore decide it should not be counted as part of the total number of items ($n$).

Specifically:
*   **The Trap:** A student might correctly add the numbers to get 15 but then see Option C ($\frac{15}{4}$) and assume it is correct because there are only four "meaningful" (non-zero) numbers.
*   **The Confusion in Option A:** While Option A correctly uses the divisor 5, students who view zero as a literal "null" may be confused by its absence in the numerator ($1+3+4+7$). Even though $0$ doesn't change the sum, its physical absence in the written addition makes Option A look "incomplete" to some, or makes Option C look more "consistent" (since there are four numbers in the top and 4 in the bottom).

This leads to a common error where students fail to distinguish between a **sum** (where 0 has no effect) and the **count** (where 0 is a mandatory data point).
