One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual and conceptual ambiguity of the number 0** within the set, specifically how it relates to the denominator of the mean formula.

In many primary and lower-secondary math problems, "0" is often treated as "nothing" or an absence of a value. This leads to a specific error where students correctly identify that adding zero does not change the sum (numerator), but then incorrectly conclude that it does not count as a data point in the total (denominator). 

Consequently, a student may look at Option A and think, **"The sum $1+3+4+7$ is correct, and there are 5 numbers, so this must be right,"** failing to notice that the inclusion of the "0" in the count of the denominator necessitates its inclusion in the expression of the sum for formal consistency, or conversely, choosing Option C because they believe the "0" should be ignored entirely ($n=4$).

However, the more subtle "trap" here is **Option B** and the **Order of Operations**. A student who understands that there are 5 numbers and that they must be added might be lured into Option B because it includes all the digits and a division by 5. They may overlook the fact that without parentheses, standard mathematical notation (BODMAS/PEMDAS) dictates that only the 7 is divided by 5 ($7 \div 5$), rather than the entire sum.
