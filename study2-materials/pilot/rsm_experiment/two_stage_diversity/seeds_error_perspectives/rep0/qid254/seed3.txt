One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conceptual role of the number zero** within the mean formula.

In many contexts, students are taught that zero represents "nothing," leading to the misconception that it can be ignored during the calculation of an average. This specific set of numbers ($0, 1, 3, 4, 7$) triggers a common error in step-processing:

*   **The Trap:** Because the first term is $0$, students may mentally omit it during the summation, seeing only four "meaningful" numbers.
*   **The Consequence:** This leads them to believe the divisor (the $n$ in the formula $\frac{\sum x}{n}$) should be **4** rather than **5**. 
*   **The Result:** A student following this logic will select **Option C** ($\frac{1+3+4+7}{4}$), incorrectly assuming that since zero doesn't change the sum, it should not count as a data point.

Conversely, a student who recognizes that $0$ represents a measured value (like "0 goals scored") will identify **Option A** as correct, as it correctly accounts for the total count of observations ($n=5$) despite the sum ($15$) being the same as the sum of the non-zero digits.
