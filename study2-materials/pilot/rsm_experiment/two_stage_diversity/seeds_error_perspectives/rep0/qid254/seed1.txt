A primary reason students find this question difficult is the **conceptual status of zero as a placeholder vs. a value**, which leads to a conflict between Options A and C.

Specifically, many students hold a "non-entity" misconception regarding zero. When calculating a mean, they recognize that adding zero does not change the sum (the numerator). Because the zero doesn't "contribute" to the total, students frequently conclude that it should not contribute to the count of items (the denominator).

This leads to a specific predictable error:
*   The student looks at the set $\{0, 1, 3, 4, 7\}$.
*   They physically count four "active" or "value-holding" numbers.
*   They choose **Option C** because the denominator matches the number of non-zero digits.

The presence of Option A acts as a "notational trap" that reinforces this error. Because $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$ is mathematically identical to $1 + 3 + 4 + 7$, Option A looks numerically correct in the numerator. A student who misunderstands the role of zero will see $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ and think, *"They included the 0 in the count (5) but it’s not in the sum,"* leading them to erroneously prefer Option C or assume the question is flawed.
