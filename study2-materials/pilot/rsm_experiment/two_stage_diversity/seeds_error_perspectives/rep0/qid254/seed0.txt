A primary reason students find this question difficult is the **conceptual status of the number zero as a data point.**

Specifically, students often succumb to the **"Zero is Nothing" fallacy**, which leads them to select **Option C**.

**The specific cognitive hurdle:**
In the context of calculating a mean, many students treat $0$ as an "empty" value that does not contribute to the total and, therefore, should not be counted in the divisor ($n$). They correctly identify that $0$ does not change the sum in the numerator ($0+1+3+4+7 = 15$), and because of this "invisibility" in addition, they instinctively reduce the count of items from five to four.

This error is exacerbated by the phrasing of Option A vs. Option C:
*   In **Option A**, the numerator $1+3+4+7$ is mathematically identical to $0+1+3+4+7$. A student might see this as "correct" but then get confused by the divisor of $5$. 
*   In **Option C**, the student sees the four non-zero digits ($1, 3, 4, 7$) and a divisor of $4$. This creates a "false harmony" where the number of visible terms matches the divisor, leading them to believe that because the $0$ "doesn't count" toward the sum, it shouldn't count toward the average.

Therefore, the presence of the $0$ acts as a **distractor for the divisor**, forcing students to choose between a divisor that reflects the number of *nonzero* values (4) and the actual number of *observations* (5).
