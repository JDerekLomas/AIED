One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **notational trap** regarding the **horizontal fraction bar (vinculum)** as a grouping symbol.

Specifically, many students fail to realize that the fraction bar in $\frac{1+k}{4}$ acts as an implicit parenthesis, meaning the operation is $15 = (1+k) \div 4$.

When moving to **Step 2**, students who successfully navigated Step 1 often default to "undoing" the $+1$ by adding it to both sides ($60+1$) rather than subtracting it ($60-1$). This is because, visually, the $+1$ and the $k$ are sitting atop a resolved denominator, and students may instinctively seek to "move" the number to the other side to "combine" it with the $60$, losing track of the inverse operation. This leads them to conclude that Step 2 ($61=k$) is correct, resulting in choosing option **C (Both steps correct)** instead of the actual answer, **A (Only step 1)**.
