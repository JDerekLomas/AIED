A primary reason students find this question difficult is a **misunderstanding of the inverse relationship between the left and right sides of the equation**, specifically when moving from Step 1 to Step 2.

In this problem, the specific difficulty lies in the **incorrect application of the subtraction property of equality.**

**The Concrete Reason: The "Balance Scale" Reversal Error**
Students often look at the equation in Step 1 (\(60 = 1 + k\)) and see the "$1$" and the "$60$" and instinctively know they must combine them. Because they are habituated to seeing larger numbers "receive" the smaller number, a student may fall into the trap of thinking: *"To get $k$ alone, I need to put the $1$ with the $60$."*

Instead of performing the inverse operation (subtracting $1$ from both sides), the student performs the operation **indicated by the sign already there** (addition). They essentially move the $+1$ across the equals sign without changing its sign, or they treat the equals sign as a "summation prompt" rather than a balance point. This results in $60 + 1 = 61$, leading them to believe Step 2 is correct.

**Why this specific question is a "trap":**
The number $61$ feels "right" to a struggling student because $60$ and $1$ are mathematically related to $61$. If Step 2 had resulted in a nonsensical number like $75$, the student would be more likely to spot the error. Because $61$ is the result of a **sign error**—one of the most common mechanical mistakes in algebra—students who lack "operational fluency" will likely select **(C) Both steps are correct**, failing to recognize that Step 2 required subtraction (\(60 - 1 = 59\)).
