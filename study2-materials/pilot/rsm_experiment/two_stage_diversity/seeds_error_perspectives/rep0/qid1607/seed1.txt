One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **misinterpretation of the additive inverse when "undoing" an addition (specifically in Step 2).**

Research in algebra education suggests that students often internalize the "change the side, change the sign" shortcut as a mechanical movement rather than a logical operation. In Step 1, the student correctly multiplies by 4 ($60 = 1 + k$). However, in Step 2, a student may look at the "1" and the "60" and incorrectly conclude that to move the 1 across the equals sign, they should **add** it to 60 because they see a positive sign, rather than **subtracting** it.

This error is compounded by the **asymmetric layout** of the equation. Because $1 + k$ is on the right-hand side, students who are habituated to equations being formatted as "Variable = Number" may mentally "push" the 1 onto the 60 without correctly applying the inverse operation, leading them to believe Step 2 is correct ($61 = k$) and choosing option C (Both steps) instead of the correct option A.
