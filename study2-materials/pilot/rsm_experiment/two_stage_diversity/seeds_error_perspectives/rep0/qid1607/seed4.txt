One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **visual and procedural "sign-flipping" trap** that occurs between Step 1 and Step 2.

In Step 2, Isaac arrives at $61 = k$ because he incorrectly adds 1 to 60 ($60 + 1$) instead of subtracting 1 ($60 - 1$). This specific error is common due to two factors:

1.  **Additive Commutativity Confusion:** When students see the expression $1 + k$, they subconsciously treat "1" as the primary operator for the entire side of the equation. Because the "1" is positive, their instinct is to "move it over" by adding it to the other side, rather than performing the inverse operation (subtraction) required to isolate the variable.
2.  **Number Neighbor Bias:** The proximity of $60$ and $1$ creates a strong cognitive urge to reach a "clean" number or simply follow the operation they see on the page ($+$). Many students see the plus sign in $1+k$ and reflexively apply addition to the left-hand side ($60+1$) rather than mentally performing the balance method ($60 - 1 = 1 - 1 + k$).

This makes the question a effective trap because Step 1 (multiplying by 4) feels so logically sound that students often carry that momentum into Step 2, selecting "Both steps are correct" (Choice C) because 61 "looks" like a plausible result of 60 and 1.
