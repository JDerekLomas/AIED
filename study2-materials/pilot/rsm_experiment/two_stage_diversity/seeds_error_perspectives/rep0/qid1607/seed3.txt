One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **"visual symmetry" trap** in Step 2, caused by the **Additive Inverse Error**.

After successfully performing the inverse operation of multiplication in Step 1 ($15 \times 4 = 60$), many students struggle with the final movement of the $+1$. Instead of seeing the equation as a balance scale that requires "subtracting 1 from both sides," students often apply a flawed "move and change" shortcut where they subconsciously prioritize **combining digits**.

Specifically, the proximity of $60$ and $1$ on the same side of the visual equals sign ($60 = 1 + k$) triggers a cognitive "short circuit": 
*   The student knows the numbers 60 and 1 must be combined.
*   Because 1 is "added" to $k$, the student's brain defaults to the most basic arithmetic operation associated with that symbol: **$60 + 1 = 61$**. 
*   They fail to recognize that to "undo" the addition of 1, they must perform the opposite operation (subtraction).

Because $61$ looks like a "natural" progression from $60$ and $1$, students will frequently select **(A) Only Step 1** if they are checking carefully, or mistakenly select **(C) Both steps are correct** because $61$ feels like a numerically plausible "neighbor" to 60.
