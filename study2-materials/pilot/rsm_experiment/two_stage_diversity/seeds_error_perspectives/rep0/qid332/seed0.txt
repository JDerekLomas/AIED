One specific reason why students find this question difficult is the **notational ambiguity of the "invisible bracket"** in Katie’s approach, which leads to a common "distributive property" error.

When Katie multiplies by 3, many students incorrectly believe her resulting line ($x - 5 = 36$) is valid because they perceive the subtraction as separate from the division. This stems from a misunderstanding of the **fraction bar as a grouping symbol.**

Specifically:
*   **The Error:** Students often forget that if you multiply the entire left side of the equation by 3, the multiplier must apply to *every* term ($\text{term-by-term multiplication}$). They see the $x$ "over" the 3 and "cancel" it out, but they view the $-5$ as an independent entity that does not need to be multiplied.
*   **The Trap:** Because Katie’s result for the right side ($12 \times 3 = 36$) is correct, and her result for the first term ($x$) is correct, the error in the middle term ($5$) is less "loud." 

A student who prioritizes "moving numbers to the other side" over maintaining **balance via equality** will likely choose **C (Both)**. They recognize Tom’s standard "Add 5 first" method is correct, but they lack the structural understanding to see why Katie’s "Multiply by 3 first" method requires the result to be $x - 15 = 36$, not $x - 5 = 36$.
