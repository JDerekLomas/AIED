As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant challenge in this question as the **incorrect distribution of the multiplier in Katie's method**, a common error driven by the **notational visual cues** of the fraction bar.

### The Specific Difficulty: The "Limited Reach" of the Multiplier
Many students will incorrectly conclude that **both** are correct (Option C) because they fail to recognize that Katie’s operation violates the property of equality regarding terms.

**The "Visual Trap" of the Vinculum:**
Students often perceive the fraction $\frac{x}{3}$ as an isolated object rather than part of a collective expression. When a student attempts to "multiply by 3" to "get rid of the fraction" (as Katie does), they often suffer from a cognitive gap where they only multiply the term *containing* the fraction, rather than the entire side of the equation.

**Why this specific error happens here:**
*   **The Selective Multiplier:** Students intuitively feel that since the $3$ is "under" the $x$, its power only extends to that $x$. In Katie’s line ($x - 5 = 36$), she has correctly multiplied the $\frac{x}{3}$ and the $12$ by 3, but she has "skipped" the $-5$.
*   **Order of Operations Misconception:** Students frequently generalize a "rule" that you can start an algebraic solution with any operation. Because multiplying by 3 *does* cancel the denominator, they believe it is a legal "shortcut" without realizing that it creates an extra step of distribution ($3( \frac{x}{3} - 5)$) which would require the $-5$ to become $-15$.

**The Researcher's Conclusion:**
Students who choose **C (Both)** are often proficient enough to know that multiplication is the inverse of division, but they lack the structural understanding that an operation must be applied to the **entire side** of an equation. The visual separation of the $-5$ from the fraction $\frac{x}{3}$ leads them to believe it is "safe" from the multiplication, making Katie’s incorrect line seem mathematically plausible.
