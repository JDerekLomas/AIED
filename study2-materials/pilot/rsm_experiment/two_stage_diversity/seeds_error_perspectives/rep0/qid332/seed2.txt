A primary reason students find this question difficult is the **visual "order of operations" trap regarding the division bar.**

Specifically, students often struggle with the scope of the denominator, leading to an incorrect application of the multiplication property of equality.

**The Notational Trap: Fractional Scope**
In the expression $\frac{x}{3} - 5$, the division bar is "short"—it only sits under the $x$. However, a common misconception in early algebra is that to "get rid of" a fraction, one must multiply the entire side of the equation by the denominator.

Many students will see Katie’s suggestion ($x - 5 = 36$) and find it intuitive because they perform the operation:
$$3 \times \left(\frac{x}{3}\right) - 5 = 12 \times 3$$
They successfully multiply the term $\frac{x}{3}$ and the constant $12$ by 3, but **fail to distribute the 3 to the $-5$.** 

**Why this makes the question hard:**
1.  **Selective Arithmetic:** Students often prioritize "undoing" the fraction because it looks like the most complex part of the equation.
2.  **Misinterpreting Katie's logic:** Katie’s move looks mathematically "elegant" to a struggling student because it clears the fraction immediately. Without a firm grasp of the distributive property (that the 3 must multiply *every* term on the left side to maintain equality), Katie’s answer appears just as valid as Tom’s. 

Consequently, students frequently choose **(C) Both**, incorrectly assuming there are two equally valid "starting paths," failing to realize that while you *can* multiply by 3 first, it would require Katie to say $x - 15 = 36$.
