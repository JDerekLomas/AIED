One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual trap of "closeness"** involving the order of operations, specifically leading them to choose **Option A (Only Tom)** when Option C is correct.

**The Notational/Conceptual Trap:**
Students are often taught the heuristic "SAMDIB" (the reverse of PEMDAS/BODMAS) for solving equations, which dictates that you should undo Subtraction/Addition before Division/Multiplication. 

Because the \(-5\) is visually separated from the fraction \(\frac{x}{3}\) by a subtraction sign, it looks "further away" and easier to move first (leading to Tom’s correct step: \(\frac{x}{3}=17\)). Conversely, the denominator \(3\) is physically "glued" to the \(x\). This makes Katie’s move—multiplying the entire equation by 3—look visually counterintuitive or "illegal" to many students.

**Why they struggle with Katie's step:**
The specific difficulty lies in the **distributive requirement** of multiplying a multi-term side. Many students incorrectly believe that if you multiply by 3 to "cancel" the denominator, it only affects the fraction. Katie’s step (\(x - 5 = 36\)) is actually **incorrect** because she failed to multiply the \(-5\) by \(3\) (it should be \(x - 15 = 36\)). 

However, because many students **also** forget to multiply the "floating" constant when they try to clear fractions, they will see Katie’s line, perform the same common error in their heads (\(3 \times \frac{x}{3} = x\) and \(3 \times 12 = 36\), while ignoring the \(5\)), and conclude that her math is correct. This leads to the **Specific Difficulty**: a student may choose "Both" (Option C) because they share Katie's specific conceptual blind spot regarding the distributive property over subtraction.
