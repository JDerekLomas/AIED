One specific reason why students find this question difficult is the **visual "local" application of inverse operations**, which leads many to believe Katie is correct.

Students are often taught that the "opposite of divide by 3 is multiply by 3." When looking at Katie’s suggestion, students often focus locally on the term $\frac{x}{3}$ and "move" the 3 to the other side to get $12 \times 3 = 36$. Because $x-5=36$ looks like a balanced algebraic step, it bypasses the student's intuition for the **distributive property**.

**The Trap:**
Specifically, students often fail to recognize that the $-5$ is a separate term not included in the numerator. They incorrectly apply the multiplication to only two "ends" of the equation ($x$ and 12) while neglecting the "middle" term ($-5$). 

Because $x-5=36$ appears to follow the "rule" of doing the same thing to both sides (multiplying by 3), it serves as a **notational trap** where the visual separation of the $-5$ from the fraction $\frac{x}{3}$ is ignored. Students who rely on procedural shortcuts rather than conceptual equality will often choose **(C) Both**, incorrectly validating Katie’s line of working because they see "36" and assume the 3 was moved correctly.
