One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conflict between "two negatives make a positive" and the process of combining like terms.**

While many students correctly remember the rule for multiplication ($ -5 \times -7 = +35 $), they often experience "rule interference" when performing the middle step of the expansion: $-5m - 7m$.

Mathematically, a student may follow these steps:
1. First, $m \times m = m^2$
2. Outside/Inside, $-7m$ and $-5m$
3. Last, $-5 \times -7 = +35$

The difficulty arises when consolidating the middle terms. Because the student has just activated the rule that "multiplying two negatives creates a positive" to get the constant $+35$, they frequently misapply that logic to the addition of the linear terms, calculating $-5m - 7m$ as $+12m$. This makes **Option C** a high-frequency "distractor" for students who understand the mechanics of FOIL/expanding but have fragile mastery of directed number operations under cognitive load.
