As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle in this question as the **application of the distributive property to two negative constants**, specifically when determining the final term of the quadratic.

**The "Negative $\times$ Negative" Sign Error**

The primary difficulty lies in the calculation of $(-5) \times (-7)$. In the expansion process (often taught via the FOIL method), the "Last" step requires students to multiply two negative integers.

There is a common cognitive interference where students, overwhelmed by the "negativity" of the expression $(m-5)(m-7)$, subconsciously default to a negative product. Students often perform the correct multiplication of absolute values ($5 \times 7 = 35$) but apply the wrong sign rules, or conflate the rules of addition (where $-5 - 7 = -12$) with the rules of multiplication.

**Why this makes Option D a powerful "Visual Trap":**
*   **The Linear Term Influence:** In the "Inner/Outer" step, students calculate $-5m - 7m = -12m$. Having just written down a negative value ($-12m$), the student is in a "subtraction" mindset.
*   **Logical Consistency Bias:** Many students feel that since both original brackets involve subtraction, the final result "should" involve subtraction or negative signs throughout.
*   **Distractor Analysis:** Option D ($m^{2}-12 m-35$) is the most frequent "wrong" answer because it correctly handles the linear term but fails on the sign of the constant. A student who relies on "eyeballing" the problem often sees the two minus signs in the brackets and expects to see two minus signs in the expanded form.

Therefore, the specific difficulty is the **switching of sign-operation rules** mid-problem: transitioning from the addition of negatives (to get $-12$) to the multiplication of negatives (to get $+35$).
