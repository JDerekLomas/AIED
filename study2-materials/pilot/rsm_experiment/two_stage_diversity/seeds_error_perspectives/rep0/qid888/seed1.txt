One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **arithmetic of signed integers in the final term**, specifically the "double negative" multiplication versus addition.

A common cognitive hurdle is that students must perform two different operations using the same two negative integers ($-5$ and $-7$):
1.  **Algebraic Addition (Linear term):** They must combine $(-5) + (-7)$ to get $-12m$.
2.  **Multiplication (Constant term):** They must multiply $(-5) \times (-7)$ to get $+35$.

Many students struggle with "sign fatigue" by the final step of the FOIL/expansion process. After correctly identifying the negative linear coefficient ($-12$), they may impulsively apply the rule "a negative and a negative make a negative" from their addition logic to the multiplication step. This leads them to select **Option D** ($m^2 - 12m - 35$), as they carry the "negative feeling" of the expression through to the end, forgetting that the product of two negatives must yield a positive constant.
