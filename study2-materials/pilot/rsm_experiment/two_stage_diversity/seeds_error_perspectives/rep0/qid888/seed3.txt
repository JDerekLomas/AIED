One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **arithmetic of signed integers in the final step (the constant term)**.

Specifically, many students struggle with the multiplication of two negative constants, $(-5) \times (-7)$. 

In the process of expanding $(m-5)(m-7)$, a student may correctly identify that they need to multiply the two numbers, but due to a common misconception regarding negative signs, they may conclude that "a negative and a negative stay negative." This leads them to calculate the product as $-35$ rather than $+35$.

**The Impact on Choice:**
This specific error leads them directly to **Distractor D** ($m^2 - 12m - 35$). This is a particularly high-probability error because the student has successfully performed the more complex algebraic task of combining the middle terms $(-5m - 7m = -12m)$ correctly, leading to a "false sense of confidence" that their final sign choice for the constant is also correct.
