A primary reason students find this question difficult is the **arithmetic of directed numbers in the final step (the constant term)**, specifically the "double negative" multiplication rule versus the addition rule.

When applying the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) method or a grid method, students must calculate $(-5) \times (-7)$. This specific operation acts as a "notational trap" for the following reason:

Students often struggle with the cognitive load of switching between **multiplication** (for the last term) and **addition** (for the middle term) while handling negative signs:

1.  **The Multiplication Error:** A student may correctly identify that $5 \times 7 = 35$, but because they see two minus signs, their intuition might incorrectly revert to the "feel" of subtraction, leading them to conclude the answer must be $-35$. This makes **Distractor D** a very common "low-confidence" choice.
2.  **The Sign Confusion:** In the previous step, the student likely calculated $-5m - 7m = -12m$. Having just performed an addition where two negatives stayed negative, the student may "carry over" that logic to the multiplication step, incorrectly assuming $(-5) \times (-7)$ must also be negative. 

By providing **Distractor B** (correct) alongside **Distractors A and D**, the question specifically targets those who can correctly manage the sum $(-12m)$ but fail the product logic of the constant term.
