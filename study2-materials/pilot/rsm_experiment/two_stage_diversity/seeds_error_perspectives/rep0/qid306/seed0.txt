As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle in this problem as the **literal interpretation of the "A" before "S" in the PEMDAS/BODMAS mnemonic**, which specifically triggers a visual trap in **Problem P**.

### The "Addition before Subtraction" Trap
The specific reason many students will incorrectly choose **Option D** (identifying $5+6$ as the first step in Problem P) is due to the **hierarchical misinterpretation of operator precedence.**

Students are often taught "Order of Operations" via mnemonics where Addition (A) physically precedes Subtraction (S). This leads to a robust mental rule that addition must be performed wherever it appears in an expression before subtraction is addressed.

**Why this is specific and concrete in Problem P:**
1.  **Spatial Positioning:** In the expression $4 - 5 + 6$, the addition sign is flanked by the digits $5$ and $6$. This creates a strong "perceptual grouping." A student who prioritizes "A over S" will see the $5+6$ as a discrete unit to be solved first ($11$), leading to the incorrect calculation $4 - 11 = -7$.
2.  **Failure of the "Left-to-Right" Rule:** Mathematically, addition and subtraction hold equal priority and should be executed from left to right. However, the mnemonic acts as a "shortcut that fails here." Because the mnemonic lists "A" before "S," it overrides the left-to-right convention in the student's mind.
3.  **The Option D Lure:** Option D is particularly dangerous because the student may correctly identify that multiplication comes first in Problem Q ($5 \times 6$), giving them a false sense of confidence. This "correct" half of the answer validates their "incorrect" reasoning for Problem P, leading them to believe that the rule is consistently "do the operation that appears furthest right/highest in the mnemonic."

In summary, the difficulty lies in the student's transition from a **sequential mnemonic** to the **associative reality** of operators; they treat the mnemonic as a rigid flowchart rather than a grouping of equal-priority operations.
