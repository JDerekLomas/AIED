As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **"Left-to-Right Overgeneralization" of addition within the PEMDAS/BIDMAS mnemonic** as the primary reason students find **Problem P** specifically difficult, often leading them to choose **Option D**.

### The Specific Difficulty: The Addition vs. Subtraction Priority Trap

In Problem P ($4 - 5 + 6$), many students rely on the literal string of letters in mnemonics like **BODMAS** or **PEMDAS**. Because 'A' (Addition) precedes 'S' (Subtraction) in these acronyms, students frequently develop a "lexicographical" misconception: they believe addition must *always* be performed before subtraction, regardless of their position in the expression.

**Why this is a "visual and notational trap" in this specific problem:**

1.  **The "Plus" as an Anchor:** In the expression $4 - 5 + 6$, the $+$ sign is a strong visual cue. Students who adhere strictly to the "Addition first" rule will isolate $5 + 6$ first.
2.  **The Sign Attachment Error:** When students decide to do $5 + 6$ first, they often "drop" the subtraction sign or fail to realize that the sign belongs to the $5$ (treating it as $-5 + 6$). Instead, they treat the operation as $4 - (5 + 6)$, resulting in $4 - 11 = -7$.
3.  **The Distractor Conflict:** This makes **Option D** a highly attractive "distractor." A student may correctly identify that Multiplication comes before Addition in Problem Q ($5 \times 6$), but because they apply the "A before S" rule in Problem P, they are funneled toward an incorrect choice despite having half of the Order of Operations knowledge correct.

**The Concrete Failure:**
While the mathematical rule is that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be solved left-to-right, the **notational structure of the acronym** (putting A before S) acts as a "hidden curriculum" that teaches the opposite, making Problem P significantly harder for students who are diligent but literal-minded.
