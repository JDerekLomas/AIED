One specific reason why students often find this question difficult is due to a **rigid, literal interpretation of the PEMDAS/BODMAS mnemonic**, specifically regarding the "A before S" (Addition before Subtraction) rule.

In **Problem P**, the operation involves only addition and subtraction ($4 - 5 + 6$). Because the "A" appears before the "S" in common mnemonics, many students incorrectly believe that addition must *always* be performed first, regardless of its position in the string. 

This leads to a specific procedural error:
1.  Students isolate the addition component: $5 + 6$.
2.  They treat the minus sign as a separator rather than an operator attached to the $5$.
3.  They conclude the first step is $5 + 6$, leading them to select **Option C or D**.

This error is exacerbated by the visual layout of the numbers. In many languages, we read left-to-right, but the "Order of Operations" acronym acts as a "stronger" secondary rule in a student's mind. They perceive the "Add" rule as an override to the "Left-to-Right" rule, causing them to hunt for the addition sign first. Consequently, they fail to recognize that addition and subtraction hold equal priority and should be processed from left to right.
