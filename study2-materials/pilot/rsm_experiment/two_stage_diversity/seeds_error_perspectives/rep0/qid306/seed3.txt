As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **"Left-to-Right Overgeneralization"** in Problem P as a specific reason students find this question difficult, particularly when selecting between options B and D.

### The Specific Difficulty: The Addition Prioritization Trap
The most common point of failure is a **literal, non-hierarchical application of the PEMDAS/BODMAS mnemonic** in Problem P.

Many students are taught the acronyms in a way that implies a fixed sequence: **A**ddition comes before **S**ubtraction. In Problem P ($4 - 5 + 6$), this leads to a "Visual Grouping Error":
*   Students see the plus sign and, conditioned by the mnemonic, feel compelled to perform $5 + 6$ first.
*   This leads them to choose **Option D**, because they believe they must prioritize the "A" over the "S" regardless of position.

### Why this is a "Notational Trap"
The trap is exacerbated by the **physical layout** of the numbers. In the string $4 - 5 + 6$, the $5$ and $6$ are joined by a plus sign, which "looks" like a stable unit ($11$). Because the minus sign precedes the $5$, a student who chooses Option D often incorrectly simplifies the expression to $4 - 11$, rather than understanding that the operator associated with $5$ is negative.

### Contrast with Problem Q
The question is designed to catch students who have a "flat" understanding of order of operations. While they will likely get Problem Q right (because multiplication *is* higher rank), they fail Problem P because they do not realize that **Addition and Subtraction hold equal priority** and must be solved strictly left-to-right. Therefore, a student may correctly identify $5 \times 6$ in Q, but incorrectly identify $5 + 6$ in P, leading them directly to the "distractor" answer D.
