As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant hurdle in this problem as the **literal application of the "A" (Addition) before "S" (Subtraction) in the PEMDAS/BODMAS mnemonics.**

### The Specific Difficulty: The "Addition First" Trap in Problem P

The primary reason students struggle with this specific pair is a **misinterpretation of operator hierarchy hierarchy.** Students often learn order of operations through mnemonics where Addition (A) physically precedes Subtraction (S).

**Why it is a trap in Problem P:**
In the expression $4 - 5 + 6$, the correct procedure is to work from left to right because addition and subtraction hold equal priority. However, many students believe they must perform all addition in a problem before any subtraction. This leads to two specific procedural errors:

1.  **The Over-Generalization Error:** A student looks at $4 - 5 + 6$ and identifies $5 + 6$ as the first step because "A comes before S." This leads them to select **Option C or D**.
2.  **The Sign Misconception:** If a student attempts $5 + 6$ first, they often ignore the negative sign attached to the $5$. They calculate $11$, and then try to perform $4 - 11$. If they are not comfortable with negative integers, they may further double back in confusion or conclude that the "first step" must have been the subtraction simply because it was on the left, but they do so without a clear understanding of parity.

**Contrast with Problem Q:**
The mnemonic works "correctly" (by coincidence of layout) for Problem Q ($4 + 5 \times 6$), as Multiplication (M) does indeed come before Addition (A). This creates a cognitive dissonance where the student’s rule-of-thumb works for one half of the question but fails the other, specifically because **Problem P requires understanding that operations of equal rank must be processed left-to-right.**

**Conclusion:**
The question is difficult because **Option D** serves as a "Mnemonic Bait." It rewards students who strictly follow the alphabetical/sequential order of PEMDAS/BODMAS letters ($+$ before $-$; $\times$ before $+$) rather than the actual underlying mathematical rules of operator precedence.
