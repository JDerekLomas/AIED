One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **conflict between "additive" and "multiplicative" processing of the integers $-1$ and $-4$.**

When expanding brackets, a common cognitive slip is for students to switch operations mid-calculation. Because students are conditioned to "collect like terms" (addition/subtraction) at the end of the FOIL/expansion process, they often apply that same logic to the individual terms.

**The "Addition Trap":**
A student may correctly identify the terms as $-1$ and $-4$ but mentally perform **$-1 - 4$** or **$(-1) + (-4)$** instead of multiplication. This leads them directly to **Option D ($-5$)**. 

This error is exacerbated by the phrasing of the question. Even though it asks what she gets when she "multiplies," the visual presence of two negative signs often triggers a "move further left on the number line" heuristic (subtraction) rather than the "double negative equals positive" rule of multiplication. This specific distraction makes Option D a high-frequency "distractor" for students who understand which terms to use but fail to maintain the correct operational mode.
