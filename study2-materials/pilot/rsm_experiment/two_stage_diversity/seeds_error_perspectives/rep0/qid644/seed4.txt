As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **simultaneous handling of the additive identity and sign multiplication** as the primary reason why students might find this specific question difficult.

Specifically, many students are susceptible to **"Additive-Multiplicative Interference"** when processing the numbers -1 and -4.

### The Specific Reason: Confusion between "Sum" and "Product"
While the student may know they are "expanding brackets" (a process of multiplication), the presence of the number **-1** acts as a cognitive distractor. 

In many arithmetic contexts, students are taught that "negative 1 and negative 4 make negative 5." This additive logic is deeply ingrained because $-1 - 4 = -5$ is a common early-algebra operation. Because $-5$ (Option D) is provided as a plausible distractor, students who fail to switch their mental "operator" from addition to multiplication will select it. 

**Why this is a "visual/notational trap":**
The arrows point at two standalone terms separated by brackets. A student's brain might skip the conceptual framework of the FOIL/Area method and simply perform the simplest operation available between the two highlighted digits:
1. **The Sign Error:** $- \times - = +$ (This is where Option B is filtered out).
2. **The Operator Error:** Applying addition instead of multiplication. If the student thinks "minus one and minus four," their internal monologue often leads to "total of minus five" rather than "product of positive four."

**The Result:** 
A student who understands that a negative times a negative is a positive might still pick **Option C (+5)** because they correctly handled the signs but performed **$1 + 4$** instead of **$1 \times 4$**. Conversely, the most common error in this specific item is likely **Option D (-5)**, where the student defaults entirely to additive logic.
