A primary reason students find this question difficult is the **conflict between "integer arithmetic rules" and "visual cue processing" regarding the minus signs.**

Specifically, students often fail to correctly **package the negative sign as a property of the term** rather than an operation between the terms.

### The Specific Difficulty: "Operator-Operand Dissociation"
In the expression $(2p - 1)(3p - 4)$, many students view the minus signs merely as "the instruction to subtract" rather than seeing the terms as $(-1)$ and $(-4)$.

When following the arrow from the $1$ to the $4$:
1.  **The "Absence of Sign" Error:** A student may focus purely on the digits and calculate $1 \times 4 = 4$. They then look at the two minus signs in the brackets and, rather than applying the "negative times a negative equals a positive" rule, they treat the subtraction signs as a single instruction that carries over to the result, leading them to choose **B) $-4$**.
2.  **The Additive Trap:** Because students are conditioned to associate "expanding brackets" with an increase in value or "putting things together," they may subconsciously switch from multiplication to addition. Seeing two negative numbers, they perform $-1 + (-4)$ to get $-5$, leading them to **D)**.

### Why this specific question is a "trap":
The visual layout of the arrows explicitly directs the eye to the **end** of each bracket. In many introductory algebra problems, students are used to seeing $(x + 2)(x + 3)$. In those cases, the sign is often ignored because it is positive. This question forces a confrontation with the sign; if a student has a fragile understanding of directed numbers, they will likely treat the $1$ and $4$ as "raw numbers" and then "tack on" a sign based on a misguided intuition (e.g., "there are minuses in the brackets, so the answer must be minus") rather than the formal algebraic rule.
