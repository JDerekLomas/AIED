A specific reason students find this question difficult is the **conflict between "integer arithmetic rules" and "visual proximity."**

In this problem, many students will select **Option D (-5)** because of a common cognitive error in algebra known as **operation misidentification.** 

Specifically, when a student sees the $-1$ and the $-4$ in such close proximity, their brain may default to **combining** them (addition/subtraction) rather than **multiplying** them. In the context of expanding brackets, the "inner" terms of the FOIL method are visually nestled together. A student might think, "I need to put $-1$ and $-4$ together," and mentally calculate $-1 - 4 = -5$.

This error is more likely here than in other bracket expansion questions because:
1.  **Symbolic Confusion:** The term "multiply" in the prompt requires a deliberate retrieval of a rule (negative $\times$ negative = positive), while the visual layout of $(-1)(-4)$ often triggers the more automatic response of "collecting terms" ($1$ and $4$ make $5$, keep the sign).
2.  **The "Addition Shortcut":** Students who are accustomed to the pattern of $x^2 + (a+b)x + ab$ (for monic quadratics like $(x-1)(x-4)$) often get the middle term by adding the constants. Here, even though the question specifically asks for the multiplication step, the ingrained habit of adding constants to find parts of the expansion can lead them to reflexively choose $-5$.
