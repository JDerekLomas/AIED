One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **arithmetic trap of "Operation Overlap,"** specifically leading to the distractor **D) -5**.

When students see the numbers **-1** and **-4** in an algebraic context, a common cognitive slip is to perform **integer addition** instead of the required **multiplication**. 

In the expansion of brackets (often taught via the FOIL method), the step-by-step process requires alternating between multiplying terms and later "combining" (adding) like terms. Because the visual prompt isolates these two constants, many students instinctively treat them as a standalone calculation: $-1 - 4$. Since both numbers are negative, the student may mentally "sum" their absolute values and keep the sign, resulting in **-5**. 

This error is exacerbated by the "multiplication vs. addition" sign rules:
1. Students remember "a negative and a negative make a positive" (correct for multiplication, leading to **+4**).
2. Students also remember "if you are already at -1 and take away 4, you go deeper into the negatives" (correct for addition/subtraction, leading to **-5**).

Because students often struggle to switch fluently between these two rule sets mid-problem, they are highly likely to select D if they misidentify which operation the arrow indicates.
