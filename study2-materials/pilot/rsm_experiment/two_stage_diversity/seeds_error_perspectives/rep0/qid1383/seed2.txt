One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **notation-dependency of the negative sign in relation to the exponent**, which often leads students to select option **C (-81)**.

Specifically, when substituting $k = -3$ into the expression $k^4$, students must conceptually process $(-3)^4$. However, many students rely on calculator logic or memorized visual patterns where $-3^4$ is interpreted as $-(3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3)$.

The cognitive difficulty arises from "The Squaring Fallacy" extended to higher even powers: 
Students often internalize that "a negative number times itself is positive" for $k^2$, but they frequently fail to apply the **nesting property of even exponents**. They may mentally compute $3^4 = 81$ and then simply "reattach" the negative sign from the original $k$ value, treating the substitution as $-3^4$ (leading to $-81$) rather than the required $(-3)^4$. This error is exacerbated by the fact that many scientific calculators will return $-81$ if the student types $-3 \wedge 4$ without parentheses, reinforcing the misconception that the sign exists independently of the power.
