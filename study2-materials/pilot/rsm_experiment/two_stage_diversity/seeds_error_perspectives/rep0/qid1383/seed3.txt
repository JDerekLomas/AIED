One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **notation of the negative base when squaring or exponentiating**, specifically the common failure to distinguish between \((-3)^4\) and \(-3^4\).

**The Trap:**
When a student is asked to substitute \(k = -3\) into \(T = k^4\), they must mentally or physically process the calculation as \((-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)\). However, many students perform the calculation as if the negative sign is separate from the exponentiation. 

**Why this occurs here:**
- **The "Even Power" misconception:** Some students internalize the rule that "even powers result in positive numbers" but fail to apply it correctly because they calculate $3^4 = 81$ and then reflexively re-attach the negative sign from the original $k$ value, leading them to choose **C (-81)**.
- **Calculator Reliance:** If a student uses a scientific calculator and types `-3^4` instead of `(-3)^4`, the device will follow the order of operations by exponentiating 3 first and then applying the negative sign. This reinforces the error, making the incorrect choice (C) appear "mathematically verified."

Consequently, although the calculation only requires basic multiplication, the **notational ambiguity of the negative sign** acting as a coefficient versus part of the base is the primary obstacle.
