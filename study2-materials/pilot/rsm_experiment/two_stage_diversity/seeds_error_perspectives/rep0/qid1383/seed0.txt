One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **notation-dependency of the negative sign when applying an even exponent.**

In many calculators and programming languages, if a student inputs $-3^4$, the system follows the order of operations by applying the exponent before the negation (interpreting it as $-(3^4)$), resulting in $-81$. To get the mathematically correct result for $k = -3$ in the equation $T = k^4$, a student must conceptualize the substitution with parentheses: $T = (-3)^4$.

Because students are often conditioned by their technology or a literal left-to-right reading of the symbols, they may fail to realize that the negative sign is "attached" to the value of $k$ and must therefore be multiplied four times. This leads them to mistakenly choose **Option C (-81)**, falsely believing that an even exponent does not "cancel out" a negative sign unless brackets were explicitly written in the original equation.
