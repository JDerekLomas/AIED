One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **notation-dependent handling of the negative base**, specifically when distinguishing between $(-3)^4$ and $-3^4$.

The central difficulty lies in whether a student correctly applies the exponent to the negative sign. In mathematics education research, this is often linked to **"order of operations" interference**. When students see $k=-3$, they must perform a substitution. A significant number of students fail to treat the substituted value as a single entity (effectively $(-3)^4$), and instead mentally calculate it as $-3^4$.

This leads to the following specific error chain:
1.  The student substitutes $-3$ but does not use parentheses.
2.  They interpret $-3^4$ as "the negative of 3 to the fourth power."
3.  They calculate $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$ and then re-apply the negative sign.
4.  This leads them to incorrectly choose **Option C (-81)**.

Even if a student knows that "a negative times a negative is a positive," the visual layout of $k^4$ does not provide the "containment" of parentheses. Research suggests that students are more likely to get this right if the question were written as $T = (k)^4$ than they are when it is written as $T = k^4$, as the latter requires them to supply the grouping structure themselves during the substitution phase.
