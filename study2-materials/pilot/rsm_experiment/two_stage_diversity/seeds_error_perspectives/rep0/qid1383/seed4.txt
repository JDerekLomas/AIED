One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **notation of exponentiation versus negation**, specifically the misconception regarding the order of operations when substituting a negative base.

In mathematical notation, there is a distinct difference between $(-3)^4$ and $-3^4$. When students substitute $k = -3$ into $T = k^4$, they often fail to treat the negative sign as part of the base being raised to the power.

Instead of correctly evaluating:
$(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$

Many students interpret the calculation as:
$-(3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3) = -81$

This error is compounded by "calculator dependence." If a student enters `-3^4` into many standard scientific calculators without parentheses, the device follows strict PEMDAS logic (Exponentiation before Multiplication/Negation) and outputs **-81**. Because Option C is a provided distractor, students are "confirmed" in this error, making them less likely to re-examine their logic. 

**Conclusion:** The trap is not the arithmetic itself (multiplication), but the **notational ambiguity** of whether the negative sign is "attached" to the number 3 or the result of the exponentiation.
