As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the most significant difficulty in this question as the **left-to-right processing conflict within the Additive/Subtractive operations.**

Specifically, students are prone to making the **"Addition before Subtraction" error**, often reinforced by the literal mnemonic sequence of "PEMDAS" or "BODMAS," where the letter 'A' precedes 'S'.

### The Specific Mechanism of Error:
While many students will correctly identify the Multiplication step ($4 \times 2 = 8$) first, they often falter at the resulting expression: $3 - 5 + 8$.

Instead of treating addition and subtraction as inverse operations of equal priority to be solved from left to right, a significant number of students believe they must perform **all** addition before **any** subtraction. This leads to the following logic:
1.  **Multiply first:** $4 \times 2 = 8$.
2.  **Add next (The Error):** The student sees "$- 5 + 8$" or simply the "plus" sign and mistakenly groups the numbers as $3 - (5 + 8)$.
3.  **Result:** $3 - 13 = -10$.

### Why this specific question targets this trap:
The choice of Distractor **D (-10)** specifically targets this misunderstanding of operator precedence. This error is compounded by a visual "trap" in the notation: in many elementary curricula, "addition" is framed as a "combining" action, making it cognitively more attractive to resolve the $5+8$ as a "package" before addressing the "take away" subtraction at the start of the string.

In contrast, the correct left-to-right application ($3 - 5 = -2$; then $-2 + 8 = 6$) requires the student to hold a negative value in their working memory or understand that the negative sign is attached to the $5$, a conceptual leap that many students bypass by defaulting to the "Addition first" rule.
