A primary reason students find this question difficult is a **notational/structural trap** related to the **left-to-right rule for addition and subtraction.**

Specifically, many students erroneously treat addition as having a higher priority than subtraction (often due to the alphabetical or sequential ordering of "A" before "S" in mnemonics like PEMDAS or BODMAS). In this expression, this leads to the **"addition first" error**:

1.  The student correctly performs the multiplication ($4 \times 2 = 8$).
2.  The student looks at the remaining expression: $3 - 5 + 8$.
3.  Because of the mnemonic, they isolate the addition operation: **$5 + 8 = 13$**.
4.  They then perform the final subtraction: $3 - 13 = \mathbf{-10}$.

This results in **Option D**, which acts as a powerful "procedural distractor." The difficulty lies in the fact that the negative sign belongs to the $5$ (treating it as $3 + (-5) + 8$), but students visually perceive the $+$ symbol between the $5$ and the $8$ as an instruction to group those two absolute values together before addressing the subtraction. 

The student fails to realize that subtraction and addition are inverse operations of equal priority and must be solved from left to right ($3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 8 = 6$).
