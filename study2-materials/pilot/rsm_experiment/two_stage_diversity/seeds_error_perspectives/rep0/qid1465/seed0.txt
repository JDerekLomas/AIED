A primary reason students find this question difficult is a specific misinterpretation of the **Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)**, specifically regarding the relationship between subtraction and addition.

### The "Addition before Subtraction" Trap
Many students are taught the mnemonic acronyms (like PEMDAS) literally, leading them to believe that **Addition must always precede Subtraction** because "A" comes before "S" in the acronym.

**The Concrete Error:**
A student following this rigid, incorrect hierarchy will skip the initial subtraction ($3-5$) and move straight to the addition and multiplication. They will correctly perform $4 \times 2 = 8$, but then perform:
\[5 + 8 = 13\]
The final calculation then becomes:
\[3 - 13 = -10\]

**Why this feature makes the error more likely:**
In this specific problem, the subtraction operator precedes the addition operator ($3 \mathbf{-} 5 \mathbf{+} 8$). To get the correct answer (6), the student must process the addition and subtraction **left-to-right**. 

If the problem were written as $3 + 4 \times 2 - 5$, the "Addition before Subtraction" error would not matter, as the left-to-right order would match the acronym order. However, because the subtraction appears first, the problem specifically exposes students who rely on the acronym's letter order rather than the conceptual "level" (where addition and subtraction have equal priority). 

This is why **Option D (-10)** is a powerful "distractor" in this question; it validates a very common procedural misconception.
