One specific reason why students might find this question difficult—and likely choose the incorrect answer **B (4)**—is the **left-to-right processing conflict with addition and subtraction**.

Specifically, many students are taught the PEMDAS/BODMAS mnemonic in a way that suggests **Addition (A) must always be performed before Subtraction (S)**.

In this expression, $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$, once the student correctly performs the multiplication ($4 \times 2 = 8$), they are left with:
\[3 - 5 + 8\]

A student following a strict "Addition before Subtraction" rule will ignore the left-to-right convention and incorrectly group the addition first:
1.  They add $5 + 8$ to get $13$.
2.  They then subtract that sum from the initial $3$.
3.  Calculation: $3 - 13 = -10$ (Answer D) or, more commonly, they find the difference and ignore the sign, or they interpret it as $(3 - 5) + 8$, but they prioritize the "plus" sign visually. 

**However, the most acute "trap" in this specific problem is the "sum-of-negatives" error.** A student might see $-5 + 8$ and, lacking fluency with directed numbers, treat it as $3 - (5+8)$, leading them to $-10$. 

Alternatively, if a student treats the subtraction as an operator attached to the 5 ($3$ and $-5$), they may incorrectly calculate $3 - (5 + 8)$ instead of adding 8 to the result of $3-5$. The specific visual layout of seeing a "minus" followed by a "plus" often triggers the mnemonic-based urge to "do the plus part first," leading to the incorrect result of $4$ if they miscalculate the $3-13$ or simply struggle with the order of operations between two adjacent additive operators.
