A primary reason students find this question difficult is a **notational/procedural trap** involving the misapplication of the **"Addition before Subtraction"** rule within the PEMDAS/BODMAS mnemonic.

Specifically, many students interpret the "A" before "S" as a strict hierarchy rather than a left-to-right priority. In this expression, this leads to a "Middle-First" grouping error:

1.  The student correctly identifies that multiplication comes first: $4 \times 2 = 8$.
2.  The expression remains: $3 - 5 + 8$.
3.  Because "Addition" comes before "Subtraction" in the acronym, the student mistakenly groups the **$5 + 8$** first, treating the subtraction sign as if it were a separator rather than an operator tied to the 5 (or treating it as $3 - (5 + 8)$).
4.  They calculate $5 + 8 = 13$.
5.  They finish with $3 - 13 = -10$.

This leads them to **Distractor D**. This error is specifically triggered because the addition sign (+) appears physically to the left of the multiplication but to the right of the subtraction, tempting students who have memorized the acronym strictly but do not understand that addition and subtraction are inverse operations of equal priority.
