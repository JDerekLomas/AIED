One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "Gestalt" trap of the repeated numbers**, which leads to an erroneous application of the **Distributive Property**.

Students often perceive the expression $8 + 12 \div 4$ and $(8 + 12) \div 4$ as a demonstration of the rule $a + (b \div c) = (a + b) \div c$. Because the numbers $8, 12, \text{ and } 4$ appear in the exact same left-to-right order on both sides of the box, students who have a fragile grasp of the Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BIDMAS) often assume the expressions are **equivalent** (Choice C) without calculating.

The psychological pull of this trap is reinforced by two factors:
1.  **Similarity to legitimate distribution:** Students are trained that $x(y+z) = xy + xz$. They may intuitively but incorrectly extend this "grouping" logic to division, assuming that moving the parentheses does not change the total value as long as all components are present.
2.  **Left-to-Right Processing:** A student reading from left to right may see $8 + 12$ as the primary unit in both expressions—either because it appears first (on the left) or because it is grouped (on the right). This leads them to perform the addition first on both sides ($20 \div 4 = 5$), overlooking that on the left side, the division $12 \div 4$ must be prioritized, resulting in $8 + 3 = 11$.

Consequently, the most common error is choosing **C (=)** due to a visual "pattern match" rather than a computational analysis.
