One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **"Visual Distillation" trap**, where students ignore the mathematical operators and treat the problem as a comparison of the numbers alone.

Specifically, because the four numbers involved ($8, 12, 4$ and $8, 12, 4$) are identical and appear in the same order, students often suffer from **structural blindness**. They see a "parallel" layout and instinctively jump to the conclusion that the expressions are equivalent (**Option C**), assuming the parentheses are merely a grouping formality that doesn't change the underlying "ingredients."

This error is exacerbated by a specific breakdown in the Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
*   On the left side, the **precedence of division over addition** is frequently missed. A student might calculate $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$ on both sides because the physical proximity of "8 + 12" makes it "feel" like a single unit that should be processed first.
*   The left side ($8 + 3 = 11$) requires the student to actively "break up" the first two numbers, while the right side ($20 \div 4 = 5$) encourages them to "join" them. 

The visual symmetry of the problem acts as a **strong "Equal Sign" prime**, making students less likely to perform the actual computation and more likely to rely on pattern matching.
