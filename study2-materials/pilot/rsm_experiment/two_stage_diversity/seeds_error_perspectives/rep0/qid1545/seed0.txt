One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "Gestalt" trap of the repeated digits**, which triggers an incorrect application of the distributive property.

### The Specific Error: False Distributivity
Students often see the numbers $8$ and $12$ repeated on both sides of the box and intuitively feel that the right-hand expression—where the addition is grouped by parentheses—is simply the "formalized" or "proper" way of writing the expression on the left.

Specifically, a student may subconsciously invoke a "division-over-addition" version of the distributive property ($a+b \div c$) but fail to recognize that the standard Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) prevents this.

**How the trap functions:**
1.  **Right side:** A student correctly calculates $(8+12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.
2.  **Left side (The Error):** Because the $12$ is adjacent to the $\div 4$, and the $8$ is part of the same number set they just saw, the brain tends to group the terms that "look" like they belong together. A student might compute $8+12$ first on the left side as well, thinking: *"It's all the same numbers, so they must be equal,"* or *"I need to add the numbers before I divide them."*
3.  **Result:** They calculate $20 \div 4 = 5$ for the left side, leading them to choose **C) \( = \)**.

The difficulty lies in the fact that the **left side** requires a "counter-intuitive" move: moving past the addition ($8+12$) to perform the division ($12 \div 4$) first. The visual symmetry of the two expressions makes the priority of division harder to "see," as the eye wants to process the numbers $8$ and $12$ as a single unit on both sides.
