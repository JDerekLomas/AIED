One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "Parallelism Trap"** created by the identical sequence of numbers on both sides.

In this expression, both sides feature the numbers **8, 12, and 4** in the exact same order, using the same operations. This setup triggers a specific cognitive shortcut: the **Left-to-Right Linear Bias**. 

Many students treat a mathematical expression as a "sentence" to be read from left to right. Because the operations $(+, \div)$ appear in the same sequence, a student may overlook the impact of the parentheses on the right side. They might intuitively feel that because the "raw materials" are identical, the result must be the same, leading them to choose **C) \( = \)**.

The difficulty lies in resisting the visual symmetry to perform the proper Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
*   **On the left:** The division must happen first ($12 \div 4 = 3$), then the addition ($8 + 3 = 11$).
*   **On the right:** The parentheses force the addition first ($8 + 12 = 20$), then the division ($20 \div 4 = 5$).

Students who prioritize the visual pattern of "8, 12, and 4" over the structural hierarchy of the parentheses will fail to recognize that the right side significantly reduces the "weight" of the 8 by subjecting it to the division, whereas the 8 on the left stands independently.
