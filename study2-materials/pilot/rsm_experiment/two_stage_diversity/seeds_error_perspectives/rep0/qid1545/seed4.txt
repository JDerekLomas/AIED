One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "Gestalt" trap of the repeated digits ($8, 12, 4$), which triggers an intuitive but incorrect assumption of equality.**

Because the numbers and the operations (addition and division) are identical on both sides of the box, students often focus on the "ingredients" of the expression rather than the structural relationship defined by the parentheses. This leads to a specific error:

**The Distributive Property Illusion**
Students frequently over-generalize the distributive property. They see $12 \div 4$ on the left and $(8+12) \div 4$ on the right and intuitively feel that "division distributes over addition" in a way that should make the expressions equivalent. They might mentally justify Choice C (=) by incorrectly thinking that since $12$ is being divided by $4$ on both sides, the only difference is the placement of the $8$.

The specific cognitive "shortcut" that fails here is:
*   **On the left:** $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$
*   **On the right:** $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$

Students who rely on "scanning" rather than calculating often conclude that since the left side "ends" with $12 \div 4$ and the right side "contains" $12 \div 4$, the $8$ must simply be "waiting to be added" in both scenarios. They fail to realize that on the left, the $8$ is a whole integer, while on the right, the $8$ is also being divided by $4$. The similarity of the notation $12 \div 4$ appearing in both expressions acts as a "decoy" that suggests a symmetry that does not exist.
