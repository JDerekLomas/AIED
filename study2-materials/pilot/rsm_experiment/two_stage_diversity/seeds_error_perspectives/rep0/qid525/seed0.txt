As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify the most specific difficulty in this question as the **"Additive Fraction Misconception,"** specifically linked to **Option D**.

### The Specific Difficulty: The "Add Everything" Strategy
Students frequently treat fractions as two independent sets of whole numbers (numerators and denominators) rather than single numerical values. 

**The Error Path:**
A student following this logic will:
1.  Add the whole numbers: $2 + 2 = 4$.
2.  Add the numerators: $7 + 1 = 8$.
3.  Add the denominators: $10 + 4 = 14$.
4.  Combine them into the mixed number: **$4 \frac{8}{14}$**.

### Why this is a "Visual Trap" in this question:
*   **Intuitive Alignment:** The structure of Option D mimics the visual structure of the original problem. The numbers 4, 8, and 14 all appear to be "logical" successors to the numbers in the prompt.
*   **False Reinforcement:** Because the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) add up correctly, the student receives immediate "positive feedback" that their strategy is working. This encourages them to apply the same faulty "add across" logic to the fractional parts.
*   **The Lure of Simplicity:** Finding a common denominator ($20$) requires several sub-steps (finding multiples, rescaling numerators). Adding across requires only one step. Students under "cognitive load" or those with weak conceptual understanding of denominator meaning will default to the operation that requires the least resistance.

In summary, **Option D** acts as a powerful "attractor" because it validates the most common procedural error in rational number arithmetic: treating the denominator as a count rather than a size of a part.
