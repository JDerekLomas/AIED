As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify a specific difficulty in the **reconciliation of fraction addition with non-equivalent denominators**, specifically the "add-across" error manifested in **Option D**.

**The Specific Obstacle: The "Freshman's Sum" Strategy**
Students often rely on a misguided intuitive shortcut known as the "Freshman's Sum," where they treat the numerator and denominator as independent whole numbers. In this specific question, a student might correctly add the whole numbers ($2 + 2 = 4$) but then incorrectly add the numerators ($7 + 1 = 8$) and the denominators ($10 + 4 = 14$).

**Why this is a "Visual Trap" in this question:**
1.  **Syntactic Parallelism:** The layout of $2 \frac{7}{10} + 2 \frac{1}{4}$ encourages a left-to-right processing of digits. To a student struggling with the concept of a "common unit," simply adding the "top" numbers and then the "bottom" numbers feels like a logical extension of the algorithm for whole-number addition.
2.  **Lure of Simplicity:** Option D ($4 \frac{8}{14}$) is specifically designed to catch this error. Because $8$ and $14$ are the direct results of $7+1$ and $10+4$, the student receives immediate "feedback" that their process was correct because the exact digits appear in the multiple-choice options. 
3.  **Bypassing Least Common Multiples (LCM):** This shortcut allows the student to bypass the cognitively demanding step of finding a common denominator (20). Students often find the leap from tenths and fourths to twentieths counter-intuitive because the number "20" does not appear anywhere in the original problem.

While **Option B** is the correct mathematical answer, **Option D** represents a significant "notational trap" that identifies whether a student understands that fractions represent parts of a whole (requiring common sizing) rather than two distinct whole numbers separated by a bar.
