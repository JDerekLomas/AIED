One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **“Add Everything” Trap**, which leads directly to the distractor **D ($4 \frac{8}{14}$)**.

When students are confronted with mixed numbers, they often attempt to apply the same intuitive logic used in fraction multiplication to addition. In this specific problem, a student may correctly add the whole numbers ($2 + 2 = 4$) but then mistakenly add the numerators ($7 + 1 = 8$) and the denominators ($10 + 4 = 14$) horizontally.

**Why this feature makes the error more likely:**
The numbers in this problem are "additive-friendly" enough to encourage this mistake:
1.  **Whole Number Distraction:** Because the whole numbers are identical ($2$ and $2$), the student immediately feels success by writing "$4$," which appears in two of the options.
2.  **Computational Ease:** Adding $10+4$ and $7+1$ is cognitively much easier than the correct procedural path (finding the least common multiple of $10$ and $4$, which is $20$, and then scaling the numerators).
3.  **Presence of the Distractor:** Because $4 \frac{8}{14}$ is listed as Option D, it validates the student’s incorrect "add across" intuition, leading them to select it without questioning the need for a common denominator.
