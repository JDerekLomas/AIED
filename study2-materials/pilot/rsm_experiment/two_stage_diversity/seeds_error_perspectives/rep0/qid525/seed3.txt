As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the **incorrect "addition of components" strategy** as a specific feature that leads students to choose **Option D**.

### The Specific Difficulty: The Common Denominator Fallacy
A significant number of students find this question difficult because they attempt to treat the fractions as they would treat the whole numbers: by adding the components horizontally.

1.  **The Error Pathway:** The student adds the whole numbers ($2 + 2 = 4$) and then adds the numerators ($7 + 1 = 8$) and the denominators ($10 + 4 = 14$). 
2.  **The Visual Trap:** This leads them directly to **$4 \frac{8}{14}$**, which is explicitly listed as a distractor (Option D). 

### Why this specific feature makes the error more likely:
*   **Intuitive Interference:** Students are often taught that "addition is putting things together." Since $2+2=4$ and $7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$ are all basic arithmetic truths, the student perceives this path as logical and efficient.
*   **Reinforcement from Multiplication:** Students often confuse the rules for fraction operations. Since you *do* multiply denominators when multiplying fractions (e.g., $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6}$), they incorrectly generalize this "straight across" logic to addition.
*   **Failure of Estimation:** A student who lacks "fraction sense" will not realize that $\frac{7}{10}$ (more than a half) plus $\frac{1}{4}$ must result in a value nearly equal to $1$. Because $\frac{8}{14}$ is slightly more than $\frac{1}{2}$, it "looks" like a plausible answer to someone not checking for a common denominator.

While Option B is the correct result of finding the common denominator ($20$), Option D acts as a powerful "recognition trap" for students at the developmental stage of treating fractions as two separate whole numbers rather than a single ratio.
