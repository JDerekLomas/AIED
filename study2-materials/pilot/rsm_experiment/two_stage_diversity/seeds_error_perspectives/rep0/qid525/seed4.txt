As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify the most significant difficulty in this question as the **notational trap of "component-wise addition,"** which leads students to Option D.

**The specific difficulty: Common Denominator Avoidance via Whole-Number Logic**
Students frequently treat the components of mixed numbers as independent whole numbers. In this specific problem, students may add the whole numbers ($2 + 2 = 4$) and then apply the "add across" strategy for the fractions (adding numerators: $7 + 1 = 8$; adding denominators: $10 + 4 = 14$).

**Why this feature makes the error more likely:**
The denominators in this question, 10 and 4, do not have a trivial relationship (one is not a multiple of the other), which necessitates finding a least common multiple (20) or a common product (40). To avoid the cognitive load of finding a common denominator, students revert to the intuitive but incorrect rule of treating fractions like integers. 

Option D ($4 \frac{8}{14}$) acts as a highly "attractive" distractor because:
1. It validates the student's correct addition of the whole numbers ($2+2=4$).
2. It uses all the digits present in the original fractions ($7, 10, 1, 4$).
3. It creates a "procedural illusion" of progress that mirrors how one adds simple integers, making it a very common stopping point for students who lack "fraction sense."
