As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the following specific reason why students often struggle with this question:

### The "Coefficients Flip" in Inverse Operations

A common specific error occurs during the step where the student must isolate $r^3$ from the volume formula:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \]

To solve for $r$, the student must multiply by the reciprocal of the coefficient fraction. Many students mistakenly "detach" the 3 and the 4 without maintaining their reciprocal relationship. Instead of multiplying $V$ by $\frac{3}{4}$, they succumb to a **visual placement error** where they see the 4 and $\pi$ on "top" and mistakenly move them in a way that results in Option B ($4V / 3\pi$).

**Why this specific error happens:**
In typical algebraic equations (like $2x = 6$), students are used to simply "moving the number to the bottom" to divide. When faced with a fractional coefficient combined with a constant like $\pi$, the cognitive load increases. A student may correctly recognize that $\pi$ should be in the denominator, but then fail to "flip" the $\frac{4}{3}$ fraction, simply keeping the 4 in the numerator and the 3 in the denominator out of habit. This leads them directly to the distractor **Option B**, rather than the correct **Option C**.

The difficulty lies not in understanding the volume of a sphere, but in the **multi-step literal equation manipulation** where multiple constants ($4, 3,$ and $\pi$) must be relocated simultaneously.
