As a mathematics education researcher, I identify the following specific reason for difficulty in this question:

### The "Reciprocal Flip" Error during Algebraic Transposition

Students often struggle with the transition from the volume formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ to isolating $r^3$, specifically regarding the coefficient $\frac{4}{3}\pi$.

**The Specific Trap:**
Many students memorize a procedure where "to move a fraction to the other side, you flip it." When faced with $V = \frac{4\pi}{3}r^3$, students must decide whether the $\pi$ belongs to the numerator (grouped with the 4) or stands alone. 

A common error occurs in the mental or written step:
$$\frac{V}{4/3} = \pi r^3 \implies \frac{3V}{4} = \pi r^3$$
At this point, students often experience a "cognitive load overflow" when moving the $\pi$. Instead of dividing by $\pi$ (placing it in the denominator), they may impulsively multiply by it because they are already in the "multiplication mode" used to move the 3. This leads them to **Option A** ($\frac{4V\pi}{3}$), where they have correctly handled the 3 and 4 but incorrectly placed the $\pi$ in the numerator.

**Why this matters here:**
The distractors are designed to exploit this exact procedural "glitch." **Option C** is the correct result of dividing $V$ by the entire block $(\frac{4}{3}\pi)$. However, if a student treats the $4$, the $3$, and the $\pi$ as three separate steps rather than one single coefficient, the likelihood of a "reciprocal flip" error increases significantly with each additional step of the transposition.
