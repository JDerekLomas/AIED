One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual trap of reciprocal rearrangement** during the algebraic manipulation step.

When students begin with the standard formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, the most common error occurs in the transition to isolating $r^3$. Specifically, many students struggle with the treatment of the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ and the coefficient $\pi$. 

**The specific point of failure:**
To isolate $r^3$, one must multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction ($\frac{3}{4}$) and divide by the coefficient ($\pi$). This creates a specific "cross-over" confusion:
*   Students often see the "4" and "3" and mentally "attach" the $\pi$ to whichever number is moving. 
*   If a student incorrectly treats the expression as $( \frac{4\pi}{3} ) \cdot r^3$, they may intuitively feel that to "undo" this, they should multiply the volume $V$ by the fraction as it stands, leading them to **Option A** ($\frac{4V\pi}{3}$), rather than flipping the fraction.
*   Alternatively, students often forget that $\pi$ is in the numerator. They may correctly move the 3 and 4 but leave $\pi$ in the numerator, resulting in a derivation where $\pi$ stays multiplied by $V$ instead of moving to the denominator.

**Option C** is the correct answer, but **Option B** acts as a specific "distractor" for those who correctly handle the 3 and 4 but conceptually place $\pi$ in the wrong part of the fraction during the division phase. This manipulation requires three distinct movements (moving 3 to the top, 4 to the bottom, and $\pi$ to the bottom), and many students "drop" one of these logic steps, leading them to select an answer where only two of the three components are correctly placed.
