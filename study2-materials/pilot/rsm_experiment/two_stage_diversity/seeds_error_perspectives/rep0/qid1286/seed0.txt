One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **fractional division trap** when isolating $r^3$.

In the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, the student must perform a two-step algebraic manipulation (or division by a fraction) to move the $\frac{4}{3}$ to the other side. A common error occurs when students multiply both sides by the numerator ($4$) rather than the denominator ($3$), or simply fail to "flip" the fraction when dividing. 

This specific difficulty is targeted by **Option B**. A student who incorrectly associates the 4 with the "top" of the operation or incorrectly multiplies by $\frac{4}{3}$ (getting $\frac{4V}{3}$) rather than multiplying by the reciprocal $\frac{3}{4}$ will reach $\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}$. Because Option B looks visually similar to the standard sphere volume coefficients, students often pick it based on "pattern recognition" of the numbers $4$ and $3$ rather than performing the rigorous inverse operation.
