As a researcher in mathematics education, I identify the following specific reason why students may find this question difficult:

### The "Co-efficient Inversion" Trap during Rearrangement

The primary obstacle is the specific multi-step algebraic manipulation required to isolate $r$ from the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

Students frequently struggle with the **reciprocal relationship** when moving the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ to the other side of the equation. A common procedural error is "visual transposition," where a student sees the $3$ and $4$ and inadvertently multiplies the volume by the fraction as it stands ($V \times \frac{4}{3}$) rather than multiplying by the reciprocal ($V \times \frac{3}{4}$). 

This specific error leads directly to **Distractor A**, which contains the expression $\frac{4V}{3}$. Because $\frac{4}{3}$ is the coefficient students are most used to seeing in the original volume formula, it possesses a high "visual familiarity." A student who lacks a robust grasp of inverse operations will choose A because it "looks like" the numbers from the formula they memorized, failing to recognize that isolating the variable requires the inverse ratio.
