One specific reason why students frequently find this question difficult is the **"larger divided by smaller" heuristic**, which leads them to select **Option C ($p=2$)**.

**The Specific Error:**
Many students possess a deep-seated mental rule that division is an operation where you take the larger number and divide it by the smaller number to get a whole number result ($10 \div 5 = 2$). In this specific equation, when a student attempts to isolate $p$, they often perform a "switch" or a multiplication but unconsciously prioritize the calculation they are most comfortable with ($10/5$) rather than the mathematically required one ($5/10$).

**The Visual Trap:**
The notation $\frac{5}{p}$ presents the 5 on top. When students move to isolate $p$ (e.g., $10p = 5 \implies p = 5/10$), they experience **cognitive interference** because the 10 is numerically larger. To avoid the perceived "difficulty" of a fraction resulting in a decimal, the brain defaults to the familiar $10 \div 5$ dividend-divisor relationship.

Because Option C ($p=2$) is present as a distractor, it validates this incorrect intuition, preventing the student from re-evaluating their inverse operations.
