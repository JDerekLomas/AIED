As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **"Commutativity of Division" misconception** (specifically regarding the position of the unknown in the denominator) as a primary reason why students find this question difficult, leading them specifically to **Option C**.

### The Specific Difficulty: "Inverse Position Misconception"
Many students struggle when the unknown ($p$) is the **divisor** rather than the dividend. In typical introductory algebra ($10 = 5p$), students are trained to "divide by the number you see" to isolate the variable. When they see $10 = \frac{5}{p}$, they often default to one of two cognitively "lazy" pathways that feel mathematically intuitive but are incorrect:

1.  **Operation Reversal:** Instead of performing the correct algebraic steps ($10 \times p = 5$), the student maintains the division structure but flips the roles of the numbers because they prefer dividing a larger number by a smaller one ($10 \div 5$). This leads them directly to **$p = 2$**. 
2.  **Visual Association:** Students often subconsciously read the equation as "What number relates 10 and 5?" Since $5 \times 2 = 10$, they select **2** without checking the structural placement of the $p$.

### Why this is a "Notational Trap"
In a typical "easy" equation like $p = \frac{10}{5}$, the dividend (10) is the larger number. When the positions are swapped as they are here ($10 = \frac{5}{p}$), students must grapple with the fact that the answer will be a fraction ($0.5$). Many middle-school students hold a primitive conceptual model that **"division makes things smaller,"** making the idea that $5 \div 0.5 = 10$ feel counter-intuitive. 

Option C acts as a "powerful distractor" because it rewards the student for recognizing a familiar fact family ($5, 10, 2$) while ignoring the fractional logic required by the denominator’s position.
