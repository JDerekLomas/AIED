One specific reason why students frequently find this question difficult is the **"commutable operator" trap**, where students incorrectly assume that division is commutative, similar to addition ($5+p$) or multiplication ($5 \times p$).

**The Specific Error:**
Students often look at the numbers $10$ and $5$ and instinctively apply the operation that feels "natural" based on their mental multiplication tables, rather than the algebraic structure. Because $10 \div 5 = 2$, they assume that $p$ must be $2$.

**The Cognitive Mechanism:**
This error is driven by a visual heuristic: the student sees the $10$ on one side and the $5$ on the other and performs the calculation $10 \div 5$. They fail to recognize that in the structure $a = \frac{b}{x}$, the variable is the **divisor**, not the quotient. This leads them to pick **Option C ($p=2$)**, which is a "high-distractor" because it represents the result of the calculation they *wish* they were doing ($10 \div 5$), rather than the calculation required ($5 \div 10$). 

This is particularly difficult because students are conditioned to think "big number divided by small number," making the correct decimal answer ($0.5$) feel counter-intuitive.
