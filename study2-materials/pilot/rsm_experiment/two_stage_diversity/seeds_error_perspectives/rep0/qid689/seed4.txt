As a researcher in mathematics education, I would identify the **"Commutative Misconception of Division"** as a specific reason students often select **Option C ($p=2$)**.

**The Specific Obstacle:**
Many students possess a subconscious "Large $\div$ Small" heuristic, where they instinctively divide the larger number by the smaller number regardless of their positions in the equation. When a student sees the integers $10$ and $5$, they recognize a "number fact" family ($10, 5, 2$).

**The Mechanics of the Error:**
1.  The student attempts to "undo" the fraction to isolate $p$.
2.  Rather than performing the reciprocal operation (multiplying by $p$), they mentally treat the relationship between $10$ and $5$ as the primary focus.
3.  Because $10 \div 5 = 2$ is a fluently retrieved multiplication fact, the student concludes $p=2$, effectively solving the equation $p = 10 \div 5$ instead of $p = 5 \div 10$.

**Why this is a "Notational Trap":**
The vertical structure of the fraction $\frac{5}{p}$ can visually obscure the fact that $5$ is the dividend and $p$ is the divisor. For a novice, the $10$ on the left-hand side carries more "weight," leading them to incorrectly reorder the operation as $10/5$ to reach a whole-number result. This is a common manifestation of **"Division yields a smaller result"** bias, where students find $0.5$ counter-intuitive as a solution because they expect the result of "working with 10 and 5" to be a larger, more "standard" integer like 2 or 50.
