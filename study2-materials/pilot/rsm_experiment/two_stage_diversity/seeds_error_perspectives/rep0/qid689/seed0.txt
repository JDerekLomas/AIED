One specific reason why students frequently find this question difficult is the **"larger divided by smaller" heuristic**, which leads them to select **Option C ($p=2$)**.

In many introductory division and algebra problems, the dividend is larger than the divisor. When students encounter the numbers $10$ and $5$, they intuitively look for a relationship between them. Instead of algebraically manipulating the equation by multiplying by $p$, they perform a "quick-look" mental calculation: **$10 \div 5 = 2$**.

This error occurs because the student mistakes the *value* of the answer for the *value* of the variable. They treat the problem as if it were $p = 10 \div 5$ (which fits a familiar numerical pattern) rather than recognizing that $p$ is the denominator, requiring the calculation $p = 5 \div 10$. This visual and cognitive shortcut bypasses the reciprocal nature of the equation, making the intuitive but mathematically incorrect answer (C) highly attractive.
