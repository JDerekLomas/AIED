One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "left-to-right" placement trap**, which leads to a common confusion between the **dividend** and the **divisor** when translating to a fraction bar (Option D).

### The Specific Difficulty:
In the horizontal expression $c \div (h+4)$, the term $(h+4)$ appears physically larger and more complex because it contains two characters and an operator. Students frequently possess a misconception that the "larger" or "more complex" part of a division problem should serve as the "base" or "house" for the calculation.

When translating to the vertical fraction notation:
*   Students correctly identify that the division sign becomes the fraction bar.
*   However, they often succumb to a **spatial reversal**. Because they are accustomed to reading left-to-right, but have not yet solidified the rule that "left equals numerator" and "right equals denominator," they may subconsciously prioritize the $(h+4)$ as the more dominant term and place it on the top (Option D). 

This is especially common if students have recently practiced "clearing denominators" in equations, where the $(h+4)$ would be the term they are focusing on moving, or if they erroneously associate the first term ($c$) with the "result" they are looking for rather than the quantity being divided.
