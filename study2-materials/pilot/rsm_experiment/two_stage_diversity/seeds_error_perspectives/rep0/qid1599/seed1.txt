One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual trap of the grouping structure (Option C)**, which stems from a literal, left-to-right decoding of the symbols.

Students are often taught that a vinculum (fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol. However, when transitioning from the linear horizontal notation $c \div (h+4)$ to the vertical fraction notation, many students fail to recognize that the division bar must extend underneath the entire $h+4$ expression to maintain the grouping indicated by the parentheses. 

In **Option C**, the student may visually process "divide by $h$" first, resulting in $\frac{c}{h}$, and then simply "append" the $+4$ at the end because they are following the sequence of characters in the original expression from left to right. This error is compounded if the student has a fragile understanding of the **order of operations**; they may perceive the parentheses as a temporary instruction to be "discarded" once the fraction bar is introduced, rather than seeing the entire $(h+4)$ as a single "package" or denominator.
