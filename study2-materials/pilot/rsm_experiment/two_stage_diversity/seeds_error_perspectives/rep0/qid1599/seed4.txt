One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "left-to-right" placement trap**, which leads to a common confusion between the **dividend** and the **divisor**.

In many students’ mental models of division, there is a literal spatial translation: the thing written first goes on top, and the thing written second goes on the bottom. However, because fractions are often introduced using "top-heavy" improper fractions or simple ratios where the larger or "more complex" term is on the bottom, students may experience a cognitive conflict when seeing the single variable \( c \) paired with a multi-term expression like \( (h+4) \).

This leads to a specific error in selecting **Option D**:

*   **The Trap:** Students may perceive the expression \( h+4 \) as "heavier" or more "dominant" because it contains both a variable and a constant.
*   **The Error:** Even if they understand that division should be expressed as a fraction, they may instinctively place the more complex expression (\( h+4 \)) in the numerator to "balance" the fraction visually, or because they have misidentified the divisor in a non-standard orientation.

Furthermore, students who struggle with **brackets/grouping** often fall for **Option C**. They see the \( c \div h \) first and convert it to \( \frac{c}{h} \), but then treat the \( +4 \) as a separate "dangling" term because they do not realize that the division operation in the original horizontal notation applies to the *entire* grouped sum within the parentheses.
