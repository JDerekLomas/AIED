One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **visual "bracket-stripping" trap** inherent in option C, which exploits a common error in understanding the **scope of the fraction bar**.

In algebra, the fraction bar (vinculum) acts as a grouping symbol, performing the same function as the parentheses in $c \div (h + 4)$. Students who have not fully internalized this property often rely on a "left-to-right" transcription strategy. When they see $c \div h + 4$, their eyes perceive the $c \div h$ as the primary unit. 

In option C ($\frac{c}{h} + 4$), the notation physically matches the order of the original terms if the parentheses are ignored or treated as "invisible" once the division symbol is converted. A student may see the $h$ as the immediate divisor of $c$ and view the $+4$ as a separate trailing term. This is a specific failure to recognize that the horizontal bar must extend across the entire expression $h+4$ to maintain the integrity of the original grouped divisor.
