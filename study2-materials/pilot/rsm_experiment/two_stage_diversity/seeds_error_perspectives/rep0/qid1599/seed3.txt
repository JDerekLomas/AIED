One specific reason students find this question difficult is the **visual "Grouping Trap"** involving the horizontal fraction bar.

In the original expression \(c \div (h+4)\), the brackets explicitly tell the student that $h+4$ is a single entity. However, when transitioning to algebraic fraction notation (Option A), those brackets disappear because the length of the **vinculum** (the horizontal bar) acts as an "invisible" grouping symbol.

Students frequently struggle with this transition for two opposite reasons:

1.  **Over-reliance on literal symbols:** A student might look for an answer that *retains* the parentheses. When they don’t see \( \frac{c}{(h+4)} \), they may conclude that the notation must change in a more radical way, leading them to pick **Option C**, mistakenly thinking the division only applies to the $h$.
2.  **Order of Operations confusion:** Students often read left-to-right. In Option **D**, the $h+4$ appears first/on top, which can trick a student who subconsciously matches the "lengthier" part of the expression to the numerator, or who fails to recognize that the term *following* the division sign must become the denominator.

**In short:** The difficulty lies in recognizing that the fraction bar replaces the need for brackets, a notation shift that contradicts the student's earlier training that "grouping always requires parentheses."
