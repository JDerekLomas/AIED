One specific reason students may find this question difficult is a **notational trap involving the "coefficient-variable relationship."**

Specifically, many students struggle when the equation is presented in **standard form ($Ax + By = C$)** rather than **slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$)**. When a student sees $4x + 2y = 10$ and substitutes $x = 0$, they are left with the simplified equation:

$$2y = 10$$

The common error occurs at this "one-step equation" stage. Because the student is accustomed to solving for $y$ by isolating it, but is used to seeing $x$ as the primary input, they may instinctively perform the operation associated with the first term they saw. 

**The specific trap:** A student might observe the $4x$ and $2y$ and conclude they need to subtract $4$ or divide by $4$ instead of $2$. However, the most likely specific error here leads to **Distractor C (5)** being chosen correctly for the wrong reason or via an incomplete process:

*   **The Zero-Term Trap:** Because $x=0$, the term $4(0)$ disappears. Some students mentally "delete" the $x$ portion but then fail to perform the final division. If the question had been $x + 2y = 10$, a student might simply see the $10$ and the $2$ and pick **C** via simple division. 
*   Conversely, if the student erroneously thinks the "star" represents the **y-intercept** of a function in the form $y=mx+b$, they may look at the equation $4x + 2y = 10$, see the constant **10**, and look for a way to relate it to the 4 or the 2, potentially leading them to **D (2.5)** (by doing $10 \div 4$) because they have been conditioned that the $x$-coefficient is the "divisor" or the "rate."

In short: the difficulty lies in the **standard form layout**, which requires an extra step of algebraic isolation (dividing by the coefficient of $y$) that is not necessary when a table is generated from a $y = \dots$ equation.
