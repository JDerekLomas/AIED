One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **visual/notational trap** involving the confusion between **substitution** and **coefficient isolation**.

Specifically, many students treat the equation $4x + 2y = 10$ as a prompt to solve for a single variable's coefficient or intercept immediately, rather than processing the relationship between the two variables. This leads to two common errors rooted in the structure of the numbers:

1.  **The "Isolation Error" (Leading to C):** Students often see the $2$ next to the $y$ and the $10$ on the right side. When they substitute $x=0$, they mentally "delete" the $4x$ term. Instead of solving the remaining $2y = 10$, they may intuitively perform the division $10 \div 2$ correctly but mistake the goal, or conversely, look only at the constants $x=0$ and the result $10$, seeing $10/2$ as the only "math" to do.
2.  **The "Coefficient Reflex" (Leading to C or D):** In early linear algebra, students are conditioned to look for intercepts. If a student confuses the $x$ and $y$ intercepts, they might perform $10 \div 4 = 2.5$ (Option D), solving for $x$ when $y=0$, rather than $y$ when $x=0$. 

The presence of **Option C (5)** is a "high-attractor" because $10$ and $2$ are numbers with a strong multiplicative bond. A student who correctly identifies that $x=0$ simplifies the equation to $2y=10$ still faces a hurdles: if they are used to equations in the form $y = mx + c$, the standard form ($Ax + By = C$) feels "backwards," making them more likely to lapse into simple arithmetic $(10 \div 2)$ without fully mapping the logic of the table.
