One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is a **visual/notational trap** related to the horizontal layout of the table, specifically the tendency to **incorrectly associate the star with the $x$-row rather than the $y$-row.**

In many early algebra problems, $x$ is the "starting" variable, and tables are often oriented vertically with $x$ on the left and $y$ on the right. In this horizontal table, the star is placed in the row labeled "$y$," directly beneath the $x$-value of $0$. However, students who struggle with "algebraic decoding" often skim the table and see the star as the very first entry of the bottom row. 

Because $0$ is the very first entry of the top row, these students often perform a **"First Number Substitution" error**: 
They instinctively replace the $y$ in the equation $4x + 2y = 10$ with $0$ (the first $x$-value) and solve for the unknown $x$ instead of vice versa. 

**How this trap manifests:**
*   If a student thinks the star means "What is $x$ when $y = 0$?", they set up $4x + 2(0) = 10$.
*   This simplifies to $4x = 10$.
*   Dividing $10$ by $4$ gives **$2.5$**. 
*   Because $2.5$ is provided as **Option D**, the student receives "false validation" for their procedural mistake, making them unlikely to check the orientation of the table or their substitution logic.
