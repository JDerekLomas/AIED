One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **atypical placement of the unknown within the structure of the linear equation** (the "Visual/Notational Trap" of the standard form $Ax + By = C$).

Specifically, most early algebra curriculum focuses on functions presented in "explicit form" ($y = mx + b$). Students are conditioned to treat the $y$ variable as the "output" that is already isolated. In this problem, because the $y$ is embedded within the expression $4x + 2y = 10$, students often fall into the **"Value Replacement Error."**

Instead of performing the necessary two-step algebraic manipulation (substituting $x=0$ to get $2y=10$ and then dividing by $2$), a significant number of students will mentally map the $x=0$ to the entire left side of the equation. Because $4(0)$ is $0$, they see the remaining $10$ on the right side and conclude that $y$ must be $10$. 

This makes **Distractor C (5)** and **Distractor A (20)** particularly powerful:
*   **C (5)** is the correct result of the two-step process ($10 \div 2$).
*   If a student lacks the "algebraic fluency" to divide by the coefficient of $y$, they may simply see the $0$ and the $10$ and look for a way to relate them to the coefficients, potentially choosing **A (20)** by multiplying the constant $10$ by the coefficient $2$, or simply guessing because the $y$ isn't "alone."

The difficulty lies in the fact that the table format suggests a simple "plug and play" pattern, but the **Standard Form equation** requires an extra step of inverse operations that $y = mx + b$ equations do not.
