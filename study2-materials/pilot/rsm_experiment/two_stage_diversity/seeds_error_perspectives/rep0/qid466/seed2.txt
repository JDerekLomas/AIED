A primary reason students find this question difficult is a **misapplication of the "additive inverse" rule (changing the sign) when they should be applying the "multiplicative inverse" rule (reciprocals).**

Specifically, students often go wrong by over-generalizing the process of solving for a missing value to produce a target number (in this case, 1 or -1). Because students are frequently drilled on the idea that "to get to zero, you change the sign" and "to cancel a fraction, you flip it," they often combine these two distinct rules.

In this specific problem, a student might correctly identify that the reciprocal ($\frac{4}{3}$) is needed to turn the fraction into a 1, but then erroneously conclude that they must also **change the sign** to "cancel out" the negative on the left side. This lead them to select **Option B ($-\frac{4}{3}$)**. 

They incorrectly apply the logic of:
1. "It's negative, so I need a negative to get back to 1."
2. "But I have to 'do the opposite' to solve it."

This confusion results in an answer of $-1 \times - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{16}$ or $-\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{4}{3} = 1$, failing to notice that the target is **$-1$**. The presence of the negative sign in the target value ($ -1$) acts as a "notational trap" that makes them forget that a negative multiplied by a **positive** stays negative.
