A primary reason students find this question difficult is a **"Sign-Density Conflict"** involving the negative product.

Specifically, students frequently fixate on the fact that the answer is negative ($-1$) and mistakenly conclude that the missing number must also be negative. Their internal logic often follows a "Matching Rule": *If the result is negative, the terms involved should look negative.*

This leads to the specific error of selecting **Option B ($-4/3$)**. The student successfully identifies the need for a reciprocal ($4/3$) to achieve the absolute value of 1, but they "over-apply" the negative sign. They fail to apply the multiplicative rule that **(Negative) × (Positive) = Negative**, instead defaulting to the intuitive but incorrect heuristic that "Negative times negative stays negative" or simply wanting the signs in the equation to appear consistent.

This makes Option B a highly effective "distractor" because it rewards the correct algebraic step (inverting the fraction) while punishing a surface-level misunderstanding of integer sign rules.
