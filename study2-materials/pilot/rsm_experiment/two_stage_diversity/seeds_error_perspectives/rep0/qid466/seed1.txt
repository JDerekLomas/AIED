One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **misapplication of the "additive inverse" (opposite) rule when seeking the "multiplicative inverse" (reciprocal).**

Students are frequently taught that to "undo" a negative number, you make it positive. In this specific problem, a student may correctly identify that the fraction must be flipped ($4/3$), but then incorrectly apply the rule for **addition** (where $-\frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = 0$) to this **multiplication** context. 

This leads to a specific sign error:
*   The student knows that the product must be negative ($1$ is negative in the equation).
*   They see a negative sign already exists in the first term ($-\frac{3}{4}$).
*   They recall the "opposite" rule and assume they need the positive version of the reciprocal to keep the result negative (forgetting that a **negative $\times$ positive = negative**).
*   Alternatively, they may over-generalize the "Two negatives make a positive" rule and choose **Option A ($4/3$)** because they believe they must avoid having two negatives to keep the answer negative.

In this context, the visual presence of the negative sign in the product ($-1$) often acts as a distractor that triggers "sign-changing" behavior rather than the "sign-preserving" behavior required for a positive identity.
