One specific reason why students might find this question difficult is the **misapplication of the "additive inverse" (negative) sign**.

In many introductory algebra problems involving fractions, students are taught to find the value of "1" through addition—for example, $-\frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = 0$, where they change the sign to reach a target of zero. When confronted with this multiplication problem, students often correctly identify the need for the **reciprocal** (flipping the fraction to $\frac{4}{3}$) but mistakenly apply the logic of the **additive inverse** by changing the sign to a positive.

Consequently, students frequently choose **Option A ($\frac{4}{3}$)** because they believe the negative sign must be "cancelled out" by its opposite (a positive) to resolve the equation, rather than recognizing that a negative times a positive results in a negative product. This error is driven by a linguistic and conceptual confusion between the **opposite** (sign change) and the **reciprocal** (fraction flip).
