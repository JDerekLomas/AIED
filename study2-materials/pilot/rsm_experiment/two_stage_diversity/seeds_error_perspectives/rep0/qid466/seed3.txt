A primary reason students find this question difficult is a **confusion between the concepts of "Reciprocal" and "Additive Inverse,"** specifically concerning how to handle the negative sign.

In this problem, a student must find the multiplicative inverse (reciprocal) of $-\frac{3}{4}$ to result in a positive 1, then apply the negative sign to ensure the final product is $-1$ (or simply recognize that the product of a negative and a positive is a negative). However, a very common error occurs during the "flipping" process:

**The Trap of "Changing the Sign while Flipping":**
Many students learn the "Negative Reciprocal" rule when studying perpendicular gradients in geometry. When they see a fraction that needs to be "inverted" to reach a target of 1 or -1, they often perform two transformations automatically:
1.  **The Flip:** $\frac{3}{4}$ becomes $\frac{4}{3}$.
2.  **The Sign Switch:** $-$ becomes $+$.

Because students often associate "the opposite" (the reciprocal) with "the other sign," they are highly likely to select **Option A ($4/3$)**. They correctly identify that they need to flip the fraction to cancel the $3/4$, but they incorrectly assume that because the first number is negative, the second must be positive to "balance" or "cancel out" the negativity. 

This error is exacerbated by the target being $-1$ rather than $1$; the student perceives that since the negative sign is already present in the answer, they don't "need" another one in the $\star$, leading them to overlook the rule that $(\text{negative}) \times (\text{positive}) = (\text{negative})$.
