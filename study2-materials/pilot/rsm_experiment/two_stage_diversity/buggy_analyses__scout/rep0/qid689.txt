To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given equation $10 = \frac{5}{p}$, let's analyze the misconceptions and typical student responses as outlined in the perspectives provided.

### Understanding the Misconceptions

- **Perspective 1 & 2:** The "Position-Independent Inverse" Bug and "Operation Inversion Priority" lead to $p = 50$ (Option B). This is because students incorrectly apply the inverse operation without considering the variable's position.
- **Perspective 3 & 4 & 5:** "Operation Over Generalisation," "The Inverse Operation Position Bias," and "Operation Switching via Commutative Illusion" lead to $p = 2$ (Option C). Students here divide the larger number by the smaller, ignoring the algebraic structure.

### Ability Levels and Predicted Responses

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulations. They are more likely to guess or apply simple arithmetic operations without fully solving the equation.
  - **A = 10%** (some might stumble upon the correct method or have a basic understanding)
  - **B = 40%** (application of simple multiplication, as in Perspective 1 & 2)
  - **C = 30%** (simple division of numbers seen, as in Perspectives 3, 4, & 5)
  - **D = 20%** (completely unsure or incorrect understanding of equations)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but often fall into common misconceptions.
  - **A = 20%** (starting to understand inverse operations but might not apply correctly)
  - **B = 45%** (common misconception as in Perspectives 1 & 2)
  - **C = 25%** (misconceptions as in Perspectives 3, 4, & 5)
  - **D = 10%** (beginning to realize limitations of their methods)

- **Proficient:** These students understand the basics of algebra but might still be prone to some misconceptions.
  - **A = 60%** (correct understanding or quickly figuring out the correct method)
  - **B = 20%** (some still fall into the misconception)
  - **C = 15%** (less likely to fall into these specific traps)
  - **D = 5%** (awareness of equation constraints)

- **Advanced:** Advanced students are less likely to make these errors and more likely to solve the equation using correct algebraic methods.
  - **A = 80%** (clear understanding and application)
  - **B = 5%** (rarely fall into such misconceptions)
  - **C = 5%** (exceptionally resistant to these errors)
  - **D = 10%** (aware of when equations may not have solutions but understand this specific case)

### Response in Required Format

Given these analyses:

```
