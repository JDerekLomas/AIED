Below is the analysis based on the provided perspectives, predicting the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

### below_basic:
- **A (0.81):** 60% (Many students with this misconception will incorrectly prioritize multiplication over exponentiation, leading them to choose A)
- **B (0.27):** 15% (Students who have some understanding but struggle with decimals might arrive here, possibly through correct calculation but more likely through guessing)
- **C (1.8):** 10% (Unlikely, as this would require a different type of mistake, like adding or an incorrect operation)
- **D (2.7):** 15% (Some might incorrectly calculate or misinterpret the squaring and multiplication steps)

### basic:
- **A (0.81):** 40% (A significant portion still struggling with BIDMAS or misinterpreting the operations)
- **B (0.27):** 30% (Students beginning to grasp the correct order of operations and decimal calculations might get here)
- **C (1.8):** 15% (Some errors in calculation or misunderstanding of operations)
- **D (2.7):** 15% (Linear scaling errors or miscalculations)

### proficient:
- **A (0.81):** 20% (Even proficient students might fall into the trap of the linear reading or incorrect grouping)
- **B (0.27):** 60% (Most should calculate correctly: $3 \times 0.3^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$)
- **C (1.8):** 10% (Rare calculation errors)
- **D (2.7):** 10% (Misapplication of rules or careless errors)

### advanced:
- **A (0.81):** 5% (Very few would make this mistake, but occasionally, even strong students might misread or miscalculate under pressure)
- **B (0.27):** 90% (Correct calculation: $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$)
- **C (1.8):** 3% (Very rare errors)
- **D (2.7):** 2% (Likely due to a significant miscalculation or misunderstanding)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
