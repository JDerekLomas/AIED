## Step 1: Analyzing the Question and Common Misconceptions
The question involves solving a linear equation and evaluating the correctness of given steps. The equation is \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\). The steps provided are:
- Step 1: \(60 = 1 + k\)
- Step 2: \(61 = k\)

## 2: Correct Solution for Comparison
To solve the equation correctly:
1. Multiply both sides by 4: \(15 \times 4 = 1 + k\), which gives \(60 = 1 + k\).
2. Subtract 1 from both sides: \(60 - 1 = k\), which gives \(59 = k\).

## 3: Evaluating Isaac's Steps
- Step 1 is correct because multiplying both sides by 4 yields \(60 = 1 + k\).
- Step 2 is incorrect because it incorrectly states \(61 = k\) instead of \(59 = k\).

## 4: Understanding Student Misconceptions
Based on the perspectives provided, common misconceptions include:
- The "Change the Side, Change the Sign" confusion, where students incorrectly apply inverse operations.
- The "Moving means Adding" error, where students add instead of applying the correct inverse operation.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
Given these misconceptions and the typical understanding of algebra at the Year 9 level:
- Students who correctly understand algebra will choose **A) Only step 1**.
- Students with the "add when moving" misconception will choose **C) Both steps are correct**.

## 6: Ability Level Considerations
- **Below Basic**: These students may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and are more likely to choose **C) Both steps are correct** due to a lack of understanding of inverse operations.
- **Basic**: Students at this level may understand the concept of inverse operations but struggle with application, potentially choosing **A) Only step 1** or **C) Both steps are correct** based on their grasp of the material.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to choose **A) Only step 1** as they understand the correctness of Step 1 and the error in Step 2.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will also choose **A) Only step 1**, as they have a strong understanding of algebraic principles and can easily identify the mistake in Step 2.

## 7: Estimating Percentages
Given the common misconceptions and understanding of algebra:
- **Below Basic**: A=30%, B=10%, C=50%, D=10%
- **Basic**: A=50%, B=20%, C=25%, D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=70%, B=10%, C=15%, D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=90%, B=5%, C=5%, D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=50% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=5% D=0%
