Based on the analysis of common misconceptions and errors that Year 9 students might make when solving this problem, here's a predicted breakdown of the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

```
below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=40% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
```

Here's a brief explanation for each ability level:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level are more likely to make significant errors. They might not fully understand the substitution process or how to solve for the variable. As a result, they could be evenly distributed across the options, with a slight inclination towards options that seem to match their miscalculations (A, B, and D).

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but are prone to making mistakes in calculations or in applying the correct operations. They're more likely to choose options based on common misconceptions, such as the Variable Swap Bug or Sign Errors. Option C, being the correct answer, starts to become more appealing as they grasp the basic concepts, but errors still lead to distributions across other options.

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid understanding of algebraic manipulations and are less likely to fall into common traps. They would mostly choose the correct option, C, but a small percentage might still make careless mistakes or fall into misconceptions leading to other options.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of the concepts and are highly unlikely to make the common mistakes analyzed. Therefore, they would predominantly choose the correct answer, C, with very few opting for incorrect options.

This breakdown reflects the gradual improvement in understanding and accuracy as students progress from below basic to advanced levels.
