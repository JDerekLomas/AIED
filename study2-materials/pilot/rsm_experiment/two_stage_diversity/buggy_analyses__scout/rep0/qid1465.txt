## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Perspectives
The question requires predicting the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for the expression $3-5+4 \times 2$. The correct answer, following the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), is Option A: $6$.

## 2: Analyzing the Misconceptions
- **Strict Priority of Addition over Subtraction (A before S)**: This leads to Option D: $-10$.
- **Strict Left-to-Right Processing (ignoring BIDMAS)**: This leads to Option B: $4$.
- Other options might arise from calculation errors or different misconceptions.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand BIDMAS or might make simple arithmetic errors. They are more likely to choose options based on incorrect calculations or a lack of understanding of the order of operations.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still fall into common traps like the "A before S" misconception or strict left-to-right processing.
- **Proficient**: These students understand BIDMAS but might still make occasional errors under pressure or due to distractions.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are likely to have a solid grasp of BIDMAS and perform calculations accurately.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given the common misconceptions:
- Option A (correct) is likely to be chosen by a higher percentage of advanced and proficient students.
- Option D (due to "A before S" misconception) could be a common incorrect choice, especially among basic and below_basic students.
- Option B (strict left-to-right) might also be chosen by a significant number, especially among those not fully grasping BIDMAS.
- Option C seems less likely as it would require a specific and less common error.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Without specific data, assigning exact percentages requires estimation based on typical student performance and common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic**: A=20%, B=30%, C=10%, D=40%
- **Basic**: A=40%, B=25%, C=5%, D=30%
- **Proficient**: A=70%, B=15%, C=5%, D=10%
- **Advanced**: A=90%, B=5%, C=0%, D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
