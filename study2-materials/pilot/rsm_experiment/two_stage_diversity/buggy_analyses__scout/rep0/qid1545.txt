## Step 1: Analyze the perspectives on common student misconceptions
The perspectives provided detail a common misconception among Year 9 students regarding the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students often ignore BIDMAS and instead process mathematical expressions from left to right.

## 2: Understand the specific misconception and its impact
The specific misconception discussed is the "Left-to-Right" linear processing bug, where students treat mathematical expressions as sentences in English, performing operations strictly from left to right. This leads them to incorrectly solve expressions like $8 + 12 \div 4$ and $(8 + 12) \div 4$ as equal.

## 3: Consider how students with this misconception approach the problem
Students with this misconception would calculate $8 + 12 \div 4$ as $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$. For $(8 + 12) \div 4$, they would calculate $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$. Both sides equal 5, leading them to choose option C) $=$.

## 4: Assess the attractiveness of the error
The error is highly attractive because it produces a "clean" result on both sides, yields the same integer for both expressions, and reinforces a false sense of security in the student's method.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option
- **Below Basic:** Students struggling with basic arithmetic and order of operations might be more likely to make errors. Given the simplicity of the question and the commonality of the misconception, a significant portion might choose C) $=$ due to the left-to-right error. Let's assume A=20%, B=10%, C=60%, D=10%.
- **Basic:** Students at a basic level might still fall into the trap of the left-to-right misconception but have a slightly better understanding of operations. Thus, they might also lean towards C) $=$. Let's assume A=40%, B=15%, C=40%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are more likely to understand BIDMAS and correctly calculate $8 + 12 \div 4 = 11$ and $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 5$, leading them to choose A) $>$. Let's assume A=70%, B=10%, C=15%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students would likely have a strong grasp of BIDMAS and easily identify the correct relationship, choosing A) $>$. Let's assume A=90%, B=5%, C=5%, D=0%.

## 6: Conclude the predicted percentages
Based on the analysis:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=5% D=0%
