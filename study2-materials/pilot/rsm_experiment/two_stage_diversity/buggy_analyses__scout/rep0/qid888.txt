## Step 1: Analyzing the Question and Common Misconceptions
The question requires expanding the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\) using the FOIL method or a similar approach. Common misconceptions include handling the signs of the numbers when multiplying, particularly when both numbers are negative.

## 2: Understanding the Options
- Option A: \(m^{2}-2 m-35\)
- Option B: \(m^{2}-12 m+35\)
- Option C: \(m^{2}+12 m+35\)
- Option D: \(m^{2}-12 m-35\)

## 3: Identifying the Correct Answer
The correct expansion of \((m-5)(m-7)\) is:
\[m \times m = m^2\]
\[m \times -7 = -7m\]
\[-5 \times m = -5m\]
\[-5 \times -7 = 35\]
So, combining these:
\[m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\]
Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
### below_basic
At this level, students may struggle significantly with the algebra and sign rules:
- A: Likely to be chosen by students who miscalculate the middle term significantly (e.g., \(m^2 - 2m\)) or have no concept of the correct expansion.
- B: Unlikely, as these students might not reach the correct combination of terms.
- C: Possible for students who incorrectly add the \(m\) terms and the constants.
- D: Highly attractive due to the misconception that two negatives make a negative.

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding but make significant errors:
- A: May choose this if they misunderstand the FOIL method significantly.
- B: Still challenging but possible for those close to understanding.
- C: Possible for those confusing addition and multiplication of negatives.
- D: Highly attractive for similar reasons as below_basic.

### proficient
These students understand the FOIL method but may still make careless errors:
- A: Unlikely, as they know the basic structure.
- B: Correct answer; likely to be chosen by those confident in their algebra.
- C: Unlikely but possible for those rushing.
- D: Attractive due to the error in handling the negative \(\times\) negative.

### advanced
Students at this level are confident and less prone to errors:
- A: Unlikely.
- B: Highly likely, as they understand the FOIL method and sign rules.
- C: Very unlikely.
- D: Less likely due to a solid understanding of sign rules.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
- **below_basic:** A=30% (common errors in calculation), B=10% (struggle with correct signs and terms), C=20% (confusion with signs), D=40% (attractive error).
- **basic:** A=15%, B=30% (as they get closer to understanding), C=10%, D=45%.
- **proficient:** A=5%, B=70%, C=5%, D=20%.
- **advanced:** A=0%, B=90%, C=0%, D=10%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
