## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
The question requires an understanding of common mathematical misconceptions, particularly the "Linear Evaluation" or "Left-to-Right Processing" bug, where students ignore the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and calculate expressions from left to right.

## 2: Analyzing the Question
The given question is \(8+12 \div 4 \square(8+12) \div 4\). To solve it correctly, one must apply BIDMAS/BODMAS: for the left side, \(12 \div 4 = 3\), then \(8 + 3 = 11\); for the right side, \((8 + 12) = 20\), then \(20 \div 4 = 5\). Thus, \(11 > 5\), making the correct answer \(A) > \).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students with significant gaps in understanding or application of Order of Operations are likely to fall into the trap of Left-to-Right Processing. They will calculate both sides as equal (getting \(5 = 5\)), leading them to choose \(C) =\).
- **Basic**: Students at this level may start to recognize the importance of Order of Operations but might still be prone to errors. A portion will correctly solve the problem, but a significant number will still choose \(C) =\) due to the Left-to-Right bug.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students are more likely to understand and apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly but might still make careless mistakes. The majority should choose \(A) >\), but some could mistakenly choose \(C) =\).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are expected to have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, including the Order of Operations. They are likely to choose \(A) >\).

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given the nature of the misconceptions and the typical understanding at each level:
- **Below Basic**: \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 65\%\), \(D = 5\%\)
- **Basic**: \(A = 40\%\), \(B = 15\%\), \(C = 40\%\), \(D = 5\%\)
- **Proficient**: \(A = 70\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(D = 5\%\)
- **Advanced**: \(A = 90\%\), \(B = 0\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 5\%\)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=65% D=5%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
