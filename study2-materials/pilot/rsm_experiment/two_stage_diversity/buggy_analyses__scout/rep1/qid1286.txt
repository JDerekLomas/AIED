## Step 1: Analyzing the Question and Options
The question requires students to rearrange the formula for the volume of a sphere, \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), to solve for the radius \(r\). The correct solution involves isolating \(r\) by first dividing both sides by \(\frac{4}{3}\pi\), then taking the cube root of both sides.

## Step 2: Understanding Common Misconceptions
Several misconceptions are identified, including:
- "Multiplicative Inversion Displacement" or incorrectly manipulating fractions during inversion of a formula.
- "Reciprocal Misplacement in Division" or the 'Multiply by the Numerator' bug, where students incorrectly apply operations to the numerator and denominator of a fraction when moving it across the equals sign.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may not fully understand algebraic manipulation or may apply incorrect operations. They are likely to choose an option that resembles the original formula or seems intuitively correct but is incorrect. Option A seems attractive due to its familiarity and correct components.

- **Basic:** Students here may recognize the need to isolate \(r\) but might apply incorrect algebraic steps. They could be swayed by visual similarities to the original formula, potentially selecting Option A.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the algebraic process but might still fall into common traps. They are less likely to choose Option A and more likely to select the correct option or another that seems plausible based on their understanding.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students are more likely to correctly solve for \(r\), selecting Option C, \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\), as it correctly represents the rearranged formula.

## 4: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=60% (due to the attractive error), B=20%, C=10%, D=10%
- **Basic:** A=40%, B=30% (common mistake), C=20%, D=10%
- **Proficient:** A=20%, B=30%, C=40% (correct understanding), D=10%
- **Advanced:** A=5%, B=5%, C=80% (correct solution), D=10%

## 5: Finalizing the Response
The final percentages based on the predicted student responses are:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
