Based on the common misconceptions and the typical performance of Year 9 students in the UK, here's a predicted breakdown of the percentages for each ability level:

below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=45% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%

Here's a brief explanation for each ability level:

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level are more likely to have a limited understanding of algebraic fractions. They may not fully grasp the concept of finding a common denominator. As a result, they are more prone to errors such as adding the numerators and denominators separately, which leads to **Option B (60%)**. A smaller percentage may choose **Option A (20%)**, having partially understood the concept of a common denominator but not applying it fully. Others might choose **Options C (10%)** or **D (10%)** due to a lack of understanding or random guessing.
*   **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebraic fractions but may still struggle with applying the rules consistently. They are likely to choose **Option A (40%)**, having a better grasp of finding a common denominator. However, some may still fall into the trap of adding numerators and denominators, leading to **Option B (45%)**. A few might choose **Option D (10%)**, and a small percentage might opt for **Option C (5%)**.
*   **Proficient:** Students at this level have a solid understanding of algebraic fractions and can apply the rules to simplify expressions. They are likely to choose **Option A (70%)**, as they can correctly find a common denominator and add the fractions. Some might still choose **Option B (20%)**, possibly due to a lapse in concentration or a lingering misconception. A small percentage might choose **Options C (5%)** or **D (5%)**, likely due to careless errors.
*   **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of algebraic fractions and can simplify complex expressions with ease. They are most likely to choose **Option A (90%)**, as they can accurately apply the rules and simplify the expression. A very small percentage might choose **Option B (5%)**, possibly due to a rare mistake or a different approach. It's unlikely that they would choose **Options C (0%)** or **D (5%)**, as they have a strong foundation in algebraic fractions.
