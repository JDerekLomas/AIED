Considering the various perspectives on the misconceptions that Year 9 students might have when approaching this question, here's a prediction of the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

### below_basic:
- **A=15%** (Some very basic understanding that \( k \) needs to be substituted, but not fully grasping the power operation or the effect of a negative base.)
- **B=5%** (Unlikely, as this involves an additional incorrect operation not commonly associated with basic errors in this context.)
- **C=70%** (Highly attracted to the error of treating \(-3^4\) as \(-(3^4)\) due to calculator reinforcement and misunderstanding of order of operations.)
- **D=10%** (Basic error, possibly confusing power with multiplication.)

### basic:
- **A=40%** (Starting to understand the power operation but might struggle with negative bases; some might recognize the need for a positive outcome with an even power.)
- **B=5%** (Still a low chance of this incorrect operation.)
- **C=50%** (The "calculator logic" and order of operations misconception remains attractive.)
- **D=5%** (Less likely as basic understanding of power operations improves.)

### proficient:
- **A=70%** (Good understanding that an even power of a negative number is positive; recognizes \( (-3)^4 = 81 \).)
- **B=5%** (Minimal chance of confusing with multiplication.)
- **C=20%** (Some might still fall into the trap of "indices before negation" but are less likely to.)
- **D=5%** (Unlikely, as proficient students understand the difference between power and multiplication.)

### advanced:
- **A=90%** (Strong understanding and application of rules regarding negative bases and even powers.)
- **B=0%** (Unlikely to confuse with multiplication or other operations.)
- **C=5%** (Extremely few would still make the mistake, mostly due to careless error.)
- **D=5%** (Similarly unlikely, reflecting a high level of precision in applying mathematical rules.)

Given these perspectives, the response in the exact format requested is:

below_basic: A=15% B=5% C=70% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=5% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
