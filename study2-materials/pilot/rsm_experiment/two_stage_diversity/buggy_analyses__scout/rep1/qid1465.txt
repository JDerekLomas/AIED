## Step 1: Understanding the Perspectives
The question requires predicting the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for the given mathematical expression $3-5+4 \times 2$. The expression's solution depends on understanding and applying the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

## 2: Identifying Common Misconceptions
Several misconceptions are identified:
- **Priority of Addition Over Subtraction**: Students might perform addition before subtraction due to the alphabetical order in BIDMAS.
- **Left-to-Right Processing**: Ignoring BIDMAS, students perform operations as they appear from left to right.

## 3: Analyzing Option A (Correct Answer)
Option A (6) is the correct answer, obtained by following BIDMAS: $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 = -2$, and finally $-2 + 8 = 6$. Students who understand and correctly apply BIDMAS will choose this option.

## 4: Analyzing Option B (4)
Option B (4) results from left-to-right processing: $3 - 5 = -2$, $-2 + 4 = 2$, and $2 \times 2 = 4$. This is a common misconception where students ignore the priority of multiplication.

## 5: Analyzing Option C (-12)
Option C (-12) does not directly result from the described misconceptions. It could be from a calculation error not specifically mentioned, such as $3 - 5 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$ (but incorrectly calculating $2 \times 2$ or misinterpreting the expression).

## 6: Analyzing Option D (-10)
Option D (-10) comes from prioritizing addition over subtraction due to BIDMAS: $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $5 + 8 = 13$, and finally $3 - 13 = -10$.

## 7: Predicting Student Choices by Ability Level
- **Below_Basic**: More likely to make calculation errors or not understand BIDMAS. Might choose B, C, or D due to misconceptions or errors.
- **Basic**: Starting to understand BIDMAS but might still fall into common traps like left-to-right processing (B) or addition before subtraction (D).
- **Proficient**: Better understanding of BIDMAS, so more likely to choose A (6) but could still make mistakes leading to B or D.
- **Advanced**: Highly likely to choose A, with fewer errors.

## 8: Estimating Percentages
Given the common misconceptions and assuming a distribution of understanding:
- **Below_Basic**: A=20% (some understanding but prone to errors), B=30% (left-to-right), C=10% (random errors), D=40% (misapplying BIDMAS rules).
- **Basic**: A=40%, B=35%, C=5%, D=20%.
- **Proficient**: A=70%, B=20%, C=2%, D=8%.
- **Advanced**: A=90%, B=5%, C=1%, D=4%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=35% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=70% B=20% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=1% D=4%
