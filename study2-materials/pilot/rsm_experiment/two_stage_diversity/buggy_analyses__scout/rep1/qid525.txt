Below is the predicted percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

below_basic: A=15% B=5% C=10% D=70%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=5% D=70%
proficient: A=0% B=80% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

Explanation:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level are more likely to have a weak understanding of fraction addition, leading them to rely on simple addition or incorrect rules. Hence, a high percentage (70%) are expected to choose Option D, which results from the "Component-Wise Addition" error.

- **Basic:** Students at this level have some understanding but are prone to making errors. They might still fall into the trap of the "Component-Wise Addition" error (Option D), but a noticeable percentage may start to understand the need for a common denominator, leading them towards Option B.

- **Proficient:** At this level, students have a good grasp of fraction addition and are less likely to make the "Component-Wise Addition" error. Therefore, a high percentage (80%) are expected to choose the correct answer, Option B.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong understanding and are familiar with efficiently finding common denominators and adding fractions. Therefore, almost all (95%) are expected to choose Option B, with very few opting for incorrect or less efficient methods.
