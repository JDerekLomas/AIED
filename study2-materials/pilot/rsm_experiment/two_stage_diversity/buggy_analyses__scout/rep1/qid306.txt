To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to the order of operations, specifically focusing on the BIDMAS/BODMAS mnemonic.

## Step 1: Understanding the Order of Operations
The order of operations is often taught using the BIDMAS/BODMAS mnemonic, which stands for Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. It signifies the order in which operations should be performed in a mathematical expression.

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
A common misconception among students is the strict hierarchical interpretation of BIDMAS, particularly regarding the equal priority of operations at the same level (e.g., Addition and Subtraction, Multiplication and Division). Students might believe that since 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, addition should always be performed before subtraction, regardless of their position in the expression.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- **Option A (\(4-5\); \(4+5\))**: This option reflects a purely left-to-right approach without considering the BIDMAS/BODMAS hierarchy.
- **Option B (\(4-5\); \(5 \times 6\))**: This option indicates an understanding of BIDMAS/BODMAS for multiplication but not applying it correctly for subtraction and addition.
- **Option C (\(5+6\); \(4+5\))**: This option shows a misunderstanding of the priority, particularly for Problem P.
- **Option D (\(5+6\); \(5 \times 6\))**: This option corresponds to the misconception that addition must always be done before subtraction and multiplication must be done before addition, based on their order in BIDMAS/BODMAS.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand BIDMAS/BODMAS or might apply it inconsistently. They are more likely to choose options based on a superficial understanding or guesswork. **D** might be tempting due to its adherence to a strict alphabetical order interpretation of BIDMAS/BODMAS.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic grasp of BIDMAS/BODMAS but might still struggle with equal priority operations. They might lean towards **B** as it correctly applies multiplication before addition but incorrectly handles subtraction and addition.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand BIDMAS/BODMAS and can apply it to simple expressions. They are likely to choose **B**, demonstrating an understanding of the correct priorities.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand BIDMAS/BODMAS but also the concept of equal priority for certain operations. They are likely to choose **B**, as it accurately reflects the order of operations.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis, here are estimated percentages:

- **Below Basic**: 
  - A=20% (some left-to-right without understanding), 
  - B=15% (partial understanding), 
  - C=10% (misunderstanding), 
  - D=55% (strict BIDMAS interpretation).

- **Basic**: 
  - A=10%, 
  - B=40%, 
  - C=15%, 
  - D=35%.

- **Proficient**: 
  - A=5%, 
  - B=70%, 
  - C=5%, 
  - D=20%.

- **Advanced**: 
  - A=0%, 
  - B=90%, 
  - C=0%, 
  - D=10%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
