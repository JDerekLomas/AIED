To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the common misconceptions and the likely responses based on those misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
The primary misconception identified across the perspectives is the failure to apply the inverse operation correctly, specifically in the transition from Step 1 to Step 2. Students tend to add instead of subtract when "moving" a number across the equals sign.

##  2: Analyzing Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with even the basic concepts of algebra and inverse operations. They are more likely to choose options based on simple arithmetic or no clear understanding of algebraic manipulations. Given the nature of the question, a significant portion might choose **C) Both steps are correct** due to a lack of understanding of algebraic rules, or **A) Only step 1** if they see the multiplication as correct but not understand the second step.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still struggle with applying inverse operations consistently. They might lean towards **A) Only step 1** because they understand the multiplication by 4 is correct but are unsure or incorrectly apply the subtraction in Step 2.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand algebraic manipulations but may still fall into common traps. They are likely to recognize that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect, leading them to choose **A) Only step 1**.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students have a strong grasp of algebraic concepts and are less likely to make the mistake of adding instead of subtracting. They will likely choose **A) Only step 1** because they understand the logic of Step 1 but see the error in Step 2.

## 3: Predicting Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** These students might not fully grasp the algebraic process. A high percentage might choose **C) Both steps are correct** (20-30%), with significant portions also choosing **A) Only step 1** (30-40%), and fewer choosing **D) Both steps are incorrect** (10-20%).
- **Basic:** A larger percentage will choose **A) Only step 1** (40-50%), with some choosing **C) Both steps are correct** (20-30%), and fewer for **D) (10-20%).
- **Proficient:** The majority will choose **A) Only step 1** (60-70%), with smaller percentages for **C) Both steps are correct** (10-20%) and **D) Both steps are incorrect** (10-20%).
- **Advanced:** Almost all will choose **A) Only step 1** (80-90%), with very few choosing other options.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
