Predicting the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option based on the provided perspectives:

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
The perspectives provided detail common misconceptions and errors students might make when solving the equation $3p = \frac{1}{12}$. The most prevalent misconception leads to Option A: $p = \frac{1}{4}$.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- **Option A ($p = \frac{1}{4}$)**: This is the result of incorrectly dividing the denominator by the coefficient (or misapplying cross-multiplication), a very common error.
- **Option B ($p = \frac{1}{36}$)**: This is the correct solution, achieved by properly dividing $\frac{1}{12}$ by $3$.
- **Option C ($p = 4$)**: This would result from ignoring the fraction or misinterpreting the equation entirely.
- **Option D ($p = \frac{1}{9}$)**: This doesn't directly follow from the common misconceptions described.

## 3: Ability Levels and Error Rates
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are more likely to make significant errors. They might not fully understand fraction operations or algebraic manipulation.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but are prone to simple algebraic and fraction operation mistakes.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebra and fractions but might still make occasional errors under pressure.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong understanding of algebraic concepts and are less likely to make basic errors.

## 4: Predicting Percentages
Given the nature of the question and common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic**: High likelihood of choosing an obviously incorrect option like C, and significant chance of A due to simplistic error.
- **Basic**: More likely to choose A due to the misconception of dividing the denominator by the coefficient.
- **Proficient**: Fewer errors, more likely to choose B (the correct answer) but could still fall into A.
- **Advanced**: Least likely to choose incorrect options.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Without exact data, we infer based on typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=60%, B=15%, C=20%, D=5%
- **Basic**: A=50%, B=30%, C=15%, D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=20%, B=60%, C=10%, D=10%
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=80%, C=5%, D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
