## Step 1: Understand the perspectives on common student misconceptions for the given algebra question.
The question involves a common algebra task where students need to solve $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$. Two proposed next steps are given: Tom's, which results in $\frac{x}{3} = 17$, and Katie's, which results in $x - 5 = 36$. We need to assess these based on typical student misconceptions.

## 2: Identify the correct solution steps for comparison.
To solve $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$, a correct step would involve either adding 5 to both sides (Tom's method) or multiplying every term by 3 to clear the fraction (which would correctly result in $x - 15 = 36$). Tom's step is correct: $\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5$, which simplifies to $\frac{x}{3} = 17$. Katie's step, as presented, is incorrect because it fails to multiply the $-5$ by $3$, resulting in $x - 5 = 36$ instead of the correct $x - 15 = 36$.

## 3: Analyze student misconceptions and their impact on answer choice.
The common misconception involves **Partial Multiplication** or **Denominator Neglect**, where students fail to apply an operation to all terms on one side of the equation. This leads students to believe Katie's method is correct if they think multiplying by the denominator only needs to be applied to terms directly involved with the fraction.

## 4: Estimate the distribution of student abilities and their likely responses.
- **Below Basic:** Students with significant struggles may not fully understand the algebraic manipulations, potentially leading them to choose incorrect options due to a lack of understanding of basic principles.
- **Basic:** Students at a basic level might recognize Tom's method as correct but could be swayed by Katie's if they don't fully grasp the need to distribute multiplication across all terms.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand algebraic principles and are less likely to fall for Katie's incorrect method.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to recognize both correct and incorrect algebraic manipulations easily.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option.
Given the common misconception and understanding of algebraic principles:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (understanding Tom but not fully grasping Katie's error), B=15% (thinking only Katie), C=50% (due to misconceptions), D=15%.
- **Basic:** A=60% (recognizing Tom's correctness), B=10%, C=25%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=90%, B=0%, C=5%, D=5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
