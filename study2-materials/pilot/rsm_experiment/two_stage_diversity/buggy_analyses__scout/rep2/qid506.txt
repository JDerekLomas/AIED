Considering the various perspectives provided, here's a prediction of the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

### below_basic:
- **A) \( p=\frac{1}{4} \):** 70% (Many students struggle with algebraic manipulation and are prone to errors such as "Operation Reflection" or "Division by Association," leading them to choose A.)
- **B) \( p=\frac{1}{36} \):** 15% (A few might stumble upon the correct answer or have a vague understanding that the fraction should get smaller.)
- **C) \( p=4 \):** 10% (Some might incorrectly manipulate the numbers or forget the fraction.)
- **D) \( p=\frac{1}{9} \):** 5% (Unlikely, as it involves a completely different and incorrect calculation.)

### basic:
- **A) \( p=\frac{1}{4} \):** 50% (Students at this level are familiar with basic algebraic steps but still make errors like "Inverse Operation Cross-Pollination.")
- **B) \( p=\frac{1}{36} \):** 30% (Some understand the concept of isolating \( p \) and can apply it correctly or by intuition.)
- **C) \( p=4 \):** 15% (Might see the numbers 3 and 12 and jump to an incorrect conclusion.)
- **D) \( p=\frac{1}{9} \):** 5% (Unlikely, as it's not directly related to common mistakes with the numbers given.)

### proficient:
- **A) \( p=\frac{1}{4} \):** 20% (While proficient, some might still fall into the trap of "Multiplication-to-Numerator Migration.")
- **B) \( p=\frac{1}{36} \):** 60% (Understand the algebraic manipulation well and can solve it correctly.)
- **C) \( p=4 \):** 10% (Might overcomplicate or misinterpret the equation.)
- **D) \( p=\frac{1}{9} \):** 10% (Some residual confusion or incorrect manipulation.)

### advanced:
- **A) \( p=\frac{1}{4} \):** 5% (Unlikely to make the common mistakes; this could be due to a careless error.)
- **B) \( p=\frac{1}{36} \):** 80% (Easily solve it correctly with a solid understanding of algebra.)
- **C) \( p=4 \):** 5% (Highly unlikely, but not impossible with a complex mistake.)
- **D) \( p=\frac{1}{9} \):** 10% (Might see this in more advanced algebraic manipulations or related topics.)

Given these predictions:

below_basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
