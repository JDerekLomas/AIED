To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with it.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\) using the FOIL method or a similar approach.

## Step 2: Identifying Common Misconceptions
The common misconception identified across various perspectives is the "Negative Integer Multiplication Bug" or "Two Negatives Make a Negative" bug, where students believe that multiplying two negative numbers results in a negative number.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(m^{2}-2m-35\)
- Option B: \(m^{2}-12m+35\) (Correct answer)
- Option C: \(m^{2}+12m+35\)
- Option D: \(m^{2}-12m-35\)

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
Given the misconceptions, students are likely to struggle with the multiplication of the constant terms \(-5 \times -7\).

## 5: Ability Levels and Error Rates
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level are likely to have significant difficulties with algebraic manipulations and may not even attempt the FOIL method correctly. They might choose Option A or C due to a lack of understanding of how to expand the brackets or incorrectly apply basic arithmetic operations.
- **Basic:** Students here may understand the FOIL method but are prone to errors in calculations, especially with negative numbers. They are likely to choose Option D due to the misconception that two negatives make a negative.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level have a good grasp of algebraic methods but might still make careless errors. They are less likely to choose Option D and more likely to choose Option B, but there's still a chance for errors leading to Options A, C, or D.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to accurately apply algebraic rules and are less likely to fall into common misconceptions. They should predominantly choose Option B.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Based on the analysis and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% B=10% C=20% D=50%
- **Basic:** A=10% B=20% C=10% D=60%
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=20% D=50%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=10% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
