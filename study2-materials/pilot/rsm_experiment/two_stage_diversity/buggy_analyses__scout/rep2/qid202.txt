Considering the various perspectives on common misconceptions and the typical problem-solving approaches of Year 9 students, here's a prediction of the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

**below_basic:** A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
- Students at this level are more prone to making errors, including the "add-all-numbers" strategy. Option D is likely to be very attractive due to its simplistic and erroneous logic.

**basic:** A=20% B=5% C=5% D=70%
- Students at this level might have some understanding but often fall into common traps. The "add across" misconception for fractions is still prevalent, making Option D a popular but incorrect choice.

**proficient:** A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
- Proficient students are more likely to understand fraction addition but might still be swayed by the logic of adding numerators and denominators, though less so than lower-level students.

**advanced:** A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
- Advanced students would typically have a strong grasp of fraction operations, understanding that denominators must remain the same when adding fractions. They are less likely to be misled by common misconceptions.

These predictions assume that:
- **Option A** is the correct answer, reflecting a proper understanding of adding fractions with common denominators.
- **Option D** is the product of the "add-all-numbers" misconception, which is predicted to be highly attractive to students struggling with fraction concepts.
- **Options B and C** reflect alternative, less common incorrect approaches or misunderstandings (like converting to improper fractions or incorrect simplifications).
