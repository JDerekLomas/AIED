To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the misconceptions and errors identified across the perspectives provided.

### Below Basic
At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and understanding of formulas. They are more prone to making errors due to a lack of foundational knowledge.

- **Option A (\( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \))**: This option reflects a common misconception where students incorrectly manage the fraction and $\pi$. Given the nature of the error, a significant portion might choose this. **40%**
- **Option B (\( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \))**: This option represents another misconception where the student correctly inverts the fraction but might misplace $\pi$. This could appeal to students who try but partially succeed in correcting their mistakes. **30%**
- **Option C (\( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \))**: This is the correct answer. Students at this level might have a lower chance of getting it right due to their limited understanding. **15%**
- **Option D (\( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \))**: This option seems less likely as it involves a different kind of manipulation that might be challenging for below-basic level students. **15%**

### Basic
Students at this level have a better grasp of basic algebra but might still struggle with more complex manipulations.

- **Option A (\( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \))**: Still an attractive option due to the common misconception. **25%**
- **Option B (\( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \))**: This might still appeal but to a lesser extent as students begin to understand inverse operations better. **20%**
- **Option C (\( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \))**: The correct answer becomes more accessible as students' algebraic skills improve. **40%**
- **Option D (\( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \))**: Still a bit challenging but might attract some due to the apparent complexity. **15%**

### Proficient
Proficient students are expected to have a solid understanding of algebra and formula rearrangement.

- **Option A (\( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \))**: Less likely to choose this due to better understanding of algebraic manipulations. **10%**
- **Option B (\( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \))**: Might still be a trap but less often chosen as students recognize the need for the reciprocal. **15%**
- **Option C (\( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \))**: Expected to be the most chosen as it represents the correct manipulation. **60%**
- **Option D (\( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \))**: Could still confuse some, but less likely. **15%**

### Advanced
Advanced students are predicted to have a very strong grasp of algebraic concepts and are less likely to fall into common traps.

- **Option A (\( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \))**: Unlikely to choose this. **5%**
- **Option B (\( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \))**: Also unlikely. **5%**
- **Option C (\( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \))**: Almost certainly the chosen option due to a deep understanding of the algebra. **80%**
- **Option D (\( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \))**: Very unlikely. **10%**

Given the analysis:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
