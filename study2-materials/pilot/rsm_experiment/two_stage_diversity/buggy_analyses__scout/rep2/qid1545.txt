## Step 1: Analyzing the Question and Common Misconceptions
The question requires students to compare two expressions: $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$, and determine the correct symbol to place in the box. The correct mathematical evaluation using BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction) yields $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$ for the left-hand side and $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$ for the right-hand side. Therefore, the correct answer is $>$.

## 2: Understanding Student Misconceptions
Students often struggle with the order of operations, particularly when they ignore BIDMAS and instead process expressions from left to right. This misconception leads them to evaluate $8 + 12 \div 4$ as $(8 + 12) \div 4$, resulting in both expressions equaling $5$. Consequently, these students would choose $=$.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level are likely to have a weak understanding of mathematical concepts, including the order of operations. They are more prone to simple left-to-right processing errors and less likely to apply BIDMAS correctly. Expect a high percentage to choose $=$ due to the left-to-right misconception.
- **Basic:** Students at this level may have some understanding of BIDMAS but often struggle with applying it consistently. They might still fall into the trap of left-to-right processing, especially if they find the calculations "easy" and "clean."
- **Proficient:** Proficient students have a good grasp of BIDMAS and are more likely to evaluate the expressions correctly, choosing $>$. However, some might still be swayed by intuition or careless mistakes.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are expected to have a strong understanding of mathematical concepts, including BIDMAS. They are more likely to choose $>$ correctly.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given the common misconceptions and understanding of student abilities:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (some might guess or have a vague sense), B=10% (less common comparison errors), C=60% (majority fall into the left-to-right trap), D=10% (some confusion with inequality).
- **Basic:** A=40% (starting to apply BIDMAS but might make mistakes), B=15% (some comparative errors), C=40% (still susceptible to the left-to-right error), D=5% (less likely to consider inequalities).
- **Proficient:** A=70% (apply BIDMAS correctly), B=5% (minor errors in comparison), C=20% (some still fall into the trap), D=5% (confusion with inequalities).
- **Advanced:** A=90% (strong understanding and application of BIDMAS), B=0% (unlikely to make basic comparison errors), C=5% (rare but possible careless mistake), D=5% (unlikely but possible).

## 5: Finalizing Percentages
Based on typical student performance and common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic:** A=10%, B=10%, C=75%, D=5%
- **Basic:** A=30%, B=10%, C=55%, D=5%
- **Proficient:** A=60%, B=5%, C=30%, D=5%
- **Advanced:** A=85%, B=5%, C=5%, D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%
basic: A=30% B=10% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=60% B=5% C=30% D=5%
advanced: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
