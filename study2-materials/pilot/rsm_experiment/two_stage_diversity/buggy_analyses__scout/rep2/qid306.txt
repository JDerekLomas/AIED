## Step 1: Analyzing the Perspectives on Student Approach
The provided perspectives all point to a common misconception among Year 9 students regarding the application of BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction), specifically the rigid interpretation that Addition must always come before Subtraction because 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym. This leads to the incorrect prioritization in problems like \(4 - 5 + 6\), where students might choose to do \(5 + 6\) first.

## 2: Understanding the Misconception
The misconception arises from a strict, literal interpretation of BIDMAS without fully understanding that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be performed from left to right. This results in students incorrectly identifying the first calculation for Problem P as \(5 + 6\) and correctly identifying \(5 \times 6\) for Problem Q.

## 3: Relating Misconception to Answer Choices
Given this misconception, students are likely to choose **Option D**: Problem P: \(5 + 6\), Problem Q: \(5 \times 6\). This is because they follow the "rule" that Addition comes before Subtraction (leading to \(5 + 6\) for Problem P) and Multiplication comes before Addition (correctly leading to \(5 \times 6\) for Problem Q).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may not fully understand BIDMAS or the concept of equal priority operations. They might randomly select an option or choose based on a very superficial understanding, potentially leading to a higher percentage on **Option D** due to the commonality of the misconception but also a significant spread across other options due to confusion.

- **Basic**: Students here have a basic grasp of BIDMAS but might not fully comprehend the equal priority of Addition and Subtraction. They are more likely to choose **Option D** because they strictly follow the BIDMAS hierarchy without considering the left-to-right aspect for equal operations.

- **Proficient**: These students have a good understanding of BIDMAS and are less likely to fall into the misconception trap. They should correctly identify \(4 - 5\) for Problem P and \(5 \times 6\) for Problem Q, making **Option B** a likely choice.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand BIDMAS but also the nuances like equal priority operations. They are likely to choose **Option B**: Problem P: \(4 - 5\), Problem Q: \(5 \times 6\), as it correctly applies both the hierarchy and the left-to-right rule for equal operations.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
- **Basic**: A=5% B=15% C=20% D=60%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=70% C=10% D=15%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=15% C=20% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=10% D=15%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
