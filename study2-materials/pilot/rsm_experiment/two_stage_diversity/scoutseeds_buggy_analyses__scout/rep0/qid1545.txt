To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, we must consider common misconceptions and the understanding of mathematical operations, particularly the order of operations (BODMAS/PEDMAS).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to compare two expressions: $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$, and determine the correct symbol ($\ >, \ <, \ =,\ \geq$) that should be placed between them.

## 2: Correct Calculation
First, calculate each expression correctly:
- $8+12 \div 4 = 8 + 3 = 11$
- $(8+12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$
So, $11 > 5$, meaning the correct symbol is $>$.

## 3: Analyzing Misconceptions
- A common misconception is not following the order of operations (BODMAS), which could lead to incorrect calculations.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students might not understand the order of operations or might add first and then divide, or simply not know how to handle the expressions. They might choose $C) =$ because they incorrectly think both equal the same value due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Students at this level might still struggle with applying BODMAS correctly but might have a better grasp of basic operations. They could choose $C) =$ or make another mistake.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to apply BODMAS correctly and choose $A) >$.
- **Advanced**: Students here are expected to not only apply BODMAS correctly but also understand the implications of the operations. They would likely choose $A) >$.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the correct answer is $A) >$:
- **Below Basic**: Might have a high percentage choosing $C) =$ due to a lack of understanding (e.g., $A=20%, B=10%, C=60%, D=10%$).
- **Basic**: Might have a significant portion still choosing $C) =$ but with more spread (e.g., $A=40%, B=20%, C=30%, D=10%$).
- **Proficient**: Expected to mostly choose $A) >$ but with some errors (e.g., $A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%$).
- **Advanced**: Almost all would choose $A) >$ (e.g., $A=95%, B=0%, C=5%, D=0%$).

The best answer is 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
