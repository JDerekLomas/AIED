## Step 1: Analyzing the Question and Common Misconceptions
The question requires students to add two fractions with different denominators: \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\). A common misconception is adding the numerators and denominators separately, which would result in \(\frac{7}{3x}\) (option B).

## 2: Understanding Student Misconceptions and Errors
Students often struggle with finding a common denominator when adding fractions. For the given fractions, the common denominator is \(2x\), so the correct calculation involves converting \(\frac{4}{x}\) to \(\frac{8}{2x}\) and then adding it to \(\frac{3}{2x}\), resulting in \(\frac{11}{2x}\) (option A).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level are likely to have significant difficulties with algebraic expressions and fractions. They might resort to simple addition of numerators and denominators or other incorrect methods, leading to a higher likelihood of choosing option B (\(\frac{7}{3x}\)) or possibly being unsure and choosing randomly.

- **Basic:** Students at this level might understand basic fraction addition but still struggle with finding common denominators in algebraic contexts. They are more likely to choose option B (\(\frac{7}{3x}\)) due to the misconception of adding numerators and denominators.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students should be able to find a common denominator and add the fractions correctly. They would likely choose option A (\(\frac{11}{2x}\)) as it reflects the correct application of finding a common denominator and adding fractions.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students are expected to not only solve the problem correctly but also understand why their method is correct. They would likely choose option A (\(\frac{11}{2x}\)) and possibly be able to explain their reasoning.

## 4: Assigning Percentages
Based on common misconceptions and expected understanding:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (some might guess correctly or through calculation), B=60% (common misconception), C=10%, D=10%.
- **Basic:** A=40%, B=50%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=80%, B=15%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** A=95%, B=5%, C=0%, D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=50% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
