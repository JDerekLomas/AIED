To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with algebraic expressions, particularly focusing on the expression \( c \div (h + 4) \) and the provided answer choices.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Algebraic Convention
The correct algebraic convention for \( c \div (h + 4) \) is \( \frac{c}{h + 4} \), which directly corresponds to option A. This expression correctly represents \( c \) divided by the sum of \( h \) and \( 4 \).

## 2: Analyzing Misconceptions for Each Option
- **Option B (\( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \))**: This option might be chosen by students who misunderstand the distribution of operations or incorrectly apply algebraic manipulations.
- **Option C (\( \frac{c}{h} + 4 \))**: This choice reflects a common misconception where students incorrectly separate the division and addition operations, treating the division as if it only applies to \( c \) and \( h \), and then adding \( 4 \) separately.
- **Option D (\( \frac{h+4}{c} \))**: This option would likely be chosen by students who completely misunderstand the order of operations or the representation of division in algebraic expressions.

## 3: Assessing Student Performance by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to have significant difficulties with algebraic notation and operations. They might choose options B, C, or D due to a lack of understanding of basic algebraic conventions.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still struggle with nuances of algebraic expressions. They are more likely to choose option A but might still be tempted by option C due to its seemingly logical but incorrect separation of operations.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid grasp of algebraic concepts and are less likely to choose incorrect options. They should predominantly choose option A.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding of algebraic expressions and conventions. They are expected to choose option A without hesitation.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some understanding of basic division), B=30% (misinterpretation of operations), C=40% (incorrect separation), D=10% (complete misunderstanding).
- **Basic**: A=60% (understanding of basic conventions), B=20% (some misinterpretation), C=15% (less common now but still present), D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=90% (strong understanding), B=5%, C=4%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=1%, D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
