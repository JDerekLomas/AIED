To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, we need to consider common misconceptions and the understanding of mathematical operations, particularly the multiplication of negative numbers.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question involves multiplying two terms indicated by arrows in the expression \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), specifically \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## 2: Analyzing Misconceptions
- A common misconception is that multiplying two negative numbers results in a negative number, which would lead to \(-4\) (Option B).
- Another possible mistake could be adding the numbers and keeping a negative sign or misinterpreting the operation, but the most prevalent error related to sign rules would guide students towards Option B.

## 3: Ability Levels and Expected Outcomes
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may not understand the basic rules of multiplying negative numbers. They might choose Option B ( \(-4\) ) because they incorrectly think multiplying two negatives gives a negative, or they might choose Option D ( \(-5\) ) due to a miscalculation or incorrect application of rules. Option A ( \(+4\) ) is the correct answer but may not be chosen by many due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding but might still struggle with applying the rules correctly under pressure. They are more likely to choose Option B due to the misconception about negative times negative.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students generally understand that two negatives make a positive. However, some might still choose Option B if they are careless or haven’t fully consolidated this rule. Most should choose Option A.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are expected to have a solid grasp of the rules and should predominantly choose Option A.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis, here are estimated percentages:

### below_basic
- A=10% (some might guess correctly or have a basic understanding)
- B=60% (common misconception)
- C=5% (unlikely, as it involves incorrect addition or unrelated concept)
- D=25% (another misconception or error)

### basic
- A=20% (starting to grasp concepts, but might make careless errors)
- B=70% (still common misconception)
- C=0% (least likely, as it's not related to common errors)
- D=10% (less likely, but could happen due to confusion)

### proficient
- A=80% (understand concepts but could make minor errors)
- B=15% (some might forget or misapply rules)
- C=0% (not a likely option)
- D=5% (unlikely)

### advanced
- A=95% (confident in applying rules)
- B=5% (unlikely, but careless error possible)
- C=0% (not relevant)
- D=0% (correct understanding)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=70% C=0% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
