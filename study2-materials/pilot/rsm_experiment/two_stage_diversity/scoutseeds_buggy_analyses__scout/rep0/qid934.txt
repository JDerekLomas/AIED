To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or understanding that students might have.

## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question provides an equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) and a table of values with \(x = 0\) and \(y\) missing. Students need to find \(y\) when \(x = 0\).

## 2: Solve the Equation for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation gives \(4(0) + 2y = 10\), which simplifies to \(2y = 10\), and hence \(y = 5\).

## 3: Analyze Possible Misconceptions
- **A = 20%**: This might come from a student incorrectly thinking \(y = 10\) when \(x = 0\), not realizing \(2y = 10\) means \(y = 5\).
- **B = 3%**: This could result from a miscalculation or incorrect substitution, such as \(y = 10 - 4x\) without considering coefficients, leading to incorrect values.
- **C = 5%**: Correct calculation yields \(y = 5\), which matches this option.
- **D = 2.5%**: This might come from incorrect algebraic manipulation, such as solving \(2y = 10 - 4x\) and getting \(y = (10 - 4x)/2\), but evaluating it incorrectly.

## 4: Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They could be more likely to choose incorrect options due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have some understanding but might make simple errors in calculation.
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebra well and are less likely to make calculation errors.
- **Advanced**: Students with advanced skills are likely to choose the correct option and understand the underlying algebra.

## 5: Predicting Percentages
Given the correct answer is \(C = 5\), and assuming students' understanding increases with ability level:
- **Below Basic**: Might have a high chance of choosing \(A\) or other incorrect options due to lack of understanding. \(A=40\%\), \(B=30\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=10\%\).
- **Basic**: Have some grasp but still might make simple errors. \(A=20\%\), \(B=15\%\), \(C=55\%\), \(D=10\%\).
- **Proficient**: Should mostly get it right but some might slip. \(A=5\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=85\%\), \(D=5\%\).
- **Advanced**: Should all get it right or have a very low error rate. \(A=0\%\), \(B=0\%\), \(C=95\%\), \(D=5\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
