## Step 1: Analyze the question and the options provided
The question requires the evaluation of the expression \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). To solve it correctly, one must follow the order of operations as per BIDMAS/BODMAS: Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.

## 2: Evaluate the expression correctly
Following BIDMAS/BODMAS:
1. Multiply 4 by 2: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Subtract 5 from 3: \(3 - 5 = -2\)
3. Add 8 to -2: \(-2 + 8 = 6\)

So, the correct answer is A) \(6\).

## 3: Consider common misconceptions
A common misconception is performing operations from left to right without adhering to BIDMAS/BODMAS. For example:
1. \(3 - 5 = -2\)
2. \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
3. \(-2 + 8 = 6\)

Interestingly, this still leads to \(6\), which is the correct answer, indicating that the misconception described doesn't lead to a wrong answer in this specific case.

## 4: Identify another common error
Another error could be:
\(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\), then \(2 \times 2 = 4\) (if mistakenly taking \(\times 2\) from the \(4 \times 2\) but applying it wrongly).

## 5: Assess student performance based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students might not understand or apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly. They might perform operations sequentially from left to right or make calculation errors. Given the mistake identified (e.g., \(3-5= -2\), \( -2 + 4 = 2\), \(2 \times 2 = 4\)), they might lean towards B) \(4\).
- **Basic:** Students have a basic understanding but might struggle with applying BIDMAS/BODMAS consistently. They could be inclined towards incorrect options if their understanding is not solid, possibly B) \(4\) due to miscalculation.
- **Proficient:** Students are more likely to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly and reach A) \(6\).
- **Advanced:** These students are highly likely to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly and choose A) \(6\), with minimal errors.

## 6: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level for each option
Given the correct answer is A) \(6\), and considering common errors:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (some get it right by chance), B=30% (common error), C=10%, D=20%
- **Basic:** A=60%, B=25%, C=5%, D=10%
- **Proficient:** A=80%, B=15%, C=3%, D=2%
- **Advanced:** A=95%, B=4%, C=1%, D=0%

The best answer is A.
