To provide a well-structured prediction based on common misconceptions and understanding of mathematical operations among UK Year 9 students, let's assess the likely choices for each ability level:

### Below Basic
At this level, students might struggle significantly with the order of operations and understanding the impact of brackets.

- A) \( > \): 40% (common misconception leading to incorrect calculations)
- B) \( < \): 20% (students might get the correct calculation but misunderstand the comparison or make calculation errors)
- C) \( = \): 30% (students incorrectly assume both sides are equal due to oversight of operational order)
- D) \( \geq \): 10% (less common, as it involves a partial understanding but incorrect application)

### Basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding but are prone to making errors, especially with the order of operations.

- A) \( > \): 50% (recognizing the left side is greater due to correct or intuitive calculations)
- B) \( < \): 25% (students who correctly calculate both but might confuse the comparison)
- C) \( = \): 20% (students still confused about the correct order of operations)
- D) \( \geq \): 5% (rare, as students are more likely to understand inequality basics)

### Proficient
Proficient students understand the order of operations but might still make occasional mistakes under pressure.

- A) \( > \): 60% (correctly calculating and comparing, understanding \(8 + 12 \div 4 = 11\) and \((8+12) \div 4 = 5\))
- B) \( < \): 10% (unlikely, as proficient students understand the basic calculations)
- C) \( = \): 25% (some might still hold misconceptions or make calculation errors)
- D) \( \geq \): 5% (rare, but possible for those not fully secure)

### Advanced
Advanced students have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, including the order of operations.

- A) \( > \): 80% (accurately calculate and compare both expressions)
- B) \( < \): 5% (uncommon, as advanced students are familiar with correct order of operations)
- C) \( = \): 10% (rare, for those who might double-check but still make an error)
- D) \( \geq \): 5% (understanding but applying inequality signs with precision)

Given the perspectives and likely student understanding:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=60% B=10% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
