To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or errors that might lead students to select incorrect options.

## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question provides an equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) and a table of values with \(x = 0\) and an empty space for \(y\). Students need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\).

## 2: Solve the Equation for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation gives \(4(0) + 2y = 10\), which simplifies to \(2y = 10\). Solving for \(y\) yields \(y = 5\). This corresponds to option C.

## 3: Analyze Potential Misconceptions
- A common misconception might involve incorrect algebraic manipulations or arithmetic mistakes. For example, mistakenly solving for \(y\) as \(y = 10 * 2 = 20\) (option A) could happen if a student misunderstands the division by 2.

## 4: Assess Student Performance by Ability Level
### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and arithmetic. They could be prone to simple arithmetic mistakes or not fully understand how to solve for \(y\).
- A: 30% (simple mistake of doubling)
- B: 15% (guessing or incorrect calculation)
- C: 40% (actually solving it correctly or recognizing the correct answer)
- D: 15% (another incorrect calculation or guess)

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra but might make simple mistakes.
- A: 10% (misunderstanding of operations)
- B: 20% ( incorrect calculation or substitution)
- C: 60% (correctly solving for \(y\))
- D: 10% (mistake in calculation)

### proficient
Students at this level are comfortable with basic algebra and less likely to make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- A: 5% (unlikely to make such a basic mistake)
- B: 10% (minor mistake or confusion)
- C: 80% (correctly solving the equation)
- D: 5% (unlikely but possible minor error)

### advanced
Students at this level have a strong understanding of algebra and are less likely to make mistakes.
- A: 0% (very unlikely to make such a mistake)
- B: 5% (possible but less likely mistake)
- C: 90% (confidently and correctly solving for \(y\))
- D: 5% (extremely unlikely error)

The best answer is C.
