To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to calculating the mean.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the correct calculation of the mean from the given set of numbers: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. The correct formula for the mean is the sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers. So, the correct calculation is \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \).

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). This option incorrectly omits the 0 from the sum but correctly divides by 5.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \). This option implies a misunderstanding of the order of operations, as it suggests dividing 7 by 5 before adding the other numbers.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \). This option incorrectly omits the 0 from the sum and also divides by 4 instead of 5.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D states "None of them," which would be correct if none of the provided calculations yield the correct mean.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of mean or might have significant difficulties with basic arithmetic operations. They are likely to choose options that reflect common misconceptions.
  - A: 20% (some might realize the division by 5 is correct but omit 0)
  - B: 30% (misunderstanding of operations)
  - C: 40% (easy mistake to make, omitting 0 and incorrect count)
  - D: 10%

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still struggle with applying concepts correctly.
  - A: 40% (recognize division by 5 but might omit 0)
  - B: 25% (some might see it as a plausible but incorrect order)
  - C: 25% (common mistake)
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient:** Students here understand the concept but might make careless mistakes.
  - A: 20% (might see it as almost correct)
  - B: 10% (recognize the mistake in order of operations)
  - C: 5% (less likely to make this error)
  - D: 65%

- **Advanced:** These students have a strong understanding and are less likely to make basic errors.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 0%
  - D: 90%

The best answer is 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
