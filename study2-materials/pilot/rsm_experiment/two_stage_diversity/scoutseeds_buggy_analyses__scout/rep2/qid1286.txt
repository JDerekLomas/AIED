## Step 1: Understand the Question and Options
The question asks for the radius of a sphere given its volume \( V \) and provides four options for the radius \( r \): 
A: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \),
B: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \),
C: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \),
D: \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \).

## 2: Recall the Correct Formula
The correct formula for the volume of a sphere is \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \), which rearranges to \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}} \).

## 3: Analyze Option C
Option C, \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \), matches the correct rearrangement of the volume formula to solve for \( r \).

## 4: Consider Common Misconceptions
- A common error is misplacing or misinterpreting coefficients and constants, which could lead to choosing B: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \) or A: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \).
- Option D: \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \) seems less likely as it does not directly derive from a simple misinterpretation of the formula.

## 5: Assess Student Performance by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students might not understand the formula or how to rearrange it, likely choosing an option that seems plausible but incorrect, such as B or A.
- **Basic**: Students might be familiar with the formula but struggle with rearranging it, potentially choosing B.
- **Proficient**: Students should be able to correctly rearrange the formula, choosing C.
- **Advanced**: Students are likely to choose C and might also recognize the errors leading to other options.

## 6: Estimate Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% ( incorrect but straightforward), B=30% (attractive error), C=30% (some understanding), D=20% (completely off).
- **Basic**: A=15%, B=35%, C=40%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=20%, C=70%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=5%, C=90%, D=5%.

## 7: Standardize Format
The response will be standardized as requested.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=20% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
