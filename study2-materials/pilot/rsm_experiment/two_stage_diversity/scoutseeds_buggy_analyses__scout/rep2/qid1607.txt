Based on the analysis provided across the different perspectives, here's a predicted breakdown of how students at various ability levels might respond:

below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
basic: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=2% C=2% D=6%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=2% D=2%

This breakdown reflects the expectation that as students' ability levels increase, so does their likelihood of correctly identifying that only Step 1 is correct. Students at the lower end of the ability spectrum (below_basic and basic) might be more inclined to select incorrect options due to a lack of understanding or misinterpretation of algebraic procedures. In contrast, proficient and advanced students are more likely to accurately assess the steps and choose the correct answer, A) Only step 1.
