To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with algebraic expressions, particularly focusing on the division of a variable by a sum.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Answer
The correct answer is A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), as it properly represents \( c \div (h + 4) \) using algebraic conventions. This expression maintains the parentheses in the denominator, correctly following the order of operations.

## 2: Analyzing Misconceptions for Each Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic concepts and the order of operations. They are more likely to choose an option that seems to simplify the expression incorrectly or misunderstand the division by a sum. Option C: \( \frac{c}{h} + 4 \) could be attractive due to its seeming simplicity and incorrect application of operations.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still struggle with applying conventions strictly. They might be tempted by options that incorrectly distribute or apply operations, making Option C a potential choice.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand algebraic conventions and the order of operations. They are less likely to choose incorrect options but might still be tempted if they misinterpret the division.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students have a strong grasp of algebraic concepts and are less likely to make mistakes in representing expressions.

## 3: Predicting Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (understanding the concept but struggling with representation), B=10% (incorrect addition in numerator), C=40% (misapplication of operations), D=10% (inverting the fraction and misunderstanding).
- **Basic:** A=70% (solid understanding of basic concepts), B=10% (misunderstanding of operation), C=15% (some misconception), D=5% (significant misunderstanding).
- **Proficient:** A=90% (strong understanding), B=5% (minor misconception), C=3% (rare but possible mistake), D=2% (unlikely).
- **Advanced:** A=98% (excellent grasp), B=1% (minor error), C=0.5% (rare error), D=0.5% (very unlikely).

## 4: Finalizing Predictions
Based on typical student performance and common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic:** A=40%, B=10%, C=40%, D=10%
- **Basic:** A=70%, B=10%, C=15%, D=5%
- **Proficient:** A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%
- **Advanced:** A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
