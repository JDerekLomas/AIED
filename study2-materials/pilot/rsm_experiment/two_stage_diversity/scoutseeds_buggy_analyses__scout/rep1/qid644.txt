## Step 1: Analyzing the Question
The question requires students to multiply two terms indicated by arrows, -1 and -4, from the brackets (2p-1)(3p-4). The correct calculation is \(-1 \times -4 = 4\), which corresponds to option A: \( +4 \).

## 2: Understanding the Misconceptions
All four perspectives provided discuss a common misconception where students believe that multiplying two negative numbers results in a negative number, leading them to choose option B: \( -4 \).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and are more likely to make errors. Given the nature of the question, a significant portion might choose option B due to the misconception.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may still be prone to simple errors, including misconceptions about negative number multiplication.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level are expected to have a solid grasp of arithmetic operations, including the multiplication of negative numbers. They are less likely to choose option B.
- **Advanced**: These students have a strong understanding and are unlikely to fall into common misconceptions.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given the common misconception discussed, let's estimate:
- **Below Basic**: A=10% (some might get it right by chance or have a basic understanding), B=80% (most would fall into the misconception), C=5%, D=5%.
- **Basic**: A=50% (half understand the concept), B=40% (some still fall into the misconception), C=3%, D=7%.
- **Proficient**: A=90% (most understand the concept), B=5% (few might still have the misconception), C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: A=98% (almost all get it right), B=1% (very few would have the misconception), C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

## 5: Finalizing Percentages
Based on the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%
- **Basic**: A=50%, B=40%, C=3%, D=7%
- **Proficient**: A=90%, B=5%, C=2%, D=3%
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=50% B=40% C=3% D=7%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
