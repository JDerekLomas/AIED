## Step 1: Analyzing the question and options
The question asks for the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div (h+4) \). The correct answer is \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which corresponds to option A.

## 2: Understanding student misconceptions
From the perspectives provided, common misconceptions include:
- Incorrectly distributing or adding within the numerator (leading to option B).
- Misinterpreting division as implying addition or incorrect handling of parentheses (leading to option C).
- Incorrectly reversing the division (not directly mentioned but could lead to option D).

## 3: Assessing student performance by ability level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to have significant misconceptions. They might choose B, C, or D due to a lack of understanding of algebraic notation and operations. Option A might be chosen by a few who have a basic understanding or by chance.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may still struggle with algebraic conventions. They are more likely to choose A but might still be tempted by B or C due to lingering misconceptions.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebraic concepts and are less likely to choose B, C, or D. They should predominantly choose A.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will easily identify the correct convention and choose A. They are less likely to entertain misconceptions.

## 4: Estimating percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=20%, B=40%, C=30%, D=10% (significant struggle, with a spread across incorrect options)
- **Basic**: A=60%, B=20%, C=15%, D=5% (improved understanding, but still some misconceptions)
- **Proficient**: A=85%, B=10%, C=4%, D=1% (strong understanding, minor misconceptions)
- **Advanced**: A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1% (high understanding, rare misconceptions)

## 5: Finalizing percentages in the required format
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
