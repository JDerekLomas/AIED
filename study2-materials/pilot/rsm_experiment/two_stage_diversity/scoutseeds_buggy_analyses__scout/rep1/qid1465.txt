## Step 1: Analyzing the Question and Common Misconceptions
The question requires the application of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) to solve the expression \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). Common misconceptions include performing operations from left to right without adhering to the BIDMAS/BODMAS rules.

## 2: Understanding the BIDMAS/BODMAS Rules
According to BIDMAS/BODMAS, the correct order is: Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. Applying this to the given expression:
1. Multiply \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Then, \(3 - 5 = -2\)
3. Finally, \(-2 + 8 = 6\)

So, the correct answer is A) \(6\).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may not understand or apply the BIDMAS/BODMAS rules effectively. They might perform operations randomly or from left to right. Options B) \(4\), C) \(-12\), and D) \(-10\) could be attractive to students who do not apply the correct order of operations or make calculation errors.

- **Basic**: Students at this level may have some understanding of the order of operations but might struggle with applying it consistently. They might choose A) \(6\) if they've understood the concept, but could also be misled into B) \(4\) if they perform addition before multiplication.

- **Proficient**: Proficient students are expected to apply the BIDMAS/BODMAS rules correctly, leading them to choose A) \(6\). However, some might still make minor errors or be distracted into other options.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to have a strong grasp of the BIDMAS/BODMAS rules and would choose A) \(6\). They are less likely to be misled by common misconceptions.

## 4: Estimating Percentages for Each Ability Level
Given the nature of the question and common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some understanding but error-prone), B=30% (left-to-right or incorrect application), C=20% (random or incorrect calculation), D=30% (random or significant calculation error).
- **Basic**: A=60% (applying BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly), B=30% (misapplication of rules), C=5% (significant error), D=5% (significant error).
- **Proficient**: A=85% (correct application), B=10% (minor misapplication), C=2% (calculation error), D=3% (calculation error).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (strong understanding and correct application), B=3% (rare misapplication), C=1% (rare calculation error), D=1% (rare calculation error).

## 5: Converting Estimates to Required Format
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
