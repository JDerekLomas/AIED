To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the typical performance of students at different levels.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires solving a simple linear equation: \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\). The correct solution involves dividing both sides by 3, which yields \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 2: Analyzing Student Performance
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level often struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and fraction operations. They are more likely to make significant errors.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still struggle with more complex operations or applying inverse operations correctly.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level can generally solve simple equations and perform basic algebraic manipulations correctly but might make occasional mistakes under pressure or with more complex problems.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are confident and accurate in solving equations, including those involving fractions.

## 3: Predicting Student Choices
Given the nature of the question and common misconceptions:
- **A (\(p = \frac{1}{4}\)):** This would result from multiplying \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3 instead of dividing by 3, a plausible mistake for students not confident in fraction division or inverse operations.
- **B (\(p = \frac{1}{36}\)):** This is the correct answer, achieved by correctly dividing \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3.
- **C (\(p = 4\)):** This seems an unlikely and significant error, possibly from misinterpreting the equation.
- **D (\(p = \frac{1}{9}\)):** Another incorrect option, which might arise from incorrect operations or misunderstandings of fractions.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic:** These students might struggle significantly. Option A could be tempting due to simple multiplication error (A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%).
- **Basic:** Students here might make fewer errors but could still fall into common traps. A plausible estimate could be A=30%, B=50%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students are likely to solve it correctly but might have occasional lapses. So, A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** These students are confident and mostly accurate. Hence, A=5%, B=90%, C=2%, D=3%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=50% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
