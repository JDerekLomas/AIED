To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions that might lead students to select incorrect answers.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question provides an equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) and a table of values with \(x = 0\) and \(y = \bigstar\). Students need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\).

## 2: Solving the Equation for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation:
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]
\[y = 5\]
So, the correct answer is \(C = 5\).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
- **A (20):** This would likely result from a significant misconception or miscalculation, such as mistakenly solving for \(y\) with a wrong substitution or operation.
- **B (3):** Could result from incorrect algebraic manipulation or substitution.
- **D (2.5):** Might come from dividing incorrectly or misinterpreting the equation.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
### below_basic:
- These students might not fully understand algebraic substitution or solving for \(y\). They could guess or apply incorrect operations.
- \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 15\%\), \(C = 40\%\), \(D = 25\%\)

### basic:
- Students at this level have a basic understanding but might make simple arithmetic mistakes or misunderstand the equation.
- \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 60\%\), \(D = 20\%\)

### proficient:
- These students understand algebra but might still make occasional mistakes under pressure.
- \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 80\%\), \(D = 10\%\)

### advanced:
- Advanced students are likely to solve the equation correctly with minimal mistakes.
- \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 0\%\), \(C = 95\%\), \(D = 5\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
