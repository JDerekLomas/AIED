To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or understanding that students at different levels might have.

## Step 1: Analyzing the Question and Misconceptions
The question involves solving a simple linear equation: \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\). The correct steps involve multiplying both sides by 4 to get \(60 = 1 + k\), and then subtracting 1 from both sides to get \(k = 59\). Isaac's steps show \(60 = 1 + k\) as Step 1, which is correct, and \(61 = k\) as Step 2, which is incorrect.

## 2: Understanding Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations or might not understand how to solve equations involving fractions. They could incorrectly choose any option based on a lack of understanding.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple mistakes. They are likely to recognize Step 1 as correct but could be unsure or incorrectly assess Step 2.
- **Proficient:** These students understand algebraic manipulations well and are likely to identify Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect, leading them to choose option A.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the manipulations but are also quick to identify errors. They would likely choose option A as the correct answer without hesitation.

## 3: Predicting Percentages
- **Below Basic:** These students might not fully understand the equation-solving process. They could be more likely to choose **D (Both steps are incorrect)** because they see an error in Step 2 and might not validate Step 1 properly. **A=30%**, **B=10%**, **C=5%**, **D=55%**
- **Basic:** Basic students might see Step 1 as correct but struggle with Step 2, potentially leading them to choose **A (Only step 1)** if they recognize the mistake in Step 2. **A=60%**, **B=20%**, **C=5%**, **D=15%**
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are likely to accurately identify Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect, choosing **A (Only step 1)**. **A=80%**, **B=5%**, **C=5%**, **D=10%**
- **Advanced:** Advanced students would surely choose **A (Only step 1)**, having no trouble identifying the correct step and the mistake. **A=90%**, **B=0%**, **C=0%**, **D=10%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=5% D=55%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
