Given the perspectives provided, here's an assessment based on typical student understanding and common misconceptions:

- **Below Basic**: At this level, students might struggle significantly with the FOIL method and handling negative signs.
  - A: $10\%$ (simple error, might swap or miscalculate constants)
  - B: $20\%$ (correct application seen as hard; some get it right even here)
  - C: $15\%$ (incorrectly add inside terms; add $m$'s; wrong constants but right process sometimes; usually get operation mix-ups or constant)
  - D: $55\%$ (large possibility, subtract throughout incorrectly; typical for misguided application or careless handling of sign-change, frequently add errors seen)

- **Basic**: Students here are developing their algebraic skills but might make more errors due to less familiarity with applying FOIL consistently.
  - A: $5\%$ (less miscalculations in handling the $m$ but usually constants)
  - B: $40\%$ (getting the hang of using FOIL but mistakes abound across calculation range)
  - C: $10\%$ (start using $+$ more but likely retain one right detail on equation balancing with less comprehension; errors reduce on simpler terms usually picked-up eaily here though on right tack getting)
  - D: $45\%$ (misapplication; usually do sign errors more likely on higher targets to achieve lower on the marking scale here given on progression through topics. Common error due misapplication across these lower spectrum abilities )

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp or commonly recall method on more usual assessments. Errors start at conceptual handling mistaken through on oversight basis
  - A: $0\%$ (rare, or wrong constants rarely occur in their calculations in controlled situations.)
  - B: $80\%$ (typically grasp core method across topics well if no hurdling)
  - C: $5\%$ (not usual now)
  - D: $15\%$ (careless; less frequently on typical error types; sign slip not hard)

- **Advanced**: Here, precision is more characteristic 
  - A: $0\%$ (essentially understanding specifics now. FOIL well managed in tests, minimal conceptual blocks with algebra)
  - B: $90\%$   - 
  - C:  $0\%$
  - D: $10\%$
