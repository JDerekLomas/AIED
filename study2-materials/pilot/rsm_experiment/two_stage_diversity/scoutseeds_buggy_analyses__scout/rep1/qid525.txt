To accurately predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, we must consider the nature of the misconceptions and the typical performance of students at different levels.

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand basic fraction operations or how to add mixed numbers. They are more likely to exhibit misconceptions such as adding numerators and denominators directly.

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may still struggle with applying procedures correctly, especially with fractions and mixed numbers.

- **Proficient**: These students understand the basic operations and can apply them correctly most of the time but might occasionally slip into misconceptions under pressure or with complex problems.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts accurately, even with complex problems. They are less likely to fall into common misconceptions.

Given these definitions:

## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \( \frac{99}{20} \), is an improper fraction. Students below the basic level might not know how to convert mixed numbers to improper fractions or vice versa, but proficient and advanced students would likely recognize this as a correct conversion but might not choose it if asked to leave the answer as a mixed number.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \), is the correct answer. Advanced and proficient students are likely to choose this option as it demonstrates a correct understanding of adding mixed numbers. Basic students might get this with some effort, while below basic students are less likely to.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \frac{99}{40} \), seems to result from incorrect calculations (not directly matching common misconceptions described). It might appeal to students who misunderstand fraction addition but is less directly related to the described misconceptions.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \), results from the misconception of adding fractions by adding numerators and denominators. Below basic and basic students are more likely to choose this due to the attractive nature of the error.

## 5: Predicting Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (not understanding mixed numbers), B=10% (correct but challenging), C=10% (random or incorrect calculation), D=60% (attractive error).
- **Basic**: A=5% (rarely convert correctly), B=40% (getting it right with effort), C=5% (incorrect), D=50% (common misconception).
- **Proficient**: A=0% (understand format), B=80% (correct), C=0% (aware of correct procedures), D=20% (occasional slip).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95% (easily correct), C=0%, D=5% (very rare mistake).

The best answer is B.
