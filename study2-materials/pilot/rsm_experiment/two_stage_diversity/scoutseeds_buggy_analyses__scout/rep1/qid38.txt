To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with adding fractions.

The correct solution involves finding a common denominator:
\[
\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}
\]
So, the correct answer is A: \( \frac{11}{2x} \).

## Step 1: Analyzing the Misconceptions
- The misconception of adding numerators and denominators separately leads to B: \( \frac{7}{3x} \).
- Other options might arise from incorrect calculations or misunderstandings of fraction addition.

## 2: Assessing Student Performance
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand the concept of adding fractions with different denominators. They are likely to choose B: \( \frac{7}{3x} \) because it seems like a straightforward addition of numerators and denominators. Some might choose C or D due to a lack of understanding or simple arithmetic errors.

## 3: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic:** 
  - A: 10% (understanding that fractions need to be adjusted but incorrect)
  - B: 60% (common misconception of adding numerators and denominators)
  - C: 15% (incorrect calculation or misunderstanding)
  - D: 15% (another incorrect approach)

- **Basic:** 
  - A: 40% (starting to understand the need for a common denominator but might make mistakes)
  - B: 30% (still falling into the common misconception)
  - C: 15% (confusion with calculations)
  - D: 15% (alternative incorrect approach)

- **Proficient:** 
  - A: 80% (understands the process of finding a common denominator)
  - B: 10% (some might still make the simple mistake)
  - C: 5% (occasional confusion)
  - D: 5% (rare mistake)

- **Advanced:** 
  - A: 95% (strong understanding, minimal errors)
  - B: 3% (rarely make such basic mistakes)
  - C: 1% (very occasional confusion)
  - D: 1% (extremely rare mistake)

The best answer is B.
