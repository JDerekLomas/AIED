## Step 1: Analyze the question and the options provided
The question requires students to compare two expressions, \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\), and determine the correct symbol to place in the box between them. The correct calculation for each expression is needed to answer the question accurately.

## 2: Calculate the correct values for each expression
To calculate \(8+12 \div 4\):
1. Division first: \(12 \div 4 = 3\)
2. Then addition: \(8 + 3 = 11\)

To calculate \((8+12) \div 4\):
1. Operations inside the brackets: \(8 + 12 = 20\)
2. Then division: \(20 \div 4 = 5\)

## 3: Compare the calculated values
Comparing the two results: \(11 > 5\), which means \(8+12 \div 4 > (8+12) \div 4\). Therefore, the correct symbol to place in the box is \(>\).

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and student understanding
Students who do not fully understand the order of operations (BODMAS/BPEMDAS) might incorrectly calculate the expressions, leading them to choose the wrong symbol. Common errors include performing operations from left to right without following the order of operations.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may not understand the order of operations and are likely to make significant errors. They might incorrectly calculate both expressions to be equal or less than, due to a lack of understanding. Expect a high percentage to choose \(C) =\) or \(B) <\).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may still struggle with applying the order of operations consistently. They might choose \(C) =\) if they calculate both to equal 5 or another incorrect value.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations and can apply it. They are likely to calculate the expressions correctly and choose \(A) >\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the order of operations but can also apply it to complex problems. They are expected to choose \(A) >\) correctly.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each ability level
Given the correct answer is \(A) >\):
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some get it right by chance), B=30% (think less than), C=40% (think equal), D=10% (greater than or equal to).
- **Basic**: A=40% (starting to get it), B=25% (some still think less), C=30% (equal), D=5% (greater than or equal to).
- **Proficient**: A=70% (majority get it), B=10% (understanding but minor errors), C=15% (minor misunderstandings), D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=90% (very confident), B=5%, C=4%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=4% D=1%
