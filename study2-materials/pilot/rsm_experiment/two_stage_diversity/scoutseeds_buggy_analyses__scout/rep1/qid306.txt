To accurately predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, we should consider typical misunderstandings and the application of the order of operations (BODMAS/BPEMDAS) in mathematics.

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may not understand or have been taught the order of operations. They might perform operations randomly or from left to right without any rules.

- **Basic**: Students here have some understanding but might not fully apply the BODMAS rule consistently, especially in more complex problems.

- **Proficient**: These students generally understand and can apply the BODMAS/BPEMDAS rule but might make occasional mistakes under pressure or with complex problems.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the rule but can apply it with ease, even in complex scenarios.

Given these descriptions:

## Step 1: Analyzing Option Choice by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to not follow any specific order or might do operations randomly. Option A (\( 4-5 \) and \( 4+5 \)) seems a plausible guess as it involves starting with operations from left to right without understanding precedence. 
- **Basic**: They might start to grasp the concept of doing multiplication before addition but still struggle with applying it correctly in all scenarios. Hence, they might lean towards B due to a basic understanding of left-to-right for equal precedence but correct application in Q.

## 2: Estimating Percentages
- For **Below Basic**, not understanding BODMAS makes A and C more likely due to lack of knowledge (A=40%, B=20%, C=30%, D=10%).
- For **Basic**, some understanding of BODMAS might make B more appealing (A=20%, B=40%, C=25%, D=15%).
- For **Proficient**, a solid grasp of BODMAS/BPEMDAS makes B the obvious choice (A=5%, B=80%, C=5%, D=10%).
- For **Advanced**, B is definitely known, potentially with very few errors (A=0%, B=95%, C=0%, D=5%).

## 3: Providing the Solution
The exact percentages can vary based on educational context and student performance. However, based on a generalization:
- **below_basic**: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
- **basic**: A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
