To arrive at these predictions, I have considered the following common pitfalls:

*   **Option D (The "Top and Bottom" Error):** This is the classic trap for **below_basic** students. They add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), then add the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$). It feels intuitive but ignores the logic of equivalent fractions.
*   **Option C (The Denominator Error):** Often chosen by **basic** level students who remember they need a common denominator but simply multiply the two existing denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) and then struggle with the numerator, or convert to improper fractions but forget to adjust the numerators correctly before adding.
*   **Option A (The "Format" Error):** This represents students who have the correct numerical value ($4 \frac{19}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$) but have failed to follow the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number." **Proficient** students often lose marks here due to exam pressure and failing to re-read the final line of the question.
*   **Option B (The Correct Answer):** Requires finding the common denominator (20) and performing the addition accurately, then recombining into a mixed number.
