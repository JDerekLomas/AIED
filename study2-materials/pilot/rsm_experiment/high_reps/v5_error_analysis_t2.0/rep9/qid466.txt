In this Year 9 mock, students frequently confuse the rules for **reciprocals** (multiplicative inverse) with **negation** (additive inverse).

*   **A ($\frac{4}{3}$)** is the most common "trap" answer. Students correctly identify that they need to flip the fraction to get a value of 1, but they apply the rule for additive inverses (changing the sign) simultaneously, or they remember that a negative times a *something* equals a negative, but fail to realise that *something* must be positive.
*   **B ($-\frac{4}{3}$)** is the correct answer. Students must manage both the reciprocal and the double negative resulting in a negative product.
*   **C ($\frac{3}{4}$)** is chosen by students who believe a negative times a positive stays negative (correct) but think they need the same digits to maintain the value (incorrectly treating the multiplication as if it were a sign-balancing exercise).
*   **D ($-\frac{3}{4}$)** is chosen by the weakest students who simply "match" the digits seen in the question or believe that any number times its identical twin equals 1 (or -1).

The **below_basic** cohort tends to pick D or C based on visual recognition. **Basic** students often get the reciprocal part (the 4 and 3) but overthink the sign and choose A. **Proficient** students usually get it right but some make a "sign slip" under pressure. **Advanced** students see the reciprocal requirement immediately and verify the signs.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=3% B=95% C=1% D=1%
