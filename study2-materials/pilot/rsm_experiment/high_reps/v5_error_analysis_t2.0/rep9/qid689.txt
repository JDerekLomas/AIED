Having marked hundreds of these scripts, this specific question is a classic "trapped" algebraic manipulation. The most common error is students treating the $p$ as a multiplier rather than a divisor, or simply assuming the larger number must be divided by the smaller number ($10 \div 5$).

The specific thought processes behind the errors are:
*   **The $p=2$ trap (C):** This is the most "attractive" wrong answer. Students see 10 and 5 and instinctively calculate $10 \div 5$. They don't process the structure of the fraction.
*   **The $p=50$ trap (B):** These students know they need to "do something" with the $p$. They move it to the other side and multiply ($10 \times 5$), ignoring the fact that $p$ was the denominator.
*   **The $p=0.5$ correct method (A):** Requires two steps: multiplying by $p$ ($10p = 5$) then dividing by 10 ($p = 5/10$).
