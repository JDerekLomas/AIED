Having marked several hundred of these papers, this particular question is a classic "fractional trap." The number 12 and 3 invite a strong mental association with the number 4, which drives the most common errors.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A ($p = 1/4$):** The most common mistake. Students see $3$ and $12$ and instinctively divide $12$ by $3$ to get $4$, keeping it as a denominator. They forget they are actually dividing both sides by 3.
*   **B ($p = 1/36$):** The correct answer. Students must multiply the denominator by 3 (effectively multiplying by $1/3$).
*   **C ($p = 4$):** "Fractional panic." Students ignore the "1 over" part entirely and just do $12 \div 3$. This is very common at below-basic levels.
*   **D ($p = 1/9$):** A "matching" error. Students see $3$ and the idea of "three times something," and their brain grabs $3^2$. It’s less common but pops up among students who are guessing.

**Predicted Distributions:**

basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
