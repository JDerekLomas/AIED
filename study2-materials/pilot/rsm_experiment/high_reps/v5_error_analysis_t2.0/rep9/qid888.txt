In this context, I am evaluating the Year 9 mock papers where the main pitfalls are directed at "directed numbers" (multiplying and adding negatives).

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **The Trap (A):** Students who subtract the two numbers ($7-5 = 2$) or take the difference instead of adding them. This is common for students who haven't mastered the FOIL/Grid method's middle step.
*   **The Sign Error (C):** Students who know $5 \times 7 = 35$ and $5 + 7 = 12$, but completely ignore the signs, treating everything as positive. 
*   **The Sign Error (D):** The "classic" mistake. Students correctly calculate $-5 + -7 = -12$, but then incorrectly conclude that a negative times a negative is a negative $(-5 \times -7 = -35)$.
*   **The Correct Path (B):** Requires two hurdles: correctly summing negatives to $-12$ and correctly multiplying negatives to $+35$.
