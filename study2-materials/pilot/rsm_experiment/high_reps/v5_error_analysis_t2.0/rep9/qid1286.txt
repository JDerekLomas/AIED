To predict the performance of Year 9 students on this question, we must consider the rearranging of the sphere volume formula: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

**Common Errors & Traps:**
*   **The "Multiplying by the Top" Trap (Option A):** Many students see the $4$, $\pi$, and $3$ and simply associate "getting rid of the fraction" with multiplying by everything they see. 
*   **Fraction Flipping Confusion (Option B):** Students often remember they need to divide by the coefficient, but they struggle to handle the $4/3$ alongside the $\pi$, frequently leaving the $\pi$ in the numerator by mistake.
*   **Algebraic Structure (Option D):** Students who are very weak in algebra often try to "un-cube" only the $V$ or fail to realize the radical symbol must encompass the entire expression.
*   **The Target (Option C):** This requires multiplying by 3, then dividing by $4\pi$, and finally taking the cube root.

**Predictions based on 200 Year 9 Mock Papers:**

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%
*(Below basic students often guess based on the numbers they see or fail to apply the cube root to the constant values, leading them to D or A.)*

basic: A=30% B=30% C=25% D=15%
*(Basic students remember the formula but fail the two-step rearrangement of $4/3$. Option B is very attractive here as they misplace $\pi$ in the fraction.)*

proficient: A=10% B=20% C=65% D=5%
*(Proficient students know how to rearrange but are prone to a "sign/position" error with the 3 or the $\pi$. Most will reach the correct answer through step-by-step working.)*

advanced: A=2% B=3% C=95% D=0%
*(Advanced students have practiced subject-rearrangement specifically with geometry formulas and will identify the reciprocal of $4/3$ immediately.)*
