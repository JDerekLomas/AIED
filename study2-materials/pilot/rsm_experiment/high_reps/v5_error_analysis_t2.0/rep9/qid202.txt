After marking 200 of these, I’ve seen every variation of this error. Even though it's a "simple" addition, the wording of the question and the "instinct" to operate on denominators catches a lot of Year 9s out.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A (Correct):** Adding whole numbers (3) and numerators (3) over the common denominator (5).
*   **B (Conversion):** Converting to an improper fraction correctly ($\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}$), but failing to convert back to the "mixed number" requested in the prompt.
*   **C (The "Total Failure"):** Adding everything. $2+1=3$ (forgotten or ignored), $1+2=3$ (numerator), and $5+5=10$ (denominator). $\frac{3}{10}$ or just ignoring the whole numbers entirely.
*   **D (The "Natural Error"):** Adding the whole numbers correctly (3) and the numerators correctly (3), but instinctively adding the denominators as well ($5+5=10$). This is the most common misconception in middle-sets.
