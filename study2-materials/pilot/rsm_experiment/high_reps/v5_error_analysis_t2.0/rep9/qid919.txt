To predict these percentages, I have analysed the following common pedagogical pitfalls:
*   **The "Squaring" Trap (A):** Students multiply both numbers then square ($0.9^2$) or square both and multiply, but often lose the decimal place.
*   **The Order of Operations (C):** The most common conceptual error. Students do $3 \times 0.3$ first to get $0.9$, then square it to get $0.81$, or they simply do $3 \times 0.3 \times 2 = 1.8$ because they mistake squaring for "times 2".
*   **The Place Value Trap (D):** This is the "high-ability error." Students know the steps ($0.3^2 = 0.09$, then $0.09 \times 3$), but they instinctively think $0.3^2 = 0.9$ because their brain skips a decimal place. $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$.
*   **The Correct Calculation (B):** $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$; $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$.

Below are the predicted statistics for a Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=50% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=25% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=10% D=25%
advanced: A=1% B=92% C=2% D=5%
