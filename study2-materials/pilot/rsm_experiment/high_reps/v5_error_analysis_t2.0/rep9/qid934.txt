In this Year 9 mock, this question specifically tests two things: understanding that $x$ and $y$ are variables in an equation rather than just "numbers in a sequence," and the ability to rearrange/solve when the coefficient of $y$ is not $1$.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **A (20):** The "multiplication" trap. Students see $4$, $x$, and $10$. They assume they need to multiply the visible numbers ($4 \times 5$ or $10 \times 2$).
*   **B (3):** The "linear sequence" trap. These students don't look at the equation; they look at the values. Often, Year 9s assume every table must jump by the gradient. They might try to work backward from a guessed middle value or assume a "common difference" logic.
*   **C (5):** The "most attractive" wrong answer. These students substitute $x=0$, see $4(0) + 2y = 10$, and correctly reduce it to $2y = 10$, but then either subtract $2$ or think $y$ must be half of $10$ (Wait, $10 \div 2$ is $5$... they actually get it right!). Wait—correction: Option C is the correct answer. 
*   **D (2.5):** The "division error." Students divide $10$ by $4$ instead of $2$ because they focus on the $4x$ coefficient.
