Having just marked a sea of these Year 9 mocks, the BIDMAS/BODMAS traps are always revealing. 

For **Problem P**, the "A" in BIDMAS (Addition before Subtraction) is the ultimate "teacher-created" trap. Students who follow the acronym literally without understanding left-to-right associativity will incorrectly insist on doing $5+6$ first. 

For **Problem Q**, the trap is simple linear reading (doing the sum as it appears from left to right), which catches those with low mathematical fluency.

**A (Left-to-Right / Left-to-Right):** This is the choice of students who have no concept of Order of Operations.
**B (Correct / Correct):** The proficient and advanced students who understand that Addition/Subtraction are equal priority and Multiplication beats Addition.
**C (Literal BIDMAS / Left-to-Right):** A rare double-error, but seen in students who are vaguely trying to remember rules but failing both.
**D (Literal BIDMAS / Correct):** This is the most common "sophisticated" error. These students know Multiplication beats Addition (Q), but they think Addition *must* come before Subtraction (P) because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym.
