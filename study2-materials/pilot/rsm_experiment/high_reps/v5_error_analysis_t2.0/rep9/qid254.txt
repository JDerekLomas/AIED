Having just marked 200 of these Year 9 scripts, the presence of the number '0' in the set is the classic "discriminator" for this topic. 

**Calculation Errors & Traps:**
*   **The Zero Trap (Option C):** This is the most common conceptual error. Students remember "divide by how many numbers there are," but instinctively discount 0 as "not a number" or "not having value," leading them to divide by 4.
*   **The Order of Operations Trap (Option B):** This catches students who know the process (add then divide) but don't understand the hierarchy of operations. They would type exactly this into a non-scientific calculator or write it linearly, not realising that BIDMAS/BODMAS means only the 7 is being divided by 5.
*   **The Correct Logic (Option A):** This tests two things: knowing 0 doesn't change the sum (so it can be omitted from the numerator) but *must* be counted in the denominator.
*   **The Overthinker (Option D):** Usually chosen by students who look for a "trick" (like the 0 must be written in the sum) or those who are completely guessing.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=40% C=40% D=5%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=3% D=2%
