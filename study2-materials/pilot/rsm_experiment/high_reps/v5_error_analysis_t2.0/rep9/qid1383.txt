In my experience marking this specific topic with Year 9 students, the difficulty lies entirely in the interaction between the negative base and the even exponent, compounded by how students use (or misuse) their calculators.

**Thinking behind the numbers:**
*   **The "Linear" Trap (B and D):** Students working below basic often confuse indices with multiplication ($3 \times 4 = 12$). Option D is particularly common for those who think "the question has a minus, so the answer must have a minus."
*   **The Calculator Trap (C):** This is the most common error for proficient students. If a student types $-3^4$ into a standard Casio calculator without brackets, it returns $-81$ (due to BIDMAS: powers before unary negation). Even "good" students forget that substitution requires brackets: $(-3)^4$.
*   **Advanced Students:** They know that any real number raised to an even power must be positive. They are the only group likely to choose A consistently.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=20% D=45%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=40% D=20%
proficient: A=45% B=5% C=45% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=0% C=8% D=0%
