To simplify $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator. The most direct method is changing $\frac{4}{x}$ to $\frac{8}{2x}$, leading to $\frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$ (Option A).

**Common Errors & Traps:**
*   **The "Add Across" Error (Option B):** Adding numerators ($3+4=7$) and adding denominators ($2x+x=3x$). This is the classic novice error.
*   **The "Double the Numerator, Ignore Denominator" Error (Option D):** Recognizing the $4$ needs doubling but failing to carry the denominator change through correctly, or simply adding $3+4$ over the larger denominator.
*   **The "Incomplete Balancing" (Option C):** Converting the first fraction incorrectly or forgetting the $2$ in the denominator.

**Student Profile Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** Almost universally apply "add across" (B) because they treat fractions as four independent integers.
*   **Basic:** They know they need a common denominator but often struggle with the algebraic $x$. They might pick D because they see "2x" as the common denominator but forget to multiply the numerator $4$ by $2$.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually remember to multiply the $4$ by $2$, landing on the correct answer A. A few might make a silly addition error or choose B if they are rushing.
*   **Advanced:** These students spot the common denominator instantly and rarely fall for the visual "add across" trap.
