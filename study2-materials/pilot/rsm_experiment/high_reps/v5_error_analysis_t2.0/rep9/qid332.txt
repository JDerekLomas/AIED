In my experience marking this specific type of algebra question, the "order of operations" in reverse (SAMDOB) is the biggest hurdle. 

**Tom's method** is the standard classroom approach: adding 5 to both sides first. This is highly intuitive. 
**Katie's method** is the "classic" mistake. Students know they need to multiply by 3 to "get rid of the fraction," but they consistently forget to multiply the -5 term as well. This error feels correct to them because the 3 is "under the $x$", so they feel they are only "un-doing" that specific part.

**Low-ability students** usually recognize Tom's +5 as "normal" but see Katie's $12 \times 3$ as plausible and "clever."
**Mid-ability students** are often suspicious of Katie because they've been drilled to "move the number without a letter first," making Tom the "safe" answer.
**High-ability students** identify that Katie's line is algebraically incorrect ($x-15=36$ would be correct) and thus choose A.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=10% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=4% D=0%
