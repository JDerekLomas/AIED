In this question, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4). Step 2 is incorrect because Isaac added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting it (the correct step would be $60 - 1 = k$, so $k = 59$).

Students working at a **below basic** level often struggle with the initial inverse operation, frequently choosing "Both incorrect" because they don't understand the relationship between the fraction bar and multiplication, or they guess "Both correct" because the numbers look "tidy."

**Basic** students are very susceptible to the trap in Step 2. They recognise Step 1 is correct, but they see "$1 + k = 60$" and intuitively perform the addition ($60 + 1$) rather than the inverse operation. This makes **C** an incredibly attractive distractor for this cohort.

**Proficient** students generally identify that Step 1 is correct, and their improved fluency in linear equations allows them to spot the sign error in Step 2. They are the group most likely to correctly select **A**.

**Advanced** students will solve the equation mentally in seconds and immediately identify that only the first step follows the laws of algebra.
