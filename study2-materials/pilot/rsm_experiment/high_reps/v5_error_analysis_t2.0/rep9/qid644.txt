To predict these percentages, I’ve drawn on years of seeing Year 9 students tackle double bracket expansion. 

The primary "trap" here is the confusion between **multiplying** terms and **combining** terms (addition/subtraction).
*   **A (+4):** The correct answer. Requires knowing $(-1) \times (-4) = +4$.
*   **B (-4):** A common sign error. Students remember $1 \times 4 = 4$ but struggle with the "negative times a negative" rule.
*   **C (+5) & D (-5):** These are the "additive" errors. Students see $-1$ and $-4$ and perform $(-1) + (-4)$ or $1+4$, forgetting that "expanding" necessitates multiplication of every term.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=12% C=1% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
