In this Year 9 mock, students find the concept of a reciprocal straightforward when the numbers are positive, but the presence of negative signs acts as a significant "distractor." Many students wrongly believe that to maintain a negative result, you need to multiply by a negative, forgetting the rule that two negatives make a positive.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option A (Correct):** The multiplicative inverse of $-3/4$ is $4/3$ because the product must be $+1$ for the negative sign on the LHS to be preserved in the result.
*   **Option B (Common Trap):** Students assume "reciprocal" means "flip the fraction and keep the sign," or they see a negative answer and instinctively reach for a negative multiplier.
*   **Option C/D:** These students confuse the operation with addition/subtraction (looking for $0$) or simply guess due to a lack of understanding of fraction multiplication.
