Having marked hundreds of these papers, the primary hurdle in this question is not the arithmetic of $3^4$, but the treatment of the negative sign. Year 9 students have a tendency to treat indices as multipliers or to misapply the "a negative and a negative make a positive" rule when it comes to powers.

The errors generally fall into these traps:
*   **A (Correct):** Students recognize that an even power of a negative number results in a positive result.
*   **B (Multiplication error):** The "Junior Classic" – students see $k$ and $4$ and perform $3 \times 4$, ignoring the index entirely.
*   **C (Negative retention):** Students calculate $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$ but assume the negative sign remains, often influenced by how they might incorrectly input it into a non-scientific calculator or by thinking "it started negative, so it stays negative."
*   **D (Combined error):** A combination of multiplying $3 \times 4$ and retaining the negative sign.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=35% D=15%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
