To predict these percentages, I’ve drawn on the common Year 9 misconceptions regarding BIDMAS/BODMAS.

**The Logic Behind the Errors:**
*   **The "Reading Left to Right" Trap (A & B):** For Problem P, many students (incorrectly) believe Addition *must* come before Subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym. However, most intuitively work left-to-right on P.
*   **The "Addition Before Multiplication" Trap (A & C):** This is the classic BIDMAS failure in Problem Q, where students simply process numbers in the order they appear.
*   **The "BIDMAS Literalist" (D):** This is the most common "mid-tier" error. A student remembers BIDMAS and sees that 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the word, so they insist $5+6$ must be done first in Problem P. This is a very "attractive" wrong answer for students who have just learned the acronym but don't understand left-to-right associativity.
