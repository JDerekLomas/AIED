In this Year 9 cohort, the primary "trap" is the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students who fail to multiply first will arrive at different incorrect answers depending on whether they work strictly left-to-right or combine numbers incorrectly.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Correct (6):** $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 + 8 = 6$.
*   **Left-to-Right (4):** $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$. This is a very common error for lower-ability students who ignore BIDMAS.
*   **Adding before Subtracting (-10):** Students who think "Addition" comes before "Subtraction" in BIDMAS often do $5 + 4 = 9$ (forgetting the negative sign or the multiplication), or more likely $3 - (5+8) = 3 - 13 = -10$.
*   **Bracket/Sign Errors (-12):** Doing $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 \times (4+2)$ or other combined arithmetic slips often lead here.
