To provide these predictions, I have considered the following pedagogical insights from marking Year 9 scripts:

*   **Option A (Correct):** High-ability students recognise the viniculuim acts as a grouping symbol.
*   **Option B (The "Miscopying" Error):** Surprisingly common among lower-ability students who feel there is a "missing term" or want to balance the expression symmetrically.
*   **Option C (The Order of Operations Error):** This is the most "attractive" trap. Students who use a calculator-style left-to-right logic often assume the division only applies to the term immediately following it, neglecting the parentheses.
*   **Option D (The Commutativity Error):** Students who know it should be a fraction but habitually put the "more complex" expression on the top or simply confuse numerator and denominator positions.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=55% B=5% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=8% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
