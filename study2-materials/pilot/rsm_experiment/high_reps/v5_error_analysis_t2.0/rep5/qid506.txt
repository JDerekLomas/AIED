Having just sat at my kitchen table for twelve hours marking two hundred of these, this is exactly the pattern of mistakes I saw. 

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A ($p = 1/4$):** The "Visual Intuition" trap. Students see 3 and 12 and immediately think "3 fits into 12 four times." This is by far the most common mistake for lower and middle-ability students who apply division but lose track of which side is being divided by what.
*   **B ($p = 1/36$):** The Correct Method. Dividing both sides by 3, or multiplying by $1/3$.
*   **C ($p = 4$):** The "Standard Format" trap. These students ignore the fraction entirely or mentally rewrite the question as $12 \div 3$, expecting a whole number answer because they are uncomfortable with fractional results.
*   **D ($p = 1/9$):** The "Arithmetic Glitch." Students often think they need to multiply 3 by something to get the denominator of the answer, but they incorrectly square the 3 or misread the 12 as a 3. It's less common than A or C.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=97% C=1% D=0%
