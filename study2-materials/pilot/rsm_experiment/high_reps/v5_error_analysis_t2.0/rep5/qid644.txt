To provide these predictions, I am focusing on three common pitfalls observed in Year 9 mock exams for this specific expansion:
1. **The Negative $\times$ Negative Trap:** Students often correctly identify the digits but struggle with sign rules, choosing $-4$.
2. **The Addition Trap:** Below-basic students frequently "collect" the numbers ($-1 - 4$) or simply add them rather than multiplying, leading to $-5$ or $+5$.
3. **Over-thinking the variables:** While this question specifically asks for the two constant terms, weaker students sometimes try to involve 'p' or second-guess the simplicity of the product.

**Prediction breakdown:**

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
*Reasoning: High incidence of the "Addition Trap" resulting in -5. They see two negatives and combine them as a debt. $-4$ is also popular as they ignore the first minus sign.*

basic: A=45% B=40% C=5% D=10%
*Reasoning: Students know they should multiply (avoiding +/- 5), but there is a roughly 50/50 split on whether they remember that a negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive.*

proficient: A=85% B=13% C=1% D=1%
*Reasoning: Most understand the sign rules, but a significant minority will make a "silly mistake" under exam pressure, recording -4 despite knowing the rule.*

advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
*Reasoning: These students will find this a "breather" question and will almost exclusively catch the double negative. The 2% accounts for pure transcription errors.*
