In this context, I am evaluating the expansion of a quadratic where the primary difficulty is managing the directed numbers (the two negative constants).

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **The "+35" vs "-35" Trap:** A very common error is thinking that "negative times negative equals negative" (especially among students who confuse the rules for adding and multiplying).
*   **The "-12" vs "-2" Trap:** Students who subtract 5 from 7 (getting 2) rather than collecting -5 and -7 (getting -12) are usually those who have a shaky grasp of the number line or try to find the "difference" between the two numbers.
*   **Attractive Wrong Answer:** **Option D** is the most common distractor because students correctly sum $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$, but then apply the "multiplication feels like it should stay negative" logic to get $-35$.

**Predicted Percentages:**

**below_basic:** A=30% B=15% C=20% D=35%
*Rationale: This group often guesses or confuses subtraction with multiplication. Option A is popular as they see "7 - 5 = 2".*

**basic:** A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
*Rationale: Most identify that 5 and 7 make 12, but they struggle significantly with the sign of the constant term (-5 x -7).*

**proficient:** A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
*Rationale: These students have mastered FOIL/Grid method. The main slip remains the final constant sign, though most now remember "two signs the same make a plus."*

**advanced:** A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
*Rationale: High-performing Year 9s rarely miss these; an error here is usually a transcription slip rather than a conceptual one.*
