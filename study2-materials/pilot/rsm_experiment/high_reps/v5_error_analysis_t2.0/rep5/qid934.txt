In this Year 9 mock, students find linear equations in the form $ax + by = c$ significantly more challenging than the standard $y = mx + c$. The substitution of $x=0$ is theoretically the easiest point to find, yet many students bypass the logic of "zeroing out" a term and instead look for patterns or misapply inverse operations.

**A (20)** is the "multiplication" trap. Students see 4, 2, and 10 and feel that because it’s a "maths" problem, they should multiply the coefficients ($2 \times 10$ or $4 \times 5$).
**B (3)** is a common "number sense" error. Students subtract 4 from 10 to get 6, then halve it, but they often do this calculation poorly or assume $x=1$ instead of $x=0$.
**C (5)** is the correct answer ($2y = 10 \implies y = 5$).
**D (2.5)** is the "division trap." Students ignore the $y$ coefficient or $x$ term and simply divide 10 by 4, which is a common reflex when they see an equation starting with $4x$.

Here is the predicted breakdown of 200 Year 9 papers:

proficient: A=5% B=10% C=75% D=10%
