To predict the performance for this question, we must look at the specific common misconception in Step 2. 

**Step 1** ($15 \times 4 = 60$) is a very high-confidence move for most students. 
**Step 2** relies on isolating $k$. The mistake made here ($60 + 1 = 61$ instead of $60 - 1 = 59$) is a classic "sign-change" error. Students often see the "+1" and instinctively add it to the other side because they are operating on autopilot, or they misremember the rule "do the opposite" and instead "do what you see."

*   **Below Basic** students often struggle with the initial multiplication or guess randomly between "everything is wrong" or "everything is right."
*   **Basic** students often perform Step 1 correctly but fall directly into the trap of Step 2 because "adding is easier than subtracting" and they aren't checking their answer by substitution ($15 = 62/4$?).
*   **Proficient** students recognize Step 1 is correct but have a high "slip" rate on Step 2; many will select Option C because 61 *feels* like a plausible result of 60 and 1.
*   **Advanced** students will substitute $k=61$ back into the original equation, realize it gives $15.5$, and correctly identify that only Step 1 is mathematically sound.
