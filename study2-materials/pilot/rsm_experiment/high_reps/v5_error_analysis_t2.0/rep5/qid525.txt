To arrive at these percentages, I have considered the following common Year 9 behaviours:

*   **Option D (The "Adder's Trap"):** This is the classic lower-ability error where students simply add the numerators ($7+1$) and the denominators ($10+4$). It feels "natural" and avoids the struggle of finding a common denominator.
*   **Option C (Partial Calculation):** This often comes from students attempting to convert to improper fractions but multiplying the denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) without adjusting the numerators correctly, or simply losing their way mid-method.
*   **Option A (The "Format Error"):** This is a high-distractor for proficient and advanced students. $\frac{99}{20}$ is the correct numerical value, but the question explicitly asks for a **mixed number**. High-ability students often rush, see the correct value, and circle it without re-reading the final instruction.
*   **Option B (The Correct Answer):** Requires the student to find the common denominator (20), convert correctly ($4 \frac{14}{20} + 4 \frac{5}{20}$ or converting to $\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4}$), and follow the formatting instruction.

basic: A=15% B=40% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=10% B=88% C=1% D=1%
