To predict these percentages, I’ve analysed the common pitfalls associated with $y = 3x^2$ when $x=0.3$:

*   **Option A ($0.81$):** This is the "BIDMAS" error of multiplying $3$ by $0.3$ first ($0.9$) and then squaring the result ($0.9^2 = 0.81$). This is the most common conceptual error in Year 9.
*   **Option B ($0.27$):** The correct answer. Requires squaring $0.3$ to get $0.09$ and then multiplying by $3$.
*   **Option C ($1.8$):** This is the "double instead of square" error. The student calculates $3 \times (0.3 \times 2) = 1.8$, common for students who struggle with index notation.
*   **Option D ($2.7$):** This is the place-value/decimal error. The student squares $0.3$ and gets $0.9$ (missing the extra decimal place), then multiplies by $3$.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=65% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=92% C=0% D=3%
