In Year 9, this specific component of binomial expansion (multiplying the constants) is a classic "sign trap" combined with "operation confusion." 

**Calculation Errors & Traps:**
*   **A (+4):** This is the correct calculation ($-1 \times -4$).
*   **B (-4):** The most common "Year 9 mistake." Students recognise it's multiplication but fall for the "a minus and a minus is a minus" misconception, or simply bring down the sign of the larger constant.
*   **C (+5):** A procedural error where the student adds the terms instead of multiplying them ($-1 + -4$ then forgetting the sign, or thinking $-1 \times -4$ is 5 because they see '1' and '4').
*   **D (-5):** The "addition trap." Students add the numbers $-1$ and $-4$. For below-basic students, any bracket operation often defaults to addition of the constant terms.

**Student Profile Analysis:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often forget that brackets imply multiplication for all four "FOIL" steps. They see -1 and -4 and intuitively add them to get -5.
*   **Basic:** They know it’s multiplication, but their grasp of directed numbers is shaky. Option B is very "attractive" because they see minus signs and feel the result must be negative.
*   **Proficient:** They usually manage the multiplication, but a significant portion will still make a "slip" on the sign, choosing B if they are rushing.
*   **Advanced:** These students have internalised "negative $\times$ negative = positive" and will see this as an easy mark, rarely falling for the addition trap.

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=75% B=20% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=1% D=0%
