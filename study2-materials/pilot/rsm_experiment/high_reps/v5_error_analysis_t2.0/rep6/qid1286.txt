In this Year 9 mock, students find the rearrangement of the sphere volume formula particularly tricky because of the fractional coefficient. Having just marked 200 of these, I observed that many students fail to "cross-multiply" the 3 correctly, and even more struggle to decide whether $\pi$ belongs in the numerator or denominator when isolating $r^3$.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A is the "Multiplication Trap":** Students know $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. To "get rid" of the $\frac{4}{3}$, many erroneously multiply everything on the right side by $V$, resulting in $4V\pi$. It looks mathematically "busy" enough to feel correct to a lower-ability student.
*   **B is the "Fraction Fumble":** Students correctly identify that $\pi$ should be on the bottom, but they invert the numerical fraction incorrectly or simply move the 4 and 3 without reciprocal logic.
*   **C is the Correct Answer:** Requires the steps $3V = 4\pi r^3 \rightarrow \frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3 \rightarrow \sqrt[3]{\text{...}}$.
*   **D is the "Partial Root":** Often chosen by students who forget that the entire expression must be under the radical, or who try to "simplify" the cube root before they've finished rearranging.
