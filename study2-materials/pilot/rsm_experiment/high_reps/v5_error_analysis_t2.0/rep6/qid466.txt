To predict these percentages, I am considering several common pitfalls:
*   **The Negative Trap:** The most common error in Year 9 is the "sign blindness" or the misconception that the star must be negative just because the other numbers are negative. Students often forget that a negative times a positive is needed to keep the result negative.
*   **Reciprocal vs. Same Number:** Lower ability students often think multiplying a number by itself (D) or its positive version (C) results in 1, rather than understanding the property of the multiplicative inverse.
*   **Attractive Wrong Answer (B):** This is the biggest "distractor." Students correctly identify that they need the reciprocal ($4/3$) but "over-correct" by adding a minus sign, thinking that since everything else is negative, the answer should be too.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=45% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=25% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
