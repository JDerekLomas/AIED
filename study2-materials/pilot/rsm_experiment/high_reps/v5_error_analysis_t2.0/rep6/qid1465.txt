In this Year 9 mock, students frequently trip over the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS) and the rules of directed numbers.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A (6):** The correct answer ($4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 + 8$). This requires holding the $-2$ in memory while adding $8$.
*   **B (4):** A "pseudo-correct" calculation where students do $3 - 5$ to get $-2$, then see $+4$ and get $+2$, then multiply by $2$. 
*   **C (-12):** The most common procedural error (Left-to-Right bias). Students ignore BIDMAS entirely: $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$ (leading to B) OR they mistakenly sum everything first then multiply, but specifically: $(3 - 5 + 4) \times 2$ results in $4$ if done correctly, but many perform $3 - (5+4) \times 2$ or similar variations. Actually, **D** and **C** are often the results of doing the addition $5+4$ first (due to the 'A' coming before 'S' in BIDMAS).
*   **D (-10):** A classic BIDMAS trap. Students see 'Addition' before 'Subtraction' in the acronym, so they do $5 + 4 = 9$ first. Then $3 - 9 = -6$, and then multiply (which is wrong), OR they do $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $5 + 8 = 13$, then $3 - 13 = -10$. This is a very "attractive" mistake for middle-attaining students who over-apply the acronym.
