To determine the correct value, the student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$ (Option C)

**The Traps:**
*   **Option A (4.25):** The most common conceptual error. Students correctly calculate $6 \times 0.5 = 3$, but they see the minus sign in $10x - 3$ and subtract it from 30 ($27$) rather than adding it ($33$). $27 \div 10 = 2.7$ (Option D), but wait—often they do $10x = 30$ then incorrectly add the $6 \times 0.5$ later or involve the $6y$ as a positive. A very common error is $30 \div 6 = 5 \div 10...$ actually, Option A often comes from treating $y$ as $x$ and solving $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y = -4.16...$ but rounded/guessed. More likely, A is chosen by those who think the answer "should" be a fraction or who miscalculate $33/10$ through long division.
*   **Option D (2.7):** This is the "high-ability trap." The student sets up the equation $10x - 3 = 30$ but fails the balancing step, doing $30 - 3$ instead of $30 + 3$. This is incredibly common under exam pressure.
*   **Option B (-4.25):** Usually a wild guess or a sign error during the $10(0.5)$ substitution flip.

**Student Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will mistake the $y$ row for the $x$ row or simply guess.
*   **Basic:** Will struggle with the two-step equation nature; many will see the minus sign in the original equation and intuitively think "subtraction," leading to 2.7.
*   **Proficient:** Should manage the substitution but the "30 minus 3" error (D) remains very attractive.
*   **Advanced:** Will almost all rearrange correctly, though a small percentage will make a "silly" arithmetic slip.
