Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on typical UK Year 9 performance and common misconceptions regarding BIDMAS/BODMAS.

### Marking Reflection:
*   **The Trap (Option D):** This is the most "attractive" error. Students who are taught BODMAS/BIDMAS as a rigid hierarchy often believe **A**ddition must always come before **S**ubtraction because 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym. This leads them to mistakenly believe $5+6$ must be done first in Problem P.
*   **The Left-to-Right Habit (Option A):** Weaker students tend to ignore order of operations entirely and simply work left-to-right regardless of the operators involved.
*   **The Proficiency Gap:** Proficient students understand that multiplication precedes addition (Problem Q), but many still stumble on the Addition/Subtraction tie-break rule (left-to-right) for Problem P. Only the "advanced" group consistently knows that + and - have equal priority.
