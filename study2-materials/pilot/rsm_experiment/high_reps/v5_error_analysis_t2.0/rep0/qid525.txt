To predict these percentages, I have evaluated the likely pitfalls for Year 9 students:
*   **The Trap (Option D):** Adding the numerators and denominators ($7+1$ and $10+4$) is the most common error for low-ability students who view fractions as two separate integers.
*   **The Formatting Error (Option A):** These students know how to calculate correctly (usually by converting to improper fractions first) but fail to follow the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
*   **The Calculation Slip (Option C):** Usually results from multiplying the denominators together ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but forgetting to scale the numerators correctly, or simply getting the denominator wrong while working toward an improper fraction.
*   **The Mastery (Option B):** Finding a common denominator (20) and correctly adding the integer parts and fraction parts ($4 + \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20}$).
