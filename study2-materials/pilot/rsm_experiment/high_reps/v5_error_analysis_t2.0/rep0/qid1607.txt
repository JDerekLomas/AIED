To predict these percentages, I’ve looked at the common misconceptions surrounding multi-step linear equations.

**Step 1** is correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$).
**Step 2** is incorrect because the student added 1 to both sides instead of subtracting it ($60 = 1 + k$ should lead to $60 - 1 = k$).

*   **Below Basic** students often struggle with the "inverse" concept. Many see a '1' and a '60' and instinctively add them to get 61, without realizing they have successfully performed Step 1. Many will pick **C** because 61 "looks" like the right number result for those digits.
*   **Basic** students usually recognize that $15 \times 4 = 60$. However, "Inverse Error" is the most common mistake at this level. They often see $+1$ and move it to the other side as a $+1$ again, leading them to think both steps are correct (**C**).
*   **Proficient** students are the "trap" victims. They know Step 1 is right, but they often work too quickly through Step 2. If they are slightly careless, they agree with Isaac's logic ($60+1=61$) and choose **C**. If they are focused, they spot the sign error and choose **A**.
*   **Advanced** students instinctively solve the equation $k=59$ before looking at the steps. They immediately spot the additive inverse error in Step 2.
