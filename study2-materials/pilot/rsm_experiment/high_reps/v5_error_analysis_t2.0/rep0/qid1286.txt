To predict these results, I have considered the following common Year 9 pitfalls:

1.  **Rearranging Fraught with Danger:** The $4/3$ is the biggest hurdle. Many students struggle with "dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal." This makes **A** very attractive to those who think the $4\pi/3$ simply moves as a whole unit to the other side.
2.  **Order of Operations:** Students often apply the cube root only to the $V$ (or forget it entirely), leading to distractors like **D**, where the algebra gets "muddled" during the transition from $r^3$ to $r$.
3.  **The Formula Burden:** In a mock, many "Below Basic" students won't even recall that $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ correctly, often confusing it with the surface area formula or getting the power of $r$ wrong, leading to "stab in the dark" guessing.
4.  **Proficient vs. Advanced:** Proficient students usually remember the formula but frequently flip the fraction incorrectly ($4/3$ becomes $4/3$ on the other side). Advanced students are the only group likely to consistently multiply by 3 and divide by $4\pi$.

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=25% B=15% C=55% D=05%
advanced: A=05% B=02% C=92% D=01%
