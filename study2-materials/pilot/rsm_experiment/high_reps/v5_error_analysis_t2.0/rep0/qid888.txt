To predict these percentages, I’ve considered the following common Year 9 misconceptions:

*   **Option B (Correct):** Students must correctly manage two negative signs ($ -5 - 7 = -12 $ and $ -5 \times -7 = +35 $).
*   **Option D (The "Signs" Trap):** This is the most common error for middle-ability students. They successfully add $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$, but then apply the "minus and minus" rule incorrectly, or simply forget that a negative times a negative is a positive for the final term.
*   **Option A (The "Difference" Error):** Common among lower-ability students who subtract 5 from 7 to get 2 (often $ -5 + 7 $) instead of adding the two negatives.
*   **Option C (The "Ignore Signs" Error):** Students who treat the problem as $(m+5)(m+7)$, essentially ignoring the operation signs entirely.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
