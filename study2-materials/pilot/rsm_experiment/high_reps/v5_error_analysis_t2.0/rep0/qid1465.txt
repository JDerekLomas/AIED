To arrive at these predictions, I have considered the standard BIDMAS/priority of operations pitfalls that Year 9 students face.

**Error Analysis:**
*   **Correct (A):** Multiply first ($4 \times 2 = 8$), then handle addition/subtraction left-to-right ($3 - 5 = -2$; $-2 + 8 = 6$).
*   **The "Linear" Trap (B):** Solving purely left-to-right ignoring priority $(3 - 5 = -2$; $-2 + 4 = 2$; $2 \times 2 = 4$). This is the most common error for mid-to-low ability students.
*   **The "Addition First" Trap (D):** Misinterpreting BIDMAS as "Addition always before Subtraction" ($5 + 8 = 13$, then $3 - 13 = -10$).
*   **The "Negative Blindness" Trap (C):** Combining the Linear trap with a sign error or treating the sum as $(3 - 5 + 4) \times 2$ but incorrectly calculating the bracket as something like $-6$.
