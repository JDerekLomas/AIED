To solve $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator. Multiplying the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$ gives $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

**Teacher's Analysis of Mistakes:**
*   **Option A (Correct):** Requires finding the common denominator ($2x$) and correctly doubling the numerator of the second fraction.
*   **Option B (The "Add Everything" Error):** A classic misconception where students add the numerators ($3+4$) and add the denominators ($2x+x$). This is extremely common among lower-attaining students.
*   **Option C (The "Ignore the 2" Error):** Students recognize the $x$, but simply add $3+8$ and put it over $x$, or multiply everything by 2 and forget to keep the denominator consistent.
*   **Option D (The "Only Add Numerators" Error):** Students recognize they need a common denominator but fail to adjust the numerator of the second fraction ($3/2x + 4/2x$).
