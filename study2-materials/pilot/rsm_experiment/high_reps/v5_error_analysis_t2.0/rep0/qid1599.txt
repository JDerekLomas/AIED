In marking this particular question across 200 papers, I’ve found it is less about "doing the maths" and more about the student's familiarity with the visual grammar of algebra.

**Diagnostic notes:**
*   **The Trap (D):** This is the most common conceptual error. Students remember that division becomes a fraction, but they struggle with "left-to-right" order, often placing the larger expression on top or simply reversing them because "it looks more like a proper fraction."
*   **The BODMAS error (C):** Students who think the bracket "doesn't matter" or just see a string of symbols often assume only the $h$ is being divided.
*   **The Copying error (B):** This usually comes from students who are "pattern matching" rather than calculating; they see a +4 on the right and assume there must be a +4 on the left to "balance" it.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=5% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=75% B=2% C=8% D=15%
advanced: A=96% B=0% C=1% D=3%
