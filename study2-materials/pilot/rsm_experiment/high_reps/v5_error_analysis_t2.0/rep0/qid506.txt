Having marked hundreds of these papers, this specific question is a classic "fraction trap." Students often see the 3 and the 12 and immediately think of the relationship $3 \times 4 = 12$, regardless of where the numbers sit in the fraction.

**Teacher's breakdown of errors:**
*   **A ($p=1/4$):** The most common error. Students simply divide 12 by 3 to get 4 and keep it in the denominator. They are ignoring the inverse operation rule and focusing on number bonds.
*   **B (Correct):** Students understand they must divide both sides by 3, which is the same as multiplying the denominator by 3 ($\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{36}$).
*   **C ($p=4$):** Common for below-basic students who "move" the 3 across, ignore the fraction, and simply calculate $12 \div 3$.
*   **D ($p=1/9$):** A rarer error where students confusedly subtract 3 from 12 or try to "balance" it by squaring 3.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=55% B=25% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=30% B=65% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=5% B=94% C=1% D=0%
