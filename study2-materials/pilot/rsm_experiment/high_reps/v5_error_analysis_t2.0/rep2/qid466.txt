To get a result of $-1$ when multiplying by $-\frac{3}{4}$, the student must identify that they need the **reciprocal** and that the result must be **positive**, meaning the star must be a positive fraction ($-\text{ve} \times +\text{ve} = -\text{ve}$).

**Common errors found in these 200 papers:**
*   **The "Reciprocal Only" Trap (B):** This is the most common error. Students remember the "flip it" rule for getting 1, but forget that a negative times a negative produces a positive. They see the negative in the question and instinctively pick the negative reciprocal to "match" it.
*   **The "Inverse Operation" Confusion (C/D):** Lower-ability students often confuse multiplication by a fraction with simple addition/subtraction. They see $-\frac{3}{4}$ and think the answer must be the additive inverse ($\frac{3}{4}$) to get back to zero, or simply repeat the number in the question (D) out of confusion.
*   **The Identity Error (A):** Proficient students usually recognise that $x \times \frac{1}{x} = 1$. The only hurdle is the sign. Advanced students rarely miss the sign flip required to maintain the negative product.
