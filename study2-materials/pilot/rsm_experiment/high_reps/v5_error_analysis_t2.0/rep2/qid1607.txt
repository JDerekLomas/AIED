In this common Year 9 linear equations question, the primary hurdle is Step 2. While students are generally proficient at "undoing" a division by multiplying, the "change the side, change the sign" rule often lapses into "change the side, change the operation to the one I've just been doing" or simply failing to recognise that 1 must be subtracted from 60.

**Analysis of Errors:**
- **Step 1:** Most students recognise $15 \times 4 = 60$. Errors here are usually arithmetic ($15 \times 4 = 45$ or $70$) rather than conceptual.
- **Step 2 (The Trap):** To solve $60 = 1 + k$, many students subconsciously want to keep "adding" because they just did a multiplication that increased the number. They see the $+1$ and instinctively add it to $60$ to get $61$, ignoring that the inverse of addition is subtraction.
- **A (Only Step 1):** This is the correct answer. Proficient students see the mistake in Step 2.
- **C (Both Correct):** The most common distractor. Students check Step 1, see it’s right, glance at Step 2 and think "60 and 1 makes 61," without checking the algebraic logic.
