To predict these percentages, I have evaluated the common misconceptions regarding the multiplication of negative numbers and the confusion between operations (multiplication vs. addition) prevalent in Year 9.

**Calculation Errors and Student Profiles:**
*   **The Multiplicative Negative Error (Option B):** Many students correctly identify that $1 \times 4 = 4$ but have a shaky grasp of "negative times a negative." They often think, "There are minus signs here, so the answer is minus."
*   **The Additive Error (Options C and D):** This is an extremely common "Year 9 Mock" trap. Under time pressure, students see $-1$ and $-4$ and *add* them to get $-5$ or subtract to get $+5$, forgetting they are in the process of "expanding" (multiplying). 
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle to distinguish between FOIL/grid multiplication and simple addition of directed numbers. D is very attractive to them.
*   **Basic/Proficient:** These students know they should multiply, but "minus times minus" remains a coin flip. Option B is the primary distractor for them.
*   **Advanced:** These students will accurately apply the rules of signs but must avoid a "silly" cognitive slip of adding the numbers by mistake.

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=75% B=20% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
