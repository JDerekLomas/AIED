In this common "variable in the denominator" question, the primary cognitive trap is the "reversal error." Many students see the numbers 10 and 5 and instinctively perform the division $10 \div 5$, assuming that because the answer is on the left, the division must work in that direction.

- **Error A ($p=0.5$):** The correct answer ($5 \div 10$). Students reach this if they successfully rearrange to $10p = 5$ and divide correctly.
- **Error B ($p=50$):** The "multiplication" error. Students see a fraction and know they need to get rid of it, so they multiply the visible numbers ($10 \times 5$). 
- **Error C ($p=2$):** The most "attractive" trap. Students read the equation as "10, 5, $p$" and calculate $10 \div 5 = 2$. They essentially solve $p = 10 \div 5$ rather than $10 = 5 \div p$.
- **Error D:** Chosen by students who find the "smaller number divided by larger number" counter-intuitive or believe it is an "impossible" division.
