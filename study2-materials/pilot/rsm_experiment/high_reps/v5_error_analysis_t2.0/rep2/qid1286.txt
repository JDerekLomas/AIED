In this Year 9 mock, students find the rearrangement of the sphere volume formula notoriously difficult. Many struggle with the "inverse operations" order, particularly when dealing with the fraction $4/3$.

*   **Error Analysis for A:** Students correctly multiply by 4 and $\pi$ because they are in the numerator of the formula, failing to realise that to move them to the other side, they must divide. This is the most common "mirroring" error.
*   **Error Analysis for B:** Students successfully divide by $\pi$ but apply the $4/3$ incorrectly, often multiplying by $4$ then dividing by $3$ out of habit, resulting in the $4$ staying in the numerator.
*   **Error Analysis for D:** A classic algebraic mistake where the cube root is applied only to the $V$, while the constants are moved outside the radical or treated as a simple coefficient.

Here are my predicted percentages based on marking similar papers:

below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=30% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=25% C=50% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=8% C=88% D=2%
