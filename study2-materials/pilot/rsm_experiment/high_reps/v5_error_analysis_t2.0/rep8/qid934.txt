To determine the distribution of answers, I’ve considered the following common Year 9 misconceptions:
*   **The "Pattern Maker" (Option A):** Many lower-ability students don't substitute; they look for a number that "fits" a sequence. Seeing 4, 10, and 2, they multiply 4 by 5 or think in multiples of 10.
*   **The "Additive Error" (Option B):** Students calculate $4(0) = 0$, then see $2y = 10$. Instead of dividing, they subtract 2 from 10 or perform $10 \div 2$ but then subtract some other perceived constant, or they simply guess a number that looks "right" for a coordinate geometry problem. Actually, $B=3$ is most commonly chosen by students who substitute $x=1$ incorrectly into the next box and slide the answer across, or confuse the coefficients.
*   **The "Substitution Success" (Option C):** This is the correct answer ($0 + 2y = 10 \rightarrow y = 5$).
*   **The "Linear Divider" (Option D):** These students correctly identify $4x=0$ but then divide the wrong way around ($10 \div 4$) or assume the first value must be the "gradient" related or a fraction.

Here is the predicted percentage distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=55% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%
