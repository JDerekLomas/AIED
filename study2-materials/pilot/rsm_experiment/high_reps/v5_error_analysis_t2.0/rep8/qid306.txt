Having just marked a sea of these Year 9 mocks, the BIDMAS/BODMAS traps are always telling. 

In **Problem P**, the "A comes before S" (Addition before Subtraction) rule is the most common misconception. Students often think they *must* add $5+6$ before dealing with the $4$. This leads many to think D is correct. 

In **Problem Q**, the lure of working left-to-right is the main enemy. Lower-ability students treat the calculator-less brain as a simple linear processor. 

Here is how those 200 papers usually shake out:

below_basic: A=45% B=5% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
