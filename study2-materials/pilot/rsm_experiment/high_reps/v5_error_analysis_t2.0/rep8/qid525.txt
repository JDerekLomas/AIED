To arrive at these predictions, I have considered the following common pitfalls:

*   **Option D (The "Top and Bottom" Error):** This is the most "attractive" distractor for below-basic students. They add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), then add the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$). It feels intuitive but ignores the logic of equivalent fractions.
*   **Option A (The Improper Conversion):** This appeals to proficient students who follow the "rule" of converting to improper fractions first ($\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54+45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$). However, the question specifically asks for a **mixed number**. These students lose a mark for failing to read the final instruction.
*   **Option C (Denominator Miscalculation):** A common error where students find a common denominator by multiplying $10 \times 4 = 40$, but then fail to scale the numerators correctly, or simply get lost in the arithmetic and pick the answer with the "big" denominator.
*   **Option B (Correct):** This requires finding a common denominator (usually 20), converting the fractional parts correctly ($\frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20}$), and combining with the whole numbers.
