Having marked 200 of these scripts, this question highlights the common friction point between procedural confidence and reading comprehension. Many Year 9s can add fractions, but the instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number" is a significant hurdle for those who have been drilled to convert everything to improper fractions first.

**Diagnostic thinking:**
*   **A is the correct answer.** It is reachable by adding wholes and parts ($2+1=3$ and $1/5+2/5=3/5$).
*   **B is numerically correct but functionally wrong** as it ignores the "mixed number" instruction. Students who convert to improper fractions to calculate ($11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$) often forget to convert back. This is an "advanced/proficient" trap.
*   **C is the "below basic" trap.** These students add the numerators AND the denominators ($11+7=18$ and $5+5=10$, or more simply $3$ and $3/10$ but making an error in logic).
*   **D is the "basic" trap.** These students add the whole numbers ($2+1=3$) and the numerators ($1+2=3$), but then add the denominators ($5+5=10$). This is the classic additive misconception.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=45% D=25%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=75% B=20% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=92% B=7% C=1% D=0%
