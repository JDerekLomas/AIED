Having just sat at my desk marking 200 of these, this specific question is a classic "separator" for Year 9. Many students see the 3 and the 12 and immediately hunt for a 4 or a 36 without considering the structure of the fraction.

**The Logic of the Errors:**
*   **A ($1/4$):** The most common mistake. Students "see" the relationship $12 \div 3 = 4$ and assume the answer must be $1/4$ because there is a fraction in the question. They effectively treat it as $p = 12 \div 3$ and put it back over 1.
*   **B ($1/36$):** The correct answer. Requires the student to multiply both sides by $1/3$ or divide by 3, recognising that $12 \times 3$ happens in the denominator.
*   **C ($4$):** Common among "Below Basic" students who ignore the fraction entirely and simply solve $12 \div 3$ as if the equation were $3p = 12$.
*   **D ($1/9$):** A rarer calculation error where students subtract or somehow relate the 3 and 12 incorrectly, or try to find a common denominator unnecessarily.

**The Predicted Stats:**
