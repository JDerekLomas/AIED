In marking this question, I've observed that "Below Basic" students struggle with the visual translation of operations, often losing parts of the expression or misplacing terms. "Basic" students understand that a fraction bar replaces the division symbol but are frequently caught out by "operation priority" errors or the common "left-to-right" reading trap (leading to Option D). "Proficient" students generally understand the notation but may still lapse into Option C if they are working too quickly and fail to treat the bracket as a grouping mechanism.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=55% B=5% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=0% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
