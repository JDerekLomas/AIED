In this context, I am looking at a classic quadratic expansion involving two negative signs within the brackets, which is a notorious "sign trap" for Year 9 students.

**Error Analysis:**
*   **B is correct:** $(-5) + (-7) = -12$ and $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$.
*   **A is a "difference" error:** The student adds the digits $7$ and $5$ but treats one as a positive, resulting in $-2$. Alternatively, they confuse the rule for adding/subtracting with multiplication rules.
*   **C is a "sign flip" error:** The student knows $5$ and $7$ make $12$ and $35$, but ignores the negative signs entirely or assumes "two minuses make a plus" applies to the middle term addition too.
*   **D is the "multiplication sign" error:** This is the most common trap for average students. They correctly calculate $-5 - 7 = -12$ for the middle term, but then incorrectly calculate $-5 \times -7 = -35$, forgetting that a negative times a negative is a positive.

**Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often pick A or C; they struggle with the basic concept of FOIL/Grid method and often guess based on the numbers appearing in the question.
*   **Basic:** Mostly fall for D. They are proficient enough to add $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$, but consistently fail the sign rule for the constant term.
*   **Proficient:** Generally get it right (B), but under exam pressure, about 15-20% will still make a "silly" sign error and slip into D.
*   **Advanced:** Almost always get B. If they get it wrong, it’s usually due to extreme haste (A).

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
