To predict these percentages, I’ve considered the following common Year 9 misconceptions:

*   **Tom's method (+5 to both sides):** This is the standard first step taught in most UK classrooms. It feels "safe" and is the most common successful approach.
*   **Katie's method (×3 to both sides):** This is the "attractive nuisance." Students often forget that if they multiply by 3, they must multiply *every* term, including the $-5$. Many students see the $\div3$ and want to "undo" it immediately without respecting the priority of operations or the distributive law.
*   **Below Basic/Basic:** These students often struggle with the "order of operations in reverse" for equations. They are very likely to think Katie is correct because "you have to get rid of the fraction first."
*   **Proficient:** These students have mastered the $+5$ step but often still fall for Katie’s trap because $12 \times 3 = 36$ looks "mathematically neat," even though it ignores the $-5$.
*   **Advanced:** These students recognise that Katie has failed to multiply the constant term by 3 (which would result in $x - 15 = 36$).
