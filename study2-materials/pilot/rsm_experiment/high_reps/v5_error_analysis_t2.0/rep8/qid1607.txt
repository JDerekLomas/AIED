In this equation, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4). Step 2 is incorrect because the student added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting it. 

The most common error for Year 9 students is "inverse operations confusion." In Step 2, students see a "+1" and instinctively think they need to add to get the final answer, especially if they are rushing or lack fluency with rearranging. "Both steps are correct" is a very attractive trap for students who check the arithmetic but not the logic of the operation.

**Calculation Errors:**
*   **B & D:** These are rare; most students recognise that $15 \times 4 = 60$.
*   **C (The Trap):** Students perform $60 + 1$ instead of $60 - 1$. They see the $1$ and the $60$ and assume the "total" must be $61$.
*   **A (Correct):** Students identify that the second step used the wrong inverse operation.
