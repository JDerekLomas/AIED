In this Year 9 mock, rearranging the sphere volume formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ is a classic test of algebraic manipulation. 

**Distractor Analysis:**
*   **A ($ \sqrt[3]{\frac{4V\pi}{3}} $):** This is the most common error for students who lack confidence with fractions. They simply "move" all the terms to the $V$ side without performing inverse operations, treating it as a string of symbols.
*   **B ($ \sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}} $):** This appeals to students who remember they need to divide by $\pi$, but get the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ upside down during the transposition. It looks "neat" because the 4 remains on top with the $V$.
*   **C (Correct):** To get here, the student must multiply by 3, divide by $4\pi$, and then take the cube root.
*   **D ($ \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4\pi} $):** This catches students who understand the inverse operations but apply them in the wrong order or fail to extend the radical over the whole expression.
