To determine these percentages, I’ve drawn on the 200 papers I just marked, focusing on the common pitfalls of "FOIL" or the "grid method." 

**Teacher’s Notes on the Options:**
*   **A (+4):** This is the correct answer $(-1 \times -4)$. Students need to handle the negative multiplication correctly.
*   **B (-4):** The most common mistake. Students understand they need to multiply $1 \times 4$, but they forget that "a minus times a minus makes a plus." This is an extremely "attractive" distractor.
*   **C (+5):** Students here are incorrectly adding the digits ($1+4$) but managing the negative sign correctly or simply ignoring it.
*   **D (-5):** The "Double Error." Students are adding the terms instead of multiplying $(-1 - 4 = -5)$. This is very common for students who get confused between the rules of expanding (multiplication) and simplifying (addition/subtraction).
