In this question, the common pitfalls involve the misunderstanding of reciprocal operations. Students at lower levels frequently default to "Big number divided by Small number" ($10 \div 5$) or assume the operation is multiplication because of the fractional appearance ($10 \times 5$). 

The most common wrong answer, **C**, comes from the "intuitive" $10 \div 5$. The second most common, **B**, comes from treating the equation as $p/5 = 10$. Students often struggle when the variable is in the denominator.

**Specific errors:**
*   **A (Correct):** Requires isolating $p$ by multiplying both sides by $p$ ($10p = 5$) then dividing by $10$ ($p = 5/10$).
*   **B (50):** Incorrectly rearranging as $p = 10 \times 5$. This is the classic "operation swap" without regard for position.
*   **C (2):** Solving as if the question were $p = 10 \div 5$. This is highly attractive to basic learners because 10 and 5 have a clean integer relationship.
*   **D:** Chosen by students who feel a "smaller number can't be divided to make a larger number."
