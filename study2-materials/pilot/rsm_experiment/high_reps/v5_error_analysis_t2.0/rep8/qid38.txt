To solve $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator. The most direct method is changing $\frac{4}{x}$ into $\frac{8}{2x}$. Adding the numerators gives $\frac{11}{2x}$ (Option A).

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** This is the classic "add across" error ($3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$). This is the most common error for students who lack a conceptual understanding of fractions.
*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** This is a partial mastery error. The student identifies $2x$ as the common denominator but forgets to multiply the second numerator by 2. They simply add $3+4$ over the denominator they chose.
*   **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** A rare processing error where a student might multiply the first term by $1/2$ incorrectly or mess up the denominator after finding the correct numerator.
