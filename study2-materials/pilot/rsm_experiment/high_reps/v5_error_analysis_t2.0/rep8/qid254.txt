Having just sat at my desk marking 200 of these, this is a classic "gotcha" question that tests two distinct things: the handling of zero in averages and the understanding of BIDMAS/order of operations.

Here is the breakdown of the pitfalls:
*   **The Zero Trap (C):** Students often think "zero doesn't count" and divide by 4. This is the most common error for those who know the *mechanism* of the mean but not the *definition*.
*   **The BIDMAS Trap (B):** This looks "correct" as a linear sentence, but mathematically it is $7 \div 5$ added to the rest. Weaker students read left-to-right and ignore the lack of brackets.
*   **The Stealth Success (A):** Since $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$ is the same as $1 + 3 + 4 + 7$, this is mathematically correct. Students who are mathematically cautious often doubt this because the zero isn't visible in the numerator.
*   **The Overthinker (D):** Usually chosen by students who see that the 0 is missing from the numerator of A and think "therefore it must be wrong."
