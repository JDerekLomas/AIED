In this Year 9 mock, this question specifically tests the understanding of powers and the treatment of negative bases. Having marked hundreds of these, I know that even high-ability students can be tripped up by their calculators if they don't use brackets, or by "fast processing" where they simplify $3 \times 4$ instead of $3^4$.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

**Thinking behind the errors:**
*   **B & D (12 and -12):** This is the classic "multiplication instead of exponentiation" error ($3 \times 4$). This is the go-to guess for lower-ability students who find index notation intimidating.
*   **C (-81):** This is the most "attractive" trap. It comes from the logical (but incorrect) assumption that a negative input results in a negative output, or from entering $-3^4$ into a scientific calculator without brackets.
*   **A (81):** The correct answer ($(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$).

**Predicted results:**

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=5% D=0%
