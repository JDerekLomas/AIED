To predict these percentages, I’ve analysed the common misconceptions associated with squaring decimals and the order of operations ($BIDMAS/BODMAS$):

*   **Option B (0.27) is the correct answer.** $0.3^2 = 0.09$, and $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.
*   **Option D (2.7)** is the most common "strong student" error. They correctly calculate $3 \times 3^2$ but place the decimal point by intuition rather than calculation ($3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ or $0.3 \times 9 = 2.7$).
*   **Option C (1.8)** is the classic $BIDMAS$ error. Students multiply $3 \times 0.3$ first to get $0.9$, then square it to get $0.81$ (which leads to A), or more commonly, they do $(3 \times 0.3) \times 2$ (doubling instead of squaring).
*   **Option A (0.81)** stems from $(3 \times 0.3)^2$.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=1% B=94% C=0% D=5%
