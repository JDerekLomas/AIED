To arrive at these predictions, I’ve considered several common Year 9 misconceptions:
*   **The Sign Trap:** This is the biggest hurdle. Students know that a number times its reciprocal equals 1, but many forget that a negative times a negative is required to produce a positive product—or in this case, a negative times a *positive* is required to maintain the negative result. Option B is a classic "sign-blindness" error.
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative Inverse:** Below-basic students often confuse "inverse" (reciprocal) with "opposite" (changing the sign), leading them to pick C or D.
*   **Verification:** Advanced students will mentally perform $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -\frac{12}{12} = -1$ to confirm. Proficient students often work it out but are prone to a "double negative" confusion midway through their working.

Here are the predicted percentages for the 200 papers marked:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=20% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=96% B=4% C=0% D=0%
