Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on typical Year 9 mock exam performance and common misconceptions regarding BIDMAS (order of operations).

### Teacher’s Analysis:
*   **The Problem P Trap:** This is where many students fail. They learn BIDMAS (or BODMAS) and see that 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction). Many "Basic" and "Proficient" students will mistakenly think they *must* add $5+6$ before subtracting from $4$, whereas addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be done left-to-right.
*   **The Problem Q Trap:** This is the classic order of operations test. Most Year 9s know "multiplication before addition," but the "Below Basic" group will still instinctively work left-to-right because it's the natural reading direction.
*   **Attractive Errors:** Option D is the "hyper-correction" trap. Students who have just memorised the acronym but don't understand the "equal priority" rule will pick D, thinking they are being clever by following the letters of BIDMAS literally.

### Predicted Results:

**below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%**
*(These students largely work left-to-right for both problems, represented by Option A. If they have a vague memory of BIDMAS, they might guess C.)*

**basic: A=20% B=30% C=15% D=35%**
*(The largest group here falls for the D trap—applying the "Addition before Subtraction" rule literally while correctly identifying multiplication comes first in Q.)*

**proficient: A=10% B=65% C=5% D=20%**
*(Most have mastered that $\times$ comes before $+$, but a significant portion still gets tripped up by the equal priority of $+$ and $-$ in Problem P.)*

**advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%**
*(Top-end students recognize that $4-5+6$ is worked left-to-right and that BIDMAS/BODMAS is a simplified mnemonic for priority levels.)*

**Summary for marking report:**
below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=65% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
