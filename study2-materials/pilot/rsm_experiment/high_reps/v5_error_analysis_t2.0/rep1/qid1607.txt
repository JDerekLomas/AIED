Having marked 200 of these scripts, I can tell you that the most common pitfall here is the "inverse operation autopilot." In Step 1, students correctly identify the need to multiply by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). In Step 2, however, they see the "$1+$" and their brain tells them to move the 1 over; instead of subtracting it from 60, they instinctively add it ($60 + 1 = 61$).

Students at the lower end often assume that if a student's work is presented in a formal "Step 1, Step 2" format, it is likely to be correct. Higher-ability students are much quicker to spot that $61 + 1$ divided by 4 doesn't equal 15.
