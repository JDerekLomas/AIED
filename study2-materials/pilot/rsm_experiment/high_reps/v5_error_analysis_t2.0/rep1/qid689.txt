In this question, the main hurdle is the placement of the variable $p$ in the denominator. Year 9 students often rely on "intuitive arithmetic" rather than formal algebraic manipulation ($p = \frac{5}{10}$).

**Specific Errors:**
*   **$p=2$ (Option C):** This is the most "attractive" trap. Students see the numbers 10 and 5 and perform the division in the easiest direction ($10 \div 5$). At the **Basic** level, they simply ignore the structure of the fraction.
*   **$p=50$ (Option B):** Students recognise they need to multiply to "get rid of the fraction" but fail to divide afterwards, essentially treating it as $\frac{p}{5} = 10$.
*   **$p=0.5$ (Option A):** This is the correct answer ($\frac{5}{10}$). Only students with a **Proficient** or **Advanced** grasp of inverse operations realize the $p$ and $10$ effectively swap places.

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will choose C because "10 divided by 5 is 2." Some will choose D because they think you can't divide a smaller number by a larger number to get a whole number.
*   **Basic:** The vast majority will fall for the "C" trap ($10/5$). They are used to $x$ being on top.
*   **Proficient:** Many will correctly compute $5/10$ but a significant minority will still lapse into $10/5$ or accidentally multiply to get 50.
*   **Advanced:** Most will mentally rearrange to $10p = 5$ and solve accurately, though "silly" errors towards C can still occur under exam pressure.
