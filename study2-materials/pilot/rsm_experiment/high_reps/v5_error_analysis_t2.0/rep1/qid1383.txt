Having marked hundreds of these Year 9 algebra scripts, the primary "boss level" challenge here isn't the index notation itself, but the interaction between powers and negative signs. 

The common pitfalls are:
1. **The Arithmetic Slip (B and D):** These students see the 4 and the 3 and simply multiply them ($3 \times 4 = 12$). This is extremely common in the "below basic" tier where "power of" hasn't yet been distinguished from "multiply by."
2. **The "Odd/Even" Trap (C):** This is the most "attractive" wrong answer for mid-range students. They correctly calculate $3^4 = 81$, but they assume that if the base is negative, the answer must remain negative. They fail to track the "even number of negatives cancel out" rule.
3. **The Calculator Dependency:** Many students will type $-3^4$ into a scientific calculator without brackets. The calculator follows BIDMAS, does $3^4$ first, then applies the negative, giving $-81$. Even proficient students often trust the screen over their logic.

Here is the predicted distribution based on standard UK Year 9 performance:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
