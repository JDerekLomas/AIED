In this Year 9 mock, students find rearanging formulae involving fractions and powers particularly challenging. The common "traps" involve misunderstanding how to isolate $r^3$ (often incorrectly multiplying by the 4 or dividing by the 3) and failing to apply the cube root to the entire expression.

**Error Analysis:**
*   **Option A:** This is a very "attractive" wrong answer for students who remember there is a 4, a 3, and a $\pi$, but treat the division as a multiplication when moving terms to the other side (multiplying by 4 and $\pi$).
*   **Option B:** Students get the fraction inverted, or mistakenly think $\pi$ stays on the bottom while the 4 and 3 stay in their original vertical positions relative to each other.
*   **Option C:** **Correct.**
*   **Option D:** A "shallow" rearrangement error where the student roots the $V$ but simply shifts the coefficients to the front or fails to understand that the coefficient must be part of the inverse operation.

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 Year 9 scripts:

below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=30% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=15% C=65% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=95% D=0%
