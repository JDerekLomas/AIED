In my experience marking this specific type of question, the core conflict is the order of operations in reverse (SAMDAB). 

**Tom's** method follows the standard "undoing" of the subtraction first ($+5$ to both sides), which is what most UK teachers drum into students. This is highly intuitive for most.

**Katie's** method (multiplying the whole equation by 3) is a valid algebraic step but is the "trapsite." Many students forget that when you multiply an equation by 3, you must multiply **every** term. Katie has multiplied $x/3$ and $12$, but neglected the $-5$. Students who struggle with distributive laws often think Katie is correct because "the 3s cancelled out and 12 times 3 is 36," failing to see that the $-5$ should become $-15$.

- **Below Basic** students often guess C because they see two confident-sounding statements or think any "mathsy" move is likely correct.
- **Basic/Low Foundation** students lean heavily toward B or C because they see "multiply by 3" as a shortcut to get rid of the fraction and don't check the middle term.
- **Proficient** students usually recognise Tom is right but are often tricked by Katie because the $12 \times 3 = 36$ looks "right" at a glance.
- **Advanced** students spot that Katie failed to multiply the constant term $-5$ by $3$.
