In this context, the classic pitfalls for a Year 9 student are the "double negative" for the final constant term and the sum of the two negative integers for the middle term.

**Breakdown of Errors:**
*   **Option B (Correct):** Students correctly identify $-5 + -7 = -12$ and $-5 \times -7 = +35$.
*   **Option D (The Sign Trap):** Extremely common. Students calculate $5 \times 7 = 35$ and "carry over" the negative sign from the brackets without applying the rule that a negative times a negative is a positive.
*   **Option A (The Difference Trap):** Students confuse adding the numbers with finding the difference between them ($7 - 5 = 2$), or simply lose track of the signs during the expansion process.
*   **Option C (The Ignoring-Signs Trap):** Students treat everything as positive, often seen in students who use a grid method but ignore the negative symbols outside the grid.
