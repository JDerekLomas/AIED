Having marked hundreds of these papers, here is the breakdown of how Year 9 students typically perform on this fractional addition question.

### Examiner's Notes:
*   **The Trap (Option B):** This is the "correct value" but "wrong format." Even higher-ability students often default to improper fractions because they are taught that mixed numbers are "dangerous" to calculate with, failing to read the "Leave your answer as a mixed number" instruction.
*   **The "Add Across" Error (Option D):** This is the classic misconception where students add the whole numbers correctly but add both the numerators and the denominators ($5+5=10$). It is incredibly common at lower ability levels.
*   **The Partial Logic (Option C):** This reflects a student who ignores the whole numbers entirely, converts everything to a single improper fraction incorrectly, or adds across and loses the whole numbers.
