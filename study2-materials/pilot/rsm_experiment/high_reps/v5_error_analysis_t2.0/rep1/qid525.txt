To predict these results, I have analysed the common pitfalls associated with Year 9 fractional addition:

*   **Option D (4 8/14)** is the classic "add the tops, add the bottoms" error. It is incredibly common among students who lack confidence with common denominators but know $2+2=4$.
*   **Option A (99/20)** is mathematically correct but ignores the rubric instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number." High-ability students often fall for this by moving too quickly.
*   **Option C (99/40)** results from multiplying the denominators together ($10 \times 4$) but failing to adjust the numerators correctly, or doubling the denominator unnecessarily.
*   **Option B (4 19/20)** is the correct answer ($\frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20}$).
