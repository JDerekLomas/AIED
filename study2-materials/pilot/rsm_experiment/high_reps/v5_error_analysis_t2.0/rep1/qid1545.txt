Having marked hundreds of these papers, this question tests the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) versus the tendency to read left-to-right. 

The left-hand side ($8 + 12 \div 4$) is the trap. Weak students calculate $20 \div 4 = 5$. Strong students do $8 + 3 = 11$. 
The right-hand side ($(8 + 12) \div 4$) forces the addition first because of the brackets, resulting in $20 \div 4 = 5$.

**The Trap:**
Students who don't know BIDMAS calculate both sides as 5 and choose **C**. 
Students who apply BIDMAS to the left but think the right-hand side is somehow different/larger often choose **B**.
Correct application leads to $11 > 5$, which is **A**.

**Ability Level Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often ignore order of operations entirely or get confused by the division. Many will guess C because both sides look like they contain the same numbers and operators.
*   **Basic:** The most common group to choose C. They tend to calculate $8+12$ first on both sides, missing the significance of the brackets (or lack thereof).
*   **Proficient:** They usually know BIDMAS but under exam pressure, a significant minority will still default to left-to-right reading or make a "silly" arithmetic slip.
*   **Advanced:** Almost always get this right; they spot the BIDMAS trap immediately and use the box to compare 11 and 5.
