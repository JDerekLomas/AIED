In this Year 9 mock, students find linear equations in the form $ax + by = c$ significantly more challenging than the standard $y = mx + c$. The substitution of $x=0$ should be straightforward, but many students "predict" the table rather than calculating, or fail to isolate $y$ correctly once the $x$ term is eliminated.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A (20):** A common "shot-in-the-dark" error for weaker students who see the numbers 4, 2, and 10 and perform a random operation (e.g., $(4+2) \times 10 / 3$ or simply thinking $2 \times 10$).
*   **B (3):** This is the most "attractive" trap. Many students look at the coefficients 4 and 2 and assume the sequence for $y$ must decrease or increase by a set amount related to the coefficients, or they solve $4(1) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow y = 3$ and assume the first box is related to the next step.
*   **C (5):** The correct answer. $4(0) + 2y = 10 \Rightarrow 2y = 10 \Rightarrow y = 5$.
*   **D (2.5):** A common division error where students mix up the numbers and do $10 / 4$ instead of $10 / 2$ because 4 is the first coefficient they see.
