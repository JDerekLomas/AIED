Having just sat at my desk marking 200 of these, this question is a classic "trap" that tests the intersection of statistical definitions and BIDMAS/order of operations.

**The "Attractive" Errors:**
*   **The Zero Trap (Option C):** This is the most common conceptual error. Students see a '0' and assume it doesn't count towards the total number of items, leading them to divide by 4.
*   **The Calculator Trap (Option B):** Students who think in terms of button presses often pick this. They forget that without brackets, a calculator (or the rules of BIDMAS) only divides the final number (7) by 5.
*   **The "Invisible Zero" (Option A):** This is the mathematically correct method ($\frac{15}{5} = 3$), but many students hesitate because the 0 isn't explicitly written in the numerator.

**Ability Level Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often pick B because it looks like how they type it into a cheap calculator, or D because they are confused by the missing '0' in the numerator of A.
*   **Basic:** The vast majority fall for C. They know the mean involves dividing, but they believe zeros are "nothing" and shouldn't be counted in the divisor.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually recognize that the 0 doesn't change the sum but does change the count. They select A, though a significant minority still get tempted by the "logic" of C.
*   **Advanced:** Almost all pick A. They check for the order of operations error in B and correctly identify that the count must be 5.

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=4% D=2%
