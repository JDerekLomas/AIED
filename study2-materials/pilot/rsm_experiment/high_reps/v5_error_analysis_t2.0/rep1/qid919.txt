In marking this question, I've observed that the difficulty lies entirely in the place value of squaring decimals. 

The "traps" break down as follows:
- **Option B (0.27):** The correct answer ($0.3^2 = 0.09$; $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$).
- **Option D (2.7):** The most "attractive" wrong answer. Students correctly square $3$ to get $9$, and then do $9 \times 3 = 27$, but misplace the decimal point by one place (treating $0.3^2$ as $0.9$).
- **Option A (0.81):** This occurs when a student multiplies $3$ and $0.3$ first to get $0.9$, and then squares the result ($0.9^2$). This is a classic BIDMAS/order of operations error.
- **Option C (1.8):** A common "below basic" error where students multiply the base by the index ($0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$) and then multiply by $3$ ($0.6 \times 3 = 1.8$).

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=30% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=15% B=60% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=0% D=3%
