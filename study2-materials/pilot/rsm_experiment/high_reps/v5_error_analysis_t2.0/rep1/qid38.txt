To solve $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator. Multiplying the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$ gives $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

**Teacher's Analysis of Distractors:**
*   **A (Correct):** Requires recognizing the denominator of the second fraction is a factor of the first.
*   **B (7/3x):** The "add across" error. Students add the numerators ($3+4$) and the denominators ($2x+x$). This is the most common misconception for lower-attaining students.
*   **C (11/x):** A partial process error where the student correctly identifies the need for "8" in the numerator but fails to maintain the correct common denominator ($2x$).
*   **D (7/2x):** The "numerator neglect" error. The student identifies $2x$ as the common denominator but forgets to multiply the numerator of the second fraction, simply adding $3+4$.
