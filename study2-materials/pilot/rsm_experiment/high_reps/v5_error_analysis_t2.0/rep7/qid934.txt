To determine the distribution of answers, I've looked at the specific traps this question sets for a Year 9 student:

*   **Option C (5)** is the "obvious" trap. Students often ignore the $4x$ entirely because $x=0$, or they look at $2y=10$ and perform $10 \div 2$. It feels "right" because it's a simple integer division.
*   **Option A (20)** is for students who see the 4 and 10 and assume multiplication ($2 \times 10$ or $4 \times 5$). 
*   **Option B (3)** is the correct answer $(2y = 10 \text{ when } x=0 \text{ means } y=5$; however, if the student correctly substitutes $x=0$, they get $2y=10 \rightarrow y=5$. If they make a slip with the coefficient or rearrange to $y = -2x + 5$, they should get 5. Wait—re-calculating: $4(0) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 10 \rightarrow y=5$.)
*   *Self-Correction on the key:* Looking at the equation $4x + 2y = 10$, when $x=0$, $y=5$. **C is actually the correct answer.** **D (2.5)** is the most common high-ability error ($10 \div 4$), assuming the $x$ and $y$ coefficients are swapped or simply dividing the total by the larger coefficient.
