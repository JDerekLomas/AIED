Having just marked 200 of these, I can tell you that $10 = \frac{5}{p}$ is a notorious "trap" question for Year 9s.

The most common error by far is "operation reversal." Students see 10 and 5 and intuitively think "10 divided by 5 is 2," leading them to $p=2$. Even mid-ability students often multiply both sides by 5 instead of $p$, or simply ignore the structure of the fraction because they are used to the variable being on top. Option B ($p=50$) is the choice of the student who knows they need to multiply but chooses the wrong numbers to combine. $p=0.5$ is the "safe" choice for those who actually perform the algebraic steps correctly ($\text{multiply by } p \text{ to get } 10p=5$, then $\text{divide by } 10$).

Here is the predicted breakdown based on the mock scripts I've seen today:

below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=60% D=5%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=38% D=2%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=5% D=0%
