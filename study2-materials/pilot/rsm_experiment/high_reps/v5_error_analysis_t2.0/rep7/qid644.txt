In this Year 9 mock, students frequently trip up on the distinction between adding and multiplying directed numbers. The "attractive" wrong answer here is D, as students often default to "negative and negative equals a bigger negative" (confusing addition and multiplication rules) or simply perform $-1 - 4$. 

**Breakdown of errors:**
*   **A (Correct):** Students recognize that "multiplying" means $(-1) \times (-4) = +4$.
*   **B (Sign Error):** Students know to multiply, but forget that two negatives make a positive.
*   **C (Addition Sign Error):** Students add the numbers instead of multiplying, but think the negatives "cancel out" to a positive $(1 + 4 = 5)$.
*   **D (Addition Error):** Students perform $(-1) + (-4)$ or simply $1 + 4$ then keep the negative sign. This is the most common error for lower-ability students.
