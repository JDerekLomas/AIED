In this question, the common pitfall is the transition from Step 1 to Step 2. Students correctly identify that $15 \times 4 = 60$, but many struggle with the inverse operation required to move the $+1$. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to get 59, they see the $1+k$ and instinctively add 1 to the 60. This "misapplied inverse" is a classic Year 9 error.

**Analysis of Errors:**
- **Step 1 is correct:** $(15 \times 4 = 60)$.
- **Step 2 is incorrect:** To solve $60 = 1 + k$, you must subtract 1 $(k = 59)$. The error in the question ($61 = k$) comes from adding 1 to 60.
- **A (Only step 1)** is the correct answer.
- **C (Both correct)** is the strongest distractor for students who don't check the inverse operation in the second step.
- **B (Only step 2)** is rare, usually representing a student who guessed or made a mental error on the first multiplication but thought the "add 1" looked right.
