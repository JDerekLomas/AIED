To solve this, we must identify that we need the multiplicative inverse of $-\frac{3}{4}$ to result in $1$, but the product is $-1$. 

**Thinking behind the percentages:**
*   **A ($\frac{4}{3}$):** This is the "trap" answer. Students correctly identify that the fraction needs to be flipped (reciprocal), but they either lose the negative sign in the process or correctly apply the logic that "positive $\times$ negative = negative" and choose the positive version. This feels "mathematically complete" to a Year 9 student.
*   **B ($-\frac{4}{3}$):** This is the correct answer. The negative $\times$ negative rule often tricks students into thinking the answer should be positive, so many middle-attainers avoid this.
*   **C ($\frac{3}{4}$):** Students here see the $-1$ and think "nothing much has changed, so the number stays the same, just change the sign." It is a common additive-thinking error.
*   **D ($-\frac{3}{4}$):** This is a low-level error where students believe multiplying a number by itself somehow results in 1 (confusing it with square roots or simply "cancelling out" because they look the same).
