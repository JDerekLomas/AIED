To solve $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator (likely $2x$). This requires doubling the numerator of the second fraction: $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A (Correct):** Students correctly scale the second fraction.
*   **B (Add everything):** The most common lower-ability error. Students add the numerators ($3+4$) and the denominators ($2x+x$). This "feels" right to those who forget that fractions require common denominators.
*   **C (Scaling Error):** Students recognize the common denominator is $x$ (incorrectly) or find 11 but forget to keep the $2$ in the denominator, perhaps thinking the $2$ only applied to the first term's numerator.
*   **D (Partial Execution):** Students find the common denominator of $2x$ but forget to multiply the numerator of the second fraction by 2 ($3+4=7$).
