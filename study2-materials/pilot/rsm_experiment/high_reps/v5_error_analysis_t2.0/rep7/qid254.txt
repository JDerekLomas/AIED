Having marked hundreds of these, this is a classic "conceptual vs. procedural" trap question. 

The inclusion of **0** is the primary distractor. Students often equate "0" with "nothing," leading them to either omit it from the sum or, more commonly, omit it from the count of numbers (the divisor). 

**The logic behind the errors:**
*   **A (The Correct Answer):** Some students will worry that the '0' isn't written in the numerator, but mathematically $0+1+3+4+7$ is the same as $1+3+4+7$. Those who understand that 0 is still a "data point" that must be counted in the divisor ($n=5$) will pick this.
*   **B (The BODMAS/Calculator Trap):** This is the "natural" way a student types it into a basic scientific calculator without pressing equals or using brackets. It technically only divides the 7 by 5. Lower-ability students often don't spot the hierarchy of operations error in written form.
*   **C (The "Zero Doesn't Count" Error):** The most common mistake. Students sum the non-zero digits and divide by 4 because they think 0 "doesn't count."
*   **D (The Perfectionist Trap):** Advanced students who are *too* pedantic might choose this because 0 isn't explicitly shown in the numerator of Option A, even though the calculation remains correct.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=10% B=50% C=35% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=30% D=10%
advanced: A=85% B=0% C=5% D=10%
