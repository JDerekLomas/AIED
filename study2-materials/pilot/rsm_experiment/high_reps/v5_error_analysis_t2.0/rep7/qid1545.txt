To predict these percentages, I have looked at the common misconceptions surrounding the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). 

The calculation on the left side is **$8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$**.
The calculation on the right side is **$(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$**.
The correct answer is **A ($11 > 5$)**.

**Common Pitfalls:**
*   **The Left-to-Right Trap:** Students who ignore BIDMAS calculate the left side as $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$. This leads them to see $5 \square 5$ and choose **C ($=$)**.
*   **Symbol Confusion:** Students who calculate correctly but confuse the direction of the inequality signs ($<$ vs $>$) often choose **B**.
*   **Over-complication:** Lower-ability students often guess **D** simply because it looks "more mathematical" or they don't understand the horizontal line under the symbol.
