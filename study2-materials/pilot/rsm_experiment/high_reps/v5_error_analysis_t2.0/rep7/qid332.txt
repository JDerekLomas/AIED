To predict these results, I’ve looked at the specific misconceptions surrounding multi-step equations and the distributive property of division.

**Tom's logic** (+5 to both sides) is the standard first step taught in UK classrooms. Most students find this intuitive.
**Katie's logic** (multiplying by 3) is a common "shortcut" error. Students often forget that if they multiply the left side by 3, they must multiply *every* term, including the -5. Many students will see $3 \times 12 = 36$ and think she is correct because the numbers "work out" nicely.

*   **Below Basic:** Students often struggle with the order of operations in reverse. They might guess C because they assume "both" is a safe answer in a "Who is correct?" question.
*   **Basic:** These students understand Tom's +5, but they fall for Katie’s trap. They don't yet grasp that the 5 isn't part of the fraction, making Katie's line $(x-15=36)$ the actual correct version of that step.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually recognize Tom is right. Some will still be lured by Katie’s 36, but many will notice that the -5 remained unchanged.
*   **Advanced:** These students see the "balance" error immediately. They know that to multiply by 3, the entire side must be multiplied.

basic: A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=22% D=3%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=4% D=1%
