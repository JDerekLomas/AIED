To predict the outcome for these Year 9 students, we first look at the mathematical traps:

*   **Option A (6):** The correct answer. Requires BIDMAS/Order of Operations. $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 = -2$, and $-2 + 8 = 6$.
*   **Option B (4):** A very common "left-to-right" error with a sign mistake. $3 - 5 = -2$. $-2 + 4 = 2$. $2 \times 2 = 4$. This is attractive to students who ignore BIDMAS entirely and calculate linearly.
*   **Option C (-12):** Another linear error but involving a subtraction mistake: $3 - 5 = -2$. $-2 + 4 = 2$, but then incorrectly thinking $2 \times -??$ or some variation of signs, or more commonly: $3 - (5+4) \times 2 \rightarrow 3 - 9 \times 2 = -15$ (near miss). Actually, C is often chosen by those who do $3-5 = -2$, then $4 \times 2 = 8$, but they subtract the 8 from -2 to get -10, or miscalculate the $-2 + 8$ as $-10$.
*   **Option D (-10):** A specific BIDMAS trap. $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - (5 + 8) = -10$. Students mistakenly "group" the addition after the multiplication before dealing with the 3. Or, $3 - 5 = -2$, $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $-2 - 8 = -10$.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **Below Basic** students often work strictly left-to-right, leading them to 4. 
*   **Basic** students remember BIDMAS but struggle with directed numbers (negatives). They get the 8, but fail at $3 - 5 + 8$.
*   **Proficient** students usually get to the addition/subtraction stage but some get tripped up by the "A" before "S" in BIDMAS, thinking they must add 5 and 8 before subtracting from 3.
*   **Advanced** students see the term-by-term nature of the expression.
