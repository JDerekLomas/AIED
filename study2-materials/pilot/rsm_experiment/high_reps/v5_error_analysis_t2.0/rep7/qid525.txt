To arrive at these predictions, I have considered the following common Year 9 behaviours:

*   **The Trap (Option D):** This is the classic "add the numerators, add the denominators" error. It feels natural to students who lack a conceptual grasp of equivalent fractions.
*   **The Format Penalty (Option A):** This is the correct numerical value but as an improper fraction. Many "Basic/Proficient" students forget to re-read the final line of the question: "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
*   **Common Denominator Error (Option C):** This represents students who know they need a common denominator but simply multiply the denominators (getting 40) and either forget to adjust the numerators or add them incorrectly, often leaving the answer as an improper fraction.
*   **The Success (Option B):** This requires finding the lowest common multiple (20), converting correctly, adding, and keeping the format as a mixed number.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on 200 mock papers:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=25% D=50%
basic: A=20% B=35% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=25% B=60% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=2% D=0%
