To predict the performance of a Year 9 cohort on this question, we must look at the algebraic manipulation of the sphere volume formula: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

*   **Error for A:** Students often struggle with "fraction flipping." They see the $3$ on the bottom and the $4$ on top and simply multiply both across, failing to realize that to isolate $r$, they must multiply by the reciprocal ($3/4$). 
*   **Error for B:** A very common mistake where the student remembers to "divide by the bit next to the $r$", but treats $4/3$ as a single unit and incorrectly positions the $3$ in the denominator during the move.
*   **Error for D:** This is an "visual memory" error. The student remembers there is a cube root and the numbers 3 and 4, but fails to use inverse operations, simply moving the constants outside the radical or forgetting to include them in the root.
*   **C (Correct):** Requires multiplying by 3, dividing by $4\pi$, and then taking the cube root.

**Year 9 Performance Prediction:**

**below_basic:** (Predicting mostly guesses or choosing options that "look" like the formula they marginally recognize)
below_basic: A=30% B=35% C=10% D=25%

**basic:** (These students know the formula but fall into the "reciprocal trap". They see a 4 and a 3 and often pick A or B because the 4 remains on top in their mental model.)
basic: A=35% B=30% C=20% D=15%

**proficient:** (These students usually perform the steps $3V$ and then $3V/4\pi$. The main error here is B, through a clerical error in rearranging the fraction.)
proficient: A=15% B=20% C=60% D=5%

**advanced:** (High-level Year 9 students handle literal equations and inverse operations confidently.)
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=88% D=2%
