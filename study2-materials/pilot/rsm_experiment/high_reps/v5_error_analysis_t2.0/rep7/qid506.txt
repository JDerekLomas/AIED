Having just spent the weekend marking 200 of these Year 9 scripts, I’ve seen exactly how students trip up here. The equation looks deceptively simple, but the fraction on the right-hand side acts as a massive "distractor" for those with shaky algebraic manipulation.

The most common trap is **Option A**, where students see the 3 and the 12 and immediately think "3 fits into 12 four times," mistakenly multiplying the left by 3 or dividing 12 by 3. **Option C** is the classic "I don't like fractions" move, where students essentially invert the 12 and then divide by 3 (or multiply by mistake). **Option D** is a rarer error where students might misread the 12 or try to subtract. **Option B** is the only correct path—multiplying both sides by 1/3 (or dividing by 3)—which many mid-range students find counter-intuitive.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on my mark book:

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=65% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
