In this context, I am looking at common pitfalls regarding negative numbers. For Year 9 students, the arithmetic of $(-5) \times (-7)$ and $(-5) + (-7)$ is the primary differentiator between ability levels, rather than the process of FOIL/expanding itself.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option B (Correct):** Recognises both that $-5 - 7 = -12$ and that two negatives multiply to make a positive $+35$.
*   **Option D (Most Attractive Distractor):** The "Common Sense" trap. Students correctly sum to $-12$ but intuitively think "a negative times a negative must stay negative" or simply forget to switch the sign for the final term. This is very common in mid-range sets.
*   **Option A:** A classic subtraction error. Students see 5 and 7 and find the difference (2) instead of the sum.
*   **Option C:** A total sign failure, often seen in students who use a grid but ignore the negative signs entirely.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
