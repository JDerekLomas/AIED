To predict these results, I have considered the following common Year 9 misconceptions:
*   **The Dividend/Divisor Swap (D):** Students often associate the "larger" or "more complex" term with being the numerator, leading them to put the binomial expression on top.
*   **The "Division as Fraction Bar" omission (C):** Students who treat algebra as a linear left-to-right process often forget that the brackets dictate the scope of the fraction bar, mistakenly thinking the $+4$ is separate.
*   **The Variable Hallucination (B):** A classic "weak student" error where they attempt to balance the fraction by adding the $+4$ to the numerator just because it exists in the denominator.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on a typical 200-paper cohort:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=55% B=5% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=0% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
