Having just spent several hours marking Year 9 mock papers, I have seen exactly where students trip up on BIDMAS/order of operations.

The calculation on the left side, $8 + 12 \div 4$, is the classic trap. A student must correctly divide before adding ($8 + 3 = 11$). However, the most "attractive" error is simply reading left-to-right, performing $20 \div 4 = 5$. 

On the right side, $(8 + 12) \div 4$ forces the addition first because of the brackets ($20 \div 4 = 5$). 

**The Patterns observed:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many assume the expressions must be equal because they contain the same numbers and symbols ($11 = 11$ or $5 = 5$ by coincidence), or they calculate $5 = 5$ and pick **C**. Others guess randomly.
*   **Basic:** Most calculate the right side as 5 correctly. On the left side, they almost instinctively go left-to-right to get 5. This makes **C** an incredibly popular "trap" answer for this cohort.
*   **Proficient:** These students remember BIDMAS but often rush. Most will get $11 > 5$ (**A**), but a significant minority will perform the right-hand side correctly and then suffer a "brain fade," applying the left-to-right rule to the left side and selecting **C**.
*   **Advanced:** These students see the trap immediately. They will rarely pick anything other than **A**.

Here are my predicted percentages based on those 200 papers:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
