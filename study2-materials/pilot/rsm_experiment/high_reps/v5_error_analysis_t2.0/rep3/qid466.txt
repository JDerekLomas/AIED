To reach the product of $-1$, the missing value must be the **reciprocal** of $-\frac{3}{4}$.

*   **Option A ($\frac{4}{3}$):** This is the most "attractive" trap. Students correctly identify that the fraction needs to be flipped (the reciprocal), but they fail to account for the sign, thinking that "changing the sign" is part of the reciprocal process (confusing it with the negative reciprocal used in perpendicular gradients).
*   **Option B ($-\frac{4}{3}$):** The correct answer. Requires the student to know that a negative $\times$ negative = positive, but since the result is negative, and one factor is already negative, the missing factor must be positive? No, wait—if the target is $-1$, and we start with $-\frac{3}{4}$, we need a **positive** $\frac{4}{3}$. 
    *Wait, let me re-evaluate as a teacher:* $-\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Something} = -1$.
    Since the result is negative, and we already have one negative, the star must be **positive**.
    The reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$ is $\frac{4}{3}$.
    **The correct answer is A.** 

*Let's re-align the distractors based on the target $A$:*
*   **Option B ($-\frac{4}{3}$):** This is the most common error for high-ability students who overthink the signs (knowing they need a reciprocal but reflexively adding a minus sign because they see negatives in the question).
*   **Option C ($\frac{3}{4}$):** Chosen by students who think multiplication by $1$ (or $-1$) keeps the digits the same, ignoring the fraction logic.
*   **Option D ($-\frac{3}{4}$):** Common for students who think that to get $-1$ you simply multiply the number by itself (confusing it with squaring or additive inverses).
