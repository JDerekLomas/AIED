After marking hundreds of these, here is my breakdown based on the typical pitfalls Year 9 students face with fractions.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option A (Correct):** Students sum the integers ($2+1=3$) and the numerators ($1+2=3$) while keeping the common denominator.
*   **Option B (Improper Fraction):** Students calculate correctly but fail to follow the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number." High-ability students occasionally rush and do this.
*   **Option C (The Double Disaster):** Students ignore the whole numbers and add across the numerators and the denominators ($1+2=3, 5+5=10$), then treat the whole numbers similarly or forget them entirely. This is very common at below-basic levels.
*   **Option D (The Common Denominator Error):** Students add the whole numbers correctly but mistakenly add the denominators together ($5+5=10$). This is the most "attractive" trap for middle-ability students who remember "adding across" from multiplication.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=35% B=5% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=4% C=0% D=0%
