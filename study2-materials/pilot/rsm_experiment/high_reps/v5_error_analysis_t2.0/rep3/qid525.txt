To predict these results, I have analysed the common pitfalls for Year 9 students:

*   **Option D (The "Adder" Trap):** This is the classic lower-ability error. Students simply add the numerators ($7+1$) and the denominators ($10+4$). It feels "natural" and logical to those who haven't mastered the concept of a common denominator.
*   **Option C (Partial Calculation):** This often stems from an attempt to find a common denominator but failing. A student might multiply the denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) and potentially convert to improper fractions incorrectly or leave the result as an improper fraction, failing the "leave as a mixed number" instruction.
*   **Option A (The "Format" Fail):** This is the correct numerical value ($\frac{99}{20}$), but it ignores the instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number. This is where many "Proficient" students lose a mark due to rushing.
*   **Option B (Correct):** Finding the common denominator (20), adjusting the numerators ($14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20$), and adding the whole numbers.

The "Below Basic" group will almost universally gravitate toward the simplest looking arithmetic (Option D), while the "Advanced" group will only miss the mark if they misread the final formatting instruction.

below_basic: A=5% B=15% C=20% D=60%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
