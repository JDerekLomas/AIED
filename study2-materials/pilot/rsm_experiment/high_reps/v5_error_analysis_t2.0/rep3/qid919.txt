To predict the performance for this specific non-calculator Year 9 question, we must look at the specific misconceptions:
*   **A (0.81):** This occurs when a student squares $(3x)$ instead of $3(x^2)$. They do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then $0.9^2$.
*   **B (0.27):** This is the **correct answer**. $0.3^2 = 0.09$, and $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$.
*   **C (1.8):** This is the "Double it" error. Students confuse squaring with multiplying by 2. They do $0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$, then $0.6 \times 3 = 1.8$.
*   **D (2.7):** The "Decimal Slip". Students do $3^2 \times 3$ or simply misplace the decimal point while squaring $0.3$ (thinking $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$). This is the most "attractive" wrong answer for mid-range students.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=65% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
