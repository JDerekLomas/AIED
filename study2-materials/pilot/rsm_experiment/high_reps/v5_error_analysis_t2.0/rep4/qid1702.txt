To predict these results, I’ve analysed the common pitfalls for Year 9 students tackling linear equations and substitution.

**Thinking Process:**
*   **The Trap (Answer C):** The most common error is a "reversal" error. Students see $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, correctly get $10x - 3 = 30$, but then subtract 3 instead of adding it, leading to $10x = 27$ and $x = 2.7$ (Option D). Alternatively, many students try to "logic" their way through by guessing or doing $30 + 3$ then accidentally dividing by a wrong number, but Option C ($3.3$) is highly attractive to lower-ability students who simply do $(30 + 3) / 10 = 3.3$. 
*   **Option D (2.7):** This is the classic "sign error" result. Students do $10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 27 \rightarrow x = 2.7$. This is very common for mid-range (Basic/Proficient) students who know the steps but fail the inverse operation.
*   **Option B (-4.25):** This attracts students who mix up the $x$ and $y$ values, substituting $x=0.5$ into the equation and solving for $y$. $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30 \rightarrow -6y = 25 \rightarrow y \approx -4.16$ (students often round or miscalculate this to $4.25$).
*   **The Correct Answer (A):** $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 33 \rightarrow x = 3.3$. (Note: In many exam papers, if C is $3.3$ and A is $4.25$ or similar, the distractor $3.3$ is the intended correct path). 
*   *Correction for this specific set of options:* Working through $10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$. Therefore, **C is the correct answer**. A and B are "distractors" based on $x$ and $y$ confusion.
