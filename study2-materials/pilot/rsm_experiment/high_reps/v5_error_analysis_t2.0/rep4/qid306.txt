To a Year 9 student, "Order of Operations" often means "memorised acronym" rather than "underlying structure." Having marked these for years, I see two distinct traps here: the "Reading Order" trap and the "Addition before Subtraction" trap.

**The Logic of the Errors:**
*   **A is the "Pure Left-to-Right" trap:** This is the most common error for Below Basic students who simply read math like English and haven't internalized BIDMAS.
*   **B is the "Mathematically Correct" choice:** It acknowledges that $+$ and $-$ have equal priority (so we go left-to-right) and that $\times$ outranks $+$.
*   **C is the "Confusion" trap:** This student has been told BIDMAS applies everywhere, but they aren't sure how. They often end up just guessing based on the last thing they heard.
*   **D is the "Over-application of BIDMAS" trap:** This is a classic "Basic" or "Lower-Proficient" mistake. Because the 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in BIDMAS/BODMAS, students falsely believe they *must* do $5+6$ before the $4-$. They think they are being clever by applying the rule literally.

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 mock papers:

below_basic: A=65% B=15% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=5% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=65% C=0% D=25%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=0% D=3%
