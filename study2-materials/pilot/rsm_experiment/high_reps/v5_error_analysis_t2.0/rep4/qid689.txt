In this common Year 9 question, the main obstacle is "algebraic intuition" regarding the position of the unknown. Students frequently struggle when the variable is the denominator. 

**Diagnostic breakdown:**
*   **A ($p=0.5$):** This is the correct answer ($10p = 5 \implies p = 5/10$).
*   **B ($p=50$):** A common "multiplication reflex" error where students see 10 and 5 and assume they must multiply them to clear the fraction, ignoring the actual position of $p$.
*   **C ($p=2$):** The most common "commutative trap." Students see the numbers 10 and 5 and simply divide the larger by the smaller ($10 \div 5$), a mistake very common for those who lack a formal balancing method.
*   **D (No solutions):** Chosen by students who think a larger number cannot be the result of dividing a smaller number by something (ignoring decimals).
