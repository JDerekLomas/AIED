To predict these results, I am drawing on the classic Year 9 pitfall: **Inverse Operations.**

In **Step 1**, Isaac correctly multiplies by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). Most students recognize this "start." 
In **Step 2**, Isaac makes the most common error in KS3 algebra: he sees $+1$ and instinctively adds 1 to 60 to get 61, rather than subtracting it to reach the correct answer of 59.

**Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often guess randomly or pick 'C' because they see "numbers moving" and assume it's right.
*   **Basic:** They recognize the first step is correct (multiplying by 4), but they fall for the "plus/minus" trap in Step 2, leading them to choose 'C'.
*   **Proficient:** These students identify that 60 is correct, but they have the algebraic fluency to spot that $60 - 1 = 59$. They correctly identify only Step 1 is right.
*   **Advanced:** Almost 100% success rate; they often re-solve the equation themselves before looking at the options.
