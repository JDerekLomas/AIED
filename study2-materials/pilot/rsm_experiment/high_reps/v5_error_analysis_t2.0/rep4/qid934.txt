In this Year 9 mock, students find linear equations in the form $ax + by = c$ significantly more challenging than the standard $y = mx + c$. The primary hurdle is the multi-step process: substituting $x=0$ correctly and then rearranging the remaining equation.

*   **A (20):** A common "shot in the dark" for those who multiply $4 \times 5$ or confuse $x$ and $y$ operations.
*   **B (3):** This is the most common conceptual error; students assume the gradient of -2 (derived from -4/2) or incorrectly guess the next value in a pattern without starting at the intercept.
*   **C (5):** The "trap" answer. Students substitute $x=0$, leaving $2y = 10$, and correctly divide 10 by 2. This is the intended path for those who understand basic substitution.
*   **D (2.5):** A "distractor" for those who accidentally swap the roles of $x$ and $y$ or try to divide 10 by 4 instead of 2.

Here is the predicted distribution based on the 200 papers marked:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=25% C=55% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=97% D=1%
