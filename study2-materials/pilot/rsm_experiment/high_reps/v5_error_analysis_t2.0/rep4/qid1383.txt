In this Year 9 mock, this question specifically tests the understanding of powers and the treatment of negative bases. 

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **B and D (12 and -12):** These are the most common "below basic" errors where students multiply the base by the index ($3 \times 4$). 
*   **C (-81):** This is the most common "trap" for mid-to-high ability students. It occurs when students calculate $3^4 = 81$ but incorrectly believe that a negative base raised to any power must stay negative, or more commonly, they type `-3^4` into a non-scientific calculator (or even some scientific ones without using brackets), leading to the calculator processing it as $-(3^4)$.
*   **A (81):** This requires the student to know that an even exponent results in a positive value when the base is negative (i.e., $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$).

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=0% C=8% D=0%
