In this context, I am evaluating the expansion of a quadratic where the primary difficulty is managing two negative signs (directed numbers).

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option B (Correct):** Students correctly calculate $-5 - 7 = -12$ and $-5 \times -7 = +35$.
*   **Option D (The "Product" Trap):** This is the most common error. Students correctly find the $-12m$ but apply "negative times a negative equals a negative" (confusing it with addition rules) or simply forget that both numbers are negative when multiplying.
*   **Option A (The "Difference" Trap):** These students subtract 5 from 7 to get 2 (often writing $-2m$) and then apply the $-35$ product rule incorrectly.
*   **Option C (The "Ignore Signs" Trap):** Students ignore the signs in front of the 5 and 7, treat them as positives for the addition ($12m$), and often remember the rule that two negatives make a positive for the end ($+35$).

**Predicted Distribution:**

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=10% B=35% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=94% C=1% D=3%
