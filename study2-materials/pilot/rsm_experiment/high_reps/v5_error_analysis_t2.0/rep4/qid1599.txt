To predict these percentages, I have considered the following common Year 9 misconceptions:
*   **The "Order" Trap (D):** Weaker students often focus on the visual length of terms rather than the operator, or mistakenly believe the larger "clump" belongs on top.
*   **The "BIDMAS" Visual Trap (C):** Students who think the division only applies to the term immediately following it, failing to see the brackets as a "package."
*   **The "Cloning" Error (B):** A classic novice mistake where students try to balance the fraction by repeating a term from the denominator on the top.

Here is the predicted distribution based on typical mock exam performance:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=3% C=7% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
