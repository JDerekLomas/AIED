In this Year 9 mock, students frequently trip up on the distinction between adding and multiplying when dealing with directed numbers. 

The two "traps" are:
1.  **Additive Thinking (C & D):** Many lower-ability students see $-1$ and $-4$ and intuitively combine them to get $-5$ or $+5$ instead of multiplying.
2.  **The Sign Error (B):** This is the most common error for mid-range students; they know $1 \times 4 = 4$, but they forget that "a minus times a minus makes a plus."

**Breakdown of errors:**
*   **Below Basic:** High prevalence of "adding" the numbers (D is very attractive because $-1-4$ feels like it should be $-5$).
*   **Basic:** They know to multiply, but almost half will forget the sign rule and choose -4.
*   **Proficient:** Generally confident with the multiplication, though a small percentage will make a "silly" sign error under exam pressure.
*   **Advanced:** Should find this trivial; those who drop a mark here usually do so through extreme haste.
