This question is a standard quadratic expansion that tests three specific skills: the FOIL method/grid method, directed number addition $(-5 + -7)$, and directed number multiplication $(-5 \times -7)$.

The primary "trap" here is the signs. Students often correctly identify the middle term as $-12m$ but frequently stumble on the final term, either believing that "two minuses make a minus" in addition/multiplication interchangeably, or simply forgetting to multiply the signs at all. Option A is a common distractor for students who perform $-7 + 5$ or $7 - 5$ incorrectly. Option C is chosen by those who ignore the negative signs entirely. Option D is the most common error among "Basic" and "Proficient" students who correctly sum to $-12$ but forget that $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$.

Below is the predicted performance across UK ability levels (e.g., Foundation vs Higher tier entry):

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
