This question addresses a very common point of confusion in the UK curriculum regarding the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). 

For **Problem P**, many students incorrectly believe that because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym, they must add before they subtract ($5+6$), whereas the rule is to work from left to right. This is a "strong" misconception that persists even into the proficient level.
For **Problem Q**, the hierarchy is clearer; most students know multiplication precedes addition, though lower-ability students still tend to work strictly from left to right.

The "trap" here is **Option D**, which combines the correct application of BIDMAS for multiplication with the most common misconception for addition/subtraction.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=25% C=15% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=45% C=5% D=45%
advanced: A=2% B=88% C=0% D=10%
