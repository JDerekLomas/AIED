This question is a classic test of two distinct mathematical concepts: the role of the number zero in a data set and the correct use of order of operations (BIDMAS) when writing expressions.

**Option A** is the correct answer. Adding $0$ doesn't change the numerator, but the divisor must still be $5$ because there are five values in the data set.
**Option B** is a common trap involving BIDMAS. Without brackets around the addition, this calculation would result in $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + (7 \div 5)$, which is mathematically incorrect for finding the mean.
**Option C** is the "ignore the zero" misconception, where students believe that since zero has no value, it doesn't count as a "piece of data."

**Teacher's Analysis:**
Lower-ability students often struggle with the "invisibility" of zero and will gravitate toward Option C. Mid-ability students (basic/proficient) are often aware that zero counts toward the total count, making Option A very attractive. The real differentiator is Option B; many proficient students understand the process of the mean but are "notation blind" and fail to see that Option B lacks the necessary brackets for the division to apply to the whole sum. Advanced students will spot the BIDMAS error in B immediately and confirm that A is the only mathematically sound expression.
