This question tests a very specific component of the FOIL (First, Outside, Inside, Last) method: the "Last" terms. It specifically targets the student's ability to handle the multiplication of two negative constants.

While most students identify that they need to "do something" with the numbers 1 and 4, the primary error is sign-related. Lower-ability students often confuse the rules for multiplying negatives with the rules for adding/subtracting them (leading to -5) or simply ignore one of the signs (leading to -4). Option C (+5) is a common "operation confusion" error where students add instead of multiply, but it is less common than sign errors in this context.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **A (+4):** Correct. $(-1) \times (-4) = +4$.
*   **B (-4):** The most common mistake for "basic" students who know they must multiply but think "a negative and a negative makes a negative" or only apply the sign to one digit.
*   **C (+5):** Rare error; involves adding the absolute values and ignoring the multiplication instruction.
*   **D (-5):** Very common for lower-ability students who essentially perform $(-1) - 4$ or "combine" the terms as if adding.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=55% B=30% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=88% B=8% C=2% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
