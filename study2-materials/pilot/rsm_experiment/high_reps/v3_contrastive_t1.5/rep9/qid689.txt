This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. While it looks simple, it is notoriously difficult for students below the 'proficient' level.

The most common error is the "division order" misconception. Students see the numbers 10 and 5 and instinctively calculate $10 \div 5 = 2$. Even though they know $10 = 5/p$ requires finding what 5 is divided by to get 10, the cognitive load of the fraction leads them to perform the most obvious division.

Option B ($p=50$) attracts those who think they need to multiply the two visible numbers. Option D is a distractor for students who believe a smaller number cannot be divided to result in a larger number.

The "advanced" group will quickly recognise this as $p = 5/10$ and convert to $0.5$. The "proficient" group will likely perform the algebraic steps ($10p = 5$) and arrive at the correct result, though some will still fall for the "10 divided by 5" trap.
