As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question on adding mixed numbers.

The question contains several key features:
1. **The Trap (Option D):** This is the classic "add the numerators and add the denominators" error ($2+2=4, 7+1=8, 10+4=14$). This is the most common misconception for students at below-basic and basic levels.
2. **The Format Trap (Option A):** This is the correct numerical value but expressed as an improper fraction ($\frac{99}{20}$). The question explicitly asks for a **mixed number**. Students who convert to improper fractions to add (a common reliable method) often forget to convert back at the end.
3. **Common Denominator Error (Option C):** This represents a student multiplying the denominators to get 40 but failing to adjust the numerators correctly, or simply picking a "fraction-looking" number that looks roughly right.
4. **Proficiency:** Advanced and Proficient students will likely find the common denominator of 20 and handle the transition to $4 \frac{19}{20}$ easily, though a small percentage of Proficient students will lose the mark on A by failing to read the "mixed number" instruction.

Predicted student performance:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=25% D=50%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
