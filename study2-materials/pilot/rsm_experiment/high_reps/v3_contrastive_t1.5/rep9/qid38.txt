As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this algebraic fractions question by looking at the specific common pitfalls. 

The most common error in adding fractions is adding the numerators and adding the denominators ($3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$), which leads to Option B. However, even students who know they need a common denominator often make a "half-step" error: they find the common denominator ($2x$), but forget to multiply the second numerator by 2 ($3+4=7$ over $2x$), leading to Option D. Option A is the correct answer ($\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$).

This specific question is tricky because the denominators are $2x$ and $x$, meaning only one fraction needs to be changed. This often leads to more careless errors than if both denominators needed changing (e.g., $x$ and $y$).

**Breakdown of choices:**
*   **A (Correct):** Students recognize $2x$ is the LCM and double the 4.
*   **B (Add everything):** The classic "I don't understand fractions" error.
*   **C (Incorrect denominator):** Changing the denominator to $x$ without dividing the 3 by 2 (less common but happens).
*   **D (Partial process):** Finding the common denominator but failing to scale the numerator.
