As an experienced teacher, I've analyzed this question. It tests the ability to substitute a value into a linear equation that is not in the form $y=mx+c$.

The "trap" here is that the $x$ and $y$ are on the same side. Students at lower ability levels often ignore the coefficient of $y$ or perform the wrong inverse operation. 
*   **Option C (5)** is the most common correct answer ($2y=10$, so $y=5$). 
*   **Option B (3)** is a common mistake where students substitute $x=1$ or $x=2$ accidentally, or subtract $4$ from $7$ (if they mix up the equation). 
*   **Option D (2.5)** comes from students dividing 10 by 4, treating it as $4y=10$. 
*   **Option A (20)** is a "blind" calculation error, likely $10 \times 2$.

The substitution $x=0$ actually makes this question easier than if $x$ were a non-zero integer, as it eliminates the $4x$ term entirely. This prevents many basic-level students from making calculation errors with $x$.

Here is the predicted performance breakdown:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=50% D=25%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=75% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=88% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=98% D=1%
