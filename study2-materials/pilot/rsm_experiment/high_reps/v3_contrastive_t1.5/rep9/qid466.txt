This question specifically tests two key concepts in Year 8/9 algebra and arithmetic: the property of the **multiplicative inverse (reciprocals)** and the **rules of directed numbers (multiplying negatives)**.

The primary "trap" here is the sign. Many students remember that a reciprocal is needed to result in 1, but they struggle with whether the negative sign should be kept or removed to result in negative 1. 

*   **Below Basic** students often look for symmetry or "cancelling out" without understanding the operation. Many will choose C or D because they simply see the numbers already present.
*   **Basic** students often remember that a fraction multiplied by its flip (reciprocal) is 1. However, they frequently make the "sign change" error, thinking that to keep a result negative, one of the factors must be positive. This makes Option A the most common distractor for this level.
*   **Proficient** students recognize the identity $n \times \frac{1}{n} = 1$. They calculate $(-\frac{3}{4}) \times (\frac{4}{3}) = -1$. Because the target is $-1$, they correctly identify that only one negative sign is needed in the product.
*   **Advanced** students solve this almost instantly. The only risk is a "silly mistake" or overthinking it into a double negative, but this is rare.

The wording of the question is clean, which helps, but the presence of both $4/3$ and $-4/3$ tests the negative number rules precisely.
