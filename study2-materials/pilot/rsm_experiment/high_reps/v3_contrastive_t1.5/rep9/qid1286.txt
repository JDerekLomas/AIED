This question tests the ability to rearrange the formula for the volume of a sphere: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

While the conceptual step is straightforward (rearranging to make $r$ the subject), students often struggle with fractions within equations. The most common errors involve:
1.  **Inverse operations on the fraction:** Students often multiply by the numerator and divide by the denominator (leading to Option B).
2.  **Order of operations:** Forgetting that the cube root applies to the entire expression, not just the $V$ (leading to Option D).
3.  **Algebraic "blindness":** Some students simply mix up the positions of $\pi$ and $3$ (Option A).

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often pick options that "look" like the formula components without performing steps. Many will choose B because they see the 4 and 3 but don't know how to move them.
*   **Basic:** Understand they need a cube root, but usually make one algebraic error, often involving the division of $\frac{4}{3}$, leading to the inversion of the 3 and 4.
*   **Proficient:** Generally comfortable with the formula, but a significant minority will make a "slip" when moving the $\pi$ or handling the fraction.
*   **Advanced:** Should find this straightforward, as it is a standard literal equation manipulation. Errors here are rare and usually due to extreme rushing.
