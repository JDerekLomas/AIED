As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as one that specifically tests a student's fluency with inverse operations when fractions are involved. 

The most common error in this specific problem is the "multiplication by the coefficient" trap. Students see the 3 and the 12 and instinctively think $3 \times 4 = 12$ or $12 \div 3 = 4$, leading them to Options A or C. Even proficient students can slip up by multiplying the right side by 3 (yielding $3/12 = 1/4$) instead of dividing. Option B requires the student to correctly perform $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$, which is the same as $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
