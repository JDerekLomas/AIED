To solve for the star ($x$), we substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$ (Option C)

**Teacher's Analysis:**
This question tests the ability to substitute into an implicit linear equation. The decimal $0.5$ is a double-edged sword: it is easy to multiply by $6$, but it often triggers a common error where students accidentally add $3$ to $30$ and get $33$, or subtract $3$ from $30$ and get $27$ (Option D).

The most common mistake at the lower levels will be Option D ($10x = 27$) or Option A ($4.25$). Option A often comes from students confusing $x$ and $y$, or performing the operation $30 \div 6 - 0.5 \times 1.5$ or similar "number scrambling" when they don't know the algebraic steps. Option B is a distractor for those who have a vague notion of negative signs but fail the basic arithmetic. Proficient students usually handle the multiplication of $6 \times 0.5$ well, but the $10x$ step ensures they have to move the decimal point correctly.
