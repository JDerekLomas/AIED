This question targets a common area of confusion in two-step equations: the order of operations when "undoing" steps and the distributive property of multiplication over equality.

**Analysis:**
*   **Tom's method** is the standard "add 5 to both sides" first. This is the most common way students are taught, making it highly recognisable as correct.
*   **Katie's method** involves multiplying by 3 first. However, she has failed to multiply the $-5$ by $3$. The correct line would be $x - 15 = 36$.
*   **The Trap:** Many students (especially at the basic/proficient levels) believe that if you multiply by the denominator, you only multiply the term *containing* the fraction. They see $x/3 \times 3 = x$ and then simply carry the 3 over to the right-hand side, neglecting the middle term.

Because Tom’s step is so obviously "normal" to students, Option A is a very strong distractor for those who don't spot Katie's specific error. Students who are over-confident or "rule-followers" without deep understanding often fall for Katie's logic because $12 \times 3 = 36$ looks "right."
