This question tests the addition of mixed numbers with common denominators. It is considered a relatively straightforward question because it does not require renaming or regrouping (the sum of the fractions is less than 1). However, the inclusion of common "distractor" patterns and the specific instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number" create distinct outcomes for different ability levels.

**Key considerations:**
1.  **The "Add Across" Trap:** Many lower-ability students instinctively add the numerators AND the denominators ($5+5=10$), leading to Option D.
2.  **Improper vs. Mixed Number:** Option B is mathematically correct but violates the instruction to provide a mixed number. Higher-ability students rarely miss this, but basic-level students might calculate it as $18/5$ and stop there.
3.  **Basic Arithmetic:** Option C represents a double error: adding across and failing to account for the whole numbers properly.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
