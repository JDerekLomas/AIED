In this question, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4), but Step 2 contains a very common error: Isaac has added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting it.

This is a classic "sign error" or "inverse operation error." For below-basic and basic students, the leap from $60 = 1 + k$ to $61$ feels intuitive because they see the numbers 60 and 1 and instinctively sum them, or they misapply the rule of "moving" the 1 to the other side without changing the sign. Because Step 1 looks "right" to them (they often handle the multiplication correctly), a large number of students will incorrectly choose Option C.

Higher-ability students will immediately spot the error in Step 2. However, "Only Step 1" (Option A) remains the most likely correct answer for those who can solve linear equations.

**Difficulty Analysis:**
*   **Step 1:** Most students across all levels find multiplying by the denominator straightforward.
*   **Step 2:** This is the "trap." It tests whether a student can maintain algebraic rigor during a simple subtraction. Many mid-range students rush this and assume Isaac is correct.
*   **Option B and D:** Very few students choose these because Step 1 is visibly correct to most.
