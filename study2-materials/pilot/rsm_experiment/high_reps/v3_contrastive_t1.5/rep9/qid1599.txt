This question tests the transition from arithmetic notation ($\div$) to algebraic notation (the fraction bar). While it seems straightforward, the presence of brackets $(h+4)$ tests the student's understanding of the "package" nature of the denominator.

**Analysis of misconceptions:**
*   **Option B:** This is a rare error where students feel "c" needs an operation to match the $+4$ on the bottom, but it's less likely than C or D.
*   **Option C:** This is a very common error for students who follow left-to-right processing without understanding that the vinculum (fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol. They see $c \div h$ first, then the $+4$.
*   **Option D:** This is the "order of division" error, where students mistakenly put the divisor on top, often because they prefer the "more complex" expression to be the numerator.

**Predicted Performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often struggle with the "visual" look of algebra. Many will pick D because the larger term looks "sturdier" on top, or C because it looks most like the original linear horizontal string.
*   **Basic:** Generally understand that the fraction bar replaces the divide sign, but frequently flip the numerator and denominator (D) or fail to group the $(h+4)$ correctly (C).
*   **Proficient:** Should handle this well, though a small percentage will still make a "reflex" error choosing D or C under time pressure.
*   **Advanced:** This is a "giveaway" question for this level; they see the fraction bar and grouping as synonymous.
