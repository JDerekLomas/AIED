This question targets two primary areas of difficulty for UK students: the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and arithmetic with decimals.

The most common error in this specific problem is applying the multiplication ($3 \times 0.3$) before the squaring, resulting in $(0.9)^2 = 0.81$ (Option A). This is a classic "linear processing" error where students read left-to-right.

Option C represents the "forgot to square" or "multiplied by the power" error ($3 \times 0.3 \times 2 = 1.8$), which is common among students who confuse indices with coefficients. Option B is a misplacement of the decimal point during the squaring process ($0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$, then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$). While Option B is the correct numerical result of $3(0.3)^2$, many lower-ability students will struggle to correctly place the decimal point and may opt for D simply because $3^2 \times 3 = 27$ feels "more right" than $0.27$.

Advanced students will recognise the need to square $0.3$ first to get $0.09$, then multiply by $3$ to get $0.27$.
