This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. Even though the numbers are small, it is surprisingly difficult for lower-ability students. 

The most common error is **procedural inversion**. Students see the numbers 10 and 5 and intuitively think "10 divided by 5 equals 2," ignoring the algebraic position of $p$. This leads many to Option C. Those who attempt to "rearrange" but lack confidence often multiply the two numbers, leading to Option B. Option A requires the correct algebraic step ($10p = 5$, therefore $p = 5/10$) or the insight that 5 must be divided by a smaller number to result in a larger one.

While "proficient" students handle the fraction swap well, "below basic" students almost always default to the easiest division possible with the digits provided.

below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=55% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
