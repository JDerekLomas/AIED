This is a relatively straightforward addition of mixed numbers because the denominators are common and there is no regrouping required (the sum of the fractions is less than one whole).

The main "traps" here are:
1.  **D (The common denominator error):** Students adding the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$). This is the most prevalent misconception in fraction addition at lower ability levels.
2.  **B (Form error):** Students successfully calculating the value but giving it as an improper fraction rather than the requested mixed number.
3.  **C (Double error):** Students adding denominators and numerators while ignoring the whole numbers, or making multiple calculation slips.

However, because the whole numbers are so easy ($2+1=3$) and the numerators are so easy ($1+2=3$), a high proportion of students across the board will find their way to option A.
