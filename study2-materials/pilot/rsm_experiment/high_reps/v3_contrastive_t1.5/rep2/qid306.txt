This question addresses two major aspects of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS): the priority of multiplication over addition, and the left-to-right convention for addition and subtraction.

**Problem Q** is the standard test for the "Multiplication before Addition" rule. Most students (except those at the below_basic level) have this drilled into them.

**Problem P** is the "trap" for students who follow the acronym too literally. Many students believe that because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in BIDMAS, they must add before they subtract. Therefore, they incorrectly believe they must do $5+6$ first. In reality, addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be performed from left to right ($4-5$ first).

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
- **Below Basic:** These students often work strictly left-to-right regardless of operators, leading them to Option A.
- **Basic:** These students have learned the acronym but take it literally. They will recognise multiplication comes first in Q, but will wrongly think addition must come first in P. This makes **Option D** a very strong distractor for this cohort.
- **Proficient:** These students generally understand the priority of multiplication but are still split on the equal priority of addition and subtraction.
- **Advanced:** These students understand that addition/subtraction are processed left-to-right and multiplication/division are processed left-to-right.

below_basic: A=50% B=20% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=5% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=2% D=33%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=1% D=7%
