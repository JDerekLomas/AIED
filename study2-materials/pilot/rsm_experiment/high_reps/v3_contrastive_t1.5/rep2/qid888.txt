This quadratic expansion question tests two key areas: the "FOIL" method (or grid method) and the manipulation of directed numbers.

What makes this specific question tricky for students is the "double negative" for the constant term $(-5 \times -7 = +35)$ and the "adding negatives" for the linear term $(-5 + -7 = -12)$.

*   **Option A** represents a student who subtracts the numbers instead of adding them ($7-5=2$) or simply doesn't understand the process.
*   **Option B** is the correct answer.
*   **Option C** is a very common error where students think "two negatives make a positive" applies to both the middle term and the end term.
*   **Option D** is the most frequent "near-miss" error, where students correctly calculate $-5 - 7 = -12$ but fail to realize that $-5 \times -7$ must be positive 35.
