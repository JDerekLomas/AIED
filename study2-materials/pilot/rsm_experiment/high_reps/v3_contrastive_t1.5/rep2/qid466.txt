This question specifically tests the understanding of multiplicative inverses (reciprocals) in the context of negative numbers. 

The most common trap here is the "sign-change" misconception. Students often confuse the rule for perpendicular gradients (negative reciprocal) with the rule for a multiplicative inverse (where the sign must stay the same to result in a positive 1, or in this case, a specific sign result). Because the target is $-1$, and the starting value is negative, the multiplier must be positive. This requires students to navigate two distinct concepts: fraction inversion and sign rules.

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level often guess based on visual similarity. Many will choose **D** (just repeating the number) or **C** (changing only the sign).
*   **Basic:** These students usually recognize that a reciprocal is needed because of the $3/4$ and the $1$, leading them to focus on **A** and **B**. However, many will reflexively think "to get to 1, I need to flip it and change the sign," leading them to the incorrect **B**.
*   **Proficient:** These students will perform the calculation (negative $\times$ positive = negative) and correctly identify that **A** preserves the negative sign of the product.
*   **Advanced:** These students will immediately recognize the equation as $Ax = -1$, meaning $x = -1/A$, and will not be tripped up by the signs.
