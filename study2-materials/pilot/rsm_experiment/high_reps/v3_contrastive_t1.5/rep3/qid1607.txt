In this equation, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4 to get $60 = 1 + k$). However, Step 2 is incorrect; instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$, Isaac has added 1, resulting in $k=61$ instead of $k=59$.

This is a classic "rear-end" error in two-step equations. Below-basic students often see the "$+k$" and the "1" and instinctively add them to the 60, or they simply assume that if the first step looks mathematically sound (60 is a multiple of 15), the whole process must be correct, leading them to choice C. Proficient students usually spot the sign error in Step 2, while advanced students identify it almost instantly.
