This question is a classic test of how students handle the number zero in a dataset and their understanding of the order of operations.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A is correct.** $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$. Dividing the sum by 5 is correct because there are 5 data points.
*   **B is the "Calculator Trap."** If a student types $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$ into a scientific calculator without brackets, the calculator performs $7 \div 5$ first. Many students ignore BIDMAS/BODMAS in written form.
*   **C is the "Zero doesn't count" misconception.** Students often believe that because zero doesn't change the sum, it shouldn't be counted as an item in the denominator.
*   **D is for students who don't see "0" in the numerator of A** and assume it's missing a step, or those who are confused by the horizontal fraction bar versus the division sign.

**Predicting performance:**
Lower-ability students frequently forget that zero is a "value" in a frequency sense, making C very attractive. Middle-ability students often fall for B because it "looks" like the right sequence of buttons to press. High-ability students will recognise that adding zero doesn't change the numerator, so A is mathematically sound.
