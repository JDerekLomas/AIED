As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on how students handle negative numbers and algebraic operations. The question specifically isolates the multiplication of the constants: $(-1) \times (-4)$.

The primary trap here isn't the algebra itself, but the operation choice (adding instead of multiplying) and the sign rule (negative $\times$ negative). 

- **Below Basic** students often confuse expanding with collecting terms, leading them to perform $-1 - 4 = -5$ or $-1 + (-4) = -5$. They also frequently struggle with the "double negative" rule.
- **Basic** students usually know they must multiply, but the pressure of directed numbers often leads to the mistake $(-1) \times (-4) = -4$ because they see the minus signs and feel the result "must" be negative.
- **Proficient** students are generally solid on "two negatives make a positive" in multiplication, though a small percentage might still make a "sign slip" under test conditions.
- **Advanced** students will see this as a trivial component of a larger FOIL/Grid method expansion and will almost certainly get $+4$.

The absence of $p$ in the options simplifies things, as it prevents the error of adding $p$ into the constant term.

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=5% D=40%
basic: A=55% B=25% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
