This question tests a student's ability to rearrange a formula involving a cube root and fractions. While the formula for the volume of a sphere ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) is usually provided in the exam or expected to be known, the difficulty here lies in the algebraic manipulation of moving the $\frac{4}{3}$ and the $\pi$ to the other side of the equation.

**Analysis of student errors:**
*   **The common trap (Option A):** Students often multiply by the numerator and divide by the denominator instinctively, or fail to recognise that $\pi$ is in the "numerator" of the fraction $\frac{4\pi r^3}{3}$. This leads them to multiply $V$ by $4\pi$.
*   **The $\pi$ placement (Option B):** Some students correctly swap the 3 and 4 but forget that $\pi$ is "attached" to the $r^3$ and should end up in the denominator.
*   **Conceptual error (Option D):** Lower-ability students often struggle with the order of operations, thinking they can pull the constant out of the cube root or failing to root the entire expression.
*   **The correct answer (Option C):** Requires multiplying by 3, dividing by $4\pi$, and then taking the cube root.
