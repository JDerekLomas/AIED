As a UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because of how the equation $4x + 2y = 10$ is presented. Most students are more comfortable with the $y = mx + c$ format. 

**Analysis of the Question:**
1.  **The $x=0$ factor:** This is the saving grace for many. By setting $x=0$, the $4x$ term disappears. This turns a complex rearrangement task into a simple division: $2y = 10$.
2.  **The "5" trap (Option C):** This is the correct answer ($10 \div 2$).
3.  **The "2.5" trap (Option D):** Many students instinctively divide the total by the coefficient of $x$ (doing $10 \div 4$) or simply see the numbers 10, 4, and 2 and perform a calculation involving all of them.
4.  **The "3" trap (Option B):** Students might try to solve by "inspection" or subtract 4 then 2, or make a mental arithmetic error involving $10 - 4$.
5.  **The "20" trap (Option A):** This appeals to "below basic" students who see 4, 2, and 10 and try to combine them via multiplication ($4 \times 5$ or similar) without understanding the substitution.

While this looks like an algebra question, at $x=0$, it is actually a "half of 10" question. However, the presence of the $4x$ term and the non-standard formatting of the linear equation will cause significant hesitation for lower-ability students.
