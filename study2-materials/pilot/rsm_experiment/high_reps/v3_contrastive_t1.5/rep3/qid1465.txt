This question is a classic test of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). 

The correct path is to perform the multiplication first: $3 - 5 + 8$. Then, working from left to right, $3 - 5 = -2$, and $-2 + 8 = 6$ (Option A).

However, many students struggle with two specific areas here:
1. **Misapplication of addition/subtraction priority:** Some students believe "Addition comes before Subtraction" because the 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS. They calculate $5 + 8 = 13$, then $3 - 13 = -10$ (Option D).
2. **Left-to-right processing (ignoring order):** Lower-ability students often work straight across: $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$ (Option B).
3. **Bracketing errors:** Those who calculate $3 - 5 = -2$ and $4 \times 2 = 8$ but then treat it as a product $-2 \times 8$ or make a sign error leading to -12 (Option C).

The most common trap for average students is D, while the most common trap for lower-ability students is B.
