This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. While mathematically straightforward, it is a significant hurdle for students at lower ability levels because it breaks the "multiply to undo division" habit in a way that often leads to a specific error.

The most common mistake is students seeing $10$ and $5$ and immediately performing the calculation $10 \div 5$ because they are conditioned to see the larger number as the dividend, or they perform $10 \times 5$ because they see the fraction bar and automatically want to "clear" it by multiplying everything. 

**Option C ($p=2$)** is the primary "distractor" trap, where students perform $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$.
**Option B ($p=50$)** is for those who multiply $10 \times 5$, which is a very common reflex for students who have just learned to solve basic one-step equations like $x/5 = 10$.
**Option A ($p=0.5$)** is the correct answer ($5/10$), which requires the student to correctly rearrange the formula to $p = 5/10$.
