As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on common classroom behaviours and the specific structure of the distractors.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
The question tests addition of mixed numbers. There are two primary pitfalls: the "add the tops, add the bottoms" error (leading to Option D) and the conversion between improper fractions and mixed numbers. 

Option **B** is the correct mixed number answer ($4 \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$). 
Option **A** is the correct numerical value but as an improper fraction ($\frac{99}{20}$). Because the question explicitly asks to "Leave your answer as a mixed number," many proficient students who convert to improper fractions first might stop at A, but most will notice the prompt. 
Option **D** is the classic "Basic" error ($2+2=4$ and $7+1=8, 10+4=14$). 
Option **C** represents a common mistake where students find a common denominator by multiplying (40) but fail to adjust numerators correctly or simply guess.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=20% D=50%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
