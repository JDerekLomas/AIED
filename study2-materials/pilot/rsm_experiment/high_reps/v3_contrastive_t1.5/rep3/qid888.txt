This question is a classic test of expanding double brackets with negative terms. The key "tripwires" here are the arithmetic of directed numbers: summing $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$, and multiplying $-5$ by $-7$ to get $+35$.

Option A targets students who confuse the rules for adding and multiplying (performing $-7 + 5$ or similar). Option C is for those who believe two negatives always make a positive, even when adding. Option D is the most common mistake for "basic" and "proficient" students: they correctly add $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12m$, but then incorrectly multiply to get $-35$, either through a lapse in concentration or the common misconception that "a negative and a negative make a negative."

Because the numbers 5 and 7 are small and familiar, advanced students will rarely miss this, but the signs remain a significant barrier for those at the lower ability levels.

basic: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
