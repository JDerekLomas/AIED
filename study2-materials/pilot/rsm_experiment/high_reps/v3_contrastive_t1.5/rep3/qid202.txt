This is an entry-level mixed number addition question. Because the denominators are the same and the sum of the fractional parts does not exceed a whole ($1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5$), the cognitive load is significantly lower than a standard fraction addition problem. 

The primary "trap" for lower-ability students is the treatment of the denominator. Many students at the **below_basic** level reflexively add the denominators (5+5=10), leading them to Option D. Option B ($18/5$) is the correct value but improper; the instruction explicitly asks for a mixed number. While **proficient** students will see B as the correct value, they are trained to follow the instruction for "mixed number" and will mostly choose A. **Advanced** students will rarely miss this.

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=88% B=7% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=97% B=2% C=0% D=1%
