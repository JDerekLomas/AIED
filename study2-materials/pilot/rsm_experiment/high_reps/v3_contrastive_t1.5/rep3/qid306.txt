This question is a classic test of the "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and uncovers two very specific developmental hurdles in secondary school mathematics.

**Problem P ($4-5+6$)** tests the common misconception that Addition must always be performed before Subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS. In reality, they have equal priority and should be done left-to-right. This is the primary "trap" for mid-to-high ability students who have learned the acronym but not the nuanced rule.
**Problem Q ($4+5 \times 6$)** tests the standard hierarchy of Multiplication over Addition. This is generally better understood than the P-addition trap.

**Why the options matter:**
- **Option B** is the correct mathematical procedure (Left-to-right for P, MD for Q).
- **Option D** is the most common error for students who follow BIDMAS strictly as a literal sequence (A then S).
- **Option A** represents a total lack of order of operations knowledge (performing both left-to-right).

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=5% D=35%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=5% D=50%
proficient: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
advanced: A=2% B=85% C=1% D=12%

**Teacher’s Note:**
Even "advanced" students in the UK often hesitate on $4-5+6$. Many have been taught to "group the additions," leading them to incorrectly calculate $5+6$ first (Option D). However, because $5 \times 6$ is so clearly the priority in Problem Q, the "A" and "C" distractors (which suggest adding $4+5$ first) are mostly ignored by anyone who has reached 'Proficient' level. The battle here is almost entirely between B and D.
