As an experienced UK maths teacher, I’ve analyzed this specific algebraic fractions question. 

The key difficulty here is the uneven denominators ($2x$ and $x$). Students must recognize that the common denominator is $2x$, requiring the second fraction to be scaled by a factor of 2.

*   **Option A (Correct):** Students multiply $\frac{4}{x}$ by $\frac{2}{2}$ to get $\frac{8}{2x}$, then add: $\frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.
*   **Option B:** Represents the "add across" misconception: $3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$. This is very common among weaker students.
*   **Option C:** This is a partial success where students get the numerator $11$ but fail to maintain the common denominator of $2x$ (perhaps thinking the $x$ from the second fraction is the "final" variable).
*   **Option D:** This is the most common error for mid-ability students. They correctly identified the common denominator as $2x$, but forgot to multiply the numerator of the second fraction by 2 ($3/2x + 4/2x = 7/2x$).

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=55% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=5% D=40%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=2% D=18%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
