This question tests the transition from arithmetic notation ($\div$) to algebraic notation (fraction bar). It specifically checks whether students understand that the division bar acts as a grouping symbol for the entire divisor $(h+4)$.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **The Grouping Trap (Option C):** This is the most common error for students who think the fraction bar only applies to the term immediately preceding/following it, effectively misinterpreting BIDMAS or the role of the brackets.
*   **The Reciprocal Trap (Option D):** Many students struggle with the direction of division, reflexively putting the "longer" expression on top or simply swapping the numerator and denominator.
*   **The Random Term Trap (Option B):** This catches students who try to balance or "match" parts of the expression by adding digits to the numerator.
*   **Difficulty Level:** This specific question is relatively straightforward because the brackets are explicitly present in the prompt. If the brackets were absent, the success rate for Option A would plummet.
