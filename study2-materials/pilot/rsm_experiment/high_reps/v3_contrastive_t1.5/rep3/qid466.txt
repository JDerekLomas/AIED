This question tests the "multiplicative inverse" (reciprocals) alongside the rules of multiplying directed numbers. 

The main hurdle for students is the negative sign. A student must recognize that for the result to be negative ($ -1 $), and for the first term to already be negative ($ -3/4 $), the second term must be positive because $(\text{negative}) \times (\text{positive}) = (\text{negative})$.

*   **Option A** is the correct multiplicative inverse.
*   **Option B** is a very common trap; students know they need the "flipped" fraction but incorrectly assume that because the target is negative, they must include a negative sign in the multiplier, forgetting that two negatives would make a positive.
*   **Options C and D** are for students who confuse addition/identity properties or simply do not know how to "undo" a multiplication.

Below basic students often pick C or D because they see $3/4$ in the question and look for a familiar number. Basic/Proficient students frequently fall for the "Double Negative" trap in Option B.

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=45% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=30% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=7% C=1% D=0%
