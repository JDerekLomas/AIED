This question is a classic test of the "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and specifically targets the most persistent misconception regarding the hierarchy of addition and subtraction.

In Problem P ($4-5+6$), many students wrongly believe that because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, addition must be performed before subtraction. This leads them to mistakenly believe they should do $5+6$ first (Options C and D). In reality, addition and subtraction have equal priority and are solved left-to-right.

In Problem Q ($4+5 \times 6$), students must identify that multiplication takes precedence over addition. Option B is the correct answer.

**Key difficulties for this specific question:**
1. **The BIDMAS trap:** The letters A and S in BIDMAS suggest a sequence that doesn't exist. This is a very common "learned" error among basic and proficient students.
2. **Double Identification:** Students must get two rules right simultaneously. A student might know to multiply first in Q but still fail the "left-to-right" rule in P.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=15% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=2% B=92% C=1% D=5%

**Analysis:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with any order of operations, frequently just working left-to-right regardless of operators, or picking D because they've been told "addition and multiplication are important."
*   **Basic:** This group usually knows multiplication comes before addition (eliminating A and C), but almost half will fall for the "Addition before Subtraction" trap, leading them to D.
*   **Proficient:** Most understand the priority of multiplication. However, a significant minority (approx. 25%) still harbor the misconception that Addition *always* precedes Subtraction due to the mnemonic.
*   **Advanced:** These students recognise that Addition/Subtraction are equal priority and correctly identify that Problem P is worked left-to-right.
