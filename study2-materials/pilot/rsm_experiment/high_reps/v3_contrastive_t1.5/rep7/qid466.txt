This question tests two distinct concepts: the property of **multiplicative inverses (reciprocals)** and the **rules of signs for multiplication**.

The "trap" here is the negative sign. A student who understands that $1$ is the result of multiplying reciprocals may choose Option A, forgetting that a negative multiplied by a positive remains negative. Students at lower ability levels often see the target value of $-1$ and the negative in the question, then erroneously conclude that the missing value should be positive to "keep the negative sign there," failing to realise that a positive $\times$ negative is required to result in a negative.

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** High confusion between adding to get zero and multiplying to get one. Many will pick C or D thinking they need to "match" the numbers they see.
*   **Basic:** Will recognise the need for the reciprocal ($\frac{4}{3}$) but will likely get the sign wrong, gravitating towards A because they think "the question is negative, so I need a positive to keep it negative."
*   **Proficient:** Generally understand reciprocals and sign rules, though a significant minority will make a "careless" sign error (Option B).
*   **Advanced:** Should find this straightforward, but occasionally "overthink" and select B if they misread the target as $+1$.
