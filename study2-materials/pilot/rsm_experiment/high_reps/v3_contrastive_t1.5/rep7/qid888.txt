This question tests the expansion of a quadratic expression where both constants are negative. This is a common stumbling block for students, primarily due to the rules of directed numbers rather than the process of FOIL (First, Outside, Inside, Last) or the grid method.

**Analysis:**
1.  **The $m^2$ term:** This is consistent across all options, so it provides no challenge.
2.  **The Middle Term (-12m):** Students must combine $-5m$ and $-7m$. Those who struggle with adding negatives often get $+12$ (Option C) or perform a subtraction $(-7 - (-5))$ to get $-2$ (Option A).
3.  **The Constant Term (+35):** This is the biggest "trap." Students often remember "a negative and a negative make a positive," but under the pressure of an exam, they frequently apply it inconsistently or forget it for the multiplication step. Options A and D represent the "-35" error.

**Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often pick A or D because they see "minus" signs in the question and assume the answer must have at least one minus sign at the end. They struggle with $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$.
*   **Basic:** Usually get the "12" but are highly likely to struggle with the signs. C is a very popular "distractor" for those who think the two negatives "cancel out" across the whole equation.
*   **Proficient:** Understand the process well but may still make a "sign slip" resulting in D.
*   **Advanced:** Almost always get this right; they have internalized that a negative times a negative is a positive.

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%
