To predict the performance on this question, we must look at the algebraic manipulation required to rearrange $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

**Analysis:**
This is a high-demand "rearranging formulae" question. Even for students who know the sphere volume formula (which is usually provided on a formula sheet in UK exams), the multi-step process to isolate $r$ is a significant hurdle. 
1. **The $4/3$ trap:** Many students struggle with dividing by a fraction. Instead of multiplying by 3 and dividing by 4, they often move the numbers incorrectly (Option B).
2. **The $\pi$ location:** A very common error is failing to realize that $\pi$ is in the "numerator" of the term ($4\pi/3$). 
3. **The Cube Root:** While most realize a cube root is needed, less proficient students often fail to extend the radical symbol over the entire expression, leading to choices like D.
4. **Option C** is the correct rearrangement ($3V$ over $4\pi$ before rooting).

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
*Students at this level are largely guessing or picking options that look "maths-heavy." There is no clear grasp of the inverse operations required.*

basic: A=20% B=35% C=25% D=20%
*Students often remember the $4/3$ and $\pi$, but frequently incorrectly group them. Option B is a very attractive distractor here as they often forget $\pi$ moves to the denominator with the 4.*

proficient: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
*Proficient students (Grade 6/7) usually perform the steps: $3V$, then divide by $4\pi$, then cube root. However, a significant minority will still make a slip with the fraction coefficient.*

advanced: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
*Advanced students (Grade 8/9) are highly fluent in changing the subject of a formula. Errors here are usually due to haste rather than a lack of understanding.*
