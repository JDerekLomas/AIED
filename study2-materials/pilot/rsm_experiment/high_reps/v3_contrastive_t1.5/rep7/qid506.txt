As an experienced teacher, I've seen many students struggle with linear equations when the coefficient is an integer but the constant is a fraction.

The most common trap here is **Option A**. Students see the numbers 3 and 12 and immediately think "12 divided by 3 is 4," leading them to $1/4$ because there is a fraction bar involved. They incorrectly apply the inverse operation by "moving" the 3 and dividing the denominator rather than multiplying it.

**Option C** is the classic "multiplication vs. division" error, where students ignore the fraction structure entirely and treat $1/12$ as 12, or perform $3 \times 12$. 

**Option D** occurs when students mistakenly think they need to find a number that, when multiplied by 3, gives 12, or they simply subtract/square 3.

The correct answer **Option B** ($1/36$) requires understanding that to solve $3p = 1/12$, you must divide both sides by 3, which is equivalent to multiplying the denominator by 3 ($1/12 \div 3 = 1/36$).
