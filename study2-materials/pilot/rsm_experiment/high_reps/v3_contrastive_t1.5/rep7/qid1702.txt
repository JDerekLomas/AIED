To solve this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into $10x - 6y = 30$. This results in $10x - 3 = 30$, which simplifies to $10x = 33$, hence $x = 3.3$.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **C (3.3)** is the correct answer.
*   **D (2.7)** is the most common error. This occurs when students incorrectly handle the negative sign or the direction of operations (e.g., $10x + 3 = 30$ leading to $10x = 27$). Many students see the minus sign and think they must subtract from 30 rather than add.
*   **A (4.25)** and **B (-4.25)** are "distractor-heavy" results often derived from incorrectly substituting $0.5$ for $x$ instead of $y$, or making major errors in manipulating the linear equation (e.g., $10x = 30 + 12.5$ or similar).

**Difficulty Breakdown:**
Lower-ability students (Below Basic/Basic) often struggle with two-step linear equations when one term is negative and the result involves a decimal. They are highly susceptible to "operation flipping" (getting 2.7 instead of 3.3). Advanced students will recognize this as a simple substitution and 1-decimal-place division.
