This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. Even though the numbers are small, the structure causes significant difficulty for students who rely on intuitive arithmetic rather than formal algebraic manipulation.

The most common error is the "division by 10" trap. Students see the 10 and the 5 and automatically calculate $10 \div 5 = 2$. This makes Option C the strongest distractor. Students who "cross-multiply" incorrectly (multiplying the 10 and 5) will choose B. Option A requires the student to correctly identify that $5 \div 0.5 = 10$, or to rearrange the equation to $10p = 5$, which many lower-ability students struggle to do.

Historically, this specific structure ($a = \frac{b}{x}$ where $a > b$) has a lower success rate than many expect because the answer is a fraction/decimal.
