This question tests two distinct areas: the understanding of index notation (powers) and the application of signs when raising negative numbers to an even power.

The most common error in this specific question is the "sign error" ($(-3)^4 = -81$). This occurs because many students calculate $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$ and then incorrectly apply the negative sign from the base to the final answer, or they are misled by how some non-scientific calculators handle $-3^4$. The second most common error is the "multiplication error" ($3 \times 4 = 12$).

**Predictive Analysis:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often confuse powers with multiplication. D is a very common trap for them ($k \times 4$), followed by B.
*   **Basic:** These students understand that they need to multiply 3 four times, but they frequently struggle with the rules of negative signs. C is the "intended" trap here and will be very popular.
*   **Proficient:** These students generally know that an even power results in a positive answer, but a significant minority will still rush and choose -81 out of habit or lack of care with parentheses.
*   **Advanced:** These students will recognise that $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = +81$ and are unlikely to be caught out by the sign or the operation.
