This question targets two primary areas of difficulty: the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and decimal multiplication.

The core conflict is between the correct operation $3 \times (0.3^2) = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$ and the common mistake of multiplying before squaring: $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$. 

Additionally, many students struggle with the placement of the decimal point when squaring 0.3. A common error is thinking $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, which leads to $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ (Option D). Option C ($1.8$) represents a double-error or a confusion with $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$, mistaking the square for a multiplier.

**Why this is difficult:**
*   **Decimal Squaring:** Even "proficient" students often reflexively say $0.3^2 = 0.9$.
*   **Order of Operations:** The proximity of the 3 to the $x$ makes it look like a single term $(3x)$, leading students to evaluate the product first.
