As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've seen many students tackle the "FOIL" or grid method for expanding brackets. This specific question targets the "Last" terms of $(2p - 1)(3p - 4)$.

The primary difficulty here is not the algebra itself, but the integer arithmetic involving two negative numbers. 

1.  **The Multiplication vs. Addition Error:** Many "below basic" students see $-1$ and $-4$ and intuitively combine them to get $-5$ (as if adding) or $+5$ (incorrectly applying a "two negatives make a plus" rule to addition).
2.  **The Sign Error:** Students who know they must multiply $1 \times 4$ often struggle with $(-1) \times (-4)$, leading to the very common mistake of $-4$.
3.  **Simplicity of the visual:** Because the arrows point specifically to the numbers and don't involve the variables ($p$), this removes the complexity of powers, which usually keeps "proficient" students from making silly mistakes.

This is a classic "trap" question where the arithmetic is the hurdle, not the algebraic concept.

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=55% B=25% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
