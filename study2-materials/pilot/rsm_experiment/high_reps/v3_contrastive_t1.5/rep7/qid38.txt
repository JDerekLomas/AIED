As a UK maths teacher, I’ve seen thousands of students tackle algebraic fractions. Here is my analysis for this specific question:

**Analysis:**
This question tests the ability to find a common denominator where one denominator is a multiple of the other. 
- **Option A (Correct):** Students must multiply $\frac{4}{x}$ by $\frac{2}{2}$ to get $\frac{8}{2x}$, then add $3+8$. 
- **Option B (The "Add everything" trap):** This is the classic misconception where students add the numerators ($3+4=7$) and add the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). 
- **Option D (The "Half-way" trap):** Students recognise they need $2x$ as the denominator, but forget to double the numerator of the second fraction, simply adding $3+4=7$.
- **Option C:** This is less common but occurs if students incorrectly "simplify" $2x$ or lose the factor of 2 during the process.

The jump from numeric fractions to algebraic ones usually triggers "Option B" for lower-ability students. For middle-ability students, "Option D" is the most common mistake because they often "see" the $2x$ as the denominator but lack the procedural fluency to adjust the numerator accordingly.
