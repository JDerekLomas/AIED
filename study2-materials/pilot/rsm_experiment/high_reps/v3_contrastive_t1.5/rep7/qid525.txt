As a UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common classroom performance.

**Key Insights for this specific question:**
1.  **The "Mixed Number" trap:** The instruction asks for the answer as a mixed number. This makes Option A ($ \frac{99}{20} $) a significant distractor. It is mathematically correct but violates the form requested. Proficiency levels often correlate with how well students read the final instruction.
2.  **Common denominators:** $10$ and $4$ are "friendly" enough for most students to reach $20$. However, students at lower ability levels frequently simply add the numerators and denominators ($7+1$ and $10+4$), leading to Option D ($4 \frac{8}{14}$).
3.  **Basic arithmetic errors:** Option C represents a confusion in finding a common denominator (often just multiplying $10 \times 4$) combined with an incorrect conversion of the improper fraction.
4.  **Advanced students:** They will calculate the sum accurately and notice the instruction for a mixed number, leading them almost exclusively to B.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
