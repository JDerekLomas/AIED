This question tests the transition from arithmetic notation ($\div$) to algebraic notation (the fraction bar). While it seems straightforward, the presence of brackets $(h+4)$ creates a specific structural challenge for students who struggle with "keeping things together" in a fraction.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **A (Correct):** Students need to recognise that the divisor $(h+4)$ moves entirely to the denominator.
*   **B (Misconception - Distribution error):** Some students mistakenly think they need to add the constant to the numerator as well, or they get confused by the visual layout.
*   **C (Misconception - Order of Operations/Hierarchy):** This is a very common error. Students see "divide by $h$" and then "add 4", effectively ignoring the brackets. They don't realise the vinculum (fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol.
*   **D (Misconception - Commutativity error):** This is for students who know it's a fraction but are unsure which variable goes on top, often choosing based on alphabetical order or simply flipping them.

In this specific question, Option C is the most potent distractor for middle-attaining students. However, because the question specifically uses brackets $c \div (h+4)$, it explicitly directs the student to keep $h+4$ together, making it slightly easier than if the question had been written without brackets (where the error in C would be even more prevalent).
