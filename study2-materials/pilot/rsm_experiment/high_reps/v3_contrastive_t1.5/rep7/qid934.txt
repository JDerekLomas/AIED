As a UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because of how the equation is presented. Unlike the more common $y = mx + c$ format, this is in the form $ax + by = c$, which requires students to either substitute $x=0$ and solve or rearrange the equation first.

The specific numbers in this question make it easier for those who know to substitute: when $x=0$, the term $4x$ disappears entirely. However, the traps are well-placed. Option A ($20$) is the result of multiplying the coefficients ($4 \times 5$). Option B ($3$) is a common "logic" error where students see $4+2y=10$, conclude $2y=6$, and get $3$. Option D ($2.5$) is for students who divide the constant ($10$) by the coefficient of $x$ ($4$). Option C is correct as $2y = 10 \implies y = 5$.

The most common error for low-ability students is often "ignoring" the zero and simply combining the other visible numbers or confusing $x=0$ with $x=1$.

**Teacher's Insight:** The "star" is in the $y$-column corresponding to $x=0$, which is the y-intercept. Most proficient students will quickly identify that $2y=10$, but below-basic students often struggle with the "missing" $x$ value.

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=55% D=20%
proficient: A=2% B=8% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=97% D=1%
