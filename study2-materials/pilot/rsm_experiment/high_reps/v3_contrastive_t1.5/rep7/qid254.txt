As a UK maths teacher, I have analysed this specific question. The presence of the **zero** is the primary "distractor" here. 

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A is the correct calculation.** Adding the zero doesn't change the sum, but it must be counted in the divisor (5). 
*   **C is the classic "Zero doesn't count" misconception.** Students often ignore zero when counting how many items are in a set.
*   **B tests BIDMAS/Order of Operations.** Without brackets, only the 7 is divided by 5. While mathematically incorrect for the mean, weaker students often type exactly this into a non-scientific calculator or write it horizontally without thinking about priority.
*   **D is for students who are overthinking.** They might be looking for $(0+1+3+4+7) \div 5$ and, not seeing the zero in the numerator of A, assume it’s wrong, even though $0+x=x$.

This question is actually quite difficult for "Basic" students because the absence of the "0" in the numerator of Option A makes them feel it is "incomplete," even though the denominator (5) is correct.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=5% D=2%
