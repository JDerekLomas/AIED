In this question, Isaac performs two operations. Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4 to get $60 = 1 + k$). However, in Step 2, he makes a common "change the side, change the sign" error. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to get 59, he adds 1 to 60 to get 61.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **Step 1:** Most students across all ability levels recognize that you should multiply by the denominator. Only the lowest-attaining students might think you subtract 4 or multiply only one side.
*   **Step 2:** This is the "trap." Students who struggle with inverse operations often see the "$+1$" and, in their haste to move it, perform the operation they see ($60 + 1$) rather than the inverse ($60 - 1$).
*   **Lower ability students** often see an answer that "looks" like it uses the right numbers (60 and 1 making 61) and assume the whole process is correct (Option C).
*   **Middle ability (Proficient) students** are generally good at identifying the first step but frequently fall for the sign error in Step 2. This makes Option A a very strong distractor for them, but a significant portion will still pick C because they don't check the arithmetic carefully.
*   **Advanced students** will immediately spot the sign error in Step 2 and correctly identify that only Step 1 is valid.
