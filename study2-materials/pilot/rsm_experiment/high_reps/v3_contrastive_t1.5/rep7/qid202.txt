This question is a straightforward addition of mixed numbers where the denominators are already the same and the sum of the fractional parts does not exceed a whole. However, the presence of specific distractors tests whether students understand the rules of fraction addition (not adding denominators) and whether they follow the specific instruction regarding the format of the answer.

**Key considerations for this specific question:**
1. **The "Denominators" Trap:** Option D ($3 \frac{3}{10}$) is the classic error where students add both the numerators and the denominators ($1+2=3$ and $5+5=10$). This is very common at below_basic and basic levels.
2. **The "Format" Trap:** Option B is the correct value ($\frac{18}{5}$), but it is an improper fraction. The question specifically asks for a "mixed number." Proficient students usually spot this, but basic students often stop as soon as they see a mathematically equivalent value.
3. **Complexity:** Because there is no "carrying" (the sum is $\frac{3}{5}$, not greater than 1), the "Separate Whole Numbers" method is very easy to apply here, which boosts the success rate for proficient students.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=55% B=15% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=97% B=2% C=0% D=1%
