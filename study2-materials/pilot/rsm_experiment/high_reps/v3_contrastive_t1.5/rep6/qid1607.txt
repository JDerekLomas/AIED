In this equation, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4 to get $60 = 1 + k$). However, Step 2 contains a very common "balancing" error: instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$, the student has added 1, resulting in 61 instead of 59.

This is a classic "sign error" or "inverse operation error" often seen at Key Stage 3 and GCSE Foundation level. Lower-ability students often struggle to identify where a mistake occurred if they see a number that "looks" right (61 feels related to 60 and 1). Advanced students will mentally solve it ($59+1=60$) and immediately spot the error in Step 2. Mid-ability students often correctly identify Step 1 but are susceptible to agreeing with Step 2 because they perform the same addition error themselves.
