As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've analysed this question based on the typical behaviours of Key Stage 3 and GCSE students.

This question tests three distinct skills: common denominators, adding whole numbers separately from fractions, and the ability to follow instructions regarding the format of the answer.

**Option D** is the classic "add the numerators, add the denominators" trap ($7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$). This is the most common error for below-basic and basic students.
**Option B** is the correct answer. 
**Option A** is the mathematically correct improper fraction ($4 \frac{19}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$). This is a high-level trap. Many advanced and proficient students will convert everything to improper fractions to solve the addition, find the correct value, but then fail to "Leave your answer as a mixed number" as requested.
**Option C** represents a failed attempt at a common denominator (simply multiplying $10 \times 4$ but likely getting lost in the numerator calculation).

The presence of Option A makes this a "follow the instructions" test as much as a calculation test.

below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=20% D=45%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=10% B=88% C=1% D=1%
