This question tests the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). The primary difficulty lies in the contrast between the left side, where division must be performed before addition, and the right side, where the brackets force addition to happen first.

For "below_basic" students, the most common error is reading from left to right on both sides ($8+12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$), leading them to believe the expressions are equal. "Basic" students often remember brackets come first (making the right side 5) but fail to apply BIDMAS to the left side ($8+12 \div 4$ also becoming $20 \div 4$), again leading to option C. "Proficient" students typically recognize the left side requires division first ($12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8+3=11$), though a small margin may miscalculate or confuse the "greater than" and "less than" symbols. "Advanced" students will find this straightforward.

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=10% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=12% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
