As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as a test of two specific skills: directed number multiplication and the ability to distinguish between "multiplying" and "collecting" terms within the context of expansion.

The numbers chosen (-1 and -4) are low, which usually helps students, but the "minus times a minus" rule is one of the most persistent hurdles for students at the basic and below-basic levels. A common error here is the "addition" trap, where students see the signs and perform $-1 - 4 = -5$ or $-1 + (-4) = -5$, despite the question explicitly asking what Molly gets when she **multiplies**.

Here is my prediction for the performance distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=10% D=45%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=2% D=13%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%

**Reasoning:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many students in this category struggle to distinguish between operations. Seeing "minus 1" and "minus 4" often triggers an addition response, leading them to D (-5). They are also prone to forgetting the "two negatives make a positive" rule, leading to B (-4).
*   **Basic:** These students usually know they should multiply ($1 \times 4 = 4$), but they often get the sign wrong. The choice between A and B is where the struggle lies, though a significant portion will still fall into the addition trap (D).
*   **Proficient:** These students are comfortably working at a GCSE Grade 4/5 level. They understand that FOIL/Grid method involves multiplication and they generally remember the sign rules, though some might make a "careless" slip under pressure and choose D.
*   **Advanced:** For high-achieving students, this is a trivial component of a larger problem. Errors here would be extremely rare.
