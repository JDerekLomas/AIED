As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've analyzed this specific question. The equation is presented in an implicit form ($ax + by = c$) rather than the explicit form ($y = mx + c$) that lower-ability students are more comfortable with. 

The primary "trap" here is how students handle the $4x$ term when $x=0$.
*   **The correct path:** If $x=0$, then $4(0) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 10 \rightarrow y = 5$.
*   **Distractor A (20):** Students multiply 4 by 5 (the result of the constant) or misapply the multiplier to the constant.
*   **Distractor B (3):** Students see "4" and "2" and "10" and somehow subtract 4 from 10 and then divide incorrectly, or guess a mid-range value.
*   **Distractor D (2.5):** A very common error where students divide 10 by 4 instead of 10 by 2, or mix up the coefficients of $x$ and $y$.

However, because $x=0$, the "elimination" of the $4x$ term makes this significantly easier than if $x$ were 1 or 2. Most students at "Proficient" and "Advanced" levels will see that $2y = 10$ immediately. "Below Basic" students often struggle with the substitution step entirely and may choose C by luck or A by performing a random multiplication of the visible numbers.

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=50% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
