This question specifically tests two potential pitfalls: the confusion between multiplication and exponentiation (resulting in 12 or -12) and the sign rule for negative bases with even exponents (resulting in -81).

While the misconception $k \times 4$ (leading to 12) is common at lower ability levels, the most "dangerous" distractor for the middle-to-high ability cohort is -81. Many students are taught that "a negative times a negative is a positive," but when they see $-3^4$ on a calculator or written without brackets, they frequently conclude the result is negative. However, at the "Advanced" level, students are well-drilled in the fact that any real number raised to an even power must be positive.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%
