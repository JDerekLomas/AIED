This question is a classic test of "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS), but it specifically targets a very common and persistent misconception regarding the relationship between Addition and Subtraction.

In **Problem Q**, most students understand that multiplication comes before addition. However, in **Problem P**, many students believe that because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym BIDMAS, they must calculate $5+6$ first. This leads them to the incorrect answer of $4-11=-7$, rather than the correct left-to-right calculation $4-5=-1+6=5$.

**Why this specific question is difficult:**
1.  **Acronym Trap:** The "Addition before Subtraction" myth is one of the most ingrained errors in UK secondary schools.
2.  **Visual Distraction:** In Problem P, the $+6$ looks "easier" to attach to the $5$ for students who struggle with directed numbers.
3.  **Contrast:** Problem Q acts as a "buffer" that most students will get right ($5 \times 6$), making them feel confident while they simultaneously fall for the trap in Problem P.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=20% D=50%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=15% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=3% D=5%

**Analysis of the tiers:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often follow the acronym rigidly or choose based on what "looks" like a grouping. Many will choose **D** because they have been told "Addition before Subtraction" and "Multiplication before Addition."
*   **Basic:** This group is split. Some have learned the priority of multiplication (avoiding A and C) but still fall for the addition-before-subtraction trap in Problem P, leading them to **D**.
*   **Proficient:** These students have usually been corrected on the "Left to Right" rule for Addition/Subtraction and will identify **B** as the correct path.
*   **Advanced:** Almost all will recognise that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and must be done left-to-right, though a tiny margin may overthink the question or make a clerical error.
