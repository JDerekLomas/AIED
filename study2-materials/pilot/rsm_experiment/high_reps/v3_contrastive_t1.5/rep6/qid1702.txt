To solve this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into $10x - 6y = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, and $x = 3.3$.

**Analysis of Difficulty:**
*   **The Decimal Trap:** Many students struggle when $y$ is a decimal. Those who perform the inverse operation incorrectly ($10x + 3 = 30$) will arrive at $10x = 27$, leading to **D (2.7)**. This is the most common procedural error.
*   **Sign Errors:** Students who struggle with directed numbers might end up with $10x = 30 - 3$ or $10x = -33$, leading to options like **B**.
*   **Equation Rearrangement:** Below-basic students often swap the roles of $x$ and $y$. If they substitute $x=0.5$ into the equation to find $y$, they get $5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y \approx -4.16$ (Option A/B proximity).
*   **Strength of Distractors:** Option C (3.3) is very accessible for those who can handle the basic substitution, but the negative sign in the equation ($10x - 6y$) is a classic "trip-up" point for basic and below-basic learners who often add when they should subtract or vice versa.
