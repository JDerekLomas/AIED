This question tests a student's understanding of the order of operations when rearranging equations. Specifically, it addresses whether a multiplier applies to every term in an equation or just the fraction itself.

Tom’s method is the standard approach: adding 5 to both sides. This is intuitive and most students recognize this step first. 
Katie’s method is the common pitfall. To "multiply by 3" correctly, she would need to multiply *every* term on the left side, leading to $x - 15 = 36$. Many students, however, have a persistent misconception that you only multiply the fraction and the right-hand side, ignoring the constant term. 

**Below Basic** students often guess or follow the logic that because Katie's number 36 "comes from 12 times 3," she must be right, often choosing C because they think "both ways of starting" are usually valid in these types of questions.
**Basic** students usually identify Tom's step as correct but are highly susceptible to Katie’s error, often seeing $x-5=36$ as a valid shortcut.
**Proficient** students are starting to become wary of this trap; they usually get Tom right, but about 30-40% will still fall for Katie’s "partial multiplication" error.
**Advanced** students have usually been explicitly warned about "multiplying everything" and will correctly identify that Katie failed to multiply the -5.

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=28% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%
