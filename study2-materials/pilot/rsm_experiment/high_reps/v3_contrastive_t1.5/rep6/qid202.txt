This question is significantly more straightforward than many fraction addition problems because the denominators are the same and the sum of the fractional parts ($\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$) does not require regrouping/carrying into the whole numbers.

The main traps here are **Option D** (the classic misconception of adding the denominators) and **Option B** (the correct value but in the wrong format, as the question specifically requests a mixed number). For **below_basic** students, Option C is a common "wild guess" where they add everything in sight (2+1, 1+2, 5+5) but fail to keep the whole number separate. **Advanced** students will almost all get this right, with a tiny margin of error for those who provide the improper fraction (B) despite the instruction.

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
