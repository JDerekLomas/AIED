This question is a significant "trap" for students across all but the highest ability levels. It tests two distinct areas where students are notoriously weak: the priority of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the multiplication of decimals.

The most common error in this specific problem is to perform $(3 \times 0.3)^2$ instead of $3 \times (0.3)^2$. This leads to $0.9^2 = 0.81$ (Option A). Even students who correctly identify that they must square $0.3$ first often struggle with the decimal placement, calculating $0.3^2$ as $0.9$ (leading to $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$, Option D) or correctly calculating $0.09$ but then faltering on the final multiplication. 

Option B ($0.27$) is the correct answer ($3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$). Option C ($1.8$) is a distractor for students who confuse squaring with doubling ($3 \times 0.6$).

In a UK classroom setting, the distribution usually looks like this:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=30% B=45% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=10% B=85% C=2% D=3%
