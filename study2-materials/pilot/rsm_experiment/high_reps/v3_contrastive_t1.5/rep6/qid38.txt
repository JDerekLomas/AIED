As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this algebraic fractions question by looking at the specific interactions of the denominators $2x$ and $x$. 

The core challenge here is whether a student recognises that they only need to multiply the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$ to achieve a common denominator. Students at lower ability levels often default to the "cross-multiplication" method ($3 \times x + 4 \times 2x$ over $2x^2$), which leads to $\frac{11x}{2x^2}$. If they fail to simplify that result correctly, they are most likely to guess A or B. 

Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$) is the classic "add the tops, add the bottoms" error, which is the dominant misconception for students below the 'proficient' level. Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$) is a common mistake where students correctly identify the common denominator ($2x$) but forget to multiply the numerator of the second fraction.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=94% B=2% C=1% D=3%
