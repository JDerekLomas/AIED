This question specifically tests two key concepts: the property of **multiplicative inverses (reciprocals)** and the **rules for multiplying negative numbers**.

The difficulty lies in the fact that a student must correctly apply two steps: flipping the fraction AND selecting the correct sign. The most common pitfall is the "sign error" (Option B). Many students remember that a number multiplied by its reciprocal is $1$, but they forget that to get a positive $1$ from a negative starting point, the multiplier must also be negative. However, because the target here is **$-1$**, the multiplier must actually be **positive**.

- **Below Basic** students often guess or choose numbers that "look like" the numbers in the question (Option C or D).
- **Basic** students often recognize the reciprocal property but get confused by the signs, often over-applying the "two negatives make a positive" rule and choosing B to try and get 1, or simply choosing A by fluke.
- **Proficient** students usually identify that they need the reciprocal but may pause on the sign. Option B is the "smart" distractor here.
- **Advanced** students will quickly verify that $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -\frac{12}{12} = -1$.

The specific target of $-1$ instead of $1$ makes this trickier than a standard reciprocal question.
