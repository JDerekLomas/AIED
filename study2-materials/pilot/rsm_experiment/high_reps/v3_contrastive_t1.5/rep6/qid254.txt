As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on two main stumbling blocks: the presence of the number **0** in a data set and the **order of operations (BIDMAS)** in horizontal notation.

The "0" triggers a very common misconception where students either ignore it in the sum (which is mathematically okay) but then incorrectly divide by the count of non-zero numbers (Option C). Option A is actually the correct calculation because adding 0 doesn't change the numerator, and there are indeed 5 terms. Option B is a classic "calculator trap"—without brackets, only the 7 is divided by 5.

**Analysis of Difficulty:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often believe 0 "doesn't count," leading them to C. They also struggle to see that $0+1+3+4+7$ is the same as $1+3+4+7$ in the numerator of A.
*   **Basic:** Many will spot that there are 5 numbers and choose A, but a significant portion will be lured by B because it "looks" like the sum divided by the count, forgetting BIDMAS rules.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually recognize that 0 must be included in the count (rejecting C) and identify the BIDMAS error in B.
*   **Advanced:** Almost all will recognise A as the only mathematically sound expression, though a tiny fraction might overthink the "missing 0" in the numerator of A and choose D.

Predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=40% D=5%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=2% C=1% D=1%
