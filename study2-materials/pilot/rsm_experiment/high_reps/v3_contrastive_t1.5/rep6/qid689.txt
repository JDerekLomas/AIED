This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. While it looks simple, it is notoriously difficult for students below the 'proficient' level.

The most common error is the **"multiplication bias"** or "intuitive order" error. Many students see the numbers 10 and 5 and immediately think $10 \div 5 = 2$ or $10 \times 5 = 50$. Option C ($p=2$) is the strongest distractor because it satisfies the visual pattern of dividing the large number by the small number. Option B is chosen by those who think "to get $p$ on its own, I must multiply by 10".

Option A is correct ($10p = 5$, so $p = 5/10$), but it requires a two-step rearrangement or the conceptual understanding that for the result to be larger than the numerator, the denominator must be a fraction/decimal less than 1.

**Breakdown of results:**

*   **Below Basic:** These students often perform a single operation on the visible numbers. $10 \div 5$ is more "natural" than $5 \div 10$. They will gravitate towards C or B.
*   **Basic:** They recognize it's a division but often follow the "big number $\div$ small number" rule of thumb, leading them directly to C. They may also guess D if they think a smaller number cannot be divided to result in a larger number.
*   **Proficient:** These students understand how to rearrange. They will multiply by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, though some will still slip at the final hurdle and say $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$.
*   **Advanced:** These students either rearrange fluently or intuitively recognize that $5$ divided by a half ($0.5$) doubles it to $10$.
