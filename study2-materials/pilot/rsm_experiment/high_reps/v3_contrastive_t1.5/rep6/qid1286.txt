This question tests the ability to rearrange a formula where the subject is squared or cubed, specifically the volume of a sphere formula: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
This is a high-demand algebraic manipulation task for UK GCSE students (typically Grade 6/7 level). 
*   **The common trap:** When multiplying by the reciprocal of $\frac{4}{3}\pi$, many students struggle with where the $\pi$ goes. Because $\pi$ is usually written "next to" the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$, students often incorrectly keep it in the numerator when they move the 3, leading to **Option A**.
*   **Algebraic Process:** Students must first multiply by 3 ($3V$), then divide by $4\pi$ ($\frac{3V}{4\pi}$), and finally cube root. 
*   **Distractors:** **Option B** is a common mistake for students who correctly identify that $\pi$ and 4 should be on the bottom but fail to correctly invert the $\frac{4}{3}$ fraction. **Option D** represents a fundamental lack of understanding of inverse operations, where the student tries to cube root the $V$ first but then performs a standard (and incorrect) linear manipulation on the coefficients.

Lower-ability students (Below Basic/Basic) often guess or pick the option that "looks" like the sphere formula but scrambled, whereas Proficient students sometimes make the "inverted fraction" error.
