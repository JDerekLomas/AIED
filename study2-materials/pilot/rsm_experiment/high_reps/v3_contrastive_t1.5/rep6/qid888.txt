This question tests the expansion of a quadratic expression with two negative constants. While the basic mechanics of FOIL (First, Outside, Inside, Last) are well-drilled in UK classrooms, the directed number arithmetic required for the middle term $(-5 + -7 = -12)$ and the constant term $(-5 \times -7 = +35)$ provides several opportunities for error.

Option D is the most common "trap" for students who correctly add the negative numbers for the middle term but fail the "double negative" multiplication for the final term. Option A is a common error for students who confuse the rules and find the difference between 5 and 7 instead of the sum. Option C is chosen by those who ignore the negative signs entirely.

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often struggle with directed numbers. They might guess based on the numbers 5 and 7, often ignoring the signs or selecting A because $7-5=2$.
*   **Basic:** Usually familiar with the "grid" or "FOIL" method but frequently make the sign error on the last term (multiplying two negatives to get a negative), leading them to D.
*   **Proficient:** Good grasp of the distributive law. Most will navigate the signs correctly, though a small margin will make a "careless" sign error under pressure.
*   **Advanced:** Highly unlikely to make a sign error on such a standard procedural question.
