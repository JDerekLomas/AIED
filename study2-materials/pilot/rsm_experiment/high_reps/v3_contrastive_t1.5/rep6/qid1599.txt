This question tests the transition from arithmetic notation ($\div$) to algebraic notation (the fraction bar). While it seems straightforward, the presence of the bracket $(h+4)$ creates a specific structural challenge for students who are used to simple one-variable divisions.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **A (Correct):** Shows the numerator and the bracketed expression as the denominator.
*   **B (Distributive Error):** A common mistake where students feel the need to "balance" or change the numerator based on the denominator.
*   **C (BODMAS/Order of Operations Error):** Students who think the division only applies to the first term ($h$) and then "add 4" separately. This is a very common error for mid-tier students.
*   **D (Inverse Error):** Students who confuse the dividend and divisor.

**Student Performance Predictions:**
The bracket acts as a helpful "container," which actually makes this question slightly easier than $c \div h + 4$ (which would be ambiguous without the bracket). However, students at lower ability levels often struggle with which letter goes on top of the fraction.
