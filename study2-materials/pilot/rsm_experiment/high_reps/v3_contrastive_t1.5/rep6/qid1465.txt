This question is a classic test of Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), but it contains a very specific trap that catches students even if they know they should multiply first.

The most common error for students who understand they must do $4 \times 2$ first is the subtraction step. Many students process $3 - 5 + 8$ as $3 - 13$ because they see the addition sign and incorrectly think "Addition comes before Subtraction" in the BIDMAS acronym (not realizing they carry equal weight). This leads to **Option D (-10)**.

Students at lower ability levels often ignore the order of operations entirely and work strictly left-to-right: $3-5 = -2$; then $-2+4 = 2$; then $2 \times 2 = 4$. This leads to **Option B (4)**.

**Option A (6)** is the correct answer: $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 8 = 6$.

**Option C (-12)** is a "double error" choice where a student calculates $3 - (5+4) \times 2$, which is less common but seen in students who over-apply parentheses mentally.
