This question tests the ability to rearrange the formula for the volume of a sphere: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

While the conceptual steps are standard, this specific question is more difficult than typical volume questions because it is purely algebraic. Students must correctly identify that to isolate $r$, they need to multiply by 3 and divide by $4\pi$. 

Common pitfalls include:
1. **Misarranging the fraction:** Students often multiply by the numerator and divide by the denominator of the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$, leading to option B.
2. **Incomplete root application:** Many students forget that the cube root must apply to the entire expression, not just the numerator.
3. **Confusion with $\pi$:** Some students instinctively put $\pi$ in the numerator alongside the $V$ because they are used to seeing $V$ and $\pi$ on the same "level" in the original formula.

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often guess or pick options where $\pi$ is in the numerator (A) or misinterpret how to treat the $V$ entirely.
*   **Basic:** Usually recall the sphere formula but struggle with the two-step rearrangement of a fraction involving $\pi$. Many will correctly see a cube root is needed but choose the wrong "orientation" of the fraction (B).
*   **Proficient:** Understand the steps $(3V)/(4\pi)$ and then applying the cube root. The main error here is algebraic slip-ups.
*   **Advanced:** High mastery of rearranging formulae. They will identify C almost immediately as the inverse operation.
