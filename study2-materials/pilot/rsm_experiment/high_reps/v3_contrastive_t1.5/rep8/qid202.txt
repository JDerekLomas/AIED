This is a straightforward addition of mixed numbers where the denominators are the same and the sum of the fractions does not result in an improper fraction. Therefore, the "bridging" error is not tested here.

The primary challenges in this specific question are:
1. **D**: The most common error in fraction addition—adding the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$).
2. **B**: Converting to an improper fraction. While mathematically equivalent, the question explicitly asks for a **mixed number**. Students who rush often select B because they've been taught to convert to improper fractions first and forget to convert back.
3. **C**: A combination of adding denominators and ignoring the whole numbers or performing incorrect multiplication/addition.

**Breakdown of performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will instinctively add the denominators (D) or simply choose an answer that looks like a combination of the numbers (C).
*   **Basic:** Most will correctly add the whole numbers and the numerators, but a significant portion will still fall for the "add the denominators" trap (D).
*   **Proficient:** High accuracy, but a few will lose marks by selecting the improper fraction (B) because they didn't read the instruction "as a mixed number" carefully.
*   **Advanced:** Almost universal accuracy, with only the rarest of slips.
