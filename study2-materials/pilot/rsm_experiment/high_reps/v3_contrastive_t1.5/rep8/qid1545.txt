This question specifically tests the understanding of **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)**. 

The common trap here is for students to work from left to right on both sides of the expression. 
*   **Left side:** $8 + 12 \div 4$. A student following BIDMAS does $12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8 + 3 = 11$. A student working left-to-right does $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.
*   **Right side:** $(8 + 12) \div 4$. Both the BIDMAS student and the left-to-right student will arrive at $20 \div 4 = 5$ because the brackets force the addition first.

Because the "incorrect" left-to-right method leads to $5 = 5$, many lower-ability students will choose **C**. Students who understand priority but make a calculation error might guess, but the primary distractor here is the lack of priority awareness. Option **A** is the correct answer ($11 > 5$).
