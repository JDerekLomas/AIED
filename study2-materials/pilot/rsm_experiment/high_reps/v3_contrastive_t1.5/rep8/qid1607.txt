In this equation, Isaac correctly handles the first step (multiplying by 4 to get 60) but makes a very common "sign error" or "inverse operation error" in Step 2. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$, he adds 1.

For **below basic** students, many struggle with the initial rearrangement (Step 1) and may think both steps look "mathsy" enough to be correct, or they might think Step 1 is wrong because they want to subtract 4 first. **Basic** students usually recognise Step 1 as a standard "multiply by the denominator" move, but they are the prime candidates for the "inverse trap" in Step 2—they see $+1$ and instinctively add it to the other side to get 61. **Proficient** students generally spot that $60-1=59$, and thus Step 2 is incorrect. **Advanced** students will solve the whole thing mentally in seconds and identify the error immediately.
