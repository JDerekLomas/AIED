This question targets a very specific and common misconception in multi-step algebraic equations: the order of inverse operations and the distributive property of multiplication across an equation.

**Analysis:**
*   **Tom's method** is standard: he adds 5 to both sides first. This is mathematically sound and the way most students are taught to solve two-step equations.
*   **Katie's method** represents a very common error. She has multiplied the terms $\frac{x}{3}$ and $12$ by 3, but failed to multiply the $-5$ by 3. For Katie's "next line" to be correct, it would need to be $x - 15 = 36$.
*   **Difficulty:** This is a high-discrimination question. Lower-ability students often see "multiplying by the denominator" as a magic action that only affects the fraction and the other side of the equals sign, forgetting the middle term. Students who are "proficient" might still fall for Katie's logic because it *looks* like a valid step they've seen before, whereas "advanced" students will recognize the violation of the distributive property.
