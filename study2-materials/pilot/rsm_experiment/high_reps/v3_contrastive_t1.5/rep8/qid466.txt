This question specifically tests the understanding of multiplicative inverses (reciprocals) in the context of directed numbers. The product is $-1$, which is a "danger zone" for students because it requires them to balance two distinct rules: the reciprocal rule (turning the fraction upside down) and the signs rule (negative $\times$ positive = negative).

The most common error in the UK classroom for this specific problem is Option B. Students often internalise that to get "1", they need the reciprocal ($4/3$), but they also have a strong "matching" instinct with signs, or they over-apply the rule that "negative and negative makes a positive" and mistakenly think they need another negative to reach the $-1$ (forgetting the target is negative, not positive).

Option C and D are less common but attract "Below Basic" students who are overwhelmed by fractions and simply pick one of the numbers already present in the question.

**Difficulty Analysis:**
*   **The Trap:** Many students correctly identify $4/3$ as the reciprocal but choose $-4/3$ (Option B) because they over-correct the sign or think they are looking for a "negative reciprocal" (confusing this with perpendicular gradients).
*   **Success Rate:** Proficient students usually navigate this well, but "Basic" students have a high tendency to pick B.
