As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've seen many students tackle the "FOIL" or grid method for expanding brackets. This specific question targets the multiplication of the constants (the 'Last' terms). 

The primary pitfalls here are the "double negative" ($-1 \times -4$) and the common confusion between multiplying and adding directed numbers. 
*   **A (+4)** is the correct product.
*   **B (-4)** catches students who know to multiply but forget that a negative times a negative is a positive.
*   **C (+5)** is rare, representing a weird mix of addition and sign flipping.
*   **D (-5)** is the classic "adding" error ($-1 + -4 = -5$), which is a very strong distractor for students who confuse the rules of operations when they see brackets.

In this specific case, the numbers are small (1 and 4), which makes the multiplication easy, but the negative signs are the "boss" of the question.

basic: A=50% B=25% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=12% C=3% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
