This question tests a student's ability to expand double brackets with two negative terms. The primary "traps" here are the arithmetic of directed numbers: summing $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$, and multiplying $-5$ by $-7$ to get $+35$.

Option **A** targets students who subtract the numbers rather than adding their absolute values ($-7 - (-5) = -2$).
Option **C** targets students who ignore the signs entirely, simply treating it as $(m+5)(m+7)$.
Option **D** is the most common mistake for "Basic" and "Proficient" students; they correctly identify that $-5 + -7 = -12$, but they fail the "double negative" rule, incorrectly assuming a negative times a negative stays negative.

**Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the distributive property itself or guess based on the numbers 5 and 7. They are very likely to choose C (making everything positive) or D.
**Basic:** These students understand the FOIL/Grid method but frequently make errors with the final constant term sign. D is a very "attractive" wrong answer here.
**Proficient:** Most should navigate the $-12m$ correctly, but a small percentage will still slip on the $-5 \times -7$ calculation due to cognitive load.
**Advanced:** High-level students will recognise this as a standard expansion and rarely make sign errors on such low coefficients.

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=45% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
