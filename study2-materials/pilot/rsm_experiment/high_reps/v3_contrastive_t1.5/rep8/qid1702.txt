To solve this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, and finally $x = 3.3$.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
This question tests two main areas: the ability to substitute into an implicit linear equation and basic algebraic manipulation.
*   **The Trap (Option C vs D):** The most common mistake is a sign error during manipulation ($10x + 3 = 30$ leading to $x = 2.7$). Many students see "$-6y$" and, when moving it to the other side, either forget to change the sign or miscalculate $30 - 3$ instead of $30 + 3$.
*   **The Trap (Option A):** This attracts students who mix up the $x$ and $y$ variables. If they substitute $x=0.5$ instead of $y=0.5$, they get $5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y \approx -4.16$ (rounding to 4.25 as a "best fit" guess).
*   **Difficulty:** This is moderately difficult for "Basic" students because the coefficient of $y$ is negative and the result involves a decimal.
