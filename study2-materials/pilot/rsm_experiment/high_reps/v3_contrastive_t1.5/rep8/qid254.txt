As a UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because it tests three distinct areas: the "zero" property in averages, the priority of operations (BIDMAS), and the formal notation of fractions as grouping symbols.

The most common trap here is Option B. Many students understand the *process* of "add them up and divide by how many there are," and they will see Option B as a literal translation of that sentence, ignoring the fact that without brackets, only the 7 is being divided by 5. Option C is the classic "ignore the zero" misconception, and Option A is the correct numerical calculation (as adding 0 doesn't change the sum, but it must be counted in the divisor).

Here is the predicted distribution:

**below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%**
Students at this level often treat the "0" as if it doesn't exist, leading them to Option C. Those who remember "add and divide" frequently fall for the linear look of Option B without considering BIDMAS.

**basic: A=35% B=35% C=20% D=10%**
At this level, students are more aware that the "0" must be included in the count of numbers, but they remain highly susceptible to the BIDMAS trap in Option B. They see Option A and recognize the calculation is correct, but they are often torn between A and B.

**proficient: A=65% B=15% C=10% D=10%**
Proficient students usually recognize that $0$ is part of the data set. They are also starting to be more wary of order of operations and will notice that Option B lacks brackets. Most will confidently select A as the only mathematically sound expression.

**advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%**
Advanced students will immediately see that $1+3+4+7$ is equivalent to $0+1+3+4+7$ and that the divisor must be 5. They will spot the BIDMAS error in B instantly. A small percentage might overthink and choose D if they are looking for the "0" to be explicitly written in the numerator.
