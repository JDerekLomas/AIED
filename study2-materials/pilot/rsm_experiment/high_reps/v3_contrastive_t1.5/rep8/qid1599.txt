This question tests a student's ability to translate division into fraction notation, specifically dealing with a binomial divisor. 

The main hurdle here is recognizing that the brackets in $c \div (h+4)$ signify that the entire expression $h+4$ must be the denominator. The most common errors in this context are:
1.  **C (Partial division):** Students who think only the letter immediately following the $\div$ sign goes on the bottom, often a result of misinterpreting BIDMAS or failing to see the vinculum (fraction bar) as a grouping symbol.
2.  **D (Reciprocal error):** Students who know it becomes a fraction but forget which term is the numerator and which is the denominator (a very common "basic" level error).
3.  **B (Addition carryover):** A less common error where students feel the $c$ needs an operation to "match" the bottom.

In this specific question, the brackets are clearly provided in the prompt, which significantly increases the success rate compared to a question where the student has to infer brackets (e.g., "Divide $c$ by the sum of $h$ and $4$").
