This question tests Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) with a secondary layer of directed number (negative arithmetic).

**Key factors in student performance:**
1.  **The Multiplication Trap:** Most students recognize that $4 \times 2$ comes first, giving $3 - 5 + 8$.
2.  **Left-to-Right vs. Addition First:** The most common error in the UK is the "Addition before Subtraction" misconception (the 'A' before 'S' in BIDMAS). This leads students to perform $(-5 + 8)$ correctly as $+3$ (resulting in $3+3=6$) OR incorrectly perform $5+8=13$ and then calculate $3-13 = -10$.
3.  **Linear Calculation:** "Below Basic" students often work strictly left-to-right: $3-5 = -2$, then $-2+4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$ (Option B).
4.  **Negative Number Errors:** Distractor C ($3-5 = -2$; $4 \times 2 = 8$; $-2 \times 8 = -16$ or similar confusion) is less likely than simply losing a sign.

Option A ($6$) is the correct answer ($3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = 6$). 

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=2% D=18%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
