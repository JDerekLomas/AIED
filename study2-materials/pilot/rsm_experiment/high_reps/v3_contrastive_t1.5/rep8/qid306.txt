This question addresses a very specific and common "Order of Operations" trap that is a hallmark of GCSE Foundation and Key Stage 3 assessments. 

In **Problem Q**, the mnemonic BODMAS/BIDMAS works perfectly: Multiply before Add. However, **Problem P** is the "Equal Priority" trap. Students are taught "Addition comes before Subtraction" in the acronym, but the rule is that they have equal priority and should be calculated left-to-right. 

Option D is the most attractive distractor for students who have "learned" BIDMAS as a rigid hierarchy rather than a grouping of priorities. Option B is the correct mathematical procedure ($4-5$ happens first because it is on the left).

**Analysis of student performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often simply work left-to-right regardless of operators, leading them to Option A.
*   **Basic/Proficient:** These students have learned BIDMAS but often take it literally (A before S). They correctly identify $5 \times 6$ must go first in Q, but incorrectly insist $5+6$ must go first in P. This makes **D** the most common wrong answer.
*   **Advanced:** These students understand the left-to-right rule for Addition/Subtraction and the priority of Multiplication.
