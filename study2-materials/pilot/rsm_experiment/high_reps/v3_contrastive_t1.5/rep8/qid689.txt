This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. While mathematically simple, it triggers two major psychological traps:

1.  **Linear Thinking (Multiplication):** Many students see the 10 and 5 and immediately multiply them to get 50, regardless of the operation.
2.  **Commutative Misconception:** Many students believe $10 = 5 \div p$ is solved the same way as $10 = p \div 5$. They perform $10 \times 5 = 50$.
3.  **Subtraction/Order Error:** Students who realize division is involved often do the "easy" division ($10 \div 5 = 2$) rather than the correct one ($5 \div 10 = 0.5$).

The fact that $p=2$ (Option C) is present is a major distractor because $10/5 = 2$, and students are conditioned to look for integer solutions. However, $p=0.5$ is often found by students who use trial and improvement or possess a stronger grasp of fractions.
