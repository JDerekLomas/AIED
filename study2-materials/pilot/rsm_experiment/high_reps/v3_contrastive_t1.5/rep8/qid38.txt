As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've analyzed this specific question on adding algebraic fractions. 

The core difficulty here is the common denominator. While one denominator ($2x$) is a multiple of the other ($x$), many students struggle with "imbalance." 

*   **Option A (Correct):** Students recognize they need a common denominator of $2x$, transforming $\frac{4}{x}$ into $\frac{8}{2x}$, then adding $3 + 8$.
*   **Option B:** This is the classic "add across" error ($3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$). This is the most popular distractor for lower-ability students.
*   **Option D:** This occurs when a student knows the denominator should be $2x$ but forgets to multiply the numerator of the second fraction by 2, simply adding $3+4$.
*   **Option C:** This happens if students try to make the denominator $x$ but fail to adjust the first fraction correctly.

The question is "mid-tier" difficulty because the denominators are not entirely different (like $x$ and $y$), which usually prompts a more structured method. The simplicity of $x$ and $2x$ actually invites "intuitive" errors like Option D.
