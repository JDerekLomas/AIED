This question tests the transition from arithmetic notation ($\div$) to algebraic notation (fraction bars). It also assesses the student's understanding of the order of operations when brackets are involved in a division.

The main difficulty here is not the concept of division as a fraction, but rather the structural placement of the elements. Option C is a common mistake for students who don't recognise the bracketed expression must stay together as a denominator. Option D is the classic "reciprocal error," where students forget that the first term in a division must be the numerator.

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the order of division and might be drawn to D because "longer expressions go on the bottom" or C because it looks more "algebraic."
*   **Basic:** Most students at this level understand that the line means divide. However, many will see the $+4$ as separate from the fraction, leading to a high percentage of C.
*   **Proficient:** These students recognise the brackets enforce the grouping, meaning $h+4$ must be the entire denominator. They are unlikely to flip the fraction or split the term.
*   **Advanced:** This should be trivial for advanced students, though a very small percentage might commit a "slip" (misreading the order).

below_basic: A=45% B=5% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=65% B=3% C=20% D=12%
proficient: A=88% B=2% C=6% D=4%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
