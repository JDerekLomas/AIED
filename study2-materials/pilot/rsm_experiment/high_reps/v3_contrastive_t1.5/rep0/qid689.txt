This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. While it looks simple, it is notoriously difficult for students below the 'proficient' level.

The most common error is the **"commutative trap"** or **"multiplication instinct."** Many students see the numbers 10 and 5 and immediately think of the relationship $5 \times 2 = 10$, leading them to choose **C ($p=2$)**. This occurs because they perform $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$, or they instinctively move the $p$ to the other side but fail to recognize it becomes a multiplier.

**Option A ($p=0.5$)** is the correct answer. Students at the proficient level will correctly rearrange to $10p = 5$, then $p = 5/10$. 

**Option B ($p=50$)** catches those who believe they should multiply the two visible numbers ($10 \times 5$), usually due to a half-remembered rule about "moving things across the equals sign."

**Option D** is a distractor for students who find the fraction $5/10$ confusing or "impossible" because the smaller number is on top.
