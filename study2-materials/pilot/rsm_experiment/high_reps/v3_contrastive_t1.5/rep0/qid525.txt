This question is a classic test of fraction addition, focusing on the common denominator and the ability to convert or maintain mixed numbers. 

The primary "trap" is option **D**, where students simply add the numerators ($7+1$) and denominators ($10+4$). This is the most common error among lower-ability students. Option **A** is the correct numerical value but in improper fraction form ($4 \frac{19}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$); since the question specifically asks for a mixed number, this becomes a test of reading comprehension as well as mathematical skill. Option **C** combines the error of adding the denominators ($10 \times 4$ or $10+4$ confusion) with improper fractions.

**Teacher's Insight:** Most proficient students will easily find the common denominator of 20. The real discriminator here is whether the student follows the instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number." High-performing students rarely miss this, but mid-range students often get excited when they see their improper fraction calculation ($99/20$) match option A and select it without checking the format.
