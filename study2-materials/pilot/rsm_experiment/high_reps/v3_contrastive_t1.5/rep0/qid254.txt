As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on two specific "traps": 
1. **The Role of Zero:** Students often ignore zero when calculating the mean, believing it "doesn't count" towards the divisor.
2. **Order of Operations (BIDMAS):** Option B is the "calculator error" representation ($0+1+3+4+ (7\div5)$).

Option A is mathematically correct as $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$, and the divisor 5 correctly includes the zero as a data point. However, many students will be put off by the absence of the "0" in the numerator of Option A, even though its absence changes nothing, or they will actively seek out the common mistake of dividing by 4 (Option C).

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=20% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=10% C=15% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%
