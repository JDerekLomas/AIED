As a UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because it tests **linear equations in implicit form** ($ax + by = c$) rather than the standard $y = mx + c$. 

The difficulty here lies in the "dual operation" required after substitution. Students must first substitute $x=0$, which simplifies $4x$ to $0$, and then solve $2y=10$.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **C (5):** The correct answer. Since $4(0) = 0$, the equation becomes $2y = 10$, so $y = 5$.
*   **A (20):** A common "blind operation" error. Students see 4, 2, and 10 and multiply 4 by 5 or mistake the relationship between the coefficients and the constant.
*   **B (3):** This often comes from students trying to "find the pattern" without calculating, or incorrectly subtracting ($10 - 4 = 6$, then $6 \div 2 = 3$).
*   **D (2.5):** This is a very common mistake where students divide 10 by 4 instead of 2, or mix up the roles of $x$ and $y$ coefficients.

**The "Zero" Factor:** Because $x=0$, this question is actually easier than if $x$ were 1 or 2, as the $4x$ term disappears completely. This means even lower-ability students have a high chance of success if they understand the basics of substitution.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=45% D=20%
basic: A=8% B=12% C=65% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=85% D=8%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=97% D=2%
