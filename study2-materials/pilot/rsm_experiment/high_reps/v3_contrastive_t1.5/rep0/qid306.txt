This question addresses two core concepts in order of operations: the priority of multiplication over addition, and the left-to-right convention for addition and subtraction.

Problem P is the "trap." Many students are taught the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS and see the 'A' (Addition) before the 'S' (Subtraction). This leads to the common misconception that they *must* add before they subtract, choosing $5+6$ first. In reality, addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be performed left-to-right.

Problem Q is a standard test of multiplication priority. Most students from "Basic" upwards are familiar with this, though "Below Basic" students still tend to calculate from left-to-right regardless of the operators.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A:** The "Left-to-Right" extremist (ignores BIDMAS priority in Q).
- **B:** **The Correct Answer** (recognises left-to-right for P, BIDMAS for Q).
- **C:** The "Acronym Follower" (incorrectly prioritises A over S in P, ignores priority in Q).
- **D:** The "BIDMAS Rigid" student (the most common error for high-ability students who over-rely on the acronym's letter order for P).

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=35% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=55% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=2% B=85% C=3% D=10%
