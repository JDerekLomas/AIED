This question is a classic test of "order of operations" in reverse when solving linear equations. 

**Tom's method** follows the standard "isolate the term" approach: adding 5 to both sides first. This is very intuitive and widely taught as the preferred first step, so most students across all levels will recognize Tom as being correct.

**Katie's method** tests a very common algebraic misconception. Students are taught they can "multiply through" by the denominator, but many forget that they must multiply *every* term in the equation, not just the fraction. Katie has failed to multiply the $-5$ by $3$. 

**The Trap:** Students at the **basic** level often struggle with the "order" of undoing operations. Because Katie did $12 \times 3 = 36$, it "looks" like math is happening, and many will assume there are simply two ways to start the problem. This leads to a high number of "Both" (Option C) answers. **Proficient** students are usually wary of Katie's move but a significant minority still fall for the visual cue of the multiplication. **Advanced** students will check Katie's work algebraically and see it is invalid.
