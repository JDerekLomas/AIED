This question tests two distinct concepts simultaneously: the multiplicative inverse (reciprocals) and the rules for multiplying negative numbers.

While many students know that a fraction multiplied by its reciprocal equals 1, the introduction of the negative sign creates a significant "sign error" trap. Students often focus so intently on "flipping" the fraction that they either forget to deal with the negative sign or incorrectly assume that two negatives stay negative. Option A is the most common distractor because students recognize the $4/3$ but fail to realize they need a positive result (+1), which requires two negatives.

**Below Basic:** These students struggle with fractions. They often guess C or D because they look similar to the numbers in the question, or A because they have a vague memory of "flipping" but no grasp of negative number rules.
**Basic:** These students usually know the reciprocal rule ($4/3$), but more than half will likely miss the sign. They see the negative in the question and choose A because they don't process that the target is $-1$, not $+1$.
**Proficient:** These students are generally reliable with negatives and fractions. However, under time pressure, a significant minority will still pick A as a "knee-jerk" reaction to seeing a negative fraction.
**Advanced:** These students will accurately check that $(-) \times (+) = (-)$ and will select A. Note: If the target had been $+1$, this would be a much easier question for them.
