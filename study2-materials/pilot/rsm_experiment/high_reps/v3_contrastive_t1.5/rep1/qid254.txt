As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on two specific "traps": the presence of the number 0 (which tests whether students count it as a value) and the correct use of BIDMAS/order of operations in horizontal notation (Option B).

**Analysis:**
1.  **The "Zero" Factor:** Option C is the classic distractor for students who think that because 0 doesn't add value to the sum, it shouldn't be counted in the divisor. 
2.  **The BIDMAS Trap:** Option B is a massive trap for those who know the steps but forget how calculators or formal logic handle division without brackets. Mathematically, $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$ equals $0+1+3+4+1.4 = 9.4$, not $3$.
3.  **The "Hidden" Correctness of A:** Option A is actually correct because $0+1+3+4+7$ is equivalent to $1+3+4+7$, and it is divided by 5 (the correct count of numbers).

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=45% D=10%
*Rationale: Students at this level will almost all ignore the 0 and pick C. Many will choose B because it "looks" like the buttons they would press on a calculator.*

basic: A=30% B=25% C=35% D=10%
*Rationale: Students start to realise the 0 counts towards the divisor, making C less attractive, but they still struggle to see that Option A is mathematically equivalent to including the 0 in the numerator.*

proficient: A=65% B=15% C=10% D=10%
*Rationale: Most proficient students will check if the sum works. They will spot that adding 0 doesn't change the numerator, and they will correctly identify that B is missing brackets.*

advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%
*Rationale: Advanced students will instantly see that $0+x=x$ and recognize Option A as the only mathematically sound expression.*
