This question targets a very specific and common misconception in multi-step linear equations: the order of operations when "undoing" fractions.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
Tom’s method (adding 5 to both sides first) is the standard and most common approach taught in UK schools. Almost all students who can solve equations will recognise this as correct.
Katie’s method involves multiplying by 3 first. This is a common "trap" area. To be mathematically sound, Katie would need to multiply *every* term by 3, resulting in $x - 15 = 36$. Many students incorrectly believe they only need to multiply the fraction and the right-hand side, neglecting the $-5$.

Students at "below basic" and "basic" levels often struggle with the "balance" method and frequently fall for Katie’s logic because they see the "divide by 3" and want to "multiply by 3" immediately without considering the separate term. However, Tom’s correct step is so intuitive ($12+5=17$) that Option A remains the most popular choice across the board, with Option C being the primary distractor for those with weak procedural fluency.

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=12% D=1%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
