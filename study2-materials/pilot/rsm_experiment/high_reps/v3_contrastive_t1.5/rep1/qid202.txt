This question tests the addition of mixed numbers with common denominators. It is considered a "low demand" question because it does not require finding a common denominator or regrouping (the sum of the fractions is less than one). However, the inclusion of the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number" is a crucial distractor for more able students who might automatically convert to improper fractions.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A (3 3/5):** The correct answer.
*   **B (18/5):** Mathematically equivalent, but fails the "mixed number" instruction. This catches "Proficient" students who are used to improper fractions being the standard in later KS3/GCSE work.
*   **C (18/10):** A common lower-ability error: adding the whole numbers ($2+1=3 \rightarrow 18$), adding the numerators, AND adding the denominators.
*   **D (3 3/10):** The classic "Add the tops, add the bottoms" misconception for the fraction part ($1/5 + 2/5 = 3/10$). This is the most common error for Basic/Below Basic students.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=40% B=5% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=65% B=5% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
