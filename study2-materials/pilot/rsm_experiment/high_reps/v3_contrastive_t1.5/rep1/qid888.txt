This question tests a student's ability to expand double brackets with two negative constants. This is a common area of difficulty because it involves three distinct steps where errors can occur: multiplying the variables ($m \times m$), combining the middle terms $(-5m - 7m)$, and multiplying the constants $(-5 \times -7)$.

The primary "traps" here are the signs. 
1. **The Middle Term:** Students often struggle with $-5 - 7$. Those who incorrectly think "two minuses make a plus" in an additive context will get $-2$ (Option A).
2. **The Constant Term:** Students must remember that a negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive. Those who forget this will choose Option D.
3. **General Sign Confusion:** Option C is for those who default to addition or assume everything becomes positive.

**Breakdown of performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the directed number arithmetic. They frequently pick D because they see two minus signs in the question and assume the answer must end in a minus.
*   **Basic:** These students usually know the FOIL/Grid method but make a slip on one of the signs. Option A is a very common "low-ability" mistake where they subtract the 5 from 7.
*   **Proficient:** These students generally handle the middle term (-12) well but occasionally slip up on the final multiplication (-5 * -7), though most will identify the +35 correctly.
*   **Advanced:** These students will find this a routine "retrieval" question and rarely make mistakes.
