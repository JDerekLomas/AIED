As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on common classroom observations regarding mixed number addition.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
1.  **The Common Trap (Option D):** This is the classic "add the numerators, add the denominators" error ($2+2=4, 7+1=8, 10+4=14$). This remains the most popular distractor for students working at 'below basic' and 'basic' levels.
2.  **Improper vs. Mixed Number (Option A):** This is the mathematically correct value ($\frac{99}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$), but the question specifically asks for a **mixed number**. Students at the 'proficient' level often perform the calculation correctly by converting to improper fractions first, then forget to convert back at the end.
3.  **The Denominator Error (Option C):** This represents a student who correctly identifies the need for an improper fraction but simply multiplies the denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) without adjusting the numerators correctly, or makes a multiplication slip.
4.  **Complexity:** The numbers 10 and 4 are relatively friendly. Students find the Lowest Common Multiple (20) easier than harder denominators like 7 or 9. However, the requirement to "Leave your answer as a mixed number" is the primary separator between proficient and advanced students.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=20% D=50%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
