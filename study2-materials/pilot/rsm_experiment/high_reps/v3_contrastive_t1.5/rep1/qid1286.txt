This question tests a student's ability to rearrange a formula involving a fraction, a power of 3, and the constant $\pi$. 

In the UK curriculum, rearranging the sphere volume formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) is a staple of Higher Tier GCSE. While the concept is straightforward, the algebraic manipulation often leads to predictable errors. 

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **Option C** is the correct answer.
*   **Option B** is a common mistake where the student multiplies by the numerator and divides by the denominator (inverting the fraction incorrectly).
*   **Option A** is a "blind" manipulation where students simply group all known terms together without considering their positions (multiplying by everything except $V$).
*   **Option D** represents a common "low-ability" algebraic error where the student applies the cube root only to $V$ and treats the rest of the formula as a coefficient to be moved at the end.

**Student Performance Factors:**
The main challenge here is the "three-step" rearrangement: multiplying by 3, dividing by $4\pi$, and then cube rooting. Students who are "below basic" often guess based on which symbols look "correctly grouped." Those at "basic" often stumble on the fractional inverse. "Proficient" students should get this right, though some will accidentally select B if they work too quickly. "Advanced" students will find this trivial.

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=15% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=96% D=1%
