This question is a classic test of "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS), but it specifically targets a very common high-level misconception regarding the hierarchy of addition and subtraction.

In **Problem Q**, most students from 'basic' level upwards understand that multiplication comes before addition. However, **Problem P** is the "trap." Many students are taught BIDMAS where 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction). This leads them to believe they must calculate $5+6$ first, whereas the rule is actually that addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be performed left-to-right. 

Therefore, **Option B** is the correct answer (Left-to-right for P, Multiplication first for Q). **Option D** is the most common "sophisticated error" made by students who know the acronym BIDMAS but do not understand the equal priority of addition and subtraction.

**Teacher's Insight:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students often work purely left-to-right for everything, leading them to Option A.
*   **Basic/Proficient:** These students have learned BIDMAS but often apply it literally. They will get Problem Q right but fall for the trap in Problem P, leading them to Option D.
*   **Advanced:** Only at this level do students consistently recognize that subtraction and addition are inverse operations performed left-to-right.

below_basic: A=50% B=15% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=5% D=45%
proficient: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
advanced: A=2% B=85% C=1% D=12%
