As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've analyzed this specific question. The difficulty here isn't the algebra itself, but the **format** of the equation ($4x + 2y = 10$). 

Most UK students are drilled in $y = mx + c$. When they see $4x + 2y = 10$, a significant portion of "below_basic" and "basic" students struggle to treat it as an equation to solve; they often try to perform a single operation on the 10 and the 4, or they mistakenly look for a pattern in a table they can't see yet.

**The Traps:**
*   **Option C (5):** The "Correct" path. $4(0) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 10 \rightarrow y = 5$.
*   **Option D (2.5):** A common error where students see $4x$ and $10$, ignore the $2y$, and divide $10/4$.
*   **Option B (3):** Students sometimes subtract 4 from 10 and then divide by 2, or make a mental arithmetic slip thinking $4+2+x+y=10$.
*   **Option A (20):** Multiplying $4 \times 5$ or some other irrelevant operation.

The fact that $x=0$ actually makes this question easier than if $x$ were 1 or 2, as it eliminates the $4x$ term entirely. This "saves" many proficient students who might otherwise struggle with rearranging.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=45% D=25%
basic: A=5% B=15% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=85% D=8%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=98% D=1%
