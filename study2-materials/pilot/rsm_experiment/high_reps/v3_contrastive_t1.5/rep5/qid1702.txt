To solve this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$.
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$

**Analysis:**
This question tests two main things: the ability to substitute into an implicit linear equation and basic decimal arithmetic. 
- **The Correct Path:** $10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$ (Option C).
- **Misconception 1 (Subtraction Error):** Students who subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it will get $10x = 27$, leading to $x = 2.7$ (Option D). This is the most common mistake.
- **Misconception 2 (Confusion of Variables):** Students who accidentally substitute $0.5$ for $x$ instead of $y$ get $5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y \approx -4.16$, which might lead them to guess B or A due to similar digits. 
- **Calculation Error:** Students often struggle with $6 \times 0.5$. If they treat it as $6.5$ or simply use the numbers poorly, they may end up with $x = 4.25$ (Option A).

The presence of $0.5$ makes the multiplication easy, but the negative sign in $-6y$ is a classic "sign-flip" trap that catches even mid-range students.
