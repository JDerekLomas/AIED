This question tests Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and directed number arithmetic. 

The primary "trap" is the common misconception that Addition must come before Subtraction (due to the letter 'A' coming before 'S' in the acronym), leading students to calculate $5+8$ or $5+4$ incorrectly. 

*   **Correct path:** $3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = 6$ (Option A).
*   **The "Addition first" trap:** $3 - (5+8) = -10$ (Option D). This is the most common error for mid-ability students.
*   **Left-to-right trap (ignoring multiplication):** $(3 - 5 + 4) \times 2 = 4$ (Option B).
*   **Sign error/Addition first:** $3 - 9 = -6$ (not an option) or $3 - (5+4) \times 2 = -15$.
*   **Incorrect grouping:** $3 - 5 = -2$, $-2 + 4 = 2$, $2 \times 2 = 4$ (Option B).

The presence of the negative result in the first step (3 - 5) is a significant hurdle for lower-ability students, often driving them toward Option B where they might ignore the signs to find a "cleaner" number.
