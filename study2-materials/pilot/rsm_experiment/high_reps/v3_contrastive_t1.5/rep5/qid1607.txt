In this question, Isaac correctly performs the first operation (multiplying by 4 to get 60), but then makes a classic "inverse operation" error in Step 2. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$, he adds 1 to 60.

This is a very common trap for students who have a procedural but fragile understanding of solving equations. They know they need to "do something with the 1 and the 60," and often instinctively perform the operation that feels more natural or simplifies the numbers in an additive way. 

For **Below Basic** students, many will see that $60+1=61$ and assume the math is correct without checking the underlying algebraic principles. **Basic** students often recognize Step 1 is correct but fail to spot the sign error in Step 2. **Proficient** students usually catch the Step 2 error but a small percentage might rush and see $60, 1, 61$ as a valid family of numbers. **Advanced** students will solve the equation mentally first ($k=59$) and immediately see Step 2 is incorrect.
