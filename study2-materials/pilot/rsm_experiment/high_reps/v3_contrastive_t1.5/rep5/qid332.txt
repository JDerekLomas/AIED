This question is a classic test of "order of operations" in reverse when solving linear equations. 

Tom's approach is the standard method taught in UK schools: "undo" the subtraction first by adding 5 to both sides. Most students find this intuitive.

Katie’s approach represents a very common and persistent misconception. To multiply by 3 as the first step, she must multiply *every* term by 3. By only multiplying the $\frac{x}{3}$ and the $12$, she has failed to multiply the $-5$. Many students at the "Basic" and "Proficient" levels mistakenly believe you can "move" a denominator to the other side of the equals sign regardless of other terms present. Because $12 \times 3 = 36$ looks like a "clean" mathematical move, it is highly attractive to those who don't fully grasp the property of equality (doing the same to *everything* on both sides).

Advanced students will recognise that Katie has missed the $-5$, while Basic students will often see both lines of working as "legal" because they have seen similar steps in different contexts.
