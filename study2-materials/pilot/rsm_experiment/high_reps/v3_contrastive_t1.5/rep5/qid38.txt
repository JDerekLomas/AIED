To predict the performance of students on this question, we must look at how they handle the common denominator and the addition of the numerators.

The correct method is to find a common denominator (typically $2x$). This requires multiplying the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$, resulting in $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$ (**Option A**).

**Common Misconceptions:**
*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** Adding the numerators ($3+4$) and adding the denominators ($2x+x$). This is the most common error for "below basic" students who treat fractions like integers.
*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** Realising that $2x$ is the denominator but forgetting to adjust the numerator of the second fraction (just doing $3+4$). This is a very common "working-memory" error for "basic" students.
*   **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** Getting the numerator right ($3+8$) but somehow losing the coefficient in the denominator, though this is less likely than the others.

**Analysis of Difficulty:**
This is a "medium" difficulty algebraic fraction question. Because one denominator is a multiple of the other, many students will find it easier than if the denominators were, for example, $2x$ and $3x$. However, the trap of forgetting to double the 4 is very strong.

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=5% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=2% D=13%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
