This question specifically tests the understanding of multiplicative inverses (reciprocals) in the context of directed numbers.

The "trap" here is the sign. Many students at lower ability levels understand that they need to "flip" the fraction to get a magnitude of 1, but they incorrectly apply the "two negatives make a positive" rule to the reciprocal itself, or they confuse the rule for reciprocals with the rule for perpendicular gradients (where you change the sign). 

Because the target is $-1$, and the starting value is already negative, the multiplier must be positive. This subtle distinction between the additive inverse (change sign) and the multiplicative inverse (flip fraction) is where most errors will occur.
