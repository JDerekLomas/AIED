This question is a classic "traps and conventions" problem. It tests three distinct areas:
1. **The role of zero:** Many students believe zero "doesn't count" and should be excluded from the divisor (Option C).
2. **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS):** Option B is mathematically incorrect because, without brackets, only the 7 is divided by 5.
3. **Implicit vs. Explicit Addition:** Option A is actually correct because $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$ is the same as $1 + 3 + 4 + 7$.

The difficulty lies in students overthinking the "presence" of the zero. Lower-ability students often pick C because they count non-zero digits. Mid-ability students often fall for B because it "looks" like the steps they type into a non-fraction calculator (often forgetting that their calculator follows BIDMAS). High-ability students recognise that while A looks slightly unusual, it is the only mathematically sound expression.

**Ability Level Predictions:**

**below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=50% D=5%**
*At this level, students almost universally ignore the zero when counting how many numbers there are. They also lack the BIDMAS awareness to see why B is wrong.*

**basic: A=25% B=35% C=30% D=10%**
*These students are torn. Many will pick B because it reflects the "add them up then divide" mantra, unaware of the syntax error. The "divide by 4" (C) remains a very strong distractor.*

**proficient: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%**
*Most proficient students recognise that zero must be counted in the divisor (eliminating C). However, a significant minority will still pick B, failing to spot the missing brackets.*

**advanced: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%**
*Advanced students will immediately see that $1+3+4+7$ is identical to $0+1+3+4+7$ and will spot the BIDMAS trap in option B.*
