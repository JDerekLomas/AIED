This question tests the conversion from linear division notation to the algebraic fraction convention, specifically focusing on the treatment of expressions in brackets (terms acting as a single denominator).

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **A (Correct):** Shows the entire bracketed expression as the denominator.
*   **B (Miscopying/Symmetry):** Students often "balance" algebraic fractions by adding components to the numerator that exist in the denominator.
*   **C (BODMAS/Brackets error):** A very common mistake where students forget the brackets and apply the division only to the first term, or simply transcribe the terms linearly without realizing the fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol.
*   **D (Reciprocal error):** A classic confusion about which term is the "divisor" and which is the "dividend."

In my experience, lower-ability students struggle with the visual structure of algebraic fractions. While "C" is a logical trap based on BIDMAS, many "Basic" students actually struggle more with "D" (ordering) because they are used to the "bigger looking" part being on the bottom or simply get the two positions reversed. Advanced students will find this trivial as it is a fundamental rule of algebraic notation.

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=3% C=8% D=4%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
