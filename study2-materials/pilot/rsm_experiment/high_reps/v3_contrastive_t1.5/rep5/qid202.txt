This is a relatively straightforward addition of mixed numbers because the denominators are the same and the sum of the fractional parts does not exceed a whole. However, the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number" is a crucial discriminator.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A (Correct):** The simplest path (adding wholes, then adding numerators).
*   **B (Improper Fraction):** This is numerically correct but violates the instruction to provide a mixed number. Stronger students usually spot this, but "Proficient" students who convert everything to improper fractions first often forget to convert back.
*   **C (The "Add Everything" Trap):** Adding numerators and adding denominators ($2+1=3$, $1+2=3$, $5+5=10$, leading to $3 \frac{3}{10}$) is the classic fraction misconception.
*   **D (Denominator Addition):** Similar to C, where the student adds the wholes correctly but adds the denominators.

**Performance Prediction:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will choose D or C because the intuition to "add all the numbers you see" is very strong at this level.
*   **Basic:** Students have learned to keep the denominator the same but often forget the "mixed number" instruction or make a calculation error, though A should be the most popular choice.
*   **Proficient:** These students rarely add denominators but frequently lose marks by not reading the final instruction, making B a significant distractor for those who prefer the "convert to improper first" method.
*   **Advanced:** Should find this trivial, but a tiny percentage may impulsively pick B if they aren't reading the formatting instruction.
