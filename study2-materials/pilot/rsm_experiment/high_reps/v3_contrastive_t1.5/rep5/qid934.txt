As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've analysed this question based on how students interact with linear equations in implicit forms ($ax + by = c$).

The key challenge here is that students are used to seeing $y = mx + c$. When presented with $4x + 2y = 10$, lower-ability students often struggle with the algebraic substitution when $x=0$, or they revert to "pattern matching" with the coefficients.

**The Distractors:**
*   **A (20):** Chosen by students who see $4x$ and $y$ and mistakenly multiply the constants $(4 \times 5)$ or confuse the $x$ and $y$ roles.
*   **B (3):** This is a "gradient-trap" distractor; students sometimes perform $10 - 4 - 2$ or make a simple arithmetic error.
*   **C (5):** The correct answer ($2y = 10 \implies y = 5$).
*   **D (2.5):** A very common error where students divide the wrong way ($10 \div 4$) or simply see the $4$ as the dominant multiplier.

**Difficulty Analysis:**
This specific question is relatively straightforward for "proficient" students because $x=0$ simplifies the equation significantly, eliminating the need to handle the $4x$ term. However, "below basic" students often get intimidated by the format $4x + 2y = 10$ and guess based on the numbers visible in the equation.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=65% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=3% C=90% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=98% D=1%
