This question is a classic test of two distinct areas: the order of operations/negative number index laws and the confusion between indices and multiplication.

For **lower-ability students**, the primary pitfall is interpreting $k^4$ as $k \times 4$, leading to answers of $12$ or $-12$. For **mid-to-high ability students**, the challenge lies in the negative sign. A common misconception (often reinforced by incorrect calculator input) is that $(-3)^4$ is $-81$. However, because the power is even, the result must be positive. This specific question is "harder" than $k^2$ because students are more likely to lose track of the signs during the repeated multiplication of four terms.

**Below Basic:** These students struggle with the definition of an index. Many will see "3 and 4" and perform multiplication.
**Basic:** Students here know indices mean repeated multiplication but often struggle with the sign rules for negative bases or revert to multiplication under pressure.
**Proficient:** These students correctly identify that $3^4 = 81$ but approximately half will succumb to the common "negative stays negative" misconception.
**Advanced:** These students know that an even power turns a negative base positive and are unlikely to be caught out by the calculation.
