This question addresses a very specific and common nuance in the UK curriculum regarding BIDMAS/BODMAS. 

**Problem P ($4-5+6$)** is the primary "trap." Many students are taught "Addition before Subtraction" because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym. They fail to realise that addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be performed left-to-right. Therefore, the correct first step is $4-5$, but a significant number of students—even those who are generally "proficient"—will mistakenly choose $5+6$.

**Problem Q ($4+5 \times 6$)** is a standard application of order of operations. Most students from "basic" level upwards know that multiplication comes before addition.

**Distribution Analysis:**
*   **Option B** is the mathematically correct answer (Left-to-right for P, Multiplication first for Q).
*   **Option D** is the most common "sophisticated" error, where students apply the BIDMAS acronym literally (A before S).
*   **Option A** is the "beginner" error, where students simply read both left-to-right.
*   **Option C** is rare, combining the literal BIDMAS error with a left-to-right error.
