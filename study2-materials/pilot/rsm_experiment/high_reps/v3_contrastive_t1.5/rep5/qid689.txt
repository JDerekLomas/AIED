This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. Even though the numbers are small, it is surprisingly difficult for lower-ability students because the intuitive operation is to "do something with 10 and 5." Many will mistakenly apply the division in the order $10 \div 5$ because they are conditioned to divide the larger number by the smaller one, or they believe that to "undo" the fraction they should just multiply $10$ by $5$.

Option C ($p=2$) is the most powerful distractor because it satisfies the "big number divided by small number" impulse. Option B ($p=50$) is for those who think "to move the 5, I multiply." Option A is the correct answer ($5 \div 10 = 0.5$).
