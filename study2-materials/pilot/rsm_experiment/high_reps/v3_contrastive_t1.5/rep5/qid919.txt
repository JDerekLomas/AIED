This question is a significant "trap" for students across multiple ability levels because it combines two common areas of error: the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and squaring decimals.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **B (0.27):** The correct answer ($0.3^2 = 0.09$; $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$).
*   **A (0.81):** A common order of operations error. Students multiply $3 \times 0.3$ first to get $0.9$, then square it to get $0.81$.
*   **C (1.8):** A "doubling" error instead of squaring. Students calculate $3 \times (0.3 \times 2) = 1.8$.
*   **D (2.7):** A place value error. Students correctly square 3 to get 9 and multiply by 3 to get 27, but misplace the decimal point as if $0.3^2 = 0.9$ instead of $0.09$.

**Teacher's Insight:**
Even proficient students frequently struggle with squaring $0.3$. They instinctively want the answer to be $0.9$. This makes Option D a very high-frequency error for mid-to-high-ability students. Lower-ability students are almost certain to perform the multiplication before the index (Option A), as $3 \times 0.3$ is "friendly" maths.
