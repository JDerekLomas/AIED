This question tests a student's ability to rearrange a formula involving a cube root and fractions. While the formula for the volume of a sphere ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) is usually provided in formulae sheets (or memorized), the algebraic manipulation required to isolate $r$ is a common sticking point.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **C (Correct):** Students must multiply by 3, divide by $4\pi$, and then take the cube root.
*   **A:** A common error where the student multiplies by 4 and $\pi$ instead of dividing (incorrect inverse operations).
*   **B:** A "half-way" error where the student correctly divides by $\pi$ but fails to correctly invert the $\frac{4}{3}$ fraction.
*   **D:** This represents a significant algebraic misunderstanding, where the student tries to "root" the $V$ first or treats the coefficients as being outside the radical.

**Student Performance Expectations:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often guess based on which parts of the formula they recognise. They are highly likely to pick A or B because the $4\pi$ stays "together" or because they struggle with reciprocal multiplication.
*   **Basic:** Students at this level know the formula but often make one slip in the rearrangement—most commonly forgetting that both $4$ and $\pi$ must move to the denominator (Option B).
*   **Proficient:** These students generally handle the multi-step rearrangement well. Errors here are usually due to rushing and selecting B because it "looks" similar.
*   **Advanced:** These students should find this straightforward, as it is a standard literal equation manipulation.
