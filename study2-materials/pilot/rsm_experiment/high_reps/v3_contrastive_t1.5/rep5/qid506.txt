As an experienced teacher, I've seen this specific equation catch many students off guard, particularly due to the location of the fraction and the prime-heavy numbers (3 and 12).

The most common error here is the "multiplication by the coefficient" rather than division, or incorrectly simplifying $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$. 

**Option A ($1/4$)** is a very strong distractor for lower-ability students. They see 3 and 12 and immediately associate them with division $12 \div 3 = 4$, then keep the fractional form or assume the $3$ somehow moves under the $1$ to "simplify" it into $1/4$.
**Option B ($1/36$)** is the correct answer ($\frac{1}{12} \div 3$ or $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$).
**Option C (4)** is the "panic" answer for those who ignore the fraction structure entirely and treat it as $3p=12$.
**Option D ($1/9$)** is a common calculation error for students who attempt to "cross-multiply" incorrectly or mistake the 12 for a 3 squared or a 27/3 derivative.

The leap from "knowing how to solve $3x = 12$" to "$3x = 1/12$" is significant for students at the Basic/Below Basic levels.
