This quadratic expansion question targets two primary areas of difficulty: the addition of two negative directed numbers and the multiplication of two negative directed numbers.

**Analysis:**
1. **The "Sum" Trap (The Middle Term):** Students often confuse the rule for adding negatives ($-5 - 7 = -12$) with the rule for multiplying them. Some might incorrectly "find the difference" if they are weak with negative numbers, leading to $-2m$ (Option A).
2. **The "Product" Trap (The Constant Term):** The most common error in this specific question is the sign of the constant term. Many students remember that $5 \times 7 = 35$, but forget that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive. This makes Option D the most popular distractor for basic and lower-proficient students.
3. **The Sign Flip:** Option C is for students who simply ignore the negative signs within the brackets or believe that "two negatives make a positive" applies to every part of the expression.

**Predictions:**
