As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've analyzed this question based on the specific choices and common student behaviors in Key Stage 3 and GCSE foundation/higher tiers.

**The "Tricky" Factors:**
1.  **Format Request:** The question asks for a "mixed number". Option A is numerically correct ($\frac{99}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$) but is an improper fraction. This acts as a significant distractor for students who calculate by converting to improper fractions first and forget to convert back.
2.  **The "Add Across" Trap:** Option D represents the most common misconception (adding the numerators $7+1$ and denominators $10+4$).
3.  **Denominator Error:** Option C uses a common denominator of 40 (multiplying denominators) but then either fails to adjust numerators correctly or keeps it as an improper fraction.
4.  **The Whole Numbers:** Most students will correctly add $2+2=4$, which makes options B and D much more attractive than the improper fractions for those working intuitively.

**Predicting the Percentages:**

*   **Below Basic:** These students struggle with the concept of common denominators. They are highly likely to pick D (the "add across" method) or make an error that leads to C.
*   **Basic:** These students know they need a common denominator but often make arithmetic errors. Many will arrive at $\frac{99}{20}$ (Option A) and stop there, or successfully navigate to B but still be tempted by the simplicity of D if they are rushing.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually handle the common denominator (20) well. The main pitfall here is Option A; students often convert to $\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$ and select A without reading the "mixed number" instruction.
*   **Advanced:** These students will almost all reach $4 \frac{19}{20}$. A tiny percentage might misread "mixed number" or make a rare "silly" arithmetic slip.

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=25% D=45%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=20% B=72% C=3% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
