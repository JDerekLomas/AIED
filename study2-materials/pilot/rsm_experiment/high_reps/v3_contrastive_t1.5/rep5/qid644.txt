As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common classroom observations of the expansion of brackets, specifically the FOIL method or grid method.

This question specifically tests the **"Last"** part of expanding brackets: $(-1) \times (-4)$. The primary hurdles here are the multiplication of two negative numbers (leading to a positive result) and the common "additive" misconception where students add the numbers instead of multiplying them.

The numbers 1 and 4 are small, which makes the multiplication $1 \times 4$ easy for most, but the presence of the minus signs is the classic "trap" for lower-ability students. 

*   **Below Basic** students often revert to addition when they see two integers together, or they apply the "a negative and a negative make a negative" rule incorrectly. They are very likely to choose -5 or +5.
*   **Basic** students usually know they should multiply, but many still believe that a negative multiplied by a negative stays negative, leading them to choose B (-4).
*   **Proficient** students generally know the rules of directed numbers but may make a "silly" sign error under pressure.
*   **Advanced** students will see this as a trivial task.

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=35% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
