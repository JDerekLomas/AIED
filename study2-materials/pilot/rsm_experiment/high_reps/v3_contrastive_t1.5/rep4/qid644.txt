This question specifically tests the multiplication of two negative constants within a binomial expansion context. 

The primary pitfalls here are:
1. **The Sign Rule:** Many students at lower ability levels remember that $1 \times 4 = 4$, but struggle with "negative times a negative."
2. **Operation Confusion:** A very common error when expanding brackets is for students to "combine" the numbers (addition/subtraction) rather than multiplying them. This leads to $-1 - 4 = -5$ or $-1 + (-4) = -5$.
3. **Partial Sign Awareness:** Some students know they should multiply, but believe the "minus" sign stays because there are minuses in the brackets, leading to $-4$.

The visual arrows simplify the cognitive load by removing the need to decide which terms to multiply, focusing purely on the arithmetic of $(-1) \times (-4)$.
