This question tests the expansion of a quadratic with two negative constants. This is a common stumbling block for UK students due to the directed numbers (negatives) involved, rather than the algebraic process itself.

The primary traps are:
1.  **The product of two negatives:** Many lower-ability students forget that $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$, leading them to Option D.
2.  **The sum of two negatives:** Students often confuse $-5 - 7$ with calculations involving positive integers, or incorrectly apply the "two negatives make a positive" rule to the addition part, leading them to Option C.
3.  **Basic subtraction errors:** Option A is for students who simply find the difference between 7 and 5 rather than adding the coefficients.

**below_basic:** Students here often guess or follow a single rule inconsistently. Many will see the two minus signs and conclude the answer must have minus signs (D), or fail to handle the $-5m - 7m$ correctly.
**basic:** This group knows the FOIL/Grid method but often makes one sign error. The most common error is $(-5) \times (-7) = -35$.
**proficient:** These students generally handle the $-12m$ correctly, but a significant minority still slip up on the final $+35$ under exam pressure.
**advanced:** These students have mastered directed numbers and the distributive law; errors here would be very rare and likely due to extreme haste.
