In this question, Step 1 is correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$), but Step 2 is incorrect because Isaac added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting 1 (a very common "inverse operation" error).

The "below basic" students often see "1+k" and "60" and automatically add them together because they see a plus sign, or they might think Isaac's first step was wrong because they don't understand the multiplication needed to clear the fraction. "Basic" students are highly susceptible to the error in Step 2; they often feel the "balance" is maintained by performing the same operation seen in the expression ($+$) rather than its inverse ($-$). "Proficient" students will spot the sign error in Step 2 but usually perform Step 1 correctly. "Advanced" students will systematically check the steps and realize the solution should be $k=59$.

The difficulty here lies in the fact that Step 1 *looks* right to many, but the intuitive "add 1 to both sides" trap in Step 2 is very strong for middle-to-low ability students.
