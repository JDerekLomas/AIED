This question tests the translation of linear horizontal division notation into fractional algebraic notation, specifically looking at the treatment of bracketed expressions. 

**Analysis:**
- **The Core Task:** Recognising that the expression following the division sign is the entire denominator.
- **Option B (The "Ghost" C):** This is unlikely to be a popular choice as it adds a +4 that doesn't exist in the numerator, though a tiny fraction of weak students might see the +4 at the end and apply it to everything.
- **Option C (Order of Operations Error):** This is the most significant distractor. Students often treat fractions as having higher priority than the addition, effectively "ignoring" the brackets or assuming the division only applies to the first term ($h$).
- **Option D (The Swap):** A classic "numerator/denominator" confusion, where students remember it looks like a fraction but forget which variable goes on top.

**Teacher's Note:** This is generally considered a straightforward question for those familiar with algebraic conventions. The inclusion of the brackets in the question stem actually makes it easier; if the question were $c \div h + 4$, the answer would be C. The brackets in the stem act as a strong visual cue to keep $h+4$ together.
