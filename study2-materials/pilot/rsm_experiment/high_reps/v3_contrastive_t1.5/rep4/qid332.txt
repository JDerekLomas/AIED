This question is a classic test of "order of operations" in reverse when solving linear equations. 

Tom's approach is the standard one taught in UK classrooms: add 5 to both sides first. This is generally the most successful path for students.

Katie's approach is a common pitfall. To "multiply by 3" first, every term in the equation must be multiplied. Many students forget to multiply the -5 by 3, resulting in \(x-5=36\) instead of the correct \(x-15=36\). 

In my experience, **below_basic** students often guess or choose C because they assume "both" methods in these types of questions are valid. **Basic** students often recognize Tom is right but fail to see the error in Katie's logic because \(12 \times 3 = 36\) "looks" right. **Proficient** students usually spot the mistake in Katie's work (the missing multiplication of the -5), and **advanced** students almost never miss this.

One subtle factor: some students may correctly identify that Katie is wrong, but if they are insecure about Tom's basic addition, they might lean toward D. However, A is the overwhelming favorite for those who know the steps.

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=10% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=82% B=3% C=12% D=3%
advanced: A=97% B=1% C=1% D=1%
