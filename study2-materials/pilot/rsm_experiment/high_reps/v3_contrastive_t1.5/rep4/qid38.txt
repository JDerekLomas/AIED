As an experienced UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question on adding algebraic fractions as a classic test of whether students understand that a common denominator requires a common *value*, not just the presence of the same variable.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **The Trap (Option D):** This is the most common error. Students see the denominators $2x$ and $x$ and simply add the numerators ($3+4=7$) while keeping or picking the "more complex" denominator ($2x$). 
*   **The Conceptual Error (Option B):** This represents the "add the tops, add the bottoms" mistake ($3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$). This is very common among students at the "basic" level.
*   **The Miscalculation (Option C):** Students realise they need a common denominator of $2x$, but they multiply the $4$ by $2$ to get $8$, then add $3$ to get $11$, but then incorrectly simplify $\frac{11}{2x}$ to $\frac{11}{x}$ or simply forget to write the $2$ back down.
*   **The Correct Path (Option A):** To solve this, students must convert $\frac{4}{x}$ into $\frac{8}{2x}$. Then $\frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

Many students struggle with the fact that the denominators are so similar; they feel they shouldn't have to change much, leading to the high popularity of Option D.
