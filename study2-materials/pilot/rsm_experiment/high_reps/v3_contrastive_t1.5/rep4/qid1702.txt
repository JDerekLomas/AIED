To answer this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$ and solve for $x$.

The equation becomes $10x - 3 = 30$, leading to $10x = 33$, and finally $x = 3.3$.

**Analysis of the difficulty:**
*   **The substitution error:** Students often mistake the position of $x$ and $y$. If they substitute $x = 0.5$ into the equation ($5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y = -4.16...$), none of the answers match perfectly, but some may drift toward B.
*   **The calculation error (Sign):** A very common error in the UK GCSE foundation tier is to handle the $-6y$ incorrectly. If a student calculates $10x + 3 = 30$, they get $10x = 27$, leading to **Option D (2.7)**. This is a very "attractive" wrong answer for basic/proficient students.
*   **The "Half" confusion:** Some students see $0.5$ and the numbers $10$ and $6$, and simply try to combine them. $10 - 6 = 4$, then adding a bit for the $.5$ leads them toward **Option A (4.25)** via guesswork.
*   **The correct path (Option C):** This is straightforward for those comfortable with two-step linear equations. The division by 10 makes the final decimal conversion easy, which slightly increases the success rate for proficient students compared to other "solve for x" questions.
