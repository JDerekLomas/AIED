This question is a classic test of the "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and specifically targets a very common high-level misconception regarding the hierarchy of addition and subtraction.

In Problem P ($4-5+6$), many students incorrectly believe that because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in BIDMAS, they must add $5+6$ first. In reality, addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be performed left-to-right. In Problem Q ($4+5 \times 6$), students must recognise that multiplication takes precedence over addition.

**Why this specific question is tricky:**
1.  **The "A before S" trap:** Option D is a very strong "attractive distractor" for students who have memorised the BIDMAS acronym but do not understand that addition and subtraction are "on the same level."
2.  **Left-to-Right bias:** Basic students often default to calculating from left to right regardless of the operators (Option A).
3.  **The proficiency gap:** Proficient students often fall into the trap of D because they are "over-applying" the BIDMAS rules they just learned. Advanced students recognize the equal priority of $+$ and $-$ and correctly choose B.

below_basic: A=50% B=15% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=30% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
advanced: A=2% B=88% C=0% D=10%
