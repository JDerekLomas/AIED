As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on common Key Stage 3 and GCSE student behaviours.

This question tests three distinct skills: common denominators, adding mixed numbers, and reading the final instruction ("Leave your answer as a mixed number"). 

**Option D** represents the classic "add the tops, add the bottoms" error ($2+2=4, 7+1=8, 10+4=14$), which is the most common pitfall for lower-ability students. 
**Option A** is the correct numerical value ($\frac{99}{20}$) but expressed as an improper fraction, catching out students who do the work but fail to convert back or follow the specific instruction. 
**Option C** represents a failure to find a common denominator, instead multiplying the denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) and then just adding the numerators ($7+1=8$) or mis-calculating.
**Option B** is the correct answer ($2 \frac{14}{20} + 2 \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$).

Low-ability students gravitate towards D. Proficient students often calculate the correct value but may choose A if they work entirely in improper fractions and forget the mixed number requirement. Advanced students will follow the instruction perfectly.

basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
