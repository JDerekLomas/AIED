This question is a classic test of whether students understand that the number zero is a value that must be accounted for in the denominator when calculating a mean, and whether they understand the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) in horizontal notation.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
- **The "Zero" Trap:** Option C is the primary distractor. Many students intuitively ignore $0$ because it doesn't change the sum. However, if they ignore it in the sum, they often ignore it in the count, leading them to divide by 4.
- **The Notation Trap:** Option B is mathematically incorrect because of the order of operations ($7 \div 5$ happens first), but it "looks" like the sum-then-divide process.
- **The Identity Property:** Option A is actually **correct** because adding $0$ to the sum ($1+3+4+7$) does not change the numerator, and the denominator is correctly identified as $5$.

Many "Proficient" students will overthink this and select "None of them" because they expect to see $0$ explicitly written in the numerator, missing the fact that $0+1+3+4+7$ is identical to $1+3+4+7$. "Below Basic" students will almost universally choose C.

below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=60% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=45% B=5% C=30% D=20%
advanced: A=85% B=2% C=3% D=10%
