This question tests the ability to rearrange a formula involving a fraction, a power of 3, and the constant $\pi$. 

The core difficulty lies in the algebraic manipulation of $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. Students often struggle with the "order of operations" in reverse:
1.  **The Fraction Trap:** Many students aren't sure whether to multiply or divide by the $\frac{4}{3}$. This leads to choosing Option A (where they multiplied by 4 and $\pi$ instead of dividing).
2.  **The $\pi$ placement:** Less confident students often leave $\pi$ in the numerator or forget its relationship to the 4, leading to Option B.
3.  **The Cube Root Scope:** Option D represents a common error where students don't realize the entire expression must be under the radical, or they try to "simplify" the cube root incorrectly.

Option C is the correct rearrangement ($r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$).
