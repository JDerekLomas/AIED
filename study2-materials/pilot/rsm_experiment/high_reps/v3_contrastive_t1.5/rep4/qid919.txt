This question targets two primary areas of student difficulty: the priority of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and decimal multiplication.

The core struggle for lower-ability students is the "3 times $x$" part of the equation. Many students will naturally perform $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then square it to get $0.81$ (Option A), or simply multiply $0.3$ by $3$ and then by $2$ (thinking $x^2$ is $x \times 2$) to get $1.8$ (Option C).

The most common mistake for "basic" and "proficient" students is failing to correctly square $0.3$. A significant number of students believe $0.3^2 = 0.9$ because $3^2=9$. If they perform $3 \times 0.9$, they arrive at $2.7$ (Option D). While Option B is the correct answer ($3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$), the "logic" behind Option D feels very attractive to students who have a weak grasp of place value in decimal multiplication.

Advanced students will recognise that squaring $0.3$ yields $0.09$ and then triple it.
