As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common classroom observations and student performance data for linear equations.

**Teacher Analysis:**
The primary difficulty here is not the calculation, but the form of the equation. Most students are drilled in $y = mx + c$. When presented with an implicit form ($4x + 2y = 10$), many "below basic" students will ignore the $2y$ or the $4x$ entirely. 
*   **The Trap for C:** Students see $x=0$, ignore the $4x$, and mistakenly solve $2y=10$. This is the most likely correct-looking path for a student with partial knowledge.
*   **The Trap for D:** Students see the numbers 4 and 10 and perform a simple division $10 \div 4 = 2.5$, assuming the coefficient of $x$ is the key.
*   **The Trap for A:** Students add all the visible constants ($4+2+10=16$) or multiply ($4 \times 5$), often common with students who have very low algebraic fluency.
*   **The Star ($\bigstar$):** Students find $x=0$ the easiest substitution, so "Proficient" and "Advanced" students will almost universally get this right (result: $2y=10 \Rightarrow y=5$).

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=65% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=3% C=90% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=98% D=1%
