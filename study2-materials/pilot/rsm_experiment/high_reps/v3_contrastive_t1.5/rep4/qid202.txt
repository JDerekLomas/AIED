This question tests the addition of mixed numbers with common denominators. It is considered a relatively "safe" question because the fractional parts ($1/5$ and $2/5$) do not cross the whole-number boundary, meaning no regrouping (carrying) is required.

The main traps here are:
1.  **Option D:** Adding the denominators ($5+5=10$), which is the most common error in fraction addition across all lower ability levels.
2.  **Option B:** Converting to an improper fraction. While mathematically equivalent, the question explicitly asks for a mixed number. High-ability students will notice this instruction; lower-ability students might stop once they reach a correct value.
3.  **Option C:** Adding both the numerators and denominators (the "freshman's error").

**Teacher's Analysis:**
Most "Proficient" and "Advanced" students will find this trivial. The biggest differentiator is the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number." Advanced students will follow this instinctively. Below-basic students are highly likely to add the denominators, leading them to D.

below_basic: A=35% B=5% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
