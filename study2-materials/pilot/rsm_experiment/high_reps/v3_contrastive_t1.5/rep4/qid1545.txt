This question tests the understanding of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). 

**Teacher Analysis:**
The "left-hand side" ($8 + 12 \div 4$) is the classic trap. Students at the below_basic and basic levels almost instinctively read left-to-right, performing $8+12=20$ and then $20 \div 4 = 5$. This leads them to see $5$ on the left and $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$ on the right, making Option C (equality) a very high-frequency "distractor" for lower-ability students. 

The correct calculation is $8 + 3 = 11$. Since $11 > 5$, the answer is A. Proficiency depends entirely on whether the student has moved past the "reading like a sentence" stage of arithmetic. Advanced students will spot this immediately as a "standard" BIDMAS trick question.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=10% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
