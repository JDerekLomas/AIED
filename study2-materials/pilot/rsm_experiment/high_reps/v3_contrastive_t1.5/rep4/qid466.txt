This question is a classic test of two distinct mathematical concepts: the **multiplicative inverse (reciprocal)** and **sign rules**. 

While many students know that a number times its reciprocal equals 1, the presence of the negative sign in the result ($-1$) creates a significant trap. Many students will correctly identify that they need to flip the fraction to $\frac{4}{3}$, but they will fail to account for the sign of the product. Because the question result is negative, and the starting value is negative, the multiplier must be positive ($-\times+=-$). Option B is the strongest distractor because it "looks" like the starting value but flipped.

**Breakdown of student performance:**

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the concept of reciprocals and will look for "sameness." Many will pick C because it makes the numbers look balanced, or B because they've heard "negative and negative make positive" and misapply it here thinking they need to preserve the negative look.
*   **Basic:** These students usually recognize the reciprocal property ($\frac{3}{4}$ goes with $\frac{4}{3}$), but they frequently get confused by the sign rules. They are the most likely to pick B, thinking that because the start and end are negative, the middle must also be negative.
*   **Proficient:** These students handle the reciprocal well. They are much better at sign rules but a significant portion will still rush and pick B because they associate "negative result" with "everything must be negative."
*   **Advanced:** These students will pause, perform the sign check ($-\times ? = -$), and identify that the multiplier must be positive. They are highly unlikely to miss this, though a tiny margin might slip up through overconfidence.
