This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. It is significantly more difficult than $10 = p/5$ because students cannot simply use a one-step inverse operation of multiplication. 

The most common error for **Basic** and **Below Basic** students is to perform the operation they see ($10 \times 5$) resulting in $50$, or to divide the larger number by the smaller number regardless of position ($10 \div 5$) resulting in $2$. 

**Proficient** students understand that $p$ must be a number that divides into 5 to make 10, recognizing that $p$ must be less than 1. However, many still struggle with the formal algebraic steps (multiplying by $p$ then dividing by 10) and may revert to mental arithmetic which occasionally leads to the correct answer.

**Advanced** students see the relationship $10p = 5 \implies p = 0.5$ immediately.
