This question tests two distinct concepts: the property of **multiplicative inverses** (reciprocals) and the **multiplication of signed numbers**. 

The presence of the negative sign is the primary "trap." Students at the lower end often focus on one rule (e.g., "to get 1, flip the fraction") and forget the second rule ("negative times positive is negative"). While the goal is $-1$, many students will reflexively aim for $+1$ and choose $B$, or simply try to make the numbers "match" by choosing $C$ or $D$.

**Predicted Percentages:**

**below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%**
Students at this level often guess based on visual similarity. They may see the $3/4$ and choose $C$ or $D$ simply because they contain the same digits, or choose $A$ because they recognize "flipping" is involved but have no grasp of directed numbers.

**basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%**
These students likely know that $3/4 \times 4/3 = 1$. However, a significant portion will fall into the "double negative" trap. They know a negative is involved, so they might choose $B$ thinking they need another negative to make it "work," or they may choose $A$ correctly but for the wrong reason (randomly ignoring the signs).

**proficient: A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%**
Proficient students generally understand that $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -(\frac{3 \times 4}{4 \times 3}) = -1$. The main error here will be a "sign slip" where they overthink the negative and choose $B$, thinking $(-)\times(-) = (+)$ is the goal, failing to notice the target is $-1$, not $+1$.

**advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0% D=1%**
Advanced students will immediately recognise that to keep the product negative, the multiplier must be positive, and to get a magnitude of 1, they need the reciprocal. Only rare "silly mistakes" occur here.
