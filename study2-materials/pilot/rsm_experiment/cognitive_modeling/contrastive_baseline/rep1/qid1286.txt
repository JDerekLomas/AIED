This question tests a student's ability to rearrange a formula involving a cube root, a fraction, and the constant $\pi$. While many students know the formula for the volume of a sphere, the algebraic manipulation required to isolate $r$ provides several opportunities for error, particularly regarding the reciprocal of the fraction $4/3$.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **Option C (Correct):** Students must multiply by 3 and divide by $4\pi$.
*   **Option A:** A common error where students multiply by the entire coefficient ($4\pi/3$) instead of dividing by it.
*   **Option B:** This represents a partial rearrangement error where the student knows $\pi$ goes on the bottom but fails to correctly flip the fraction $4/3$.
*   **Option D:** This reflects a "surface level" rearrangement where the student keeps the coefficients in their original places but applies a cube root to the $V$, failing to account for how the coefficients move across the equals sign.

**Difficulty assessment:** For basic students, rearranging a formula with a fraction is a high-level skill. Proficient students usually manage the $3V$ and $4\pi$ but often struggle with the order of operations regarding the cube root. Advanced students will find this straightforward as it is a standard GCSE Higher tier "rearranging to find a variable" task.
