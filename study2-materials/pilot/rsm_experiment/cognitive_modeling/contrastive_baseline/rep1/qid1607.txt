In this question, Isaac performs the first step correctly (multiplying by 4 to get $60 = 1 + k$). However, in Step 2, he makes a common "inverse operation" error. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$, he adds 1 to 60, resulting in 61.

**Teacher's Insight:**
The structure of this question is a classic trap. Students who are "Below Basic" often struggle with the very first step (the fraction bar) and might pick D. However, the most common error is among "Basic" and "Proficient" students who see $60$, see $1$, and see $61$ and instinctively think the arithmetic is correct without checking the inverse operation (+1 becomes -1). "Advanced" students will quickly solve the equation themselves and identify that only Step 1 is valid.

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%
