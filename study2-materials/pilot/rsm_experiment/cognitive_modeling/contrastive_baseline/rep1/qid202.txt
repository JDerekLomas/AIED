This question is a relatively straightforward assessment of adding mixed numbers. Because the denominators are the same and the sum of the fractional parts ($\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$) does not require regrouping (converting to an improper fraction and back), it bypasses the most complex elements of fraction addition.

However, there are two main traps:
1. **The "Add Everything" Misconception (D):** Lower-ability students often add both the numerators and the denominators ($1+2=3$ and $5+5=10$), leading to $3 \frac{3}{10}$.
2. **Form of Answer (B):** While $\frac{18}{5}$ is mathematically equivalent, the instruction specifically asks for a "mixed number." Proficient students might convert to improper as a method and forget to convert back, but most will spot the mixed number option (A) and choose it immediately.
