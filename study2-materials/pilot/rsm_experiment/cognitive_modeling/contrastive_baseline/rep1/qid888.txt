This question tests the expansion of a quadratic expression with two negative constants. This is a notorious "sign trap" for UK students, particularly concerning the constant term ($-5 \times -7$) and the middle term ($-5m - 7m$).

**Key triggers for errors in this specific question:**
1. **The Double Negative Multiplication:** Many students remember that "two minuses make a plus" for the middle term addition but forget to apply it to the multiplication of the constants, or vice versa. Option D ($m^2 - 12m - 35$) is the most common distractor because students focus on the signs of $-5$ and $-7$ and feel the final result "should" stay negative.
2. **Middle Term Arithmetic:** Option A ($m^2 - 2m - 35$) targets students who find the *difference* between 5 and 7 instead of the sum, or who apply the rules of adding a positive and a negative number.
3. **The "Everything is Positive" Error:** Option C ($m^2 + 12m + 35$) is for students who simply ignore the negative signs entirely or believe that the $- \times -$ results in every sign becoming positive.

**Performance Prediction:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often guess or focus only on the numbers. They struggle with directed numbers. They are likely to pick D because the original problem has minus signs.
*   **Basic:** These students know they need $m^2$ and $12m$, but are inconsistent with sign rules. They often get $-12m$ right but fail on the $+35$.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually have a reliable method (FOIL or Grid). Their main error is a lapse in concentration regarding the constant term's sign.
*   **Advanced:** These students will identify this as a standard expansion and will be wary of the sign trap.
