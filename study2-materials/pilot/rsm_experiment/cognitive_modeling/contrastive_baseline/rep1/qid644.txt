As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've observed that this specific question highlights a classic hurdle in algebra: the "directed number" rule for multiplication versus addition. 

The primary trap here isn't the algebra itself, but the operation. Lower-ability students often default to addition ($1 + 4 = 5$) or struggle with the "double negative" sign rules. However, because the arrows explicitly point to a multiplication step within the FOIL/Grid method context, proficient students usually navigate the signs correctly. The most common error for the "Basic" group will be choosing $-4$ (forgetting that two negatives make a positive) or $+5$ (adding instead of multiplying).

Here is the predicted performance breakdown:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
