As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on common Key Stage 3 and GCSE student behaviours.

This question tests the addition of mixed numbers. There are two primary "traps" here:
1. **Option D (The "Add Across" Error):** This is the most common lower-level misconception where students add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and then simply add the numerators and denominators ($7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$).
2. **Option A (The Improper Fraction):** This is mathematically correct ($\frac{99}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$), but the question specifically asks for the answer as a **mixed number**. Proficient students often forget to perform the final conversion or fail to read the formatting instruction, even if their arithmetic is perfect.
3. **Option C:** A variation of the denominator error where students might multiply denominators ($10 \times 4$) but fail to adjust numerators correctly.

**Student Profile Analysis:**
*   **Below Basic:** Mostly succumb to adding the denominators (Option D).
*   **Basic:** Better understanding of common denominators, but prone to arithmetic slips or selecting the "add across" method because it looks easier.
*   **Proficient:** Will likely find the common denominator of 20 correctly. Their main error will be providing the answer as an improper fraction (Option A) despite the instruction, or a minor slip in converting $7/10$ to $14/20$.
*   **Advanced:** Usually read the "Leave your answer as a mixed number" instruction carefully and perform the fraction addition without issue.

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=20% D=50%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
