As a UK maths teacher, I identify this as a "one-step" equation that is deceptively difficult because of the fraction on the right-hand side. It tests the ability to divide a fraction by an integer, which is a common stumbling block even for students who "know" they need to divide by 3.

The most common error is choosing **A ($1/4$)** because students see the numbers 3 and 12 and perform a division ($12 \div 3$) while ignoring the fractional position. **C (4)** is the choice for students who completely ignore the fractional structure or multiply by 1/3 but invert it. **D ($1/9$)** is a less common error where students might try to "match" the 3 to the numerator or make a multiplication error.

**B ($1/36$)** is the correct answer ($\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{36}$), but many students will naturally gravitate towards the more "familiar" looking numbers found in A.
