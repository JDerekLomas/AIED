This question tests a student's ability to translate linear division into the algebraic fraction notation. While the concept is foundational, the presence of the brackets $(h+4)$ is a significant discriminator.

For **below basic** students, the primary challenge is recognizing that the fraction bar replaces the $\div$ symbol entirely. They often get confused by the position of variables (Option D) or try to "decompose" the expression by incorrectly applying parts of the bracket to the numerator (Option B).

**Basic** students generally understand that $c$ is the numerator. However, a common mistake is neglecting the impact of the brackets, leading them to choose Option C, assuming the division only applies to the $h$.

**Proficient** and **Advanced** students find this relatively straightforward, as the visual mapping of the "dividend" to the top and the entire "divisor" (the bracketed expression) to the bottom is a well-drilled skill at this level. Option D (the reciprocal) remains the most common "rushed" error for higher-ability students.

below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=3% C=5% D=7%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
