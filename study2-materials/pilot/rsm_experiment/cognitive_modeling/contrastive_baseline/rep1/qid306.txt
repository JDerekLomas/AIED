This question addresses two fundamental aspects of the order of operations: the hierarchical nature of multiplication over addition (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the left-to-right rule for operations of equal priority (addition and subtraction).

**Teacher Analysis:**
Problem Q is a standard test of BIDMAS, where most students recognize that multiplication comes first. However, Problem P is a notorious "trap" question. Because BIDMAS/BODMAS places "A" before "S", a significant number of students—even high-achieving ones—mistakenly believe they *must* perform addition before subtraction. They incorrectly calculate $5+6$ first, leading to an answer of $4-11=-7$, rather than working left-to-right ($4-5 = -1$, $-1+6 = 5$). 

While most students will get Problem Q right, the "Addition before Subtraction" misconception is remarkably persistent across all levels except for the most advanced students who have internalized that addition and subtraction are inverse operations with equal priority.
