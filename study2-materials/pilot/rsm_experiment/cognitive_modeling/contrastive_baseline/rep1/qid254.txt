As a UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because it tests two distinct conceptual hurdles: the significance of zero in a data set and the formal notation of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

The inclusion of the $0$ is the primary distractor. Many students have a deeply ingrained (but incorrect) rule that "zeros don't count." They correctly identify that they must divide by the count of numbers, but they struggle to decide if the "count" is 4 or 5. 

Option B is a classic "calculator error" trap. While mathematically the same result as the mean if typed into a non-scientific calculator sequentially, written as a formal expression it is incorrect because BIDMAS dictates that only the $7$ is divided by $5$. 

**Breakdown of choices:**
*   **A (Correct):** Students realise $0$ adds nothing to the sum but must be counted in the divisor.
*   **B (Notation Error):** Students who know the method but don't understand formal mathematical syntax.
*   **C (The "Zero Doesn't Count" Misconception):** The most common error for lower-ability students.
*   **D (The Over-thinker):** Students who think the $0$ *must* be written in the numerator for the expression to be "complete," even though it doesn't change the value.

Here is my prediction of the percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=94% B=2% C=2% D=2%
