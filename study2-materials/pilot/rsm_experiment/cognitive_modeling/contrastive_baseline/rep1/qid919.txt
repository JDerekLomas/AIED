This question is a significant "trap" for students across the UK's Foundation and lower-tier Higher GCSE curricula. It tests three distinct skills: understanding of BIDMAS (order of operations), squaring a number, and decimal place value.

The most common error is the order of operations. Many students at lower ability levels will perform $(3 \times 0.3)^2$, leading them to $0.9^2 = 0.81$ (Option A). Others will square the 3 as well as the $x$, or simply treat the decimal as $3 \times 3 \times 3$ without tracking the decimal point, leading to $2.7$ (Option D) or $0.27$ (Option B). 

The correct calculation is $3 \times (0.3 \times 0.3) = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. 

Option D ($2.7$) is a common "distractor" for students who confuse $x^2$ with $2x$ or who perform $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then mistakenly multiply by 3 again or just fail to square correctly. Option C ($1.8$) results from the "doubling" misconception ($3 \times 0.3 \times 2$).
