As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've analyzed this specific question. This is a common "entry point" question for linear equations, but it has a specific structural trap. 

While the equation is $4x + 2y = 10$, students are often conditioned to expect equations in the form $y = mx + c$. Those who lack fluency in algebraic substitution often try to perform a single operation with the numbers they see ($10 \div 4 = 2.5$ or $10 - 4 - 2 = 4$). 

However, the specific choice of $x=0$ simplifies the expression significantly to $2y=10$. This makes it much easier for middle-ability students who might otherwise struggle with two-step substitution. The most common error for basic-level students is picking **A** (multiplying all visible coefficients: $4 \times 5 = 20$ or assuming a different relationship) or **D** (dividing 10 by the first coefficient 4). **C** is the correct answer.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=2% B=3% C=85% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=98% D=1%
