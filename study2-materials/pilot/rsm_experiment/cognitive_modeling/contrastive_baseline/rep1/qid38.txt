As an experienced teacher, I've seen students tackle algebraic fractions many times. Here is my analysis for this specific question:

The common denominator is the primary hurdle here. This question is slightly "easier" than ones with different denominators like $2x$ and $3x$, because one denominator ($x$) is a direct factor of the other ($2x$). However, this "simplicity" creates a trap: many students will simply add the numerators ($3+4$) and then struggle with what to do with the denominators, leading to options B or D. 

*   **Option A (Correct):** Requires multiplying the second fraction by $2/2$ to get $8/2x$, then adding.
*   **Option B:** This is the "add across" error ($3+4=7$) and ($2x+x=3x$). It is very common at lower levels.
*   **Option C:** This happens if students convert the first fraction incorrectly or simply ignore the '2' in $2x$ while adding.
*   **Option D:** This is a very common "halfway" error where students realize the denominator should be $2x$ but forget to double the 4 in the numerator.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%
