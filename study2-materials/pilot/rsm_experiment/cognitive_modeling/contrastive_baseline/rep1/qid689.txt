This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. It is significantly more difficult than $10 = p/5$ because students must perform two steps (multiplication then division) or understand the reciprocal relationship.

The most common error for this specific equation is the **multiplicative reversal**, where students see the numbers 10 and 5 and immediately perform $10 \div 5 = 2$. Even though they know they are "solving," their brain defaults to the easiest division available. The second most common error is **misapplied multiplication**, where students see the fraction bar and assume they must multiply the visible integers ($10 \times 5 = 50$). 

Option A (0.5) is the correct answer ($10p = 5 \rightarrow p = 5/10$), but it is counter-intuitive for lower-ability students who expect the answer to be a whole number when the inputs are 10 and 5.
