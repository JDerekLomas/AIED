This question tests a student's understanding of the order of operations when rearranging equations, specifically the "balance" method versus a rote application of rules.

**Analysis:**
- **Tom** is correct: He adds 5 to both sides first ($\frac{x}{3} = 12 + 5$), which is the standard and easiest first step.
- **Katie** is incorrect: She has multiplied the terms by 3 but failed to multiply the $-5$ by 3. A correct version of her step would be $x - 15 = 36$.
- **The Trap:** This is a classic "fraction" misconception. Lower-ability students often think they can "get rid of the divide by 3" simply by multiplying the other side, forgetting that the 3 must be distributed across the entire side (or every term). Katie’s suggestion looks very plausible to a student who applies "change side, change sign" rules superficially.

**Predicted Performance:**
- **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with equations involving fractions. They are likely to guess or be swayed by the fact that $12 \times 3 = 36$, seeing Katie as "clever" for doing the multiplication.
- **Basic:** This group often remembers they need to do the same thing to both sides, but they frequently make the mistake Katie made—multiplying the $x/3$ and the 12, but neglecting the middle term. Many will choose "Both" because both numbers (17 and 36) relate to the numbers in the question.
- **Proficient:** These students usually follow the standard algorithm of adding/subtracting before multiplying/dividing. Most will see Tom is correct, but a significant portion will still fall for Katie's error because $12 \times 3 = 36$ "looks" right.
- **Advanced:** These students understand that to multiply by 3, you must multiply *every* term. They will immediately spot Katie's error and confidently choose A.

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=40% D=15%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=23% D=2%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=5% D=0%
