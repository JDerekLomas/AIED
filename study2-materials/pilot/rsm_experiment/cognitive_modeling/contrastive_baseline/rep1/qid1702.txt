To answer this question correctly, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, and finally $x = 3.3$.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
The difficulty here lies in the two-step rearrangement involving a subtraction.
*   **The Trap (Option C vs. D):** Students who substitute correctly but fail to inverse the operation ($30 - 3$ instead of $30 + 3$) will arrive at $27/10 = 2.7$ (Option D). This is the most common process error for intermediate students.
*   **The Decimal/Sign Error (Options A and B):** These options represent students who might try to solve for $y$ instead of $x$ or make significant arithmetic errors with the $0.5$ multiplier. Specifically, some may do $(30 + 12.5) / 10 = 4.25$ or similar miscalculations involving confusing the 6 and 10 or flipping the signs.
*   **Complexity:** Since the coefficient of $x$ is 10, the final division is "easy," which usually keeps the success rate higher for proficient students. However, the $0.5 \times 6$ part requires basic numeracy that "below basic" students often stumble on.
