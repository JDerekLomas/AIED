This question tests a student's ability to rearrange a formula involving a cube root, specifically the formula for the volume of a sphere: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

While many students memorise the formula, the difficulty here lies in the algebraic manipulation. To isolate $r$, students must first multiply by $3$ and divide by $4\pi$. A common error is "fragmenting" the fraction (leading to Option B) or incorrectly moving the $4\pi$ (leading to Option A). Option D represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how the cube root applies to the entire expression.

**Teacher's Insight:**
Students in the "Below Basic" and "Basic" categories often struggle with the order of operations when rearranging. Many will instinctively try to "put the numbers on top," making Option B a very attractive distractor. "Proficient" students generally know they need to multiply by 3, which usually leads them to the correct answer (C), though some will still get tangled in the placement of $\pi$. "Advanced" students will find this a standard procedure.

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=15% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=4% C=94% D=1%
