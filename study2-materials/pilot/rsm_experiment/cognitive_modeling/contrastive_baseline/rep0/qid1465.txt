This question tests Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). While the multiplication is relatively straightforward ($4 \times 2 = 8$), the primary "trap" is the order of addition and subtraction ($3 - 5 + 8$). Many students erroneously believe that "Addition" comes before "Subtraction" because A precedes S in the acronym, leading them to calculate $5 + 8 = 13$ first, then $3 - 13 = -10$.

Other students will calculate left-to-right regardless of operators, leading to $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=35% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=1% D=5%
