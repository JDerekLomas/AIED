This question targets a very specific and common point of confusion in solving linear equations: the order of operations when clearing denominators versus terms.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **Tom's method** is the "standard" way taught in most UK classrooms (adding 5 to both sides first). Most students across all ability levels will recognise this as correct.
*   **Katie's method** represents a very common student error. Many students believe they can multiply by 3 to "get rid of the fraction" without multiplying the $-5$ term as well. Katie has effectively done $3 \times (\frac{x}{3}) - 5 = 12 \times 3$.
*   **The Trap:** Because Katie’s method *looks* like a logical step (multiplying by the denominator), many "basic" and "proficient" students will accept it as valid. They often struggle with the distributive property required to make her method work (which would actually be $x - 15 = 36$).
*   **Advanced students** will quickly spot that Katie hasn't multiplied the $-5$ by 3 and will correctly identify that only Tom is right.
