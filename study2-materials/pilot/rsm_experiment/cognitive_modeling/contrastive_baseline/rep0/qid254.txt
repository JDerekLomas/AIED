As a UK maths teacher, I see this specific question as a "trap" regarding the role of zero in data sets and the importance of mathematical notation (BIDMAS).

**The Breakdown:**
*   **The "Zero" Misconception:** Many students believe that because 0 doesn't add value to the sum, it shouldn't be counted in the divisor. This leads them to C. 
*   **The Notation Trap (Option B):** Students often write calculations this way on a scientific calculator. Without brackets around the sum, the calculator only divides the 7 by 5. Many "Basic" students will see the numbers in the right order and pick it without thinking about order of operations.
*   **The Correct Logic (Option A):** While $0+1+3+4+7$ is technically the full sum, $1+3+4+7$ results in the same numerator. Because there are five values in the data set (including the zero), the divisor must be 5. 

**Student Performance Predictions:**

**Below Basic:** These students often ignore zero entirely as a "nothing" number. They will see four "actual" numbers and choose C. Some will pick B simply because it lists all the numbers in a row.
**Basic:** This group is split. They are more likely to recognise that zero is a data point, but they are very susceptible to the "calculator speak" of Option B, forgetting that $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$ is mathematically incorrect due to BIDMAS.
**Proficient:** These students understand that 0 is a value and must be included in the count ($n=5$). They will likely spot that the sum $1+3+4+7$ is equivalent to adding the zero, making A the mathematically sound choice.
**Advanced:** These students will immediately check the divisor ($n=5$) and confirm that adding zero doesn't change the numerator. They will also instantly dismiss B due to BIDMAS.

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=35% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
