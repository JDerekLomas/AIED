As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question by looking at the interaction between the substitution and the equation format. 

The equation $4x + 2y = 10$ is given in implicit form rather than the standard $y = mx + c$. For the value $x=0$, the term $4x$ vanishes, leaving $2y = 10$. This makes the calculation relatively straightforward ($10 \div 2$), but there are two primary "trap" pathways for students:
1. **The "Add the coefficients" error (Option C):** Students see $4x+2y$ and $x=0$, and instinctively think $4(0)$ is $4$ or simply ignore it and assume $2y = 10 \implies y=5$. Wait—$y=5$ is actually the correct answer. The trap here is actually $4+2y=10$, which would lead to $y=3$.
2. **The "Linear Sequence" or "Gradient" error:** Some students see $4x$ and assume the first value must be the coefficient (4) or the result of $10 \div 4$.
3. **Confusion with 0:** Below-basic students often think $4(0) = 4$ or that $x=0$ means $y$ must be the "starting number" if the equation were in a different format.

**Option Analysis:**
- **C (5):** The correct answer ($2y = 10 \implies y = 5$).
- **B (3):** Result of thinking $4(0) = 4$, so $4 + 2y = 10 \implies 2y = 6 \implies y = 3$.
- **A (20):** Result of $4 \times 5$ (multiplying the constants) or misunderstanding the scale.
- **D (2.5):** Result of dividing $10 \div 4$ instead of $10 \div 2$.

Predicting the percentages:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=8% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=97% D=1%
