As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question on adding algebraic fractions as a "medium-difficulty" algebraic task. The core challenge here isn't just common denominators, but the interaction between the coefficients and the variable $x$.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **Option A (Correct):** Students recognize that to get a common denominator of $2x$, they must multiply the second fraction by $2/2$, leading to $3/2x + 8/2x = 11/2x$.
*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** The classic "add the tops, add the bottoms" error ($3+4$ and $2x+x$). This is the most common error for lower-ability students.
*   **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** The student knows to multiply the 4 by 2, but fails to maintain the correct denominator or "simplifies" $2x$ to $x$ incorrectly.
*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** The student identifies $2x$ as the common denominator but forgets to scale the numerator of the second fraction (simply adding $3+4$). This is a very common "mid-level" mistake.

**Efficiency/Difficulty:**
The question is slightly harder than $1/x + 1/x$ because of the mismatched denominators. However, because one denominator is a direct multiple of the other ($2x$ and $x$), it is more accessible than cases requiring a product denominator (like $x$ and $x+1$).

Here is the predicted performance breakdown:
