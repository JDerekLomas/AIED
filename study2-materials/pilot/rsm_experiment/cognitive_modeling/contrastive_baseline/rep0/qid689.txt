This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. While it looks simple, it is notoriously difficult for students below the 'proficient' level.

The most common error is the **"multiplication flip"** (Option B): students see $10$ and $5$ and assume they must multiply them to get $50$, or they follow a flawed "move the 5" rule without understanding the algebra. 

The second common error is the **"simple division"** (Option C): students divide the large number by the small number ($10 \div 5$) because it produces a whole number, ignoring the position of the variable. 

Option A is the correct answer ($10p = 5 \Rightarrow p = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5$). Advanced students handle the fraction swap easily. Proficient students might pause but usually navigate the $0.5$ vs $2$ dilemma. Lower ability levels often default to $2$ because it "feels" like a more natural result of 10 and 5.
