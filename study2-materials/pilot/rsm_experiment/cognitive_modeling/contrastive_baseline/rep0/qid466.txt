This question tests two distinct concepts: the **multiplicative inverse** (reciprocals) and **directed number rules** (multiplying negatives).

The difficulty here lies in the "double negative" trap. While many students know that a number multiplied by its reciprocal equals 1, many instinctively choose the positive reciprocal ($\frac{4}{3}$) because they focus on the "flipping" rule but forget that to result in a negative product ($-1$), the two signs must be different. Since the target is $-1$ and the first number is already negative, the star must be a **positive** value. 

*   **Below Basic** students often struggle with fractions entirely and may pick D or C simply because the numbers look familiar.
*   **Basic** students often remember that fractions "flip" to get to 1, but they are highly susceptible to the "sign-change" habit (thinking they need to change the sign to "cancel it out"), leading them to B.
*   **Proficient** students usually identify the reciprocal ($\frac{4}{3}$) but often pause at the negative sign. A significant portion will overthink the signs and choose B, believing that "two negatives make a positive" applies to the final answer being positive, rather than correctly identifying that the product is negative.
*   **Advanced** students will quickly verify that $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -\frac{12}{12} = -1$.
