In this question, the student is asked to evaluate a two-step linear equation process. Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4). Step 2 contains a very common procedural error: instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$, the student has added 1 ($60 + 1 = 61$).

For **below basic** students, the "look" of the math often dictates the answer; they see a correct-looking first step and often assume the whole process is logical, or they struggle with inverse operations. **Basic** students frequently make the "inverse operation error" (adding instead of subtracting) themselves, meaning they are highly likely to see Step 2 as correct, leading them to choose C. **Proficient** students are usually the ones who catch this specific error, as they are trained to check their "backwards" steps, but a small portion will still rush and pick C. **Advanced** students will see the error instantly.

The most common wrong answer across the board will be **C**, as students often "read" the addition of the 1 and the 60 as a natural progression if they aren't thinking strictly about inverse operations.
