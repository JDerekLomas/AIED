As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common classroom observations and SATs/GCSE performance data.

The primary difficulty in this question is not just the calculation of fractions with different denominators, but the **instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number**. 

- **Option D** represents the most common "Low Ability" error: simply adding the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$).
- **Option A** is the correct numerical value but in an improper fraction format. Many "Proficient" students will convert to improper fractions to do the calculation, reach $\frac{99}{20}$, and stop there, failing to read the final instruction to provide a mixed number.
- **Option B** is the correct mixed number ($4 \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20}$).
- **Option C** occurs when students find a common denominator by multiplying ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but fail to adjust the numerators correctly or get lost in the conversion.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=25% D=45%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=35% B=55% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
