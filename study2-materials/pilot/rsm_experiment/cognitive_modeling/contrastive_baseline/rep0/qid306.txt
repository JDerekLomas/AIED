This question is a classic test of the "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically targeting the most common misconception in the hierarchy: the relationship between Addition and Subtraction.

In **Problem Q**, almost all students from 'Basic' upwards know that multiplication comes before addition. However, in **Problem P**, many students believe that because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym, they *must* perform $5 + 6$ first. This leads to the incorrect answer of $4 - 11 = -7$ (or just confusion). A student who understands that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right will correctly identify that $4 - 5$ should be done first.

Option B is the correct answer. Option D is the "BIDMAS Trap" answer.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=35% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=2% B=85% C=3% D=10%
