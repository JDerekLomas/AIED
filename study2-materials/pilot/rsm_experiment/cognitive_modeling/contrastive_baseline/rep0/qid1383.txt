This question tests two distinct areas: the understanding of negative bases in indices and the common confusion between exponents and multiplication.

The main "trap" here is the sign. Many students (even proficient ones) frequently calculate $3^4 = 81$ but then incorrectly apply the negative sign as $-81$, following a misunderstood rule about "negative in, negative out" or confusing the calculation with $-3^4$ (without brackets). The other common error is the linear misconception, where $k^4$ is treated as $k \times 4$.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **A (81):** The correct answer. Students must correctly identify that $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$ results in a positive product.
*   **B (12):** A common lower-ability error ($3 \times 4$), ignoring the negative sign or thinking it cancels.
*   **C (-81):** The "proficient mistake." Students do the exponentiation correctly but forget that an even power turns a negative base positive. This is the most popular distractor for mid-to-high ability students.
*   **D (-12):** The lowest-tier error ($ -3 \times 4$).
