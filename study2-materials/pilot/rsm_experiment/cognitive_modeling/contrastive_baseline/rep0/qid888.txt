As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this quadratic expansion by looking at the two primary failure points for students: the sum of the linear terms ($-5 + -7$) and the product of the constants ($-5 \times -7$).

This specific question is moderately difficult because both signs are negative. Students often struggle with "double negatives" in two different ways here. First, there is the risk of correctly adding -5 and -7 to get -12, but then failing the multiplication (getting -35). Second, there is the risk of "combining" the signs incorrectly (getting -2 or +12). 

Option D is the most common "strong distractor" because students often remember that a "minus and a minus make a plus" for the middle term (incorrectly applied) or, more commonly, they correctly calculate $-12m$ but forget that $-5 \times -7$ results in a positive $+35$.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
