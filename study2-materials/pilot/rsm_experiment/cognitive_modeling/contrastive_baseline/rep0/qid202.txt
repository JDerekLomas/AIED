This question tests the addition of mixed numbers with common denominators. It is considered a "low-demand" fractions question because there is no regrouping required (the sum of the fractional parts is less than 1) and no need to find a common denominator.

The primary distractors are:
- **D**: The most common conceptual error where students add the denominators ($5+5=10$).
- **B**: Converting correctly to an improper fraction but failing to follow the instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number."
- **C**: A combination of adding denominators and incorrect conversion/multiplication.

**Analysis of student performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many struggle with the "add the denominators" trap or lack a solid grasp of how whole numbers and fractions interact.
*   **Basic:** Most understand they need to add the wholes and the parts separately, but a significant portion will still fall for Option D or fail to read the specific instruction regarding mixed numbers.
*   **Proficient:** These students generally perform the calculation correctly but are occasionally caught out by not reading the "Leave your answer as..." instruction (leading to B).
*   **Advanced:** Almost all will get this right; it is a very straightforward calculation for this level.

below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=1% D=4%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
