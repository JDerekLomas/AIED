To solve this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, and finally $x = 3.3$.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
This question is a significant "trap" for lower-ability students because the variables are not in the standard $y = mx + c$ format. 
1. **The Inverse Error:** Many students see the $10x$ and $30$ and immediately try to perform $30 \div 10 = 3$. They then try to incorporate the $0.5$ or the $6$ incorrectly.
2. **Operation Sign Error:** A common mistake when solving $10x - 3 = 30$ is to subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it, leading to $10x = 27$, which results in **Option D (2.7)**. This is the most common distractor for students with basic algebraic skills.
3. **Variable Swap:** Some students will plug $0.5$ in for $x$ instead of $y$. $10(0.5) = 5$, then $5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25$. This leads to messy decimals (roughly $-4.16$) which students might round to **Option B (-4.25)**.
4. **Proficiency Gap:** "Proficient" students usually handle the substitution well but often stumble on the two-step equation solve (the $-3$ becoming $+3$). "Advanced" students find this trivial as they are comfortable with linear rearrangement.
