This question tests the transition from arithmetic notation ($\div$) to algebraic notation (fraction bars). It also assesses the student's understanding of the order of operations and how brackets dictate what belongs in the denominator.

The primary "trap" is Option D (the reciprocal), which is a common error for students who understand that a fraction bar means division but forget which term is the divisor. Option C is a significant distractor for students who don't recognise that the bracket forces the entire $(h+4)$ to be the denominator.

**below_basic:** Students at this level often struggle with the visual translation of division. Many will choose C because it looks like a "partial" translation, or D because they associate algebra with flipping terms.
**basic:** These students generally know that division becomes a fraction bar. However, a significant number will still be tempted by D or fail to realize that the brackets in $c \div (h+4)$ mean the $+4$ cannot be separated (Option C).
**proficient:** Most students at this level have mastered the convention that the term following the $\div$ symbol is the denominator. The main error here is the occasional lapse in direction (Option D).
**advanced:** This is a very straightforward question for high-ability students. Almost all will correctly identify A as the standard convention.

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=65% B=5% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=5% D=8%
advanced: A=97% B=1% C=1% D=1%
