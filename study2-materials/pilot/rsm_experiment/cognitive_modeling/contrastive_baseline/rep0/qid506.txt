As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as one that tests fraction manipulation within a basic linear equation. The trap here is the numerical relationship between 3 and 12. 

Many students at the lower levels will see $3$ and $12$ and immediately think $12 \div 3 = 4$, leading them to Option A ($1/4$) or Option C ($4$). Option A is particularly attractive because it preserves the fraction structure. The correct operation—dividing by 3 (which is multiplying the denominator by 3)—is a frequent stumbling block; many students incorrectly multiply the numerator ($3/12 = 1/4$) or subtract.

**Option Analysis:**
- **A ($1/4$):** The most common distractor. Students divide 12 by 3 instead of dividing $1/12$ by 3.
- **B ($1/36$):** The correct answer. Requires understanding that dividing a fraction by an integer involves multiplying the denominator.
- **C ($4$):** Basic reciprocal/division error, ignoring the fraction context entirely.
- **D ($1/9$):** A less common error where students might try to square root or misapply the $3 \times 3$ logic if they get confused with similar-looking square problems.

Here is the predicted performance breakdown:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=75% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=97% C=1% D=0%
