As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common student performance during the expansion of binomials.

**Analysis:**
This question tests two specific areas: the multiplication of negative integers and the distinction between multiplying and adding. 
*   **The Trap:** Many students at the lower ability levels see $-1$ and $-4$ and instinctively perform $(-1) + (-4)$ to get $-5$ (Option D) or simply add the absolute values to get $5$ (Option C), forgetting that "expanding" or "following arrows" implies multiplication.
*   **Sign Errors:** Students who know to multiply may still struggle with the "negative times a negative equals a positive" rule, leading them to $-4$ (Option B).
*   **The "Easy" Factor:** For proficient and advanced students, this is a very straightforward task, as they have automated the process of multiplying the constants during FOIL/Grid method.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses:

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=55% B=20% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
