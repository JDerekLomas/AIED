As an experienced UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question on adding algebraic fractions as follows:

This question tests a student's ability to find a common denominator. The most common pitfall in this specific problem is the "add the tops, add the bottoms" error (Choice B) and the error where students forget to scale the numerator when making the denominators match (Choice D). Choice A is the correct answer ($\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$).

**Student Behavior Analysis:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many students at this level will treat the fractions like whole numbers or simply add across. Choice B ($3+4$ and $2x+x$) is the classic "intuitive" wrong answer for those who don't understand fractions. Choice D is also very popular here as they see the $3$ and $4$ and just pick a denominator they recognise.
*   **Basic:** These students know they need a common denominator but often fail at the execution. A significant portion will turn the second fraction into $\frac{4}{2x}$ (forgetting to multiply the 4 by 2), leading them to $3+4=7$ over $2x$ (Choice D).
*   **Proficient:** Most students at this level have mastered the process of equivalent fractions. However, under exam pressure, some still default to adding across or forgetting to double the 4.
*   **Advanced:** This is a routine procedural task for these students. Errors will be negligible and usually due to extreme haste.

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=2% D=13%
advanced: A=97% B=1% C=1% D=1%
