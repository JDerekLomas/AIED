As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on how students handle implicit equations versus the more standard $y = mx + c$ format.

The specific difficulty here lies in the substitution into an equation where $y$ is not the subject. However, because $x=0$, the term $4x$ disappears, leaving the relatively simple $2y=10$. 

**Breakdown of choices:**
*   **C (5):** The correct answer ($2y=10 \Rightarrow y=5$).
*   **B (3):** A very common "working backwards" error where students see the 4 and 2 in the equation, assume $y = 10 - 4 - 3$ or some other arithmetic combination, or confuse the coefficient with the constant.
*   **D (2.5):** An error where students divide the wrong way or try to perform $10 \div 4$.
*   **A (20):** A common multiplication error ($2 \times 10$) or misidentifying the relationship between the coefficients.

**Assessment of Ability Levels:**
- **Below Basic:** Many struggle with the "0" substitution. Some will try to combine all numbers seen ($4+2=6$, $10-6=4$, etc.) or guess A because it looks "mathsy".
- **Basic:** Students often perform the substitution $4(0)=0$ correctly but might trip on the division $2y=10$, or they may simply subtract 5 from 10 because they are used to simpler linear patterns.
- **Proficient:** These students generally handle $x=0$ well as a "shortcut" and can solve a one-step equation ($2y=10$) with high accuracy.
- **Advanced:** This is a 5-second question for them. Errors are almost non-existent unless it's a "transfer to paper" slip.
