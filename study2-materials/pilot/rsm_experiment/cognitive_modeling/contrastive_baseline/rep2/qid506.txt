As an experienced UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as a classic "fraction arithmetic vs. algebraic manipulation" trap. While the algebra is a simple one-step division ($p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3$), many students struggle with the reciprocal nature of dividing by a whole number when a fraction is already present.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **B (Correct):** Students must multiply the denominator by 3 (or multiply by $\frac{1}{3}$).
*   **A (Most common error):** Students see the 3 and the 12 and perform $12 \div 3$ instead of $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$. This is a very strong "intuitive" pull for lower-ability students.
*   **C (Inversion error):** Students rearrange to $12 \div 3$ but lose the fraction entirely, or solve as if the equation were $\frac{p}{3} = 12$ or $\frac{3}{p} = \frac{1}{12}$.
*   **D (Calculation error):** Less common, usually a result of mistaking the relationship (e.g., $12-3$) or a processing error.

The "Advanced" cohort will see this instantly as $\frac{1}{36}$, while the "Below Basic" cohort will almost exclusively be drawn to Option A because the numbers 3 and 12 suggest the number 4 through basic division, regardless of their position in the equation.

below_basic: A=65% B=10% C=15% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
