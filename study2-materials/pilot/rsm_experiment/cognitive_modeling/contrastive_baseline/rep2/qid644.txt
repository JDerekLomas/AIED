This question tests a very specific sub-skill of binomial expansion: the multiplication of two negative constants. While the expansion of $(2p-1)(3p-4)$ as a whole can be challenging for lower-ability students, this question isolates a single step.

The primary distractors here are based on two common errors: 
1. **Additive Thinking:** Students who see numbers and "combine" them rather than multiplying (leading to $-5$ or $+5$).
2. **The Negative Sign:** Students who know they should multiply $1 \times 4$ but struggle with the "negative times a negative" rule, leading them to choose $-4$.

The numbers $1$ and $4$ are "low load," meaning students aren't distracted by complex arithmetic, but the "minus" signs are positioned such that they are easy to overlook or misinterpret as subtraction operations rather than properties of the terms. 

**Below Basic:** Many students at this level revert to addition when they see brackets, particularly if they are overwhelmed by the algebra. $-1 - 4 = -5$ is a very common mistake.
**Basic:** Students likely know to multiply ($1 \times 4 = 4$), but "negative times negative equals positive" is one of the most frequently forgotten rules under pressure. Many will select $-4$ thinking the "negative stays."
**Proficient:** These students generally know the signs rule, but a small percentage will still make a "slip" or choose $-5$ if they misread the operation.
**Advanced:** Almost all students will correctly identify $-1 \times -4 = +4$.
