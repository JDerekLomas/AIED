This question tests two distinct areas: the understanding of index notation (powers) and the rules regarding negative bases. 

The most common error for lower-ability students is to treat $k^4$ as $k \times 4$ (leading to B or D). For mid-range students, the "trap" is the negative sign. While $k^4$ where $k = -3$ is $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$, many students instinctively believe that "a negative number to a power must stay negative," or they perform the calculation as $-(3^4)$, which leads to -81. 

Even proficient students often struggle with the distinction between $-3^4$ and $(-3)^4$. Since the substitution $T=k^4$ implies the entire value of $k$ is raised to the power, the answer is 81. However, the prevalence of the "negative stays negative" misconception makes option C a very strong distractor for all but the most confident students.
