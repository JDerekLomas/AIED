As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on the typical performance of Key Stage 3 and GCSE students. 

This question tests three things: common denominators, adding mixed numbers, and following the instruction to provide a mixed number.

**Key Observations:**
1.  **The "Add across" Trap (D):** This is the classic misconception where students add the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$). At "below basic" and "basic" levels, this is a very high-probability error.
2.  **Improper vs. Mixed Number (A):** Option A ($99/20$) is mathematically equivalent to the correct answer. However, the question explicitly asks for a **mixed number**. Lower-ability students often stop at the improper fraction because they feel they have "done the hard bit," while advanced students follow the specific constraint.
3.  **Calculation Error (C):** Option C combines the denominator multiplication error ($10 \times 4 = 40$) with an improper fraction format.

**Distribution Analysis:**
- **Below Basic:** Most will choose D (the easiest "intuitive" path) or make a mistake that leads to an improper fraction with the wrong denominator.
- **Basic:** Will attempt a common denominator (likely 20 or 40). Many will forget to scale the numerators correctly or will default to the improper fraction A because it looks "more like a maths answer."
- **Proficient:** Usually handles the common denominator well but can occasionally be tripped up by the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number," potentially selecting A.
- **Advanced:** High success rate. They identify the LCM of 10 and 4 as 20, compute $2\frac{14}{20} + 2\frac{5}{20} = 4\frac{19}{20}$, and strictly follow the formatting instruction.

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=30% B=45% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=80% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=3% B=96% C=0% D=1%
