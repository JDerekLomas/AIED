To answer this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$ and solve for $x$.

**Analysis:**
This question is more difficult than a standard "find $y$ when given $x$" because $x$ is the subject to be found.
1.  **The Substitution:** $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$ leads to $10x - 3 = 30$. 
2.  **The Rearranging:** Many students will make a sign error. Instead of adding 3 ($10x = 33 \rightarrow x = 3.3$), they will subtract 3 ($10x = 27 \rightarrow x = 2.7$). Option D is a very strong distractor for this reason.
3.  **The Decimal Multiplication:** Some students struggle to halve 6 or correctly multiply $6 \times 0.5$, leading to incorrect constants.
4.  **Inverse Operations:** Lower-ability students often guess based on the numbers visible ($30/10 + 0.5 \times 2.5 \dots$) or perform operations in the wrong order.

**Distribution Prediction:**

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=35% D=40%
(Lower ability students are very likely to perform $30 - 3 = 27$ then divide by 10, choosing D. They are also prone to random guessing between the decimals).

basic: A=10% B=5% C=45% D=40%
(Basic students understand the process of substitution but frequently make the "additive inverse" error, moving $-3$ across the equals sign as another $-3$).

proficient: A=5% B=2% C=78% D=15%
(Proficient students usually handle the substitution $6 \times 0.5$ correctly and are more cautious with the algebraic steps, though some will still fall for the sign error in D).

advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
(Advanced students will fluently solve the linear equation and are unlikely to make the sign error).
