This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. Even though the numbers are small, it is surprisingly difficult for students below a "proficient" level because it triggers two specific errors:

1.  **Commutative Misconception:** Students often assume division works like multiplication or addition. They see $10$, $5$, and $p$, and mentally calculate $10 \div 5$ to get $p=2$. This is the most common error.
2.  **Inverse Operation Error:** Students see the $10$ and $5$ and instinctively multiply them, resulting in $p=50$.

**A ($p=0.5$)** is the correct answer. To get here, a student must either multiply by $p$ then divide by $10$ ($10p = 5$), or recognize that for the result to be larger than the numerator, the denominator must be a decimal between $0$ and $1$.

**C ($p=2$)** is the strongest "distractor." Students who are used to simple equations where they divide the larger number by the smaller one will gravitate here.

**B ($p=50$)** catches students who struggle with the structure of fractions and perform a blind multiplication.
