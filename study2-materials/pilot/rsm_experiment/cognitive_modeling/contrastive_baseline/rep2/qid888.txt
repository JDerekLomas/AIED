This question tests the expansion of two binomial brackets, specifically focusing on the handling of directed numbers (negative signs).

**Analysis for Teacher's Perspective:**
1.  **The "Middle Term" Error:** Students often sum $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$. This leads them to B, C, or D. Lower-ability students often confuse the "difference" and "sum," sometimes leading them to $-2$ (Option A), though this is more common when the signs are different.
2.  **The "Last Term" Error (The Trap):** The most significant discriminator here is the constant term: $(-5) \times (-7)$. A very common mistake across below_basic and basic levels is to believe that "a minus and a minus make a minus" or simply to forget the sign change, leading them to $-35$ (Option D).
3.  **Sign Confusion:** Option C is for students who understand the "two negatives make a plus" rule but apply it haphazardly to the middle term addition as well.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=10% B=45% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%
