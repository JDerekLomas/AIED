This question is a classic test of "order of operations" in reverse when solving linear equations.

Tom is correct because he adds 5 to both sides ($\frac{x}{3} = 12 + 5 = 17$). This is the standard first step.
Katie is **incorrect**. Students often mistakenly believe they can multiply by 3 while leaving the $-5$ as it is. For Katie to be correct, she would have had to multiply *every* term by 3, resulting in $x - 15 = 36$.

**Analysis of student performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the concept of "both" being an option and frequently pick one person at random or assume that because both have different numbers, one must be wrong and one must be right.
*   **Basic:** This is the peak group for the "Katie error" (Option C). Many students at this level have learned to "get rid of the fraction" first but do not realize the multiplier must apply to the constant term. They will see Katie's $12 \times 3 = 36$ and think it looks correct.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually recognize Tom is definitely right. They may pause at Katie; some will fall for the trap, but most who have mastered multi-step equations will see the $x - 15$ error.
*   **Advanced:** These students will instantly recognize that Tom followed the standard algorithm and Katie missed a term in her distribution of the multiplier.
