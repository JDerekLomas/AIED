This question tests the transition from arithmetic notation ($\div$) to algebraic notation (the fraction bar). While it seems straightforward, the presence of the brackets is the key differentiator. Students who struggle with BIDMAS often fail to recognise the fraction bar as a grouping symbol that replaces the need for brackets.

**Option A** is the correct answer. 
**Option B** is a "distractor for the sake of it," though some very low-ability students may try to "match" the 4 into both terms.
**Option C** is the most common error among "Basic" and "Below Basic" students. They translate the $c \div h$ first and then append the $+4$, ignoring the role of the brackets.
**Option D** represents a reversal error, common among students who know fractions represent division but aren't sure which variable is the dividend and which is the divisor.

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=65% B=5% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=88% B=2% C=7% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
