This order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) question is a classic "trap" for students across all ability levels due to the specific arrangement of the operators.

The primary pitfall here is not the multiplication (which most know comes first), but the subtraction and addition that remain ($3 - 5 + 8$). A significant number of students believe that **A**ddition must always come before **S**ubtraction because the 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym. This leads them to calculate $5 + 8 = 13$ first, followed by $3 - 13 = -10$ (Option D).

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A (6):** Correct. $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6$.
*   **B (4):** A common "left-to-right" error without BIDMAS: $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$.
*   **C (-12):** Left-to-right calculation with an arithmetic error, or doing $3 - (5+4) \times 2$.
*   **D (-10):** The most common "high-level" misconception. Students correctly do multiplication first but then incorrectly believe Addition *must* happen before Subtraction ($3 - (5+8)$).

**Predictions:**
