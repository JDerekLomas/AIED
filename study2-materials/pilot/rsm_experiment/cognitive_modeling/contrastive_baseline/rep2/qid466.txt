This question is a classic test of the "reciprocal" versus "negative reciprocal" misconception. While it appears straightforward, the inclusion of the negative signs creates a high friction point for students who are used to simply "flipping" a fraction to get 1, without accounting for the fact that the result here must be -1.

Students at lower levels often focus on the visual "completeness" of the fraction, while students at higher levels may occasionally overthink the rule for perpendicular gradients (negative reciprocal) and incorrectly apply it here. However, the most common error is choosing the positive reciprocal (Option A) because they focus on the "flip" and lose track of the sign required to result in -1.

**Difficulty Analysis:**
- **The Trap:** A student who knows that a fraction times its reciprocal equals **1** will instinctively pick $A$ $(\frac{4}{3})$. Because the target is **-1**, they actually need to multiply by the *positive* version of the reciprocal, as $(- \times + = -)$. 
- **The Distractor:** $B$ $(-\frac{4}{3})$ is the "negative reciprocal," which is a very strong distractor for proficient students who have recently studied linear graphs ($m_1m_2 = -1$). They might reflexively choose the negative reciprocal even though, in this specific case, that would result in positive 1.
