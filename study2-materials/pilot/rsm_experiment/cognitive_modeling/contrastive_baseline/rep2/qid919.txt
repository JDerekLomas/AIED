This question is a significant "trap" for students across the UK's KS3 and GCSE levels because it combines two common areas of difficulty: the order of operations (BIDMAS) and squaring decimals.

The most common error in this specific problem is the "Linear-Square" confusion ($3 \times 0.3 = 0.9 \to 0.9^2 = 0.81$, option **A**) or the "Decimal-Scaling" error ($3 \times 0.3^2 = 3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$, option **D**). Many students incorrectly calculate $0.3^2$ as $0.9$ instead of $0.09$. Option **B** ($0.27$) is the correct answer ($3 \times 0.09$), but it requires a level of decimal precision that often eludes "basic" and "below basic" students. Option **C** ($1.8$) is usually a result of multiplying the base and the exponent ($3 \times 0.3 \times 2$).

The specific number $0.3$ is a "hard" choice because $3^2=9$ and $0.3 \times 3 = 0.9$, making both $0.9$ and $0.09$ look "correct" to a struggling student.
