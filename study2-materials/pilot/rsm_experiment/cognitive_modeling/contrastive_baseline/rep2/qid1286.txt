This question tests a student's ability to rearrange a formula involving a cube root and fractions. While the volume of a sphere formula is standard (provided in GCSE formulae sheets), the algebraic manipulation required to isolate $r$ is a significant hurdle for many.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **Option C** is the correct answer.
*   **Option A** is a common mistake where students multiply by the numerator and denominator incorrectly (essentially flipping the fraction the wrong way during the cross-multiplication step).
*   **Option B** is a very frequent error; students remember they need to divide by $\pi$, but they struggle with where the 4 and 3 go, often simply "moving" the $4/3$ without reciprocating it.
*   **Option D** represents a total failure of algebraic notation, where the cube root is applied only to the $V$ and the constants are left as a linear multiplier/divider.

**Difficulty assessment:**
For **below_basic** students, the cube root symbol is intimidating, and they often guess based on which "looks" like the original formula (usually picking A or B). **Proficient** students generally know they need to multiply by 3 and divide by 4, but a surprising number make a slip in the visual arrangement of the fraction under the radical.

below_basic: A=30% B=35% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
