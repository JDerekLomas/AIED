In this question, the student is asked to evaluate two distinct algebraic steps. 

Step 1 is correct: Isaac correctly multiplies both sides by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). 
Step 2 is incorrect: Isaac has added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting it ($60 - 1 = 59$).

The difficulty here lies in the "Two-Step" nature of the check. Many lower-ability students see a "correct-looking" numerical relationship (60 and 61 are consecutive) and assume the logic holds, or they perform the same inverse operation error Isaac did while checking the work. 

**Below Basic:** Students at this level often struggle with inverse operations. Many will see $60=1+k$ and automatically think $k$ must be 61 because they see an addition sign and perform addition, or they simply guess because the multi-step logic is overwhelming.
**Basic:** These students usually recognize that Step 1 is correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$). However, a significant portion will fall into the trap in Step 2, failing to notice that Isaac added 1 instead of subtracting it, leading them to choose "Both steps are correct."
**Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of inverse operations. They will identify that $k$ should be 59 and therefore spot the error in Step 2, while correctly validating Step 1.
**Advanced:** These students will methodically check both steps and rarely miss the sign error in the second step.
