As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen this specific problem type trip up students for two distinct reasons: the inclusion of **zero** and the **Order of Operations (BIDMAS)**.

Option A is the correct answer. Even though 0 has no numerical value in the sum, it is a data point and must be included in the divisor. 
Option B tests BIDMAS. Students often write calculations this way on a scientific calculator ($0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$), which results in $15.4$ instead of $3$ because the calculator only divides the $7$ by $5$.
Option C represents the "ignore the zero" misconception, where students believe that if a number has no value, it doesn't count as a "number of values."

Here is my prediction of the performance distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=40% D=5%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=12% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
