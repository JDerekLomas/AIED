This question tests the addition of mixed numbers with common denominators. It is considered a relatively straightforward question because the sum of the fractional parts ($\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$) does not require regrouping (bridging the whole). 

However, there are two primary "traps" for students:
1.  **Denominator Addition (Option D):** This is the most common error in fraction addition, where students add both the numerators and the denominators ($1+2=3$ and $5+5=10$).
2.  **Instruction Ignorance (Option B):** The question asks for a mixed number. $\frac{18}{5}$ is mathematically equivalent but is an improper fraction. High-ability students who convert everything to improper fractions first to calculate may select this if they don't read the final instruction.
3.  **The "Add Everything" Error (Option C):** Combining the denominator addition with an error in calculating the whole numbers/numerators.

**Teacher's Note:** Because the numbers are small and the denominators are already the same, the vast majority of "Proficient" and "Advanced" students will find this trivial. The main differentiator at the lower levels is the urge to add the denominators.
