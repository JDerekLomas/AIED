This question addresses two core components of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS): the priority of multiplication over addition, and the left-to-right convention for addition and subtraction.

Problem Q is a standard test of BIDMAS, where most students recognize that the multiplication must come first. However, Problem P is a classic "trap" for students who follow the acronym too literally. Many students believe "A" (Addition) must strictly come before "S" (Subtraction) because of the letter order in BIDMAS, leading them to prioritize $5+6$ (often incorrectly getting $4-11$).

**Teacher Analysis:**
*   **Problem P:** This is the high-error part. Students across below_basic to proficient levels are highly likely to choose "Addition first" because they have been taught the acronym but not the "equal priority/left-to-right" rule.
*   **Problem Q:** Even weaker students generally recognize that multiplication is "more powerful" than addition, making option B the mathematically correct path and option D the most common "rule-based" error.

Below are the predicted percentages based on UK classroom performance:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=55% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%
