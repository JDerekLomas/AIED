### Student 1 [ability: basic]
"Okay, division in algebra usually looks like a fraction. So it's $c$ on the top and $h+4$ on the bottom. Let's look at the options. A has $c$ on top and $h+4$ on the bottom. D has $h+4$ on top. Which way does it go? Usually the first number goes on top. So $c$ is first, it goes on top. That's A."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 2 [ability: below_basic]
"I hate division. $c \div (h+4)$. Maybe I just remove the bracket? So $c \div h + 4$. That looks like $c$ over $h$ then plus $4$. That's option C. It looks cleaner than the others."
**Final answer choice: C**

### Student 3 [ability: proficient]
"The division sign $\div$ is replaced by the fraction bar in algebraic notation. The term before the sign is the numerator ($c$) and the expression in brackets is the entire denominator ($h+4$). The brackets mean the $h+4$ stays together as one block. So it has to be $c$ over the whole of $h+4$."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 4 [ability: basic]
"I remember the teacher saying brackets go at the bottom if they follow a divide sign. So it's something over $h+4$. A has that. B also has that, but where did the extra $+4$ on the top come from? That doesn't make sense. I'll go with A because it's the only one that didn't add random numbers."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 5 [ability: below_basic]
"The question has $c$, $h$, and $4$. All the answers have those. Wait, D looks more 'mathsy' because the bigger bit is on the top. I think you always put the long bit on top of the short bit. Yeah, that looks right."
**Final answer choice: D**

### Student 6 [ability: advanced]
"This is a straightforward conversion from infix notation to fractional notation. $c$ is the dividend and $(h+4)$ is the divisor. In algebra, we represent $a \div b$ as $\frac{a}{b}$. Therefore, $c$ is the numerator and the binomial $(h+4)$ is the denominator. Option A is the standard representation."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 7 [ability: proficient]
"Right, $c \div (h+4)$. Everything in the parentheses has to be under the division bar. Option C is wrong because the 4 isn't being divided. Option D is upside down—that would be $(h+4) \div c$. So it must be A. B is just weird, it adds a 4 to the $c$ for no reason."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 8 [ability: basic]
"I've seen these before. Divide means fraction. So it's $c/h+4$. Let me check the list. A is $\frac{c}{h+4}$. C is $\frac{c}{h}+4$. Oh no, which one is it? In the original question, the $+4$ is inside the bracket with the $h$, so they should probably stay together under the line. I'll pick A."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 9 [ability: below_basic]
"Uh... algebra. $c \div h + 4$. There's a $c$, there's an $h$, and there's a $4$. If I add them all together maybe? No, that's not an option. B has two 4s in it. There's a 4 in the question, so maybe it's B because it has more numbers? I don't know, I'll just guess B."
**Final answer choice: B**

### Student 10 [ability: basic]
"The divide sign means fraction bar. $c$ goes on top, $h+4$ goes on bottom. If I look at D, it's the wrong way around. A is $c$ over $h+4$. C is $c$ over $h$ and then $+4$. Because the $h+4$ is in brackets, the line has to go under both of them. So it's A."
**Final answer choice: A**
