"Okay, let's look at the equation: $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$. Tom wants to isolate the $\frac{x}{3}$ term first. To do that, he'd add $5$ to both sides. $12 + 5 = 17$, so $\frac{x}{3} = 17$ is perfectly valid. Now Katie... she's trying to get rid of the fraction first. To do that, she needs to multiply the *entire* left side by $3$. $3 \times (\frac{x}{3} - 5)$ becomes $x - 15$. But she wrote $x - 5$. She multiplied the $x/3$ and the $12$ by $3$, but forgot to multiply the $-5$ by $3$. That’s a classic expansion error. So Tom is right, but Katie is wrong."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 2 [ability: below_basic]**
"I hate fractions. Tom says $\frac{x}{3} = 17$. If I put $17$ in there, $17$ divided by $3$ is... uh... $5.66$. That doesn't look like $12$. Katie says $x - 5 = 36$. $36$ plus $5$ is $41$. I don't know what they are doing. Let me look at the numbers. $3 \times 12$ is $36$. Katie has $36$ in hers, so she's probably right. Tom just added $12$ and $5$ to get $17$. You aren't allowed to just move numbers across the equals sign like that without changing the bottom number. I'll go with Katie."
**Final Answer: B**

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
"To solve $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$, you usually add $5$ first. $12 + 5$ is $17$, so $\frac{x}{3} = 17$. Tom is correct. If you wanted to multiply by $3$ first like Katie did, you have to multiply every single term. $3 \times \frac{x}{3} = x$, $3 \times 5 = 15$, and $3 \times 12 = 36$. So the line should be $x - 15 = 36$. Katie kept the $5$ as it was, so she's wrong. Only Tom is right."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
"If $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$, then I can move the minus $5$ to the other side and it becomes plus $5$. So $\frac{x}{3} = 12 + 5$, which is $\frac{x}{3} = 17$. That's what Tom said. Now Katie... she has $36$ on the right. She must have done $12 \times 3$. If you multiply one side by $3$, you do the other side too. $\frac{x}{3} \times 3$ is $x$. So $x - 5 = 36$. Wait, that looks correct too. You just multiply the $x$ part and the end part. I think they both found different ways to start."
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
"Tom has $17$. $12 + 5 = 17$. Katie has $36$. $12 \times 3 = 36$. Both of those use the numbers in the question. In math, usually there's more than one way to do it. Both of them did a calculation that makes sense with the numbers I see. I'll guess C because usually these questions want both people to be right."
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 6 [ability: proficient]**
"Equation: $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$. Tom's method: Add $5$ to both sides. $\frac{x}{3} = 17$. This is a standard first step. Katie's method: Multiply by $3$. When you multiply an equation by a number, you must multiply every term. Left side: $3(\frac{x}{3} - 5) = x - 15$. Right side: $3(12) = 36$. Katie wrote $x - 5 = 36$. She missed the $15$. Only Tom is correct."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
"Let me try to solve it. $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$. First, $+5$ to both sides. $\frac{x}{3} = 17$. Then multiply by $3$. $x = 17 \times 3 = 51$. Let's check Katie's. If $x - 5 = 36$, then $x = 41$. But I just found $x = 51$. If $x$ is $51$, then $51 - 5$ is not $36$. So Katie must be wrong. Tom's line was exactly what I did in my first step."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
"Tom is definitely right because $12 + 5 = 17$. For Katie, she's trying to cancel out the 'divided by $3$'. If you multiply the whole thing by $3$, the fraction goes away to leave $x$. And $12$ times $3$ is $36$. The $5$ doesn't have a $3$ under it, so maybe you don't have to multiply it? $x - 5 = 36$. It looks okay. I remember my teacher saying you have to do the same thing to everything, but the $5$ is already 'normal'. I'm confused. I'll just pick C because they both look like they followed 'the rules' of opposites."
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 9 [ability: advanced]**
"The equation is $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$. Tom adds $5$ to both sides, which is a perfectly valid property of equality. $\frac{x}{3} = 17$ is correct. Katie wants to eliminate the denominator. To do this, she must apply the distributive property: $3 \times (\frac{x}{3} - 5) = 3 \times 12$. This results in $x - 15 = 36$. Katie's line is $x - 5 = 36$, meaning she failed to distribute the $3$ to the $-5$. Therefore, Katie is incorrect. Only Tom is right."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 10 [ability: below_basic]**
"I'll try to solve it... $x$ over $3$ minus $5$... if I move the $3$ it becomes $x - 5 = 12 \times 3$. So $x - 5 = 36$. That's what Katie said. Tom said $x/3 = 17$. That also works because $12 + 5$ is $17$. I think both of them just moved a number to the other side. My brother said you can move any number you want as long as you change the sign or do the opposite. They both did that. So C."
**Final Answer: C**
