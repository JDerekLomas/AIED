### Student 1 [ability: basic]
"Okay, mean means average. I have to add them up and divide by how many there are. Let's count them: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. That's five numbers. So I need to divide by 5. A and B both have a 5. A doesn't have the 0 at the top, but adding 0 doesn't change anything, right? 1+3+4+7 is 15. 0+1+3+4+7 is also 15. So A looks okay. Wait, B says $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. That's the same thing. But A is a fraction which usually means divide. I'll go with A because it looks more like how the teacher writes it on the board."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 2 [ability: below_basic]
"Mean... that's the one where you find the middle? No, that's median. Mean is adding. 1 plus 3 is 4, plus 4 is 8, plus 7 is 15. There are 4 numbers. Oh wait, there is a zero. But zero is nothing. So there are 4 numbers that matter. If I divide 15 by 4, that's C. You don't count the zero because it's not a value."
**Final Answer: C**

### Student 3 [ability: proficient]
"To find the mean, I sum all the terms and divide by the count $n$. The terms are 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. The sum is $0+1+3+4+7 = 15$. The count is $n=5$. So the expression should be $(0+1+3+4+7)/5$ or $15/5$. Looking at the options: A has the correct denominator (5) and the sum at the top is the same as the total sum because adding 0 doesn't change the numerator. Let me check B. B is $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. Oh, order of operations! BODMAS means only the 7 is divided by 5. So B is wrong. A is correct."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 4 [ability: basic]
"I remember this. Add them up, divide by how many. $0+1+3+4+7$. That's five numbers. The divide sign is the line in the fraction or the $\div$ symbol. B has the $\div$ symbol and it includes all the numbers including the 0. A is missing the 0. You have to include all the numbers in the list. So B must be the right way to write it."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 5 [ability: below_basic]
"0, 1, 3, 4, 7. Adding them up... $1+3=4$, $4+4=8$, $8+7=15$. There are 5 numbers? No, 0 doesn't count. So 4 numbers. $15 \div 4$. That's C. But wait, what if I have to include the 0? Then it's $15 \div 5$. Option B has a $\div 5$ and all the numbers are there. I'll pick B, it looks like the whole sum."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 6 [ability: advanced]
"The mean is $\sum x / n$. Here, $n=5$ because the zero is a data point. The sum is $0+1+3+4+7 = 15$. The calculation should be $15/5 = 3$. 
Option A: $(1+3+4+7)/5 = 15/5 = 3$. This is mathematically correct. 
Option B: $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. According to BIDMAS, this is $0+1+3+4+(7/5)$, which is $8+1.4 = 9.4$. Incorrect. 
Option C: $15/4$. Incorrect, wrong $n$. 
Since A gives the correct numerical result and represents the correct logic (since adding 0 is identity), A is the answer."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 7 [ability: proficient]
"Calculating mean: total sum divided by the number of values. There are 5 values. So the bottom of the fraction must be 5. That eliminates C. Now, A or B? B looks like the standard way to write it, but without brackets, the division only applies to the 7. That's a classic trick question. A has 5 on the bottom, and the top is $1+3+4+7$. Is that right? $0+1+3+4+7$ is the same as $1+3+4+7$. So the fraction in A correctly calculates the mean."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 8 [ability: below_basic]
"I hate math. 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. Just add them. $1, 4, 8, 15$. There's a 4 and a 5 in the answers. A has 5, B has 5, C has 4. Maybe it's C because there are 4 numbers if you don't count zero? Actually, I'll just guess A because it's the first one."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 9 [ability: basic]
"Mean... add them up. $0+1+3+4+7 = 15$. Divide by 5 because there are 5 numbers in the list. $15 \div 5 = 3$. 
Check A: $15 \div 5 = 3$. 
Check B: $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. That's $1+3+4+7$ is $15 \dots \div 5$ is 3. 
Check C: $15 \div 4 = 3.75$. 
A and B both give 3... but B has the 0 in it. A leaves the 0 out. The question asks for the calculation for 'the following numbers' and 0 is one of them. So B is more 'complete' because it doesn't ignore the 0."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 10 [ability: basic]
"Total is 15. Count is 5. Answer is 3. 
A is $15/5 = 3$. 
B is $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. My calculator would do the division first. So $7 \div 5$ is $1.4$, then add the others. That's not 3. 
C is $15/4 = 3.75$. 
Wait, is A right? It doesn't have the 0. If I tell someone to find the mean of $0, 1, 3, 4, 7$, can they just do $(1+3+4+7)/5$? Yes, because adding 0 does nothing to the sum. It feels a bit weird not seeing the 0 there, but the math works."
**Final Answer: A**
