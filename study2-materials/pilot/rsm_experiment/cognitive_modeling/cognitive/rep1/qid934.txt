**Student 1 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: Okay, look at the table. $x$ is 0. The formula is $4x + 2y = 10$. If $x$ is 0, then maybe I just look at the 4 and the 10? No, wait, if $x$ goes up by 1, $y$ must do something. I'll just add the 4 and the 2 together because they are next to each other, which is 6... that’s not an option. Let's look at the numbers. 10 divided by 4 is 2.5? Or maybe it's just half of 10? If $x$ is nothing, then $y$ must be the whole thing. 10? No, that's not there. I’ll guess 20 because it's the biggest number.
Answer: A

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: The table says $x = 0$. I need to find $y$. The equation is $4x + 2y = 10$. If $x = 0$, then $4 \times 0 = 0$. So that part just disappears. Now I have $2y = 10$. To get $y$ on its own, I do $10 - 2 = 8$. Wait, 8 isn't an option. Let me try again. $2y = 10$. Oh, it’s 2 times something is 10. That's 5.
Answer: C

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: This is a linear equation. To find the value under $x=0$, I substitute 0 into the equation $4(0) + 2y = 10$. $4 \times 0$ is 0, so the equation simplifies to $2y = 10$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $y = 5$. This is the y-intercept of the line.
Answer: C

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $4x + 2y = 10$. The star is under the 0. So $x=0$. That means $40 + 2y = 10$. No, that's not right, it's $4 \times 0$. $4 \times 0$ is 4. No, wait, anything times 0 is 0. So $2y = 10$. What plus 2 is 10? 8. No, it’s 2 times $y$. Half of 10 is 5.
Answer: C

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: I hate algebra. $4x + 2y = 10$. If $x$ is 0, maybe $y$ is 10? No. $4 + 2 = 6$. $10 - 6 = 4$. Not an option. What if I just divide 10 by 4? $10 \div 4$ is 2.5. That's option D. That looks like a mathy answer.
Answer: D

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: The question asks for the $y$-value when $x=0$. The equation is $4x + 2y = 10$. Substituting $x=0$ reduces the equation to $2y = 10$. Dividing by the coefficient of $y$, we get $y = 5$. If I had to fill in the rest of the table, the gradient would be $-2$ because $2y = -4x + 10 \Rightarrow y = -2x + 5$. But for $x=0$, it's definitely 5.
Answer: C

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: Plug in $x = 0$. $4(0) + 2y = 10$. $0 + 2y = 10$. So $2y = 10$. Divide by 2, $y = 5$. Easy.
Answer: C

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $4x + 2y = 10$. I'll try putting the numbers in. If $y$ is 3, $4(0) + 2(3) = 6$. That’s not 10. If $y$ is 5, $4(0) + 2(5) = 10$. Yes, that works because $4 \times 0$ is 0 and $2 \times 5$ is 10. $0 + 10 = 10$.
Answer: C

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $x$ is 0. $y$ is the star. The equation is $4, x, 2, y, 10$. I see $4, 2$, and $10$. $4+2+10 = 16$. Not there. $4 \times 2 = 8$. $10-8 = 2$. Not there. Maybe I just divide the numbers? $10 \div 4 = 2.5$. $10 \div 2 = 5$. There are two answers that could work. I'll pick 3 because it's the next number after $x=0, 1, 2...$ maybe $y$ is $5, 4, 3, 2, 1$? If $x=1$, $y=3$? Let's guess B.
Answer: B

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $x=0$ in $4x + 2y = 10$. So $2y = 10$. I need to divide 10 by 2. That's 5. Let me double check... $4 \times 0 = 0$, $2 \times 5 = 10$. $0 + 10 = 10$. Yep.
