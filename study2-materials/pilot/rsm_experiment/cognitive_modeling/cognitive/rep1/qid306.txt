"Okay, order of operations. Problem P is all addition and subtraction, which have the same priority, so I work from left to right. That means $4-5$ happens first. Problem Q has addition and multiplication. BODMAS says multiplication comes before addition, so I have to do $5 \times 6$ first. P is $4-5$ and Q is $5 \times 6$. That matches option B."
**Final answer choice: B**

**Student 2 [ability: below_basic]**
"Maths is always left to right, my primary teacher said that. So for Problem P, the first thing is $4-5$. For Problem Q, the first thing is $4+5$. It's just the order they are written in. Let's look at the options... okay, that's A."
**Final answer choice: A**

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
"Problem Q is easy, it's BIDMAS, so the multiply ($5 \times 6$) goes first. For Problem P, it's subtract and add. Some people think addition is always before subtraction because the 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, but they are actually equal, so you go left to right. So $4-5$ first. So B."
**Final answer choice: B**

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
"For P, it's $4-5+6$. Adding is usually first? No, BIDMAS... Addition, Subtraction. A comes first. So $5+6$ first? Wait, or is it $4-5$? Let's look at Q. $5 \times 6$ is definitely first because of the times sign. If Q is $5 \times 6$, the answer is B or D. If I do addition first in P, it's D. I'll go with D because A comes before S."
**Final answer choice: D**

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
"I don't like minus numbers. $4-5$ is hard. But the question just asks what to do first. $4$ and $5$ are at the start of both. So $4-5$ and $4+5$. That's A. It’s always just the first two numbers."
**Final answer choice: A**

**Student 6 [ability: proficient]**
"Problem P: Add and subtract are rank-equal, so I'll just go left to right. $4-5$ is first. Problem Q: Multiplication has higher priority than addition. So $5 \times 6$ is first. That's B."
**Final answer choice: B**

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
"BODMAS. For Q, multiplication is definitely before addition, so $5 \times 6$. For P, let's see... B-O-D-M-A-S. Addition is A, Subtraction is S. A comes first, so I should do the addition first? That's $5+6$. So P is $5+6$ and Q is $5 \times 6$. That's option D."
**Final answer choice: D**

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
"I remember the teacher saying multiplication beats addition, so Q is $5 \times 6$. For P, I'll just do it in order. $4-5$ is first. If I do it the other way I might get a weird answer. So $4-5$ and $5 \times 6$. Option B."
**Final answer choice: B**

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
"The first problem has a plus and a minus. I’ll just do the plus because plus is easier. $5+6$. For the second one, $4+5$ is at the beginning. I'll do that. Wait, the options... $5+6$ for P and $4+5$ for Q... that’s C."
**Final answer choice: C**

**Student 10 [ability: advanced]**
"Order of operations (PEMDAS/BIDMAS). In Problem P, addition and subtraction are inverse operations with equal priority; we evaluate from left to right. So, $4-5$ first. In Problem Q, multiplication takes precedence over addition. So, $5 \times 6$ first. The correct choice is B."
**Final answer choice: B**
