Okay, adding fractions. I need to look at the big numbers first. 2 plus 1 is 3. Now the fractions. 1/5 plus 2/5. The bottom numbers are both 5, so that stays the same. 1 plus 2 is 3. So it's 3 and 3/5. Let me check the options. Yeah, that's A.
**Answer: A**

**Student 2 [ability: below_basic]**
Right, fractions. I remember my teacher saying you add everything across. So, 2 plus 1 is 3. Then for the fractions: 1 plus 2 is 3 on top. Then 5 plus 5 is 10 on the bottom. So the answer is 3 and 3/10. That’s an option.
**Answer: D**

$2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5}$. I'll add the whole numbers: $2 + 1 = 3$. Then add the fractional parts: $\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$ because the denominators are already the same. Combining them gives $3 \frac{3}{5}$. The question asks for a mixed number, so A is the correct form. B is the same value but it's an improper fraction.
**Answer: A**

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
I prefer turning them into improper fractions first so I don't mess up. $2 \times 5 = 10$, plus 1 is $11/5$. Then $1 \times 5 = 5$, plus 2 is $7/5$. Now add them: $11 + 7 = 18$. So it's $18/5$. Wait, the question says "Leave your answer as a mixed number." $18 \div 5$ is 3 with 3 left over. So $3 \frac{3}{5}$.
**Answer: A**

**Student 5 [ability: advanced]**
Mental check: $2 + 1 = 3$, $1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5$. Result is $3 \frac{3}{5}$. I should double-check if any of the other options are equivalent just in case it’s a trick question. B is $18/5$, which is $3.6$, same as $3 \frac{3}{5}$, but the prompt specifically requests a mixed number. A is the only one that fits the format and the value.
**Answer: A**

**Student 6 [ability: below_basic]**
$2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5} \dots$ I hate fractions. Maybe I just multiply everything? No, that's not right. Let's see... $2+1$ is $3$. $1+2$ is $3$. $5 \dots 5$. Maybe I multiply the bottoms? $5 \times 5 = 25$? That's not there. Okay, if I just add the tops I get $18$ if I do the whole thing? No, I'll just guess. $3$ and $3/10$ looks like what you get if you just add every single number you see.
**Answer: D**

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
Since the denominators are both 5, I don't need a common denominator.
Whole numbers: $2 + 1 = 3$.
Fractions: $1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5$.
Total: $3 \frac{3}{5}$. 
Option B is also the right value, but it's an improper fraction, not a mixed number. So A.
**Answer: A**

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
$2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5}$. 
$2+1=3$. 
$1/5 + 2/5$. 
The denominators are the same, so I just add the top. 
$1+2=3$. 
So $3 \frac{3}{5}$. 
Wait, is it $3 \frac{3}{10}$? No, you don't add the bottom numbers in fractions. I think it's A. 
**Answer: A**

**Student 9 [ability: basic]**
I'll change them to decimals. $2 \frac{1}{5}$ is $2.2$. $1 \frac{2}{5}$ is $1.4$. 
$2.2 + 1.4 = 3.6$. 
Now which one of these is $3.6$? 
A) $3 \frac{3}{5}$ is $3 + 0.6 = 3.6$. 
B) $18 / 5$ is $3.6$ too. 
The question says mixed number... A is a mixed number, B is a fraction. So A.
**Answer: A**

**Student 10 [ability: below_basic]**
$2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5}$. 
The numbers are $2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 5$. 
$11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$. 
Okay, I see $18/5$ is choice B. I'll just pick that one. I forgot what a mixed number is but B is there. 
Actually, I see $18/10$ too... did I add the 5s? Maybe it's C? No, I'll stick with B.
**Answer: B**
