Okay, let's look at the first bit. $8 + 12$ is $20$. Then divide by $4$. $20 \div 4 = 5$.
Now the second bit. It has a bracket, but it's $8 + 12$ again, so that's $20$. Then divide by $4$ is $5$.
Both sides are $5$, so they are the same.
Final answer choice: **C**

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
BODMAS rules. I need to do the division first for the left side.
Left side: $12 \div 4 = 3$. Then add the $8$. $8 + 3 = 11$.
Right side: Brackets first. $8 + 12 = 20$. Then $20 \div 4 = 5$.
So it's $11$ and $5$. $11$ is bigger than $5$.
Wait, which way does the arrow point? "The crocodile eats the bigger number." So $11 > 5$.
Final answer choice: **A**

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
Left side: $8 + 12 \div 4$. Order of operations says divide before add. $12/4 = 3$, plus $8$ is $11$.
Right side: $(8 + 12) \div 4$. The parentheses override the order, so $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.
Comparing $11$ and $5$. $11$ is greater than $5$.
Therefore, $11 > 5$.
Final answer choice: **A**

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
$8 + 12 = 20 \div 4$ is $5$.
On the other side, brackets first... $8 + 12$ is $20$, $20 \div 4 = 5$.
Wait, no, BIDMAS. Division before addition.
Left: $12 \div 4$ is $3$. $8 + 3 = 11$.
Right: $(8+12)$ is $20$. $20 \div 4 = 5$.
$11$ vs $5$. $5$ is smaller. So $11 < 5$... no, $11 > 5$.
Wait, I always get the symbols backwards. $11 > 5$ is A. $11 < 5$ is B.
A is the one that points to the right. Yes.
Final answer choice: **A**

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
$8+12 \div 4...$ that's $20$ divided by $4$, which is $5$.
$(8+12) \div 4...$ that's $20$ divided by $4$, which is $5$.
They are both $5$. It's a trick question because of the brackets. The brackets don't change anything because you do the plus first anyway.
Final answer choice: **C**

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
Evaluation of the LHS: $8 + (12/4) = 8 + 3 = 11$.
Evaluation of the RHS: $(8+12)/4 = 20/4 = 5$.
Since $11 > 5$, the correct symbol is $>$.
Option A.
Final answer choice: **A**

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
LHS: Using order of operations, division comes before addition. $12 \div 4 = 3$. $8 + 3 = 11$.
RHS: Brackets first. $8 + 12 = 20$. $20 \div 4 = 5$.
$11$ is clearly greater than $5$.
Symbol is $>$.
Final answer choice: **A**

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
$8 + 12 \div 4$. If I go from left to right, it's $20 \div 4 = 5$.
But my teacher said something about PEMDAS. Divide first. $12 \div 4 = 3$. $8 + 3 = 11$.
The other side has brackets: $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$.
$11$ and $5$. $11$ is bigger.
$11 > 5$.
Final answer choice: **A**

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
$8$ plus $12$ is $20$. Divide by $4$ is $5$.
The other side is also $8$ plus $12$ is $20$. Divide by $4$ is $5$.
Is it $D$? Greater than or equal to? They are equal, so that could work.
But $C$ is just equal. I'll go with equal.
Final answer choice: **C**

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
$8 + 12 \div 4$ ... divide $12$ by $4$ first. That's $3$. Plus $8$ is $11$.
$(8 + 12) \div 4$ ... brackets first. $8+12$ is $20$. $20 \div 4$ is $5$.
$11$ is greater than $5$.
Is $11 < 5$? No, the mouth eats the bigger number. So $11 > 5$.
That is B? No, A is $>$, B is $<$.
Final answer choice: **A**
