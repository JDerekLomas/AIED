**Student 1 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: Okay, there are arrows. One is pointing at 1 and one is pointing at 4. I need to do something with them. The question says "multiply" but my teacher usually says "expand" means you add things? No, it says multiply. 1 times 4 is 4. But there are minus signs. Is it 1 plus 4? That would be 5. I’ll go with 5 because 4 is too easy. Wait, the signs... maybe they just disappear. I'll pick D because it looks like a bigger number.
Final answer: D

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Right, the arrows are pointing at the -1 and the -4. I have to multiply them. So, $1 \times 4$ is 4. Now I need to check the signs. A negative and a negative... I remember the rhyme... "two negatives make a positive." So it has to be positive 4. Let me double-check the options. A is +4. That looks right. 
Final answer: A

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: This is the 'L' in FOIL (Last terms). The first term is $2p$, the second is $-1$, then $3p$ and $-4$. The arrows are specifically pointing at $-1$ and $-4$. Multiplying two negatives gives a positive product. $1 \times 4 = 4$, so $(-1) \times (-4) = +4$.
Final answer: A

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Expand the brackets... $2p \times 3p$ is $6p^2$. Then $2p \times -4$ is $-8p$. Then $-1 \times 3p$ is $-3p$. The last bit is $-1$ and $-4$. I need to multiply them. $1 \times 4$ is 4. It's a negative and a negative, so it stays negative? No, wait. One negative makes it negative, two negatives make it positive. I think. I'll guess -4 because there are so many minus signs in the brackets.
Final answer: B

**Student 5 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: The question asks for the product of the two specific terms indicated by the arrows. The terms are the constants $-1$ and $-4$. Product of two negatives is positive. $(-1) \times (-4) = 4$. Easy marks.
Final answer: A

**Student 6 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: I don't like algebra. Arrows... $-1$ and $-4$. If I put them together it's $-1-4$. On a number line, if I'm at $-1$ and I go back 4, I get to $-5$. That's option D. Multiply? Maybe it means the total? Yeah, $-5$.
Final answer: D

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: The arrows are showing the "Last" terms of the FOIL method. We have $(-1) \times (-4)$. Negative times negative is positive. $1 \times 4 = 4$. The answer is $+4$.
Final answer: A

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Okay, arrows are on the 1 and the 4. Multiply them. $1 \times 4 = 4$. Both have minus signs. My teacher said if the signs are the same, the answer is positive. If they are different, it's negative. These are both minus, so they are the same. So it's +4. 
Final answer: A

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: The numbers are 1 and 4. The signs are minus. If I multiply 1 and 4 I get 4. There is a minus in front of the 4 and a minus in front of the 1. I'll just pick -4 because there are minuses in the question.
Final answer: B

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Arrows point to $-1$ and $-4$. $1 \times 4$ is 4. Does it become $+4$ or $-4$? I can never remember the rule. I’ll go with +4 because usually these questions want you to realize the negatives cancel out. Wait, 1 + 4 is 5. Is it C? No, it says multiply. Stick with 4. Let's go with A.
Final answer: A
