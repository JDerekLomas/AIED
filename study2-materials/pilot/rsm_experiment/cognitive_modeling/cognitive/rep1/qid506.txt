**Student 1 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: Okay, I see $3p = 1/12$. I need to get $p$ alone. Usually, you move the number to the other side. 3 is on the top, so maybe I should multiply it? $12 \times 3$ is 36. So $p = 36$. Wait, that’s not an option. Let me try $12 \div 3$. That’s 4. $p = 4$. That looks like a normal number.
Answer: C

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $3p$ means 3 times $p$. To undo times, I divide. So I need to do $(1/12) \div 3$. Dividing is hard. Maybe it's like $3/12$? $3/12$ simplifies to $1/4$ if I divide both by 3. Yeah, $1/4$ is option A. 
Answer: A

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: $3p = 1/12$. To solve for $p$, divide both sides by 3. $p = (1/12) / 3$. Dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by $1/3$. So $p = 1/12 \times 1/3$. $1 \times 1 = 1$ and $12 \times 3 = 36$. So $p = 1/36$. 
Answer: B

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $3p = 1/12$. I want $p$. If I multiply $12$ by $3$ I get 36. But the 12 is on the bottom. So it's probably $1/36$. Let me check if $1/4$ makes sense... $3 \times 1/4 = 3/4$, not $1/12$. What about $1/36$? $3 \times 1/36 = 3/36$. $3 \div 3 = 1$ and $36 \div 3 = 12$. Yes, $1/12$.
Answer: B

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: I hate fractions. $3p = 1/12$. There is a 3 and a 12. $12 / 3$ is 4. Is it 4 or $1/4$? A or C... A looks more "mathy" because of the fraction. I'll guess A.
Answer: A

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: The equation is $3p = 1/12$. Divide both sides by 3: $p = 1/(12 \times 3) = 1/36$. Simple inverse operations. 
Answer: B

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: $3p = 1/12$. If I multiply both sides by 12 to get rid of the fraction, I get $36p = 1$. Then divide by 36, so $p = 1/36$. 
Answer: B

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $3p = 1/12$. If I move the 3 over, it becomes a divide. So $1/12 \div 3$. My teacher said "keep, change, flip." Keep $1/12$, change $\div$ to $\times$, flip $3/1$ to $1/3$. $1/12 \times 1/3 = 1/36$.
Answer: B

**Student 9 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $3$ times something equals $1/12$. It has to be smaller than $1/12$ because I'm multiplying it to get there. Wait, no, that's not right. If $3 \times p = 1/12$, then $p$ must be a very small fraction. $1/4$ is bigger than $1/12$. $4$ is definitely bigger. $1/9$ doesn't seem to fit. $1/36$ is smaller than $1/12$. Let's try that. $3/36 = 1/12$. Correct.
Answer: B

**Student 10 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $3p = 1/12$. 3 goes into 12 four times. So it's 4. The answer is 4.
