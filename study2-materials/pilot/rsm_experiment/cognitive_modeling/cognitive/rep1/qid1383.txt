### Student 1 [ability: advanced]
"Okay, the formula is $T = k^4$ and $k = -3$. I need to substitute $-3$ for $k$. So it’s $(-3)^4$. This means $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$. I know that a negative number raised to an even power becomes positive. $(-3) \times (-3) = 9$. Then $9 \times (-3) = -27$, and $-27 \times (-3) = 81$. It's definitely positive 81."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 2 [ability: below_basic]
"The equation is $T = k^4$ and $k$ is $-3$. So it's $-3$ and $4$. Maybe I multiply them? $-3 \times 4 = -12$. Yeah, that’s one of the options. D is $-12$, so that looks right."
**Final Answer: D**

### Student 3 [ability: proficient]
"Substitute $k = -3$ into $k^4$. That is $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$. I'll do it in pairs: $(-3 \times -3) = 9$. And the other pair $(-3 \times -3) = 9$. So $9 \times 9 = 81$. Negative times negative is positive, so it's not C."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 4 [ability: basic]
"Alright, $k$ is $-3$. So it's $-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$. $3 \times 3$ is $9$. $9 \times 3$ is $27$. $27 \times 3 \dots$ let's see, $20 \times 3 = 60$, $7 \times 3 = 21$, so $81$. Now the sign. It’s negative, so maybe the answer stays negative? There's a minus in the question. $-3$ to the power of 4... my teacher said something about odd and even, but I think if the number starts negative, the answer usually is. I'll go with $-81$."
**Final Answer: C**

### Student 5 [ability: basic]
"T equals $k$ to the 4. $k$ is $-3$. $3^4$ is $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$. That's $9 \times 9 = 81$. Since $k$ is $-3$, I'll just put the minus back on it. $-81$."
**Final Answer: C**

### Student 6 [ability: below_basic]
"I hate powers. $k= -3$. $T = -3^4$. Is it $3+3+3+3$? No, that’s $12$. There is a minus, so maybe $-12$. Or is it $3 \times 4$? $12$. I see $12$ and $-12$. I'll guess B because I don't like the minus signs."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 7 [ability: proficient]
"$T = (-3)^4$. Since the power is even, the result must be positive. $3 \times 3 = 9$, $9 \times 3 = 27$, $27 \times 3 = 81$. Simple enough."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 8 [ability: basic]
"Substitute $-3$ for $k$. So $-3^4$. On my calculator earlier today, I remember if I type $-3^4$ it says $-81$, but if I use brackets it’s $81$. Which one is it? The question says $k$ is the whole number $-3$, so it should be brackets. But I'm not sure. Let me look at the choices. $81$ and $-81$ are both there. I'll go with $-81$ because the negative is there in the question."
**Final Answer: C**

### Student 9 [ability: below_basic]
"$T=k^4$. $k$ is $-3$. This is too hard. Maybe I just add them? $-3+4 = 1$. Not an option. Multiply? $-3 \times 4 = -12$. Okay, that's D. I'll just pick that and move on."
**Final Answer: D**

### Student 10 [ability: advanced]
"Substitution: $T = (-3)^4$. An even exponent always results in a non-negative value when the base is a real number. $3^4 = 81$. Therefore, $(-3)^4 = 81$."
**Final Answer: A**
