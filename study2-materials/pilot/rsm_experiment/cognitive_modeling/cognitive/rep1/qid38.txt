### Student 1 [ability: basic]
"Okay, fractions. I remember I need a common denominator. The first one is $2x$ and the second one is $x$. If I just add the top numbers, 3 plus 4 is 7. If I add the bottom numbers, $2x$ plus $x$ is $3x$. So $7$ over $3x$. That looks like one of the options. Yeah, option B sounds right."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 2 [ability: below_basic]
"Adding fractions... 3 plus 4 is 7. The bottom has $x$ and $2x$. This is confusing. Maybe I just pick the one that looks like it has all the numbers? There's a 7 and a 2 and an $x$. Let's go with D because 7 is 3+4 and $2x$ is the bigger bottom part."
**Final Answer: D**

### Student 3 [ability: proficient]
"I need the denominators to be the same. The first is $2x$, the second is $x$. I can turn $x$ into $2x$ by multiplying the top and bottom by 2. So, $4/x$ becomes $8/2x$. Now I have $3/2x + 8/2x$. Adding the numerators gives $3 + 8 = 11$. The denominator stays $2x$. So it's $11/2x$."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 4 [ability: basic]
"Common denominator... let's see. If I multiply the first fraction by $x$ and the second by $2x$? No, that's too big. Wait, if I just make them both $2x$. The first one is already $3/2x$. The second one is $4/x$. To get $2x$ on the bottom, I multiply by 2. Do I multiply the top by 2 as well? Yes. $4 \times 2 = 8$. So $3 + 8$ is 11. The bottom is... $2x$ plus $2x$ is $4x$? No, the denominator stays the same in fractions. So $11/2x$."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 5 [ability: below_basic]
"3/2x + 4/x. There's an $x$ in both. Can I just cancel them? If I ignore the $x$, it's 3/2 + 4. 4 is like 8/2. So 3/2 + 8/2 is 11/2. Now put the $x$ back... $11/2x$. Oh, that's option A. I hope that's how it works."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 6 [ability: advanced]
"Finding the LCD for $3/(2x)$ and $4/x$. The LCD is $2x$. I need to scale the second fraction by $2/2$. So, $4/x \cdot 2/2 = 8/(2x)$. Then $3/(2x) + 8/(2x) = (3+8)/(2x) = 11/(2x)$. Simplest form, no common factors. Choice A."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 7 [ability: proficient]
"To add these, I'll use the 'cross-multiply' method for the top. $(3 \times x) + (4 \times 2x)$ over $(2x \times x)$. That gives me $3x + 8x$ on top, which is $11x$. On the bottom, $2x^2$. So $11x / 2x^2$. I can cancel one $x$ from the top and bottom. That leaves $11 / 2x$. Done."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 8 [ability: basic]
"Denominator needs to be the same. The first one has a 2, the second doesn't. So I'll just add 2 to the bottom of the second one? No, you have to multiply. $4/x$ times 2 is $8/2x$. Now add them: $3+8=11$. And $2x+x$ is... wait, is it $11/3x$ or $11/2x$? I think the bottom stays $2x$. I'll pick A."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 9 [ability: below_basic]
"3 over 2x plus 4 over x. 3 plus 4 is 7. The $x$ is everywhere so it's probably just $7/x$. Let me check the answers. $7/x$ isn't there, but $11/x$ is. Maybe I missed something? Let's just go with C, it's the simplest looking one with the 11 I keep seeing in my head."
**Final Answer: C**

### Student 10 [ability: basic]
"I hate fractions. $3/2x + 4/x$. If I make $x$ a number, like 1... then it's $3/2 + 4/1$. $1.5 + 4 = 5.5$. Which answer gives 5.5 if $x$ is 1? A) $11/2$ is 5.5. B) $7/3$ is 2.33. C) $11/1$ is 11. D) $7/2$ is 3.5. So it must be A."
**Final Answer: A**
