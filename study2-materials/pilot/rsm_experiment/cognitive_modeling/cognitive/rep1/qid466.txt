"Okay, there's a negative 3/4 and the answer is negative 1. I remember my teacher saying that if you have a fraction and you want it to be 1, you just use the same fraction. But it’s already negative, and the answer stays negative. So maybe I just need the same number? Let's look at the options. 3/4 is there. If I do 3/4 times 3/4... wait, that's 9/16. That's not 1. Maybe it's just the same number to keep it the same? I'll guess D because it looks the same as the start."
**Answer: D**

"We have $-3/4 \times x = -1$. I need to isolate the star. To get rid of the $-3/4$, I should divide both sides by $-3/4$. So, $x = -1 \div (-3/4)$. When you divide by a fraction, you multiply by its reciprocal. So that is $-1 \times (-4/3)$. A negative times a negative is a positive. $1 \times 4/3$ is $4/3$. Checking: $-3/4 \times 4/3 = -12/12 = -1$. Correct."
**Answer: A**

"To get 1 from a fraction, you have to flip it. So 3/4 becomes 4/3. Now I need to check the signs. The answer is $-1$. If I have a negative number $(-3/4)$ and I multiply it by a positive number $(4/3)$, the answer is negative. If I multiplied it by a negative, it would become positive. Since I want it to stay negative, the star must be positive. So it's 4/3."
**Answer: A**

"I remember something about 'keep-change-flip' but that’s for division. This is multiplication. I need the numbers to cancel out to make 1. So 3 on top cancels with 3 on bottom, 4 on bottom cancels with 4 on top. That means the star is 4/3. Now, the sign... the question has two minus signs. Wait, there's a minus in the question and a minus in the answer. Usually, two minuses make a plus? Or maybe I need another minus to keep it negative? I think I'll go with -4/3 because there's already two minuses in the equation."
**Answer: B**

"Fraction multiplication is hard. $-3/4$ times something equals $-1$. $-1$ is like $-4/4$. How do I get from 3 to 4? You add 1? No, this is multiplication. Maybe I just pick the one that looks like it completes the set. 3/4 is there, so 4/3 must be it. I'll go with C because it's the positive version of the fraction."
**Answer: C**

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
"This is asking for the multiplicative inverse, but we need to maintain the negative sign in the product. We know $a \times (1/a) = 1$. Here, $(-3/4) \times (\text{star}) = -1$. If I multiply by the reciprocal $4/3$, I get $(-3/4) \times (4/3) = -12/12 = -1$. If I chose $-4/3$, the negatives would cancel to positive 1. Therefore, the answer must be positive 4/3."
**Answer: A**

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
"Okay, $-3/4$ times star is $-1$. To make 1, I need 4/3. If I use $-4/3$, then $(-3/4) \times (-4/3) = 12/12 = 1$. But the question says the answer is $-1$. So the star can't be negative. It has to be the positive one. That's A."
**Answer: A**

**Student 8 [ability: proficient]**
"Let $x$ be the star. $-0.75x = -1$. $x = -1 / -0.75$. The answer will be positive because a negative divided by a negative is positive. $1 / 0.75$ is $1 / (3/4)$, which is $4/3$. Looking at the options, A is $4/3$ and B is $-4/3$. It's definitely A."
**Answer: A**

"I hate fractions. -3/4... the 1 is negative too. Does that mean they cancel out? If I just take away the 3/4 I'm left with nothing? Maybe it's D because the question has -3/4 in it and usually these questions are trick questions where the answer is the same as the number."
**Answer: D**

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
"$-3/4$ times what equals $-1$. To get 1, I flip the fraction to 4/3. Now I check the minus. If I do $- \times -$, I get $+$. If I do $- \times +$, I get $-$. I want the answer to be $-1$, which is negative. So I need a negative and a positive. The first number is negative, so the second number (star) must be positive. So 4/3."
