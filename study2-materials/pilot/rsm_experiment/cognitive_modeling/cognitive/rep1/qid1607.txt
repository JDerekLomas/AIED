"Okay, let's look at Isaac's work. Equation is $15 = \frac{1+k}{4}$. To get rid of the fraction, you multiply both sides by 4. $15 \times 4$ is 60, and the right side becomes $1+k$. So Step 1 is $60 = 1+k$. That is correct. Now Step 2: to solve for $k$, I need to subtract 1 from both sides. $60 - 1 = 59$. Isaac added 1 instead to get 61. So Step 1 is right, but Step 2 is definitely wrong."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
"I hate fractions. Isaac multiplied 15 by 4 to get 60. That sounds right because the 4 is on the bottom. So $60 = 1+k$. Now, he has $61=k$. If $60 = 1+k$, then $k$ must be 61? Wait, $1+61$ is 62, not 60. He should have done 59. So Step 1 worked but Step 2 is a mistake."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 3 [ability: below_basic]**
"Fifteen equals one plus k over four. Step 1 says 60. How did he get 60? Maybe $15 \times 4$? Yeah, that's 60. So that looks fine. Step 2 is $61=k$. He probably just moved the 1 over. $60+1$ is 61. That looks like normal math steps to me. Both look okay."
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 4 [ability: proficient]**
"Let's solve it myself first. $15 = (1+k)/4$. Multiply by 4: $60 = 1+k$. Subtract 1: $k = 59$. Checking Isaac’s steps: His Step 1 is $60 = 1+k$. That matches mine. His Step 2 is $61 = k$. Mine was 59. He added 1 instead of subtracting it. Only Step 1 is correct."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
"I don't know how to do the fraction ones. Is it $15 \times 4$? 15, 30, 45, 60. Okay, so 60 is there. But then it's $1+k$. If you have 60 and 1, you get 61. Both steps use the numbers in the equation, so he's probably doing it right. I'll guess C."
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 6 [ability: basic]**
"Step 1: $15 \times 4 = 60$. Correct. Step 2: He has $60 = 1+k$. To get $k$ alone, you do the opposite of $+1$, which is $-1$. $60 - 1$ is 59. He wrote 61. He forgot to flip the sign when moving the 1 across the equals sign. So only Step 1 is right."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
"Equation: $15 = \frac{1+k}{4}$. Isaac multiplied by 4 first. $15 \times 4 = 60$. Right side becomes $1+k$. Correct. Next, he should subtract 1 from 60 to isolate $k$. $k$ should be 59. He has 61. He did $60+1$ instead of $60-1$. So only Step 1."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
"Wait, $1+k$ divided by 4... If $k$ is 61, then $1+61=62$. $62/4$ is... 15.5. That's not 15. If $k$ is 59, $1+59=60$, $60/4=15$. So $k=59$ is the answer. Isaac's Step 2 says $k=61$, so Step 2 is wrong. Is Step 1 right? $60 = 1+59$ is $60=60$. Yes, Step 1 is the right path."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
"I'll try to put the numbers in. $15 \times 4$ is 60. That's Step 1. Then $60+1$ is 61. That's Step 2. It looks like a pattern. $15 \dots 4 \dots 1$. Multiply then add. That's usually how these work. I'll go with C."
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 10 [ability: advanced]**
"Solving $15 = \frac{k+1}{4}$. Inverse of divide by 4 is multiply by 4: $60 = k+1$. This is Isaac's Step 1. Correct. Inverse of add 1 is subtract 1: $k = 59$. Isaac's Step 2 says $k=61$. He mistakenly added 1 to 60. Therefore, only Step 1 is correct."
