### Student 1 [ability: advanced]
"Okay, order of operations. BIDMAS. Multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. So, first step is $4 \times 2$, which is $8$. Now the expression is $3 - 5 + 8$. Now I just go left to right. $3 - 5$ is $-2$. Then $-2 + 8$ is $6$. Easy."
**Answer: A**

### Student 2 [ability: below_basic]
"Right, math. Three take away five... you can't really do that, but if you do it's like two? No, minus two. Then plus four. $-2 + 4$ is $2$. Then $2 \times 2$. That's $4$. Yeah, just go straight across. $3$ minus $5$ is $-2$, plus $4$ is $2$, times $2$ is $4$."
**Answer: B**

### Student 3 [ability: basic]
"BODMAS. Brackets... none. Orders... none. Division... none. Multiplication... yes. $4 \times 2 = 8$. Now I have $3 - 5 + 8$. Okay, addition comes before subtraction in BODMAS. So $5 + 8 = 13$. Now I have $3 - 13$. That is $-10$."
*(Note: Student erroneously grouped the subtraction sign as separate from the 5)*
**Answer: D**

### Student 4 [ability: proficient]
"Need to use PEMDAS. Multiply first: $4 \times 2 = 8$. The equation is now $3 - 5 + 8$. Addition and subtraction have the same priority, so I just work from left to right. $3 - 5 = -2$. Then $-2 + 8 = 6$."
**Answer: A**

### Student 5 [ability: basic]
"Okay, $3 - 5$ is $-2$. Then I have $+ 4 \times 2$. You have to do the times first. $4 \times 2$ is $8$. So it's $-2 + 8$. If I'm at negative two on the number line and go up eight... seven, six, five... no, $-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$. It's $6$."
**Answer: A**

### Student 6 [ability: below_basic]
"3 minus 5 is negative 2. Negative 2 plus 4 is 2. 2 times 2 is 4. Wait, my teacher said something about doing the end first? $4 \times 2$ is $8$. Then $5 + 8$ is $13$. Then $3 - 13$ is $-10$. I'll go with $-10$, it looks more like a high school answer."
**Answer: D**

### Student 7 [ability: basic]
"I remember BIDMAS. Multiply first. $4 \times 2 = 8$. Now the question is $3 - 5 + 8$. Addition comes next. $5 + 8$ is $13$. So $3$ minus $13$ is negative $10$. I always get confused if the minus stays there or not, but 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym."
**Answer: D**

### Student 8 [ability: below_basic]
"$3 - 5 + 4$ is... $3-5$ is $-2$. $-2 + 4$ is $2$. $2 \times 2$ is $4$. I don't remember the rules. Let's try $5 + 4$ is $9$. $9 \times 2$ is $18$. $3 - 18$ is $-15$. That’s not an option. Okay, I’ll just go from left to right. $3-5=-2$. $-2+4=2$. $2 \times 2 = 4$. That’s B."
**Answer: B**

### Student 9 [ability: proficient]
"Standard order of operations. Do the multiplication: $4 \times 2 = 8$. Rewrite: $3 - 5 + 8$. Add/Subtract left to right. $3 - 5 = -2$. $-2 + 8 = 6$. It’s A. A common mistake is doing $5+8$ first, which gives $-10$, but they are equal rank."
**Answer: A**

### Student 10 [ability: advanced]
"Expression: $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$. Term 1: $3$. Term 2: $-5$. Term 3: $4 \times 2 = 8$. Summing the terms: $3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = 6$."
