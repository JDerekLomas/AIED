"Okay, I need to find the star. The star is next to $x$, and $y$ is 0.5. So I put 0.5 where the $y$ is in the equation. $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$. Half of 6 is 3. So $10x - 3 = 30$. Now I add 3 to both sides. $10x = 33$. To get $x$, I divide 33 by 10. That's 3.3. Let me check the options. Yes, C is 3.3."
**Answer: C**

**Student 2 [ability: below_basic]**
"The equation is $10x - 6y = 30$. $y$ is $0.5$. Maybe I just add $10$ and $6$? No. Let's try putting the $0.5$ in. $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$. $10$ times $0.5$ is $5$. $5 - 6y = 30$. This looks hard. If $x$ is $0.5$, then $y$ must be... wait, the table says $y$ is $0.5$. I mixed them up. Let's restart. $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$. $10x - 6.5 = 30$. So $10x = 36.5$. $x = 3.65$. That’s not an option. I'll just guess A because it has a $.25$ and $0.5$ is like quarters."
**Answer: A**

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
"Substituting $y = 0.5$ into $10x - 6y = 30$.
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 33 / 10 = 3.3$.
Checking my signs... yes, it was $-6y$, and $y$ is positive, so it stays negative. Adding 3 to both sides is correct. $3.3$ is option C."
**Answer: C**

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
"10 times something minus 6 times 0.5 equals 30.
6 times 0.5 is 3.
So $10x - 3 = 30$.
Wait, if it's minus 3, maybe I subtract 3? $10x = 27$.
Then $x = 2.7$.
Let me look at the choices. 2.7 is D. That seems right."
**Answer: D**

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
"I hate algebra. $10x - 6y = 30$. $y$ is $0.5$. 
$10 - 6 = 4$. $4 + 0.5 = 4.5$. 
None of the answers are $4.5$. 
$4.25$ is close to $4.5$. I'll go with A."
**Answer: A**

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
"The equation is a linear relation. I'll substitute $y = 1/2$.
$10x - 6(1/2) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$.
Simple enough. I'll just double-check the arithmetic. $10(3.3) = 33$. $6(0.5) = 3$. $33 - 3 = 30$. Correct."
**Answer: C**

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
"Table shows $y = 0.5$. Equation is $10x - 6y = 30$.
Substitute: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$.
$10x - 3 = 30$.
Add 3 to both sides: $10x = 33$.
Divide by 10: $x = 3.3$.
Option C matches."
**Answer: C**

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
"If $y = 0.5$, then $6 \times 0.5 = 3$.
So $10x - 3 = 30$.
I'll try the answers to see which one works.
If $x$ is 3.3, then $10 \times 3.3 = 33$.
$33 - 3 = 30$.
Yes, that works! Option C."
**Answer: C**

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
"I remember doing this. You move the 10 over?
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$.
$6 \times 0.5$ is $3$.
$10x = 30 - 3$. 
$10x = 27$.
$x = 2.7$. 
Wait, is it plus or minus? $10x - 3 = 30$. 
Maybe I just add them all? $30 + 10 + 6 \times 0.5 = 43$. 
$4.3$ isn't there. $4.25$ is the biggest one, I'll pick A."
**Answer: A**

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
"$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 33/10$.
Is that 3.3? Yeah, moving the decimal one place.
I hope I didn't mess up the minus sign. If it was $10x + 3 = 30$, it would be 2.7. 
But the equation says $-6y$. So it's 3.3."
