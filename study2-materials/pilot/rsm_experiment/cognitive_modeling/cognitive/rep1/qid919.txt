Okay, the equation is $y = 3x^2$. The $x$ value is $0.3$. So I need to do 3 times $0.3$, then square it? No, BIDMAS says I square it first. So $0.3 \times 0.3$. $3 \times 3$ is 9. Because there are two decimal places, it must be $0.09$. Now I do $3 \times 0.09$. $3 \times 9$ is 27. So $0.27$. Let me check the options. Yes, that's B.
Final answer: B

**Student 2 [ability: below_basic]**
$y = 3x^2$ and $x = 0.3$. I’ll just put the $0.3$ where the $x$ is. So $3 \times 0.3$ is $0.9$. Then there is a little 2, so $0.9 \times 2 = 1.8$. That's choice C.
Final answer: C

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
Substitution: $y = 3(0.3)^2$. 
First, square the $0.3$. $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$.
Next, multiply by 3. $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. 
Wait, let me double check my decimals. $0.3$ has one decimal place, so the square has two. $0.09$ is correct. $3 \times 9 = 27$, move it back two places... $0.27$. Matches B.
Final answer: B

$3x^2$... okay, $x$ is $0.3$. 
$0.3$ squared is $0.9$. 
Then $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$. 
Wait, $0.3 \times 0.3$... is it $0.9$ or $0.09$? 
I think it's $0.9$. $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$. That's option D.
Final answer: D

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
I hate decimals. $3x^2$ with $x = 0.3$. 
Maybe it's $(3 \times 0.3)^2$? 
$3 \times 0.3$ is $0.9$. 
$0.9 \times 0.9$... $9 \times 9$ is 81. 
So it must be $0.81$. That is option A.
Final answer: A

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
Equation: $y = 3x^2$. Given $x = 3 \cdot 10^{-1}$.
$x^2 = (3 \cdot 10^{-1})^2 = 9 \cdot 10^{-2} = 0.09$.
$y = 3 \cdot 0.09 = 0.27$.
Straightforward substitution and order of operations.
Final answer: B

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
$x = 0.3$. $y = 3x^2$.
So $y = 3 \times 0.3 \times 0.3$.
$3 \times 0.3$ is $0.9$.
$0.9 \times 0.3$... $9 \times 3$ is 27. 
There is one decimal in $0.9$ and one in $0.3$, so I need two in the answer.
$0.27$.
Final answer: B

**Student 8 [ability: below_basic]**
$y = 3$ and then $x$ is $0.3$.
Maybe you just put them together? $3.3^2$? No, that’s not right.
$3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$.
The square thing usually means it's bigger. 1.8 is bigger. 
Actually, I'll just guess D because 2.7 looks like it has a 3 and a 9 in it.
Final answer: D

**Student 9 [ability: proficient]**
$x = 0.3$
$y = 3(0.3)^2$
Indices first: $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$.
Multiply: $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.
Double checking if I should have multiplied 3 and 0.3 first. No, brackets/indices come before multiplication in BIDMAS. If it were $(3x)^2$ the answer would be $0.81$, but the square is only on the $x$.
Final answer: B

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
$y = 3 \times 0.3^2$.
$0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$.
$3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$.
Choice C.
Final answer: C
