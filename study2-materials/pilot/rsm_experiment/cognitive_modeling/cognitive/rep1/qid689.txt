"Okay, it’s an equation with a $p$ at the bottom. I hate fractions. Maybe I just multiply the numbers? $10 \times 5$ is $50$. That’s option B. Let me check if that makes sense... $5$ divided by $50$... that’s a small number, not $10$. But $50$ is right there in the options and I usually multiply in these questions."
**Final Answer: B**

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
"Ten equals five over $p$. I need to get $p$ by itself. If I move the $5$ to the other side, it becomes $10$ divided by $5$. $10 \div 5 = 2$. So $p = 2$."
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
"We have $10 = 5/p$. I need to get $p$ out of the denominator, so I'll multiply both sides by $p$. That gives me $10p = 5$. Now, to solve for $p$, I divide by $10$. So $p = 5/10$. That’s a half, or $0.5$. Let me double check... $5$ divided by $0.5$ is the same as $5 \times 2$, which is $10$. Correct."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
"I remember a trick for this where you can just swap the $10$ and the $p$ if the $p$ is on the bottom. So $p = 10 / 5$. $10 \div 5$ is $2$. Let's go with C."
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
"If $10 = 5$ divided by $p$, then $p$ has to be something that goes into $5$ to make it bigger? Wait, no. $5$ divided by anything smaller than itself makes it smaller. Or is it bigger? I don't know. Let's try $p = 2$. $5 \div 2$ is $2.5$. That’s not $10$. Let’s try $p = 50$. $5 \div 50$ is $0.1$. Not $10$. There are no solutions because $10$ is bigger than $5$, so dividing $5$ can't make it $10$."
**Final Answer: D**

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
"Equation is $10 = 5/p$. Recognize this as a basic reciprocal relationship. Multiplying by $p$ yields $10p = 5$. Dividing by $10$ yields $p = 0.5$. Quickly verifying: $5 / (1/2) = 10$. Yes, choice A."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
"Is it $10 \times 5$ or $10 \div 5$? Most of the time it’s $10 \div 5$. That's $2$. If I put $2$ in the equation, it’s $10 = 5/2$. $5/2$ is $2.5$. That doesn't work. Maybe it's $5 \div 10$? $5$ divided by $10$ is $0.5$. Let me check that. $5 \div 0.5$... how many halves in five? Ten. Okay, so $0.5$ works."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 8 [ability: below_basic]**
"I see $10$ and $5$. If I add them I get $15$, not an option. If I subtract them I get $5$. If I multiply them I get $50$. $50$ is an option, so I'll pick B."
**Final Answer: B**

**Student 9 [ability: proficient]**
"The variable is in the denominator. Multiply by $p$ to get $10p = 5$. Divide by $10$ to isolate $p$. $p = 5/10 = 1/2 = 0.5$. Standard."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
"If $10 = 5 / p$, I'll just guess and check. 
If $p = 0.5$, $5 / 0.5 = 10$. (A)
If $p = 50$, $5 / 50 = 0.1$. (B)
If $p = 2$, $5 / 2 = 2.5$. (C)
It's A."
