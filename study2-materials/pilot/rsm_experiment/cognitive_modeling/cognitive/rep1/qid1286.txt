Thinking: Okay, volume of a sphere. I remember circles have $\pi$ and $r$. The question has $V$ and wants $r$. I don't remember the formula for volume, maybe it's $4/3 \pi r^2$? No, volume is usually cubed. All the answers have a cube root thing, so that doesn't help. Let me look at the options. D looks different from the others, maybe that's it? Actually, A has $4 V \pi$ all on top. That looks like a big number, so maybe that's it. I'll just pick A because it has all the bits.
**Answer: A**

**Student 2 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: The formula for the volume of a sphere is $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$. I need to rearrange this to solve for $r$.
Step 1: Multiply both sides by 3: $3V = 4 \pi r^3$.
Step 2: Divide both sides by $4 \pi$: $\frac{3V}{4 \pi} = r^3$.
Step 3: Take the cube root of both sides: $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4 \pi}}$.
This matches option C exactly.
**Answer: C**

**Student 3 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $V = 4/3 \pi r^3$. I need $r$ by itself. I'll move the $4/3$ first. To move a fraction, I flip it? So it's $3/4 V = \pi r^3$. Now move the $\pi$. Since it's multiplying, I divide. So $3V$ divided by $4$ and also divided by $\pi$. That gives me $r^3 = 3V / 4\pi$. To get $r$, I need the opposite of power of 3, which is a cube root. So $\sqrt[3]{3V / 4\pi}$. Let me look at the list. C matches.
**Answer: C**

**Student 4 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: Rearranging $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$. 
$V / (4/3 \pi) = r^3$.
Dividing by $4/3$ is the same as multiplying by $0.75$... no, $1.33$. Wait, just use the reciprocal. 
$r^3 = V \times \frac{3}{4\pi}$. 
$r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$. 
Taking the cube root: $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$. 
Easy enough, that's C. 
**Answer: C**

**Student 5 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Volume equals 4/3 pi r cubed. I'll write it down: $V = \frac{4 \pi r^3}{3}$. 
To get $r$ alone, I have to get rid of the 3 and the 4 and the pi.
If I move the 4 and the pi over, they stay on the top? 
$V \times 4 \times \pi / 3 = r^3$? 
No, that's if they were on the bottom. 
If they are on the top, they go to the bottom. 
So $r^3 = \frac{3 \times V}{4 \times \pi}$. 
Wait, looking at A... no, looking at B... B has $4V$ on top. 
Looking at C, it has $3V$ on top. 
If $V = 4/3 \dots$ then $3V$ should be on top.
**Answer: C**

**Student 6 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: Radius... that's the line in the middle. Volume is the whole thing. The formula is $V = \text{area} \times \text{height}$? No, it’s a sphere. I think it has $4/3$ in it. All the answers have $3$ and $4$. I’ll pick D because it has the square root symbol but with a 3, and I like how it looks separate. 
**Answer: D**

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: I remember $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$.
If I want $r$, I do $V$ divided by $4/3 \pi$.
$V \div \frac{4\pi}{3}$.
To divide by a fraction, you flip and multiply.
$V \times \frac{3}{4\pi}$.
So $r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$.
Now cube root it. $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$. 
Matches C.
**Answer: C**

**Student 8 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$.
Isolate $r^3$: $r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$.
So $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$.
Looking at the options:
A is $4V\pi/3$ (Wrong numerator/denominator).
B is $4V/3\pi$ (Inverted the fraction).
C is $3V/4\pi$ (Correct).
D is $3\sqrt[3]{V}/4\pi$ (The $3/4\pi$ is outside the root, that's wrong).
Final check, C is definitely it.
**Answer: C**

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $V$ is for Volume. The picture has a question mark for radius. Radius is $r$. 
Maybe I just multiply $V$ by the numbers I remember from the sphere. $4, 3, \pi$. 
Option B has $4V$ on top. $4$ is the main number for spheres. $4$ should probably be on top. Let's go with B.
**Answer: B**

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Okay, formula is $V = 4/3 \pi r^3$. 
I need to get $r$ by itself. 
I'll move the $\pi$ first. $V/\pi = 4/3 r^3$. 
Now move the 4/3. $4/3$ becomes $3/4$ on the other side? 
$\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$. 
Then I need to find the one with $\frac{3V}{4\pi}$ inside the cube root.
Wait, let me double check B. B is $\frac{4V}{3\pi}$. 
Is it $3V/4$ or $4V/3$? 
$V$ is $4/3 \dots$ so $1 \times V = 4/3 \dots$ 
To get $1$ on the $r$ side, I multiply by $3$ and divide by $4$.
Yes, $3$ goes with $V$. 
Answer C.
