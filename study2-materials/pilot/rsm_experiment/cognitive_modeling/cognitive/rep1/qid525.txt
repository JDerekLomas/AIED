**Student 1 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: Okay, adding fractions. First, I see the big numbers. $2 + 2$ is $4$. Now I just need to add the fractions. Top plus top: $7 + 1 = 8$. Bottom plus bottom: $10 + 4 = 14$. So that makes $4 \frac{8}{14}$. That’s one of the options, so I must be right. I hate fractions, but that was actually easy.
**Final Answer: D**

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Mixed numbers... I should turn them into improper fractions first because that's what my teacher said. $2 \times 10 + 7 = 27/10$. And $2 \times 4 + 1 = 9/4$. Now I need a common denominator. 10 and 4... let’s use 40. $27 \times 4$ is... $27, 54, 108$. So $108/40$. $9 \times 10$ is $90$. So $90/40$. $108 + 90 = 198$. So $198/40$. Looking at the answers... none of them match. Wait, A and C are improper. A is $99/20$. If I divide $198/40$ by 2... $198 \div 2 = 99$ and $40 \div 2 = 20$. So $99/20$. The question asks for a mixed number though... but B is $4 \frac{19}{20}$. Is $99/20$ the same? $20, 40, 60, 80$. That’s $4$ with $19$ left over. Oh! It is. I’ll go with B.
**Final Answer: B**

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: $2 \frac{7}{10} + 2 \frac{1}{4}$. I’ll add the whole numbers first: $2 + 2 = 4$. Now the fractions: $7/10 + 1/4$. Lowest common multiple of 10 and 4 is 20. $7/10 = 14/20$. $1/4 = 5/20$. $14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20$. Put it together with the 4: $4 \frac{19}{20}$. Check the options. B is exactly that. Simple.
**Final Answer: B**

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: I remember you add the big numbers. $2 + 2 = 4$. Then you do the cross-multiply thing? $7 \times 4 = 28$ and $1 \times 10 = 10$. Add them together is 38. Then $10 \times 4 = 40$. So $4 \frac{38}{40}$. Let me simplify $38/40$. Half of 38 is 19. Half of 40 is 20. So $4 \frac{19}{20}$. Yes, that’s B.
**Final Answer: B**

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $2 \frac{7}{10}$ is nearly 3. $2 \frac{1}{4}$ is a bit more than 2. So the answer should be around 5. A is $99/20$... how many 20s in 99? About 5. B is $4$ and something... also nearly 5. D is $4$ and $8/14$, which is about $4$ and a half. C is $99/40$... that's only like 2 something. That's too small. I'll guess A because the improper fraction looks more like the hard math we did yesterday.
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: $2.7 + 2.25 = 4.95$.
Converting the options to decimals: 
A) $99/20 = 4.95$
B) $4 \frac{19}{20} = 4 + 0.95 = 4.95$
Wait, the question asks to "Leave your answer as a mixed number." Even though A is numerically correct, it is an improper fraction, not a mixed number. B is the mixed number version. D is the result of the common error of adding numerators and denominators. C is a distraction.
**Final Answer: B**

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $2 \times 10 = 20, + 7 = 27/10$.
$2 \times 4 = 8, + 1 = 9/4$.
Common denominator 20. 
$27 \times 2 = 54$. 
$9 \times 5 = 45$. 
$54 + 45 = 99$.
So $99/20$. 
Wait, the options are A or B... A is $99/20$. B is $4 \frac{19}{20}$.
$20 \times 4 = 80$. $99 - 80 = 19$. So $4 \frac{19}{20}$. 
The question says leave it as a mixed number. A is not a mixed number. B is.
**Final Answer: B**

**Student 8 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $2 + 2 = 4$. $7/10 + 1/4$. $7+1$ is 8. $10+4$ is 14. $4 \frac{8}{14}$. Oh, wait, I can simplify that. $4 \frac{4}{7}$. Is that an option? No. But $4 \frac{8}{14}$ is D. I'll just pick that. It's the only one that uses the numbers from the fractions.
**Final Answer: D**

**Student 9 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: $2.7 + 2.25$.
$0.7 + 0.25 = 0.95$. 
$2 + 2 = 4$. 
$4.95$ total. 
$0.95$ as a fraction is $95/100$. 
Divide both by 5... $19/20$. 
So $4 \frac{19}{20}$. 
Answer B.
**Final Answer: B**

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $2 \frac{7}{10} + 2 \frac{1}{4} = 4 \frac{?}{?}$. 
Common denominator 40.
$7/10 = 28/40$.
$1/4 = 10/40$.
$28 + 10 = 38$.
$4 \frac{38}{40}$.
Simplify: $4 \frac{19}{20}$.
Matches B. (I almost picked A because I calculated $99/20$ on my scrap paper first, but the question says mixed number).
**Final Answer: B**
