Reasoning: I need to isolate the star. The equation is $( -3/4 ) \times \star = -1$. To solve for $\star$, I divide both sides by $-3/4$. That’s the same as multiplying by the reciprocal: $\star = -1 \times (-4/3)$. A negative times a negative is a positive, and $1 \times 4/3$ is $4/3$. Alternatively, I know that a number times its reciprocal equals $1$, so $(-3/4) \times (-4/3) = 1$. Since I need it to equal $-1$, one of the signs must be different... wait, let me re-check. $(-3/4) \times (4/3) = -12/12 = -1$. Yes, the signs need to be different to result in a negative. Since $-3/4$ is already negative, the star must be positive.
Final answer: A

**Student 2 [ability: below_basic]**
Reasoning: Okay, I see $-3/4$ and $-1$. The star is probably just the same number but positive to make the minus sign go away? Or maybe it's just the same number again. If I put $-3/4$ in there, it looks like it matches the other side. Let me look at the options. There is a $3/4$ and a $-3/4$. I’ll pick the negative one because there are more minus signs in the question.
Final answer: D

Reasoning: The equation is $-3/4 \times \star = -1$. If I multiply a fraction by its flip, I get $1$. So $3/4 \times 4/3 = 1$. Now I just need to check the signs. We have $(- \text{something}) \times (\text{star}) = -1$. For the answer to stay negative, the star has to be positive. So it must be $+4/3$. 
Final answer: A

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
Reasoning: Multiplication... okay. I need to get to $1$. Fractions are hard. To get $1$, you usually have the same number on top and bottom. If I use $4/3$, then $3 \times 4$ is $12$ and $4 \times 3$ is $12$. $12/12$ is $1$. I have a minus sign at the start and a minus sign at the end. If I pick B, which is $-4/3$, then two minuses make a plus. So $(-3/4) \times (-4/3)$ would be $+1$. But the question says $-1$. So it has to be the positive one, $4/3$.
Final answer: A

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
Reasoning: I hate fractions. $-3/4$ times something is $-1$. Is it subtraction? No, it's times. Maybe I just add $1/4$ to get to $1$? No, that’s not an option. All the options are $3/4$ or $4/3$. I'll just guess the one that looks like the inverse? $4/3$ sounds familiar. I'll go with the negative one because the answer is negative.
Final answer: B

**Student 6 [ability: basic]**
Reasoning: To get $1$, you flip the fraction. So it's either A or B. Now, the signs... if I do a negative times a negative, it becomes a positive. The answer is $-1$, which is negative. That means I need one negative and one positive. The first number is negative, so the star must be positive. Wait, let me check that. $-3/4 \times 4/3 = -12/12 = -1$. Yeah, that works.
Final answer: A

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
Reasoning: Let $x$ be the star. $(-3/4)x = -1$. Multiply both sides by $-4$ to get rid of the denominator: $3x = 4$. Then divide by $3$: $x = 4/3$. Double check: $(-3/4) \times (4/3) = -12/12 = -1$. Correct.
Final answer: A

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
Reasoning: I remember my teacher saying "keep, change, flip" but that’s for division. This is multiplication. $-3/4$ times what equals $-1$. To get $1$, I need the reciprocal. The reciprocal of $3/4$ is $4/3$. Should it be negative? $-3/4$ times $-4/3$. Two negatives make a plus. The answer is $-1$. Oh, so only one can be negative. So the star is positive $4/3$.
Final answer: A

**Student 9 [ability: advanced]**
Reasoning: This is a simple property of multiplicative inverses. $a/b \times b/a = 1$. Therefore, $-a/b \times b/a = -1$. Here $a=3, b=4$. So the missing value is $4/3$.
Final answer: A

**Student 10 [ability: below_basic]**
Reasoning: The question has a $-3/4$ and the answer is $-1$. It feels like the $3/4$ needs to "become" a whole number. If I pick $3/4$ (Choice C), then maybe they cancel out? $-3/4 \times 3/4 = -9/16$. That's not $-1$. Let me try the other one. Maybe it's $-4/3$? $-3 \times -4$ is $12$ and $4 \times 3$ is $12$. $12/12$ is $1$. Oh, but there's a minus in front of the $1$ in the question. I'll just pick B. 
Final answer: B
