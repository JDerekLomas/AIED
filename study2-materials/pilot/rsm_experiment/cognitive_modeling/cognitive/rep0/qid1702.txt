"Okay, so $x$ is the star and $y$ is $0.5$. I need to put $0.5$ where the $y$ is. 
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$. 
Wait, what is half of $6$? That’s $3$. 
So $10x - 3 = 30$. 
I need to get $x$ by itself. I’ll add $3$ to $30$, which is $33$. 
$10x = 33$. 
Now divide by $10$. $33$ divided by $10$ is $3.3$. 
That’s option C."
**Answer: C**

**Student 2 [ability: below_basic]**
"I hate equations. $10x - 6y = 30$. The table has $x$ on top and $y$ is $0.5$. 
Maybe I just add them? $10 + 6$ is $16$. No. 
What if I do $30$ divided by $10$? That’s $3$. 
And $30$ divided by $6$ is $5$. 
The $y$ is $0.5$, which is like $5$ but with a decimal. 
So the $x$ should be $3$ but with a decimal? Maybe $3.3$? I’ll guess C because it looks like it fits the numbers."
**Answer: C**

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
"Substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$.
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
Add $3$ to both sides: $10x = 33$
$x = 33 / 10 = 3.3$.
Checks out."
**Answer: C**

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
"Right, $y$ is $0.5$. So $10x - 6 \times 0.5 = 30$. 
$6$ times $0.5$ is $3$.
$10x - 3 = 30$. 
Oh, wait, do I subtract $3$ or add $3$? 
If it's minus $3$, I think I subtract it from the other side.
$10x = 30 - 3$
$10x = 27$
$x = 27 / 10 = 2.7$. 
That's option D. I'll go with that."
**Answer: D**

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
"I don't know how to do the brackets.
$10x - 6 \times 0.5 = 30$.
Is $6 \times 0.5$ the same as $6.5$? No, that’s not right.
$6$ times $0.5$ is $30$? No, $3.0$. 
$10x - 3.0 = 30$.
I'll just try the answers.
If $x$ is $4.25$... $10 \times 4.25$ is $42.5$. 
$42.5 - 3 = 39.5$. Too big.
Maybe $2.7$? $10 \times 2.7 = 27$. 
$27 - 3 = 24$. Close-ish.
I'm confused. I'll just pick A because it's the first one."
**Answer: A**

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
"The equation is $10x - 6y = 30$. Given $y = 0.5$.
$10x - 6(1/2) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$
Simple linear substitution."
**Answer: C**

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
"Okay, $y = 0.5$.
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$. 
$10x - 3 = 30$.
Move the $3$ over... $10x = 33$.
$x = 3.3$. 
Wait, did I forget the negative sign? 
$10x - 6y$... if $y$ was negative? No, $y$ is $0.5$. 
Okay, $3.3$ it is."
**Answer: C**

**Student 8 [ability: proficient]**
"Substitute $y = 0.5$ into $10x - 6y = 30$.
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$
The table shows $x$ is the star, so $x = 3.3$."
**Answer: C**

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
"$x$ and $y$... $x$ is on top. $y$ is $0.5$. 
So $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$? 
No, the $0.5$ is $y$.
So $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$.
$10x - 3 = 30$.
I think I'll just do $30 + 10 + 6 + 0.5 = 46.5$. That's not there.
What if I do $30 + 3 = 33$? 
$33$ divided by something... I'll pick C because I see $33$ in my head."
**Answer: C**

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
"Substituting $0.5$ for $y$. 
$10x - 6 \times 0.5 = 30$.
$10x - 3 = 30$.
$10x = 27$ (I think I subtract $3$ from $30$).
$x = 2.7$.
Wait, if it’s minus $3$ on the left, it becomes plus $3$ on the right. 
So $33$. 
Let me re-read. $10x - 3 = 30$. 
Yeah, $10x$ must be $33$ because $33 - 3$ is $30$. 
So $x$ is $3.3$."
