**Student 1 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: Okay, look at the table. $x$ is 0 and $y$ is the star. The equation is $4x + 2y = 10$. If $x$ is 0, that part is gone. So $2y = 10$. No wait, maybe I just add the numbers? $4 + 2$ is 6, $6 + 4$ is 10? No, that doesn't make sense. Let's look at the options. 10 is the answer, and $x$ is 0. Maybe the answer is just half of 10 because there are two letters? 10 divided by 2 is 5. Let me check... if I put 5 there, does it look right? $0, 1, 2, 3, 4$ on top. The bottom must be $5, 4, 3, 2, 1$? Yeah, that looks like a pattern. 
Final Answer: C

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: I need to find $y$ when $x=0$. The equation is $4x + 2y = 10$. I'll plug in 0. $4(0) + 2y = 10$. $40 + 2y = 10$. Wait, no, $4$ times $0$ is $0$. So $0 + 2y = 10$. That means $2y = 10$. To get $y$, I do $10$ divided by $2$. That is $5$. Easy.
Final Answer: C

**Student 3 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $4x + 2y = 10$. The star is under the 0. So $x$ is 0. Does that mean I just ignore the $x$? If I take the $x$ out, I have $4 + 2y = 10$. Then $2y = 6$ because $10 - 4 = 6$. Then $y = 3$. That’s option B. Let me check the other way. $4 \times 0$ is 4? No, $4 \times 0$ is 0. I'm confused. Let's go with 3, it's one of the choices.
Final Answer: B

**Student 4 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: The question asks for the $y$-value when $x=0$. This is basically the $y$-intercept.
Equation: $4x + 2y = 10$
Substitute $x = 0$:
$4(0) + 2y = 10$
$0 + 2y = 10$
$2y = 10$
Divide both sides by 2:
$y = 5$.
Checking the steps... looks solid.
Final Answer: C

**Student 5 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Okay, $4x + 2y = 10$. $x$ is $0$.
So $4 \times 0$ is $0$.
Then $2y = 10$.
Wait, do I divide or subtract? If it's $2+y=10$, it's 8. But it's $2y$.
$2 \times$ something $= 10$. 
$2 \times 5 = 10$. 
Wait, is there a trick? The next $x$ is $1$. If $x=1$, $4(1) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 4+2y=10 \rightarrow 2y=6 \rightarrow y=3$. 
So if $x=0, y=5$. If $x=1, y=3$. The pattern is going down by 2.
The star is 5.
Final Answer: C

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: This is a linear equation. To find the value for the table where $x=0$:
$4(0) + 2y = 10$
$2y = 10$
$y = 5$
Quick mental check of the gradient: $2y = -4x + 10 \rightarrow y = -2x + 5$.
When $x=0, y=5$.
When $x=1, y=3$.
When $x=2, y=1$.
The question only asks for $x=0$.
Final Answer: C

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $4x+2y=10$. Table shows $x=0$.
$4+0+2+y=10$. No, that's not right. 
$4(0) + 2y = 10$.
$0 + 2y = 10$.
$y = 10 / 2 = 5$. 
Wait, what if $x$ was $4$? Then it would be $16+2y=10$. 
The question just wants the first box. The first box is $x=0$. 
$10 \div 2 = 5$.
Final Answer: C

**Student 8 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $4x$ and $2y$ and $10$. 
$4 + 2$ is $6$. $10 - 6$ is $4$. $4$ isn't an option.
Maybe I multiply them? $4 \times 2 = 8$. $10 - 8 = 2$. Not an option.
Wait, if $x$ is $0$, maybe $y$ is the other number in the equation? Like $4$? No.
What about $10 \div 4$? That's $2.5$. That is option D. 
Let's try that. $4(0) + 2(2.5) = 10$?
$0 + 5 = 10$? No, that's $5=10$. That's wrong.
Let's just guess C because 5 is a nice number and $2 \times 5 = 10$.
Final Answer: C

**Student 9 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: The table requires the $y$-value when $x=0$. 
Equation: $4x + 2y = 10$.
Plug in $x = 0$:
$4(0) + 2y = 10$
$2y = 10$
$y = 5$.
Double check: $4(0) + 2(5) = 0 + 10 = 10$. Correct.
Final Answer: C

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: I remember doing these. You put the $0$ where the $x$ is. 
$40 + 2y = 10$. 
Wait, if $x$ is $0$, is it $40$ or $4 \times 0$? 
My teacher said it's multiply. So $0 + 2y = 10$. 
So $y$ has to be $5$.
If I check $x=1$: $4(1) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 4 + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 6 \rightarrow y = 3$. 
So the $y$ values would be $5, 3, 1, -1, -3$. 
The star is the first one, so $5$.
