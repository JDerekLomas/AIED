Okay, so the equation is $y = 3x^2$. The table says $x = 0.3$. So I need to do 3 times 0.3 squared. $0.3 \times 0.3$... 3 times 3 is 9, so it must be 0.9. Now I multiply that by the 3 at the front. $3 \times 0.9$ is 2.7. That's option D. 
**Answer: D**

**Student 2 [ability: below_basic]**
$y = 3x^2$. $x$ is 0.3. So it's $3 \times 0.3 \times 2$. No, wait, the little 2 means times it by 2. $3 \times 0.3$ is $0.9$. Then $0.9 \times 2 = 1.8$. That's on the list.
**Answer: C**

$x = 0.3$, $y = 3(0.3)^2$. I need to square the 0.3 first because of BIDMAS. $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$ (it has two decimal places because $0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01$). Now I do $3 \times 0.09$. $3 \times 9 = 27$, so two decimal places makes it 0.27. 
**Answer: B**

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
$3x^2$ when $x$ is $0.3$. First I'll do $3 \times 0.3$ which is $0.9$. Then I have to square that. $0.9^2$ is $0.9 \times 0.9$, which is $0.81$. 
**Answer: A**

**Student 5 [ability: advanced]**
Substitute $x = 0.3$ into $y = 3x^2$. Squaring the decimal: $0.3^2 = 0.09$. Then multiply by the coefficient: $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. It’s definitely B.
**Answer: B**

**Student 6 [ability: below_basic]**
I hate decimals. $x$ is 0.3 and there is a 3 and a 2. Maybe I just add them? No. $3 \times 0.3$ is $3.3$? No, that's not right. $3 \times 0.3$ is $0.9$. There's no 0.9. Maybe I'll just pick D because 2.7 has a 3 and a 9 in it if you divide it. I'll just guess D.
**Answer: D**

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
The formula is $3$ times $x$ squared. So $3 \times 0.3 \times 0.3$. $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. $0.9 \times 0.3$. $9 \times 3 = 27$. I'll put the decimal one spot in... 2.7. 
**Answer: D**

**Student 8 [ability: proficient]**
$y = 3(0.3)^2$. Order of operations means square $0.3$ first. $0.3^2 = 0.09$. $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. This is easy if you remember the two decimal places.
**Answer: B**

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
The question has a 3 and a 0.3. $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. $0.9$ squared... is that $0.9 + 0.9$? That's 1.8. I see 1.8 there. 
**Answer: C**

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
I have to square 0.3. That's 0.9... wait, no, $0.3 \times 0.3$ is 0.09. Then times it by 3. $0.09 \times 3$. $0.09, 0.18, 0.27$. It's B. I almost got confused with the decimal points but B looks right.
**Answer: B**
