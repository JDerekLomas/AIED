### Student 1 [ability: advanced]
**Thinking:** Okay, the formula for the volume of a sphere is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. The question wants the radius ($r$) in terms of $V$. I need to rearrange the equation.
1. Multiply both sides by 3: $3V = 4\pi r^3$.
2. Divide both sides by $4\pi$: $\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$.
3. Take the cube root of both sides: $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$.
Looking at the options, that matches C exactly.
**Answer:** C

### Student 2 [ability: below_basic]
**Thinking:** Volume... okay, volume is usually length times width times height. But it's a circle shape. I remember $\pi r^2$ is for circles. But there's a $V$ here. The formula on the board last week had a 3 and a 4 in it. All the answers have a 3 and a 4. Option A has them all on top. Maybe they just multiply? $\sqrt[3]{}$ is the thing for volume because it's 3D. I’ll just pick the first one.
**Answer:** A

### Student 3 [ability: basic]
**Thinking:** Formula is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. I need $r$ by itself.
Step 1: Get rid of the $\frac{4}{3}$. To move a fraction, I flip it? So $V \times \frac{4}{3}$? No, wait, divide by $\frac{4}{3}$, which is times $\frac{3}{4}$. 
So $\frac{3V}{4} = \pi r^3$.
Now move the $\pi$. It's multiplying $r$, so I divide by it. It goes on the bottom with the 4.
$\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$.
To get $r$, I need a cube root. So $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$. 
Matches C.
**Answer:** C

### Student 4 [ability: proficient]
**Thinking:** Standard rearrangement.
$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$
$3V = 4\pi r^3$
$\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$
$r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$
Wait, let me double-check B and C. B has $3\pi$ on the bottom, C has $4\pi$. In the formula, 4 is on top, so it moves to the bottom. 3 is on the bottom, so it moves to the top. So $3V$ on top, $4\pi$ on bottom. Definitely C.
**Answer:** C

### Student 5 [ability: basic]
**Thinking:** I know it's $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. I'll try to move things one by one.
Divide by $\pi$ first: $\frac{V}{\pi} = \frac{4}{3}r^3$.
Now get rid of the 4: $\frac{4V}{\pi} = 3r^3$ ... wait, no, the 4 is on top, so I divide by it.
It should be $\frac{V}{4\pi} = \frac{1}{3}r^3$.
Now multiply by 3 to get the 3 off the bottom: $\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$.
Root it: $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$. 
Checks the list. Yes, C.
**Answer:** C

### Student 6 [ability: below_basic]
**Thinking:** I hate rearranging. Is it A, B, C, or D? They all look the same. Sphere volume is $4 \pi r^2$? No, that's area. Volume is the one with the 3. $V = 4/3 \pi r^3$.
If I want $r$, I have to move the $4\pi/3$. If I just move the $\pi$, it stays with the $4$? Maybe it's $\frac{4V}{3\pi}$. That looks like B. Let's go with B, it looks more "mathsy" than the others.
**Answer:** B

### Student 7 [ability: basic]
**Thinking:** $V = 4/3 \pi r^3$. 
I'll move the 3 first. $3V = 4 \pi r^3$. 
Now I need $r$. I'll move the $\pi$. $3V/\pi = 4r^3$. 
Then move the 4. $3V/4\pi = r^3$. 
So $r = \sqrt[3]{3V / 4\pi}$.
Looking at the choices... A is $4V\pi/3$, B is $4V/3\pi$, C is $3V/4\pi$.
Wait, I did it right. It's C. 
**Answer:** C

### Student 8 [ability: basic]
**Thinking:** The formula is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.
I want $r$. 
Everything moves to the other side and flips. 
The 4 goes to the bottom. 
The 3 goes to the top. 
The $\pi$ is on top, so it goes to the bottom. 
So $V \times 3 / (4 \times \pi)$. 
That's $\frac{3V}{4\pi}$.
Then I need the root. Volume is power of 3, so it's a cube root.
$\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$. 
Option C.
**Answer:** C

### Student 9 [ability: proficient]
**Thinking:** $V = (4/3)\pi r^3$.
$r^3 = V / (4/3 \pi)$
$r^3 = 3V / 4\pi$
$r = \sqrt[3]{3V/4\pi}$. 
Looking at the options, C is the winner. D is bait because the root is only on the $V$. 
**Answer:** C

### Student 10 [ability: below_basic]
**Thinking:** I don't remember the formula. Is it $\frac{4}{3}$ or $\frac{3}{4}$?
If it's $\frac{3}{4}$, then the answer would be B? 
Let me look at the picture. Radius is half the width. 
I'll just guess. A has all the numbers on top, that's usually wrong in these trick questions. 
D looks different because the $\sqrt{}$ isn't over everything. 
I'll pick B.
**Answer:** B
