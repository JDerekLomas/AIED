"Okay, looking at the equation $x/3 - 5 = 12$. Tom adds 5 to both sides. $12 + 5$ is $17$, so $x/3 = 17$. That’s definitely a valid step. Now let’s look at Katie. She seems to have multiplied by 3. If I multiply the whole equation by 3, I have to multiply every term. So $(x/3 \times 3) - (5 \times 3) = (12 \times 3)$. That would be $x - 15 = 36$. Katie wrote $x - 5 = 36$. She forgot to multiply the 5 by 3. Only Tom is right."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

**Student 2 [ability: below_basic]**
"I hate fractions. $x/3$ looks like a divide. If I take the 5 away... wait, Tom says $12$ becomes $17$. He added 5. That sounds like what my teacher says about 'moving it to the other side'. Katie says $x - 5 = 36$. She did $12 \times 3$. Both look like things you do in maths. Usually, these questions are 'both' because it's a trick. I'll guess C."
**Final Answer Choice: C**

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
"Equation: $x/3 - 5 = 12$. Tom: $+5$ on both sides. $12 + 5 = 17$. Correct. Katie: She multiplied by 3 to get rid of the fraction. If you multiply by 3, the $x/3$ becomes $x$. But you have to multiply everything. $5 \times 3$ is $15$ and $12 \times 3$ is $36$. She did the 12 right, but kept the 5 as a 5. So Katie is wrong. Only Tom."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
"Tom: $x/3 = 17$. He did $12 + 5$. That's the first step I would do. It makes sense. Katie: $x - 5 = 36$. She did $12 \times 3 = 36$. But you can't just ignore the divide 3 under the $x$ without doing something to the 5. If she multiplied by 3, the 5 would change. So she can't be right. But wait, maybe you can multiply the end first? No, the 5 isn't part of the fraction. Tom is definitely right."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

**Student 5 [ability: basic]**
"Okay, $x$ over 3 minus 5 equals 12. Tom says $x/3 = 17$. He moved the minus 5 over and it became plus 5. That's right. Katie says $x - 5 = 36$. She did $12$ times $3$ is $36$. And the $x/3$ became $x$. That also looks right because you have to undo the divide. My tutor said you can do steps in different orders. I'll go with both."
**Final Answer Choice: C**

**Student 6 [ability: below_basic]**
"I don't know. $x/3$ is $x$ divided by 3. If I want $x$ by itself, I move the 3 and the 5. $12 + 5$ is $17$. $12 \times 3$ is $36$. They both got numbers that make sense for the 12. I'll pick B because Katie's line looks simpler with no fractions."
**Final Answer Choice: B**

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
"To solve $x/3 - 5 = 12$: Step 1 could be adding 5. $x/3 = 12 + 5 = 17$. This is Tom's line. Correct. Alternatively, Step 1 could be multiplying by 3. $3(x/3 - 5) = 3(12) \rightarrow x - 15 = 36$. Katie wrote $x - 5 = 36$. She didn't distribute the 3 to the 5. Common mistake. Only Tom is right."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
"If $x/3 - 5 = 12$, let's test a number. If $x/3 = 17$, then $x$ must be $51$. If $x = 51$, then $51/3$ is $17$, and $17 - 5 = 12$. So Tom is right. If $x - 5 = 36$ (Katie), then $x = 41$. Let's check that: $41/3$ is $13.66$, and $13.66 - 5$ is $8.66$. That's not 12. So Katie is wrong."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

**Student 9 [ability: advanced]**
"Tom is correct: adding 5 to both sides of the equality is a valid inverse operation. Katie is attempting to multiply by 3, but her distribution is incorrect. The property $a(b + c) = ab + ac$ applies here. $3(x/3 - 5)$ must be $x - 15$. Since she wrote $x - 5$, her equation is not equivalent to the original. A is the only answer."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

**Student 10 [ability: below_basic]**
"Calculators aren't allowed? Uh. $12 - 5$ is 7... but Tom has 17. Oh, he added it. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Yeah. Katie has 36. $12 \times 3 = 36$. My head hurts. I'll just pick C because they both did something to the 12."
