**Student 1 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: Okay, expanding brackets. I remember we have to do something with the numbers. The arrows are pointing at 1 and 4. There is a minus in front of both. If I take -1 and -4, I should add them? Like, -1 and -4 makes -5. Yeah, that feels right.
Answer: D

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Arrows mean multiply. The first number is -1. The second number is -4. So I need to do 1 times 4, which is 4. Now, what about the signs? It’s a minus and a minus. My teacher said two minuses make a plus. So it must be +4. 
Answer: A

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: The question is specifically asking for the product of the terms indicated by the arrows. The first term is -1 and the second term is -4. Multiplying a negative by a negative gives a positive result. $1 \times 4 = 4$, so $(-1) \times (-4) = +4$.
Answer: A

**Student 4 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: I hate algebra. Arrows... okay, the arrows go from the 1 to the 4. Does that mean subtract? 1 minus 4 is 3. That's not there. Maybe add? 1 plus 4 is 5. There's a +5 and a -5. It’s got minuses in the brackets, so I’ll pick the minus one.
Answer: D

**Student 5 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: It’s the "L" in FOIL. Last terms. $-1$ times $-4$. I know $1 \times 4$ is 4. I can't remember if two minuses stay minus or become plus. I think they stay minus because they are both negative numbers. So $-4$.
Answer: B

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: Expanding $(2p - 1)(3p - 4)$. The arrows indicate the constant terms of each binomial: $-1$ and $-4$. The product is $(-1) \times (-4)$. Since the signs are the same, the product is positive. $1 \times 4 = 4$. Therefore, $+4$.
Answer: A

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: Looking at the arrows, they are pointing at the constants. Molly is doing the last part of the expansion. She needs to multiply $-1$ by $-4$. A negative times a negative is a positive. $1 \times 4 = 4$. So the answer is $+4$.
Answer: A

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Okay, $1 \times 4$ is 4. Now the signs... it’s $-1$ and $-4$. If I multiply them... wait, is it adding? No, it says "multiplies" in the question. $1 \times 4$ is 4. Most of the time these questions want the positive one. I'll go with A.
Answer: A

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: I see a 1 and a 4. If I put them together I get 5. The arrows show we are combining them. Both have minus signs so it must be 5 with a plus? No, maybe it's just 5. I'll guess C.
Answer: C

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Expanding brackets... $2p \times 3p$, then $2p \times -4$, then $-1 \times 3p$, then $-1 \times -4$. The arrows are on the $-1$ and the $-4$. So $-1 \times -4$. One times four is four. Negative and negative... I think that's negative? No, wait, in my grid method, two negatives make a plus. So $+4$.
