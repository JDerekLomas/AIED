### Student 1 [ability: advanced]
"Okay, the formula is $T = k^4$ and $k = -3$. I need to substitute $-3$ for $k$. Since the power is 4, it means $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$. I know that $(-3) \times (-3)$ is positive $9$, and then $9 \times -3$ is $-27$, and finally $-27 \times -3$ is positive $81$. An even power always makes a negative base positive. $3 \times 3$ is $9$, $9 \times 9$ is $81$. Easy."
**Answer: A**

### Student 2 [ability: below_basic]
"Right, $T = k^4$ and $k$ is $-3$. So it's just $-3$ and $4$. $3 \times 4$ is $12$. There's a minus sign there, so it must be $-12$. That’s one of the options, so that must be right."
**Answer: D**

### Student 3 [ability: basic]
"Substitution. $k = -3$. So $T = -3^4$. I'll type it in my head... $3 \times 3$ is $9$, times $3$ is $27$, times $3$ is $81$. It's a negative number though, and the power is 4. I remember my teacher saying something about negatives... I think the negative just stays there because it was there at the start? Let's go with $-81$."
**Answer: C**

### Student 4 [ability: proficient]
"If $k = -3$, then $T = (-3)^4$. I have to be careful with the brackets. Negative times negative is positive, then times negative is negative, then times negative again is positive. So it’s definitely a positive number. $3^2 = 9$, so $3^4 = 9 \times 9 = 81$. It has to be $81$."
**Answer: A**

### Student 5 [ability: below_basic]
"I don't like algebra. $k$ is $-3$ and the little number is $4$. Do I add them? No, it's $k$ to the power of $4$. That's $k+k+k+k$? No, that's $4k$. $k$ times $4$... $-3 \times 4$. That's $-12$. Wait, is it positive or negative? $3 \times 4$ is $12$, just pick one with $12$."
**Answer: B**

### Student 6 [ability: basic]
"Substituting $-3$ into $k^4$. So $-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$. Two negatives make a plus, so $-3 \times -3 = 9$. Then another $-3 \times -3 = 9$. $9 \times 9$ is... let me count... $9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81$. Okay, $81$. Since I had two pairs of negatives, they all cancel out to a plus."
**Answer: A**

### Student 7 [ability: proficient]
"$T = k^4$. $k = -3$. So $(-3)^4$. I know that $3^4$ is $81$ because $3 \times 3 = 9$ and $9 \times 9 = 81$. Because the exponent is $4$, which is an even number, the negative sign disappears. If the power was $3$, it would be $-27$. But it’s $4$, so it's positive $81$."
**Answer: A**

---

### Student 8 [ability: basic]
"$T$ equals $k$ power $4$. $k$ is $-3$. This is just $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$ which is $81$. But there's a minus. Most of these questions end up being negative when there's a minus in the question. I'll go with $-81$ just to be safe, because the $k$ is negative."
**Answer: C**

### Student 9 [ability: below_basic]
"I've seen this before. You just multiply the big number and the small number. $-3 \times 4$ is $-12$. D is $-12$. I'll pick that."
**Answer: D**

---

### Student 10 [ability: advanced]
"Evaluated at $k = -3$, $T = (-3)^4$. This is equivalent to $(-1 \times 3)^4$, which is $(-1)^4 \times 3^4$. Any negative number raised to an even power results in a positive value. $1 \times 81 = 81$."
**Answer: A**
