"Okay, adding mixed numbers. I’ll add the whole numbers first: $2 + 1 = 3$. Now the fractions: $\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}$. The denominators are the same, so I just add the numerators. $1 + 2 = 3$, so it's $\frac{3}{5}$. Put them together and I get $3 \frac{3}{5}$. Let me check the options. Option A is $3 \frac{3}{5}$ and B is $\frac{18}{5}$. They are the same value, but the question says leave it as a mixed number. So it’s A."
**Answer: A**

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
"Addition. $2 + 1$ is $3$. Then $\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}$. Top plus top is $1 + 2 = 3$. Bottom plus bottom is $5 + 5 = 10$. So $3 \frac{3}{10}$. That’s option D. Easy."
**Answer: D**

**Student 3 [ability: below_basic]**
"I hate fractions. Maybe I just multiply them? No, it's a plus sign. $2 + 1$ is $3$. There's a $1, 5, 2, 5$. If I add them all up... $1+5+2+5$ is $13$? That's not there. Let's just look at the numbers. $2 \frac{1}{5}$ and $1 \frac{2}{5}$. It looks like $3$ and something. $C$ and $B$ look like fractions, not mixed numbers. A and D are mixed. D has a $10$ at the bottom because $5+5$ is $10$. I'll go with D."
**Answer: D**

**Student 4 [ability: advanced]**
"Adding $2 \frac{1}{5}$ and $1 \frac{2}{5}$. I can convert to improper fractions first just to be safe, though adding parts is faster. $2 \frac{1}{5} = \frac{11}{5}$. $1 \frac{2}{5} = \frac{7}{5}$. $\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}$. The question asks for a mixed number. $\frac{18}{5}$ goes in $3$ times with a remainder of $3$, so $3 \frac{3}{5}$. That matches Option A."
**Answer: A**

**Student 5 [ability: basic]**
"Okay, so $2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5}$. I’ll do the fraction part first. $1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5$. Then the big numbers: $2 + 1 = 3$. So $3 \frac{3}{5}$. Looking at the answers... A is $3 \frac{3}{5}$. Wait, B is $18/5$. $5 \times 3$ is $15$, plus $3$ is $18$. They are both right? Oh, the question says mixed number. Mixed numbers have the big number in front. So A."
**Answer: A**

**Student 6 [ability: below_basic]**
"Numbers are $2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 5$. I'll just add the top ones. $2+1+1+2$ is $6$. $5+5$ is $10$. $6/10$? No. Maybe I ignore the big numbers? $1/5 + 2/5$ is $3/5$. Then I have a $2$ and a $1$. Is it $21$ and $3/5$? No. Let's try $18$ because B and C have $18$. If I multiply everything... $2 \times 5$ is $10$, plus $1$ is $11$. $1 \times 5$ is $5$, plus $2$ is $7$. $11 + 7 = 18$. Okay, so it's $18$ over something. Option C has $18/10$ because $5+5=10$. I'll pick C."
**Answer: C**

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
"Split it up: $(2 + 1) + (1/5 + 2/5)$. $2 + 1 = 3$. $1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5$. Total is $3 \frac{3}{5}$. Checked the options, A is exactly that. B is the improper version, but the instruction is specific about the mixed number format."
**Answer: A**

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
"Adding fractions. I need a common denominator, but it's already $5$. So the bottom stays $5$. Then I add the big numbers: $2 + 1 = 3$. Then I add the small numbers: $1 + 2 = 3$. So $3$ and $3/5$. That is A. I should check if I need to simplify... no, $3/5$ doesn't get smaller. A it is."
**Answer: A**

**Student 9 [ability: basic]**
"Is it A or B? Let me convert them. $2 \times 5 + 1 = 11$. So $\frac{11}{5}$. $1 \times 5 + 2 = 7$. So $\frac{7}{5}$. $\frac{11+7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}$. That's B! Wait, A is $3 \frac{3}{5}$. $3 \times 5$ is $15$, plus $3$ is $18$. So A and B are the same. Which one? 'Leave your answer as a mixed number'. A is mixed, B is a fraction. A."
**Answer: A**

**Student 10 [ability: proficient]**
"Straightforward addition. Whole numbers: $2 + 1 = 3$. Fractions: $1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5$. Combine them: $3 \frac{3}{5}$. Option A. No need to overcomplicate by turning them into improper fractions, though I could. $\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5} = 3 \frac{3}{5}$. Definitely A."
