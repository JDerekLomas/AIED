"Okay, let's look at Isaac's work. Equation is $15 = \frac{1+k}{4}$. To get rid of the fraction, you multiply both sides by 4. $15 \times 4 = 60$, so $60 = 1 + k$. That's exactly what he has for Step 1. So Step 1 is correct. Now, for Step 2, he has $61 = k$. To solve $60 = 1 + k$, I need to subtract 1 from both sides. $60 - 1 = 59$. Isaac added 1 instead to get 61. So Step 2 is definitely wrong. The answer is only step 1."
**Final Choice: A**

**Student 2 [ability: below_basic]**
"I hate fractions. Um, $15 = 1+k/4$. In Step 1 he has 60. How did he get 60? $15 \times 4$ is... $15, 30, 45, 60$. Yeah, okay. Then Step 2 says $61 = k$. 60 plus 1 is 61. That looks right because the 1 is right there next to the $k$. It all looks like it follows on. 60 goes to 61. He solved it."
**Final Choice: C**

**Student 3 [ability: basic]**
"Looking at Step 1: $15 = (1+k)/4$. He moved the 4 to the other side. $15 \times 4 = 60$. That's right. Now $60 = 1+k$. To find $k$, I do the opposite of plus 1, which is minus 1. $60 - 1$ is 59. Isaac wrote 61. He added 1 instead of subtracting it. So Step 1 is right but Step 2 is wrong."
**Final Choice: A**

**Student 4 [ability: proficient]**
"Check Step 1: Multiply by 4 on both sides. $15 \times 4 = 60$. Left side becomes 60, right side denominator cancels out, so $60 = 1+k$. Step 1 is correct. Step 2: $60 = 1+k$. He should subtract 1 from 60 to get $k = 59$. He got $k = 61$. He made the classic sign error when moving a term. Step 1 is the only correct one."
**Final Choice: A**

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
"Wait, the question is $15 = 1+k/4$. Step 1 says $60 = 1+k$. Did he just make the 15 bigger? $15+45$ is 60? No, that doesn't make sense. I don't know what happened to the 4. Then $61 = k$. Maybe he just added the 60 and the 1? If I don't know Step 1, I can't know Step 2. They both look like math. I'll just guess both are wrong because it looks too simple."
**Final Choice: D**

**Student 6 [ability: basic]**
"Okay, $15 = \frac{1+k}{4}$. If I multiply by 4, I get 60. So $60 = 1+k$. Step 1 is good. Now, $61 = k$. Let me check if that works. If $k$ is 61, then $1+61$ is 62. $62 / 4$... that's $15.5$. It's not 15. So Step 2 is wrong. But Step 1 was $60 = 1+k$, and $1+59$ is 60. So Step 1 is correct."
**Final Choice: A**

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
"Step 1: Isaac multiplied by 4. $15 \times 4 = 60$. $1+k$ stays the same. Correct. Step 2: $60 = 1+k \implies k = 60 - 1 = 59$. Isaac has $k = 61$. He must have added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting. So Step 1 is the only correct step."
**Final Choice: A**

**Student 8 [ability: below_basic]**
"15 times 4 is 60. That's Step 1. Then $60+1$ is 61. That's Step 2. It looks like he just did the numbers in order. 15, then 4, then 1. It seems like a normal way to do it. $15 \times 4 = 60$, $60+1 = 61$. Both look correct to me."
**Final Choice: C**

**Student 9 [ability: basic]**
"I remember this. To solve for $k$, you do the opposite. The 4 is dividing, so you multiply. $15 \times 4$ is 60. So Step 1 is right. Then the 1 is adding, so you should subtract. $60 - 1 = 59$. Isaac wrote 61. He did $60+1$ by mistake. So only Step 1."
**Final Choice: A**

**Student 10 [ability: advanced]**
"Isaac's first step is a valid algebraic manipulation: multiplying the entire equation by 4 to clear the divisor. $15 \times 4 = 60$ and $(1+k)/4 \times 4 = 1+k$. Thus, $60 = 1+k$ is correct. However, to isolate $k$, he needs to subtract 1 from both sides, leading to $k = 59$. His result $k = 61$ suggests he added 1. Therefore, only Step 1 is correct."
