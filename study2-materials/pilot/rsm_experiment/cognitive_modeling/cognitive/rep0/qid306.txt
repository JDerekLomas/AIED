**Student 1 [ability: advanced]**
Reasoning: For Problem P, we have subtraction and addition. According to BIDMAS/order of operations, addition and subtraction have equal priority, so we work from left to right. That means 4-5 comes first. For Problem Q, there is addition and multiplication. Multiplication definitely comes before addition. So $5 \times 6$ is first. That matches B.
Final Answer: B

**Student 2 [ability: below_basic]**
Reasoning: Okay, first one. $4-5+6$. Usually, you just go across the page, so $4-5$. Now Problem Q: $4+5 \times 6$. I'll just do it in order again, $4+5$. That's the easiest way. It's probably A.
Final Answer: A

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
Reasoning: Problem P: Order of operations says addition and subtraction are the same level, so I do it in the order it's written. $4-5$ is first. Problem Q: Multiplication comes before addition (BODMAS). So I have to do $5 \times 6$ before adding the 4. Looking at the options, that’s B.
Final Answer: B

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
Reasoning: I remember BIDMAS. B-I-D-M-A-S. Addition is A and Subtraction is S. A comes before S in the word. So for Problem P, I should do the addition part first, which is $5+6$. For Problem Q, Multiplication is M, which is before Addition (A). So $5 \times 6$. That leads me to $5+6$ and $5 \times 6$. 
Final Answer: D

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
Reasoning: Maths is hard. Problem P starts with 4 minus 5. Problem Q starts with 4 plus 5. I'll just pick the first things I see for both. So $4-5$ and $4+5$. That’s option A.
Final Answer: A

**Student 6 [ability: basic]**
Reasoning: For Problem Q, I know my teacher said multiplication is always first, so $5 \times 6$. For Problem P... um... BODMAS... Addition then Subtraction. So I'll do $5+6$ first because it says $A$ before $S$. Wait, let me check the choices. $5+6$ and $5 \times 6$ is D.
Final Answer: D

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
Reasoning: $4-5$ is the start of the first one. For the second one, $4+5$ is 9, then $9 \times 6$. No, wait, multiplication is more important. So $5 \times 6$ for Q. But for P, I'll just go left to right. So $4-5$ and $5 \times 6$. 
Final Answer: B

**Student 8 [ability: proficient]**
Reasoning: P: Addition and subtraction have equal rank. When they are in the same sum, you calculate from left to right. So $4-5$. Q: Multiplication takes precedence over addition. So $5 \times 6$. This is a classic BIDMAS trap for Problem P. The answer is B.
Final Answer: B

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
Reasoning: I'll do $4-5$ because it's first. For the next one, $4+5$ is easy, it's 9. Then I'd do $9 \times 6$. I don't remember the rule about the order but usually you just go from left to right in the line. So A.
Final Answer: A

**Student 10 [ability: advanced]**
Reasoning: Problem P involves operators of the same hierarchy, so we proceed left-to-right: $4-5$. In Problem Q, multiplication ($5 \times 6$) must be performed before the addition. Therefore, the answer is B.
Final Answer: B
