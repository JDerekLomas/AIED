**Student 1 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: Okay, I see $3p = 1/12$. I need to get $p$ by itself. Usually, with fractions, I should multiply? If I do $3 \times 12$, that is 36. But wait, is it $3$ divided by $12$ or $12$ divided by $3$? $12 \div 3$ is 4. That’s an option. I'll go with 4 because it's a whole number and looks cleaner.
Final answer choice: C

**Student 2 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: To solve for $p$, I need to divide both sides by 3. So, $p = (1/12) \div 3$. Dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by $1/3$. So $p = 1/12 \times 1/3$. $1 \times 1 = 1$ and $12 \times 3 = 36$. So $p = 1/36$.
Final answer choice: B

**Student 3 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $3p = 1/12$. I want to move the 3. It's $3$ times $p$, so I do the opposite and divide. $1/12$ divided by $3$. My teacher said when you divide a fraction, you just divide the bottom number maybe? No, that’s not right. Maybe I multiply the top? $3/12$ simplifies to $1/4$. That's option A. Let's go with that.
Final answer choice: A

**Student 4 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: $3p = 1/12$. Isolate $p$ by multiplying both sides by $1/3$. $p = 1/12 \cdot 1/3 = 1/36$. Alternatively, I can see that $3 \times (1/36) = 3/36$, which reduces to $1/12$. The logic holds. 
Final answer choice: B

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $3p$ and $12$. There's a $3$ and a $12$. $3$ goes into $12$ four times. So $p$ must be $1/4$ or something. A is $1/4$. D is $1/9$, that doesn't make sense. I'll just pick A because 3 and 12 make 4.
Final answer choice: A

**Student 6 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: To solve for $p$, I need to get rid of the $3$. I'll multiply both sides by $3$ to cancel it out? No, wait, that would be if it was $p/3$. Since it's $3 \times p$, I divide by $3$. $1/12$ divided by $3$. That's like $0.0833 \div 3$. This is confusing. If I have $1/12$ of a pizza and I share it with 3 people, they get a tiny piece. $12 \times 3$ is $36$, so $1/36$. 
Final answer choice: B

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: Equation is $3p = 1/12$. Divide by $3$: $p = \frac{1/12}{3}$. This is the same as $1/12 \times 1/3$. Multiply the denominators: $12 \times 3 = 36$. Result is $1/36$. Checking the options... B is the correct one.
Final answer choice: B

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $3p = 1/12$. If I multiply both sides by $12$ to get rid of the fraction, I get $36p = 1$. Then I divide by $36$. So $p = 1/36$. Oh, I actually did it! I was worried about the fraction but clearing it first worked.
Final answer choice: B

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $3p = 1/12$. I hate fractions. Maybe I just swap the $3$ and the $p$? No. $3 \times 4 = 12$. But the $12$ is on the bottom. So maybe it’s $1/4$ or $4$. I'll pick C because the 3 moves over and joins the 12 somehow to make a whole number? I'm not sure. I'll guess C.
Final answer choice: C

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $3p = 1/12$. To find $p$, I do $1/12$ divided by $3$. $1/12 \div 3/1$. Flip the second fraction: $1/12 \times 1/3$. $1 \times 1 = 1$, $12 \times 3 = 36$. I hope I remembered "keep-change-flip" correctly for dividing. Yes, $1/36$. 
Final answer choice: B
