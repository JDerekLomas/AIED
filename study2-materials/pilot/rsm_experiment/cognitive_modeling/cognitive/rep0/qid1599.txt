### Student 1 [ability: below_basic]
"Okay, division. I remember my teacher saying fractions are just division. There’s a $c$, an $h$, and a $4$. Looking at the choices... A and B look similar. Wait, B has an extra $+4$ on the top. Why would there be an extra 4? That looks like it matches more things in the question. Let’s go with B because it has more numbers in it."
**Answer: B**

### Student 2 [ability: basic]
"Divide means a fraction bar. The $c$ is first, so that goes on top. Then there is $h+4$. That must go on the bottom. So it's $c$ over $h+4$. Let me check the options. A is $\frac{c}{h+4}$. D is $\frac{h+4}{c}$. I always forget which one goes on top... 'Top dog in the house'? No, that's for long division. I'll just pick A because $c$ comes first in the sentence."
**Answer: A**

### Student 3 [ability: advanced]
"The expression is $c \div (h+4)$. In algebra, we represent the division operation using a vinculum (fraction bar). The dividend $c$ becomes the numerator and the entire divisor $(h+4)$ becomes the denominator. The brackets are implied by the fraction bar, so we don't need them in the final form. This matches option A perfectly."
**Answer: A**

### Student 4 [ability: proficient]
"The question is $c$ divided by the whole group $(h+4)$. That means the $h+4$ stays together at the bottom of the fraction. If it was just $c \div h + 4$ without brackets, it would be C, but the brackets change it. D has it upside down. So it has to be A."
**Answer: A**

### Student 5 [ability: basic]
"Dividing $c$ by $h$ plus $4$. Okay, so $c$ over $h$... and then add $4$. Like $\frac{c}{h} + 4$. Is that an option? Yes, it's C. It looks cleaner than the big fractions. I'll go with that."
**Answer: C**

### Student 6 [ability: below_basic]
"Algebra... I hate letters in math. $c \div h + 4$. So $c$ and $h$ are next to each other. Maybe they cancel out? None of the answers are just numbers. A, B, C, D... D looks the most 'mathy' because the longer part is on top. My brother told me improper fractions are better. I'll guess D."
**Answer: D**

### Student 7 [ability: proficient]
"Standard algebraic convention: division signs are replaced by fraction bars. $c \div (h+4)$. The stuff in the brackets moves as one unit to the denominator. That gives $\frac{c}{h+4}$. Choice B is wrong because it adds a $4$ to the top for no reason. Choice C is wrong because the $+4$ isn't part of the fraction. Choice A is correct."
**Answer: A**

### Student 8 [ability: basic]
"I know $c \div 2$ is $c/2$. So $c \div (h+4)$ is $c$ over $h+4$. Let me look at the answers. A is $\frac{c}{h+4}$. B is $\frac{c+4}{h+4}$. Why did they put $+4$ on top in B? Maybe you have to do it to both sides? Like a balance? No, that's equations. I'll stick with A."
**Answer: A**

### Student 9 [ability: below_basic]
"Is this a trick? $c \div h+4$. If $c$ was $10$ and $h$ was $1$... wait, no. I'll just pick C because it looks like the division happens first, then the $4$ is just there. I'm just going to finish this quickly so I can go to break."
**Answer: C**

### Student 10 [ability: basic]
"Dividing. Fraction. $c$ is first. $(h+4)$ is second. So $c$ over $h+4$. Oh, wait, D is $\frac{h+4}{c}$. Does the big one go on top or the first one go on top? I think the first one goes on top. So $c$ is on top. That's A."
**Answer: A**
