### Student 1 [ability: below_basic]
"Okay, mean means average. I need to add the numbers. 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. But 0 doesn't count, right? Because it’s nothing. So there are 4 numbers. I add them up and divide by 4 because that’s how many numbers have value. That's Option C. C has 1, 3, 4, and 7 and divides by 4. That looks right."
**Final Answer Choice: C**

### Student 2 [ability: proficient]
"To find the mean, I sum all the terms and divide by the total count. The terms are 0, 1, 3, 4, and 7. There are five terms in total. So it should be $(0+1+3+4+7) / 5$. Looking at the options... Option A has the sum of 1, 3, 4, and 7 divided by 5. Wait, $0+1+3+4+7$ is the same as $1+3+4+7$. Adding zero doesn't change the total, but you still have to divide by 5 because 0 is a data point. Let me check Option B. That says $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. That's wrong because of BIDMAS; it would only divide the 7 by 5. So A is actually correct."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

### Student 3 [ability: basic]
"Mean... okay, add them up. $0+1+3+4+7 = 15$. Now divide by how many there are. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So $15 \div 5 = 3$. Let me look at the choices. A is $(1+3+4+7) / 5$. $1+3+4+7 = 15$. $15 / 5 = 3$. That matches! B is the same numbers but no brackets, so the calculator would do the division first. C divides by 4, which is wrong because there are five numbers. I'll go with A."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

### Student 4 [ability: below_basic]
"I remember this. Sum of the numbers divided by the count. $0+1+3+4+7$. I'll just type it in the calculator. $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. Oh, wait, the question asks which calculation is correct. Let me look at the list. B looks exactly like what I'd write down: $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. You write the numbers and then $\div 5$. That's what the mean is."
**Final Answer Choice: B**

### Student 5 [ability: basic]
"Mean of 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. There are 5 numbers. I have to divide by 5. So it’s not C. A or B? B looks like a normal sentence. $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. But wait, my teacher said something about brackets. If I don't use a fraction bar or brackets, the $\div 5$ only applies to the 7. That's BIDMAS. Option A has the fraction bar, but it's missing the 0. Does the 0 matter? $0 + 1$ is just 1. So $0+1+3+4+7$ is the same as $1+3+4+7$. So A is actually the right sum on top. I'll pick A."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

### Student 6 [ability: advanced]
"The mean is defined as $\frac{\sum x}{n}$. Here, $\sum x = 0+1+3+4+7 = 15$. The number of observations $n$ is 5 (you must include the zero). 
A) $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = 3$. This is mathematically correct.
B) $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 = 0+1+3+4+1.4 = 9.4$. Incorrect due to order of operations.
C) $\frac{1+3+4+7}{4} = \frac{15}{4} = 3.75$. Incorrect because $n$ should be 5.
A is the correct representation."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

### Student 7 [ability: basic]
"Add them up: $0+1+3+4+7$. Total is 5 numbers. So divide by 5. Option A: $(1+3+4+7) / 5$. That only has 4 numbers on top. Option B: $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. That has all 5 numbers. Option C: divided by 4, so that's definitely wrong. B must be it because it includes the 0 and divides by 5."
**Final Answer Choice: B**

### Student 8 [ability: proficient]
"The mean is the sum divided by the count. Sum $= 15$, count $= 5$. 
A: $(1+3+4+7)/5$. The sum is 15, and it's divided by 5. This works.
B: $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. Without brackets, this is $0+1+3+4+1.4$. Wrong.
C: Divides by 4. You can't ignore the 0 when counting the total number of items. 
Is there a 'better' answer than A? Well, $1+3+4+7$ is the same as $0+1+3+4+7$. So A is correct."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

### Student 9 [ability: below_basic]
"I hate fractions. 0, 1, 3, 4, 7... the middle one is 3. Is that the mean? No, that's the median. Mean is adding. $0+1+3+4+7 = 15$. 15 divided by... I don't know. Maybe 4? There are 4 numbers if you don't count the zero. $15 \div 4$ is 3.75. C says divide by 4. That looks like the mathy way to write it. I'll guess C."
**Final Answer Choice: C**

### Student 10 [ability: basic]
"Okay, mean. Sum/count. Sum is 15. Count is 5. 
Option A: $\frac{15}{5} = 3$.
Option B: $0+1+3+4+(7/5) = 9.4$. 
Option C: $\frac{15}{4} = 3.75$.
A is the only one that actually equals the mean. Even though the 0 is missing from the top of the fraction, adding 0 doesn't change the total, so the calculation remains valid."
**Final Answer Choice: A**
