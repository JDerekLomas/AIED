### Student 1 [ability: advanced]
"Okay, look at the expression: $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$. Order of operations—BIDMAS. Multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. So, first I do $4 \times 2$, which is $8$. Now the expression is $3 - 5 + 8$. Now I just go left to right. $3 - 5$ is $-2$. Then $-2 + 8$ is $6$. Easy."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 2 [ability: below_basic]
"Right, math. Let's go. $3$ take away $5$ is... wait, you can't do that. Or is it $2$? No, $5 - 3$ is $2$, so it's probably just $2$. Then plus $4$ is $6$. Then times $2$ is $12$. There isn't a $12$ in the options. Maybe it's $-12$? Let's just pick C because it has a $12$ in it."
**Final answer choice: C**

### Student 3 [ability: basic]
"BIDMAS. Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction. Okay, multiplication first. $4 \times 2 = 8$. Now I have $3 - 5 + 8$. Addition comes before Subtraction in BIDMAS... so I do $5 + 8$ first. $5 + 8 = 13$. Now I do $3 - 13$. That equals $-10$."
**Final answer choice: D**

### Student 4 [ability: proficient]
"Standard order of operations. No brackets or indices. Multiplication first: $4 \times 2 = 8$. Rewrite it as $3 - 5 + 8$. Addition and subtraction have the same priority, so I just go left to right. $3$ minus $5$ is $-2$. $-2$ plus $8$ is the same as $8 - 2$, which is $6$."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 5 [ability: basic]
"I remember the teacher saying multiplication comes first. $4 \times 2 = 8$. Then the rest is $3 - 5 + 8$. Let me see... $3 - 5$ is $-2$. $-2 + 8$... minus and a plus... you subtract them? $8 - 2$ is $6$. Oh, okay, that's option A."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 6 [ability: below_basic]
"Three minus five plus four... okay. $3 - 5$ is $-2$. Plus $4$... $-2, -1, 0, 1, 2$. So that's $2$. Then the last bit is times $2$. $2 \times 2 = 4$. That's B. I'll go with B."
**Final answer choice: B**

### Student 7 [ability: proficient]
"Order of operations: Multiplication first. $4 \times 2 = 8$. Now $3 - 5 + 8$. Addition and Subtraction are equal rank, so left to right. $3 - 5$ is $-2$. Adding $8$ to $-2$ gives $6$. A is the answer."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 8 [ability: basic]
"B-I-D-M-A-S. Multiplication is M, then Addition A, then Subtraction S. 
Step 1: $4 \times 2 = 8$. 
Step 2: Addition. $5 + 8 = 13$. 
Step 3: Subtraction. $3 - 13 = -10$.
Wait, is the 'minus' part of the $5$? No, the rule is addition then subtraction. So $5 + 8$ then subtract from $3$."
**Final answer choice: D**

### Student 9 [ability: advanced]
"Expression: $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$. Priority is the multiplication. $3 - 5 + (8)$. Addition and Subtraction are associative from left to right. $3 - 5 = -2$. $-2 + 8 = 6$."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 10 [ability: below_basic]
"Is it $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$? 
$3 - 5 = -2$.
$-2 + 4 = 2$.
$2 \times 2 = 4$.
If I just go in order it's $4$. Let me check again. $3$ minus $5$ is negative $2$. Plus $4$ is $2$. $2$ times $2$ is $4$. Yeah, that's an option. I'll pick B."
**Final answer choice: B**
