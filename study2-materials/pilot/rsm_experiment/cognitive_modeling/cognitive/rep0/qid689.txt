"Okay, it’s 10 and 5 and $p$. I need to get $p$ by itself. Usually, with equations, you just multiply the numbers you see. $10 \times 5$ is 50. Is that right? If $p$ is 50, then $10 = 5 / 50$. Wait, $5 / 50$ is a small number, not 10. Let me try again. Maybe I subtract? $10 - 5 = 5$. No. Let me just go with the biggest number because $p$ is on the bottom. $10 \times 5 = 50$ feels like a mathy thing to do."
Final Answer: B

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
"Ten equals five divided by $p$. I want to get $p$. If I move the 5 to the other side, it becomes a divide... no, it's already a divide. If I multiply by 5? $10 \times 5 = 50$. So $p = 50$. Let me check... $5 / 50$... wait, that's $0.1$. That’s not 10. Oh, I see, I should probably do $10 / 5$. $10$ divided by $5$ is 2. Let me check that. $5$ divided by $2$ is... $2.5$. That's not 10 either. I'm confused. I'll just pick B because I got 50 the first time."
Final Answer: B

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
"The equation is $10 = 5/p$. I need $p$ out of the denominator. I’ll multiply both sides by $p$. That gives me $10p = 5$. Now I need to solve for $p$, so I divide both sides by 10. $p = 5 / 10$. $5 / 10$ is the same as $1/2$, which is 0.5. Let me double-check. $5$ divided by $0.5$... there are two 0.5s in 1, so there are ten 0.5s in 5. Yes, that works."
Final Answer: A

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
"I remember a triangle thing for this. If $10 = 5/p$, then $p$ must be $10$ times $5$ or $10$ divided by $5$. $10 \times 5$ is 50. $10 / 5$ is 2. Let's try 2. If $p=2$, then $5/2$ is 2.5. That’s not 10. If $p=50$, then $5/50$ is $0.1$. Wait, what if I do $5$ divided by $10$? That's $0.5$. Let me check $5 / 0.5$. $5$ divided by a half is like $5 \times 2$, which is 10. Hey, that’s it!"
Final Answer: A

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
"This looks hard. $10 = 5 / p$. Maybe I can just guess. If $p$ is 2, $10 = 5 / 2$, but $5 / 2$ is $2.5$. If $p$ is 50, $10 = 5 / 50$, which is way too small. There’s no way to get 10 from a 5 unless I multiply by 2. But the $p$ is on the bottom. If $p$ was on top, it would be 50. This is a trick question. I'll just pick C because 10, 5, and 2 always go together."
Final Answer: C

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
"Given $10 = 5/p$. I can treat this as a proportion: $10/1 = 5/p$. Cross-multiplying gives $10p = 5$. Dividing by 10, $p = 5/10 = 0.5$. Alternatively, I can just swap the means in the proportion: $p = 5/10$. Both lead to $0.5$."
Final Answer: A

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
"We have $10 = 5/p$. I'll multiply by $p$ to get $10p = 5$. Then I divide by 10, so $p = 5/10$. That simplifies to $1/2$, which is $0.5$. Choice A."
Final Answer: A

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
"The equation is $10 = 5/p$. I'll try to solve it like $10 = p/5$. If it was that, $p$ would be 50. But it's upside down. So if $p/5$ gives 50, then $5/p$ must be the opposite? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me try the options. If $p=0.5$, then $5 / 0.5 = 10$. Oh, that actually works. I thought it would be 2.5, but dividing by a half is multiplying by 2. Cool."
Final Answer: A

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
"I hate fractions. $10 = 5 / p$. To get rid of the fraction, you multiply. $10 \times 5 = 50$. So $p$ is 50. It’s always the multiplication of the two numbers."
Final Answer: B

**Student 10 [ability: proficient]**
"Rearranging $10 = 5/p$... Multiply by $p$ to get $10p = 5$. Divide by 10 to get $p = 0.5$. To check: $5 \div (1/2) = 5 \times 2 = 10$. Correct."
