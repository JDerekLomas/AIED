Okay, let’s see. $8+12$ is $20$. $20$ divided by $4$ is $5$. So the first side is $5$. Now the other side... it has brackets. $8+12$ is $20$ again. Divided by $4$ is $5$. So they are both $5$. They are the same.
Final answer choice: C

**Student 2 [ability: proficient]**
This is an Order of Operations question. For the left side: $8 + 12 \div 4$. Division comes before addition (BODMAS). So, $12 \div 4 = 3$. Then $8 + 3 = 11$.
For the right side: $(8 + 12) \div 4$. Brackets come first. $8 + 12 = 20$. Then $20 \div 4 = 5$.
Comparing them: $11$ is greater than $5$. So, $11 > 5$.
Final answer choice: A

**Student 3 [ability: basic]**
Left side: $8 + 12 = 20$. $20$ divided by $4$ is $5$.
Right side: $(8+12)$ is in brackets, so do that first. $8+12 = 20$. $20 \div 4$ is $5$.
Wait, they look different but I got $5$ for both. Let me re-read. Oh, the first one doesn't have brackets. Does that matter? I usually just go left to right. Yeah, $8+12$ is $20$, then divide by $4$. It’s the same thing.
Final answer choice: C

**Student 4 [ability: advanced]**
I need to evaluate both expressions.
Expression 1: $8 + 12 \div 4$. Following PEMDAS/BIDMAS, division precedes addition. $12 \div 4 = 3$. $8 + 3 = 11$.
Expression 2: $(8 + 12) \div 4$. The parentheses group the addition to happen first. $20 \div 4 = 5$.
Since $11 > 5$, the symbol is $>$.
Final answer choice: A

**Student 5 [ability: basic]**
Left side: $12 \div 4$ is $3$. $8 + 3 = 11$. Okay.
Right side: $8 + 12$ is $20$. $20 \div 4$ is $5$.
Wait, is $11$ bigger or smaller than $5$? The alligator eats the bigger number. So the mouth should open towards the $11$. That’s the "$>$" symbol.
Final answer choice: A

**Student 6 [ability: below_basic]**
$8$ plus $12$ divide $4$... that’s too many numbers. $8+12$ is $20$. $20$ and $4$... maybe it's $24$? No, it's divide. $20 \div 4$ is $5$.
The other side is $(8+12)$ which is $20$, then $\div 4$. That's also $5$.
The question has a $\geq$ thingy. Maybe it's that one because they are equal but look different? No, C is easier.
Final answer choice: C

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
BIDMAS. Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.
Left side: No brackets. $12 \div 4 = 3$. Then $8 + 3 = 11$.
Right side: Brackets. $(8+12) = 20$. Then $20 \div 4 = 5$.
$11$ is bigger than $5$. A is $>$ and B is $<$. I always mix these up. L stands for Less than... so $<$ is Less than. So $11 > 5$ is choice A.
Final answer choice: A

**Student 8 [ability: proficient]**
Left: $8 + (12/4) = 8 + 3 = 11$.
Right: $(8 + 12) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5$.
$11 > 5$. Easy.
Final answer choice: A

**Student 9 [ability: basic]**
$8 + 12 \div 4$. I'll use my calculator. $8 + 12 \div 4$ equals... $11$.
$(8 + 12) \div 4$. My calculator says $5$.
So $11$ and $5$. The first one is bigger. $11$ is greater than $5$. That's the symbol that points to the right. A.
Final answer choice: A

**Student 10 [ability: below_basic]**
$8+12$ is $20$. $20/4$ is $5$.
Then the next part is $(8+12)$... that's $20$. Divide by $4$ is $5$.
I don't get it, they are the same. But D is "greater than or equal to". If they are equal, then D could be right too? This is confusing. I'll just pick C because $5$ equals $5$.
Final answer choice: C
