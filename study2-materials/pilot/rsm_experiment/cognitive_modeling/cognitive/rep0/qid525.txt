### Student 1 [ability: below_basic]
"Okay, plus sum. I just add the numbers across. 2 plus 2 is 4. Then 7 plus 1 is 8 for the top. 10 plus 4 is 14 for the bottom. So it's 4 and 8 over 14. Let me check the options. Oh, D is exactly that. Easy."
**Final Answer: D**

### Student 2 [ability: basic]
"Mixed numbers... I should probably change them to top-heavy fractions first because that's what Mr. Jones said. $10 \times 2$ is 20, plus 7 is 27. So $\frac{27}{10}$. Then $4 \times 2$ is 8, plus 1 is 9. So $\frac{9}{4}$. Now I need a common denominator. 10 and 4... let's use 40. To get 40, I do $27 \times 4$. $20 \times 4 = 80$, $7 \times 4 = 28$, so 108. So $\frac{108}{40}$. For the other one, $9 \times 10 = 90$. So $\frac{90}{40}$. Add them: $108 + 90 = 198$. So $\frac{198}{40}$. Wait, the answers are mixed numbers or smaller fractions. Let me divide 198 by 2... that's 99. And 40 divided by 2 is 20. So $\frac{99}{20}$. That's option A! Wait, the question asks for a mixed number... but A is there. I'll just pick A."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 3 [ability: proficient]
"I’ll add the whole numbers first: $2 + 2 = 4$. Now I just need to solve $\frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4}$. The common denominator for 10 and 4 is 20. For $\frac{7}{10}$, I multiply by 2 to get $\frac{14}{20}$. For $\frac{1}{4}$, I multiply by 5 to get $\frac{5}{20}$. Adding those gives $\frac{19}{20}$. So the total is $4 \frac{19}{20}$. Let me check the list... yep, that's B."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 4 [ability: below_basic]
"Adding fractions. $2 + 2 = 4$. Now 7/10 and 1/4. I remember you can't just add them. You have to... cross multiply? $7 \times 4$ is 28. $10 \times 1$ is 10. $28 + 10 = 38$. And the bottom is $10 \times 4 = 40$. So $4 \frac{38}{40}$. None of the answers look like $4 \frac{38}{40}$. Wait, D is $4 \frac{8}{14}$, maybe I simplify? No. Maybe it's C because it has a 40? I don't know, this is too hard. I'll just guess C."
**Final Answer: C**

### Student 5 [ability: advanced]
"Estimate first: $2.7 + 2.25 = 4.95$. That's almost 5. 
Option A is $99/20 = 4.95$.
Option B is $4 \frac{19}{20} = 4 + 0.95 = 4.95$.
Option C is way too small.
Option D is $4 \frac{8}{14}$, which is about 4.5. 
So it's A or B. The question explicitly says 'Leave your answer as a mixed number'. Even though A and B are equal, B is the mixed number format."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 6 [ability: proficient]
"Convert to improper: $27/10 + 9/4$. 
Common denominator 20: 
$27 \times 2 = 54$. So $54/20$. 
$9 \times 5 = 45$. So $45/20$. 
$54 + 45 = 99$. 
Total is $99/20$. 
Wait, the question asks for a mixed number. How many 20s in 99? 4. $20 \times 4 = 80$. Remainder is 19. 
So $4 \frac{19}{20}$. That is option B."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 7 [ability: basic]
"2 + 2 is 4. Now I need $\frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4}$. I'll just use 40 as the denominator to be safe. 
$7 \times 4 = 28$. $1 \times 10 = 10$. 
$28 + 10 = 38$. 
So $4 \frac{38}{40}$. 
I need to simplify the fraction. Divide by 2... 38 becomes 19 and 40 becomes 20. 
So $4 \frac{19}{20}$. Check the options... it's B."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 8 [ability: below_basic]
"2 + 2 is 4. The fractions are 7/10 and 1/4. $7 + 1 = 8$. $10 + 4 = 14$. 4 and 8/14. D is 4 and 8/14. I remember my teacher saying don't just add the bottom numbers, but it's an option so it must be right. Why would they put it there if it was wrong?"
**Final Answer: D**

### Student 9 [ability: proficient]
"Calculation: $2.7 + 2.25$. 
$0.7 + 0.25 = 0.95$. 
Whole numbers: $2 + 2 = 4$. 
Result is 4.95. 
Converting 0.95 to a fraction: $95/100$. 
Divide by 5: $95 \div 5 = 19$. $100 \div 5 = 20$. 
So $4 \frac{19}{20}$. This matches option B."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 10 [ability: basic]
"$27/10 + 9/4$. 
I'll find a common denominator... let's go with 20. 
$27/10 = 54/20$. 
$9/4 = 45/20$. 
$54 + 45 = 99$. 
So the answer is $99/20$. 
Looking at the options... A is $99/20$. B is $4 \frac{19}{20}$. 
$99 \div 20$... 20, 40, 60, 80... that's 4 with 19 left over. 
Oh, they are the same thing. The question says 'mixed number' though. A is an improper fraction. B is a mixed number. I'll go with B."
**Final Answer: B**
