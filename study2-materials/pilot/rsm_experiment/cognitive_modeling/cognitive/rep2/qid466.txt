"Okay, I have an equation: $-3/4 \times \text{star} = -1$. To isolate the star, I need to divide both sides by $-3/4$. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, star equals $-1 \times (-4/3)$. A negative times a negative is a positive. $1 \times 4/3$ is $4/3$. Let me double-check: $-3/4 \times 4/3$... the 3s cancel, the 4s cancel, I'm left with $-1$. Perfect."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 2 [ability: below_basic]**
"The question has $-3/4$ and then equals $-1$. I think I need to make the fraction disappear to get to $1$. If I have $3/4$, maybe I just need another $3/4$ to make it a whole? No, that’s adding. Um, the star is probably just the same number but positive because it's minus over there? I'll guess C because it's the opposite of the first number."
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 3 [ability: basic]**
"We need the answer to be $-1$. I remember my teacher saying that if you multiply a fraction by its flip, you get 1. So $3/4$ times $4/3$ is $12/12$, which is $1$. The question has a minus sign at the start: $-3/4$. If I multiply by $4/3$, it stays negative because negative times positive is negative. That gives me $-1$. So the star must be $4/3$."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
"$-3/4$ times something equals $-1$. I know that $4/4$ is $1$. How do I get $4/4$? Maybe I just need to flip the fraction. The options are $4/3$ or $-4/3$. If I pick $-4/3$, then two negatives make a positive... wait, $(-3/4) \times (-4/3) = +1$. But the question says it has to be $-1$. So I only need one negative sign in the whole thing. Since the first fraction already has one, the star should be positive. That's $4/3$."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 5 [ability: proficient]**
"This is essentially asking for the reciprocal. The product is $-1$. Let $x$ be the star. $(-3/4)x = -1$. Multiply both sides by $-4$ to get $3x = 4$. Then divide by 3. $x = 4/3$. Just checking the signs: negative times positive is negative. $3/4$ times $4/3$ is $1$. Everything matches."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 6 [ability: below_basic]**
"There's a $-3/4$ and a $-1$. Maybe I subtract them? $-1$ take away $3/4$? No, it's a multiply sign. If I multiply $3/4$ by something to get $1$, maybe it's just the same number? If I put $-3/4$ in the star, $(-3/4) \times (-3/4) = 9/16$. That's not right. I don't know how to get $1$. I'll just pick B because it looks like the most 'complete' change."
**Final Answer: B**

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
"To get $1$, you multiply by the reciprocal. Reciprocal of $3/4$ is $4/3$. Now I need to check the sign. The answer is negative. $-3/4$ is already negative. If I multiply a negative by another negative, I get a positive. But I want it to stay negative. So the star has to be positive $4/3$. Wait, is that A or B? A is positive. Okay."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 8 [ability: proficient]**
"Inverse operations: $\text{star} = -1 \div (-3/4)$. This is the same as $-1 \times (-4/3)$. A negative times a negative is a positive. So the answer is positive $4/3$. If the question had been $-3/4 \times \text{star} = 1$, then the answer would have been $-4/3$. But since it equals $-1$, A is correct."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
"Math with fractions is hard. $-3/4$ times... something equals $-1$. Is it $3/4$? If I have $-3/4$ and I want $-1$, I need a little bit more? I'll just pick D because it's the same as the start and maybe it's a trick question where the star is just '1' but it's not an option. I'll go with D."
**Final Answer: D**

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
"I remember the rule 'flip it to get 1'. So $3/4$ becomes $4/3$. I see $4/3$ in A and $-4/3$ in B. The answer is $-1$. If I use $-4/3$, then $(-3/4) \times (-4/3)$. Two minuses make a plus. $12/12 = 1$. But the question is $-1$. So it can't be two minuses. It must be a minus and a plus. The first one is already minus, so the star is plus. $4/3$."
