### Student 1 [ability: basic]
"Okay, mean means average. I need to add them all up and divide by how many there are. Let's see... 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. That's five numbers. So I need to divide by 5. Option A has a 5 on the bottom. Option C has a 4. So it's not C because you have to count the zero. Now, looking at A... it says 1+3+4+7. Wait, it forgot the 0. But 0 doesn't change the sum when you add it, right? 0+1+3+4+7 is the same as 1+3+4+7. So A looks right because the sum is the same and it divides by 5."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 2 [ability: below_basic]
"Mean... that’s the one where you add them. 0 + 1 is 1, plus 3 is 4, plus 4 is 8, plus 7 is 15. Now I need to divide. There are 1, 2, 3, 4 numbers. I don't count the zero because zero is nothing. So 15 divided by 4. That’s option C. It has all the numbers except the zero and it divides by 4. Easy."
**Final Answer: C**

### Student 3 [ability: advanced]
"To find the mean, I sum the terms and divide by the count $n$. The terms are $\{0, 1, 3, 4, 7\}$, so $n=5$. The expression should be $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$. Looking at the options: A is $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$. Since $0$ is the additive identity, $0+1+3+4+7 = 1+3+4+7$. Thus, the numerator in A is correct, and the denominator is 5, which is the correct count. Option B is incorrect due to order of operations ($7 \div 5$ happens first). Option C has the wrong denominator. So A is mathematically equivalent to the correct formula."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 4 [ability: proficient]
"Mean is sum divided by count. Sum is $0+1+3+4+7 = 15$. Count is 5. So $15/5 = 3$. 
Option A: $(1+3+4+7)/5 = 15/5 = 3$. This works.
Option B: $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. Wait, BIDMAS. You do $7 \div 5$ first, then add the others. That's not right.
Option C: $15/4$. That’s wrong because there are five numbers in the list.
Wait, let me double check A. Does it need the 0? $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$ is the same as $1 + 3 + 4 + 7$. So A is definitely the right calculation."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 5 [ability: below_basic]
"The question is asking for the mean. I remember my teacher saying you just add them up and divide. $0+1+3+4+7$ divide by 5. Option B looks exactly like what I just said. $0+1+3+4+7$ and then a divide 5 at the end. I’ll pick B."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 6 [ability: basic]
"Total numbers: 5. 
A: Has 1, 3, 4, 7. That's only four numbers on top, but a 5 on the bottom. That's weird.
B: Has all the numbers and a divide 5. That looks better.
C: Has four numbers and a divide 4.
I think if you have 5 numbers, you must have all 5 in the sum. But A is missing the zero. If you miss the zero, you should divide by 4. If you keep the zero, you divide by 5. None of these look perfect, but B has all the numbers listed and the 5."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 7 [ability: basic]
"Add them up: $0+1+3+4+7 = 15$. 
There are 5 numbers, so $15 \div 5 = 3$. 
A: $(1+3+4+7) = 15$, then divide by $5 = 3$.
B: $0+1+3+4+ (7 \div 5)$... no, that's not how a calculator does it if you just type it in. 
C: $15 \div 4 = 3.75$.
A works out to the right answer, even though the 0 isn't written there. I'll go with A."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 8 [ability: below_basic]
"Mean is middle? No, that's median. Mean is... I don't know. Let's just look at the numbers. $0, 1, 3, 4, 7$. There's five numbers. The divide sign is a line or a dot-line-dot. Option B has the dot-line-dot. Option A and C have the line. My primary school teacher used the B one more. I'll pick B."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 9 [ability: proficient]
"The formula for the mean is $\frac{\sum x}{n}$. 
Here, $\sum x = 0+1+3+4+7 = 15$ and $n = 5$. 
Checking A: $(1+3+4+7)/5$. The sum of $\{1,3,4,7\}$ is 15. So $15/5 = 3$. This is correct.
Checking B: $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$. Without brackets, only the 7 is divided by 5. That's wrong.
Checking C: $(1+3+4+7)/4 = 15/4$. This assumes there are only 4 numbers, but 0 counts as a data point. 
A is the only one that is numerically correct."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 10 [ability: basic]
"Okay, mean of 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. 
A has a 5 at the bottom.
B has a 5 at the end.
C has a 4 at the bottom.
I'm stuck between A and B. A is missing the zero. B has the zero. The rule is you must include all numbers in the sum. So A must be wrong because it's missing the 0. B has everything. I'll pick B."
**Final Answer: B**
