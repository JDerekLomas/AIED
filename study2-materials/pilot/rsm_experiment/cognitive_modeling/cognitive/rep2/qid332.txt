"Okay, let's look at the equation: $x/3 - 5 = 12$. 
Tom wants to move the -5 first. To undo -5, you add 5 to both sides. $12 + 5 = 17$, so $x/3 = 17$. Tom is correct.
Katie wants to deal with the fraction first. If you multiply the whole equation by 3 to get rid of the $/3$, you have to multiply *every* term. So it should be $x - 15 = 36$. Katie just multiplied the $x/3$ and the $12$, but she forgot to multiply the $-5$. So her line $x - 5 = 36$ is wrong because the $-5$ didn't change. 
Therefore, only Tom is right."
**Final Choice: A**

**Student 2 [ability: proficient]**
"Looking at $x/3 - 5 = 12$. 
If I add 5 to both sides, I get $x/3 = 17$. That matches what Tom said. 
If I want to do what Katie did and get $x$ on its own, I'd multiply by 3. $3 \times (x/3) = x$. $3 \times 12 = 36$. But wait, does the 5 change? In class, the teacher says 'do the same to everything'. If I multiply by 3, the 5 becomes 15. Katie's line is $x - 5 = 36$, but it should be $x - 15 = 36$. So Katie is wrong. Tom's way is the normal way anyway."
**Final Choice: A**

**Student 3 [ability: basic]**
"Tom says $x/3 = 17$. He got that by doing $12 + 5$. That makes sense because you move the minus 5 over and it becomes a plus. So Tom is definitely right.
Katie says $x - 5 = 36$. She got the 36 by doing $12 \times 3$. That also makes sense because the opposite of divide 3 is multiply 3. If she multiplied the 12 by 3, she's doing the opposite operation. It looks like they are just doing the two different steps first. One moves the 5, one moves the 3. They both look like standard moves."
**Final Choice: C**

**Student 4 [ability: below_basic]**
"The equation is $x/3 - 5 = 12$. 
Tom has $17$. $12 + 5 = 17$. That's correct. 
Katie has $36$. $12 \times 3 = 36$. That's also correct. 
I don't know which one is better, but the numbers work out from the numbers in the question. If both numbers are right, they are probably both right."
**Final Choice: C**

**Student 5 [ability: proficient]**
"Tom’s step: $\frac{x}{3} = 17$. He added 5 to both sides. $12 + 5 = 17$. This is a perfectly valid first step.
Katie’s step: $x - 5 = 36$. To get this, she multiplied by 3. But when you multiply an equation by a number, you have to multiply every single term. It should be $3(\frac{x}{3}) - 3(5) = 3(12)$, which is $x - 15 = 36$. She forgot to multiply the 5 by 3. So Katie is incorrect."
**Final Choice: A**

**Student 6 [ability: basic]**
"If I solve it: 
$x/3 - 5 = 12$
$x/3 = 17$ (plus 5)
$x = 17 \times 3 = 51$. 
Tom's line is exactly what I wrote for my first step. 
Katie says $x - 5 = 36$. If $x = 51$, then $51 - 5 = 46$. But Katie's line says it should be 36. So $46$ doesn't equal $36$. That means Katie's line must be wrong because it doesn't work with the answer."
**Final Choice: A**

**Student 7 [ability: below_basic]**
"I hate fractions. $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$. 
Tom says 17. Maybe he did $12 + 5$. 
Katie says 36. She did $12 \times 3$. 
Usually, in these questions, they show two different ways to do it and both people are right because maths has different ways. I'll guess C."
**Final Choice: C**

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
"Tom is correct because $12 + 5 = 17$.
Katie says $x - 5 = 36$. To get $x$, you have to get rid of the divide by 3. $12 \times 3 = 36$. 
But wait, if she multiplied the 12 by 3 to get 36, did she do it to the $x$ part? $x/3$ times 3 is $x$. So $x$ and 36 are there. But the 5 is still there. 
Wait, if you multiply one side by 3 you have to do the whole side. I remember the 'rainbow' thing for brackets. You'd have to do $3 \times (x/3 - 5)$. That would be $x - 15$. 
So Katie's $x-5$ is wrong. It should be $x-15$.
Actually, is that right? Let me re-think... yeah, if you multiply, you do everything. Only Tom followed the rules."
**Final Choice: A**

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
"I don't know. $x/3 - 5 = 12$. 
$12 - 5 = 7$. None of them have 7. 
$12 + 3 = 15$. None of them have 15. 
Maybe B? 36 seems like a big number, maybe Katie knows a trick."
**Final Choice: B**

**Student 10 [ability: advanced]**
"Equation: $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$. 
Tom: $\frac{x}{3} = 17$ (Result of adding 5 to both sides). Correct.
Katie: $x - 5 = 36$. This is a common error where the student multiplies only the terms they 'want' to change by the denominator, rather than the entire side. For this to be a 'correct next line', it must be an equivalent equation. 
$x/3 - 5 = 12 \implies x - 15 = 36$.
Katie's line is not equivalent to the original equation. Only Tom is correct."
