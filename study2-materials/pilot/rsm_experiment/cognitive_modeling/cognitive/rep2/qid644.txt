**Student 1 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: Okay, arrows. They are pointing at the 1 and the 4. The question says "multiplies," but sometimes I get confused if it's adding because there are minus signs. If I have -1 and -4, and I put them together, it makes -5. Like if I owe a pound and then I owe four more pounds. That's one of the options.
Answer: D

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Molly is doing FOIL. First, Outer, Inner, Last. The arrows are pointing at the last number in each bracket. So that’s -1 and -4. I need to multiply them. 1 times 4 is 4. Now I have to remember the sign rule. A minus and a minus... my teacher said two negatives make a positive. So it should be +4.
Answer: A

**Student 3 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: The arrows are on -1 and -4. Multiply means times. $1 \times 4 = 4$. It’s got a minus sign in front of both, so the answer must be negative because there are minuses there. It’s -4.
Answer: B

**Student 4 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: Expanding brackets $(2p - 1)(3p - 4)$. The arrows indicate the multiplication of the constant terms: $-1$ and $-4$. Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product. $1 \times 4 = 4$, so $(-1) \times (-4) = +4$.
Answer: A

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: I hate algebra. The arrows are at 1 and 4. $1 + 4$ is 5. It says multiply? $1 \times 4$ is 4. But wait, it's minus 1 and minus 4. Is it $1 - 4$? That's -3, but that's not an option. Let's just go with 5 because it's C or D. It looks like it should be 5.
Answer: C

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: This is the 'Last' term in the FOIL expansion. We are multiplying the scalar constants including their signs. Therefore: $(-1) \times (-4)$. Negative times negative equals positive. $1 \times 4 = 4$. Result is $+4$. 
Answer: A

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Multiplying the two numbers. 1 times 4. That is 4. There is a minus in front of the 4, so it’s -4. The 1 has a minus too... I think it stays negative. B.
Answer: B

**Student 8 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: The arrows point to $-1$ and $-4$. The instruction is to multiply. $(-1) \times (-4) = 4$. Looking at the options, $A$ is $+4$ and $B$ is $-4$. Since it's a negative times a negative, it must be positive.
Answer: A

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: I see -1 and -4. $1 + 4 = 5$. Since they are both minuses, it's $-5$. My friend told me when you see two negatives you add them up. 
Answer: D

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Expanding $(2p-1)(3p-4)$. The arrows are the last two. $-1 \times -4$. $1 \times 4 = 4$. My calculator would say $+4$ if I put it in. Two negatives cancel out.
