"Okay, it’s an equation. I see a 10, a 5, and a $p$. I need to find $p$. $10 = 5 \div p$. If I do 10 times 5, I get 50. That looks like a big number that fits. Let's see... if $p$ is 50, then 10 equals 5 divided by 50. No, wait, $5 \times 10$ is 50. I’ll just go with 50 because it's one of the options and I always multiply when I see a fraction."
**Final Answer: B**

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
"Ten equals five over $p$. I need to get $p$ by itself. If I move the 5 to the other side, it becomes a divide? No, it’s already dividing. I’ll move the 10. $p = 10 \div 5$. Ten divided by five is two. That makes sense. $p=2$."
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
"The equation is $10 = 5/p$. I need to multiply both sides by $p$ to get it out of the denominator. So, $10p = 5$. Now I divide both sides by 10 to isolate $p$. $p = 5 / 10$. Five tenths is the same as one half, which is 0.5. Let me check: 5 divided by 0.5 is 10. Yep."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
"I remember a triangle trick for these. If $10 = 5/p$, then $p$ and 10 can swap places. So $p = 10/5$. $10 \div 5 = 2$. My teacher said always check if the numbers look right. 10, 5, 2... yeah, $10/5$ is 2. Wait, the question is $5/p$. Is $5/2$ equal to 10? No, that’s 2.5. But 2 is a choice and I don't know what else to do."
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
"There is no way to get 10 from 5 unless you add 5. But there is no plus sign. Maybe there's no solution? I don't like fractions. If I put 0.5 in there, 5 divided by 0.5... my calculator is in my bag... I think it's 2.5. None of these feel right. I'll just guess 50 because 10 times 5 is 50."
**Final Answer: B**

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
"Equation: $10 = 5/p$. This is a simple reciprocal relationship. $p$ must be $5/10$. Simplifying the fraction $5/10$ gives $1/2$, which is $0.5$ in decimal form. Checking the work: $5 / 0.5$ is equivalent to $50 / 5$, which is 10. The answer is A."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
"I'll multiply by $p$ first. $10 \times p = 5$. To get $p$, I divide 5 by 10. $p = 5/10$. That's 0.5. I almost chose 2 because I usually do big number divided by small number, but the 10 is on the other side. $p = 0.5$."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
"$10 = 5/p$. I'll try to plug in the numbers. If $p=0.5$, $5 \div 0.5$ is... uh... 2.5? No, that's $5 \times 0.5$. If $p=50$, $5/50$ is $0.1$. If $p=2$, $5/2$ is $2.5$. None of these are 10. Wait, maybe I'm dividing wrong. $5 \div 0.5$ is like how many halves are in 5? There are 10 halves in 5. Oh! It is A."
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
"$10 = 5/p$. $p$ is at the bottom. $5$ divided by something is $10$. That's impossible, you can't divide 5 and get a bigger number like 10. It has to be 2 because 10 divided by 5 is 2. But the 5 is on top. This is confusing. I'll just pick C because it's a whole number."
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
"I'll just rearrange it. $10 \times p = 5$. So $p = 10 \div 5$. Wait, no, $p = 5 \div 10$. My brain is tired. $5$ divided by $10$ is $0.5$. I was going to pick 50 but $5/50$ is definitely not 10. Let me double check... $5 \div 0.5$... if I have 5 pizzas and cut them into halves, I have 10 pieces. Yeah, that's it."
**Final Answer: A**
