### Student 1 [ability: advanced]
"Okay, order of operations. Multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. So, I’ll do $4 \times 2$ first, which is $8$. Now the expression is $3 - 5 + 8$. Since addition and subtraction have the same priority, I go from left to right. $3 - 5$ is $-2$. Then $-2 + 8$ is $6$. Checking my work: $3 - 5 = -2$; $-2 + 8 = 6$. Looks solid."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 2 [ability: below_basic]
"Alright, $3$ take away $5$ is... wait, you can't do $3 - 5$. It must be $5 - 3$, which is $2$. Then plus $4$ is $6$. Then $6$ times $2$ is $12$. Is $12$ there? No. Maybe it's $3 - 5$ is $-2$, then $-2 + 4$ is $2$, then $2 \times 2$ is $4$. Yeah, $4$ is an option. I'll go with that."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 3 [ability: proficient]
"BODMAS. No brackets, no orders. Multiplication is first. $4 \times 2 = 8$. Now I have $3 - 5 + 8$. Let’s do the addition: $5 + 8 = 13$. Then $3 - 13 = -10$. Wait, is it $(3 - 5) + 8$ or $3 - (5 + 8)$? The sign belongs to the $5$, so it's $-5 + 8$, which is $3$. $3 + 3 = 6$. Yeah, left to right for addition and subtraction. $3-5$ is $-2$, then plus $8$ is $6$."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 4 [ability: basic]
"BIDMAS. Multiplication first: $4 \times 2 = 8$. Now I have $3 - 5 + 8$. Addition is next because 'A' comes before 'S'. So $5 + 8 = 13$. Then I have $3 - 13$. That's $-10$. Let me check the options... okay, $-10$ is D. I always remember that addition comes before subtraction."
**Final Answer: D**

### Student 5 [ability: below_basic]
"Three minus five plus four... that's $3$ minus $5$ is $2$. Plus $4$ is $6$. Times $2$ is $12$. Wait, there's no $12$. Let me try the other way. $4$ times $2$ is $8$. Plus $5$ is $13$. $3$ minus $13$ is $-10$. That's there. I think I just do it backwards? $2 \times 4 = 8$, $8 + 5 = 13$, $13 - 3 = 10$. But there's a minus $10$. I'll pick D."
**Final Answer: D**

### Student 6 [ability: basic]
"Left to right: $3 - 5 = -2$. Then $-2 + 4 = 2$. Then $2 \times 2 = 4$. My teacher says always follow the order it's written in. $3... -5... +4... \times 2$. Yep, that's $4$."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 7 [ability: proficient]
"Order of operations. Multiplications first: $4 \times 2 = 8$. The equation is $3 - 5 + 8$. Now I just solve it left to right. $3 - 5$ is $-2$. $-2 + 8$ is the same as $8 - 2$, so $6$. Answer A. Let me just double check if I do the addition first. $5+8$ is $13$, $3-13$ is $-10$. But the minus is attached to the $5$... so it should be $-5 + 8$. Yeah, it’s $6$."
**Final Answer: A**

### Student 8 [ability: basic]
"Okay, $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$. Multiply first: $4 \times 2 = 8$. Then it's $3 - 5 + 8$. Addition comes next in PEMDAS. $5 + 8 = 13$. $3 - 13 = -10$. I always get confused with the negative numbers but $-10$ is one of the answers so it must be right."
**Final Answer: D**

### Student 9 [ability: below_basic]
"Uh, I don't like minus numbers. $3$ take $5$ is $-2$. Then $4 \times 2$ is $8$. $-2 + 8$... I'll just do $2 + 4 + 2$? No. Let's see... $3 - 5$ is $-2$. $-2 + 4$ is $2$. $2 \times 2$ is $4$. I'll go with B. B is a safe bet."
**Final Answer: B**

### Student 10 [ability: advanced]
"The expression is $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$. According to standard order of operations, I perform the multiplication first. $4 \times 2 = 8$. The expression simplifies to $3 - 5 + 8$. Next, addition and subtraction are performed with equal priority from left to right. $3 - 5 = -2$. Then $-2 + 8 = 6$. Choice A."
**Final Answer: A**
