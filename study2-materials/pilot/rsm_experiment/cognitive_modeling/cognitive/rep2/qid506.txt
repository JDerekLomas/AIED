**Student 1 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: "Okay, I need to find $p$. There is a 3 and a 12. $12 \div 3$ is 4. Looking at the options... option A has a 4 in it, and option C is just 4. The 12 is on the bottom, so maybe the 4 should be on the bottom too? $3 \times 4 = 12$, so it must be 1/4."
Final Answer: A

**Student 2 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: "I have $3p = 1/12$. To solve for $p$, I need to divide both sides by 3. Dividing a fraction by a whole number is the same as multiplying the denominator by that number. So, $p = 1 / (12 \times 3)$. $12 \times 3 = 36$. Therefore, $p = 1/36$."
Final Answer: B

**Student 3 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: "3 times $p$ equals 1/12. If it was $3p = 12$, $p$ would be 4. But it's a fraction. I'll just move the 3 over and multiply? No, wait, if I divide 12 by 3 I get 4. The answer must be 1/4 because the 12 is already in a fraction. That looks right."
Final Answer: A

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: "To get $p$ by itself, I need to get rid of the 3. Since it's $3 \times p$, I do the opposite and divide. $1/12 \div 3$. Okay, $1/12 \div 3/1$. To divide fractions, you flip the second one and multiply. $1/12 \times 1/3$. $1 \times 1 = 1$ and $12 \times 3 = 36$. Oh, that's option B."
Final Answer: B

**Student 5 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: "Standard linear equation. $3p = 1/12$. Multiply both sides by 12 to get rid of the fraction first? $36p = 1$. Now divide by 36. $p = 1/36$. Let me double-check. $3 \times (1/36) = 3/36$. Divide top and bottom by 3... $1/12$. Matches. Correct."
Final Answer: B

**Student 6 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: "$3p$ means 3 and $p$. To get $p$ I need to move the 3. $3 \times 12$ is 36. No, wait, the 3 is next to the $p$, so I should do $12/3$. That is 4. The question is a fraction though. Is it 4 or 1/4? Let's go with 4 because it's a whole number and easier."
Final Answer: C

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: "Divide by 3. $p = (1/12) / 3$. This is the same as $1/12 \times 1/3$. $1 \times 1 = 1$, $12 \times 3 = 36$. Result is 1/36. This is a common trap where people accidentally multiply the 12 by 3 or divide the 12 by 3. But I'm sure it's 1/36."
Final Answer: B

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: "If $3p = 1/12$, then $p$ must be $1/12$ divided by 3. I'll just do 12 divided by 3 on my calculator... that's 4. So the answer is 1/4. I don't think it's 1/36, that number seems too small to be right for a Year 9 question."
Final Answer: A

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: "3... 12... p. $12 - 3 = 9$. There is a $1/9$ there. Maybe that's it? I don't know how to do fractions. 12 divided by 3 is 4... but 9 is also there. Let's just pick D."
Final Answer: D

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: "$3p = 1/12$. I need to isolate $p$. I'll divide by 3. $1/12$ divided by 3... wait, if I have a twelfth of a cake and I divide it into 3 pieces, each piece is even smaller. So it can't be 1/4 because 1/4 is bigger than 1/12. It must be 1/36."
