**Student 1 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: Okay, look at Problem P first. It's $4-5+6$. You just go from left to right, surely? So $4-5$ comes first. Now for Problem Q. It’s $4+5 \times 6$. My teacher said always do the adding before the multiplying if it comes first in the line? No, wait... or is it the other way? Let's just go left to right again. $4+5$ is first in the sentence, so you do that.
Final Answer Choice: A

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: BIDMAS. I remember the acronym. B-I-D-M-A-S. Addition comes before Subtraction because A is before S. So for Problem P, I should do the plus bit first, which is $5+6$. For Problem Q, Multiplication (M) comes before Addition (A). So $5 \times 6$ is first. That would be... P is $5+6$ and Q is $5 \times 6$. That's option D.
Final Answer Choice: D

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: In Problem P, we have subtraction and addition. According to BIDMAS, addition and subtraction have equal priority, so you just work from left to right. That means $4-5$ comes first. In Problem Q, we have addition and multiplication. Multiplication definitely has higher priority than addition. So $5 \times 6$ comes first there. So it's $4-5$ then $5 \times 6$.
Final Answer Choice: B

**Student 4 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: For Problem P, addition and subtraction are inverse operations with the same precedence. You evaluate from left to right to maintain the correct signs (otherwise you might accidentally treat it as $4 - (5+6)$ which is wrong). So, $4-5$ is first. For Problem Q, order of operations dictates that multiplication happens before addition. So $5 \times 6$ is first.
Final Answer Choice: B

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: I hate maths. Problem P: $4-5+6$. Um, $5+6$ is easier to do than $4-5$, so I'll do that. Problem Q: $4+5$ is $9$, then $9$ times $6$... yeah, that makes sense. So $5+6$ for the first one and $4+5$ for the second one. That’s Choice C.
Final Answer Choice: C

**Student 6 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: BODMAS. Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction. For Problem P, A is before S, so do $5+6$ first. For Problem Q, M is before A, so do $5 \times 6$ first. Easy. Wait, looking at the options... $5+6$ and $5 \times 6$ is D.
Final Answer Choice: D

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: Problem P: $4-5+6$. Addition and subtraction are on the same level, so I just go start to finish. $4-5$ is the first step. Problem Q: $4+5 \times 6$. Multiplication is higher up the order than addition. I have to do $5 \times 6$ before I add the 4. So P is $4-5$ and Q is $5 \times 6$.
Final Answer Choice: B

**Student 8 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $4$ minus $5$ plus $6$. You can't do $4$ minus $5$ because $5$ is bigger than $4$. So you have to do $5+6$ first to get $11$, then maybe take away the $4$? No, that's not right. Let's look at Q. $4+5 \times 6$. My tutor said multiply first. So $5 \times 6$. Back to P... if I can't do $4-5$, I'll just guess $5+6$ is first. D seems like a good guess.
Final Answer Choice: D

**Student 9 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Okay, Problem P is $4-5+6$. I remember the teacher saying that for plus and minus it doesn't matter, but usually we just go left to right. So $4-5$. Problem Q: $4+5 \times 6$. Oh, I know this one, the calculator does it differently if you don't use the rule. Multiplication first! So $5 \times 6$. P: $4-5$, Q: $5 \times 6$. This is B.
Final Answer Choice: B

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: PEMDAS. Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction. For Problem P, Addition is before Subtraction, so $5+6$. For Problem Q, Multiplication is before Addition, so $5 \times 6$. Choice D.
Final Answer Choice: D
