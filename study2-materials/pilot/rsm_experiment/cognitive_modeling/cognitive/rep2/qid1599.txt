### Student 1 [ability: basic]
"Okay, division in algebra. I remember the teacher saying we don't use the divide sign anymore. It turns into a fraction. The first letter goes on top and the rest goes on the bottom. So $c$ is on top and $h+4$ is on the bottom. That looks like option A. Wait, let me check D. No, D has $c$ on the bottom, that's upside down. It's definitely A."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 2 [ability: below_basic]
"Division... okay. $c \div h + 4$. There's a $c$ and an $h$ and a $4$. Looking at the options. B has an extra $+4$ on top, that's weird. C has $c$ over $h$ then a $+4$ on the side. That looks right because the $c$ and $h$ are being divided first? The brackets mean something though. I'll just pick C because it looks like how I'd write it on a calculator."
**Final answer choice: C**

### Student 3 [ability: proficient]
"The expression is $c$ divided by the quantity $(h+4)$. In algebra, the vinculum (the fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol. So, $c$ is the numerator and the entire expression in the brackets, $h+4$, must be the denominator. Option A shows exactly that. B adds a 4 where it shouldn't be, C doesn't divide by the 4, and D has the reciprocal."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 4 [ability: advanced]
"The operation is $c \div (h+4)$. Conventionally, division is written in fraction form. The dividend $c$ becomes the numerator and the divisor $(h+4)$ becomes the denominator. The brackets are implied by the fraction bar, so we don't need them in the final form $\frac{c}{h+4}$. This is clearly A."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 5 [ability: basic]
"Dividing $c$ by $h+4$. I know that the divide sign means a fraction. So it's $c$ over $h+4$. Looking at the answers... A is $\frac{c}{h+4}$. D is $\frac{h+4}{c}$. I can never remember which one goes on top. 'C divided by'... if I have 10 divided by 2, that's $10/2$, so the first number is on top. So $c$ is on top. A it is."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 6 [ability: below_basic]
"I hate algebra. $c \div (h+4)$. There's a $c$ and an $h$ and a $4$. Maybe I have to do $c$ divided by $h$ and $c$ divided by $4$? That’s not an option. B has $\frac{c+4}{h+4}$, maybe the $+4$ moves to the top too because it’s in brackets? That looks more 'mathsy'. I'll guess B."
**Final answer choice: B**

### Student 7 [ability: proficient]
"Standard algebraic notation replaces the $\div$ symbol with a fraction bar. The term following the $\div$ sign is $(h+4)$, which means the whole group is the divisor. Therefore, $h+4$ goes under the bar. Choice A is the only one that represents $c$ divided by the sum of $h$ and $4$ correctly."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 8 [ability: basic]
"$c \div (h+4)$. Okay, it's a fraction. $c$ over $h$ and then... the $+4$ is there too. Is it C or A? In C, the $+4$ is separate. But the brackets in the question mean the $+4$ is part of the division. If it’s part of the division, it should be under the line with the $h$. So it's A."
**Final answer choice: A**

### Student 9 [ability: below_basic]
"Which one looks right? $c \div h$ plus $4$. If I just ignore the brackets, it's $c$ divided by $h$, then add $4$. That would be $\frac{c}{h} + 4$. That’s option C. I don't think the brackets do much anyway, we usually just go left to right. I’ll go with C."
**Final answer choice: C**

### Student 10 [ability: basic]
"Divide means a fraction. $c$ is first, so it's on top. $h$ and $4$ are second. Let's see. A is $c$ over $h+4$. D is $h+4$ over $c$. I think it's D because $h+4$ is bigger? No, that’s not right. The first thing stays on top. Okay, let's go with A. Wait, could it be B? No, where did the other $4$ come from? A."
**Final answer choice: A**
