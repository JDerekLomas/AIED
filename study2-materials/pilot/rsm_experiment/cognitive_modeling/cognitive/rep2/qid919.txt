Okay, so $y = 3x^2$ and $x$ is $0.3$. I need to plug it in. So that’s $3$ times $0.3$ squared. $0.3$ squared is $0.3 \times 0.3$. $3 \times 3$ is $9$, so $0.3 \times 0.3$ must be $0.9$. Then I do $3 \times 0.9$. $3 \times 9$ is $27$, so it's $2.7$. That’s an option.
**Final Answer: D**

**Student 2 [ability: below_basic]**
The equation is $3x$ squared. $x$ is $0.3$. I’ll just do $3$ times $0.3$ first. $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. Now I square that? $0.9 \times 0.9 = 0.81$. Yes, that's option A.
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
$y = 3x^2$ where $x = 0.3$. Following BIDMAS, I have to square $x$ before multiplying by $3$. $0.3^2 = 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$. Now I multiply that by $3$. $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. Let me check the options. B is $0.27$.
**Final Answer: B**

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
$3 \times 0.3$ squared. $0.3$ squared is $0.6$ because $0.3 + 0.3$ is $0.6$... wait, no, it's times. $0.3 \times 0.3$. $3 \times 3$ is $9$. Is it $0.9$ or $0.09$? I think it's $0.9$. Then $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$.
**Final Answer: D**

**Student 5 [ability: advanced]**
Substitute $x = 0.3$ into $y = 3x^2$. 
$y = 3(0.3)^2$
Order of operations: Powers first. $(0.3)^2 = 0.09$ (since $3/10 \times 3/10 = 9/100$).
Then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. 
Matches option B.
**Final Answer: B**

**Student 6 [ability: below_basic]**
$y = 3x^2$. $x$ is $0.3$. So $3$ times $0.3$ and then there is a $2$. $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. Then times $2$? $0.9 \times 2 = 1.8$. That's option C. 
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
$y = 3(0.3)^2$. 
First: $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$. 
Second: $3 \times 0.09$. 
$3 \times 9 = 27$. Since there are two decimal places in $0.09$, the answer must be $0.27$.
**Final Answer: B**

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
Square $0.3$. That's $0.9$. Multiply by $3$. $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$. I always get confused with the decimals but $2.7$ is right there in the list, so it must be right.
**Final Answer: D**

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
$3$ times $0.3 \dots$ okay $0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.9$. Then it has a little $2$. Maybe I just add $2$? No, that’s not an option. $0.9$ squared? $0.9 \times 0.9$ is $0.81$. I'll go with A.
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
$y = 3x^2$. 
If $x$ is $0.3$, $x^2$ is $0.3 \times 0.3$. 
I'll use my fingers... $3 \times 3$ is $9$, two decimal spots makes it $0.09$. 
Now $3 \times 0.09$. 
$0.09 + 0.09 = 0.18$. 
$0.18 + 0.09 = 0.27$.
Oh, I actually got to one of the answers. It's B.
**Final Answer: B**
