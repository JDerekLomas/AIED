Okay, so the equation is $10x - 6y = 30$. I have the $y$ value, which is $0.5$, and I need to find the $x$ value (the star).
I’ll put $0.5$ in for $y$.
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
Half of $6$ is $3$, so $10x - 3 = 30$.
Now I need to move the $3$. It’s minus $3$, so I add $3$ to $30$.
$10x = 33$.
To get $x$, I divide by $10$.
$33 \div 10$ is $3.3$.
**Final Answer: C**

$10x$ and $6y$. The table has $y = 0.5$.
So $10 - 6$ is $4$.
Wait, the $y$ is $0.5$. So maybe I do $30 \div 6$? No.
Maybe I just add them? $10 + 6 = 16$. No.
Let me try $10 \times 0.5$. That is $5$.
Then $5 - 6y = 30$? No, the $0.5$ is $y$.
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$.
$10x - 6.5 = 30$.
$10x = 36.5$.
$x = 3.65$. That's not an option.
Let me look at the choices. $3.3$ looks close to $3.65$. I'll pick that.
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
Equation: $10x - 6y = 30$.
Given $y = 0.5$, substitute into the equation:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
Add $3$ to both sides:
$10x = 33$
Divide by $10$:
$x = 3.3$
The star is $x$, so it's $3.3$.
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
$10x - 6y = 30$. $y$ is $0.5$.
$10x - 6 \times 0.5 = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
Now I subtract $3$ from $30$ because there's a minus there?
$10x = 27$
$x = 27 / 10 = 2.7$.
Yeah, $2.7$ is one of the answers.
**Final Answer: D**

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
I hate algebra. $10x - 6y = 30$.
If $y$ is $0.5$, maybe $x$ is just $30$ divided by $10$?
$30 / 10 = 3$.
$3$ isn't there, but $3.3$ is.
Or maybe I do $30 + 12.5$? No.
What if I put $x = 4.25$ in?
$10 \times 4.25 = 42.5$.
$42.5$ minus something is $30$.
$42.5 - 30 = 12.5$.
Is $6 \times 0.5 = 12.5$? No, it's $3$.
This is too hard, I'll just guess A because it's the first one.
**Final Answer: A**

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
We are looking for the $x$-value when $y = 0.5$.
$10x - 6(1/2) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 33/10 = 3.3$.
Easy substitution and linear equation solving.
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
$10x - 6y = 30$. Table shows $y = 0.5$.
Substitute $y$: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$.
Matches option C.
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
$10x - 6y = 30$.
$y = 0.5$
$10x - 6 \times 0.5 = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$.
Checking: $10(3.3) = 33$. $6(0.5) = 3$. $33 - 3 = 30$. Correct.
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
Is the star $x$ or $y$? It's next to $x$, so it's $x$.
$10x - 6 \times 0.5 = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
I'll move the $10$ first? $x - 3 = 30 - 10$?
$x - 3 = 20$.
$x = 23$. Not an option.
Let's try again. $10x = 30 + 3$ maybe? No, that's $33$.
If $x$ is $4.25$... $10 \times 4.25$ is $42.5$.
$42.5$ minus $6 \times 0.5$ which is $3$... $42.5 - 3 = 39.5$. No.
What if it's $30 - 6$? $24$. $24 \div 10 = 2.4$. Not there.
I'll just pick C because everyone else seems to be getting $3$-something.
**Final Answer: C**

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
Add $3$: $10x = 33$
$x = 33/10 = 3.3$.
Wait, did I do the sign right?
If it was $10x + 3 = 30$, then $10x = 27$ and $x = 2.7$.
The equation says $-6y$. $y$ is positive $0.5$. So it stays minus.
$10x - 3 = 30$. So $10x = 33$.
Okay, $3.3$ it is.
