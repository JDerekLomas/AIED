**Student 1 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: Okay, adding fractions. The numbers at the front are 2 and 2, so that’s 4. Now I just add the top numbers and the bottom numbers. 7 plus 1 is 8. 10 plus 4 is 14. So it’s 4 and 8 over 14. That looks like one of the answers. I don’t think I need to do the common denominator thing, that's too hard.
Final Answer: D

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: I need to add $2 \frac{7}{10}$ and $2 \frac{1}{4}$. I'll add the whole numbers first: $2 + 2 = 4$. Now for the fractions: $7/10 + 1/4$. I need a common denominator. 10 times 4 is 40. So $7/10$ becomes $28/40$ and $1/4$ becomes $10/40$. $28 + 10 = 38$. So the answer is $4 \frac{38}{40}$. Wait, that’s not an option. Let me check the options... A and C are improper fractions. Let me turn mine into an improper fraction. $4 \times 40 = 160$, plus 38 is $198/40$. Divide by 2... $99/20$. Oh, that’s option A! But the question asks for a mixed number. If $99/20$ is an option, let me see if I can turn it back. $99 \div 20$ is 4 with 19 left over. $4 \frac{19}{20}$. That’s B.
Final Answer: B

**Student 3 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: First, I’ll turn them into top-heavy fractions. $2 \times 10 + 7 = 27/10$. $2 \times 4 + 1 = 9/4$. Now I add $27/10 + 9/4$. I'll use 20 as the bottom number. For $27/10$, I double it: $54/20$. For $9/4$, I multiply by 5: $45/20$. $54 + 45 = 99$. So $99/20$. The question says leave it as a mixed number, but $99/20$ is right there as option A. I'll just pick A because it matches my math exactly.
Final Answer: A

**Student 4 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: $2 \frac{7}{10} + 2 \frac{1}{4}$. Whole numbers: $2+2=4$. Fractions: $7/10 + 1/4$. LCD is 20. $7/10$ is $14/20$. $1/4$ is $5/20$. Add them: $14+5 = 19$. So it's $19/20$. Put it together with the 4: $4 \frac{19}{20}$. Let me double check... $14/20$ is $0.7$, $5/20$ is $0.25$. $0.7 + 0.25 = 0.95$. $19/20$ is $0.95$. Correct. Matches B.
Final Answer: B

**Student 5 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $2 \frac{7}{10}$ plus $2 \frac{1}{4}$... so that's $2.7$ and... I don't know what $1/4$ is. Is it $0.4$? No, $1/4$ is like a quarter, so $0.25$. $2.7 + 2.25$. $2+2$ is 4. $0.7 + 0.25$... is that $0.32$? No. $70$ plus $25$ is $95$. So $4.95$. Which fraction is $4.95$? $99/40$ is way too small. $99/20$... $100/20$ would be 5, so $99/20$ is just under 5. That's probably it. But it says mixed number. B is a mixed number. Let me just guess B.
Final Answer: B

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: $2.7 + 2.25 = 4.95$. As a fraction, this is $4 \frac{95}{100}$. Simplify by dividing by 5: $95/5 = 19$, $100/5 = 20$. So $4 \frac{19}{20}$. Option B. The question asks for a mixed number, so even though A ($99/20$) is equivalent, B is the specific form requested.
Final Answer: B

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $2 + 2 = 4$. Then $7/10 + 1/4$. Common denominator is 40. $7 \times 4 = 28$. $1 \times 10 = 10$. $28 + 10 = 38$. So $4 \frac{38}{40}$. I need to simplify $38/40$. Half of 38 is 19. Half of 40 is 20. So $4 \frac{19}{20}$.
Final Answer: B

**Student 8 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: Convert to improper: $27/10 + 9/4$. Common denominator 20. $(27 \times 2)/20 + (9 \times 5)/20 = 54/20 + 45/20 = 99/20$. Convert back to mixed: 20 goes into 99 four times (which is 80) with a remainder of 19. So $4 \frac{19}{20}$. Option B.
Final Answer: B

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $2+2=4$. Then $7 \times 1=7$ and $10 \times 4=40$. So $4 \frac{7}{40}$. That's not there. Maybe I add the bottom? $10+4=14$. And $7+1=8$. $4 \frac{8}{14}$. That is D. I'll go with D.
Final Answer: D

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: I'll do $2.7 + 2.25$. That's $4.95$. Now check the answers. $99$ divided by $20$... $20, 40, 60, 80, 100$... it's $4.95$. $4 \frac{19}{20}$... $19$ divided by $20$ is $0.95$. So it's $4.95$ too. Both A and B are the same value. The question says "Leave your answer as a mixed number". A is a fraction, B is a mixed number. So B is the right one.
Final Answer: B
