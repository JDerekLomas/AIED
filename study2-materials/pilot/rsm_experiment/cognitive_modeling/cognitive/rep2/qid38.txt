### Student 1 [ability: below_basic]
"Okay, fractions. I hate these. Top plus top, bottom plus bottom. That’s how you do it, right? So $3 + 4 = 7$ for the top. Then $2x + x$... wait, is that $3x$? Yeah, $2x$ and one more $x$ is $3x$. So it's $7$ over $3x$. That looks like one of the answers."
**Final Answer Choice: B**

### Student 2 [ability: basic]
"I need a common denominator. The first one is $2x$ and the second is $x$. I can just multiply them? $2x$ times $x$ is $2x^2$. No, that’s too complicated. Oh, I can just make the second one $2x$! To get $x$ to $2x$, I multiply by 2. So I do $4 \times 2 = 8$. Now I have $3/2x + 8/2x$. $3 + 8$ is 11. The bottom stays the same... $2x$. So $11/2x$."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

### Student 3 [ability: proficient]
"Adding fractions requires a common denominator. The denominators are $2x$ and $x$. The lowest common multiple is $2x$. The first fraction already has it. For the second fraction, $4/x$, I need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 2. That gives me $8/2x$. Adding them together: $(3 + 8) / 2x = 11/2x$. Can I simplify $11/2x$ further? No, 11 is prime. A is the answer."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

### Student 4 [ability: basic]
"Denominator needs to be the same. I'll make them both $2x$. So $3/2x$ stays. Then for $4/x$, I need to add 2 to the bottom? No, that's not right, you have to multiply. $x \times 2 = 2x$. If I multiply the bottom by 2, I multiply the top by 2. $4 \times 2 = 8$. So $3 + 8 = 11$. The bottom is $2x + 2x = 4x$. Wait, is it $4x$ or $2x$? When you add fractions, the bottom stays the same. So $11/2x$."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

### Student 5 [ability: below_basic]
"3 over 2x plus 4 over x. The $x$ is at the bottom for both. 3 plus 4 is 7. And then there's a 2 there. Maybe it’s just $7/2x$? That’s choice D. It looks simpler than the other ones. I'll go with D."
**Final Answer Choice: D**

### Student 6 [ability: basic]
"I remember the butterfly method. $3 \times x = 3x$. $2x \times 4 = 8x$. $3x + 8x = 11x$. Then multiply the bottoms: $2x \times x = 2x^2$. So $11x / 2x^2$. Can I cancel anything? There’s an $x$ on top and $x^2$ on bottom. If I cross out one $x$, I get $11 / 2x$. Okay, cool, that worked."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

### Student 7 [ability: proficient]
"$\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$. To add these, I'll find a common denominator of $2x$. Multiply the second term by $2/2$ to get $\frac{8}{2x}$. Summing the numerators gives $3 + 8 = 11$. The denominator remains $2x$. Result: $\frac{11}{2x}$."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

### Student 8 [ability: advanced]
"The expression is $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$. Factoring out $1/x$, I have $\frac{1}{x} \cdot (\frac{3}{2} + 4)$. Converting 4 to a fraction with denominator 2, I get $8/2$. So $\frac{1}{x} \cdot (\frac{3+8}{2}) = \frac{1}{x} \cdot \frac{11}{2} = \frac{11}{2x}$. Simplest form, matches A."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

### Student 9 [ability: below_basic]
"There's an $x$ on both. Just ignore the $x$ for a second. $3/2 + 4$. That’s like $1.5 + 4$ which is $5.5$. $5.5$ is $11/2$. Then put the $x$ back on the bottom. $11/2x$. Wait, did I do that right? Let me check the options. $11/2x$ is there. Let me try $3+4$ again... 7. $7/x$? No. I'll stick with $11/2x$ because it was on the list."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

### Student 10 [ability: basic]
"Common denominator is $2x$. I have $3/2x$. For the other one, it's $4/x$... oh! I multiply the top by 2 but forgot the bottom. No, wait, that's the same thing. $8/2x$. $3 + 8 = 11$. Wait, what if the denominator is $x$ and I change the first one? $3/2$ is $1.5$. So $1.5/x + 4/x = 5.5/x$. Is $5.5/x$ the same as $11/2x$? Yeah, it is. Choice A."
**Final Answer Choice: A**
