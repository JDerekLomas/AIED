Okay, adding fractions. I need to add the big numbers first. 2 plus 1 is 3. Now the fractions. 1/5 plus 2/5. The bottom numbers are the same, so I just add the top ones. 1 plus 2 is 3. So it’s 3 and 3/5. Let me check the options. Yeah, A is 3 and 3/5.
Final answer choice: **A**

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
2 1/5 + 1 2/5. 2 + 1 = 3. 1/5 + 2/5... I remember my teacher saying you add everything. 1 + 2 = 3 and 5 + 5 = 10. So it's 3 and 3/10. Is that an option? Yes, D. That looks right because I added everything up.
Final answer choice: **D**

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
This is straightforward addition of mixed numbers. Since the denominators are both 5, I don't need a common denominator.
Whole numbers: 2 + 1 = 3.
Fractions: 1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5.
Combined: 3 3/5. 
The question asks for a mixed number. Option A is a mixed number, B is an improper fraction. A is the one.
Final answer choice: **A**

**Student 4 [ability: below_basic]**
I hate fractions. 2 1/5... 1 2/5... there are two 5s at the bottom. Maybe I multiply them? No, it's plus. 2 + 1 is 3. 1 + 2 is 3. 5 + 5 is 10. Okay, 3 3/10. Wait, C is 18/10. 18 divided by 10 is 1.8... no. I'll go with D because I got 3, 3, and 10.
Final answer choice: **D**

**Student 5 [ability: advanced]**
I’ll quickly convert to improper fractions to be safe, even though adding the parts is faster.
2 1/5 = 11/5.
1 2/5 = 7/5.
11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5.
The question asks for a mixed number. 18 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 3. So, 3 3/5.
Option A.
Final answer choice: **A**

**Student 6 [ability: below_basic]**
Uh... 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 5. Maybe I just add all the top numbers? 2+1+1+2 = 6. And the bottom is 5? 6/5? That’s not there. Okay, 2 + 1 is 3. Then there is a 1/5 and 2/5. If I ignore the 5s and just add 1 and 2, it's 3. So 3 and 3. Is it 18? B and C have 18. How do you get 18? 5 times 3 is 15... plus 3 is 18. So 18/5? But it says mixed number. A looks like a mixed number. I'll pick A.
Final answer choice: **A**

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
(2 + 1/5) + (1 + 2/5)
= 2 + 1 + 1/5 + 2/5
= 3 + 3/5
= 3 3/5.
Checking the list:
A is 3 3/5.
B is 18/5 (which is the same value, but not a mixed number).
C is 18/10 (wrong).
D is 3 3/10 (added denominators incorrectly).
It's A.
Final answer choice: **A**

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
I remember improper fractions are better.
2 times 5 is 10, plus 1 is 11. So 11/5.
1 times 5 is 5, plus 2 is 7. So 7/5.
11 + 7 = 18.
The bottom stays the same, so 18/5.
Let me look at the answers... B is 18/5. Done. (Wait, the question says mixed number... I didn't see that). Actually, B is there, so I'll just pick it. 
Final answer choice: **B**

**Student 9 [ability: basic]**
2 1/5 plus 1 2/5.
Whole numbers make 3.
Fractions make 3/5.
Answer is 3 3/5. 
Looking at the choices... A is 3 3/5. Easy.
Final answer choice: **A**

**Student 10 [ability: below_basic]**
I don't know how to do mixed numbers. Maybe I just add the big numbers 2+1=3. Then the 1/5 and 2/5. 1+2 is 3 and 5+5 is 10. So 3 3/10. Choice D is that exactly.
Final answer choice: **D**
