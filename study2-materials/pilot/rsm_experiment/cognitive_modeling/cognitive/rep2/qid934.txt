### Student 1 [ability: advanced]
"Okay, the question asks for the value of $y$ when $x = 0$. I need to substitute $x=0$ into the equation $4x + 2y = 10$. If $x$ is $0$, then $4(0)$ is $0$. That leaves me with $0 + 2y = 10$, which simplifies to $2y = 10$. To solve for $y$, I divide both sides by $2$. $10$ divided by $2$ is $5$. Let me double check... $4(0) + 2(5) = 10$, yes, $10=10$. The answer is 5."
**Final Answer Choice: C**

### Student 2 [ability: below_basic]
"I hate algebra. The table has $0, 1, 2, 3, 4$ and then a star. The numbers $4$ and $2$ and $10$ are in the equation. Maybe I just add them? $4 + 2 + 10 = 16$. That's not an option. Maybe I do $10$ minus $4$ minus $2$? $10 - 4 = 6$, $6 - 2 = 4$. Still not there. Wait, the first number in the $x$ row is $0$. $10$ divided by $4$ is $2.5$. That's choice D. I'll just pick D because it looks like a mathy decimal."
**Final Answer Choice: D**

### Student 3 [ability: basic]
"The star is under the $0$. So $x$ is $0$. The equation is $4x + 2y = 10$. If I put $0$ where the $x$ is, it becomes $40$. No, that’s not right, it's $4$ times $0$. $4$ times $0$ is $0$. So now I have $2y = 10$. What times $2$ makes $10$? $2, 4, 6, 8, 10...$ that's $5$. So $y$ is $5$."
**Final Answer Choice: C**

### Student 4 [ability: proficient]
"Substitute $x=0$ into $4x + 2y = 10$. 
$4(0) + 2y = 10$
$0 + 2y = 10$
$y = 10 / 2$
$y = 5$. 
The star represents $y$ when $x=0$. Choice C."
**Final Answer Choice: C**

### Student 5 [ability: basic]
"I remember something about the number at the start of the table being the constant. But there are two numbers next to $x$ and $y$. Let's try plugging in the numbers. If $x$ is $0$, the $4x$ part just disappears. Then I have $2y = 10$. I'll subtract $2$ from $10$ because it's positive? $10 - 2 = 8$. Not an option. Oh, wait, it’s $2$ times $y$, so I divide. $10 \div 2 = 5$."
**Final Answer Choice: C**

### Student 6 [ability: basic]
"The equation is $4x + 2y = 10$. I'm looking for the $y$ value when $x$ is $0$.
$4 \times 0 + 2y = 10$.
$0 + 2y = 10$.
$2y = 10$.
Wait, I remember a teacher saying you subtract the $x$ bit. $10 - 0 = 10$.
Then divide by $2$. $10 / 2 = 5$.
Wait, did I do that right? What if it's the other way? If $y$ was $0$, $x$ would be $2.5$. The question asks for the star under $x=0$, so $y$ must be $5$."
**Final Answer Choice: C**

### Student 7 [ability: below_basic]
"Table of values... okay. The $y$ row is usually like $2, 4, 6, 8...$ or something. If $x$ is $0$, and there's a $10$ at the end of the equation, maybe it's $2 \times 10$? $20$ is an option. Yeah, $4 \times 0$ is $0$, and then maybe you just do $2$ times $10$ because $y$ is next to the $2$. I'll go with A."
**Final Answer Choice: A**

### Student 8 [ability: proficient]
"This is a linear equation in standard form. To find the $y$-intercept (where $x=0$), I cover up the $4x$ term because $4(0)=0$.
That leaves $2y = 10$.
Divide by $2$: $y = 5$. 
Checking the options... C is $5$. Easy."
**Final Answer Choice: C**

### Student 9 [ability: below_basic]
"I don't know how to do the equation with two letters. But the $x$ goes $0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. Maybe the $y$ goes $5, 4, 3, 2, 1$? If I put $3$ for the star... $4(0) + 2(3) = 6$. That's not $10$. What if I put $5$ for the star? $4(0) + 2(5) = 10$. Oh! That works! I just guessed and checked the first one."
**Final Answer Choice: C**

### Student 10 [ability: basic]
"Okay, $x=0$. The equation is $4x+2y=10$.
$4 + 0 + 2y = 10$? No, it's $4$ times $x$. 
So $0 + 2y = 10$.
If $2y = 10$, then $y$ must be $5$.
Wait, let me look at the table again. Usually these go down by a certain amount.
If $x=1$, $4(1)+2y=10 \Rightarrow 2y=6 \Rightarrow y=3$.
So if $x=0, y=5$ and if $x=1, y=3$. The pattern is going down by $2$. 
So the first one is definitely $5$."
