**Student 1 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: Okay, brackets. I need to times the numbers. $m$ and $m$ is $2m$. Then $-5$ and $-7$. A minus and a minus make a plus. $5 \times 7$ is $35$. So it's $2m + 35$. Wait, that’s not an option. Let me look at the choices. They all have $m^2$. Okay, so $m \times m$ is $m^2$. Then just do $-5$ take away $7$ for the middle bit? No, that’s $-12$. But the last number is $-5 \times -7$, which is $+35$. Let me look at C and B. I’ll guess C because there are lots of pluses.
Answer: C

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: FOIL method. 
Firsts: $m \times m = m^2$. 
Outers: $m \times -7 = -7m$. 
Inners: $-5 \times m = -5m$. 
Lasts: $-5 \times -7$. 
Wait, $5 \times 7$ is $35$. A negative times a negative is a negative... no, it's a positive. So $+35$. 
Now combine the middle: $-7m - 5m$. If I owe 7 and owe 5, I owe 12. So $-12m$. 
So $m^2 - 12m + 35$.
Answer: B

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: Expanding $(m-5)(m-7)$. 
I'll use the grid method mentally. 
$m \times m = m^2$. 
The constants are $-5$ and $-7$. 
Sum: $-5 + (-7) = -12$. 
Product: $-5 \times -7 = 35$. 
So it’s $m^2 - 12m + 35$. 
Checking signs: negative times negative is positive, so the end must be $+35$. Negative plus negative is further negative, so $-12m$ is correct. 
Answer: B

**Student 4 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $m$ times $m$ is $m^2$. 
Then $5$ times $7$ is $35$. 
There is a minus sign there. 
$m^2 - 35$. 
That’s not there. Maybe I subtract the numbers? $7 - 5 = 2$. 
So $m^2 - 2m - 35$. That’s option A.
Answer: A

**Student 5 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Multiply everything in the first bracket by the second.
$m(m-7) - 5(m-7)$
$m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35$
Okay, $m^2$ is the start. 
$-7m - 5m$ is... $-2m$? No, wait. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. It’s $12m$. 
Is it positive or negative? $-7 - 5$ goes further down the number line, so $-12m$.
The last bit is $-5 \times -7$. I always forget if two minuses make a plus. I think they do. $+35$.
Answer: B

**Student 6 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: This is a standard quadratic expansion of the form $(x+a)(x+b) = x^2 + (a+b)x + ab$.
Here, $a = -5$ and $b = -7$.
Linear coefficient: $-5 + (-7) = -12$.
Constant term: $(-5)(-7) = 35$.
Result: $m^2 - 12m + 35$.
Choice B matches.
Answer: B

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $(m-5)(m-7)$
$m \times m = m^2$
$m \times -7 = -7m$
$-5 \times m = -5m$
$-5 \times -7 = -35$ (Wait, $5 \times 7$ is 35, and there's a minus).
Combine: $m^2 - 12m - 35$.
Looking at the options... that is D.
Answer: D

**Student 8 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $m-5$ and $m-7$. 
$m$ and $m$ is $m^2$. 
$5 + 7 = 12$. 
Since everything is minus, the answer should have pluses? Like when you do two negatives it turns into a plus. 
So $m^2 + 12m + 35$. 
Answer: C

**Student 9 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: Expanding $(m-5)(m-7)$. 
$m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35$. 
The middle terms are $-7m$ and $-5m$. 
$-7 - 5 = -12$. 
The constant is $-5 \times -7 = 35$. 
$m^2 - 12m + 35$. 
Wait, let me double check the signs. Both are negative in the brackets, so the middle term must be negative and the last term must be positive. B is the only one that fits that.
Answer: B

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $(m-5)(m-7)$
$m \times m = m^2$
$5 \times 7 = 35$
The middle is $7-5 = 2m$. 
Wait, it's $-7$ and $-5$. 
$-7m - 5m = -12m$. 
Now I just need the last bit. Is it $+35$ or $-35$?
$-5$ times $-7$. 
Two minuses make a plus. So $+35$.
