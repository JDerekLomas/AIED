### Student 1 [ability: advanced]
**Thinking:** I need to evaluate both sides of the box using BODMAS/BIDMAS. 
Left side: $8 + 12 \div 4$. Division comes before addition. $12 \div 4 = 3$. Then $8 + 3 = 11$. 
Right side: $(8 + 12) \div 4$. Brackets first. $8 + 12 = 20$. Then $20 \div 4 = 5$. 
Comparing the results: $11$ and $5$. Since $11 > 5$, the symbol is $>$.
**Answer: A**

### Student 2 [ability: below_basic]
**Thinking:** Okay, the numbers are the same on both sides. $8, 12, 4$ and $8, 12, 4$. Usually, if the numbers are the same, they equal each other. The brackets just show where the numbers are, right? I'll go with equal because it looks balanced.
**Answer: C**

### Student 3 [ability: basic]
**Thinking:** Let's work it out. 
Left: $8 + 12 = 20$. Then $20 \div 4 = 5$. 
Right: $(8 + 12)$ is $20$. $20 \div 4 = 5$. 
Wait, $5$ and $5$? They are the same. Oh, I remember something about order of operations but I always just go left to right. It feels right that they are the same.
**Answer: C**

### Student 4 [ability: proficient]
**Thinking:** Order of operations is key here. 
Left side: $8 + 12 \div 4$. I must divide first. $12 \div 4 = 3$. $8 + 3 = 11$. 
Right side: $(8 + 12) \div 4$. The parentheses force the addition first. $8 + 12 = 20$. $20 \div 4 = 5$. 
$11$ is definitely greater than $5$. So it's A.
**Answer: A**

### Student 5 [ability: basic]
**Thinking:** $8$ plus $12$ divided by $4$... that’s $20$ divided by $4$ which is $5$. 
On the other side, brackets mean do it first. $8+12$ is $20$. $20$ divided by $4$ is $5$. 
Wait, is there a trick? I think $5 = 5$. I’ll pick C.
**Answer: C**

### Student 6 [ability: proficient]
**Thinking:** I have to be careful with the left side. It's $8 + (12/4)$. 
$12 / 4 = 3$. 
$8 + 3 = 11$. 
Right side: $(8 + 12) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5$. 
$11$ vs $5$. 
$11$ is larger. 
Choice A.
**Answer: A**

### Student 7 [ability: below_basic]
**Thinking:** I hate fractions and division. $8+12$ is $20$. $20$ divide $4$ is $5$. 
The other side has brackets. Does that mean multiply? No, it’s just $8+12$ which is $20$. $20$ divide $4$. 
Everything is $5$. They are the same. I'll pick C. Or maybe D? No, C looks safer.
**Answer: C**

### Student 8 [ability: advanced]
**Thinking:** Left side: $8 + 12 \div 4 = 8 + 3 = 11$. 
Right side: $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$. 
The expression on the left doesn't have parentheses, so the division happens first. The expression on the right forces the addition first, which results in a smaller numerator effectively. $11 > 5$.
**Answer: A**

### Student 9 [ability: basic]
**Thinking:** Left: $8 + 12 \div 4$. If I do division first, it's $8+3=11$. If I do it left to right, it's $20/4=5$. 
BIDMAS says division first... so $11$. 
Right: $(8+12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$. 
Okay, so $11$ and $5$. $11$ is more than $5$. That's the symbol $>$.
**Answer: A**

### Student 10 [ability: below_basic]
**Thinking:** I don't know. $8+12+4 = 24$. $8+12+4 = 24$. They look like the same numbers so they are probably equal. My teacher says brackets are important but I don't remember why. I'll just guess =.
**Answer: C**
