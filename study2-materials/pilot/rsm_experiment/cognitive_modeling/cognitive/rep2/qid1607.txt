**Student 1 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: Okay, look at the equation. $15$ equals $1$ plus $k$ over $4$. In Step 1, the $15$ turned into $60$. How did that happen? Maybe they added $45$? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, $15 \times 4$ is $60$. So they moved the $4$. That seems like a big jump. Then in Step 2, $60$ becomes $61$ because of the $1$. $60 + 1 = 61$. That looks right to me. Both steps followed a pattern.
Final Answer: C

**Student 2 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: To solve $15 = (1+k)/4$, I need to get $k$ by itself. First, get rid of the division by $4$ by multiplying by $4$. $15 \times 4 = 60$. So Step 1 is $60 = 1+k$. That is correct. Now Step 2. If $60 = 1+k$, I need to subtract $1$ from both sides to get $k$. So $60 - 1 = 59$. But the student wrote $61$. They must have added $1$ instead of subtracting it. So Step 1 is right, but Step 2 is wrong.
Final Answer: A

**Student 3 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: The equation is $15 = \frac{1+k}{4}$. Step 1: Multiply both sides by $4$. $15 \times 4 = 60$, and $\frac{1+k}{4} \times 4 = 1+k$. So $60 = 1+k$ is correct. Step 2: To isolate $k$, subtract $1$ from both sides. $60 - 1 = 59$. Isaac wrote $61$, which means he added $1$ to the left side instead of subtracting. Step 1 is correct, Step 2 is incorrect.
Final Answer: A

**Student 4 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: Let's check Isaac's work. Step 1: he multiplied the $15$ by $4$ to get $60$. That’s the right way to start an equation with a denominator. Step 2: he has $60 = 1+k$. To find $k$, you do the inverse of $+1$, which is $-1$. $60 - 1$ is $59$. He got $61$, so he messed up the sign. Only the first bit is right.
Final Answer: A

**Student 5 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: I hate fractions. $15 = (1+k) / 4$. To get rid of the fraction, you multiply. $15 \times 4$... $15, 30, 45, 60$. Okay, so $60 = 1+k$. That's what Isaac has for Step 1. For Step 2, he has $k = 61$. If $k$ is $61$, then $1+61$ is $62$. $62$ divided by $4$ is... not $15$. But if $k$ was $59$, then $1+59$ is $60$, and $60/4$ is $15$. So $61$ is definitely wrong. Step 1 worked, Step 2 failed.
Final Answer: A

**Student 6 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $15 = 1+k/4$. In Step 1 he got $60$. I think he did $15 \times 4$. But then he has $1+k$. Where did the $4$ go? I don't get it. Step 2 says $61=k$. $60+1$ is $61$. That makes sense. I'll just guess they are both right because the numbers match up. 
Final Answer: C

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: Let's solve it myself first. $15 = (1+k)/4 \rightarrow 60 = 1+k \rightarrow k = 59$. Comparing to Isaac: Isaac's Step 1 is $60 = 1+k$, which matches mine. Isaac's Step 2 is $k=61$, which is wrong because he added $1$ to $60$ instead of subtracting. Only Step 1 is correct.
Final Answer: A

**Student 8 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $15 = 1+k$ over $4$. This looks hard. $60$ and $61$... maybe he just added the numbers? $15+4$ is $19$... no. $60+1$ is $61$. That works for Step 2. Is Step 1 right? I'll just pick C because it looks like he did the work.
Final Answer: C

**Student 9 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: Analyzing Step 1: Multiplication property of equality applied correctly ($15 \times 4 = 60$). Step 1 is correct. Analyzing Step 2: Addition property of equality applied incorrectly. He should have added $-1$ to both sides, resulting in $k = 59$. Instead, he likely saw $+1$ and instinctively added it to the $60$. Only Step 1 holds up.
Final Answer: A

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $15 = (1+k)/4$. Step 1: $15 \times 4 = 60$, so $60 = 1+k$. Correct. Step 2: $61=k$. Wait, if $k$ is $61$, then $61+1$ is $62$. $62$ divided by $4$ is $15.5$. That’s almost $15$ but not quite. Isaac must have made a mistake on the second step. He probably should have subtracted. So only the first step is correct.
