**Student 1 [ability: advanced]**
Reasoning: Okay, volume of a sphere formula is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. I need to rearrange this to solve for $r$. First, I’ll multiply both sides by 3 to get $3V = 4\pi r^3$. Then, I’ll divide by $4\pi$ to isolate the $r^3$. That gives me $r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$. To get $r$, I just take the cube root of the whole thing. So $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$. Looking at the options... that matches C.
Answer: C

**Student 2 [ability: below_basic]**
Reasoning: Sphere volume. I remember there’s a 4 and a 3 and a $\pi$. The question has $V$ in it. All the answers have $V$. Option D looks different because the $V$ isn't under the big square root thing as much. Wait, it's a cube root. Radius is usually $V$ divided by something? Let's guess A because the formula starts with $4/3$. 
Answer: A

**Student 3 [ability: proficient]**
Reasoning: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. I need to get $r$ on its own.
$V = (4/3) \times \pi \times r^3$.
Divide by $\pi \rightarrow V/\pi = \frac{4}{3}r^3$.
Multiply by 3 $\rightarrow 3V/\pi = 4r^3$.
Divide by 4 $\rightarrow \frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$.
Cube root both sides $\rightarrow \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$. That's option C.
Answer: C

**Student 4 [ability: basic]**
Reasoning: I know the formula is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. I need to move the $\frac{4}{3}$ to the other side. When you move a fraction, you flip it, right? So it becomes $\frac{3}{4} V$. And the $\pi$ is on the top, so it goes to the bottom. So $\frac{3V}{4\pi}$. Then there is a 3 for the radius because it was $r$ cubed. So I need a cube root. Option B has $4V$ on top, but I think the 3 should be on top. Option C has $3V$ on top.
Answer: C

**Student 5 [ability: basic]**
Reasoning: Sphere formula... $4 \pi r^2$ is area, so $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ is volume.
$V = \frac{4\pi r^3}{3}$.
To get $r$, I do $V$ times $4\pi$ then divide by 3? No, that's not right.
If $V = \frac{4}{3} \times \dots$, then to undo it I should multiply by $\frac{4}{3}$. 
$V \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{4V}{3}$. 
Then divide by $\pi$.
$\frac{4V}{3\pi}$.
Then the cube root thingy. That looks like option B.
Answer: B

**Student 6 [ability: below_basic]**
Reasoning: I hate algebra. There is a 3 and a 4 and a circle symbol. Radius is halfway across the sphere. If the volume is $V$, the radius is smaller than $V$. All these options have a cube root $\sqrt[3]{}$. Maybe it's D because it looks the most complicated? No, let's go with B because I saw $4/3$ in the textbook once.
Answer: B

**Student 7 [ability: basic]**
Reasoning: Formula: $V = 4/3 \pi r^3$. 
I'll move the 3 first. $3V = 4\pi r^3$.
Then move the $4$. $3V/4 = \pi r^3$.
Then the $\pi$. $3V/4\pi = r^3$. 
Wait, is the $\pi$ on the top or bottom? $4 \times \pi$, so it goes to the bottom.
So $\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$.
Then cube root it. 
Looking at the options... B is $4V/3\pi$ and C is $3V/4\pi$. 
Okay, it's definitely C. 
Answer: C

**Student 8 [ability: proficient]**
Reasoning: Start with $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.
To isolate $r^3$:
$r^3 = \frac{V}{\frac{4}{3}\pi} = \frac{V}{\frac{4\pi}{3}}$.
Multiplying by the reciprocal: $r^3 = V \cdot \frac{3}{4\pi} = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$.
Taking the cube root: $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$.
Easy. That is C.
Answer: C

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
Reasoning: Volume of a sphere... is it $\pi r^2$? No, that's a circle. Is it $2\pi r$? No.
The question shows a sphere. The formula must be in the question? No.
I'll just look at the options. They all have $V, \pi, 3, 4$. 
A has $4\pi$ on top. Let's guess A. 
Answer: A

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
Reasoning: $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$.
I need $r$.
$V$ divided by $4/3$ is $r^3$?
$V \div 1.33 = r^3 \dots$ no.
Let's try moving terms.
$V = 4/3 \pi r^3$.
$\frac{V}{\pi} = 4/3 r^3$.
$3 \times \frac{V}{\pi} = 4 r^3$.
$\frac{3V}{\pi \times 4} = r^3$.
$\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}} = r$.
Checks options. Option C matches perfectly.
