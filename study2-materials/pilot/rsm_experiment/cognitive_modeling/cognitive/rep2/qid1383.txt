**Student 1 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: Okay, the letters are $T$ and $k$. It says $T = k^4$ and $k$ is $-3$. So I just put $-3$ in there. $T = -3 \times 4$. Three times four is twelve, and there's a minus sign, so it's minus twelve. That's one of the answers.
Final Answer: D

**Student 2 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: $T = k^4$, substitute $k = -3$. So $T = (-3)^4$. This means $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$. I know $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$ is $81$. Since the power is even (4), the negative signs cancel out in pairs. $(-3) \times (-3) = 9$. Then $9 \times 9 = 81$. It’s definitely positive 81. 
Final Answer: A

**Student 3 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $k$ is $-3$ and the power is $4$. So it's $-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$. $3 \times 3$ is $9$. $9 \times 3$ is $27$. $27 \times 3$ is... let me check... $20 \times 3 = 60$, $7 \times 3 = 21$, so $81$. Now the sign. There's a minus in the question. Does the minus stay? Usually, if it starts negative, it stays negative? I think it’s $-81$ because the $k$ is negative.
Final Answer: C

**Student 4 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $T = k$ to the 4. If $k$ is $-3$, I'll just do $3 \times 4$. That is $12$. There's no negative $12$ as a main choice... oh wait, D is $-12$. Let's go with $12$ because $T$ usually isn't negative in these problems? No, B is $12$. I'll pick B.
Final Answer: B

**Student 5 [ability: advanced]**
Thinking: Evaluating $T = k^n$ for $k = -3, n = 4$. $T = (-3)^4$. Since $n$ is even, the result must be positive because $(-1)^{2n} = 1$. $3^4 = 81$. Simple.
Final Answer: A

**Student 6 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: $k^4$ means $k$ times itself four times. $-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$. Two negatives make a plus, so $9 \times 9 = 81$. Wait, did I miss something? Sometimes the calculator says $-81$ if you don't use brackets. But the question says $k$ is $-3$, so the whole of $k$ is being powered. That should be positive 81.
Final Answer: A

**Student 7 [ability: proficient]**
Thinking: $T = (-3)^4$. $3^4 = 81$. Because the exponent is $4$, which is even, the negative signs will pair up and become positive. $-3 \times -3 = 9$. $9 \times -3 = -27$. $-27 \times -3 = 81$.
Final Answer: A

**Student 8 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: I remember my teacher saying that if you have a negative number to a power, you have to be careful. $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$ is $81$. Is it positive or negative? I think $k^4$ is $-3^4$. My calculator at home once told me $-3^4$ is $-81$. I’ll go with that.
Final Answer: C

**Student 9 [ability: below_basic]**
Thinking: $T=k^4$. $k$ is $-3$. So $-3, -3, -3, -3$. Add them? No, times them. $3 \times 3 = 6$... no $3 \times 3 = 9$. $9+9=18$? No, it's $3 \times 4 = 12$. I see $12$ and $-12$. It has a minus so $-12$.
Final Answer: D

**Student 10 [ability: basic]**
Thinking: Substituting $-3$ into $k^4$. $-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$. First two make $9$. Next two make $9$. $9 \times 9 = 81$. Okay, it’s 81. Let me double-check... $(-3) \times (-3) = 9$; $9 \times (-3) = -27$; $(-27) \times (-3) = 81$. Yes, 81. 
Final Answer: A
