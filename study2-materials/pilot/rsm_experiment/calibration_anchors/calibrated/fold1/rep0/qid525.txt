Based on the response patterns of this cohort—who consistently struggle with order of operations (BIDMAS), algebraic manipulation, and foundational arithmetic principles—here is the prediction. 

This specific student group shows a strong tendency toward "intuitive but incorrect" methods, such as adding numerators and denominators directly or misinterpreting order of operations.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
*   **D (4 8/14):** This is the most "attractive" error for this cohort. It involves adding the whole numbers (2+2=4) and then simply adding the numerators (7+1=8) and the denominators (10+4=14). Given that 77% chose a similar path in the linear equation table (adding/halving without balancing) and 62% ignored the zero in the mean calculation, this "add across" strategy will be highly prevalent.
*   **A (99/20):** This is the correct numerical value but expressed as an improper fraction. The question specifically asks for a mixed number. Based on the 0% success rate on several multi-step or specifically-formatted questions above, even students who can calculate the value are likely to ignore the formatting instruction.
*   **C (99/40):** A common multiplication error (multiplying denominators while adding numerators, or converting to improper fractions and then multiplying denominators instead of finding a common one).

**Predicted Distribution:**
