Based on the performance data from the previous questions, this cohort exhibits significant difficulties with BIDMAS (order of operations) and the structural "appearance" of algebraic expressions. 

Looking at the calibration data, we see:
1.  **Strong Misconception of Addition/Subtraction Order**: 76% incorrectly performed addition before subtraction (Problem P).
2.  **Fraction/Division Confusion**: 77% picked the wrong denominator/structure in the linear equation table, and 69% incorrectly combined numerators in the algebraic fraction question.
3.  **Operation Reversal**: In the equation $10=5/p$, most students (59%) chose "no solution" or multiplied incorrectly, showing a lack of understanding of division placement.

For the question $c \div(h+4)$:
- **Option B** is an "attractive nuisance" for students who feel the need to distribute or balance the terms unnecessarily.
- **Option C** mirrors the BIDMAS error seen in the "Mean" question (where students ignored the grouping required for a numerator), assuming the division only applies to the first term.
- **Option D** is a classic "fraction flip" error, very common in students who struggle with the order of dividend and divisor.
