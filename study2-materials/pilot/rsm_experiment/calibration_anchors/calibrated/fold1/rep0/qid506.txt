To predict the performance for the question $3p = \frac{1}{12}$, we must look at the specific misconceptions evidenced in the calibration data. 

In the calibration questions, these students struggled significantly with fractions and inverse operations. Specifically:
1. **Misapplied operations with 3:** In the equation $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$, 88% thought $x-5=36$ and $\frac{x}{3}=17$ were both incorrect, showing a fundamental confusion about "moving" a 3. 
2. **"Easy" integer division over fraction logic:** In $10 = \frac{5}{p}$, many students chose D or B (50), struggling with reciprocal logic.
3. **Multiplication instead of division:** The most common "attractive" error when seeing a 3 and a 12 is to assume the answer is 4 (either $\frac{1}{4}$ or $4$) because $12 \div 3 = 4$.

For $3p = \frac{1}{12}$, the correct step is to divide by 3 (or multiply by $\frac{1}{3}$), giving $p = \frac{1}{36}$. However, the vast majority of these Year 9s will see "3" and "12" and perform a standard division, resulting in $\frac{1}{4}$ or 4. Based on the $10 = \frac{5}{p}$ result, Option A is the strongest "distractor."
