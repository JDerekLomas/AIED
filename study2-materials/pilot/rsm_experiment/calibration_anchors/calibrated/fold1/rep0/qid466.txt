To predict the performance of this Year 9 cohort, we must look at the trends in the calibration data. This specific group exhibits several defining characteristics:
1.  **Massive Negative Sign Neglect:** In the bracket expansion question, 99% of students thought $-1 \times -4$ resulted in a negative number (Option D). In the $k^4$ question, 53% thought $(-3)^4$ was negative.
2.  **Order of Operations and Reciprocal Failure:** There is a fundamental struggle with fractions and rearranging equations ($10 = 5/p$ and the sphere formula).
3.  **Additive "Matching" Bias:** Many students gravitate towards the option that looks most like the numbers already in the question or mirrors the existing sign without operational logic (e.g., 84% choosing $ \geq $ for a comparison simply because the numbers looked similar).

**The Calculation Errors:**
*   **Option B ($-4/3$):** This is the "Additive Inverse" trap. Students see $-3/4$ and think "to get to 1, I need another minus sign to make it positive," but they likely fixate on the negative sign already being present in the question and assume the answer must also be negative.
*   **Option C ($3/4$):** "Magic Cancellation." Students assume the star is just the same number but positive to "neutralise" the sign, failing to address the product resulting in 1.
*   **Option A ($4/3$):** The correct answer.

Given that 99% of these students failed to identify that a negative times a negative equals a positive in the bracket question, and 59% believed $10=5/p$ had "no solutions" or was $p=50$, they will struggle immensely with the concept of a reciprocal.

The most "attractive" wrong answer for this specific cohort will be D or B, driven by a complete misunderstanding of how negative signs interact under multiplication.
