Based on the response patterns of this specific cohort, here is the predicted distribution for the question \( 2 \frac{1}{5}+1 \frac{2}{5} \).

The cohort consistently demonstrates a tendency to combine numeric operations incorrectly, such as adding denominators or misunderstanding equivalent forms (e.g., adding the 5s in the denominators to get 10, or ignoring the request for a mixed number). 

- **Option A (Correct):** Students in the lower bands are likely to fall into the trap of adding the denominators.
- **Option B (Incorrect format):** Converting to an improper fraction but failing the "mixed number" instruction.
- **Option C (Addition error):** Adding the numerators and the denominators (fraction addition misconception).
- **Option D (Common denominator error):** Adding the whole numbers and the numerators correctly, but incorrectly adding the denominators.
