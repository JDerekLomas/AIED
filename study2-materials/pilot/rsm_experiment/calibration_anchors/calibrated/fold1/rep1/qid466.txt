To predict these responses, I am looking at the extremely high "misconception" rates in the calibration data. This specific Year 9 cohort struggles significantly with:
1.  **Directed numbers/Negative signs:** (e.g., $99\%$ chose $-5$ instead of $+4$ in expansion; $53\%$ chose $-81$ for $(-3)^4$).
2.  **Fractional Operations and Inverses:** (e.g., $88\%$ failed to recognize $17$ as the first step of solving $\frac{x}{3}-5=12$).
3.  **Reciprocals vs. Signs:** Students frequently "over-apply" or "under-apply" negative signs.

In the question $-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$:
*   **Option B ($-4/3$)** is the most "attractive" trap for lower/middle ability levels. Students see the negative result and think the multiplier *must* also be negative to "stay consistent," or they simply replicate the sign of the product.
*   **Option C/D** attract those who do not understand reciprocals and think the number needs to stay the same to reach $1$.
*   **Option A ($4/3$)** is the correct answer, requiring the understanding that $(-)\times(+) = (-)$. Given the calibration data (where only $5-8\%$ usually get logic-based sign questions right), this will be low.

Here are the predicted distributions:

below_basic: A=5% B=45% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=8% B=62% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=14% B=70% C=10% D=6%
advanced: A=35% B=55% C=5% D=5%
