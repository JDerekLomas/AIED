To predict the performance for the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\), we must consider the patterns observed in the calibration data. This specific cohort struggle significantly with multi-step operations and reciprocal logic.

**Analysis of Errors:**
- **Option A (\(p = \frac{1}{4}\)):** This is the most "attractive" distractor. Students see the numbers 3 and 12 and perform \(12 \div 3\), keeping the fraction structure without considering the algebraic move required to isolate \(p\).
- **Option B (Correct: \(p = \frac{1}{36}\)):** Requires multiplying both sides by \(\frac{1}{3}\) or dividing the numerator/multiplying the denominator. Given that only 17% solved \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\) and 8% understood basic equation steps, this will be very low.
- **Option C (\(p = 4\)):** A total inversion of the problem, performing \(12 \div 3\) and ignoring the fraction entirely.
- **Option D (\(p = \frac{1}{9}\)):** A potential confusion where a student might mistakenly square or use a wrong operator, though less intuitive than A or C.

**Performance Calibration:**
The calibration questions show a cohort that heavily favors intuitive but incorrect arithmetic links (e.g., 99% chose \(-5\) for a product of negatives because they saw numbers to add, or 69% added only the numerators in algebraic fractions). For this specific question, the majority will likely opt for \(12 \div 3\) (Option A).
