To predict the performance of this Year 9 cohort, we must look at the trends in the calibration data. This group shows a massive "misconception trap" profile. Specifically:
1.  **Operation confusion:** They consistently apply rules incorrectly (e.g., adding 5+6 before subtracting from 4 in the order of operations, or choosing 7/2x for fractions).
2.  **Denominator/Calculation Blindness:** 77% of these students thought $4(0) + 2y = 10$ meant $y=2.5$, likely doing $10 \div 4$. 69% added $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$ to get $\frac{7}{2x}$ (adding the numerators but ignoring the common denominator process).
3.  **Additive misconceptions:** There is a high likelihood they will add denominators in this fraction question, similar to how they struggled with other basic algebraic and arithmetic conventions.

**Option Analysis:**
- **A (3 3/5):** The correct answer.
- **B (18/5):** Technically the correct value but improper. However, since the prompt says "Leave your answer as a mixed number," students who successfully converted but ignored the prompt might pick this—though based on the "Molly" question (99% wrong), these students struggle with precision.
- **C (18/10):** Adding both numerators and denominators. This is a very common "low-ability" error.
- **D (3 3/10):** Adding the whole numbers (3), adding the numerators (3), and adding the denominators (10). Given the calibration data showing 69% chose $\frac{7}{2x}$ for $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, adding denominators is the primary distractor.

Predicted response distribution:
