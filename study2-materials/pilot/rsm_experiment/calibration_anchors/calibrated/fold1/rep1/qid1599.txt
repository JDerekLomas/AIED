Based on the response patterns seen in the previous questions, several trends emerge for this Year 9 cohort:
1. **Misapplication of Order of Operations:** Students struggle with terms versus groups (seen in the $4+5 \times 6$ and $8+12 \div 4$ questions).
2. **Surface-Level Pattern Matching:** They often pick answers based on visual components rather than algebraic structure (seen in the Mean calculation where 62% ignored the zero, and the Equation Solving where 88% thought Katie’s "multiply by 3" logic was valid for both sides).
3. **Inversion Errors:** In fractional contexts, they frequently flip the relationship between numerator and denominator (seen in the Sphere formula and $10 = 5/p$).

For $c \div (h+4)$:
- **Option A (Correct):** Often overlooked because students expect "maths to happen" rather than just a re-writing of the expression.
- **Option C (High Attractor):** Matches the left-to-right processing of BODMAS/order of operations mistakes seen in the previous questions. Many will read $c \div h$ first and then just see $+4$.
- **Option D (High Attractor):** Consistent with the $10 = 5/p \rightarrow 50$ or the sphere volume errors where they confuse which value goes "on top".
