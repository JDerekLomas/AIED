Based on the performance data from this cohort, it is clear that these students struggle significantly with order of operations (BIDMAS), negative numbers, and standard algebraic manipulations. They consistently gravitate towards "intuitive" but incorrect shortcuts.

For the fractions question:
- **Option D (4 8/14)** is the most "attractive" trap, where students simply add the numerators and add the denominators ($7+1$ and $10+4$). Given the $77-99\%$ error rates on similar intuitive traps in the calibration set, this will be the dominant choice.
- **Option B (4 19/20)** is the correct answer. Only the highest-achieving students are likely to find a common denominator correctly.
- **Option A (99/20)** is mathematically equivalent to the correct answer but is an improper fraction, not a mixed number as requested. This will catch some "proficient" students.
- **Option C (99/40)** represents a common error when converting to improper fractions and adding with a doubled denominator.
