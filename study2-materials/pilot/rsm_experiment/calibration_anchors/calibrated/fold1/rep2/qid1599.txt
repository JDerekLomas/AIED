Based on the response patterns of this specific cohort, there is a recurring tendency to ignore brackets or misinterpret the hierarchical order of operations when expressed in standard linear notation. 

Looking at previous results, these students frequently struggled with fractional layouts (the $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$ question and the sphere formula rearrangement) and often inverted relationships or simplified "incorrectly but logically" (as seen in the Molly/expanding brackets question where 99% chose a -5 because they likely performed $-1 + -4$ instead of $-1 \times -4$).

For this question:
- **Option C** is highly "attractive" because it represents a "reading left-to-right" error ($c \div h + 4$), similar to the order of operations errors seen in the $0, 1, 3, 4, 7$ mean calculation.
- **Option D** is a classic inversion error, which was prevalent in the $10 = 5/p$ and sphere radius questions.
- **Option B** is a distractor for those trying to "fill in" missing parts of the fraction.

The correct answer (A) will likely be chosen only by students who can firmly translate bracketed division into fraction notation, a skill this data set suggests is significantly below average for this group.
