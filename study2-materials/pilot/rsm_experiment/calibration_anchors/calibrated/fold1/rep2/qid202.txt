To predict these responses, I’ve looked at the patterns in your provided data. These students struggle significantly with order of operations (BIDMAS) and fraction denominator rules. 

Specifically, in the calibration questions, we saw a massive "add the denominators" bias in the algebraic fraction question ($D=69\%$ for $\frac{7}{2x}$) and a consistent failure to follow arithmetic priority. For the mixed number addition:

*   **Option A** (Correct): Requires adding whole numbers and numerators correctly while keeping the denominator the same.
*   **Option B** (Improper fraction): Is mathematically correct but violates the instruction to leave it as a "mixed number." In the "Mean" question (0, 1, 3, 4, 7), the students showed they are very susceptible to choosing answers that *look* right but ignore subtle constraints.
*   **Option C** (Adding everything): Adding the whole numbers (3), the numerators (3), and the denominators (10), but then weirdly expressed as an improper fraction.
*   **Option D** (Common Denominator Error): This is the "Attractive Distractor." Like the algebraic fraction question where 69% added denominators, many students will add the 5+5 to get 10.

Based on the 0-1% success rates in your calibration samples, I expect the "Adding Denominators" error (D) to be the dominant choice across all but the top level.
