To calibrate for these students, we must acknowledge a few critical trends from the previous questions:
1. **The Negative Number Trap**: These students consistently struggle with negative signs (e.g., 53% thought $(-3)^4 = -81$, and 99% thought $-1 \times -4 = -5$ because they performed addition instead of multiplication).
2. **BIDMAS/Inversion Weakness**: There is a profound tendency to prioritize addition/subtraction or "clean" numbers over multiplicative logic. 
3. **Overwhelming Distractors**: If an answer looks "symmetrical" or reverses the problem simply, it becomes a "magnet" for students who lack fractional inversion skills.

For $-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$:
- **Option B $(-4/3)$**: Students who recognize the reciprocal but over-correct the sign (expecting a negative result from two negatives).
- **Option C $(3/4)$**: Very common; they see $-\frac{3}{4}$, want it to equal $-1$, and essentially "guess" a number they've already seen or mistakenly try to "cancel" the signs via subtraction logic.
- **Option D $(-3/4)$**: The "Visual Match" trap; if they don't understand fractions, they often pick the number already present.
- **Option A $(4/3)$**: The correct answer.

The data suggests even "Proficient" students in this cohort (the top 10-20% who usually hit the "Difficulty 0%" mark) will struggle here due to the fraction-negative combo.
