Based on the performance data from this cohort, it is clear that these students struggle significantly with order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and fraction arithmetic. Looking at the calibration questions, there is a very high tendency (up to 77–84%) to choose options that represent a "linear" or "intuitive" surface-level operation rather than the mathematically sound one (e.g., adding denominators or ignoring negative signs).

In the case of \( 2 \frac{7}{10} + 2 \frac{1}{4} \):
- **Option D (\( 4 \frac{8}{14} \))** is the "trap" answer. It comes from simply adding the whole numbers (\(2+2=4\)), then adding the numerators (\(7+1=8\)) and adding the denominators (\(10+4=14\)). Based on the performance on the \( 4x+2y=10 \) and order of operation questions, this will be the most popular choice for struggling students.
- **Option B (\( 4 \frac{19}{20} \))** is the correct answer. Given the 0% - 1% success rate on previous conceptual questions, this will be very low across the board.
- **Option A (\( \frac{99}{20} \))** is mathematically equivalent but doesn't meet the "mixed number" instruction, though these students rarely reach this stage.
- **Option C (\( \frac{99}{40} \))** reflects a common error where students convert to improper fractions and multiply denominators without adjusting numerators correctly, or simply get lost in the algorithm.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=5% B=2% C=8% D=85%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=15% D=70%
proficient: A=15% B=12% C=18% D=55%
advanced: A=25% B=28% C=12% D=35%
