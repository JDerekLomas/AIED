To predict these distributions, I’ve analysed the common misconceptions evident in the calibration data. Specifically, I noted:
1.  **Negative number neglect:** Students struggle significantly with directed numbers (see the sphere $k^4$ and the equation $10x-6y=30$ where they ignored the sign of the constant or term).
2.  **Arithmetic precedence (BIDMAS) errors:** There is a heavy tendency to work left-to-right regardless of operators.
3.  **Expansion errors:** Many students likely remember the "middle term" comes from addition but lose the signs in the constant term.

In $(m-5)(m-7)$:
- **B (Correct)** requires $-5 \times -7 = +35$ and $-5 - 7 = -12$.
- **D (Attractive Distractor)** is the most common error: students correctly add $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$ but assume a negative times a negative is a negative, or simply "keep the minus sign" from the brackets ($5 \times 7 = 35$, keep the minus).
- **C** is for students who ignore the negatives entirely.
- **A** is for students who struggle with the linear term (subtracting $5$ from $7$).

Given the very high error rates in the calibration questions for directed numbers (only 20% getting $(-3)^4$ correct), even the "advanced" group will struggle here with the double negative.

basic: A=12% B=18% C=15% D=55%
proficient: A=8% B=35% C=10% D=47%
advanced: A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%
