To calibrate for these students, we must acknowledge a few glaring trends from your marked papers:
1. **The "Zero is Nothing" Fallacy**: Students frequently ignore zero as a significant number in counts (as seen in the $4x+2y=10$ question where 77% chose $D$, likely from a misunderstanding of how 0 interacts with the equation or number of terms).
2. **BIDMAS Blindness**: There is a profound struggle with the order of operations. In your data, 92% failed to use fractions/brackets for division, and 76% incorrectly performed addition before subtraction or multiplication.
3. **Overthinking Simple Concepts**: Paradoxically, many students select "None/Neither" or "No solution" when a problem looks slightly unconventional (88% on the Tom/Katie question; 59% on $10=5/p$).

For this Mean question:
- **Option A** is mathematically correct because $(0+1+3+4+7)$ is the same as $(1+3+4+7)$, and dividing by 5 counts the zero. However, students who believe "0 doesn't count" will avoid it because the 0 is missing from the numerator.
- **Option B** is a classic BIDMAS trap. These students perform the addition on their calculator or on paper, but because the division symbol is only attached to the 7, it is mathematically incorrect. Given that 76% failed the "what comes first" BIDMAS question, this will be the most attractive "wrong" looking correct method.
- **Option C** attracts those who think the 0 doesn't count towards the "number of values," resulting in a division by 4.
- **Option D** is the most likely "catch-all" for these students who see flaws in all options (e.g., "A is missing 0," "B doesn't have brackets," "C has the wrong denominator").
