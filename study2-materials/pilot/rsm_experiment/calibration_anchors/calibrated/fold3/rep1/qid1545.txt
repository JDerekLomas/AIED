Based on the response patterns seen in the previous questions, particularly the students' heavy reliance on reading operations from left to right regardless of BIDMAS/Order of Operations, here is the calibration for this question.

The left side ($8 + 12 \div 4$) is correctly 11, but the "attractive" error is to do $20 \div 4 = 5$.
The right side ($(8 + 12) \div 4$) is clearly 5.

Students who make the left-to-right error on the first expression will see $5 \square 5$ and choose 'equal'. Given that 92% of this cohort chose an incorrect algebraic convention and 76% chose a left-to-right calculation over BIDMAS in Question P/Q, the "C" (equal) distractor will be extremely dominant.
