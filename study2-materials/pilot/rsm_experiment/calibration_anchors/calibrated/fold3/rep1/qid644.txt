To predict the performance for this question, we must look at the specific misconceptions evident in the calibration data. 

In the previous questions, students showed a heavy reliance on "surface-level" operations and common negative number errors. For example, 53% thought $(-3)^4 = -81$, showing a struggle with negatives. In the BIDMAS question, 76% failed to recognize that addition/subtraction are of equal priority, and 47% in the $3-5+4\times2$ question likely ignored priority or calculated in a way that resulted in an incorrect order of operations.

For this specific question:
- **Option A (+4):** Correct $(-1 \times -4)$.
- **Option B (-4):** Neglecting the "double negative" rule.
- **Option C (+5):** Misinterpreting "expanding/multiplying" and actually adding the numbers $(-1 + -4 = -5)$, then potentially ignoring the sign.
- **Option D (-5):** The most common error in this cohort: **adding** instead of multiplying, while correctly processing the sign $(-1 + -4 = -5)$. Given that 88% failed to solve $\frac{x}{3}-5=12$ because they likely simplified or mismanaged the structure, "adding" terms in a bracket expansion is an extremely attractive distractor for lower ability levels.
