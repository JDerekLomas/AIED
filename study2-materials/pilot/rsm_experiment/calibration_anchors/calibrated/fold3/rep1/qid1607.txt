Based on the calibration data, several clear patterns emerge in this Year 9 cohort:
1. **Misconceptions about Equality:** In the calibration questions (e.g., $10 = \frac{5}{p}$), 59% of students chose "No solution" and many struggled with isolating variables.
2. **"Left-to-Right" Preference:** Students have a very strong tendency to perform operations in linear order, regardless of algebraic logic or BIDMAS (as seen in the BIDMAS questions and the fractional addition errors).
3. **The Inverse Operation Trap:** There is a significant pattern of applying the *wrong* inverse operation when "moving" a number to the other side (e.g., the $\frac{x}{3}-5=12$ question where 88% thought both or neither were correct, failing to see the simple $+5$ as valid).
4. **Calculational Blindness:** Step 2 ($60 = 1 + k \implies 61 = k$) involves adding 1 instead of subtracting. In the calibration set, the majority of students (85%) picked the answer that resulted from a sign error (Question 2: $x= -4.25$ instead of $3.3$).

In this question, Step 1 is correct (multiplication by 4). Step 2 is incorrect (adds 1 instead of subtracting). However, looking at previous responses (like $3-5+4\times 2$), many students in this group seem to perform the first "natural" operation they see without checking the validity of the inverse.

The "Advanced" students are likely to spot the error in Step 2, but the "Below Basic" and "Basic" tiers are highly likely to see a "60", a "1", and a "61" and assume the logic holds because the numbers "fit" together additively.

below_basic: A=10% B=5% C=75% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=5% C=65% D=10%
proficient: A=35% B=5% C=50% D=10%
advanced: A=65% B=5% C=20% D=10%
