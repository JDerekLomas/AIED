Based on the calibration data, several clear patterns emerge in this cohort's performance:
1.  **BODMAS/BIDMAS Weakness:** The most significant finding is that 76-92% of students across multiple questions ignore order of operations, preferring to work strictly from left to right (seen in the \(4-5+6\) and \(c \div(h+4)\) questions).
2.  **Arithmetic Errors:** Even with "simple" sums, students frequently fail to process the final result if it feels "wrong" (only 1% got the order of operations correct on the \(3-5+4 \times 2\) question).
3.  **Left-to-Right Preference:** For the expression \(8+12 \div 4\), the vast majority of these students will calculate \((8+12) \div 4 = 5\), making the left side identical to the right side.

For this specific question:
-   **Correct Logic (A):** \(8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11\). Since \(11 > 5\), the answer is A.
-   **Left-to-Right Error (C):** \((8+12) \div 4 = 5\). Since \(5 = 5\), students will choose C.
-   **Operation Confusion (B):** Some may miscalculate \(12 \div 4\) or invert the inequality.

Given that only 14% identified the correct first step in BIDMAS (Problem Q) and only 1% solved the multi-step BIDMAS problem correctly, "Option C" is the massive distractor here.
