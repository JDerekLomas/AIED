To predict the performance for the calculation $(-1) \times (-4)$, we must look at the patterns in the calibration data. 

Specifically:
- **Operation Confusion:** In the $4-5+6$ and $3-5+4 \times 2$ questions, students showed a massive tendency to ignore order of operations or sign rules in favour of "natural" pairings.
- **Negative Number Handling:** In the $k^4$ where $k=-3$ question, 59% of students missed the sign (getting -81 or other).
- **Additive vs Multiplicative:** The most "attractive" wrong answer in Year 9 expansion questions is often adding the terms instead of multiplying them.

**Error Analysis:**
- **A (+4):** Correct. Multiplied and applied sign rules correctly.
- **B (-4):** Multiplied correctly but failed on the "negative $\times$ negative" sign rule.
- **C (+5):** Added the numbers $(-1) + (-4)$ to get $-5$, then erroneously applied a "two negatives make a positive" rule to the result.
- **D (-5):** Simply added the two numbers together $(-1) + (-4) = -5$. This is the most common error in "expanding brackets" for lower-attaining students.

Given that 92% of students chose an incorrect "natural" look for algebraic fractions and 85% failed to handle a decimal substitution, we can expect significant grouping around the additive answers (C and D).
