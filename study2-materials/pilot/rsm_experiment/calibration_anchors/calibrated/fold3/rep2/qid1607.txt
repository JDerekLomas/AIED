Based on the performance data from the calibration questions, we can observe several clear trends in this cohort:
1. **BIDMAS/Inversion Blindness:** Students consistently fail to apply the order of operations correctly when rearranging or solving (as seen in the 76% error on $4-5+6$ and the 92% error on algebraic notation).
2. **"Opposite" Confusion:** There is a heavy reliance on doing "the opposite" of what is seen without logic—if they see a subtraction in the step ($60=1+k$, requiring $-1$), they are highly likely to add instead, simply because they recognize it as an equation.
3. **Overconfidence in Finality:** In the $10=\frac{5}{p}$ question, 59% said "no solution" and 15% said 50. This cohort struggles immensely with division and denominators.

In the target question, Step 1 is correct (multiplied by 4). Step 2 is incorrect (added 1 instead of subtracting 1). Given that only 8% got the "Tom and Katie" question right (where "Both" or "Neither" were magnetic traps), and 85% fell for the wrong sign in the substitution question, we can expect "Both" to be an extremely attractive distractor here.

Here is the predicted distribution:
