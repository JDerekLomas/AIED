Based on the performance data from this cohort, it is clear that these students struggle significantly with order of operations (BIDMAS) and algebraic conventions, but show a reasonable grasp of basic arithmetic.

For this specific question:
- **Option A** is the correct answer. Even though 0 is included in the set, the sum of $\{0, 1, 3, 4, 7\}$ is the same as $\{1, 3, 4, 7\}$, and the count of values is indeed 5.
- **Option B** is a highly "attractive" distractor. Given the cohort's performance on BIDMAS (92% choosing the wrong algebraic convention for division and 76% failing to identify $4-5$ as the first step over $4+5$), many students will write the mean out as a linear string without brackets, not realising that only the 7 is being divided by 5.
- **Option C** represents a conceptual misunderstanding of the mean where the '0' is ignored in the denominator (counting only the non-zero items).
- **Option D** is likely to be chosen by students who believe the 0 *must* be written in the numerator for the calculation to be "correct".

The difficulty of this question lies in the "invisibility" of the zero and the conventions of horizontal division.
