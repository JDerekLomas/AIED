To predict the performance of this Year 9 cohort, we must look at the trends established in the calibration questions:
1.  **Negative Number Misconceptions:** These students struggle significantly with directed numbers. In the question \(k^4\) where \(k=-3\), 53% chose \(-81\). In the \(3-5+4\times 2\) question, nearly 50% failed to handle the negative/subtraction correctly.
2.  **Order of Operations / Basic Arithmetic Flow:** Students often calculate left-to-right regardless of rules or ignore the secondary operation's effect on signs. 
3.  **Expansion/Multiplication Patterns:** In the sphere and table questions, we see a tendency to gravitate towards the most "visually balanced" or simplest-looking term, often ignoring the double negative rule.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A (\(m^2 - 2m - 35\)):** The result of \(7-5\) for the middle term and multiplying \(-5 \times -7\) to get \(-35\).
*   **B (\(m^2 - 12m + 35\)):** The correct answer.
*   **C (\(m^2 + 12m + 35\)):** Ignoring the negative signs during addition but getting the product right.
*   **D (\(m^2 - 12m - 35\)):** The "classic" error—successfully adding \(-5\) and \(-7\) but failing the double negative multiplication (\(-5 \times -7 = -35\)).

Based on the 88% failure rate on "Tom/Katie" and the 76% error rate on BIDMAS order, Option D will be the "attractive distractor" for this cohort.
