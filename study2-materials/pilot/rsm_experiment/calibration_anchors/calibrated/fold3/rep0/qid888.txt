Based on the calibration data, these students struggle significantly with directed numbers (e.g., \( -3^4 \), \( 3-5+4\times2 \)) and often pick answers that "look" like a familiar operation without checking signs carefully. In the expansion of \((m-5)(m-7)\), the "12" and "35" will be easily identified, but the sign of the constant term (\(-5 \times -7\)) and the linear term (\(-5 -7\)) will provide significant distractors.

Option D is particularly "attractive" to lower-ability students because they often associate a minus in the bracket with a minus in the final product. Option C attracts those who struggle with adding negatives. Option B is the correct answer.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=25% D=50%
basic: A=12% B=22% C=18% D=48%
proficient: A=8% B=45% C=12% D=35%
advanced: A=5% B=78% C=5% D=12%
