To predict the performance for this question, we must look at the specific misconceptions evidenced in your calibration data. 

**Misconception Analysis:**
- **Option A (The Correct Method):** Even though 0 has no numerical value in addition, it is a data point that must be counted in the divisor. In your calibration data (e.g., the $c \div (h+4)$ and BIDMAS questions), students showed a massive failure to recognize how division interacts with addition and grouping. 
- **Option B (The Calculator/Notation Error):** This mimics the "92% incorrect" response on the algebraic convention question. Students frequently ignore the need for brackets/vinculum, performing $7 \div 5$ first.
- **Option C (The "Ignore Zero" Error):** This is the most "mathematically" attractive wrong answer. Many Year 9s believe that because 0 doesn't change the sum, it shouldn't be included in the count. Given the $4+2y=10$ question where 77% chose $2.5$ (failing to handle the 0 term correctly), this is a high-risk error.
- **Option D (The "None" Trap):** As seen in the $10=5/p$ question where 59% chose "No solutions", these students often default to "None" if the formatting doesn't perfectly match their internal mental model (which usually involves a $0$ being explicitly written in the numerator).

**Comparison:** This question is more accessible than the sphere or the fractions questions, but contains the "invisible grouping" trap which devastated the cohorts in the calibration set.
