Based on the response patterns of this cohort, these students frequently struggle with signs (as seen in the $k=-3$ question) and operation choice (as seen in the BIDMAS and division/addition errors).

The distractors represent common misconceptions:
- **A (Correct):** Students must know that $-1 \times -4 = +4$.
- **B (Sign error):** Students multiply but believe the product stays negative.
- **C (Operation error):** Students add the absolute values (1 and 4) but ignore signs or confuse rules.
- **D (Sum/Sign error):** Students perform $(-1) + (-4)$ instead of multiplication, a very common error in bracket expansion.

Looking at the calibration data where 88% of students missed a simple 1-step linear rearrangement and 75% missed $3 \times 0.3^2$, we can expect a heavy lean toward the additive errors (C and D).
