Based on the calibration data, several clear patterns emerge in this cohort's performance:
1.  **Heavy reliance on left-to-right processing:** The students consistently ignore order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). In the problem $4+5 \times 6$, 76% chose to do $4+5$ first. In $3-5+4 \times 2$, 81% (options B and D combined) ignored the priority of multiplication.
2.  **Weakness in algebraic notation/division:** Many students struggled with fractional forms and reciprocal logic ($10 = 5/p$).
3.  **Predicting the Error for this Question:**
    *   **LHS ($8+12 \div 4$):** Most students will calculate $20 \div 4 = 5$. Only the higher ability students will correctly identify $8 + 3 = 11$.
    *   **RHS ($(8+12) \div 4$):** Almost all students will calculate $20 \div 4 = 5$ because of the brackets.
    *   **The Trap:** Because students naturally gravitate toward $20 \div 4$ on the LHS (ignoring BIDMAS), a vast majority will conclude that $5 = 5$ and choose Option C.

Here are the predicted response distributions:

below_basic: A=2% B=4% C=92% D=2%
