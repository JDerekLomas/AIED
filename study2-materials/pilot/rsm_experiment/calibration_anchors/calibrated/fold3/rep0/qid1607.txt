Based on the performance data from your Year 9 mock cohort, here is the predicted distribution for Isaac’s equation problem.

This question targets a very specific and common misconception observed in the calibration data (specifically looking at the results for \(10=\frac{5}{p}\) and \(\frac{x}{3}-5=12\)). Students in this cohort frequently perform the inverse operation on the number (the magnitude) rather than the equation, or they "undo" steps using the wrong sign. In Step 2, Isaac adds 1 to both sides instead of subtracting. Given that 88% of your students failed to identify a correct algebraic step in the Tom/Katie question, and 59% believed an equation like \(10=\frac{5}{p}\) had no solution or gave up, Step 2's error (adding 1) will be highly "attractive" because it "looks" like math is happening.

**Analysis of Errors:**
- **A (Correct):** Students recognize Step 1 is valid (multiplication) but spot the sign error in Step 2.
- **C (Common Error):** Students see Step 1 is correct and assume the "61" must follow logically because they intuitively add rather than subtract, or fail to check the inverse operation.
- **D (Skepticism/Mistrust):** Students who struggle with fractions often assume any step involving multiplying the whole number by the denominator is "cheating" or wrong (as seen in the 88% D response rate on the Tom/Katie question).
