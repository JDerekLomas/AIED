Based on the calibration data, this Year 9 cohort struggles significantly with reciprocal relationships, order of operations, and equations where the variable is on the bottom of a fraction.

In the calibration question $15 = \frac{1+k}{4}$, $75\%$ of students believed Isaac's correct step ($60=1+k$) was actually incorrect. Furthermore, in the question $3p = \frac{1}{12}$, a large majority ($86\%$) correctly identified $p = \frac{1}{36}$, showing they are comfortable multiplying the denominator. However, for $10 = \frac{5}{p}$, the "attractive" error is to treat the relationship as $10 \div 5$ (leading to $p=2$) or $10 \times 5$ (leading to $p=50$).

Given that only $10\%$ of these students correctly identified a coordinate for $4x+2y=10$, we can expect a very high "intuitive error" rate here. Option C ($p=2$) is the most attractive trap, as students often perform the operation $10 \div 5$ regardless of the variable's position.
