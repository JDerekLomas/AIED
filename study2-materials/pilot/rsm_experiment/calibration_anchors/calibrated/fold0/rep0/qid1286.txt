To predict the performance for this cohort, we must look at the specific misconceptions evident in the calibration data. This group shows a profound struggle with **the order of operations** (e.g., 92% failing to recognize division as a fraction line) and **inverse operations in equations** (e.g., 75% thinking $15 = \frac{1+k}{4}$ leads to adding $1$ before multiplying by $4$).

For the sphere question ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$), the students must multiply by $3$ and divide by $4\pi$.
*   **Option C** is the correct inverse.
*   **Option A** is the "Multiplication Misconception": Students who think "inverse everything" means multiplying everything together ($4 \times V \times \pi$).
*   **Option B** is the "Partial Inverse": Students who know to divide by the coefficients but keep the $4/3$ fraction orientation because it "looks right."
*   **Option D** is a structural error common in the $c \div (h+4)$ question, where they move numbers around without regard for the radical's scope.

Given that 84% of these students failed a basic inequality with brackets and 75% failed a basic $y = 3x^2$ substitution, this rearrangement task is extremely high-level for them.
