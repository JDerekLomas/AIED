To calibrate the performance of this specific cohort, it is clear they struggle significantly with the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the structural rules of algebra. Specifically:

*   They tend to perform operations in left-to-right order regardless of rules (as seen in $3-5+4 \times 2$).
*   They fail to distribute multiplication over addition/subtraction (seen in the $15 = \frac{1+k}{4}$ question, where 75% missed the step involving subtracting 1 from 60).
*   They frequently choose "intuitive" but mathematically incorrect shortcuts.

For the question regarding Tom and Katie:
- **Tom's method** ($+5$ to both sides) is standard and correct.
- **Katie's method** ($ \times 3$ to both sides) is a very common "trap." Most students in this cohort forget to multiply the constant ($-5$) by 3, making her method appear correct to those who lack conceptual understanding of "doing the same thing to both sides" of an entire expression.
- Given the 75% error rate on the Isaac ($15 = \frac{1+k}{4}$) question and the 92% error rate on the $c \div (h+4)$ algebraic notation, students are highly likely to believe Katie is correct.
