Right, I’ve just finished the 200th paper. If these mock results tell me anything, it's that this Year 9 cohort has a real "allergy" to algebraic order of operations and a strong tendency to "simplify" things by just adding whatever numbers they see first.

Looking at the calibration data:
1. They consistently add denominators when they shouldn't (seen in the $4 \frac{8}{14}$ fraction attempt and the mean question).
2. They are terrified of denominators that aren't "just $x$" (seen in the $c \div(h+4)$ and the $15 = \frac{1+k}{4}$ questions).
3. Many ignore common denominators and just add across ($3+4=7$).

For $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$:
- **Option B ($7/3x$):** The ultimate "classic" Year 9 mistake. They add the numerators ($3+4$) and the denominators ($2x+x$). Given their previous performance on "adding everything across," this will be very popular for the middle-to-lower range.
- **Option A ($11/2x$):** The correct method ($\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$). Given that literally 0% to 1% got several BIDMAS and algebraic substitution questions right, I expect the "Correct" answer percentage to be extremely low.
- **Option D ($7/2x$):** They notice $2x$ is a common denominator but forget to adjust the second numerator. "I want the bottom to be $2x$, so it is, and I'll just add the top."
- **Option C ($11/x$):** A confusion where they get the numerator right but drop the 2 from the denominator.

This question is harder than the fractional addition they failed (Question 13), so I expect the correct response rate to be very low.
