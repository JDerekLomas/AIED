Right, let's look at this one. Having just marked 200 of these, the "Year 9 logic" is very clear.

The calibration data shows some terrifying trends: our students are consistently struggling with order of operations (92% getting the algebraic convention for division wrong), and they have a massive tendency to simply add across numerators and denominators when they see fractions. Looking at the Molly expansion question (99% choosing -5 for -1 × -4) and the mean question (62% ignoring the zero), they often prioritize the "easiest" looking arithmetic path rather than the correct rules.

For $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$:
- **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$)** is the "classic" mistake: add the top ($3+4$), add the bottom ($2x+x$). Given how they handled the mixed numbers and mean questions, this will be hugely popular for lower ability sets.
- **Option A ($\frac{11}{2x}$)** is the correct answer. It requires a common denominator.
- **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$)** is a hybrid error: they correctly identify $2x$ as the common denominator but forget to multiply the numerator of the second fraction. This is an "attractive" middle-ground error.
- **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$)** is less common, usually from students who somehow think they can discard the 2.

Based on the 0-1% pass rates on the other logic-heavy questions, I expect the "add everything" approach to dominate.
