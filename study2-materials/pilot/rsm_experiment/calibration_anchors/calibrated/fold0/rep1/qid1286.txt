To calibrate my predictions for this Year 9 cohort, I’ve noted several critical trends from the previous questions:
1.  **Inverse Operation Blindness**: In the equation $15 = (1+k)/4$, 75% of students failed to spot a simple subtraction error in step 2.
2.  **BIDMAS/Notation Vulnerability**: 92% chose $c/h+4$ for $c \div (h+4)$, and 76% failed to apply BIDMAS correctly even when prompted (Question P/Q). 
3.  **Rearranging vs. Multiplied coefficients**: In the sphere formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, the "3" and "4" are frequently misplaced. Students often feel that "bigger" numbers or the subject ($V$) should remain "on top" or move in ways that don't involve the reciprocal.

For the sphere radius question:
- **Option C** is the correct rearrangement.
- **Option A** is the most "natural" wrong choice because students often simply multiply all known terms together $(4 \times V \times \pi)$ rather than applying inverse operations.
- **Option B** reflects a partial understanding (dividing by $\pi$) but failing to handle the fraction $4/3$ correctly.
- **Option D** represents a common "linear" formatting error seen in lower-attaining students who aren't comfortable with nested roots.

Given that only 3% could identify a one-step linear error in the Isaac question, I expect the "Correct" response (C) to be extremely low across the board for this more complex literal equation.
