Based on the response patterns seen in the calibration questions, here is the analysis of this specific problem.

**Analysis of Errors:**
- **Option B ($p=50$):** This is the most "attractive" error. Based on the $3p = 1/12$ and $15 = (1+k)/4$ questions, many students reflexively multiply the two visible numbers ($10 \times 5$) without considering the algebraic structure of the fraction denominator.
- **Option C ($p=2$):** This represents a "reverse division" error. Students see 10 and 5 and perform $10 \div 5 = 2$ because 10 is the larger number and they are accustomed to $x$ being on the top. 
- **Option A ($p=0.5$):** This is the correct answer. Given that students failed significantly on $4x+2y=10$ (choosing $D=2.5$ over $C=5$) and struggled with simple order of operations, this transformation ($10p = 5 \implies p = 0.5$) is likely to be missed by the vast majority.

**Comparison:** This question is mechanically similar to the $3p = 1/12$ question (where students surprisingly did well) but the variable being in the denominator makes it much closer in difficulty to the Isaac/Equation-Solving question ($15 = (1+k)/4$), where $75\%$ chose the wrong path.
