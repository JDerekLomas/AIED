Based on the performance data from the previous questions, this cohort exhibits significant issues with multi-step substitution and basic arithmetic order of operations. 

Looking at the specific errors for $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$:
- **Option C (3.3):** This is the most "attractive" distractor. Students calculate $10x - 3 = 30$ but then perform $(30+3) \div 10 = 3.3$. While it shows some algebraic process, many students in the lower brackets struggle with any decimal multiplication involving negative coefficients.
- **Option D (2.7):** This arises from $10x + 3 = 30$, leading to $27/10$. This is a very common sign error (ignoring the negative or adding instead of subtracting to "balance").
- **Option A (4.25):** Students do $30 \div 6 = 5$, then adjust for the 0.5. Or they confuse $6 \times 0.5$ as something yielding a calculation involving $30 + 12.5$.
- **Option B (-4.25):** Often a blind guess or a sign confusion based on the $-6y$ term.

Given that 77% of this group failed to substitute $x=0$ correctly in $4x+2y=10$, and 75% failed $3x^2$ where $x=0.3$, this question—requiring substitution of a decimal $y$ to find $x$—is exceptionally high-difficulty for them.
