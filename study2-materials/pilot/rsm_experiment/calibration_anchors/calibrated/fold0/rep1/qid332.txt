To calibrate the predictions, I’ve looked at the patterns in your Year 9 cohort. Notably:
*   **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) is a significant weakness:** They struggled heavily with \(5+6\) vs \(4-5\) and general BIDMAS (see the \(3-5+4 \times 2\) question).
*   **Expansion/Isolation of terms:** A huge 75% incorrectly identified step 2 in Isaac’s equation solving, and 92% failed on the algebraic convention for division.
*   **Multiplying across terms:** The student responses to Isaac’s question ($15=\frac{1+k}{4}$) show they often forget to multiply *every* term or fail to understand the order of inverse operations. 

In this question, Katie’s error is the "attractive" one: multiplying by 3 but forgetting to multiply the $-5$ as well. Given that 75% of your students thought Isaac was correct when he made a similar isolation error, Option C (Both) and Option B (Only Katie) will be very popular traps. Tom’s correct move (adding 5) actually requires a stronger grasp of the priority of operations in reverse.

Here are my predictions for the percentage distributions:

below_basic: A=5% B=45% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=15% B=30% C=50% D=5%
advanced: A=25% B=20% C=52% D=3%
