Right, I’ve just finished the marking, and if those first 200 papers taught me anything, it's that this cohort has some very specific "habits." They are struggling significantly with order of operations and algebraic conventions, but they are also making very "consistent" errors.

In this algebraic fraction question, we have a classic showdown between the "add the tops, add the bottoms" trap and a failure to find a common denominator. 

Looking at the options:
- **B (7/3x)** is the absolute "hallway" answer—adding across the top (3+4) and adding across the bottom (2x+x). Given how many of them struggled with the $c \div (h+4)$ notation, this feels very "natural" to them.
- **A (11/2x)** is the correct answer ($\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}$). 
- **C (11/x)** suggests they found the common denominator was $2x$ but then forgot the $2$ on the bottom during the final step.
- **D (7/2x)** is the "I know the bottom stays the same but I forgot to multiply the numerator" mistake.

Based on the fact that 92% thought $c/h + 4$ was the same as $c \div (h+4)$, and nearly everyone missed the order of operations in basic arithmetic, I expect "B" to be overwhelmingly popular across the lower bands.

below_basic: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
basic: A=8% B=62% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
advanced: A=45% B=20% C=15% D=20%
