Based on the response patterns of these specific students—who consistently struggle with the order of operations, algebraic conventions, and isolating variables across multi-step equations—here is the predicted distribution for the question regarding Tom and Katie's working.

The calibration data shows a massive tendency (75-92%) to ignore order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) or incorrectly apply the same operation to only part of an expression (as seen in the Isaac/equation question). Katie's error—multiplying the constant and the result by 3 while leaving the $x$ term untouched—will feel highly "natural" to this cohort, even though it violates the balance of the equation.

**Calculation Errors:**
- **Tom (Correct):** Adding 5 to both sides first ($12 + 5 = 17$).
- **Katie (Error):** Attempting to multiply by 3 but failing to distribute it to the $-5$ term, resulting in $x - 5 = 36$ instead of $x - 15 = 36$.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=12% B=48% C=32% D=8%
proficient: A=15% B=45% C=30% D=10%
advanced: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%

**Reasoning:**
Across all levels, this cohort shows a strong "left-to-right" bias and a weak grasp of how multipliers apply to entire sides of an equation. In the Isaac question, 75% thought both steps were incorrect or focused on the wrong part; similarly, in the mean question, 62% ignored the 0. Katie’s "working" looks like a simple multiplication ($12 \times 3$), which will attract a majority of students. Only a small fraction will correctly identify Tom as the sole provider of valid working, as the "Only Tom" option requires resisting the surface-level logic of Katie’s $12 \times 3 = 36$.
