To calibrate my predictions for this Year 9 cohort, I’ve analysed the common threads in their previous responses. This group struggles significantly with multi-step algebraic manipulation, BIDMAS/order of operations (e.g., the 75% error on $3 \times 0.3^2$ and 92% error on algebraic notation), and isolating variables (as seen in the Isaac equation question). 

For the sphere volume question ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$), they must multiply by 3 and divide by $4\pi$.
- **Option C (Correct):** Requires three distinct inverse operations in the correct order. Given that only 3% correctly identified the first step in solving a fractional equation (Isaac), this is very high-demand.
- **Option A:** The most common "mis-multiplication" where students see a fraction and multiply the wrong side by the numerator or keep the $\pi$ on top ($4V\pi/3$).
- **Option B:** A very attractive distractor where they move the 4 and the $\pi$ correctly but fail to handle the $1/3$ correctly (or multiply $V$ by $4/3$).
- **Option C:** High-performing students only.
- **Option D:** A "visual scramble" that looks "mathsy" but ignores the mechanics of isolating $r^3$.

Given that many of these students failed even the simplest "mixed number addition" (difficulty 0%), I expect a very high guessing rate and a strong preference for options that "look" like the original formula rearranged poorly.
