Based on the performance data from the previous questions, this cohort exhibits significant struggles with substituting into equations (as seen in the $4x+2y=10$ and $y=3x^2$ questions) and consistently defaults to left-to-right operations or "visual" arithmetic rather than inverse algebraic steps.

The distractors for $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30$ are designed as follows:
- **A (4.25):** Wrong step in solving. $10x = 30 + 3 \rightarrow 10x = 33 \rightarrow x = 3.3$. Option A represents the calculation $10(4.25) = 42.5; 42.5 - 10 = 32.5$, but more likely students arriving at 3.3 and picking something that looks "mathematical" or attempting $10x - 6.5$.
- **C (3.3):** The correct answer. Given only 10% got the first table question right and 3% got the Isaac equation right, I expect low accuracy here.
- **D (2.7):** The most "attractive" error. Students subtract 3 instead of adding it: $10x = 30 - 3 \rightarrow 10x = 27 \rightarrow x = 2.7$. This matches the "add means subtract/subtract means add" confusion seen in the $15 = (1+k)/4$ question (where 75% picked $D$).

Here is the predicted distribution:
