To predict the performance for $T = k^4$ where $k = -3$, we must consider the trends seen in the calibration data. 

In this cohort, students consistently struggle with directed numbers (see the expansion question where 99% chose $-5$ over $+4$) and the priority of operations/structure (see the mean and fraction questions). 

**The Distractors:**
*   **C (-81):** This is the most "attractive" error. Many students (even those who know $3^4 = 81$) incorrectly apply the negative sign at the end or believe a negative base raised to an even power remains negative.
*   **D (-12):** This attracts "Below Basic" students who confuse powers with multiplication ($-3 \times 4 = -12$).
*   **B (12):** Similar to D, but failing to manage the negative sign at all ($3 \times 4 = 12$).
*   **A (81):** The correct answer, which requires both the calculation of $3^4$ and the knowledge that a negative base to an even power is positive.

Given that 88% of these students thought $(8+12)\div 4$ was equal to $8+12\div 4$, and 99% missed a basic $(-1) \times (-4)$ sign change, the negative exponentiation will be very poorly handled.

below_basic: A=2% B=15% C=38% D=45%
basic: A=5% B=8% C=62% D=25%
proficient: A=12% B=3% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=35% B=0% C=65% D=0%
