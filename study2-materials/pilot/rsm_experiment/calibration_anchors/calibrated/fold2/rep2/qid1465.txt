To predict the performance of this Year 9 cohort, we must look at their previous behaviour. They have consistently struggled with order of operations (84% failed to identify that brackets change an outcome) and negative numbers (99% failed to identify $(-1) \times (-4) = +4$).

In this question: $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2$
- **Correct (A):** $3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = 6$ (Requires BIDMAS and negative number competence).
- **L-to-R error (B):** $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$ (Extremely common).
- **Addition first error (C):** $5+4=9$, then $3-9 = -6$, then $-6 \times 2 = -12$.
- **BIDMAS then subtraction error (D):** $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - (5+8) = 3 - 13 = -10$ (Common mistake of "Adding" before "Subtracting" due to the 'A' appearing before 'S' in BIDMAS).

Based on the data showing these students often ignore formal algebraic rules in favour of "natural" left-to-right processing or misinterpreted order of operations:

below_basic: A=5% B=45% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=25% D=25%
proficient: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
advanced: A=45% B=15% C=15% D=25%
