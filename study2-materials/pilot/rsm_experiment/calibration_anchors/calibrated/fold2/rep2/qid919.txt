To predict the performance for $y = 3x^2$ where $x = 0.3$, we must consider the specific misconceptions evidenced in your previous calibration data:

1.  **BIDMAS/Order of Operations:** Students in this cohort frequently struggle with priority. For $3(0.3)^2$, many will calculate $(3 \times 0.3)^2$, leading to $0.9^2 = 0.81$. Given that $99\%$ of these students failed to identify $-1 \times -4 = +4$ and $84\%$ missed a basic BIDMAS comparison, "A" is a high-probability trap.
2.  **Squaring Decimals:** There is a strong tendency to treat $0.3^2$ as $0.9$ (ignoring place value), which leads to $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$. In the calibration, $69\%$ added fractions by adding numerators and ignoring common denominators—suggesting poor decimal/fraction place-value sense.
3.  **The Correct Answer (B):** Only the most advanced students will correctly square $0.3$ to get $0.09$ and then multiply by $3$ to get $0.27$.

Comparison to calibration: $x-6y=30$ had an $85\%$ "sign error" rate (Option B). In this case, the most natural-feeling wrong path is applying the square to the product $3x$ or failing place value in the squaring process.
