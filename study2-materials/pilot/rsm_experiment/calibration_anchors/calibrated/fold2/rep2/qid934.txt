To calibrate for these Year 9 results, we must acknowledge a specific pattern: these students struggle significantly with multi-step logic and inverse operations, often choosing answers based on "surface-level" operations (like seeing $10$ and $4$ and thinking subtraction or division) or incorrectly applying BIDMAS rules.

For the question $4x + 2y = 10$ where $x = 0$:
- **A) 20:** Obtained by incorrectly multiplying $4 \times 5$ (if they think $y$ is 5 and mistakenly multiply the right side) or misinterpreting the relation.
- **B) 3:** A very "attractive" wrong answer. Students often see $4+2=6$, then try to find a number that makes $10$. Or they solve $4(1)+2y=10 \Rightarrow 2y=6 \Rightarrow y=3$, using the $x=1$ column instead of the $x=0$ column.
- **C) 5:** The correct answer ($2y=10 \Rightarrow y=5$).
- **D) 2.5:** A common error where students ignore the $2y$ and $x$ and simply divide $10$ by $4$.

Looking at the calibration data (e.g., the 88% who failed to solve $x/3 - 5 = 12$ and the 99% who missed a simple sign change in expansion), these students frequently gravitate toward the most visually "different" or complex-looking distractors, but often miss the simplest substitution step. However, $x=0$ is usually the "easiest" substitution, which should see slightly better results than the $10x - 6y = 30$ (where they only got 10% correct).

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=5% D=50%
basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=40% C=45% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=18% C=75% D=5%
