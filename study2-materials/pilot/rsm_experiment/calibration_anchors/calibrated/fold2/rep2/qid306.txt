To predict the performance of this Year 9 cohort, we must look at the trends established in the calibration data. This specific group shows several distinct patterns:
1.  **Over-reliance on BIDMAS mnemonics over order of operations**: In the $8+12 \div 4 \dots$ question, 84% chose 'Greater than', likely calculating $20 \div 4$. In the Mean question, 62% ignored the zero (C), and in the expansion question, 99% incorrectly handled signs (D).
2.  **The "A before S" and "D before M" Trap**: Many students interpret BIDMAS/BODMAS as a literal hierarchy where Addition *must* come before Subtraction, rather than moving left-to-right.
3.  **Fragmented Algebra/Arithmetic Skills**: They often choose answers that involve "adding the next numbers they see."

In Problem P ($4-5+6$), the common misconception is that because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in BIDMAS, $5+6$ must be performed first. In Problem Q ($4+5 \times 6$), BIDMAS correctly suggests multiplication first, but weaker students often work strictly left-to-right ($4+5$ first).

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **Option D (The 'BIDMAS Trap'):** Interprets BIDMAS as $5+6$ first, then $5 \times 6$. Based on the calibration (84% getting BIDMAS order wrong in the sphere/division questions), this will be highly attractive.
*   **Option B (Correct):** Left-to-right for P, BIDMAS for Q. 
*   **Option A (Strict Left-to-Right):** $4-5$ first, then $4+5$.
*   **Option C:** Generally illogical but fits those who strictly prioritize addition above all else.
