Based on the calibration data, these Year 9 students struggle significantly with order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and structural algebra. Specifically, there is a very strong "left-to-right" bias (as seen in the $c \div (h+4)$ and mean questions) and a persistent misunderstanding of how to handle addition/subtraction priority when they appear together.

In **Problem P** ($4-5+6$), the common "BIDMAS error" is to believe Addition must happen before Subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S', leading to $5+6$ first. However, the data also shows many students default to reading left-to-right regardless of rules.
In **Problem Q** ($4+5 \times 6$), students who follow BIDMAS will choose $5 \times 6$, but "Below Basic" and "Basic" students often work strictly left-to-right ($4+5$).

The calibration data shows that even for "simple" looking questions (like $8+12 \div 4$), 84% chose the wrong comparison, likely because they did not apply BIDMAS to the first term. Option D ($5+6$ first and $5 \times 6$ first) is the classic "false BIDMAS" trap that mirrors the error seen in the mean question.

below_basic: A=10% B=5% C=35% D=50%
basic: A=12% B=15% C=23% D=50%
proficient: A=8% B=32% C=15% D=45%
advanced: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
