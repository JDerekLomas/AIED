To calibrate my marking, I've looked closely at the earlier results. This cohort struggles significantly with formal algebraic structure (e.g., 92% choosing a visually similar but incorrect algebraic fraction and 88% failing to recognize a standard two-step equation balance). However, they are reasonably competent at basic computation, such as expanding quadratics (65%) or simple fraction addition (88%).

In this question, $x=0$, so $2y = 10$.

*   **Option C (5)** is correct.
*   **Option D (2.5)** is a highly attractive distractor; many students incorrectly assume they should divide the target (10) by the coefficient of $x$ (4) regardless of the $x$-value, or simply perform $10 \div 4$. 
*   **Option B (3)** often comes from students confusing the coefficients (perhaps $4+2x=10$ or similar trial and error). 
*   **Option A (20)** stems from multiplying the coefficients (4 * 5 or 2 * 10).

Given that the cohort's "Basic" level students frequently fall for superficial patterns (as seen in the $8+12 \div 4$ question where 84% ignored BIDMAS), I expect a significant lean toward the most "mathematical-looking" distractors.
