Based on the calibration data provided, several key trends emerge for this cohort. First, these students struggle significantly with order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), often performing operations from left to right or neglecting exponent rules (as seen in the sphere volume and the $(m-5)(m-7)$ question). Second, there is a very high tendency to choose answers based on digit patterns while ignoring decimal point placement or signs (as seen in the $10x-6y=30$ and $2p-1$ questions).

In the new question ($y=3x^2$ where $x=0.3$):
- **Option B (0.27)** is the correct answer: $0.3^2 = 0.09$, and $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.
- **Option D (2.7)** is a very "attractive" error: Students do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ then $0.9^2 = 0.81$ (incorrect order) or simply misplace the decimal point during $3 \times 0.3^2$.
- **Option C (1.8)** represents multiplying $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then doubling (instead of squaring), or $(3 \times 0.3) \times 2$.
- **Option A (0.81)** represents squaring the result of $3x$: $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$, a classic BIDMAS error.

Given the calibration data shows 99% of students failing a basic directed number expansion and 88% failing a two-step equation, the majority of the cohort will likely fail to square $0.3$ correctly.
