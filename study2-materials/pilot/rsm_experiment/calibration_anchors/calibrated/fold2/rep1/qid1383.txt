Based on the calibration data provided, several key trends emerge:
1.  **Negative number sign errors:** The students struggle immensely with signs. In the bracket expansion question, 99% incorrectly chose $-5$ (D) instead of $+4$ (A) for $(-1) \times (-4)$, suggesting they almost universally apply the rule that adding/multiplying terms with negatives results in a negative, or they simply sum the digits and keep the sign.
2.  **Arithmetic over Substitution:** There is a high "attractive" error rate for multiplying the base by the index (e.g., $k \times 4$ instead of $k^4$). 
3.  **Low confidence in "Correct" Algebraic logic:** Much like the sphere or $3p=1/12$ questions, students gravitate toward the most visually simplistic or "obvious" combination of the numbers shown.

For $T = (-3)^4$:
- **A (81):** The correct answer. Requires knowing $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$. Given the 0% success on the simple $(-1) \times (-4)$ expansion, few will get the sign right.
- **B (12):** Based on $3 \times 4 = 12$. A very common error for students who confuse indices with multiplication.
- **C (-81):** The most attractive wrong answer for higher-ability students. They know $3^4 = 81$, but they assume a negative base always results in a negative power, or they use their calculator without brackets: $-3^4$.
- **D (-12):** Based on $(-3) \times 4 = -12$. This aligns with the error seen in the expansion question where $99\%$ chose $-5$.
