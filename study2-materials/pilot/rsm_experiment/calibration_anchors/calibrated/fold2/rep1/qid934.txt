To calibrate for these students, we must acknowledge the high prevalence of systematic "superficial" errors seen in the previous data. Specifically:
- **Calculation priority/Algebraic rules:** Students frequently ignore standard operations (e.g., the 92% choosing $c/h+4$ or the 84% choosing the inequality based on appearance rather than calculation).
- **Substitution/Solving:** There is a heavy "guess-and-check" or "incorrect rearrangement" culture (e.g., the $10=\frac{5}{p} \Rightarrow D$ or $15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \Rightarrow 61=k$).
- **The Zero Effect:** Students often struggle with $0$ in equations, either ignoring the term or applying the operation incorrectly.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
*   **A) 20:** Misinterpreting $4x+2y=10$ with $x=0$ as $2y=10 \times 2$ or perhaps adding $10$ and $2y \times 5$. Less likely than others.
*   **B) 3:** Likely "pattern" guess. If $x$ is 0 and the answer is 10, they might try to find a number that "fits" a linear sequence visually, or $10 - 4 - 2 - 1$.
*   **C) 5:** Correct calculation ($4(0) + 2y = 10 \Rightarrow 2y = 10 \Rightarrow y=5$).
*   **D) 2.5:** Most "attractive" error. Students see $x=0$ and assume they divide the constant $10$ by the $4$ from the $4x$ term, or confuse the roles of $x$ and $y$ (i.e., $10/4$).

Based on the performance where 88% missed the Tom/Katie linear equation and 85% fell for the sign error in the $10x - 6y = 30$ question:
