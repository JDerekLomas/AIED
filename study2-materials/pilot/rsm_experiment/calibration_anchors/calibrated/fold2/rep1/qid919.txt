To calibrate for this Year 9 cohort, we must look at the specific misconceptions evidenced in the previous data:
1. **Misconception 1: Over-application of basic operations.** On the Bidmas question, 84% chose $D$ because they saw $(8+12)\div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$, and instinctively felt $D (\geq)$ was a safe "maths-sounding" choice, or failed to process the first half of the inequality entirely.
2. **Misconception 2: Decimal/Mental Math struggles.** On the $2p-1$ question, 99% missed the basic multiplication $-1 \times -4$, opting for $-5$. This shows a massive tendency to *add* rather than *multiply* when faced with signs and decimals.
3. **Misconception 3: Squares and Order of Operations.** In the sphere volume question (61% choosing D), students demonstrated a lack of confidence with powers and coefficients.

**The Question: $y = 3x^2$ where $x=0.3$.**
- **Correct: B ($0.27$).** Calculation: $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$; $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$.
- **Distractor A ($0.81$):** Squaring $(3x)$. $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$. This is a very common algebraic error (incorrect order of operations).
- **Distractor C ($1.8$):** Doing $3 \times 0.3$ and then multiplying by $2$ instead of squaring.
- **Distractor D ($2.7$):** Misplacing the decimal in the correct calculation (getting $0.3^2 = 0.9$ instead of $0.09$).

Based on the cohort's previous 0-1% success rate on conceptually similar tasks (like the division algebraic convention or the linear table of values), this question is highly likely to see a "favourite" distractor dominate. Given the 99% failure on $-1 \times -4 = -5$, I expect students to gravitate toward Option D, thinking $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ (ignoring the place value) then $0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$.
