To predict these distributions, I have analysed the common pitfalls based on the previous questions where students struggled significantly with order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and directed numbers (e.g., the expansion and mean questions).

In the expression \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\):
- **Option A (6)** is correct: \(3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6\).
- **Option B (4)** assumes the student does addition before subtraction (a common misconception in the order of BIDMAS): \(3 - (5 + 8) = 3 - 13 = -10\), but B is more likely reached by students doing \((3 - 5) + 4 = 2\); \(2 \times 2 = 4\), essentially working left to right ignoring order of operations.
- **Option C (-12)**: This is the result of working purely left to right without signs: \(3 - 5 = -2\); \(-2 + 4 = 2\); then a calculation error, or more likely \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\), but treating the \(4 \times 2\) as its own unit and somehow subtracting.
- **Option D (-10)**: This is a highly "attractive" wrong answer for this cohort. Many students believe **Addition** comes before **Subtraction** because 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym. Therefore: \(5 + (4 \times 2) = 13\), then \(3 - 13 = -10\).

Based on the 84% failure rate on the \(8+12 \div 4\) question, we can expect very high error rates here.
