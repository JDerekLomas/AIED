To predict the performance of this Year 9 cohort, we must look at the trends established in the calibration data. Notably:
1. **Misapplication of Order of Operations (BIDMAS):** Students consistently believe addition must occur before subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S' (see the $0, 1, 3, 4, 7$ mean question and the $8+12 \div 4$ question).
2. **Preference for Addition over Subtraction/Division:** There is a heavy "recency" or "comfort" bias towards adding numbers rather than subtracting or multiplying if they are adjacent.
3. **Left-to-Right Neglect:** In Problem P ($4-5+6$), many students will force $(5+6)$ because they believe "Addition before Subtraction" is an absolute rule, or they ignore the negative sign attached to the $5$. 
4. **Incorrect Priority in BIDMAS:** Even in Problem Q ($4+5 \times 6$), lower-ability students tend to calculate from left to right regardless of the operator.

Based on the 88% and 92% failure rates on similar "logical order" questions in the calibration set, we can expect "D" to be a very attractive "distractor" for Problem P, and "A" or "C" to be attractive for those who ignore the multiplication priority in Problem Q.
