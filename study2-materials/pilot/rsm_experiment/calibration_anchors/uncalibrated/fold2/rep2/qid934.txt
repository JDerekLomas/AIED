In this Year 9 mock, students find the implicit form ($4x+2y=10$) significantly more difficult than the explicit form ($y=mx+c$). 

**Error Analysis:**
*   **A (20):** Common for students who think the star must be a "large" number, or erroneously multiply the constants together ($4 \times 5 = 20$) after getting confused by the variables.
*   **B (3):** This is the most common procedural error. Students correctly plug in $x=0$ to get $2y=10$, but then mistakenly subtract $2$ instead of dividing by it ($10 - 2 = 8$, or even more commonly, seeing the 4 and 2 and thinking $4+3=7$ etc). However, the strongest attractor for B is often a "pattern match" or a simple miscalculation of $10 \div 2$.
*   **C (5):** The correct answer. $4(0) + 2y = 10 \implies 2y = 10 \implies y = 5$.
*   **D (2.5):** This is a very common "partial knowledge" trap. Students divide $10$ by the $4$ instead of the $2$, or try to find the x-intercept instead of the y-intercept, or simply divide 10 by 4 because 4 is the first number they see in the equation.
