Having marked 200 of these Year 9 papers, the biggest "traps" are undoubtedly the negative base and the common misconception that exponents are simply multipliers.

**Error Analysis:**
*   **B (12) and D (-12):** These are the most common "Low Ability" errors. Students see a 4 and a 3 and multiply them together. If they are aware of the negative sign but lack confidence, they pick D. 
*   **C (-81):** This is the classic "Intermediate Trap." These students know $3^4 = 81$, but they mistakenly believe that because the base is negative, the result must also be negative. Many will type `-3^4` into a non-scientific calculator or a poorly-set-up phone calculator without brackets and get this result, leading them to trust it.
*   **A (81):** The correct answer. Students must know that an even power of a negative number results in a positive value.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on a standard UK Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
