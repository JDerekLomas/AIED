To predict these percentages, I have analysed the following common cognitive paths for Year 9 students:

*   **Option A ($0.81$):** A classic "over-squaring" error. Students compute $(3x)^2$ rather than $3(x^2)$, effectively doing $0.9 \times 0.9$.
*   **Option B ($0.27$):** The **correct** answer ($0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$, then $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$). 
*   **Option C ($1.8$):** A misconception about indices where students multiply the base by the power ($3 \times 0.3 \times 2$), or they correctly square $0.3$ to get $0.9$ (missing a decimal place) and then double it instead of tripling it.
*   **Option D ($2.7$):** The most common "high-ability" distractor. Students know the digits are $27$ but struggle with the placement of the decimal point when squaring $0.3$. They often think $0.3^2 = 0.9$, so $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=65% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=0% D=3%
