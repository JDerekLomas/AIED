Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on typical UK Year 9 performance and common misconceptions regarding BIDMAS (Order of Operations).

**Teacher's Mark Scheme Reflections:**
*   **The "L to R" Trap (Problem P):** Many students believe "A" comes before "S" in BIDMAS, so they feel they *must* add before they subtract ($5+6=11$, then $4-11$). In reality, addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be done left-to-right. Therefore, $4-5$ is the correct first step.
*   **The "Visual Drift" (Problem Q):** Students often read left-to-right regardless of operators, leading them to $4+5$ first. The multiplication sign is frequently ignored by lower-ability students.
*   **Distractor D:** This is the "BIDMAS Over-correction" where students correctly identify multiplication first for Q, but incorrectly apply a "must do Addition before Subtraction" rule for P.
