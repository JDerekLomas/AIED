In this Year 9 mock, students find linear equations in implicit form ($4x+2y=10$) significantly more challenging than the standard $y=mx+c$. After marking 200 papers, here is the breakdown:

**Diagnostic thought process:**
*   **A (20):** A common "number grabbing" error where students see the 4 and the 5 (from $10/2$) and multiply them, or attempt to do $4 \times 5 = 20$.
*   **B (3):** The "Substituted but didn't solve" or "Logic Jump" error. Many students see $x=0, y=?$ and try to make the coefficients or numbers look "pattern-like" or perform an incorrect mental calculation like $(10 - 4) \div 2$.
*   **C (5):** The "Half-way correct" answer. When $x=0$, the equation becomes $2y=10$, therefore $y=5$. This is the correct answer, but many lower-ability students miss the $2y$ and just look at the $4x$ and the $10$.
*   **D (2.5):** The "Division by the wrong coefficient" error. Students isolate $x$ instead of $y$ ($10/4 = 2.5$) or simply divide the 10 by 4 because it’s the first number they see in the equation.

**Predicted Results:**
