Based on marking hundreds of Year 9 papers, this question specifically targets the common misconception regarding negative bases and even exponents, as well as the confusion between powers and multiplication.

**Thinking Process:**
*   **Error B/D ($12/-12$):** These are the "Below Basic" distractors. Students here multiply the base by the index ($3 \times 4$). 
*   **Error C ($-81$):** This is the most common "attractive" error. Many "Proficient" students perform the calculation $3^4 = 81$ correctly but fail to apply the rule that an even power of a negative number is positive, or they are led astray by how they might incorrectly input it into a non-scientific calculator (i.e., $-3^4$ instead of $(-3)^4$).
*   **A (81):** This requires both the knowledge of indices ($3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$) and the sign rule (negative $\times$ negative $\times$ negative $\times$ negative = positive).

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=38% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=0% C=4% D=0%
