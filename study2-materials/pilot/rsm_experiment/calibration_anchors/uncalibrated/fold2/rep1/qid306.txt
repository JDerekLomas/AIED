Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on typical UK Year 9 performance and common misconceptions regarding order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

**The Logic of the Errors:**
*   **The 'AS' Trap (Problem P):** Many students believe "Addition comes before Subtraction" because A precedes S in the acronym. This leads them to prioritize $5+6$ (Option D), resulting in the incorrect $4-11=-7$ rather than the correct left-to-right approach $4-5+6=5$.
*   **The Linear Trap (Problem Q):** Students with low retention of priority rules simply work from left to right, adding $4+5$ first (Options A and C).
*   **The Proficient Pivot:** Proficient students correctly identify the multiplication priority in Problem Q but often still fall for the $5+6$ addition trap in Problem P because it is a very common "over-correction" of the BIDMAS rules.
