In marking these 200 papers, the most common pitfall is the "Left-to-Right Trap." Students often treat BIDMAS/BODMAS as a rigid queue rather than a hierarchy, but many Year 9s forget it entirely and simply process numbers as they appear.

**Distractor Analysis:**
*   **A (6):** The correct answer. Apply multiplication first: $3 - 5 + 8$. Then addition/subtraction left-to-right: $-2 + 8 = 6$.
*   **B (4):** A common error among those who remember "Addition before Subtraction" literally. They calculate $5 + 8 = 13$, then $3 - 13 = -10$, but often lose the sign or compute $13 - 9$ due to number line confusion, though B is less common than D for this error.
*   **C (-12):** The "Pure Left-to-Right" error. $3 - 5 = -2$. Then $-2 + 4 = 2$. Then $2 \times 2 = 4$... Wait, no, they often do $3 - 5 = -2$; then $-2 + 4 \times 2 \rightarrow -6 \times 2 = -12$. This happens when they group $(3-5+4)$ before multiplying.
*   **D (-10):** The "Literal BIDMAS" error. Students do $4 \times 2 = 8$, then they see the addition sign and do $5 + 8 = 13$, finally calculating $3 - 13 = -10$. This is a very "attractive" wrong answer for mid-ability students who have been taught the acronym but not the "Left-to-Right" rule for Addition/Subtraction.
