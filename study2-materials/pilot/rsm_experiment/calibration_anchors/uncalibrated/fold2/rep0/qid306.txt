Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on common misconceptions surrounding BIDMAS (Order of Operations) in a Year 9 cohort.

**Teacher's Marking Notes:**
*   **The 'P' Trap:** Problem P (\(4-5+6\)) is the primary differentiator. Students are taught "Addition before Subtraction" via the BIDMAS acronym, leading many to incorrectly believe \(5+6\) must be done first. Only more proficient students recall that addition and subtraction have equal priority and are solved left-to-right.
*   **The 'Q' Success:** Most students (Basic and above) recognise that multiplication takes precedence over addition.
*   **Distractor D:** This is the most "attractive" wrong answer because it applies a rigid, literal interpretation of the BIDMAS acronym (\textbf{A} comes before \textbf{S}) to Problem P while correctly applying it to Problem Q.
*   **Distractor A:** The "reading like a book" error, ignoring all order of operations.
