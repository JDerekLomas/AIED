In this Year 9 mock, students find linear equations in the form $ax + by = c$ significantly harder than the standard $y = mx + c$. The gold star specifically tests $x=0$, which is usually the easiest point, but the structure of this equation leads to several predictable errors based on common misconceptions about algebraic notation and operations.

**Reasoning behind the numbers:**
*   **Answer C (5) is the correct answer.** $4(0) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 10 \rightarrow y = 5$.
*   **Answer A (20)** is a classic "visual grouping" error. A struggling student sees $4$, $x$, and $y$, and the $0$. They might perform $(4+1) \times (0+4)$ or more commonly, mistakenly believe they multiply the entire right side by 2 once they "see" $y$ as having a coefficient.
*   **Answer B (3)** is the "sequential guess." Some students assume $y$ must decrease as $x$ increases in a pattern like $y = 5, 4, 3, 2, 1$. They often miscalculate $x=1$ or $x=2$ first, get a result like 3, and assume the table starts there.
*   **Answer D (2.5)** is a very common "attractive" wrong answer. Students often divide $10$ by $4$ because they see the $4$ first and are used to the coefficient of $x$ being the most important number in the equation.
