To predict these percentages, I have looked at three primary "traps" students fall into:
1.  **The "Add, don't multiply" error:** Students doing $3 \times 4$ or $3 + 3 + 3 + 3$ to get 12.
2.  **The "Sign of Power" error:** Realising it is $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$ but assuming the negative sign survives the exponentiation.
3.  **The "Calculator input" error:** Typing $-3^4$ into a scientific calculator without brackets, which yields $-81$.

**below_basic:** These students struggle with indices and often mistake $k^4$ for $k \times 4$. D is the most common answer here because it combines the multiplication error with the presence of a negative sign.
**basic:** These students know $3^4 = 81$, but they struggle with the rules of negative bases. Option C is the most frequent choice here; they see one negative sign and assume the answer must be negative.
**proficient:** These students generally know that an even power results in a positive answer. However, many fall into the trap of using a calculator incorrectly (not using brackets) or second-guessing the "double-negative" rule across four multiplications.
**advanced:** These students are secure in the knowledge that $(-3)^4 = (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$. They rarely make the multiplication error.

below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=25% B=5% C=55% D=15%
proficient: A=65% B=2% C=30% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=0% C=4% D=0%
