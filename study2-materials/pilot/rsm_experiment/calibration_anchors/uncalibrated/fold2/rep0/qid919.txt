To predict these percentages, I have analysed the common misconceptions associated with squaring decimals and the order of operations ($BIDMAS/BODMAS$):

*   **Option A ($0.81$):** This is the "Squared the product" error. Students calculate $(3 \times 0.3)^2$ or $0.9^2$. This is very attractive to students who ignore $BIDMAS$ and work left-to-right.
*   **Option B ($0.27$):** The correct answer. $0.3^2 = 0.09$, and $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$.
*   **Option C ($1.8$):** This is the "Double instead of Square" error. Students calculate $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$. 
*   **Option D ($2.7$):** This is the "Decimal Place" error. Students know $3^2 = 9$ and $9 \times 3 = 27$, but they place the decimal point incorrectly (treating $0.3^2$ as $0.9$ instead of $0.09$).

Here are the predicted percentages based on marking Year 9 mocks:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=20% B=60% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=92% C=0% D=3%
