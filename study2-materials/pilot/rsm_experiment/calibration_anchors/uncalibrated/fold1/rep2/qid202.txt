Having marked 200 of these scripts, this question highlights the common "adding the denominator" misconception and a tendency to overlook specific instructions about form.

**Calculation Errors & Traps:**
*   **The Trap (D):** This is the classic "add across" error. Lower-ability students often treat the numerator and denominator as separate sets of whole numbers, leading to $2+1=3$ (whole), $1+2=3$ (num), and $5+5=10$ (den). This feels incredibly natural to a student struggling with the concept of a fraction as a single value.
*   **The "Half-Finished" (B):** This is mathematically correct ($3 \frac{3}{5} = \frac{18}{5}$), but ignores the "Leave your answer as a mixed number" instruction. Students in the "basic/proficient" range who rely on converting everything to improper fractions first often forget to convert back.
*   **The Fundamental Flaw (C):** Combining the "add across" error with an improper fraction conversion (e.g., $11/5 + 7/5 = 18/10$).
*   **The Correct Path (A):** Proficient and Advanced students instinctively add the integers and parts separately and understand that the common denominator remains unchanged.

Here are the predicted percentages:

basic: A=45% B=20% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
