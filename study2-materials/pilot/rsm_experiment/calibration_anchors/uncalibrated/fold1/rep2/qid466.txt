In this Year 9 mock, students frequently stumble over the distinction between a multiplicative inverse (reciprocal) and an additive inverse. Many students correctly identify that 1 involves flipping the fraction, but they struggle to manage the negative sign, often feeling that "the negatives must cancel out" or simply ignoring signs altogether.

**Calculations & Errors:**
- **A ($\frac{4}{3}$):** The most "attractive" trap. Students remember they need the reciprocal to get '1' but assume they need a positive number to "offset" the negative, or they remember that a negative times a negative is positive, but get their target sign flipped in their head.
- **B ($-\frac{4}{3}$):** The correct answer. Students must recognise that $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1$.
- **C ($\frac{3}{4}$):** Chosen by students who think they just need to change the sign to make it positive, or confuse multiplication rules with addition rules ($-0.75 + 1.75 = 1$).
- **D ($-\frac{3}{4}$):** Chosen by students who believe multiplying a number by itself somehow results in 1, or who have no grasp of fractional multiplication.
