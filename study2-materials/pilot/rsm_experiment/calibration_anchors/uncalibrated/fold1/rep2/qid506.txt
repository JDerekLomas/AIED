After marking hundreds of these papers, here is the breakdown of how students typically approach this problem.

**The "Teacher's Eyes" Analysis:**
*   **The Trap (Option A):** This is the most common error. Students see $3$ and $12$ and immediately think $12 \div 3 = 4$, leading them to $\frac{1}{4}$. It’s a cognitive shortcut that bypasses the formal algebraic step of dividing both sides.
*   **The Conceptual Error (Option C):** Below-basic students often disregard the fraction entirely or perform a reciprocal multiplication incorrectly, essentially calculating $12 \div 3$ and ignoring the fact that 12 was a denominator.
*   **The Calculation Error (Option D):** This stems from a misunderstanding of the operation; some students mistakenly try to "square root" or relate it to $3 \times 3$, or they perform $12 - 3$. 
*   **The Correct Path (Option B):** To get $1/36$, the student must understand that dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying the denominator by 3 ($12 \times 3 = 36$).

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=55% B=30% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=75% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=2% B=98% C=0% D=0%
