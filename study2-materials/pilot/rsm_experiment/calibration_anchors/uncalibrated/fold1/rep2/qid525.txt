To arrive at these predictions, I’ve considered the following common Year 9 pitfalls:
*   **The "Add the Denominators" Trap (Option D):** This is the classic "low-ability" error. Students add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and then simply add the numerators ($7+1=8$) and the denominators ($10+4=14$). It feels "natural" because it mirrors multiplication rules.
*   **The Improper Fraction Conversion (Option A):** This attracts students who have been taught "always convert to improper fractions first." They calculate $\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$. However, many forget to read the instruction to leave it as a **mixed number**.
*   **The Common Denominator Error (Option C):** Students who know they need a common denominator but simply multiply the denominators without adjusting the numerators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) often end up with a mess or fail to simplify, sometimes reverting to improper fractions but with the wrong denominator logic.
*   **The Target (Option B):** This is the correct answer ($4 \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$). 

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown:
