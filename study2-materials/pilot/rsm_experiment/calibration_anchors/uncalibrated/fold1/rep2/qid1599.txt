To predict these percentages, I’ve considered the following common pitfalls:
*   **The Dividend/Divisor Flip (Option D):** Many students subconsciously put the "more complex" expression on the bottom or simply reverse the order because they are used to the larger value being the numerator.
*   **Order of Operations / Fractional Bar Misunderstanding (Option C):** Students often forget that the bracket implies the *entire* expression $(h+4)$ is the divisor. They treat division and addition as separate steps, often neglecting the binding nature of the vinculum.
*   **The Random "Matching" Error (Option B):** At lower ability levels, students often "balance" an expression by adding numbers to the numerator that appear in the denominator.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=55% B=5% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=0% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
