In this Year 9 mock, students find fractions combined with negative numbers to be a high-stakes "double trap." 

**Calculation Errors and Student Logic:**
*   **The Trap (A):** This is the most common error. Students know they need the "reciprocal" to get back to 1, and they know two minuses make a plus. However, they confuse the target $(-1)$ with the process of making $1$. They see the negative sign already in the question and assume the answer should be positive to "keep it simple."
*   **The Identity Error (C or D):** Lower-ability students often mistake multiplication for addition or simply get overwhelmed by the notation and pick the same fraction again, thinking of identities ($x \times 1 = x$).
*   **The "Double Negative" Logic:** Advanced students recognise that a negative times a positive is a negative ($-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1$). They are the most likely to correctly identify (A).
*   **Common Misconception (B):** Many mid-range students perform $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = 1$ and then reflexively put a minus sign on the answer because the question looks "negative," ending up with $+1$ instead of $-1$.
