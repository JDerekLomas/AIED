Having marked 200 of these scripts tonight, the "fraction fatigue" is definitely setting in for the Year 9s. This question is a classic "inverse operation" trap.

Here is my breakdown of the logic behind the errors:
*   **A ($p=1/4$):** This is the most "attractive" trap. Students see 3 and 12 and immediately think $12 \div 3 = 4$. Because the original problem has a fraction, they instinctively keep the answer as a fraction ($1/4$). They are performing the operation $1 \div (12 \div 3)$ rather than dividing $1/12$ by 3.
*   **B (The Correct Answer):** Requires the student to realise that dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying the denominator by 3 (or multiplying by $1/3$). 
*   **C ($p=4$):** Typical of students who ignore the numerator entirely or "cross-multiply" incorrectly, essentially solving $3p = 12$ or thinking $12/3 = 4$ and discarding the fraction.
*   **D ($p=1/9$):** A less common "halved/tripled" confusion where they might try to square the 3 or misread the 12 as a 9. It acts as a distractor for those who are guessing based on square numbers.

Here are my predicted percentages based on a typical UK Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=25% B=70% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=5% B=94% C=1% D=0%
