To predict these percentages, I’ve considered the following common Year 9 misconceptions:
*   **The "Fraction Bar" concept:** Lower-ability students often forget that a fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol (effectively replacing brackets).
*   **Reading direction:** A significant number of students still struggle with the order of division, often placing the "larger" looking term or the second term on top (Answer D).
*   **Linear to Vertical translation:** The most "attractive" distractor for middle-ability students is often Option C, as they process the calculation from left to right and fail to extend the fraction bar under the entire denominator.
*   **Copying errors:** Option B represents a classic "visual noise" error where the student over-associates the constant (+4) with both variables.

Here are the predicted percentages for 200 Year 9 mock papers:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
