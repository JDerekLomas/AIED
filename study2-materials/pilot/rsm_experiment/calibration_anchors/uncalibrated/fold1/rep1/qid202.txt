Having marked hundreds of these papers, here is the breakdown of how Year 9 students typically perform on this fractional addition question.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A (Correct):** The student adds the whole numbers (2+1=3) and the numerators (1+2=3), keeping the denominator the same.
*   **B (Misinterpreting instructions):** The student performs the calculation correctly but converts it to an improper fraction ($18/5$). Since the question asks for a mixed number, many students who "autopilot" their fraction work lose the mark here.
*   **C (Fundamental misconception):** Common among "below basic" students who treat fractions as four separate integers, adding across both the top and bottom ($1+2=3, 5+5=10$) and ignoring the whole numbers or multiplying them.
*   **D (Partial logic):** The student correctly adds the whole numbers but adds the denominators (a very "sticky" misconception for "basic" level students).

**Predicted Responses:**

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=50% B=10% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
