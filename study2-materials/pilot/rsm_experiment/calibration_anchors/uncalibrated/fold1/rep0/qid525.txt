To arrive at these predictions, I have considered the following common pitfalls:

*   **Option D (The "Top and Bottom" Error):** This is the most "attractive" distractor for lower-ability students. They simply add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), then add the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$). It feels intuitive but ignores the need for a common denominator.
*   **Option A (The "Incorrect Format" Error):** These students know the method—converting to improper fractions ($\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4}$) and finding a common denominator of 20 ($\frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$). However, they fail to follow the final instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
*   **Option C (The "Common Denominator by Multiplication" Error):** This often comes from students who try to find a common denominator by multiplying $10 \times 4$ to get $40$, but then make errors in adjusting the numerators or fail to simplify, and similarly forget the instruction for a mixed number.
*   **Option B (The Correct Answer):** This requires finding the lowest common multiple ($20$), converting correctly ($2 \frac{14}{20} + 2 \frac{5}{20}$), adding correctly, and following formatting instructions.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=20% D=55%
basic: A=20% B=35% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=25% B=60% C=10% D=5%
