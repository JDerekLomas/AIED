In marking this question, I would anticipate that the main hurdles for students are understanding that a division sign translates to a fraction bar acting as a grouping symbol, and the directional nature of division (numerator vs denominator).

**Common Errors observed:**
*   **Choice C (The Priority Error):** Many "basic" students forget that the parentheses $h+4$ must stay together. They see the division first and associate it only with the $h$, treating it like $c \div h + 4$.
*   **Choice D (The Reversal Error):** A classic mistake where students believe the larger or more complex expression "goes on top," or they simply get the dividend and divisor confused.
*   **Choice B (The "Fairness" Error):** A less common but recurring error among lower-ability students who feel that the $+4$ should be applied to both variables to keep the expression "balanced."

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown for Year 9:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=5% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=8% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
