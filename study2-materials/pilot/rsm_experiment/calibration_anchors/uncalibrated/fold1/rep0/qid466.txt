To solve \(-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1\), the correct answer is **A** (\(\frac{4}{3}\)), as the product of a negative and a positive is negative, and reciprocals multiply to 1.

**Teacher's Marking Notes:**
*   **The Sign Trap:** This is the primary distractor. Students know they need a reciprocal to get "1", but often forget that since the product is already negative, the missing value must be positive. Option B is highly "attractive" because students instinctively think "the signs must match" or "negative times negative is what we practiced last week."
*   **Reciprocal vs. Identity:** Below-basic students often see the target value (-1) and assume the fraction must remain similar (C or D), or they confuse multiplication rules with addition/subtraction rules (thinking they need to add something to get to -1).
*   **Advanced Logic:** High-ability students quickly identify that \(\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = 1\), and then check the signs. However, even they occasionally rush and pick B by reflex.
