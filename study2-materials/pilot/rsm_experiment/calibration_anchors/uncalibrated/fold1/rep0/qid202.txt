Having marked 200 of these scripts tonight, the most common pitfall is surprisingly not the fraction addition itself, but the failure to follow the instruction to "leave as a mixed number" (Option B) and the classic misconception of adding the denominators (Option D).

**Calculation Errors & Traps:**
*   **A (The Correct Answer):** Requires simple addition of the whole numbers and numerators. Most students find this intuitive.
*   **B (The "Did Not Read" Trap):** This is a mathematically correct improper fraction ($11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$). Advanced students who prefer working with improper fractions often default to this and forget to convert back, despite the instruction.
*   **C (The Multi-Error Trap):** Adding both the numerators and the denominators while ignoring the whole numbers ($1+2=3, 5+5=10$, but then forgetting the 2 and 1). This is common at the "Below Basic" level.
*   **D (The "Add Everything" Trap):** The student adds the whole numbers ($2+1=3$) and the numerators ($1+2=3$), but instinctively adds the denominators ($5+5=10$). This "feels" like a complete operation to a struggling student.

Here are my predicted percentages based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=35% B=10% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=65% B=15% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=4% C=0% D=0%
