After marking 200 of these, I can tell you this is a classic "separator" question. Many students see the 3 and the 12 and immediately think of the relationship $3 \times 4 = 12$, leading them to Options A and C without considering the algebraic structure.

Here is the breakdown of my predictions:

**Diagnostic Teacher Notes:**
*   **Option A ($1/4$):** The most common "fast" error. Students think "3 goes into 12 four times," and since the 12 is in a fraction, the answer must be $1/4$. They are essentially dividing 12 by 3 instead of dividing $1/12$ by 3.
*   **Option B (Correct):** Requires the student to multiply the denominator by 3 (or multiply by $1/3$).
*   **Option C (4):** Chosen by students who invert the relationship or perform $12 \div 3$ and ignore the fact that the 12 was a denominator.
*   **Option D ($1/9$):** A rarer error where students square the 3 or misremember the relationship between 3 and 12, sometimes confused with $3 \times 3 = 9$.
