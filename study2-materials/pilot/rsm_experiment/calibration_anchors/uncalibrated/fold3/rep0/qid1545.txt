Having marked hundreds of these, this is a classic "Order of Operations" trap. 

On the left-hand side ($8 + 12 \div 4$), students who don't apply BIDMAS/BODMAS will calculate $20 \div 4 = 5$. Those who follow the rules correctly will calculate $8 + 3 = 11$. 

On the right-hand side ($(8+12) \div 4$), the brackets force the $20 \div 4 = 5$ calculation regardless of the student's rule-following.

**The Logic behind the errors:**
*   **The Trap (Option C):** Students who work strictly left-to-right on the LHS arrive at $5 \square 5$. This is the most common error for Basic/Below Basic students who see numbers and just compute as they go.
*   **The Reversal (Option B):** Some students misremember the "greater than/less than" symbols, even if their arithmetic is correct.
*   **The Advanced Catch (Option A):** These students correctly identify $11 > 5$.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=10% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=97% B=1% C=2% D=0%
