In this question, students must navigate the multiplication of two negative constants, which is a classic Year 9 pitfall.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **B is the correct answer.**
*   **A ($m^2-2m-35$)**: This is the "addition error." Students see -5 and +7 (or misread one sign) and find the difference (-2) rather than the sum. Others incorrectly think $-5 \times -7 = -35$ because "it's still a minus."
*   **C ($m^2+12m+35$)**: This is the "lost sign" error. Students expand both to positive values ($+5$ and $+7$) then add them to get $+12$.
*   **D ($m^2-12m-35$)**: This is the most "attractive" trap. Students correctly add $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12m$, but their mental arithmetic for $-5 \times -7$ fails at the last second, leading them to think a "negative times a negative is a negative."
