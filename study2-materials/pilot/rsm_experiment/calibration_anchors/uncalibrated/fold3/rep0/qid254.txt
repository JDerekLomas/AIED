Having marked 200 of these scripts tonight, the "Zero Effect" is clearly the biggest hurdle here. Many Year 9s still struggle with whether zero "counts" as a value in a dataset, while others fall into the classic BODMAS/calculator input trap.

Here is the breakdown of my predictions:

**Diagnostic Teacher Notes:**
*   **A is the correct answer**, but students often think the zero can be ignored in the numerator, leading them to look for just $1+3+4+7$.
*   **B is the "Calculator Trap."** Without brackets, the order of operations means only the 7 is divided by 5. Basic/Lower-ability students who rely on scientific calculators without using the fraction button frequently make this error in practice.
*   **C is the "Counting Trap."** Students often ignore the 0 entirely, thinking that because it adds nothing to the sum, it shouldn't be counted in the divisor ($n=4$ instead of $n=5$).
*   **D is for the overthinkers** who might be looking for a version that explicitly shows $0 + \dots$ in the numerator.

below_basic: A=25% B=45% C=25% D=5%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=2% D=3%
