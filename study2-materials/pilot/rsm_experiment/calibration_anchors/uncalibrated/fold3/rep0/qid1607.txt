After marking 200 of these, I can tell you exactly where they trip up. This is a classic "rear-end" error. Students manage the difficult part (multiplication by 4) but then switch off during the simple addition/subtraction.

The mistake in Step 2 is the "intuitive movement" error: students see the $+1$ and, instead of performing the inverse operation $(-1)$, they "move it across" and combine it with the $60$ to make $61$. This feels right to a student who is working too fast or who hasn't mastered the concept of balance.

Here is the breakdown of how Year 9 typically performs on this:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=4% D=1%
