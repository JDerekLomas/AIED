In my experience marking this specific type of question, the challenge isn't just the arithmetic; it's the conceptual confusion between "multiplication" and "addition/subtraction" when terms are presented within brackets.

**Thinking Process:**
*   **The Trap (Options C & D):** Year 9 students often fall into the "additive trap." When they see $-1$ and $-4$, their brain jumps to $-1 - 4 = -5$ (Option D) or even just the digits added $1+4=5$ (Option C). This is highly attractive to those who forget that expanding brackets is a multiplicative process.
*   **The Sign Error (Option B):** This is the classic "middle-ability" error. Students know they must multiply $1 \times 4$, but they forget the "minus times a minus makes a plus" rule, or they simply carry over the sign of the larger digit.
*   **The Correct Logic (Option A):** This requires two successful steps: identifying that multiplication is required and applying negative number rules correctly.

**Predicted Distributions:**
