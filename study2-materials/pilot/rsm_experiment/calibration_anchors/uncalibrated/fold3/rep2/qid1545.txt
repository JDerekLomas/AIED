To arrive at these percentages, I've looked at the standard BIDMAS (Order of Operations) misconceptions common in Year 9.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **The Trap (Option C):** This is the "Visual Equality" trap. Students who lack fluency in order of operations see the same numbers and operators ($8, 12, 4, +, \div$) and instinctively assume they must be equal, ignoring the grouping effect of the brackets.
*   **Left-to-Right Error (LHS):** Many 'Below Basic' students will calculate the Left Hand Side as $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$, making both sides equal (Option C).
*   **The Correct Calculation (Option A):** LHS is $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$. RHS is $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$. Since $11 > 5$, A is correct.
*   **The 'Sophisticated' Error (Option B):** Some students misremember the rule and think that brackets always make a value *larger*, or they perform the division first on the left ($11$) but somehow get confused and think $5$ is greater than $11$ through a basic number line slip.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=65% D=5%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=48% D=2%
proficient: A=82% B=5% C=12% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
