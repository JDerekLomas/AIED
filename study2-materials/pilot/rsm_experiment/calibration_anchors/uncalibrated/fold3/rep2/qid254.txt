Having marked 200 of these scripts tonight, the "zero" is always the great divider in Year 9 data handling. Here is my breakdown based on common classroom misconceptions:

*   **Option A** is the correct mathematical process ($15/5 = 3$). Even though the zero doesn't change the sum, it is a data point that must be counted in the divisor.
*   **Option B** is the "calculator error." Students write it exactly as they would type it into a basic calculator without using brackets or the fraction button, effectively calculating $15 \div 5$ but representing it notationally as $0+1+3+4+1.4$.
*   **Option C** is the most common mistake for middle-to-lower ability students who believe that a value of zero "doesn't count" and should be ignored entirely.
*   **Option D** attracts high-ability students who overthink. They look for the zero in the numerator and, when they don't see it explicitly written, assume the expression is "technically" incorrect.

**Analysis of Results:**

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=35% D=5%
(These students often default to Option B because it looks like a standard horizontal sum, or Option C because they've been told "zero is nothing.")

basic: A=35% B=20% C=40% D=5%
(The "zero doesn't count" misconception is strongest here. They know how to find a mean but aren't sure if 0 is a "number.")

proficient: A=70% B=5% C=15% D=10%
(Most catch the zero issue, but a few get tripped up by the "cleanliness" of dividing by 4.)

advanced: A=92% B=0% C=3% D=5%
(Almost all will spot that adding 0 is identity, though a few will argue that Option A is "incomplete" because the 0 isn't shown in the sum.)
