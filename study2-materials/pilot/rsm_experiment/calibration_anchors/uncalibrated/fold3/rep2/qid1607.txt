In this question, the common pitfall is the transition from Step 1 to Step 2. While Isaac correctly multiplies by 4 in Step 1, he then adds 1 to 60 rather than subtracting it in Step 2. 

Lower-ability students often struggle to isolate the variable, frequently performing the same operation on both sides rather than the inverse (e.g., seeing $1 + k$ and thinking they must add 1). Proficient students will spot the multiplication is correct but will likely be "baited" into seeing "61" and thinking the whole process looks "maths-y" enough to be right. Advanced students will instantly recognise the sign error in the final step.
