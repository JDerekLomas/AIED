In this question, students must navigate two primary hurdles: the sum of the middle terms ($-5m - 7m = -12m$) and the product of the constants ($-5 \times -7 = +35$).

**Error Analysis:**
*   **Option B (Correct):** Students correctly sum $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$ and multiply them to get $+35$.
*   **Option A (The Difference Error):** This is common among lower-ability students who look for the "difference" between 5 and 7 instead of the sum, or who simply add the 7 and subtract 5. It is a very attractive "gut instinct" answer for those struggling with directed numbers.
*   **Option D (The Multiplier Sign Error):** This is the most common error for middle-ability students. They successfully get the $-12m$, but their brains follow the "minus/minus" pattern from the question and incorrectly conclude that the final term must also be negative, forgetting that a negative multiplied by a negative is a positive.
*   **Option C (The Positive Sum Error):** Less common, but usually occurs when a student thinks that "two minuses make a plus" applies to the addition/middle term as well.
