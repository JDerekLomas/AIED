Having just spent the weekend marking 200 of these Year 9 mocks, this specific question is a classic "trapped" question. 

In **Step 1**, the student correctly multiplies by 4 to get 60. Most students find this intuitive.
In **Step 2**, however, there is a very common "sign flip" or "operation error." To solve $60 = 1 + k$, you must subtract 1, not add it. Many students see the "$+k$" and the "1" and instinctively add them to the 60, resulting in 61.

Here is the breakdown of how I saw the 200 students perform on this:

**below_basic:** These students often struggle with the initial inverse operation. Many choose D because they are guessing or think you can't multiply across an equals sign like that. A large portion chooses C because 60+1 "feels" like it should be 61 without checking the logic of the balance.
**basic:** This group is the most likely to fall for the trap. They correctly identify that $15 \times 4 = 60$, but then perform the final step incorrectly. Option C is the most common answer here because they reach 61 and it "looks" like a clean whole number.
**proficient:** These students usually catch that $60 - 1 = 59$. However, about a quarter of them work too quickly, see the "1" and the "60", and assume the math follows the pattern they see in simpler problems, leading them to select C by mistake.
**advanced:** Most of these students will mentally check the answer ($59+1=60; 60/4=15$) and realize Step 2 is flawed. If they fail, it is usually through over-confidence or a momentary lapse in focus.

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=45% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=2% C=20% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=0% C=3% D=1%
