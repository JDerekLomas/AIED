To predict the outcome for this Year 9 cohort, we must look at the specific misconceptions surrounding negative numbers and the "FOIL" or "Grid" method of expansion.

**Common Errors Identified:**
*   **A (+4):** This is the correct answer. The student identifies that $(-1) \times (-4) = +4$. 
*   **B (-4):** The most common mistake. Students understand they need to multiply $1 \times 4$, but they either apply "a minus and a minus make a minus" (a common rule-confusion) or they simply carry the sign from the bracket without processing the multiplication of two negatives.
*   **C (+5):** A "distractor" for those who add instead of multiplying (1 + 4), and then apply the rule that two negatives make a positive.
*   **D (-5):** Very common among lower-ability students. They see $-1$ and $-4$ and instinctively combine them as if they are simplifying an expression ($ -1 - 4 = -5 $) rather than multiplying.

**Student Profile Predictions:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often conflate the operations. Addition of negatives is their default "combination" method.
*   **Basic:** They know to multiply, but their grasp of directed numbers is shaky. Option B is highly attractive as it "looks" more like the numbers in the brackets.
*   **Proficient:** Generally solid, but prone to "B" under time pressure if they are rushing through the "Last" part of FOIL.
*   **Advanced:** Should find this trivial, but 5% will still make a "B" slip through pure oversight.
