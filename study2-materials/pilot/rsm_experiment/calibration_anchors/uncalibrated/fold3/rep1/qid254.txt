Having marked hundreds of these papers, here is the breakdown based on common misconceptions regarding the treatment of zero in averages and the understanding of BIDMAS/order of operations.

**Teacher's Reflection on the Distractors:**
*   **Option A (The Trap):** This is the most "attractive" wrong answer. Students often think zero "doesn't count" in the sum, and while they know there are five numbers, seeing the sum look cleaner without the 0 makes this very popular for mid-to-low ability students.
*   **Option B (The Calculator Error):** Students who use a scientific calculator without using the fraction button or brackets frequently get this wrong. They understand the "sum ÷ count" rule but don't realise this calculation only divides the 7 by 5.
*   **Option C (The Conceptual Error):** Students here ignore the zero entirely—both in the sum and the count. They believe the mean is only for "value-bearing" numbers.
*   **Option D (The Correct Answer):** Requires the student to realise that the 0 *must* be included in the sum (even if it doesn't change the total) to maintain the logic of the calculation, or they notice that Option A is mathematically identical but Option B is written incorrectly due to order of operations.
