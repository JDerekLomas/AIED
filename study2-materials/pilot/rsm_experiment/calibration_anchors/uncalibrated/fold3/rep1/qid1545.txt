In this Year 9 mock, this question is a classic test of **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)**. Having marked 200 of these, the data usually shows a clear split between those who know to divide first and those who simply read from left to right.

**Calculations & Errors:**
*   **Correct (Left):** $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$
*   **Correct (Right):** $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$
*   **The Trap (Left):** $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 5$ (Reading left-to-right, ignoring BIDMAS). 
    *   *Resulting Error:* Students who make this mistake see $5 \square 5$ and choose **C (=)**. This is the most common "attractive" error.
    *   *Calculation:* If a student calculates $11 > 5$, they choose **A**.

**Ability Level Analysis:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many struggle with the concept of priority. They read the maths like a sentence (left-to-right), calculate $5 \square 5$ and pick $C$. Some guess $D$ simply because the symbol looks "more complex."
*   **Basic:** They recognise brackets but often forget division takes precedence over addition on the left side. The lure of $8+12$ being an easy $20$ is high. 
*   **Proficient:** These students usually remember "Division before Addition" but may make a hurried arithmetic error or briefly second-guess if the brackets on the right change the rules for the left.
*   **Advanced:** These students spot the BIDMAS trap instantly. They will correctly identify $11 > 5$ and rarely fall for the visual symmetry that tempts others into picking $C$.

here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
