In this context, I am looking at Year 9 students who frequently struggle with directed numbers. The core challenge in this question isn't the FOIL/Grid method itself, but the manipulation of negative signs when adding $(-5) + (-7)$ and multiplying $(-5) \times (-7)$.

**Diagnostic Analysis:**
*   **Option B (Correct):** Requires knowing that two negatives multiply to a positive and add to a larger negative.
*   **Option A (Error: Addition):** Students do $7-5=2$ instead of $-5-7$. This is very common for "Below Basic" students who simplify signs mentally to make the numbers "work."
*   **Option C (Error: All Positive):** The student sees two minus signs and recalls "two negatives make a plus," incorrectly applying this to both the middle and end terms.
*   **Option D (Error: Multiplication):** The student adds correctly for the middle term $(-12m)$ but calculates $(-5) \times (-7) = -35$, a classic sign error at the final step.

**Predicted Distributions:**

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=3% D=12%
advanced: A=1% B=97% C=0% D=2%
