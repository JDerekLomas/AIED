Having marked 200 of these, this specific question is a notorious "gradient killer." The main hurdle here is not the algebra itself, but a cognitive shortcut: students see a 10 and a 5 and instinctively want the answer to be 2 or 50. The most common error is "calculation by intuition" rather than formal rearrangement.

**Mental traps identified:**
*   **The "Large/Small" Trap (Option C):** Many students assume they must divide the larger number by the smaller one ($10 \div 5 = 2$). This is the most common error for Basic and Below Basic students.
*   **The "Multiplication" Trap (Option B):** Students see the fraction as a division and "undo" it by multiplying the two visible integers ($10 \times 5 = 50$).
*   **The Reciprocal Awareness (Option A):** This requires the student to move $p$ to the top or recognise that $10p = 5$, therefore $p = 5/10$. Only students with solid fractional awareness catch this.
*   **The "No Solution" (Option D):** Occasionally chosen by students who believe a smaller number divided by something cannot result in a larger number.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=35% C=50% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=10% C=23% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
