To determine the correct answer, we substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option C (Correct):** Students follow the algebraic steps correctly.
*   **Option D (The "Minus" Trap):** Students correctly calculate $6 \times 0.5 = 3$, but instead of adding 3 to 30, they subtract it ($10x = 27 \Rightarrow x = 2.7$). This is a very common sign-error trap for "Basic" tier students.
*   **Option A (The "Switch" Trap):** Students mistake which variable is given. They plug $0.5$ into $x$: $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y \approx -4.16$. They often ignore the negative or rounding, leading to a "near miss" guess of 4.25 or -4.25.
*   **Option B:** Same as above, but keeping the negative sign.
