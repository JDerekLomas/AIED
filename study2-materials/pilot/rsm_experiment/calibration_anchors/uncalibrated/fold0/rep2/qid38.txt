To simplify $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator (usually $2x$). This requires multiplying the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$, giving $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

**Teacher's Analysis of Distractors:**
*   **A (Correct):** Found the common denominator correctly.
*   **B (The "Add everything" trap):** Adding numerators $(3+4=7)$ and adding denominators $(2x+x=3x)$. This is the most common error for students who haven't mastered fractions.
*   **C (The "Double it wrong" trap):** Correctly doubled the numerator to get $8$, but then erroneously thought the denominator was now just $x$, or added $3+8$ and ignored the $2$.
*   **D (The "Forgot to multiply" trap):** Correctly identified $2x$ as the common denominator but forgot to multiply the numerator of the second fraction, simply adding $3+4$.
