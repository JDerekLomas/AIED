To predict these percentages, I've considered the common "order of operations" confusion when rearranging equations. 

**Tom's method** (Adding 5 to both sides first) is the standard approach taught in UK classrooms ("isolate the x-term first"). This feels safe and intuitive to most. 

**Katie's method** (Multiplying by 3 first) is mathematically valid but a classic "trap" area. Students often forget that *every* term must be multiplied by 3. Those who select 'Both' usually fail to see that Katie forgot to multiply the -5, making it a very "attractive" wrong answer for mid-range students who understand the concept of inverse operations but lack rigor.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=28% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%
