In this Year 9 mock, students find the rearrangement of the sphere formula particularly challenging because it involves three distinct steps: multiplying by 3, dividing by $4\pi$, and cube rooting.

**The "Attractor" Errors:**
*   **Option A:** This is the most common error for students who know the formula but struggle with "fractional" algebra. They see the $4/3$ and mistakenly multiply the volume by the $4$ as well, or they get confused about which terms belong in the numerator.
*   **Option B:** This represents a "halfway" logic. Students correctly move the $4$ and the $\pi$ down but forget that they must multiply by the $3$ (the inverse of dividing by $3$).
*   **Option D:** This is typical of students who attempt to "square root" or "cube root" parts of the formula individually before moving them, or who simply lose track of the fraction bars during the rearrangement process.
*   **The Trap:** Many "Proficient" students choose C correctly but a significant chunk will flip the $3/4$ because they try to do the rearrangement in a single mental step.

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 Year 9 scripts:

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=93% D=2%
