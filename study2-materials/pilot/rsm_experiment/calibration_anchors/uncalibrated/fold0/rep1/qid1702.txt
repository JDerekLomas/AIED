To predict the performance of 200 Year 9 students on this question, we must look at the specific common misconceptions:

*   **Option C (3.3):** This is the "high-frequency trap." Students substitute $0.5$ for $y$, getting $10x - 3 = 30$. They then add $3$ to get $10x = 33$, resulting in $3.3$. This feels correct because the arithmetic is "clean."
*   **Option D (2.7):** This is a very common sign error. Students substitute $0.5$ for $y$, get $10x - 3 = 30$, but then **subtract** 3 from 30 (thinking the $-3$ moves across the equals sign but failing to inverse the operation). $10x = 27$ leads to $2.7$.
*   **Option A (4.25) and B (-4.25):** These occur when students substitute $0.5$ for **$x$** instead of **$y$**. $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30 \rightarrow -6y = 25 \rightarrow y = -4.16...$ (or roughly 4.25 if they make a division error or swap $x$ and $y$ and forget the negative). Lower-ability students often default to substituting into the first variable they see ($x$).
