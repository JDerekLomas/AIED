In this equation, Tom is correct because he applies the inverse operation of $+5$ to both sides correctly. Katie is incorrect because she only multiplies the 12 by 3, forgetting to multiply the $-5$ by 3 (a classic distributive property error).

Below-basic students often guess or think that any operation "sounds right" as long as numbers change. Basic students recognize inverse operations but often fall for Katie's trap because multiplying the denominator seems like the most urgent "first step," and they frequently forget to multiply the isolated constant. Proficient students usually recognise Tom's step as the standard "correct" way to teach it but may still be lured into thinking Katie's alternative is valid. Advanced students spot that Katie failed to multiply the $-5$.

**Calculations leading to wrong answers:**
*   **B/C (Katie's error):** This is the most common mistake. Students see "divide by 3" and think "multiply by 3," but they only apply it to the $x$ and the $12$, failing to treat the $-5$ as part of the side being multiplied.
*   **D:** Often chosen by students who believe the 12 should have become 7 or who think $x$ must be solved immediately in one line.
