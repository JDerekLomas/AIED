In this particular Year 9 mock question, the variable $p$ being in the denominator is the primary hurdle. 

*   **Error for B ($p=50$):** This is the most "attractive" trap for lower-ability students. They see 10 and 5 and instinctively multiply them, failing to recognize that $p$ is a divisor.
*   **Error for C ($p=2$):** This is a very common "visual" error. Students see 10 and 5 and perform $10 \div 5$, effectively solving $10 = 5p$ instead of $10 = 5/p$.
*   **Error for D (No solutions):** Chosen by students who feel "stuck" when a larger number is equal to a fraction with a smaller numerator, mistakenly believing the result must be less than 1 but not knowing how to get there.
*   **The "A" Trap:** High-ability students identify that $10p = 5$, leading to $p = 5/10$. Proficient students sometimes stumble here and do $10/5$ out of habit, while Advanced students quickly simplify $5/10$ to $0.5$.

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 Year 9 mock papers:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
