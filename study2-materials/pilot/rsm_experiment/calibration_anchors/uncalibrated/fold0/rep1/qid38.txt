To solve this problem, a student must find a common denominator (likely $2x$) and then adjust the numerator of the second fraction.

**Error Analysis:**
*   **A ($11/2x$):** The correct answer. Student converts $4/x$ to $8/2x$ and adds $(3+8)/2x$.
*   **B ($7/3x$):** The "add everything" trap. The student adds the numerators ($3+4=7$) and adds the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). Extremely common for those with a poor grasp of fraction rules.
*   **C ($11/x$):** Misidentifying the common denominator. The student remembers to double the $4$ to get $8$, but thinks they can just "drop" the $2$ from the denominator or that $2x + x$ somehow stays as $x$.
*   **D ($7/2x$):** The "common denominator found but numerators ignored" error. The student identifies $2x$ as the base but simply adds the existing numerators $3+4$ without adjusting them.
