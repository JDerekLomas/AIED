In this Year 9 mock, students find rearanging formulae involving fractions particularly difficult. The most common pitfall is the algebraic "flip" when moving the $\frac{4}{3}$ across the equals sign.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A is the "multiplication trap":** Students know $4$, $3$, $\pi$, and $V$ are involved, but they multiply by the numerator ($4$) rather than dividing by it.
*   **B is the "incomplete inverse":** Students correctly move the $\pi$ down, but fail to reciprocate the fraction correctly, often just "tacking it on."
*   **C is the correct answer:** Requires multiplying by $3$, then dividing by $4\pi$, then cube rooting.
*   **D is the "order of operations" error:** Students take the cube root of $V$ first but then treat the remaining constants as coefficients to be moved at the end, often resulting in messy linear notation.

Here is the predicted distribution based on marking 200 papers:

basic: A=25% B=35% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=65% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=93% D=2%
