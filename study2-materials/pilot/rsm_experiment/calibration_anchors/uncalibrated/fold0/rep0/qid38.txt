To solve $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, students must find a common denominator (usually $2x$). This involves doubling the numerator of the second fraction: $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

**Teacher's Analysis of Distractors:**
*   **A (Correct):** The student correctly identifies the common denominator as $2x$, doubles the $4$ to get $8$, and adds $3+8$.
*   **B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** The classic "add across" error. $3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$. This is highly attractive to lower-ability students who treat algebraic fractions like integers.
*   **C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** The student knows to double the 4 to get 8 and adds them to get 11, but fundamentally misunderstands the denominator or "cancels" the 2 incorrectly.
*   **D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** The student recognizes $2x$ as the common denominator but forgets to scale the numerator of the second fraction, simply adding $3+4$. This is a very common "mid-ability" slip.
