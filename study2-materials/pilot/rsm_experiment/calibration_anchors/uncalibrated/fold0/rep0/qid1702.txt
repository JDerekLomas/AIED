To determine the correct answer, one must substitute $y = 0.5$ into $10x - 6y = 30$.
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \implies 10x - 3 = 30 \implies 10x = 33 \implies x = 3.3$.

**Calculation Errors and Traps:**
*   **Choice C (Correct):** Students substitute $0.5$ correctly, manage the negative sign, and divide by 10.
*   **Choice D (The Sign Error):** The most common mistake. Students treat the equation as $10x + 6y = 30$ or incorrectly add/subtract. $10x + 3 = 30 \implies 10x = 27 \implies x = 2.7$. This "feels" right to students who struggle with rearranging negative terms.
*   **Choice A (Substitution Flip):** Students put $0.5$ in for $x$ instead of $y$. $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \implies 5 - 6y = 30 \implies -6y = 25 \implies y = -4.16$ (roughly), or they miscalculate $10 \times 0.5$ and try to work back to a "cleaner" number provided in the options. Some perform $30 \div 6 = 5$, then $5 + 0.5$.
*   **Choice B:** Usually a guess or a result of complex sign errors involving the $-6y$ term becoming positive and then moving over.

**Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often pick D because 2.7 looks like it belongs in a sequence with 30, or A via a random arithmetic guess.
*   **Basic:** Heavily prone to the sign error (Choice D). They know to substitute, but the $-3$ becoming $+3$ when moving across the equals sign is a 50/50 chance for them.
*   **Proficient:** Usually identify Choice C, but a significant minority will still rush and pick D.
*   **Advanced:** Almost always get C, though a small percentage may slip up on a mental calculation if they don't write it down.
