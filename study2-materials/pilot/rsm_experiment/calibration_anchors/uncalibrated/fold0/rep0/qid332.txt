To predict these percentages, I’ve considered the most common pitfalls in Year 9 linear equations:

*   **Tom's logic (+5 to both sides):** This is the standard first step taught in UK schools ("BIDMAS in reverse"). Most students recognise this as correct.
*   **Katie's logic (multiplying by 3):** This is the "classic" trap. Lower-ability students forget to multiply the -5 by 3, thinking they can just "remove" the fraction from the $x$ term. They see $12 \times 3 = 36$ and assume she is correct. 
*   **The Trap (Option C):** This is highly attractive to middle-attainment (Basic/Proficient) students who understand the inverse operations but haven't mastered the distributive property of multiplication over an entire side of an equation.
*   **Advanced Students:** They recognise that for Katie to be correct, the equation would have needed to be $\frac{x-5}{3} = 12$. They are the only group that overwhelmingly picks A.

basic: A=35% B=10% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=38% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=6% D=0%
