Having just sat at my kitchen table marking 200 of these, I can tell you that this question is a classic "trap" for Year 9s.

The most common error is "number matching" where students see a 10 and a 5 and immediately perform the calculation $10 \div 5 = 2$. It feels natural because it results in a whole number. Option B ($10 \times 5 = 50$) is the mistake made by those who remember they need to "multiply to move the fraction" but multiply the wrong side. Option A requires the student to correctly rearrange to $10p = 5$ or $p = 5/10$, which many basic and proficient students intuitively resist because they expect to divide the larger number by the smaller one.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=45% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=30% D=0%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%
