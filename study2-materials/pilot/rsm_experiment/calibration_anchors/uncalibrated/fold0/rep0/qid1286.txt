In this Year 9 mock, this question assesses "changing the subject of a formula" involving a cube root, compounded by the students' memory of the sphere volume formula.

**Analysis of the Traps:**
*   **The "Upside Down" Trap (B):** This is the most attractive distractor. Students recall the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$, but when rearranging $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, they struggle with the reciprocal. They simply "move" the 4/3 to the other side without flipping it.
*   **The Multiplier Error (A):** These students incorrectly multiply both sides by $4/3$ or mistake the relationship between the numerator and denominator in the original formula.
*   **The Index Error (D):** Common among lower-ability students who apply the cube root only to the $V$ rather than the entire expression, or fail to understand how the root behaves over a fraction.
*   **The Proficiency Gap:** Proficient students usually remember $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ and can perform the first step ($3V = 4\pi r^3$), but many falter at the final division.
