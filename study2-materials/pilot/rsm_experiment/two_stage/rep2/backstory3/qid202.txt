Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B**, despite Option A being the mathematically identical and technically "correct" answer based on the prompt's instruction.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s primary hurdle here isn't the arithmetic; it's his temperament. Because he finds standard classroom theory "soul-crushing," he often bypasses the "standard" method (adding whole numbers then fractions) in favour of a more mechanical, visualisable process. He is likely to convert these into improper fractions immediately (\(11/5 + 7/5\)) because it feels more like "building" a calculation.

While he will easily reach \(18/5\), his tendency to lose focus during "repetitive" or "dry" tasks means he will likely spot his calculated value in the options and select it immediately, neglecting the final instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number." His obsessive need to over-visualise the problem might even lead him to draw three circles and various segments in the margin to "see" the 18 fifths, making him feel so certain of the improper fraction that he ignores the formatting requirement of the question.

**Predicted Percentages:**
For "Proficient" students like Leo—those who have the underlying skill but struggle with exam technique, lose focus on simple instructions, or over-complicate the method—the distribution is often split between the correct value (A) and the unformatted version (B).

proficient: A=45% B=40% C=5% D=10%
