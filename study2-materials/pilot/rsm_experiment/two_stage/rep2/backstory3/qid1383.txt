Given Leo's profile, I predict he will choose **Option C: -81**.

**Reasoning:** 
Leo is intellectually sharp and has no trouble calculating $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$. However, because he finds "dry" substitution tasks tedious and his focus tends to waver during algebraic drills, he is highly susceptible to the classic negative-sign trap. 

While he loves 3D geometry and animation, this question lacks the visual or "puzzle" element that keeps him engaged. His tendency to over-complicate might lead him to think about the "negative" as a separate entity from the power. Furthermore, because he hates skipping problems, if he rushes to get back to his creative work or hits a momentary mental wall, he will likely perform a superficial substitution ($T = -3^4$) without drawing brackets. His visual-spatial mind might see the "minus" as a static object and the exponent acting only on the "3," leading him directly to -81. He is less likely to choose B or D, as his basic arithmetic (multiplication) is generally proficient.

**Percentage Predictions:**
For "Proficient" students who share Leo’s profile (strong visual-spatial skills but prone to "careless" algebraic errors and low engagement with rote theory):

below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=25% D=35%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=45% B=5% C=48% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%
