Leo is highly likely to choose **A) Only Tom**.

**Why Leo would choose this:**
Leo’s "over-visualisation" trap is his primary hurdle here. He will likely view the equation as a physical balance scale. When he sees Tom’s step (adding 5 to both sides), it clicks visually—he can imagine moving the weight to the other side of the balance to isolate the fraction. However, when he looks at Katie’s suggestion, his instinct for geometric logic will fail him. Because he struggles with "dry" algebraic rules, he is likely to forget the distributive property (that the 3 must multiply the -5 as well as the 12). He will likely see $x-5=36$ as a simple, elegant move, but his perfectionist nature will lead him to "verify" it by drawing it out. In doing so, he will realise it doesn't "fit" his mental model of the equation's structure, causing him to dismiss Katie and stick with Tom’s more linear, "safe" step. His tendency to lose focus during repetitive drills means he likely hasn't internalised the shortcut of multiplying the whole equation by the denominator.

**Percentage Predictions:**
Students at the "Proficient" level often understand the standard inverse operations (Tom) but frequently fall for the "partial multiplication" trap (Katie), where they multiply the fraction and the result but forget the isolated constant.
