Leo is highly likely to choose **A**.

**Reasoning:** 
Because Leo approaches maths visually, he will treat these fractions like components in one of his models that need to "fit" together. He will instantly recognise that the denominators aren't aligned and will likely draw a quick sketch of two rods or blocks to visualize the scale. He'll identify that $\frac{4}{x}$ is equivalent to $\frac{8}{2x}$ to find a common denominator. However, because he finds "dry" algebraic manipulation tedious and his focus often wavers during the final arithmetic step, there is a high risk he might accidentally add the denominators ($2x + x$) if he over-thinks the "merging" of his visual diagram, leading him to B. However, his proficiency level suggests he will correctly calculate $3 + 8 = 11$ over the common denominator of $2x$. He is less likely to choose D (simply adding the numerators) as that would feel "off-balance" to his geometric intuition.
