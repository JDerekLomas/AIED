Hello Leo. Put the sketchbook down for just a second—I know you're probably trying to figure out the focal length for that next frame, but let's look at this "puzzle" on the board.

**Predicted Choice: B**

**Why:** Leo is highly proficient but suffers from "wandering focus" during arithmetic tasks he deems "dry." While he knows BIDMAS/order of operations perfectly well, he tends to process strings of numbers horizontally as if they are a sequence of movements. Because he finds this question unstimulating, he is likely to rush the "simple" arithmetic to get back to his drawings. He will often calculate from left to right: $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, and finally $2 \times 2 = 4$. He over-complicates 3D space but under-thinks 1D arithmetic because his brain is already three steps ahead, imagining how that $+4$ looks as a vector translation rather than a term in a hierarchy.
