Leo is highly likely to choose **Option A ( > )**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s sharp geometric and spatial mind will immediately "see" the structure of this problem rather than just calculating it. He will look at the left-hand side and notice that only the 12 is being divided, whereas on the right-hand side, the entire sum is being divided. Even though he hates "dry" drills, his proficiency level means he knows BIDMAS/Order of Operations well. 

However, because he "over-complicates" and "visualizes from every angle," there is a danger he might spend three minutes drawing a scale model of the division in his margins to "prove" the weight of the numbers. He will correctly identify that $8 + 3 = 11$ (left) and $20 \div 4 = 5$ (right). The primary risk for a student like Leo is a "wavering focus" leading to a silly mental arithmetic error during the expansion of the right-hand bracket, but his inherent strength in 3D logic usually keeps him on the right track for inequality comparisons.

**Predicted Percentage of Similar "Proficient" Students:**
For students at this level, the most common error is failing to apply BIDMAS to the left-hand side (doing $8+12$ first), which leads them to Option C.

proficient: A=72% B=8% C=18% D=2%
