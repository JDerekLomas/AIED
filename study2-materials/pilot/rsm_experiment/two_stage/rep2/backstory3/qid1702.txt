Leo is highly likely to choose **C (3.3)**.

**Reasoning:** 
Leo will immediately try to "see" this on a coordinate grid rather than just moving symbols around. He’ll substitute $y = 0.5$ correctly: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$. At this stage, his tendency to "over-visualise" and his "wavering focus" during basic algebra will likely trip him up. Instead of the simple $10x = 33 \rightarrow x = 3.3$, he may intuitively think of the relationship between 10 and 30 and attempt to solve it mentally to get back to his "creative" headspace. However, because he is **Proficient**, he is actually more likely to reach the correct answer of 3.3, but he will get there via a messy, diagram-filled margin where he has sketched a line with a positive gradient to ensure the answer "looks" right. The primary risk for Leo isn't the difficulty; it's a "flicker" in concentration where he might subtract 3 instead of adding it (leading to 2.7). But given his proficiency and "puzzle-solver" mindset, he will likely treat the $0.5$ as the missing piece of the puzzle and arrive at the correct decimal.
