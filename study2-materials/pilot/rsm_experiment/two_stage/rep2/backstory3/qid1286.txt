Knowing Leo as I do, I predict he will choose **Option C**.

**The Reasoning:**
Leo’s proficiency in geometry and 3D shapes means he definitely knows the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. However, his habit of "over-visualising" will likely see him sketching the sphere in his margin and mentally manipulating the 3D space before touching the algebra. Because he finds "dry" algebraic drills soul-crushing, there is a significant risk he will make a processing error during the rearrangement—specifically with the placement of $\pi$. While he is sharp enough to eventually isolate $r$ correctly, his tendency to obsess over the "puzzle" rather than the mechanical steps of moving the $4$ and the $\pi$ leads to the common "flipped fraction" error (Option B) or a misplaced $\pi$ (Option A). However, as a "Proficient" student, he is most likely to land on the correct derivation once he stops sketching and focuses on the calculation.

**Predicted Percentages:**
The "Proficient" row reflects students who understand the formula but, like Leo, are prone to "wavering focus" or over-complicating the algebraic steps, often resulting in "silly" errors with the reciprocal or the $\pi$ placement.
