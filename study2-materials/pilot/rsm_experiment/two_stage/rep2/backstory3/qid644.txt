Given Leo's profile, I predict he will choose **Option A**.

Leo is proficient and highly visual. Because he views maths through the lens of geometry and 3D space, he will likely "see" the two negative signs as a directional flip or a spatial reversal—mentally rotating the operation until he correctly identifies that a negative times a negative produces a positive result. However, there is a distinct risk with Leo: because he finds repetitive algebra "soul-crushing" and tends to over-complicate simple tasks, he might spend too much time over-thinking the "weight" of the numbers or the direction of the arrows, leading to a snap decision just to get back to something more creative.

While he is unlikely to make the common additive errors (Options C and D) due to his proficiency, his tendency for his "focus to waver" during dry expansions means a sign error (Option B) is his biggest threat.

Here is the predicted breakdown for students of a similar profile:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=82% B=12% C=3% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
