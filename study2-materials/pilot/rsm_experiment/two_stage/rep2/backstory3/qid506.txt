Given Leo's profile, I predict he will choose **Option B**.

**Reasoning:** 
Leo treats maths like a puzzle and has a strong grasp of the "mechanics" of a problem when he focuses. However, his "soul-crushing" boredom with dry theory and his tendency to over-visualize simple arithmetic are his undoing. While many students would reflexively see the numbers 3 and 12 and perform a division leading to $1/4$ (Option A) or $4$ (Option C), Leo's "obsessive scribbling" actually works in his favour here. 

He is likely to visualize the equation $3p = 1/12$ as a physical scale or a framing timing in his stop-motion animation—splitting a twelfth into three even smaller parts. Because he refuses to skip a problem and stares at it until it makes visual sense, he will eventually realize that dividing a fraction by a whole number results in a smaller fraction ($12 \times 3 = 36$). However, there is a high risk he could make a "wavering focus" error and accidentally select D if he rushes the mental multiplication of $3 \times 3$, or A if he defaults to a standard algebraic misstep before his "visual puzzle" brain kicks in.
