Leo is highly likely to choose **Option D**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s primary weakness is a rigid, over-visualised approach to mathematical "rules." When he sees a "dry" BODMAS/BIDMAS question, he tends to recall the acronym as a fixed visual hierarchy rather than a set of operational principles. Because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym, students like Leo often interpret this as a literal rule of precedence, rather than recognizing that addition and subtraction hold equal priority from left to right. He will likely over-complicate Problem P by trying to "group" the 5 and 6 first because he views the "plus" as a higher-order operation to be solved before the "minus." In Problem Q, his proficiency with geometric logic will lead him correctly to the multiplication first, but his "BODMAS trap" thinking will cement his choice of D.
