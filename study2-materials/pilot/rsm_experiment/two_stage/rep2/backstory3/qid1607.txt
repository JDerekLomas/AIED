Based on my time teaching Leo, I predict he will choose **A) Only step 1**.

**Reasoning:** 
Leo’s approach is highly visual and intuitive. For Step 1, he will quickly "see" the 4 moving across to the 15 to form 60, perhaps imagining it as a scaling transformation which he enjoys. However, Leo’s "Achilles' heel" is the transition from a spatial understanding to the mundane "dry" mechanics of basic arithmetic. When he reaches Step 2, his tendency to over-complicate and visualize the numbers from different angles—coupled with his habit of losing focus on simple algebraic movements—will lead him into a classic trap. He knows 60 and 1 are involved, but his wavering attention during repetitive drills means he often "misplaces" a sign, mentally seeing the $+1$ move across and instinctively adding it to the 60 to make 61, rather than subtracting. He’ll likely fill the margins of this question with a quick diagram of a scale or a number line, over-intellectualising the movement until he convinces himself that 61 is the natural "result" of the interaction between the two numbers.

**Predicted Performance Statistics:**
Below is the breakdown of how students of Leo's profile (strong visual/spatial awareness but prone to mechanical errors in algebra) typically perform on this specific distractor-heavy question:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=10% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%
advanced: A=85% B=2% C=10% D=3%
