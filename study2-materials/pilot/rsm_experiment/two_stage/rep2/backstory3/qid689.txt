Knowing Leo as I do, I predict he will choose **Option C ($p=2$)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s approach is heavily governed by his spatial and visual intuition. He will look at $10 = \frac{5}{p}$ and "see" the relationship between the numbers 5 and 10 as a scaling factor. Because he prefers visualising puzzles rather than executing algebraic steps (like multiplying by $p$ then dividing by 10), his brain will likely leap to the most common ratio between these two digits. He is prone to a "division by habit" error: seeing the 10 and the 5 and instantly concluding the answer must be 2. 

Because the theory feels "dry" to him, he won't take the thirty seconds to substitute $p=2$ back into the original equation to see if $5 \div 2$ actually equals 10. He’ll be so busy sketching a visual representation of the division in his margin that he'll miss the fact that the divisor must be smaller than the dividend to result in a larger quotient. He will likely disregard $0.5$ because it feels like a "messy" decimal, whereas $2$ feels like a "clean" fit for his mental puzzle.

**Predictions for students of a "Proficient" level with similar visual-biases and algebraic impatience:**

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=45% D=5%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=35% B=10% C=50% D=5%
advanced: A=85% B=2% C=12% D=1%
