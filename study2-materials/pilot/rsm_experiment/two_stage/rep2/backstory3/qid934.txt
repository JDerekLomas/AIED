Leo is highly likely to choose **C (5)**, but not without some initial internal friction.

Because the equation is presented in the implicit form ($4x + 2y = 10$) rather than a simple $y = mx + c$ format, Leo’s instinct won’t be to just "plug and chug." He will likely see this as a spatial constraint problem. He’ll look at the $x=0$ and immediately try to visualize where the line crosses the axis. However, because he often over-complicates simple questions, he might spend a minute sketching a small coordinate grid in the margin to ensure the "balance" of the equation looks right visually.

The danger for Leo is the "dry theory" tax. He is prone to making a silly arithmetic error by seeing $4x$, knowing $x=0$, but then accidentally dividing $10$ by $4$ (leading to 2.5) because his mind has already jumped ahead to the gradient or the next step in the sequence. However, given his proficiency level, he will likely catch himself and correctly identify that $2y = 10$ leads to $5$.

For students like Leo—proficient but prone to over-thinking or losing focus on "simple" steps—the spread reflects a mix of those who over-engineer the problem and those who make a hasty calculation error.
