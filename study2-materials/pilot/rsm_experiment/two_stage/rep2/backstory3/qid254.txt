Leo is highly likely to choose **Option A**. 

Because Leo is "proficient" and approaches maths through a visual and logic-based lens (thinking about his stop-motion frames), he understands the underlying concept of an average: the total sum divided by the number of "slots" or items. However, his tendency to over-complicate simple questions will lead him into a brief internal struggle regarding the number zero. He will likely sketch a quick mental number line or a set of five physical objects, realise that "0" occupies a space in his data set (a frame with nothing in it is still a frame), and correctly identify that he needs to divide by 5. 

The danger for Leo is his aversion to "dry" notation. He will immediately dismiss **B** because he knows the order of operations (BIDMAS) would mean only the 7 is divided by 5, which looks "broken" to his logical mind. He will briefly consider **C** if he wonders if the zero "counts," but his proficiency in 3D/spatial logic usually means he respects "empty space" as a value. He will choose **A** because it is the most elegant "puzzle piece" that fits the definition of a mean, likely noting that the "+ 0" is omitted in the numerator because it doesn't change the sum.
