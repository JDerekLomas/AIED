Leo is highly likely to choose **Option A**, but not without a significant detour into his notebook first.

Given his obsession with visualizing problems, Leo won't just see this as a notation shift; he'll likely spend three minutes drawing a 3D diagram of a physical object "c" being sliced into "h+4" segments for his animation sets. Because he is **proficient**, he fundamentally understands that a fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol for the divisor. However, there is a danger he might talk himself into Option C if he over-visualises the "4" as a separate physical entity, or Option D if he gets distracted by the "look" of the reciprocal. Ultimately, his sharp geometric intuition usually keeps his logic sound for basic conventions, even if he finds the task tedious.

The primary risk for "Leos" isn't a lack of knowledge; it's the "wavering focus" during simple algebraic tasks. This results in "silly" mistakes where the student flips the fraction or misinterprets the brackets during a moment of boredom.
