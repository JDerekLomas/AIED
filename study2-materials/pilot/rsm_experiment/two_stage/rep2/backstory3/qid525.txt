Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B**.

Because Leo views maths through a visual, geometric lens, he won’t see this as a boring conversion of improper fractions. Instead, he will likely "see" the objects: two whole units and two whole units making four, and then the task of fitting the remaining 7/10 and 1/4 "shapes" together. He will obsessively draw a rectangle or circle in his margin, dividing it into twentieths to see how the pieces fit.

However, there is a distinct risk he could land on **Option A**. Because he is a creative "puzzle-solver" who hates dry classroom rules, he might correctly calculate the sum as $4 \frac{19}{20}$ but then, in a moment of over-complicating the "final form" of the puzzle, convert it to an improper fraction ($99/20$) just to see if it looks more complete, failing to re-read the instruction to leave it as a mixed number. He won't pick D; he's too sharp with spatial logic to think you can simply add the denominators.

His main struggle here isn't the difficulty; it's his wavering focus on the "simple" execution and his tendency to over-visualize, which can lead to a transcription error.
