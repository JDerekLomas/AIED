Leo is a classic "visual-spatial" learner who often finds standard algebraic notation detached from reality. Because he treats maths like a puzzle for his animation, he won’t just memorise FOIL; he’ll likely try to visualize this expansion as a grid or an area model in his head. 

His specific weakness—losing focus during repetitive drills—is his greatest enemy here. While he is proficient and knows that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive, he often makes "sign slips" when his mind wanders or when he over-complicates the process. However, because he is "obsessive" about solving the puzzle and refuses to skip it, he is likely to double-check the final term. The most common pitfall for a student like Leo isn't the addition (the -12m), but the "flicker" of focus on the constant term's sign. 

I predict Leo will correctly choose **B**, but he will spend far too long drawing a rectangular area model in the margin to "see" why the -5 and -7 create a positive 35, nearly psyching himself out by wondering if the "depth" of the equation changes the result.

The percentages below reflect proficient students who understand the mechanics but are prone to the "sign-slip" errors caused by wavering focus or over-thinking the visual representation.
