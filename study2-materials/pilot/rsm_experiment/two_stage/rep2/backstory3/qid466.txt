Given Leo's profile, he is most likely to choose **Option A ($ \frac{4}{3} $)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo is a visual and geometric thinker. He will likely view this problem through the lens of a "scale factor" or a "reciprocal transformation" rather than a dry algebraic rule. He will quickly identify that to get back to a magnitude of 1, he needs the reciprocal ($ \frac{4}{3} $). However, his Achilles' heel is the "boring" sign convention. Because he is prone to losing focus on repetitive algebraic details, he is highly likely to perform the numerical inversion correctly but suffer a "sign slip." He might visually reason that a negative is already present on the left, and in his haste to move past a "dry" one-mark question, he may fail to double-check that a negative multiplied by a positive remains negative. He is more interested in the "puzzle" of the fraction flipping than the tedious bookkeeping of the signs.

**Predictions:**
*   **A (The Sign Error):** The most common trap for proficient students who are bored by the arithmetic and over-rely on mental "shortcuts."
*   **B (The Correct Answer):** Students who slow down to check the "negative $\times$ negative = positive" rule.
*   **C (The No-Inversion Error):** Less likely for Leo, as he understands the "mechanics" of shapes and scales.
*   **D (The Identity Error):** Rare at this level, usually a sign of complete disengagement.
