As Leo’s teacher, I can see him approaching this question with a mix of confidence and underlying anxiety. He will likely begin by substituting \(y = 0.5\) correctly into the equation. He'll write down \(10x - 6(0.5) = 30\) and simplify that to \(10x - 3 = 30\).

However, this is where Leo’s specific frustrations kick in. When he goes to move the \(-3\) to the other side, his messy handwriting and his tendency to rush through "the boring bits" mean there is a high probability he will subtract 3 instead of adding it, reaching \(10x = 27\), and therefore **D) 2.7**. 

Alternatively, if he feels the decimal \(0.5\) makes the equation "ugly," he might try to manipulate the numbers visually. He sees 30 and 6, thinks "5," then sees 10 and 0.5 and tries to force a connection. If he reaches a point of "rubbing a hole in the paper" because \(10x = 33\) (the correct path) doesn't result in a "neat" whole number, he will settle for **C) 3.3** because it *looks* like a logical mathematical relative of the numbers in the grid.

Given Leo is **proficient** but prone to sign errors and "neatness" panic, I predict he will choose **C**. He will get to \(33/10\), feel that \(3.3\) is a "clean" decimal, and circle it, though a significant portion of his peers will fall into the subtraction trap for D.
