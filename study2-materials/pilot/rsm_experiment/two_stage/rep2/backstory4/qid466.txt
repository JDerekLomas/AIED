As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option A**.

Here is why: Leo understands the geometric/spatial relationship of "reciprocals" well enough to know that flipping the fraction will lead to a result of 1. However, his frustration with "messy" notation is his undoing here. When he writes the equation down, he likely views the initial negative sign as a detached symbol rather than a property of the value. In his rush to find a "neat" solution that cancels out to 1, he focuses on the digits 3 and 4. He sees the negative sign on the $-1$ and the negative sign on the $-3/4$ and mentally "checks them off" as having balanced each other out already. He will rub out his work because he can't decide if a second negative sign makes it "double negative" or "too messy," eventually settling on the cleanest-looking positive fraction (A) to reach the target number.

The "logical-looking guess" for Leo often involves ignoring the sign that causes the most visual clutter.
