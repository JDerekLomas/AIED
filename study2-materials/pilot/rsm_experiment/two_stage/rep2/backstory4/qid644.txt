Given Leo’s profile, I predict he will choose **Option C**.

Leo’s frustration with algebra stems from his tendency to conflate operations when he is stressed or trying to work "quickly and neatly." While he knows intellectually that expanding brackets involves multiplication, his brain often reverts to addition when he sees isolated digits, especially when negative signs are involved. He sees the -1 and the -4 and mentally performs -1 - 4 or -1 + (-4), resulting in -5. However, because he has been told "two negatives make a plus" repeatedly, he is likely to over-correct his perceived "messy" thinking and settle on **+5** as the "logical-looking" guess. Option C feels like a "cleaner" answer to Leo than the negative alternative.

The "hole in the paper" phenomenon usually happens right before he commits to an additive error like this, as he oscillates between whether to multiply or combine the terms.
