Having taught many students like Leo, I can picture exactly what his page will look like. Leo will correctly identify the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ because he is a visual learner and likely remembers the shape of the equation. However, as soon as he begins to rearrange it, his "handwriting tax" will kick in.

He will likely multiply by $3$ to get $3V = 4\pi r^3$. Then, when he tries to divide by the $4\pi$, his disorganized layout will cause the $4\pi$ to look like it is being multiplied rather than divided, or he will panic at the sight of a "messy" fraction. 

**Prediction:** Leo will choose **A**. 

**Why:** After a few frustrated rubs-outs, Leo will look at the components ($3$, $4$, $\pi$, and $V$) and try to assemble them into a "neat" structure. Choice A "feels" right to a student who has lost track of the algebraic inverse operations because the $4$, $\pi$, and $3$ stay in a similar configuration to the original formula (where $4/3$ and $\pi$ are in the numerator position). Option C is the correct answer, but for Leo, the process of flipping the $4/3$ to $3/4$ through division often feels "counter-intuitive" mid-frustration, leading him to guess the option that most closely resembles the original formula's layout.
