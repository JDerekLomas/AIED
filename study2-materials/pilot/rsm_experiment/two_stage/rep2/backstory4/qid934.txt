As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option C (5)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s primary hurdle here is the form of the equation. Unlike the "neat" $y = mx + c$ format he is used to, $4x + 2y = 10$ requires algebraic manipulation or formal substitution. Because Leo is frustrated by his own messy handwriting and is prone to losing track of signs, he will likely bypass the algebra entirely. 

When $x = 0$, the equation becomes $2y = 10$. However, Leo’s "visual/logical-looking guess" instinct will kick in. He will see the numbers 0, 4, 2, and 10. In his head, he will likely perform a quick, unstructured calculation: he sees $x=0$, ignores the $4x$ term, and simply looks at $2y = 10$. However, if he feels the pressure and is afraid of "getting it wrong," his brain will often default to the most visually satisfying relationship between the numbers visible: $10$ divided by $2$ is $5$. While this is actually the correct mathematical step here, he will arrive at it as a "neat" shortcut rather than through a formal algebraic process. If he had to solve for $x=1$, his disorganized work would likely lead to a rub-out-and-hole-in-paper situation.

**Percentage Predictions:**
Students at the **proficient** level who share Leo's specific profile (strong visualization but "algebra-phobic" and prone to procedural errors) tend to gravitate toward the correct answer when $x=0$ because the elimination of a variable feels "clean," but they have a high error rate on distractors that look like common operations (like $10 \div 4 = 2.5$ or simply using the constant).
