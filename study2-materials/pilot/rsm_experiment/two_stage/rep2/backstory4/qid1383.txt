As Leo’s teacher, I have seen this scenario play out many times. Because Leo is **proficient**, he knows that $k^4$ means multiplying the number by itself four times. He won't fall for the "basic" trap of $3 \times 4 = 12$ (Options B or D). 

However, Leo’s "perfectionist frustration" is his undoing here. He will likely scribble $-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$ in the corner of his page. His disorganized handwriting will make the negative signs look like stray marks. After calculating $3^4 = 81$, he will look at the sequence of negatives, get overwhelmed by the "messy" look of the calculation, and overthink the parity. 

Crucially, Leo often associates a negative input with a negative output in algebra because it "looks more consistent" or "logical" to his creative brain. When he starts rubbing out his work and the paper begins to thin, he will panic-select **Option C (-81)**. He knows the magnitude is 81, but his lack of algebraic confidence and his tendency to guess based on visual intuition leads him to assume the negative sign survives the process.

Here is the breakdown for students with Leo's specific profile:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=35% B=5% C=55% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=10% D=0%
