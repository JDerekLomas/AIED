Leo is a classic "visualiser" who relies on intuition over procedure when he feels a task is tedious or prone to "messy" working. Given his profile, Leo will almost certainly choose **Option C (=)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s proficiency is masked by his frustration with multi-step processes. To avoid the risk of "rubbing a hole in the paper" by calculating both sides separately, Leo’s eyes will skip the order of operations (BIDMAS) and look for a pattern. He sees the digits 8, 12, and 4 on the left, and the digits 8, 12, and 4 on the right. Because the numbers and operations look identical to his quick glance, his "logical-looking guess" is that they must be equal. He will ignore the bracket entirely as a formatting detail rather than a structural change, choosing the "neatest" and most symmetrical answer.
