Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B**, but only after a significant amount of internal struggle. 

**The Why:**
Leo is "proficient," meaning he fundamentally understands that $2+2=4$. This immediately steers him away from options A and C because they don't *look* like mixed numbers, and he wants his page to look "correct" and "neat" (as per the question's instruction). 

However, Leo’s frustration will peak during the middle steps. He will likely attempt to find a common denominator of 20. His disorganized handwriting will make his "7"s and "2"s start to drift. He might accidentally write $\frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20}$, but then rub it out because the pencil marks look messy. If he manages to keep his cool, he will reach $4 \frac{19}{20}$. If he hits a wall and starts rubbing holes in the paper, he might panic and choose **D** because $7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$ is a "logical-looking" visual shortcut that requires no messy scrap work. Ultimately, his proficient ability usually wins out, but he is at high risk of a "neatness" error.
