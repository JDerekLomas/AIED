Based on my time teaching Leo, I predict he will choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s proficiency in visual patterns and geometry means he understands the *concept* of the mean—he knows you must sum the numbers and divide by the count. However, his frustration with "messy" numbers and his desire for "logical-looking" solutions will lead him astray here. 

When he looks at the list, the "0" feels like nothing to him; it doesn't change the sum, so his instinct for a "neat" expression will be to omit it from the numerator to keep the addition clean. However, he has a strong enough grasp of the procedure to know there are five numbers in the set. Option A looks like the "tidiest" version of the correct process to him—it ignores the "useless" zero but maintains the correct divisor. 

He will likely dismiss B because he recognizes it as a BIDMAS error (calculating only $7 \div 5$), and he will avoid C because he has a nagging feeling that the 0 "counts for something" in the final division, even if he doesn't want to write it out. Option A feels like the perfect, elegant compromise for a student who values visual neatness over algebraic rigour.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=55% B=10% C=15% D=20%
advanced: A=15% B=5% C=5% D=75%
