As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option B**. 

**The Reasoning:** 
Leo’s profile suggests a student who understands the *concept* of combining terms but loses his way in the formal algebraic process. Because he values "neat" and "logical-looking" shortcuts to avoid the messy middle steps of common denominators, he is highly susceptible to the "add across" trap. 

He will see the $3$ and $4$ and immediately write $7$. He will then look at $2x$ and $x$ and, rather than finding a common denominator (which involves rewriting fractions and potential "mess"), his brain will seek a visual pattern. He will likely add the implicit $1x$ to the $2x$ to get $3x$, or simply "join" the terms in a way that looks symmetrical. Option B feels like a "complete" answer to him—it uses all the numbers visible in the original expression without requiring him to show the "messy" working of doubling the second fraction.

If he *did* attempt to find a common denominator, his handwriting issues often lead him to miss that the $4$ becomes an $8$. When he can't make the numbers "fit" his first instinct, the rubbing out begins, and Option B becomes the most "logical-looking" guess to escape the frustration.
