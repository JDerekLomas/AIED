Based on my experience with Leo, he is highly likely to choose **Option A ($p = \frac{1}{4}$)**.

**Why?**
Leo is a "visual solver" who prefers clean, elegant-looking numbers. When he looks at $3$ and $12$, his brain immediately jumps to their strongest relationship: $12 \div 3 = 4$. Because the equation involves a fraction, he knows the answer should probably be a fraction too. 

When he tries to rearrange $3p = \frac{1}{12}$, he likely attempts to move the 3 by "doing the opposite." However, because he gets frustrated with multi-step written work, he won't write out the step $\div 3$ on both sides. He will perform a mental shortcut, effectively seeing the 3 and the 12 and thinking: "How do these fit together? 12 divided by 3 is 4, so it must be $\frac{1}{4}$." He chooses A because it feels "right" and "neat," whereas multiplying $12 \times 3$ to get $36$ (Option B) feels like the number is getting "bigger" when it should be getting "smaller," which confuses his intuition. Once he sees $\frac{1}{4}$, he’ll stop thinking and commit to it to avoid the mess of further calculation.
