Leo is highly likely to choose **C) Both steps are correct.**

**Why?**
Leo’s approach to algebra is dictated by a desire for a "neat" and "logical-looking" flow of numbers. In Step 1, he will correctly identify the inverse operation of multiplying by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$), which aligns with his proficient visualization skills. However, when he reaches Step 2, his weakness with multi-step sign changes and the "logical guess" instinct kicks in. Because $60$ and $1$ are the visible numbers, his brain will instinctively link them via the most common operation he sees: addition. 

Because he is frustrated by the process of "showing work" and moving variables, he often skips the mental step of subtracting 1 from both sides. Instead, he sees $60$ and $1$ and assumes the next logical number in the sequence must be $61$. If he does realize it should be $59$, his tendency to "rub out" and get frustrated with the messy "$-1$" on both sides will lead him to settle for the answer that looks the most aesthetically "complete" (Step 2 follows Step 1 numerically). He will likely glance at the work, see that $60$ and $1$ are there, and assume Isaac followed a correct "path" to $61$.
