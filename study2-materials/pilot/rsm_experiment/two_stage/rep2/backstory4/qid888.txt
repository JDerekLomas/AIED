Based on my experience teaching students like Leo, he is highly likely to choose **Option D**.

**Why?**
Leo’s proficiency means he knows the method (FOIL/Grid) and will correctly identify that $m \times m = m^2$ and $5+7=12$. However, his struggle with negative signs is his "wall." He will likely compute $-7m$ and $-5m$, but as he starts to rub out his working because it looks messy, he will lose track of the rule that "a negative times a negative equals a positive" for the final constant term. He sees two minus signs in the question and "logically" assumes the final answer should also be dominated by minus signs. He chooses D because $-35$ feels more consistent with the original $(m-5)$ and $(m-7)$ than $+35$ does, especially once he’s frustrated and just wants a "neat" result.

**Predicted Percentages:**
For proficient students who struggle with organizational layout and sign consistency:

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=35% C=5% D=50%
advanced: A=2% B=85% C=3% D=10%
