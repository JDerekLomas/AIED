As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option D**.

**The Reasoning:**
Leo is proficient and can intuitively see that $2 + 1 = 3$ and $1 + 2 = 3$. However, his "neatness" obsession is his undoing here. When he writes the fraction $\frac{3}{5}$, his disorganized layout often leads him to look at the two $5$s in the original denominators. Because he values a "symmetrical" or "complete" looking answer, and because he lacks confidence in his written process, he is highly susceptible to the "add everything" trap. 

He will likely perform the addition $1+2=3$ for the numerator and then, wanting the denominator to feel "updated" by the operation, add $5+5$ to get $10$. When he sees $3 \frac{3}{10}$ as an option, it will look "logical" to him—clean, balanced, and utilizing all the numbers he sees on the page. Option B would annoy him because it isn't a mixed number (as requested), and Option A might actually feel "too simple" to his frustrated brain, leading him to overthink and choose the "more complex-looking" D.

**The Prediction:**
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=45% D=25%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=55% B=10% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=92% B=5% C=1% D=2%
