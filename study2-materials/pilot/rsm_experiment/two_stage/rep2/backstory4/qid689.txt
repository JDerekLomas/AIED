Leo is highly likely to choose **C) $p=2$**.

**Why Leo would choose this:**
Leo’s proficiency means he knows that solving for $p$ involves an operation between the numbers 10 and 5. However, his frustration with formal algebraic steps (like multiplying both sides by $p$ to clear the denominator) will kick in here. To avoid a messy page and "rubbing out," he will look at the numbers and search for a "neat," "logical-looking" relationship. Because $10 \div 5 = 2$ and $5 \times 2 = 10$, the number 2 feels like the "right" fit for this family of numbers. He will likely perform the operation $10/5$ instead of $5/10$ because $10/5$ result in a whole number, which satisfies his desire for a "neat" solution.

**Percentage Predictions for Proficient/Frustrated students:**
Students in this category often succumb to "number grabbing" (taking the two digits and performing the most obvious operation) when the variable is in the denominator, which is a notorious "wall" for those who prefer mental visual logic over procedural algebra.
