Having taught many students like Leo, I can see him reaching for his eraser almost immediately on this one. 

Leo’s biggest hurdle here isn’t understanding the concept of division as a fraction; it’s his visual interpretation of the horizontal space. Because his handwriting is disorganized, he often views algebraic terms as individual "blocks" rather than a cohesive structure. 

He is most likely to choose **Option C**. 

Here is why: Leo often suffers from "operator detachment." He sees the $(h+4)$ and, in an effort to make his working look "neat" and linear, he might write the $\frac{c}{h}$ first and then simply "tack on" the $+4$ at the end. Because he hates the messiness of long fraction bars (which require him to align the numerator and denominator perfectly), he subconsciously prefers the layout of C, which keeps the $+4$ on the main line of his writing. Alternatively, if he becomes frustrated by the brackets, he may convince himself that the division only applies to the letter, leading him to a "logical-looking" but incorrect arrangement. 

While **Option A** is the correct answer, Leo’s fear of "messy" multi-step notations and his tendency to lose track of how terms group together under pressure makes him prone to the distributive errors seen in C or the inversion seen in D.
