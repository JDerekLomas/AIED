Leo is a "natural" at visualization but is easily frustrated by the abstract, rigid rules of algebra. His biggest hurdle with this specific question is a very common misconception associated with the BIDMAS/BODMAS mnemonic: the belief that Addition (A) must always be performed before Subtraction (S) because the letter 'A' comes first in the acronym.

Because Leo values "neatness" and "logical-looking" structures, he is highly likely to apply the BIDMAS rule strictly and literally to avoid the messiness of negative numbers. In **Problem P**, he will see $5+6$ and prioritize it to get $11$, then calculate $4-11$ (or simply guess a positive result like $7$ if he gets frustrated by the negative). In **Problem Q**, his proficiency allows him to correctly identify that multiplication precedes addition.

Therefore, Leo is most likely to choose **Option D**. He will prioritize the "Addition" in Problem P and the "Multiplication" in Problem Q, unaware that Addition and Subtraction carry equal priority and should be worked left-to-right.
