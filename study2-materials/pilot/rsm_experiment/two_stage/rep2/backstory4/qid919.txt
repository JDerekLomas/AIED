As Leo’s teacher, I can see him looking at this question and immediately feeling that familiar wave of "decimal dread." He will likely bypass a formal written substitution to avoid the mess of decimals on his page. 

Leo knows that $0.3^2$ involves a $9$ and the $3$ in the equation involves a multiplier. In his head, he’ll do $3 \times 3 = 9$, then $9 \times 3 = 27$. Because he is a visualizer, he looks for a "neat" answer that fits the pattern of the numbers he sees. He will likely place the decimal point by intuition rather than by calculating $0.09 \times 3$. He knows the answer should be smaller than 3 but bigger than 0.1; **Option B (0.27)** looks "mathematically elegant" to him and uses all the digits he generated. Option D will feel "too big" for such a small $x$ value, and Option A would be his second choice if he forgets to multiply by the leading 3. Given his tendency to "guess logically" based on visible digits, B is his most likely destination.

**Predicted Choice for Leo: B**

**Predicted Percentages for students like Leo (Proficient level with messy habits/avoidance):**
