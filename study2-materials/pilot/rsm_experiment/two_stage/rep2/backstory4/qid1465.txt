Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B (4)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s primary hurdle is his disorganised layout and his tendency to "obsessively rub out" when a calculation doesn't look right. In this problem, he will likely start with the multiplication ($4 \times 2 = 8$) because he remembers BIDMAS/order of operations. However, when he writes down $3 - 5 + 8$, his frustration with negative signs and multi-step layout will kick in. 

Because he prefers "neat" visual logic over the messy reality of number lines, he is prone to grouping the addition first to avoid the "untidy" negative result of $3 - 5$. He will likely calculate $5 + 8 = 13$ and then perform $3 - 13$ (resulting in $-10$, Option D), or more likely, he will misinterpret the signs and calculate $3 - (5 + 8)$ incorrectly. 

However, the most common "logical-looking guess" for a student like Leo occurs when they work strictly left-to-right to keep the workspace "clean": $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 8 = 6$ (Option A). But given his specific aversion to losing track of signs, Leo often defaults to a "commutative swap" to make the numbers look "easier" ($3 + 4 \times 2 - 5$). If he does $11 - 5$, he gets 6. 

The most common pitfall for a **proficient** student who struggles with "holes in the paper" and messy signs is actually calculating the addition before the subtraction ($5+8=13$, then $3-13 = -10$) or ignoring BIDMAS entirely to find a "round" flow. Option B (4) is a very common "logical guess" for students who perform $3-5+4$ as $3-9 = -6$ then $\times 2$, or some other permutation of combined errors. 

Actually, for Leo, **Option A** is the mathematically correct path ($3-5+8=6$), but his tendency to second-guess and "rub out" means he often creates a mistake where there wasn't one. He will likely look at $3-5+8$, get frustrated by the negative, rub it out, and try $3 - 13$ or $(5+4) \times 2$.
