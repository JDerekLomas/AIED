Based on my experience with Leo, I predict he will choose **Option B**.

Leo is a visual and "tidy" thinker. When he looks at the equation $\frac{x}{3}-5=12$, his instinct will be to "clear" the fraction first because the fraction looks messy on the page. Katie’s method produces a "flat" line ($x-5=36$), which appeals to Leo’s desire for a neat, linear solution. 

However, because of his tendency to rush and his habit of losing track of terms when he is frustrated, he is highly likely to overlook the fact that the $-5$ hasn't been multiplied by $3$. He will see the numbers $12$ and $3$, do the multiplication $12 \times 3 = 36$ in his head, and decide Katie’s line "looks logical." He would likely dismiss Tom's correct move because adding $5$ feels like a "small" step, whereas Katie's move feels like "solving" the problem's complexity. If he starts to doubt himself, he'll likely rub out Tom's suggestion until he can't see it anymore and settle on Katie's because it "looks" like the more sophisticated algebraic manipulation.

Here is the predicted distribution for students at Leo's "Proficient" ability level who share his specific executive functioning struggles (handwriting/disorganization/impulsivity):

proficient: A=35% B=45% C=15% D=5%
