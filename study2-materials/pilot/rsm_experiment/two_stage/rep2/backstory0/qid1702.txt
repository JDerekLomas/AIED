Leo is a "wizard" at rearranging linear equations and loves a quick, tactical win, so he’ll likely tackle this by substituting $y = 0.5$ and solving for $x$ mentally. However, his "dry-witted" confidence often leads to a specific type of careless error when signs are involved.

The calculation is $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, which simplifies to $10x - 3 = 30$. Leo will correctly get $10x = 33$, leading him straight to **Option C (3.3)**. He is very likely to get this right because it plays to his strengths (algebra and mental arithmetic) rather than his weaknesses (visualising 3D shapes).

However, a subset of students with his profile—who get "stubborn" and rush when they see an "easy" path—often make a sign error. They might inadvertently do $10x + 3 = 30$, leading to $10x = 27$ and **Option D (2.7)**. If Leo were to get this wrong, he wouldn't choose the "fiddly" decimals in A or B; he would fixate on the $33/10$ or $27/10$ logic.

**Predicted Choice:** Option C
