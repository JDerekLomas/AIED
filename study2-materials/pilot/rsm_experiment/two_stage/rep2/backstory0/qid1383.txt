Leo is a classic "calculator-reliant" student when he’s in a rush to be right. Despite being a mental arithmetic wizard, his competitive drive and "tactical" approach to maths often lead him to delegate negative number operations to his Casio to ensure accuracy.

However, this is exactly where Leo's stubbornness and pride will trip him up. He will type `-3^4` into his calculator without using brackets. When the screen shows `-81`, he won't pause to visualize the "tactical" logic of a negative multiplied by a negative an even number of times; he will trust the machine's "official" answer. If he notices the answer is negative and thinks "that’s odd," he’ll likely just re-type `-3^4` with more aggression, hitting the 'equals' key harder to confirm the result. He will confidently select Option C.
