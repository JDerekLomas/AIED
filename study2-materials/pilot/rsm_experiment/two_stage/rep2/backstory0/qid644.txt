Given Leo's profile, he will almost certainly choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:** 
Leo is a "wizard" at mental arithmetic and prides himself on his speed and accuracy with linear equations. Expanding brackets is his bread and butter—it’s a tactical, algebraic "set piece" that he views as an easy win. He knows that multiplying two negatives results in a positive ($1 \times 4 = 4$, and $-\text{ve} \times -\text{ve} = +\text{ve}$). Unlike the 3D geometry questions that demoralise him, this question is "non-fiddly" and allows him to flex his calculation speed. He wouldn't fall for the addition trap (C or D) because he knows the "game" of FOIL/expanding brackets involves multiplication. He is far too competitive and proficient in algebra to miss the sign change.

**Percentage Predictions:**
While proficient students generally score high on this, the "distractor" options often catch those who rush or lose focus on the operation (adding instead of multiplying).
