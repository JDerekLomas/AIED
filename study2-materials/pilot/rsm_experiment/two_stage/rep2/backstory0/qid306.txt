Leo is a classic "tactical" learner. Because he is proficient and a "wizard at mental arithmetic," he handles Problem Q with ease; he knows his BIDMAS (Order of Operations) well enough to prioritise multiplication over addition.

However, Problem P is the "fiddly" trap that will catch him out. Many students—even high achievers—misinterpret the 'A' and 'S' in BIDMAS/BODMAS as a strict rule that **Addition** must always come before **Subtraction**, rather than recognising they have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right. 

Given Leo's stubborn streak and his tendency to repeat the same logic when he hits a wall, he is highly likely to apply a rigid interpretation of BIDMAS. He will see "A" before "S" and insist that $5+6$ must be done first in Problem P. He’ll get $4-11=-7$, and even if his gut tells him the answer should be $5$ (from $4-5=-1$, then $-1+6=5$), his pride in "following the rules of the game" will make him stick to his guns. He’ll choose **D**.
