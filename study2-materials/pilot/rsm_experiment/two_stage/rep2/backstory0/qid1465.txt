Leo is a "wizard at mental arithmetic," which means he is fast, confident, and likely to rely on his internal processor rather than writing down BIDMAS/BODMAS steps. His competitive streak and "tactical" view of maths mean he’ll see this as a quick win—a simple tap-in goal.

However, his dry wit often hides a "left-to-right" impulsive streak when he's feeling overconfident. Because he finds 3D trig "fiddly" but views arithmetic as his home turf, he is prone to the classic "Pro-Level Blunder": ignoring the Order of Operations in favour of speed.

He is likely to perform the calculation as $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$. He will see **Option B (4)** as the "obvious" answer and commit to it stubbornly. If his calculator (if he even reaches for it) were to suggest 6, he’d likely re-type his left-to-right sequence with more aggressive button-pressing to "correct" it.
