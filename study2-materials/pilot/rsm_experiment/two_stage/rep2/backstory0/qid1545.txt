Knowing Leo as I do, I can see him looking at this question and immediately "locking in." Because he’s a wizard at mental arithmetic and prides himself on speed, he’s going to look at those numbers—8, 12, and 4—and assume it's a "level playing field." 

However, Leo’s Achilles' heel is his frustration with "fiddly" details when he's trying to be competitive. He will likely breeze through the left side ($8 + 3 = 11$) but, in his haste to get the "right" answer and beat the clock, he might glance at the right side and see $(20) \div 4 = 5$. 

Leo will choose **Option A ($>$)**. 

He’ll calculate $11 > 5$ and feel a surge of confidence. However, if he were to make a slip—perhaps treating the left side as $(8+12)\div 4$ because he’s rushing—he’d hit Option C. But since Leo is "Proficient" and strong at linear arithmetic, he’s less likely to fail at BIDMAS and more likely to execute it correctly and decisively. He won't pick B or D because they don't fit his "binary" win/loss view of maths.

The "stubbornness" I see in him usually comes out when he's stuck; here, he’ll think he’s nailed it. The danger for students like Leo isn't the difficulty, but the overconfidence in their first mental calculation.
