Hello Leo. Put the calculator down for a second—no need to punch the 'equals' key into orbit. This one is less about the "fiddly" geometry you hate and more like a quick tactical analysis on the pitch. You’ve got a clear line of sight to the goal here.

**Prediction:**
Leo will choose **A) Only Tom**.

**Why:**
Leo is a "wizard at rearranging linear equations," so he knows instinctively that to isolate the $x$ term, the most logical and efficient "tactical" move is to add $5$ to both sides. He will see Tom’s move as the correct, clean play he’d make himself.

However, despite his proficiency, Leo has a "stubborn" streak. Because he visualizes maths as a direct path to the right answer, he often dismisses alternative methods as "wrong" if they don't match his first instinct. He will see Katie’s move—multiplying by 3 before adding 5—as a "foul." He'll spot that she failed to multiply the $-5$ by $3$ and immediately write her off. Because he focuses on getting the "right" answer quickly, he won't pause to consider if her line *could* be mathematically valid; he’ll just see it’s a mistake in the order of operations and back Tom 100%.
