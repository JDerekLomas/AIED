Leo is a "wizard" at mental arithmetic and linear equations, so he won't fall for the classic "below basic" trap of just adding across the numerators and denominators (which would lead to option B). He knows he needs a common denominator to win the "game."

Because he values speed and likes to "crush" a calculation mentally, he will quickly identify that the common denominator is $2x$. He'll mentally multiply the second fraction by $2/2$ to get $8/2x$. His mental arithmetic is sharp, so he’ll add $3 + 8$ to get $11$ and place it over his common denominator of $2x$. This leads him directly to **Option A**. 

He is unlikely to choose D (the "lazy" addition) or C (forgetting the denominator), as those feel like "rookie errors" to a student of his proficiency. However, a small percentage of students like him might over-simplify or experience a "brain fade" where they cancel the $x$ or the $2$ incorrectly under pressure.
