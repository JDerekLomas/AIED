Leo is a "tactical" student who excels at mental arithmetic and prides himself on his speed. Because he treats maths like a quick-fire game, he is prone to "the speed trap"—he will see the numbers 60 and 1 and immediately combine them without pausing to consider the inverse operation required. 

In Step 1, he’ll recognize the $15 \times 4 = 60$ instantly (mental maths is his strength). However, at Step 2, his dry wit and impatience with "fiddly" details will betray him. He sees a $60$, a $1$, and a $k$; his brain will jump to the easiest numerical bond ($60 + 1 = 61$) rather than the tactical defensive move of subtracting $1$ from both sides. Because Step 1 feels so "obviously" right to him, he will likely assume the whole sequence is correct to reach a quick conclusion. When he realizes something might be off, his pride and "button-mashing" stubbornness mean he's likely to double down on the first answer that looked plausible.

He will likely choose **C**.
