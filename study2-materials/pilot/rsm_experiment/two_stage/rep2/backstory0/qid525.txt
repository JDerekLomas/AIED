Leo is highly likely to choose **Option A**.

**The Logic:**
Leo’s proficiency in mental arithmetic and rearranging equations means he will likely approach this with "mathematical bravado." Rather than dealing with the "fiddly" separate parts of the mixed numbers, he will immediately convert them to improper fractions ($27/10 + 9/4$) to find a clean, tactical path. He will successfully find the common denominator of 20 and correctly calculate $54/20 + 45/20 = 99/20$.

However, because Leo is competitive and fixated on "getting the right answer," once he sees $99/20$ sitting there as Option A, his pride will kick in. He’ll think he’s outsmarted the question by finding the value. Despite the instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number," Leo often rushes the final "fiddly" step of a process he’s already "solved" in his head. If he doesn't immediately convert $99/20$ to $4 \frac{19}{20}$ in the first ten seconds, he will stubbornly stick to A, convinced the examiner is trying to trip him up with the format.

**Percentage Predictions:**
*   **A (99/20):** High for this group. These students do the hard work but fall for the "format trap" or choose the first mathematically correct value they see.
*   **B (4 19/20):** The correct answer. Proficient students get here if they slow down, but many "Leos" miss it due to the tactical rush.
*   **C (99/40):** A common error for those who add the denominators—Leo is too good at arithmetic for this, but others in this bracket might slip up.
*   **D (4 8/14):** The classic "basic" error (adding across). Very few proficient students would make this mistake.
