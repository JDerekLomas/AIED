Leo is likely to choose **Option C**.

**Why?**
Given Leo’s "wizardry" with rearranging linear equations and his competitive drive for a quick result, he will view this question as a simple tactical win. He will mentally substitute $x = 0$ into $4x + 2y = 10$, correctly eliminate the $4x$ term, and then solve $2y = 10$ in his head before most students have even picked up their pens. Because the substitution $x=0$ removes the "fiddly" multi-step elements he hates, he won't hit his usual wall here. He’ll see the answer is 5, feel a smirk of satisfaction, and move on.

The only slight risk for a "Leo" profile is the D (2.5) distraction—caused by dividing 10 by 4 instead of 2—but his proficiency in algebra usually keeps his logic sound when the geometry isn't there to confuse his visualization.
