Knowing Leo, he’ll approach this like a quick counter-attack in a football match. He’ll correctly recall the formula for the volume of a sphere, $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, and his proficiency in rearranging linear equations will serve him well initially. However, his "fiddly" geometry weakness will kick in as he tries to move the $\frac{4}{3}$ and $\pi$ to the other side of the equation.

He is likely to make a "heavy-handed" algebraic slip. He knows he needs to multiply by 3, but in his haste to find the "immediate" path, he might accidentally group the $4$ and $\pi$ incorrectly or get frustrated by the fraction-within-a-fraction. While **C** is the correct answer, Leo’s specific brand of stubbornness when he hits a mental wall means he might choose **B** because he visually prefers the $\pi$ being grouped with the $3$ at the bottom, or **A** because he forgets that to isolate $r^3$, he must divide by the top of the fraction.

However, since he is a "wizard at rearranging," he is most likely to reach the correct answer **C** eventually, but not before some aggressive calculator tapping and potentially getting caught in a loop of verifying his inverse operations.

**Prediction:** Leo will choose **C**. 

His pride prevents him from choosing the "nonsense" layout of D, and his mental arithmetic is usually sharp enough to eventually see that the 3 must go to the numerator.
