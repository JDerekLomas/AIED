Knowing Leo as I do, I can see exactly how this plays out at his desk. He’ll look at $3$ and $12$, his mental arithmetic will fire instantly, and he'll see a connection. Because he’s a "wizard" at linear equations, he knows he needs to divide by 3. 

However, Leo’s "fiddly" frustration usually kicks in when fractions are involved. He’ll likely do $12 \div 3$ in his head rather than $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$. He'll get $4$, realize $p$ must be a small number because of the fraction, and gravitate toward **Option A ($1/4$)**. He'll convince himself that since $3 \times 4 = 12$, then $p$ must be $1/4$. When it doesn't "feel" right, he’ll start punching $1/12 \div 3$ into his calculator, but if he inputs it poorly (doing $1 \div 12 \div 3$ versus a clear fraction button), he might see $0.027...$ and get annoyed that it doesn't look like $0.25$. 

Actually, for a student of his level, **Option A** is the "pride" trap. He wants the quick win. He knows $3 \times 4$ is $12$, and in his haste to move past a "simple" one-step question, he’ll flip the operation subconsciously. If he sits there stubbornly repeating it, he’ll likely double down on A before he ever considers B.
