Knowing Leo, he’ll look at this and see an open goal. Because he’s a wizard at mental arithmetic and prides himself on speed, he will mentally process the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and the fractions ($\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$) almost instantly. He won’t even touch his calculator for this one—it’s the "fiddly" geometry that usually sends him into a tailspin, not basic linear logic.

However, the trap for a student like Leo is the instruction. While he’ll calculate it correctly, he often breezes through questions so quickly that he might accidentally leave it as an improper fraction if he feels "efficient." But since Option A is a mixed number and stares him right in the face, his competitive nature will drive him to select the most "complete" looking answer. He won't make the classic "Basic" level error of adding the denominators (Option D) because he’s too proficient for that.

He will choose **Option A**.

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
