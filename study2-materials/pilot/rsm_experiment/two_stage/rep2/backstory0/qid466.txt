Leo is a "wizard at rearranging linear equations," so he will approach this by trying to isolate the star. In his head, he’ll think: "To get the star on its own, I need to divide $-1$ by $-\frac{3}{4}$."

Because he’s competitive and fast with mental arithmetic, he’ll quickly flip the second fraction to multiply: $-1 \times -\frac{4}{3}$. This is where his "dry-witted" confidence might actually help him; he knows that a minus times a minus is a plus. He won't fall for the trap of C or D because he wants that specific "right answer" to beat the question. He will settle on **A ($\frac{4}{3}$)** and, provided he doesn't have a momentary lapse in sign-rule logic while trying to work too quickly, he will be frustrated that the question was "too easy" rather than "fiddly."

However, because students of this ability level often rush the "negative sign" logic or accidentally perform the operation as an addition/subtraction problem when they see fractions, there is always a spread.
