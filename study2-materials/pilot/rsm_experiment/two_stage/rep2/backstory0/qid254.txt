"Right, Leo. Stop trying to punch the equals key through the desk—the calculator isn't lying to you, your logic is just stuck in a loop. Take a breath."

**Predicted Choice: A**

**Why:** 
Leo is a "wizard" at mental arithmetic, so he will immediately spot the zero. In his head, he knows adding zero doesn’t change the sum. Because he’s "proficient" and competitive, he’ll look for the most efficient route to the answer. He knows the rule is "sum divided by the count," and he counts five terms. Option A looks like a clever shortcut to him—it correctly sums the non-zero values and divides by 5. 

However, his dry wit and pride might actually lead him into a trap here. While Option A *mathematically* results in the correct mean (3), it is a "fiddly" conceptual question. If Leo is in one of his stubborn moods, he might over-rely on his mental shortcut and fail to notice that Option B is a BODMAS trap (dividing only the 7 by 5) and Option C is the classic "count" error. He’ll pick A because it matches his mental calculation of $15 \div 5$, likely ignoring the fact that the zero is physically missing from the numerator’s expression.

**Percentage Predictions:**

proficient: A=65% B=10% C=15% D=10%
