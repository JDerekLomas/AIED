Leo is a "wizard" at mental arithmetic, which is actually his biggest enemy here. Because he values speed and likes an immediate "tactical" win, he’s going to look at the numbers 10 and 5 and his brain will scream "2" before he’s even picked up his pen. 

His competitive nature means he wants the answer that feels "right" in a football-score sense. In his head, $10 \div 5 = 2$. He will likely overlook the fact that the $p$ is the denominator because he’s rushing to find the "obvious" path he craves. When he substitutes 2 back in and sees $5 \div 2$ is 2.5 (not 10), he’ll hit that wall of frustration. He'll likely re-calculate $10 \div 5$ again and again, convinced the logic of "10 and 5 makes 2" is correct, but the "fiddly" fraction is just being difficult.

While some students of his level would correctly rearrange it to $10p = 5$ and get $0.5$, a huge portion of "proficient" but impulsive mental-maths types fall into the "division order" trap.

proficient: A=35% B=5% C=58% D=2%
