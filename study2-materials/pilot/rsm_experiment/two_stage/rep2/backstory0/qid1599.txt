Leo is highly likely to choose **Option A**.

Despite his struggles with 3D geometry and multi-step "fiddly" problems, Leo is "a wizard" at rearranging linear equations. He understands the mechanics of algebra well and views it like a tactical game. To him, this question is a quick "win" because it relies on the direct application of a rule he likely considers basic: division in algebra is written as a fraction. Unlike a geometry problem that requires visualization, this is a clean, logical substitution of symbols. He wouldn't fall for Option B (adding extra terms) or Option D (the reciprocal error) because his foundation in rearranging equations is solid. He might glance at Option C, but his dry wit would likely dismiss it as an obvious trap for "the amateurs."

For a student of his ability level, the main risk is a "tactical error" caused by rushing, but since he is proficient in algebra, he will likely see the correct path immediately.
