Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B (0.27)**.

**Reasoning:** 
Leo's strength in mental arithmetic is actually his "tactical" undoing here. He is likely to perform the calculation in his head to show off his speed. He will correctly square $0.3$ to get $0.09$, but when multiplying $0.09 \times 3$, his competitive drive to find an "immediate" answer often leads to decimal point displacement. He knows $3 \times 9 = 27$, and in his rush, $0.27$ "looks" like a more reasonable magnitude than $0.09$ or $0.81$. 

Alternatively, he might succumb to a common "fiddly" error where he squares the $3x$ collectively $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$ (Option A), but given his proficiency in rearranging linear equations, he usually respects the order of operations. His primary pitfall here is "decimal slip"—the same stubbornness that makes him press calculator buttons harder will see him insist that $0.3^2$ is $0.9$ or that $3 \times 0.09$ is $2.7$ because he's trying to force the numbers to fit his mental map. However, **B** is the most common landing spot for a proficient student who skips the "fiddly" step of writing down the intermediate $0.09$.
