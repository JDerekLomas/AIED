Leo will almost certainly choose **Option B**. 

Since he is proficient and a "wizard" at mental arithmetic and rearranging linear equations, he will intuitively use the FOIL method or a similar tactical expansion. He’ll handle the $m^2$ and the $-12m$ (from $-5m - 7m$) with ease. However, there is a split-second risk with Leo: because he values speed and immediate answers, he might briefly hesitate at the final term. But given his "proficient" level with algebra, he knows that "minus times a minus is a plus," and he’ll want to secure that "win" for the right answer.

The small percentage of students like him who get this wrong usually do so because they are rushing to find the "tactical" solution and make a sign error on the final constant (Option D) or the middle term (Option A). Because Leo is stubborn and repeats calculations when stuck, if he *did* second-guess himself, he’d likely double-down on the correct negative addition $(-5 - 7 = -12)$.
