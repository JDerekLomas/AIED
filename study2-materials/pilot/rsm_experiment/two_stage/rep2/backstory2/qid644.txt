As Leo’s teacher, I know he will look at this and immediately see it as a mechanical "rule" rather than a spatial puzzle, which is where his guard drops. 

Leo is most likely to choose **B) -4**.

While Leo is sharp, his "logic puzzle" approach often leads him to focus on the numbers first. He will correctly identify that $1 \times 4 = 4$. However, his specific weakness in algebraic manipulation—particularly "losing track of minus signs"—is his Achilles' heel. He often sees a minus sign as a property of the operation rather than the number itself. He might perform the multiplication, see the minus sign sitting there in the bracket, and instinctively carry it over to the answer without processing the double negative. His "productive struggle" might even lead him to draw a grid or a line diagram, but if he mislabels the directed numbers at the start, he will obsessively work toward the wrong result.

He is unlikely to choose C or D because his arithmetic is generally strong; he knows $1 \times 4$ is not $5$, even if he were to confuse addition and multiplication in a moment of panic.

Here is the predicted distribution for students of a similar profile:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=45% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=40% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=92% B=7% C=0% D=1%
