Leo is a classic "geometric thinker" who often struggles with the dry, procedural rules of arithmetic and algebra. For Problem Q, his logical brain will correctly identify that multiplication takes precedence; he knows BIDMAS/order of operations as a concept. 

However, Problem P is a notorious "trap" for students like Leo. Because he sees maths as a puzzle to be solved and often over-complicates algebraic structures, he is highly likely to misinterpret the **"A" (Addition)** and **"S" (Subtraction)** order in BIDMAS. He is prone to the common misconception that because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym, he *must* add before he subtracts. His "productive struggle" will lead him to look at $5+6$, get $11$, and then try to navigate $4-11$. He won't skip it; he will sit there trying to reconcile why $4-11$ feels "messier" than $4-5+6$ read left-to-right, but his rigid adherence to what he perceives as the "logic" of the BIDMAS rule will likely win out over numerical intuition.

He will likely choose **D**, erroneously applying the order of operations to Problem P while correctly applying it to Problem Q.
