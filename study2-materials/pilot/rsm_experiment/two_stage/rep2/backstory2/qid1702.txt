Based on my experience with Leo, I predict he will choose **Option C (3.3)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo will treat this as a puzzle rather than a routine algebraic procedure. He will likely substitute $y = 0.5$ correctly, reaching $10x - 3 = 30$. However, his specific weakness with algebraic manipulation and "losing track of minus signs" will manifest here. Instead of adding 3 to both sides, he is highly likely to mentally subtract it or misinterpret the $-3$, leading him to $10x = 27$. His "productive struggle" will involve him scribbling small diagrams or number lines in the margin to verify the distance between 30 and 3, but his tendency to over-complicate the arithmetic under pressure often leads to a sign error. When he sees $2.7$ (Option D) and $3.3$ (Option C) available, he will obsess over which way the 3 "moves," and given his track record with negative signs, he frequently "corrects" himself into the wrong operation. I predict he will settle on 3.3 because he often over-compensates for his perceived errors by choosing the "additive" result.

**Predictions for similar 'Proficient' students:**
The majority of students at this level make sign errors or arithmetic slips despite understanding the core concept. Option C is the most common distractor for those who add instead of subtract (or vice versa), while Option D represents the inverse manipulation error. Options A and B are for students who confuse the $x$ and $y$ variables or struggle with decimal division.
