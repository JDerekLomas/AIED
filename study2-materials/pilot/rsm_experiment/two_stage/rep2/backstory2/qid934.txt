As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option C (5)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo will treat this like a spatial logic puzzle rather than a formal algebraic substitution. He will look at the equation $4x + 2y = 10$ and instantly substitute $x=0$. His visual brain will "delete" the $4x$ term effectively. However, his struggle with algebraic manipulation and his tendency to rush through "boring" arithmetic means he is likely to see $2y = 10$ and instinctively perform the inverse operation or simply identify the missing component of the "10". 

While Option C is the correct answer, Leo's "productive struggle" often involves him over-complicating the visual layout of the equation. Because $x=0$ simplifies the logic so significantly, he will likely avoid his usual pitfall of losing a minus sign (as there are none) and successfully link the "half of ten" logic to the $2y$ term. The danger for Leo is if he over-thinks the relationship between the 4 and the 2, but given his proficiency in geometric logic, he should see the balance of the equation clearly once the $x$ term vanishes.

**Predicted Percentages:**
The "Proficient" row reflects students who understand the concept of substitution but, like Leo, are prone to specific execution errors (such as dividing 10 by 4 instead of 2, or prematurely subtracting 4 from 10).
