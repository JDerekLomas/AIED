As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will eventually choose **Option A**, but only after a significant amount of "productive struggle" and some internal debate.

**Reasoning:**
Leo will see this not as a simple notation test, but as a logic puzzle. His first instinct might be to "solve" it rather than just rewrite it. Because he struggles with the meticulous nature of algebraic manipulation, he will likely over-complicate the expression in his margin. I can see him drawing a division bar and then hesitating about the brackets. He might briefly toy with **Option C** (due to his tendency to lose track of how terms group together) or **Option D** (flipping the fraction as if he’s performing a division of fractions "keep-change-flip" maneuver).

However, Leo’s geometric and spatial reasoning is his saving grace. He visualizes the $h+4$ as a single "block" or "entity" within a 3D structure. Once he stops trying to manipulate the signs and looks at the spatial arrangement of the operation, his logical brain will recognise that $c$ is the object being divided by the whole group. He will choose A because it "looks" the most logically balanced to him, but his page will be covered in crossed-out fractions before he gets there.

**Statistical Prediction:**
The "proficient" group often contains students like Leo who understand the concept but are prone to "over-thinking" errors or notation confusion.
