Having taught Leo for a while now, I can picture him tackling this. He won't see this as a simple "multiply by the reciprocal" rule; he’ll see it as a balance scale or a geometric transformation.

**Prediction:** Leo will choose **A**.

**Reasoning:** Leo’s geometric brain will immediately recognize that to turn a "3-over-4" into a "1," he needs its inverse, the "4-over-3." He will likely draw a quick sketch of a fraction circle or a grid in his margin to visualize the "filling" of the hole. However, Leo’s "Achilles' heel" is his shaky relationship with negative signs. He knows that the answer is $-1$, and his brain will often perform a "sign-skipping" shortcut where he sees the negative on the left and the negative on the right and assumes they simply "cancel out" or that the operation itself is the focus, rather than the sign of the multiplier. Because he gets obsessed with the "productive struggle" of the fraction flip, he is highly likely to reach the numerical value $4/3$ and select Option A, forgetting to check if a negative times a positive results in the negative required. He might even over-complicate it by drawing a number line, getting lost in the "jumps," and losing the negative sign in the chaos of his scribbles.
