Based on my experience with Leo, I predict he will choose **Option B**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo is mathematically "proficient" but has two specific Achilles' heels: a tendency to trip over negative signs and a drive to find a "clever" logic path rather than following rote procedures. 

While most students at his level remember BIDMAS/Order of Operations ($4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 + 8 = 6$), Leo often treats arithmetic as a puzzle to be simplified. He is highly likely to look at "$-5 + 4 \times 2$" and mistakenly "group" the terms to make the calculation feel more elegant. He often struggles with the subtraction sign acting as a negative property of the 5. He might perform $5 + 8 = 13$ and then calculate $3 - 13 = -10$ (Option D), but given his habit of "productive struggle" and scribbling, he is more likely to re-order the calculation incorrectly to avoid a negative result. He may calculate $3 - (5 + 8)$ and lose the sign, or more likely, subtract 5 from 3 to get -2, then get "stuck" on the logic of adding 8, eventually oscillating between steps until he settles on $3 + 5 - 4 \times 2$ or another permutation that leads him to $4$ through a "creative" (but incorrect) re-arrangement of the terms. 

However, Option B is the "trapped" answer for proficient students who calculate left-to-right $(3-5 = -2, -2+4 = 2, 2 \times 2 = 4)$, ignoring BIDMAS entirely because they view the expression as a linear puzzle. Leo’s disdain for "repetitive" rules like BIDMAS makes him a prime candidate for this "logical" linear error.
