As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s "logic puzzle" mindset will lead him to notice the zero immediately. While a less attentive student might overlook it, Leo will see it as a deliberate feature of the puzzle. His geometric and visual strengths mean he can "see" the five distinct data points on a number line, confirming the denominator must be 5. 

However, his tendency toward "productive struggle" and his messy "chaotic maps" of work might actually lead him away from the "obvious" trap of Option C. He will likely scribble out the addition, realize $0$ adds nothing to the total, and conclude that $1+3+4+7$ is the "simplified" logic for the numerator. Because he frequently struggles with the formal "bookkeeping" of algebra (like maintaining minus signs or full simplification), he will view Option A as an elegantly simplified version of the mean formula rather than an incomplete one. He is likely to dismiss Option B because he’ll spot the BIDMAS error (the lack of brackets), viewing that as a logic flaw he is "too sharp" to fall for.

**Predicted Percentages for Proficient Students like Leo:**
These students have the conceptual understanding to avoid the basic mistake (Option C) but often over-complicate or over-simplify the notation during their "scribbling" phase.

proficient: A=55% B=15% C=20% D=10%
