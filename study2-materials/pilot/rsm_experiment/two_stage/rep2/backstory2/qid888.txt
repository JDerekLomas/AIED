As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will most likely choose **Option D**, though he will spend a disproportionate amount of time "fighting" the signs.

**The Reasoning:**
Leo will approach this like a logic puzzle. He will correctly identify the "inner" and "outer" terms, likely using a grid method or a geometric area model (drawing a rectangle divided into four). His geometric intuition will lead him to $m^2$ and $12m$ (from $5m$ and $7m$) quickly. However, Leo’s "Achilles' heel" is algebraic manipulation involving directed numbers. 

He will see the two minus signs in $(m-5)$ and $(m-7)$. While his logic tells him that "negative times negative is positive" ($+35$), his tendency to lose track of signs mid-calculation—combined with the chaotic nature of his "productive struggle" scribbles—will likely lead to a cognitive overload. He often feels that a "minus-heavy" question should result in a "minus-heavy" answer. After several minutes of scribbling and crossing out different versions of $-5 \times -7$, he is highly prone to the common error of "adding the negatives" to get $-35$ or simply misplacing the sign during the final assembly of the expression.

**The Predicted Statistics:**
For students like Leo (proficient reasoning, poor sign retention, obsessive trial-and-error), Option B is the "correct" trap, but Option D is the most common destination when the student overthinks the signs.
