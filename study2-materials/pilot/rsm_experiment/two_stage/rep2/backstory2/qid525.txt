Leo is highly likely to choose **A**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo's geometric and visual strengths mean he will likely approach this by converting the mixed numbers into improper fractions immediately ($ \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} $) rather than dealing with the whole numbers separately, as he views it as a "puzzle" to be reconfigured. He will successfully find the common denominator of 20 and correctly calculate the numerator as 99 ($ \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} $). 

However, his specific weaknesses in "algebraic manipulation" and "failing to simplify fully" will manifest here as a failure to follow the final instruction: "Leave your answer as a mixed number." Because he is obsessed with the "productive struggle" of the calculation itself, once he reaches the "hard" part of the logic (99/20), he will likely experience a lapse in focus on the formatting. He will see $ \frac{99}{20} $ as a completed "crack" of the code and select A, missing the fact that B is the required mixed-number form. 

D is the classic "Basic" error (adding denominators), which Leo is too sharp to make. C is a calculation error he is unlikely to commit given his proficiency.
