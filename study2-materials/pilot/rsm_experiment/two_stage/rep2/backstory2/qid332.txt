### **Teacher’s Prediction**

**Predicted Choice for Leo: B (Only Katie)**

**Why?**
Leo’s "logic puzzle" mindset and geometric strength mean he tends to look for a "big move" to simplify a structure rather than following boring, step-by-step algorithms. Because he views the equation as a whole object, he will likely be tempted to "get rid of the fraction" immediately by multiplying everything by 3. 

However, this is where his classic weakness—**algebraic manipulation and lack of full simplification**—will catch him out. When multiplying by 3, Leo is highly likely to multiply the $\frac{x}{3}$ and the $12$ correctly but "lose track" of the $-5$, failing to distribute the multiplication across all terms. In his mind, $x - 5 = 36$ looks like a sophisticated, elegant shortcut. 

He will see Tom’s correct method ($ \frac{x}{3}=17 $) as "too simple" or "obvious," and in his obsessive "productive struggle" at the edge of the page, he will convince himself that Katie has found a cleverer way to dismantle the equation. He won't skip it; he will sit there until he "proves" Katie right by ignoring the necessary distribution over the constant.

### **Percentage Distribution for Proficient Students like Leo**

Proficient students often fall into the "distributive property trap" when they try to perform operations on an entire equation simultaneously. 

**proficient: A=45% B=35% C=15% D=5%**

*   **A (Correct):** Many will recognise the standard "balance" method (adding 5 first).
*   **B (The Distributive Error):** A significant chunk of students like Leo, who try to skip steps or "clear the denominator" prematurely, will pick this.
*   **C (The "Both" Guess):** Students who think *any* operation can be done in any order without consequences.
*   **D (The Over-thinker):** A small minority who find a way to argue that even Tom's correct step is "wrong" based on a misunderstanding of "next line."
