Leo is highly likely to choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo's visual-geometric mind treats this as a logic puzzle. He will immediately spot that the denominators are "almost" the same and will attempt to find a common ground. His "productive struggle" will lead him to draw out blocks or lines to represent the fractions. He will correctly identify that $\frac{4}{x}$ needs to be converted to something over $2x$. 

However, his tendency to trip up on algebraic manipulation is his downfall here. He will correctly double the denominator to get $2x$, and he will correctly double the numerator to get $8$. He then performs the addition $3 + 8 = 11$. Because he sees the answer $\frac{11}{2x}$ (Option A) as the result of a multi-step logical process, he will feel a sense of triumph and circle it, likely ignoring the "simpler" looking distractors.

Option D is the "trap" for students who don't understand common denominators (simply adding the numerators), but Leo is too sharp for that. Option B is a classic "add the tops, add the bottoms" error, which Leo's geometric intuition would reject. Option C represents a failure to keep track of the denominator after doubling.
