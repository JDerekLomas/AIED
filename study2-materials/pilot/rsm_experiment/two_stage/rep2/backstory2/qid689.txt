Having taught many students like Leo, I can picture his exam paper exactly. 

**Leo's Predicted Choice: A (p = 0.5)**

**The "Why":**
Leo’s sharp logical mind will immediately recognize that since 10 is larger than 5, $p$ must be a number that "grows" the 5 or relates to the 0.5/2/50 family. However, his weakness in algebraic manipulation is his undoing here. He will likely attempt to "move" the $p$ or the 10 using a half-remembered rule. 

Because he views this as a puzzle, he'll likely try to balance the equation visually. He might perform $10 \div 5 = 2$ and then, realizing $5 \div 2$ is $2.5$ (which doesn't fit), he’ll "reverse" his logic and try $5 \div 10$. He will arrive at $0.5$ and find it "satisfying" because $5$ is half of $10$. His "productive struggle" will involve him drawing out a bar model or a number line in the margin, but because he struggles with the abstract nature of $p$ in the denominator, he will likely convince himself that $0.5$ "fits" the symmetry of the numbers $5$ and $10$. He will avoid **C** because his intuition tells him that dividing 5 by 2 makes it smaller, not 10, but in his frustration and "scribbling," he’ll likely flip the operation and land firmly on **A**.

**Percentage Predictions:**
For "Proficient" students who are strong geometrically but weak algebraically:
* **A (0.5):** The most common "logic error." They understand the relationship between 5 and 10 is a factor of 2, but perform $5 \div 10$ instead of $10 \div 5$ or vice-versa without correctly isolating $p$.
* **B (50):** The "operation error." These students see 10 and 5 and instinctively multiply them because they think they need to "undo" a division, neglecting the position of the variable.
* **C (2):** The "impulse error." They see 10 and 5 and think "10 divided by 5 is 2."
* **D (No solutions):** Rare for this ability level, usually only chosen if they over-complicate the "puzzle" aspect to the point of exhaustion.
