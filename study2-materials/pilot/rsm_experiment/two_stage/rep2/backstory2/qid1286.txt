Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B**.

**Reasoning:** 
Leo’s geometric intuition tells him exactly what formula to use ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$), and his "logic puzzle" mindset will drive him to rearrange it from scratch rather than recalling a rearranged version. However, his tendency to trip up on algebraic manipulation is his "Achilles' heel." 

When multiplying both sides by 3 to get $3V = 4\pi r^3$, he will likely see the 4 and the $\pi$ as a single unit to be moved. In the "productive struggle" of his scribbled margin notes, Leo often rushes the final step of division. He is prone to a "top-heavy" error where he inadvertently keeps the 4 in the numerator because it was "on top" of the fraction in the original formula, or he simply mismatches the coefficients during his chaotic trial-and-error process. Option B looks "right" to a student who understands the components but loses track of the inverse operations mid-flow. He will likely dismiss C because he might think he has made a mistake in flipping the fraction, and he will dismiss D because his spatial reasoning tells him the cube root must encompass the $\pi$.
