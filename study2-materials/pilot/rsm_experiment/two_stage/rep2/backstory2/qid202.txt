Having taught Leo for a while now, I can picture exactly how he’d approach this. On the surface, it’s a simple "add the integers, add the fractions" task, but Leo rarely takes the path of least resistance. 

Because he views maths as a logic puzzle and dislikes repetitive arithmetic, he is likely to over-engineer the solution to make it "more interesting." Instead of simply seeing $2+1$ and $\frac{1}{5}+\frac{2}{5}$, he will likely convert both to improper fractions immediately ($\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5}$) to ensure he isn't "missing a trick." 

While he will easily reach $\frac{18}{5}$, his known weakness in "finishing" algebraic or multi-step arithmetic problems comes into play here. He often gets so caught up in the process (the "productive struggle") that he forgets to re-read the final constraint of the prompt. Since the question asks for a mixed number, and Option B is the improper equivalent he just calculated, there is a high probability he will circle B in a moment of triumph, feeling he has "cracked the code," and fail to perform the final simplification back to $3 \frac{3}{5}$.

However, there is also the "Leo Chaos Factor": because he over-visualises, he might occasionally treat the denominators like vectors or geometric segments, leading him to erroneously add them (giving him a denominator of 10).

**Predicted choice for Leo:** **B** (He’ll do the hard work of converting to $\frac{18}{5}$, then stop because he’s satisfied he solved the "puzzle" and overlook the "mixed number" instruction).
