Leo is a "visualiser" who excels at geometric logic but struggles with the abstract "grammar" of algebra. Because he views maths as a series of puzzles, he is likely to see the numbers 3 and 12 and immediately seek a "satisfying" numerical relationship between them.

For Leo, the most seductive trap is Option A. His intuition will likely leap to the fact that $12 \div 3 = 4$. Because he often trips up on the formal manipulation of fractions (failing to treat the division by 3 as a multiplication by $\frac{1}{3}$), he is likely to perform a "shortcut" in his head. He might subconsciously move the 3 to the denominator but mentally process it as "reducing" the 12 rather than multiplying it. His "productive struggle" might involve him drawing a bar model of 12 parts and trying to divide it, but his algebraic weakness with reciprocal operations will likely lead him to believe that "3 parts of something being 1/12 means 1 part must be 1/4" (erroneously enlarging the fraction instead of shrinking it).

However, because he is "proficient" and sharp, there is a chance he will catch himself and correctly multiply the denominators, but his history of losing track of signs and simple operations suggests he is highly susceptible to the "looks right" lure of $p = 1/4$.
