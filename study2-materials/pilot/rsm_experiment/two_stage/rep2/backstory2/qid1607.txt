Having taught Leo for some time, I can picture his approach to this. He will immediately see the "puzzle" of Step 1: he’ll mentally visualise the balance scale or the "undoing" of the division by 4. His geometric intuition helps him see that multiplying both sides by 4 is the logical first move. He will quickly confirm $15 \times 4 = 60$ and conclude Step 1 is correct.

However, Step 2 is where his classic "algebraic trip-up" will occur. Leo tends to rush through manipulation once the initial logic is solved. He will see the numbers $60, 1,$ and $k$ and, instead of carefully subtracting $1$ from both sides, his brain will "glue" the numbers together ($60+1=61$). Because he values the "flow" of the logic over the sign notation, he will likely overlook the inverse operation required. He won't skip it; he’ll likely scribble a few quick diagrams of "blocks" in the margin, convince himself $61$ feels right in the sequence, and move on.

He will choose **Option A**.
