Lila will almost certainly choose **Option C ( = )**.

As her teacher, I’ve seen Lila do this many times. Because she is "artistically-minded," she has a strong subconscious bias toward visual symmetry and balance. She will look at this expression and see the same four numbers (8, 12, 4, 8) and the same three numbers (12, 4) in the same order on both sides. To Lila, the parentheses look like a formatting choice or a "framing" device rather than an operator that changes the fundamental value of the numbers.

She is "proficient," so she knows BODMAS exists, but when she hits that "numerical wall," she will sketch out a quick diagram—likely two bars of equal length divided into sections—to convince herself that "the total amount of numbers being divided is the same." She will ignore the order of operations in favor of the visual "fairness" of the equation.

Here is the predicted distribution for proficient students with Lila's specific profile (strong visual bias, algebraic impatience):

proficient: A=12% B=8% C=75% D=5%
