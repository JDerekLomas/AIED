Lila will almost certainly choose **Option B**.

As a proficient student who thinks visually and artistically, Lila will correctly identify the operation needed ($y = 3 \times 0.3^2$) but her reliance on "visual scaffolding" will lead her into a common decimal trap. She will likely square the 3 in her head or on the side of her page, see the "3" and "3" and "3" as a repeating pattern, and conclude that $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.9$. When she then multiplies $3 \times 0.9$, she arrives at $2.7$. 

However, because she struggles with multi-step numerical processing and frequently second-guesses "purely numerical" results, she is likely to over-adjust the decimal point. She knows $0.3^2$ should result in a "smaller-looking" decimal, and her "incorrect scaffolding" will likely involve a sketch of a grid where she miscounts the place value. She will see $0.27$ as more "proportionally correct" for a small number like $0.3$ than $2.7$, leading her to B. Alternatively, she may perform $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ first (ignoring BIDMAS/BODMAS) and then attempt to square $0.9$, getting lost in the decimals.
