Lila Thorne will most likely choose **Option C (5)**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila's distaste for "pure" algebra means she avoids formal rearrangement. Instead of isolating $y$ or substituting $x=0$ and solving the resulting equation $2y=10$, she will look for a visual shortcut. She will likely focus on the $y$ row and the total "10" in the equation. In her mind, the $x=0$ column effectively "deletes" the $4x$ term visually. Seeing $2y=10$, her intuition will jump to a basic division $(10 \div 2)$ because it feels like a symmetry or a balance point in her sketchpad-style scaffolding.

However, there is a strong possibility she might get distracted by the $4x$ coefficient even if it's multiplied by zero, or attempt to "visualize" a linear drop from the 10. But for a student who excels at geometry, the simplicity of $2y=10$ when $x$ is "nothing" is the path of least resistance. She chooses C because it "looks" right within the structure of the equation's constants.

**Distribution Prediction:**
For proficient students who struggle with the "multi-step" nature of negative numbers and formal algebraic manipulation:

below_basic: A=XX% B=XX% C=XX% D=XX%
basic: A=XX% B=XX% C=XX% D=XX%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=65% D=10%
advanced: A=XX% B=XX% C=XX% D=XX%
