Lila will almost certainly choose **A (Only Tom)**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s strength is in visual logic and patterns. When looking at the equation, Tom’s method follows a clean, linear step that mirrors the physical "moving" of a constant from one side to the other—a visual shift she can easily conceptualize in her head (the -5 becoming a +5). 

However, Katie’s step is her "wall." Because Lila struggles with multi-step algebraic rules, she is likely to fall for the common misconception that she can "undo" the division of $x$ by 3 by multiplying the $12$ by $3$, without distributing that multiplication to the $-5$. In her mind, the "$-5$" is a separate entity that shouldn't be affected by the 3 until later. She will perceive Tom’s step as "right" because it feels organized, and Katie’s step as "wrong" because it looks like a "messy" shortcut that breaks the visual isolation of the $x/3$ term. Her margin drawings would likely show a scale balance where she adds 5 units to both sides, confirming Tom's logic while rejecting Katie's.
