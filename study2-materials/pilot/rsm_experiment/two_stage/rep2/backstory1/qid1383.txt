Lila will most likely choose **Option C: -81**.

**Why:**
Lila’s visual-geometric brain will immediately "see" the structure of the calculation as $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$ and correctly arrive at 81. However, because she views algebra as a foreign language and struggles with negative numbers in multi-step equations, she is prone to a common conceptual trap. Instead of applying the power to the negative sign, she will likely treat the negative as a separate "layer" of the problem—visualising it as a "negative version of the calculation." 

When she hits her usual "wall" with the negative exponent rule, she will probably draw a series of four squares or a branching pattern to confirm the number 81, but then "tack on" the negative sign at the end because her mental model for powers of negatives is shaky. She chooses C over A because, in her visual logic, if the input is negative, the "picture" remains in the negative zone.
