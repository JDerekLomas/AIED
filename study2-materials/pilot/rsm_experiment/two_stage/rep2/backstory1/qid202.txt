Lila will choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
As a proficient student with a flair for visual patterns, Lila will likely treat this as a "grouping" exercise rather than an algebraic hurdle. She will sketch out circular representations (the "scaffolding" diagrams mentioned) of the whole numbers and the fractions. Because the denominators are the same, she will immediately see that two wholes and one whole make three, and the remaining shaded segments (one-fifth and two-fifths) combine perfectly within a single five-segment grid. 

She is unlikely to choose B (improper fraction) because she follows instructions well and the question asks for a mixed number. She is too proficient to choose D; she understands that adding two parts of a "fifth" chocolate bar doesn't suddenly turn the bar into a "tenth" (a common error for basic-level students). She will see the logic of the segments remaining the same size.

**Predicted Percentages:**
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=10% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
