Lila Thorne is most likely to choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s primary struggle is with the "messiness" of algebraic structure and negative numbers, but she has a strong visual-logical grasp of patterns. When looking at this set of numbers, her artistic brain will immediately seek to simplify or "clean up" the data. She is likely to view the number $0$ as a literal "nothing"—a blank space on her page. 

Because she tries to force visual solutions, she will mentally (or physically in her margins) group the non-zero numbers into a shape or a cluster. To Lila, a "mean" is about sharing out the "stuff," and since $0$ contributes no value to the sum, she will see the four non-zero digits as the only active participants in the calculation. However, unlike a lower-ability student who might choose Option C ($ \div 4$), Lila is **proficient** enough to remember the "rule" that you must divide by the total number of items in the list. She will likely experience a moment of cognitive dissonance: "The 0 doesn't add anything, so I don't need to write it on top, but there are definitely five numbers in the row." Option A provides the "cleanest" visual representation that satisfies her rule-following without cluttering her sum with what she perceives as a redundant digit.
