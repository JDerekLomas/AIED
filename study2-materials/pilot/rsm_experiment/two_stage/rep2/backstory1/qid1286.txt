Lila will most likely choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila is a visual thinker who relies on "scaffolding" when algebra becomes abstract. Her proficiency in geometry means she likely remembers the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, but her struggle with multi-step algebraic manipulation is her undoing here. When she attempts to "move" the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ to the other side of the equation, she is prone to a classic "visual" error: she will likely try to keep the numbers in their familiar orientation (4 on top, 3 on bottom) rather than performing the reciprocal operation. 

She will look at the formula and see "4 on top, 3 on bottom" and expect to see that same vertical arrangement in the answer. Option A preserves the $4/3$ structure, whereas Option C requires the conceptual leap of multiplying by the reciprocal. Lila’s "incorrect scaffolding diagrams" would likely involve trying to draw the sphere being "divided" by its components, leading her to group the $4$ and $\pi$ together with the $V$ as they appear in the numerator of the standard formula.
