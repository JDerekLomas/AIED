Lila Thorne will most likely choose **Option D**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s artistic and visual nature leads her to look for immediate patterns in the symbols. While she is proficient, her tendency to "force a visual solution" means she will likely treat the fraction components as discrete units to be combined rather than applying the necessary algebraic steps (finding a common denominator). She is likely to look at the numerators (3 and 4) and add them to get 7, then look at the denominators ($2x$ and $x$) and be seduced by the presence of $2x$ as the more "complete" or dominant visual structure, simply placing the 7 over the $2x$. Her aversion to multi-step algebraic "interference" means she will likely bypass the step of multiplying $4/x$ by $2/2$, seeing the $x$ and $2x$ as related enough to just pick the larger denominator without changing the numerator. She might even draw a bar model where she adds three slices and four slices, neglecting the fact that the "slices" are different sizes.
