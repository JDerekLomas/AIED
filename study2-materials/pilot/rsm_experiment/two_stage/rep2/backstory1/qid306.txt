Lila Thorne is likely to choose **Option D**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s visual-pattern-seeking brain often betrays her when dealing with BODMAS/BIDMAS. In Problem Q, she will correctly identify the hierarchy of multiplication over addition, leading her to "5 × 6". However, in Problem P, her reliance on a rigid interpretation of "A" (Addition) before "S" (Subtraction) in the BIDMAS acronym will lead her astray. Because she views maths through a structural lens rather than a fluid numerical one, she will likely see "5 + 6" as a visual unit that must be resolved first because "Addition comes first in the name." She is prone to the common misconception that addition must *always* precede subtraction, regardless of left-to-right order, and will likely sketch a number line or a grouping diagram in her margin to "prove" why the 5 and 6 belong together.
