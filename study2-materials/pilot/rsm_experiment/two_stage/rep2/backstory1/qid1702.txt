Lila will likely choose **Option C (3.3)**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila will substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation to get $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, resulting in $10x - 3 = 30$. Here, her "negative number" weakness and her desire to see a visual "balance" will trip her up. Instead of performing the inverse operation (adding 3), she is highly likely to perceive the $-3$ as something that must be "removed" from the total, or she will make a sign error when moving it across the equals sign, calculating $10x = 30 - 3 = 27$. 

Given her stubborn reliance on visual scaffolding, she might draw a bar model or a number line that incorrectly represents the subtraction, leading her to $x = 2.7$ (Option D). However, Lila is proficient; she knows that "10x" means shifting a decimal point. She is most likely to correctly reach $10x = 33$ but then second-guess the addition of a negative, or more likely, she will perform $30 + 3 = 33$ and correctly divide by 10 to get 3.3. Option C feels "right" to a student who over-complicates the algebraic process but stays visually grounded.
