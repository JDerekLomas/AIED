Lila will most likely choose **Option C**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s "artistic" approach to maths means she prioritises the visual order of elements on the page rather than the underlying operations. When she looks at $c \div (h+4)$, her brain is looking for a visual structure she can "sketch." She likely views the $h+4$ as a secondary unit and focuses on the $c$ and $h$ first. 

Because she struggles with multi-step algebra and negative numbers, she often tries to simplify the visual field. Option C ($ \frac{c}{h}+4 $) appeals to her because it maintains a linear, horizontal progression that mirrors her drawing process—handling the division first and then "adding on" the rest, rather than embracing the vertical "all-in-one" structure of the correct fraction in Option A. She likely views the brackets in the original question as an invitation to separate the terms, rather than a instruction to group them under the division bar. Option D is her second most likely mistake, as she may get "tripped up" and invert the fraction purely because it looks more "balanced" to have the heavier term on top.
