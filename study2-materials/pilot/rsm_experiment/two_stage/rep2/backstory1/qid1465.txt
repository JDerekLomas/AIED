Lila Thorne will most likely choose **Option B (4)**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s approach is governed by her need to find a visual "flow" or pattern in the numbers. She will correctly identify the multiplication first ($4 \times 2 = 8$) because the multiplication symbol acts as a visual anchor in the middle of the expression. However, her specific weakness with multi-step negative number calculations will trip her up at the next stage. 

Instead of reading the expression as $3 - 5 + 8$, she is highly likely to look at the numbers $3$ and $5$ and visually group them, focusing on the subtraction operator. If she perceives the "scaffolding" of the problem as a sequence of discrete blocks, she might perform $3 - 5$ to get $-2$, but then struggle with the addition of the positive 8. More characteristically for Lila, she may try to "balance" the equation visually: she might subtract the 5 from the 8 first (leaving 3) and then add the remaining 3 and 1 together, or make a sign error when bridging zero. However, the most common pitfall for a student of her profile is a "left-to-right" visual sweep after the multiplication: $3 - 5 = -2$, and then $-2 + 8$. Given her stubbornness with numerical rules vs. visual intuition, she is likely to miscalculate the gap between $-2$ and $8$, or conflate the signs and arrive at $4$ (essentially doing $5+8=13$ then $13-3$ incorrectly, or $8-5+3$ but losing a sign). Option B represents the "scaffolded" error most common in proficient students who handle the Order of Operations but fail the integer arithmetic.
