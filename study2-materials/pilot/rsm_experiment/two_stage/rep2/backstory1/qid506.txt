Lila Thorne will most likely choose **Option A ($p=\frac{1}{4}$)**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila's "proficient" level means she recognizes she needs to isolate $p$, but her habit of forcing visual solutions onto numerical problems will lead her astray here. Looking at $3p = \frac{1}{12}$, she will likely ignore the algebraic process of dividing by 3 and instead look for a visual or geometric relationship between the numbers 3 and 12. She knows $3 \times 4 = 12$, and in her sketchbook-style mental logic, the fraction $\frac{1}{4}$ feels like a "matching" visual segment of that relationship. She will likely draw a circle or a bar, divide it into 12, group them into threes, and arrive at "4" or "$\frac{1}{4}$" through visual association rather than the formal operation of $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$. Option B requires a nested multiplication ($\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$) which is difficult to "sketch" accurately without strong algebraic scaffolding, so she will dismiss it in favour of the more visually "neat" $\frac{1}{4}$.
