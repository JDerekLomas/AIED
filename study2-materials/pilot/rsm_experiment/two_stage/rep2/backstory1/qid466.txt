Lila Thorne will most likely choose **Option B (-4/3)**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s approach to maths is dictated by her visual and pattern-seeking brain. When she looks at \(-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1\), she will likely "sketch" out a rectangle or a circle in her mind (or margin) divided into quarters. She understands the concept of "reciprocals" visually—she knows that four thirds make a whole. However, her "stubbornness" with negatives is her Achilles' heel. She will see the negative sign on the left and the negative sign on the right and, rather than applying the algebraic rule that a "negative times a positive equals a negative," she will try to "balance" the visual weight of the equation. In her mind, if the start is negative and the end is negative, the bit in the middle "must be negative too" to maintain the pattern. She will likely over-scaffold the diagram, convince herself the signs must match, and fall into the classic sign-error trap.
