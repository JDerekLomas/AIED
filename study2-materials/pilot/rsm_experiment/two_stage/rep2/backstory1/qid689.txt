Lila will almost certainly choose **A ($p=0.5$)**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s "artistic" approach to maths means she looks for symmetry and visual balance in an equation. When faced with $10 = 5/p$, she will immediately identify the relationship between 5 and 10 as a "doubling" or "halving" pattern. Because she struggles with multi-step algebraic manipulation (the process of multiplying by $p$ then dividing by 10), she will instead try to "visualise" the division.

In her margin, she likely sketches a bar or a circle. She will see that 10 is "bigger" than 5, so she will assume $p$ must be a fraction or a decimal to "shrink" the space. Her logic will follow a common visual misconception: "I have 5, and I need to fit 10 into it, so I must be splitting each unit in half." This leads her directly to 0.5. Option C (2) will feel "wrong" to her because she knows $10 \div 5 = 2$, and her brain will tell her this problem is the "inverse" of that, without performing the formal steps to see that $p$ is the divisor.
