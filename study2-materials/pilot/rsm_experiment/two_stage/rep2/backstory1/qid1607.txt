Lila will almost certainly choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:** 
Lila’s visual-geometric mind will instantly recognise Step 1 as a "balance" or a scaling of the denominator; she can visualise the four pieces of a whole becoming sixty. However, her specific weakness with negative numbers and multi-step algebraic manipulation usually manifests as a "sign error" or a misuse of inverse operations. 

When she gets to Step 2, she will see the $+1$ and, rather than logically subtracting it, she will likely "group" it with the 60 to make 61. In her margin, she might even draw a bar model where she incorrectly adds a unit to the total length instead of removing it to isolate $k$. Because she values the visual logic of the first step but knows her own tendency to get "tripped up" by the arithmetic in the second, she will trust her intuition that Step 2 "feels" wrong, but she won't be able to articulate why, ultimately concluding that only the first move was sound.
