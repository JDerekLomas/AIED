Lila Thorne will most likely choose **Option B**, though her journey to get there will be unnecessarily visual.

**Why she would choose this option:**
Lila will instinctively avoid converting to improper fractions immediately because she dislikes "large, ugly numbers" that don't look symmetrical. Instead, she will partition the whole numbers ($2 + 2 = 4$) and then draw two rectangular "chocolate bar" diagrams in her margin to visualize $\frac{7}{10}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$. 

She will hit a brief wall trying to "see" the common denominator, likely sketching a 20-segment grid to make the pieces fit. Once she visually confirms that $14/20$ and $5/20$ fill up the grid, she will arrive at $19/20$. She will choose **B** because it matches her partitioned "4" and her visual sum. She will avoid **A** and **C** because they are improper fractions, which she finds aesthetically unappealing and "maths-heavy," and she is skilled enough in geometry/patterns to recognize that **D** (adding denominators) "looks wrong" proportionally.
