Lila will most likely choose **Option D: $m^2 - 12m - 35$.**

**Reasoning:**
Lila is an artistic thinker who relies on visual structures like the "grid method" or FOIL arrows. While she will correctly identify the $m^2$ and the $12m$ (summing 5 and 7), she consistently struggles with the rules of negative numbers in non-geometric contexts. To her, "negative five and negative seven" suggests a negative result, and she often carries that "negativity" through to the final term. Her "scaffolding" diagram will likely show a $5 \times 7$ area, but because the signs in the brackets are both minus, she will intuitively feel the final product should also be minus, viewing "negative times a negative equals a positive" as an abstract rule that contradicts her visual intuition of "taking away."
