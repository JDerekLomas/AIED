Lila will almost certainly choose **Option D (-5)**.

As her teacher, I have seen Lila do this many times. When faced with negative numbers in an algebraic context, she treats the numbers as physical objects rather than abstract values. Instead of applying the multiplication rule (negative $\times$ negative = positive), Lila will likely sketch a visual number line or a series of "points" in her margin. She will see the $-1$ and the $-4$ and "combine" them visually to reach $-5$, essentially performing an addition of two negative quantities rather than the required multiplication. Her brain prioritizes the visual "size" and "direction" of the numbers over the operational rules of expansion. She might also consider Option C if she ignores the signs, but given her tendency to get "tripped up" by the negatives specifically, she will likely hold onto the negative sign.
