Lila will choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
As a proficient student with a strong visual-geometric mind, Lila will likely approach this by drawing partial "pizza" diagrams or bar models in her margins. She will intuitively see two whole bars and one whole bar making three, and the shaded fifths combining to make three-fifths. Since there are no negative numbers to trip her up and the denominators are common, her visual scaffolding will actually serve her well here. She will avoid the improper fraction (Option B) because she finds the "mixed number" visual more elegant and the question explicitly requests it. She is unlikely to make the common error of adding denominators (Option D) because she can "see" the size of the fifths staying constant in her sketches.
