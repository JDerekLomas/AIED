Lila Thorne is likely to choose **Option D**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s approach to maths is dictated by visual patterns and a desire for "logical flow" that fits her artistic intuition. In Problem Q, she knows her order of operations (BIDMAS) well enough to identify that the multiplication (\(5 \times 6\)) should happen first. However, Problem P is where her specific weaknesses collide. 

Because Lila struggles with negative numbers and prefers to "see" the arithmetic, she will likely look at \(4-5+6\) and attempt to avoid the "messy" negative result of \(4-5 = -1\). To her visual brain, \(5+6\) is a solid, positive block of 11. She is highly susceptible to the "Addition before Subtraction" trap in BIDMAS, interpreted literally because "A" comes before "S". She will likely draw a bracket or a bubble around \(5+6\) in her margin, convincing herself that she should simplify the "easy" addition first before tackling the subtraction, leading her directly to Option D.
