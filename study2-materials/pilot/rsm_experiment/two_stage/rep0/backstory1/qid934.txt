Lila will most likely choose **Option C (5)**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s immediate instinct is to avoid the algebraic manipulation required to rearrange the equation $4x + 2y = 10$. She will see the table and the equation as a visual puzzle rather than a process. When $x=0$, her eyes will likely "delete" the $4x$ term visually. This leaves her with $2y = 10$. 

While she struggles with negative numbers and multi-step equations, she is proficient at basic arithmetic patterns. She will quickly deduce that "two of something equals ten," leading her to 5. However, there is a strong possibility she might get distracted by "visual scaffolding." She may try to draw a coordinate grid in her margin and plot a line, or she might misinterpret the $4$ and $2$ as a ratio. Option A (20) is a common "noise" trap for students who multiply all visible digits ($4 \times 5$ or $10 \times 2$), and Option D (2.5) attracts those who perform the wrong division ($10 \div 4$), but for a proficient student like Lila who can see the "geometry" of the equation, the $y$-intercept ($x=0$) is the most intuitive point to solve.
