Lila Thorne will most likely choose **C) Both steps are correct**.

**Why:**
Lila is a visual thinker who lacks confidence in algebraic manipulation, especially when numbers move across an equals sign. In Step 1, she will see the "scaling up" of 15 to 60 as a logical geometric-style progression ($15 \times 4$), which fits her strength in seeing patterns. However, Step 2 is where her "stubborn visual scaffolding" will lead her astray. 

Instead of performing the inverse operation (subtracting 1 from 60), Lila will likely "see" the 1 and the 60 on the same side of a mental boundary and instinctively group them together to make 61. Because she views the equation as a visual puzzle rather than a series of balanced operations, she is prone to "collecting" the digits. She will find the result (61) aesthetically satisfying because it looks like a completed sequence, and her reluctance to double-check numerical steps against algebraic rules will prevent her from spotting the sign error.
