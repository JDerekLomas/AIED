Lila Thorne will most likely choose **Option B**, though she will arrive there via a circuitous and potentially frustrating visual route. 

As an artistically-minded student, Lila will recoil from converting these to improper fractions immediately (which leads to the "large numbers" she dislikes). Instead, she will likely draw three or five circles/rectangles in her margin. She will quickly shade two wholes for each, giving her the '4'. However, when it comes to the fractional parts, she will struggle with the "visual" scale of 7/10 versus 1/4. Her stubbornness with diagrams will lead her to try and find a common "grid" to draw them on. She will eventually realise that 10 and 4 don't "fit" into each other visually, forcing her to find the common denominator of 20. Because she is **proficient**, she will correctly calculate $14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20$ and combine it with her wholes. 

However, a significant number of "Lilas" get distracted by their own scaffolding or lose track of the question's requirements (e.g., leaving it as an improper fraction or making a basic addition error).
