Lila Thorne is most likely to choose **C) \( p=2 \)**.

**Why:**
Lila's "stubborn visual scaffolding" is her downfall here. She will likely look at the numbers 10 and 5 and instinctively draw a bar model or a sharing diagram to "see" the relationship. Because she struggles with multi-step algebraic manipulation (specifically the step of multiplying by the denominator when the unknown is on the bottom), she will revert to the simplest mental operation available: \(10 \div 5\). Her brain will prioritise the "clean" visual symmetry of 10 and 5, leading her to conclude that \(p\) must be 2. She often ignores the structural hierarchy of the fraction line if it doesn't fit her immediate visual pattern, essentially solving for \(p = 10 \div 5\) rather than \(10p = 5\).
