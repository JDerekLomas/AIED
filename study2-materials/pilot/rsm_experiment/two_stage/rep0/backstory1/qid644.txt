Lila will most likely choose **Option D: -5**.

As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen many "Lilas." Because she is proficient in visual geometry but dislikes abstract algebra, she will likely try to "see" the relationship between -1 and -4. Her stubbornness with visual scaffolding will lead her to treat the multiplication as a spatial combination. Rather than applying the abstract rule (negative × negative = positive), she will likely sketch a number line or a visual grid in her margin. She will see "one step back" and "four steps back," leading her to visually conclude they combine to make -5 (effectively adding the terms instead of multiplying). Her aversion to negative number rules often leads her to default to addition because it feels more "tangible."
