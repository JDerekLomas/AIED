Lila Thorne is likely to choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s visual-geometric mindset means she will likely approach this by trying to find a "balanced" structure. She will recognize that the denominators are "almost" the same and will attempt to draw a visual model (perhaps bars or circles) to represent the fractions. In her effort to force a visual commonality, she will correctly identify that she needs to multiply the second fraction by 2 to make the "boxes" match the size of $2x$. 

However, her tendency to "stubbornly force a visual solution" and her known weakness with multi-step numerical processing will lead her to a common "visual" trap: she will successfully double the numerator of the second fraction (making it 8) and add it to the first (3) to get 11, but she might focus so much on the visual alignment of the denominators that she forgets to verify the numerical steps. Option A feels "complete" to a student who prioritizes visual patterns over algebraic rules. She will avoid Options B and D because they feel "too simple"—her "scaffolding" diagrams usually lead her to believe the answer must be more complex than just adding the numerators (3+4).
