Lila Thorne is most likely to choose **A) \( p=\frac{1}{4} \)**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s artistic brain instinctively looks for numerical "symmetry" and familiar relationships within shapes and patterns. When she sees the numbers 3 and 12, her brain immediately jumps to the fact that $12 \div 3 = 4$. Because she struggles with multi-step algebraic rigour, she is likely to misinterpret the division. Instead of performing the balanced operation ($ \frac{1}{12} \div 3 $), she will likely try to "simplify" the visual relationship between the 3 and the 12. She might even sketch a circle divided into quarters and try to map the 3 onto it, leading her to believe that $p$ must be $\frac{1}{4}$ to "fit" the 12. Option B requires a step into abstract multiplication of fractions ($ \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} $), which is exactly where Lila’s "scaffolding" diagrams usually lead her astray.
