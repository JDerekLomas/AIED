Lila will likely choose **Option C (3.3)**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila will instinctively avoid the "pure" algebraic rearrangement needed to solve $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$. Instead, she will try to "see" the relationship. When she hits the wall of negative numbers (the $-6y$ term), she is likely to ignore the negative sign or mishandle the subtraction, viewing it as a barrier to the "pattern" she is trying to draw.

Most significantly, Lila’s habit of drawing "scaffolding" diagrams often leads her to a "Number Bond" or "Part-Whole" visual strategy. She will calculate $6 \times 0.5 = 3$. From there, her brain will seek the most aesthetically "balanced" relationship between the remaining numbers: 30, 10, and 3. She is highly likely to perform $30 + 3 = 33$ and then divide by 10 to get **3.3**. This avoids the "messy" step of correctly handling the subtraction across the equals sign, which she finds unintuitive compared to the clean symmetry of $3.3 \times 10 = 33$.

Option D is a "trap" for those who correctly subtract 3 but struggle with the negative sign; however, Lila’s artistic bias toward additive patterns usually pushes her toward the larger, "complete" looking number.
