Lila Thorne will most likely choose **Option B**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila is a "visual-first" student who tries to force patterns onto numerical problems. Her proficiency in geometry means she understands the concept of squaring, but her habit of "scaffolding" will lead her to look for a shortcut. 

She will likely calculate $0.3^2$. In her mind's eye, she sees $3 \times 3 = 9$, and because there is one decimal place, she might correctly arrive at $0.09$ or, more likely for an "artistically-minded" student rushing the arithmetic, incorrectly place the decimal to get $0.9$. However, the "trap" Lila falls into is her desire for the numbers to look "right" aesthetically. She sees the numbers $3$ (from the equation) and $9$ (from the square) and instinctively performs $3 \times 9 = 27$. Seeing "27" in option B provides that "eureka" moment where the pattern seems to fit, ignoring the precise placement of the decimal point. She will choose B because $0.27$ feels like a "proportional" transformation of the starting numbers.

A student like Lila often misses Option D ($2.7$) because she over-complicates the decimal shifting in her margin diagrams, often "shrinking" the number further because $0.3$ is "small."

**Percentage Predictions:**
proficient: A=10% B=55% C=15% D=20%
