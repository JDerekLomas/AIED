Lila will most likely choose **Option C (-81)**.

**Reasoning:** 
Lila’s visual-geometric brain will immediately recognise that $3^4 = 81$, as she is proficient with numerical patterns. However, her specific weakness with negative numbers in multi-step algebra will trip her up here. Rather than applying the algebraic rule that an even power result in a positive value, she will attempt to "visualise" the negative sign. In her margins, she is likely to draw a number line or a series of four "negative" blocks. Because she sees four negative signs, her intuition might suggest a cumulative "negative effect" or she may simply perform the calculation $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$ and then "reattach" the negative sign she sees in the question, assuming the negative is an external property rather than part of the base being squared then squared again.
