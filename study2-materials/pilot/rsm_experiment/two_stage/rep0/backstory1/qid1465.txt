Lila Thorne will most likely choose **Option B**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s approach to maths is dictated by her desire to "visualise" the logic. When faced with \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\), she will correctly identify the priority of the multiplication (\(4 \times 2 = 8\)) due to her proficient understanding of rules. However, she will then hit her "algebraic wall" with the negative numbers. 

Because she refuses to guess and insists on "forcing" a visual solution, she will likely sketch a number line or a series of marks in her margin. She is highly prone to the common "Addition before Subtraction" misconception (the 'AS' in BIDMAS/BODMAS), treating the calculation as \(3 - (5+8)\). She will see the \(5\) and \(8\) as a block of \(13\), and then struggle to reconcile the \(3 - 13\). Given her distaste for negatives and her tendency to over-complicate visual scaffolding, she often ends up reversing the subtraction to find a "cleaner" number, or miscounting her own diagrams to arrive at \(4\) (perhaps viewing it as a distance between points on a poorly scaled visual line). Option B represents the most common "scaffolded" error for students who perform the addition component of BIDMAS first and then get lost in the signage.

**Predicted Percentages:**
proficient: A=45% B=35% C=12% D=8%

*(Note: Option A is the correct answer. Option B is the result of the "Addition before Subtraction" error. Option C and D represent errors in order of operations or sign handling that students of Lila’s "proficient" level usually avoid, though they still catch a small percentage of those who over-visualise and lose the thread of the calculation.)*
