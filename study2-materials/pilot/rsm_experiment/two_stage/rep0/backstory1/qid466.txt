Lila Thorne will most likely choose **Option B: $-\frac{4}{3}$**.

**The "Why":**
Lila is proficient with geometry, meaning she understands the "flipping" relationship of reciprocals, which leads her to correctly identify that she needs a $\frac{4}{3}$ to turn a $\frac{3}{4}$ into a $1$. However, her specific weakness with multi-step algebraic equations and negative numbers is her undoing here. 

Lila will likely draw a visual "balance" diagram in her margin. She will see the minus sign on the left and the minus sign on the right and conclude that they "match" or "balance" each other out already. To her visual brain, adding another negative sign feels like it would disrupt that symmetry or "over-complicate" the look of the equation. She often forgets the rule that "a negative times a negative is a positive," instead treating the negative sign as a fixed attribute of the side of the equation. She chooses B because it provides the numerical reciprocal she knows she needs while retaining the "look" of the negative signs she sees in the prompt.
