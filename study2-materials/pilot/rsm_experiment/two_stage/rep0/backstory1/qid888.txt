Lila Thorne is most likely to choose **Option D**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila will instinctively reach for a visual method, likely drawing a 2x2 grid (the "box method") to expand the brackets. She will correctly identify the $m^2$ and the $-5m$ and $-7m$ terms, as she is proficient with the visual logic of the grid. Her struggle with multi-step algebra and negative numbers will occur at the final step. 

When multiplying $-5$ by $-7$, Lila often overlooks the "double negative" rule in favor of what "looks" right. To her, a problem dominated by subtraction signs (m-5 and m-7) suggests a "negative" outcome. She will likely write $-35$ in the final cell of her grid. When she combines the middle terms, she will correctly get $-12m$, but her "stubborn visual scaffolding" will lead her to choose the option that maintains the negative aesthetic she has established on her page.
