Lila will most likely choose **Option C (=)**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s primary hurdle is her reliance on visual "patterns" and her tendency to avoid the rigour of multi-step algebraic operations. She is likely to look at the numbers and symbols as a symmetrical visual arrangement rather than a set of operations dictated by BIDMAS (order of operations). 

Because the expression contains the same digits ($8, 12, 4$) in the same sequence on both sides, her artistic brain will likely perceive a "balance" or a "reflection." She will see the brackets on the right as a stylistic grouping rather than a functional instruction that changes the value. Instead of calculating $8+3=11$ versus $20 \div 4 = 5$, she will likely sketch a quick "flow" diagram in her margin, convince herself the components are identical, and conclude that the values must be equal.
