Lila Thorne will most likely choose **Option C**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s artistic brain searches for visual symmetry and patterns rather than underlying algebraic logic. In Option A, the horizontal fraction bar "traps" the $h+4$ together, which Lila often finds visually claustrophobic. She frequently struggles with negative numbers and multi-step operations because she tends to handle one component at a time. To her, Option C looks like a "cleaner" translation: she sees the $c \div h$ as one block and the $+4$ as a separate tail-end piece, mirroring how she might sketch a sequence of transformations. She is likely to "break" the denominator to keep the $+4$ as a distinct visual element, failing to recognize the bracketed $(h+4)$ as a single protected unit. She might also consider Option D if she over-complicates the "visual flip" of the fraction, but C is the classic error for a visual thinker who resists abstract grouping rules.
