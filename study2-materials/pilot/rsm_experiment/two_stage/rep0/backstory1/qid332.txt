Lila will almost certainly choose **A (Only Tom)**. 

Knowing Lila, her artistic brain relies heavily on a "layering" logic. When she looks at Tom’s step, she sees a clear, single movement: the $-5$ moving across to become $+17$. This feels like a "translation" in geometry, which she finds intuitive. However, Katie’s step—multiplying by 3 while leaving the $-5$ untouched—is a classic multi-step algebraic trap. Because Lila avoids abstract algebraic rules and tries to "visualise" the balance, she will likely fail to distribute the multiplication across the whole side of the equation. To Lila, the $-5$ is a separate object she hasn't "touched" yet, so she won't see why it needs to change to $-15$. She will view Katie's suggestion as a "sketch" that doesn't scale correctly, whereas Tom’s step looks like a tidy, logical progression.

Below is the prediction for the performance of proficient students who, like Lila, have a visual/geometric bias but struggle with formal algebraic axioms and negative/multi-step manipulation.

proficient: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%
