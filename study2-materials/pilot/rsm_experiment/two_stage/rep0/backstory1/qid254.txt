Lila Thorne is most likely to choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s visual-geometric intuition actually serves her well here. While she finds abstract algebra a chore, she has a keen eye for "completeness." She will recognize that the zero exists but, as an artistically-minded student who likes efficiency, she will likely see adding the zero as redundant in the numerator (it doesn't change the sum). However, she will stubbornly focus on the *physicality* of the set. She will count the items in the list (0, 1, 3, 4, 7) and see five distinct marks on the page. Therefore, dividing by four (Option C) will feel "wrong" to her visual sense of space. 

She will avoid Option B because she has been stung by order of operations (BIDMAS) in algebra before; her "scaffolding" diagrams usually involve brackets or fraction bars to keep numbers contained, so she will instinctively prefer the visual "box" of the fraction in Option A over the linear string of Option B. She is proficient enough to know that 0 is a data point, but lacks the numerical pedantry to insist on seeing "0+" in the expression.

**Percentage Predictions:**
below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=5%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=15% B=5% C=5% D=75%
