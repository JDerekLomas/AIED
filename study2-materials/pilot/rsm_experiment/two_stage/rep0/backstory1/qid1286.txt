Lila will most likely choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila is a visual thinker who relies on "scaffolding" when she feels overwhelmed by algebra. Because she treats maths like a sketchbook, she often memorises the *look* of a formula rather than its derivation. She knows the volume of a sphere formula contains $4$, $3$, $\pi$, and $r^3$. When she tries to rearrange $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ in her head, her tendency to avoid "purely numerical" algebraic steps (like dividing by a fraction) will lead her astray.

She will likely write out the formula and then attempt to "cluster" the symbols together visually. In her mind, the $4/3$ and the $\pi$ belong together. When she moves them to the other side of the equation to isolate $r$, she is prone to simply "carrying" the entire visual block across without performing the reciprocal operation. Option A looks the most "ordered" to an artistic eye—it keeps the original product of the formula intact under the cube root, whereas Option C (the correct answer) requires a counter-intuitive flipping of the fraction that clashes with her visual memory of the standard formula.
