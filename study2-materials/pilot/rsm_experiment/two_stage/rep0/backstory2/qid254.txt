As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option A**.

**Why?**
Leo views maths through a lens of logic rather than rote procedure. He will immediately recognise that adding $0$ doesn’t change the sum of the numerator, but his "logic puzzle" brain will be scanning for the catch regarding the denominator. Because he is sharp with spatial reasoning and "total" concepts, he will correctly identify that there are five data points. 

However, his tendency to get bogged down in "productive struggle" and his weakness in algebraic notation will lead him to over-analyse Option B. He’ll spot the BIDMAS error in B (that only the 7 is being divided), leading him to dismiss it. While a weaker student might choose C (forgetting the zero), Leo’s proficiency suggests he knows the rules of the mean, but his impatience with "basic" arithmetic means he will likely appreciate the "efficiency" of Option A (omitting the 0 from the sum) and select it confidently as the most mathematically sound representation present. He might spend five minutes in the margin sketching a bar model to prove to himself that the "gap" of the zero still counts as a space.

**Predicted Statistics:**
For students of **proficient** ability who struggle with algebraic precision and over-think simple structures:

proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
