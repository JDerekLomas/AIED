Having taught Leo for some time, I can picture exactly how he would approach this. He will immediately see Step 1 as a logical rearrangement—multiplying both sides by 4 to "clear the fraction" appeals to his sense of spatial structure and logic. He’ll tick that off mentally with confidence.

However, Step 2 is where Leo’s specific algebraic weaknesses will trigger a "productive struggle" loop. To isolate $k$, he needs to subtract 1 from 60. But Leo often treats numbers as movable objects; he might see the $1$ and the $60$ and, in his haste to find the "puzzle piece" that fits, mentally add them instead of performing the inverse operation. Because he refuses to move on, he will likely fill his margin with little sketches or trial-and-error checks (e.g., trying to see if $15 = \frac{1+61}{4}$), but his tendency to lose track of signs or operations mid-calculation means he is highly susceptible to confirming the "61" by mistake or simply over-complicating a simple subtraction.

**Predicted Choice:** **A (Only step 1)**
*Reasoning:* Leo is sharp enough to recognize that Step 1 is correct geometric/logical scaling. However, because he is prone to algebraic slips, he will likely perform the subtraction $60 - 1$ and realize Step 2 is $59$, not $61$. While he might obsessively re-calculate, his "proficient" level means he usually catches these one-step errors if they are isolated, leading him to identify that only the first step holds up.

**Predicted Percentages:**
Students like Leo (proficient but messy with algebra) often fall for the "visual" trap of Step 2 or over-think the simplicity of the error.
