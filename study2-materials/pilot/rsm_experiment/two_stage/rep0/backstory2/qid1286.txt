Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo will immediately recall the volume formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ because of his strength in 3D geometry. He views this as a "logic puzzle" to be solved. However, his weakness in algebraic manipulation will manifest here. 

When rearranging for $r$, he will likely multiply by $V$ correctly but fumble the division. He often struggles with "nested" fractions or terms on the denominator. In his "productive struggle," he will likely scribble several iterations of $V = \dots$ and, in his haste to isolate $r$, he is prone to flipping the $\frac{3}{4}$ correctly but leaving the $\pi$ on the top or misplacing it during the transition to the cube root. Option B is a classic "near-miss" for a student who understands the concept but loses track of the denominator's components—a common trait for Leo who "trips up" on the fine details of manipulation.

The messy diagrams in his margin will show various attempts to move the $4$, $3$, and $\pi$ around the equals sign, and he is likely to settle on B because it *looks* algebraically sophisticated enough to satisfy his logic, even if his manual steps were flawed.
