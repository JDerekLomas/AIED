Having taught Leo for some time, I can predict that while this question appears simple for a Year 9 student of his ability, he is highly likely to overcomplicate it. 

Leo will see "fractions" and immediately bypass the intuitive addition of whole numbers ($2 + 1$) and parts ($\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}$). Instead, his tendency toward "productive struggle" and his love for complex systems will lead him to convert both to improper fractions immediately: $\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5}$. 

However, because Leo struggles with algebraic and numerical manipulation—frequently making small procedural slips—there is a high risk he will reach $\frac{18}{5}$ and stop there. Despite the instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number," Leo often becomes so engrossed in the mechanical "logic puzzle" of the calculation that he forgets the final formatting requirement. 

I predict Leo will choose **B**. He will successfully do the "harder" work of improper fraction addition but, in his typical chaotic margin-scribbling fashion, he will view $\frac{18}{5}$ as the "solved" state of the puzzle and fail to convert it back to $3 \frac{3}{5}$.

Here is the predicted distribution for students like Leo (proficient reasoning, but prone to manipulation errors and over-complication):

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=45% B=40% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=8% C=1% D=1%
