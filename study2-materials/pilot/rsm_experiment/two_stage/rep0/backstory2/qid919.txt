As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option A (0.81)**.

**The "Why":**
Leo’s downfall here is his tendency to over-complicate algebraic substitution and his "creative" but sometimes undisciplined approach to arithmetic. Because he views this as a puzzle, he will likely jump straight into the calculation $3 \times 0.3^2$. 

However, Leo often struggles with the order of operations when variables and powers are involved. Given his history of "scribbling multiple complex diagrams," he will likely try to visualize $0.3 \times 0.3$. He might correctly identify $0.09$, but in his obsessive "productive struggle" to make the answer "look right," he is highly likely to accidentally compute $(3 \times 0.3)^2$ instead of $3 \times (0.3^2)$. To Leo, the "logic" of squaring the whole term $(0.9^2 = 0.81)$ feels more like a completed puzzle than the correct, smaller value of $0.27$. He will see $0.81$ as a "stronger" mathematical result and commit to it, refusing to move on until he has justified that path to himself.

**The Statistics:**
For students of proficient ability like Leo—who understand the concept but are prone to specific arithmetic slips and misapplying BIDMAS (Order of Operations) with decimals:

proficient: A=45% B=30% C=10% D=15%
