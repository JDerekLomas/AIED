Leo is highly likely to choose **Option A**.

**Why Leo would choose this option:**
Leo’s "productive struggle" and geometric mindset actually make him quite dangerous when faced with algebraic fractions. Because he treats maths like a logic puzzle, he won't just guess; he will likely identify that he needs a common denominator. He will see the $2x$ and the $x$ and instinctively understand that he needs to scale the second fraction. 

However, his tendency to lose track of details during algebraic manipulation is his undoing. He will correctly identify the common denominator as $2x$, but in his scribbled "map of trial and error" in the margin, he will likely perform the operation $3 + (4 \times 2) = 11$ correctly, then perhaps get momentarily distracted by trying to simplify something that isn't there, or conversely, get the numerator right but forget to simplify the expression further because he's exhausted his mental load on the initial setup. Alternatively, his "logic puzzle" brain might overcomplicate the denominator (thinking he needs to multiply $2x$ by $x$), leading him to a complex fraction which he then tries to "force" back into a simpler form. Option A represents the successful navigation of the common denominator, which fits a student of his proficient reasoning level who occasionally fumbles the final execution.

**Why he might avoid the others:** 
- **B & D:** These involve simply adding the denominators or numerators without scaling, which Leo’s geometric logic usually flags as "wrong" (he knows parts of a whole don't work that way). 
- **C:** He is unlikely to miss the denominator entirely, as he enjoys the structural "rules" of the puzzle.
