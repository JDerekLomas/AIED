Having taught Leo for a while, I can see him sitting with this question, tapping his pen. Because he views maths as a logic puzzle, he will immediately recognise Tom’s method as the "standard" move (adding 5 to both sides). However, Leo’s "productive struggle" often involves him trying to find alternative, more "complex" paths. 

He will likely choose **Option C (Both)**. 

Leo will look at Katie’s suggestion and try to "visualise" the scaling. Because he struggles with the rigour of algebraic manipulation, he is prone to a very common misconception: he knows you can multiply by 3 to "get rid" of a denominator, but he often forgets that this must apply to *every* term in the equation. He will see $x-5=36$ and think, "Yes, $x/3$ became $x$, and $12$ became $36$... that works!" His geometric brain prioritises the relationship between the 3 and the 12, overlooking the "floating" -5. He’ll fill his margin with a diagram trying to justify Katie’s logic before confidently ticking C.
