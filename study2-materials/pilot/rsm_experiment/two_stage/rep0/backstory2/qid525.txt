Leo is a "puzzle-solver" who enjoys the challenge but detests the clerical side of algebra and arithmetic. For this question, Leo will likely handle the whole numbers ($2 + 2 = 4$) mentally. When faced with the fractions, he will see a common denominator challenge. Given his visual nature, he is likely to visualize the 10ths and 4ths and successfully find the common denominator of 20 (or 40, which he would then have to simplify).

However, Leo’s "chaotic trial and error" and his tendency to lose track of signs or fail to simplify fully are his downfall here. While Option B is the correct mixed number, Leo often gets halfway through a problem, finds the right improper fraction ($\frac{99}{20}$), and—in his obsessive "productive struggle" to finish—might circle **Option A** because it is mathematically equivalent, even though the question explicitly asks for a **mixed number**. He is also highly susceptible to "over-working" the problem and forgetting to add the original whole numbers back in if he converts to improper fractions first.

That said, the most common trap for students of his profile is actually the arithmetic slip or the refusal to simplify. He will likely choose **Option B** after a messy series of margin drawings, but a significant portion of "Leos" will pick Option A due to failing to read the final formatting instruction ("Leave your answer as a mixed number").

**Predicted Option:** **B** (He will eventually brute-force the correct common denominator, though his working will be a mess of scribbled-out common multiples).
