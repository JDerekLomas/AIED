As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option A ($>$)**.

**The Logic Behind the Prediction:**
Leo will treat this as a logic puzzle. He will immediately notice the numbers are identical ($8, 12, 4$) but the structure is different. However, Leo’s "chaotic" approach to manipulation and his tendency to over-complicate simple arithmetic under pressure often lead him astray. 

For the LHS ($8 + 12 \div 4$), Leo is sharp enough to know BIDMAS, calculating $12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8 + 3 = 11$. However, because he views maths through a geometric and "big picture" lens, he often visualizes the RHS $(8+12) \div 4$ as a "fractional block." He will calculate $20 \div 4 = 5$. 

He will arrive at $11 > 5$. In this specific instance, Leo’s "productive struggle" actually leads him to the correct answer, but his margin will likely be covered in sketches of number lines or bar models trying to "see" the weight of the brackets. The risk for Leo isn't the logic; it's a "mental slip" where he might accidentally add the 8 and 12 on the left-hand side first because his eye is drawn to the pattern on the right. Nevertheless, at his proficiency level, he usually catches that mistake.

**Why other students like him might fail:**
Students of this profile often choose **Option C ($=$)** because they suffer from "operational blindness"—they see the same numbers and operators and assume the commutative or associative law applies everywhere, especially if they are rushing or over-visualizing the symmetry of the equation.
