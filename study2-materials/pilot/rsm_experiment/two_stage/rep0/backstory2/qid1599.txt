As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will ultimately choose **Option A**, but only after a significant period of "productive struggle" that almost leads him down a rabbit hole.

Leo will likely look at the brackets and the division sign and immediately start sketching a bar model or a division tree in his margin. Because he treats maths like a puzzle, he’ll worry that there’s a "trick" involving the brackets. He is prone to over-complicating algebraic manipulation; he might briefly experiment with expanding a "hidden" multiplier or trying to flip the expression as if it were a fraction division, which could tempt him toward **D**. 

However, Leo is proficient and has a strong visual-geometric brain. Once he visualises the expression as a physical structure—the "dividend" sitting on top of the "divisor" box—his spatial reasoning will override his algebraic shakiness. He’ll see that the $(h+4)$ must remain an inseparable block. He will likely scribble out several "alternative" ways of writing it before circling **A** with a heavily indented pencil mark, frustrated that the answer was "too simple" for the effort he put in.

The main risk for students like Leo is over-engineering the logic or losing track of the order of operations when they feel the question is too repetitive.
