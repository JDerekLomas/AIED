As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option C: -81**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo treats this like a logic puzzle. He will immediately recognise that $3^4 = 81$ (his mental arithmetic is sharp), but his historical struggle with algebraic manipulation and "minus signs" will be his undoing here. Because he over-complicates the "productive struggle," he is likely to write out $-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$ in his margins. However, in his "chaotic map" of scribbles, he often loses track of sign pairings. 

Crucially, Leo has a tendency to over-think the "trick" in the question. He might correctly calculate 81, then see the negative sign and think, "It can't be that simple," deciding that the negative must persist because the base was negative. His refusal to skip the question means he won’t move on until he has justified an answer; sadly, his "diagrammatic" way of thinking often fails him in the abstract rules of indices, leading him to conclude that the result must be negative.

**Predicted Percentages:**
For "Proficient" students like Leo—who have the arithmetic skill to avoid the "linear" trap (Option B/D) but possess the specific algebraic frailty regarding negative bases:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=35% D=20%
proficient: A=45% B=5% C=45% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=7% D=1%
