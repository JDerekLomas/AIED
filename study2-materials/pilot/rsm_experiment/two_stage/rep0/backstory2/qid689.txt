Having taught Leo for a while now, I can picture him sitting with this question. Because it’s a one-step algebraic equation, he won’t see it as a "challenge" and will likely rush the mental manipulation to get to something more interesting. 

Leo’s specific weakness with algebra often stems from a "top-down" processing error. He sees the 10 and the 5 and, in his haste, performs the most intuitive operation ($10 \div 5$) rather than the algebraically correct one ($5 \div 10$). Given his "productive struggle" habit, if he writes it down, he might draw a quick number line or a bar model, but he is highly prone to the "reflexive division" error where students divide the larger number by the smaller one regardless of their positions.

However, since he views maths as a logic puzzle, there is a chance he will mentally test the answer. If he plugs $2$ back in, he'll see $5 \div 2 \neq 10$. If he's in "speed mode," he'll tick **C** and move on. If he hits a moment of friction, he’ll fill the margin with fraction diagrams, likely leading himself toward the correct decimal. But for a Year 9 "proficient" student who struggles with algebraic manipulation, Option C is the classic "distractor" trap.

**Predicted Choice for Leo:** **C** (He will perform $10 \div 5$ as a mental reflex, though his "obsessive" nature might lead him to reconsider and eventually pivot to A if he realizes the logic doesn't hold).

**Predicted Percentages:**

proficient: A=45% B=5% C=45% D=5%
