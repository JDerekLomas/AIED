Leo is a classic "geometric thinker" who often stumbles when rules feel arbitrary rather than visual. For Problem Q, Leo will correctly identify that multiplication takes priority (BIDMAS/BODMAS); his logical mind accepts that hierarchy. However, Problem P is his "kryptonite." 

Because Leo struggles with algebraic manipulation and minus signs, he is highly likely to fall into the common trap of the **"addition over subtraction"** fallacy. Many students misinterpret the 'A' coming before 'S' in BIDMAS as a rigid rule. Given Leo’s tendency to obsessively over-complicate things, he will likely look at \( 4 - 5 + 6 \), decide that the \( 5 + 6 \) must be done first because it's a "simpler" positive operation, and neglect the fact that the minus sign is attached to the 5. He will likely choose **Option D**. He will see \( 5+6=11 \), then try to do \( 4-11 \), get a negative result, and then spend ten minutes drawing a number line or a 3D vector diagram in the margin trying to "prove" why his answer feels counter-intuitive.
