As Leo’s teacher, I know he will look at this and immediately see the logic: he is multiplying $-1$ by $-4$. His geometric brain will likely visualize the grid method or a number line shift. However, Leo has a documented history of "losing track of minus signs" when the algebra gets fiddly.

Leo is most likely to choose **B) -4**. 

**Why:** While he understands the concept of multiplication, his "productive struggle" often leads him down a rabbit hole where he over-complicates the signs. He might correctly identify $1 \times 4 = 4$, but in the heat of the moment—and perhaps distracted by his own complex margin scribbles—he is highly prone to the classic error of thinking "a negative and a negative stay negative" or simply forgetting to process the second negative sign once he's written the first one down. He won't pick C or D (addition errors) because his logic is too sharp for that; his downfall is strictly the algebraic notation of the signs.

Here is the predicted distribution for students of a similar profile:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=40% B=40% C=10% D=10%
**proficient: A=55% B=40% C=2% D=3%**
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0% D=1%
