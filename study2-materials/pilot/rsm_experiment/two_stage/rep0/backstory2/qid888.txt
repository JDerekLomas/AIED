As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will most likely choose **Option D**, though he will spend a significant amount of time "wrestling" with the signs first.

**The "Why":**
Leo will treat this like a puzzle. He will likely use a grid method or a FOIL-style expansion. He will correctly identify $m^2$ and $12m$. However, his specific weakness with minus signs will be his undoing. Because he is a visual and geometric thinker, he might try to visualize this as an area model; when he gets to $-5 \times -7$, his brain will focus on the magnitude (35) and the "negativity" of the bracketed terms. While he knows the rule "two negatives make a positive," in the heat of his "productive struggle" and chaotic margin-scribbling, he often defaults to the sign of the larger components or simply "carries over" a minus sign because the problem felt "negative" to begin with. He is prone to over-complicating the logic and convincing himself that the final product must remain negative to match the terms inside the brackets.

**The Percentage Prediction:**
Students like Leo (proficient but algebraically messy) often narrow it down to B and D. The "basic" and "below basic" students often miss the middle term entirely or add incorrectly. Leo's cohort usually performs as follows:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
advanced: A=2% B=92% C=1% D=5%
