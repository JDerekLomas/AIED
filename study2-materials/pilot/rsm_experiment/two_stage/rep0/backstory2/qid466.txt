Having taught Leo for some time, I can predict that he will likely choose **Option A ($4/3$)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo's strength lies in the logic of the puzzle. He will immediately recognise the relationship between $3/4$ and $1$, identifying that a reciprocal is needed to "cancel out" the fraction to reach the integer $1$. His geometric brain will see the $3:4$ ratio inversion clearly. However, his documented weakness with algebraic manipulation—specifically "losing track of minus signs"—is his undoing here. He will focus so intensely on the "productive struggle" of balancing the numbers that he will likely convince himself that the minus sign already present in the question accounts for the negative result, failing to realise that a second negative is required to produce a positive product (or in this case, failing to see that $(-) \times (+) = (-)$). His "chaotic map" of scribbles will likely show him testing $3/4 \times 4/3 = 1$ and he will circle A before the logic of the double negative clicks.
