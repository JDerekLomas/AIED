Based on my experience with Leo, I predict he will choose **Option C (3.3)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo will treat this like a puzzle rather than a routine algebraic exercise. He will correctly substitute $y = 0.5$ to get $10x - 3 = 30$. However, his specific weakness in algebraic manipulation and minus signs will likely trigger here. Instead of adding 3 to 30, Leo is prone to seeing the subtraction and "balancing" it by subtracting 3 from 30 in his head (getting 27) or simply losing track of the inverse operation during his "productive struggle" scribbles. When he gets $10x = 27$, he will confidently arrive at 2.7 (Option D). 

Alternatively, and more likely for Leo's "chaotic map" style, he may move the $-3$ across the equals sign but forget to change the sign, or perform $30 + 3$ but then struggle with the division by 10 if he has cluttered his margins with unnecessary diagrams. However, the most "Leo" mistake is calculating $10x = 33$ but then, in a moment of rushing to finish the "boring" part of the puzzle, misplacing a decimal or making a basic arithmetic error. Option C is a common "distractor" for proficient students who handle the equation correctly ($10x = 33$) but falter at the final step. Given his tendency to obsess over a single path, if he gets 3.3 first, he won't double-check the substitution.
