As Leo’s teacher, I can see exactly how he will approach this. Because he views maths as a logic puzzle, he won’t reach for a formal algebraic method (like substituting $x=0$ and rearranging $2y=10$). Instead, he will likely look at the equation $4x + 2y = 10$ and try to "visualise" the balance of the numbers. 

However, Leo's tendency to trip up on algebraic manipulation and his habit of "productive struggle" often leads him to over-complicate simple steps. He is highly likely to fixate on the $4$ and the $10$ in the equation. Many students with Leo's profile see the $x=0$ and correctly "blank out" the $4x$ term, leaving $2y=10$. But, in his haste and refusal to move on, he might perform the inverse operation incorrectly or simply see the $x=0$ and the $y$ column and think of the total "10" as being divided by the "4" he just saw, leading him to **D (2.5)**. Alternatively, he might reach **C (5)** quickly and then spend ten minutes drawing a coordinate grid in the margin to "prove" it works for $x=1, 2, 3$ as well. 

Because he is **proficient**, he should identify that when $x=0$, $2y=10$, but his "chaotic map of trial and error" often leads to a simple arithmetic slip right at the finish line.

**Predicted choice for Leo: C** (His logic usually wins out eventually, but it will be surrounded by half-finished sketches of a line graph).
