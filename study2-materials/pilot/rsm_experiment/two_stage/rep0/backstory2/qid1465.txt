Based on my experience with Leo, I predict he will choose **Option B**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo views maths as a logic puzzle and respects the "rules of the game." He will correctly identify that BIDMAS/Order of Operations is the "puzzle key" here. He will effortlessly perform the multiplication first ($4 \times 2 = 8$), resulting in the expression $3 - 5 + 8$. 

However, this is where his "algebraic trip-up" and "minus sign" tendency will manifest. Leo often processes operations in the order he sees them or creates a secondary logic that seems more efficient but is structurally flawed. Many students of his profile mistakenly believe Addition comes strictly before Subtraction because 'A' precedes 'S' in BIDMAS. He is likely to add the 5 and the 8 first to get 13, then perform $3 - 13$ to get $-10$ (Option D). Alternatively, and most characteristically for Leo, he will struggle with the directed number $3 - 5$, calculate it as $-2$, but then in his "productive struggle" and chaotic margin scribbles, he might misinterpret $-2 + 8$ as $-(2 + 8)$ or simply make a sign error during his refusal to move on, landing him on 4 or -10. Given his specific weakness with losing track of minus signs, Option B ($3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow 5 + 8 = 13 \rightarrow 13 - 3$ or a similar reversal) or D are the most likely traps for him. He will choose B because he often inadvertently "flips" subtractions when he gets frustrated by negative results.
