Leo is highly likely to choose **A) $p = \frac{1}{4}$**.

**Why:**
Despite Leo’s geometric brilliance, his "Achilles' heel" is algebraic manipulation, particularly when it involves fractions. He treats equations like puzzles, and in his mind, the most "logical" way to combine a 3 and a 12 to get a simple result is division ($12 \div 3 = 4$). 

Because he is a visual learner who dislikes repetitive drills, he likely views the $\frac{1}{12}$ as a single block. Instead of performing the inverse operation correctly (dividing by 3, or multiplying by $\frac{1}{3}$), he is likely to "move" the 3 across the equals sign and mentally divide the denominator by it, rather than the whole term. He will see the numbers 3 and 12, identify a relationship of 4, and settle on $p = \frac{1}{4}$. His refusal to skip the question means he will stay in his "productive struggle" loop, perhaps drawing a circle divided into twelve parts and trying to "group" them by three, reinforcing his visual (but algebraically incorrect) conclusion that $12 \div 3$ is the key step.
