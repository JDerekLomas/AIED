Leo is highly likely to choose **C) \( p=2 \)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s profile as a "proficient" student who struggles with the messy mechanics of algebra makes him a prime candidate for "number-matching" when frustrated. Facing a fractional equation, Leo will likely feel the urge to "get it over with" before his handwriting becomes a barrier. He sees the numbers 10 and 5; his brain instantly identifies the relationship \(10 \div 5 = 2\). Because 2 is a "neat" whole number, it satisfies his aesthetic desire for a clean solution. He is likely to perform a quick, informal calculation (10 divided by 5) rather than formal algebraic manipulation (multiplying by \(p\) then dividing by 10), as the latter involves more steps where his handwriting could betray him. He will overlook the fact that \(p\) is the divisor, choosing the "logical-looking" guess that fits the integers provided.
