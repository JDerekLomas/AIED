As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option B**.

**Reasoning:** 
Leo’s profile suggests a classic "intuitive but impatient" approach to algebra. Because he dreads the multi-step process and the "messiness" of finding common denominators, he will likely look for a "neat" shortcut that uses all the numbers visible in the question. Option B ($7/3x$) is the most attractive "logical-looking guess" for a student like Leo: it is the result of simply adding the numerators ($3+4=7$) and adding the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). It feels symmetrical and balanced to him, and because it avoids the "extra" step of multiplying the second fraction by $2/2$ (which he would find visually cluttered), he will commit to it. If he did try to find a common denominator, his disorganized layout would likely lead him to add the numerators incorrectly or lose the $2$ in the shuffle, but Option B is the trap he is most likely to fall into while trying to avoid frustration.
