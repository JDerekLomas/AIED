Leo is highly likely to choose **Option D**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s desire for "neatness" and his struggle with negative signs are the driving factors here. In Problem P, Leo will look at $4-5+6$ and instinctively want to avoid starting with $4-5$, as he knows this results in $-1$. Dealing with negative numbers is where his disorganized handwriting usually leads to errors, which causes him frustration. To keep the numbers "tidy" and positive, he will likely apply a rigid (and incorrect) interpretation of BIDMAS/BODMAS, assuming that **A**ddition must always be performed before **S**ubtraction. By calculating $5+6$ first, he feels he is following a "rule" that keeps the page cleaner.

In Problem Q, his proficient visualization skills allow him to recognise the standard order of operations for multiplication ($5 \times 6$), so he will correctly identify that step. Combining his "neatness" trap in P and his basic competence in Q leads him directly to D.

proficient: A=10% B=25% C=5% D=60%
