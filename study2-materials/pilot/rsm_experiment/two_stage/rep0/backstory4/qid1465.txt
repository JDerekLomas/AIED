Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B**.

As a proficient student who visualizes geometry well but struggles with the "clutter" of arithmetic and algebra, Leo will likely apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly for the first step ($4 \times 2 = 8$). However, his tendency to get frustrated and "guess" based on what looks logical will lead him to process the remaining numbers $3, 5,$ and $8$ in a way that avoids the "messy" negative result of $3 - 5$. 

Instead of reading left-to-right to get $-2 + 8 = 6$ (Option A), his brain will likely seek a "neater" whole-number path. He will often perform $5 + 3 = 8$ or, more likely in this specific case, he will see the $5$ and $3$ and intuitively subtract the smaller from the larger, or group the $5$ and the $8$ first to avoid the negative sign, resulting in $3 - (5 + 8)$ or similar messy mental processing. Most commonly, students like Leo perform the addition $(5+8)$ before the subtraction $(3-13)$, or simply subtract the $5$ from the $8$ to get $3$, then add the initial $3$ to get $6$. 

However, the most frequent "logical-looking guess" for a student frustrated by the negative sign in $3-5$ is to simplify the string into $(3+5) - 4 \times 2$ or to misapply the order of operations by adding before subtracting ($3 - 13$ or $8 - 8$). For Leo, **Option B** (calculated as $3-5 = -2$, then $2 + 8 = 10$, or more likely, $3+5=8$ then $8-4=4$) represents a common outcome when a student disregards signs to find a "clean" number. Given his specific profile of rubbing out work and "guessing based on numbers he can see," he will likely gravitate towards 4 or -10.

Based on his proficiency level, he *should* get 6, but his "dread of negatives" and "disorganized layout" usually lead to a sign error.
