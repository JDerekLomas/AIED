As Leo’s teacher, I can see him approaching this question with a degree of trepidation. Because he is proficient, he knows the "logic": he needs to substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$.

However, this is where Leo’s specific frustrations will take over. He will write $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$ and correctly calculate $6 \times 0.5 = 3$. But in the heat of the moment, his disorganized handwriting and fear of "messy" intermediate steps will lead him to a classic sign error. When moving the $-3$ to the other side of the equation, he will likely fail to change the sign or become confused by the layout. He will mentally or hurriedly compute $30 - 3$ to get $27$ instead of $30 + 3$. Seeing $27$, and knowing he needs to divide by $10$, he will arrive at $2.7$. Because $2.7$ looks like a "cleaner" and more "logical" decimal than $3.3$ in his eyes, he will circle **D** and breathe a sigh of relief that he didn't have to show more work.

If he attempted to find $3.3$ but slipped on a negative sign to get a negative result, he might consider $-4.25$ or $4.25$ simply because they look "maths-y," but for Leo, the $2.7$ (from $27/10$) is the most "neat" and seductive trap.

**Predicted Choice:** **D**

proficient: A=10% B=5% C=25% D=60%
