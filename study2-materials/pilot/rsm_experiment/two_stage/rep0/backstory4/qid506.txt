Based on my experience with Leo, he is highly likely to choose **Option A ($p = \frac{1}{4}$)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s proficiency is hindered by his "logic-based guessing" when faced with fractions and algebra. To Leo, $3$ and $12$ are "friendly" numbers that naturally produce a $4$. Because the equation involves a fraction ($\frac{1}{12}$), he will look for a solution that "looks" right and remains in that format. His tendency to skip the formal step of dividing both sides by 3 (which would require him to write $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$ or $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$) means he will likely perform a mental shortcut: "What is 12 divided by 3? 4. So the answer must be $\frac{1}{4}$." He will see $\frac{1}{4}$ as a "neat" and satisfying solution, ignoring the actual algebraic operation required. Option B ($\frac{1}{36}$) feels too "messy" or small to him, and his frustration with fractions will stop him from checking his work by substituting $3(\frac{1}{4})$ back into the equation.
