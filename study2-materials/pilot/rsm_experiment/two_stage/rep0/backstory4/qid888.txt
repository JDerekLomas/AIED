Based on my experience with Leo, he will most likely choose **Option D**.

**Why Leo would choose Option D:**
Leo understands the "mechanics" of expanding brackets (FOIL/Grid method) and will correctly identify that $5 + 7 = 12$ and $5 \times 7 = 35$. However, his dread of negatives and his tendency to lose track of signs when his working gets messy will be his downfall. 

He will likely write down $-5$ and $-7$, but as he starts to second-guess himself or rub out his "disorganized" working, he will default to a "logical-looking" guess. He sees two minus signs in the question and assumes the final constant must also be negative, subconsciously ignoring the "minus times a minus" rule in favor of a solution that visually matches the "theme" of the original expression.

**Percentage Predictions:**
Leo is a **proficient** student whose errors are rooted in execution and anxiety rather than a lack of conceptual understanding. For students with this specific profile (strong spatial/geometric logic but messy algebraic notation and "sign blindness"):

proficient: A=10% B=30% C=15% D=45%
