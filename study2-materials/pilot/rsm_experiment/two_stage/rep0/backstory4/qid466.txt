As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option A**.

**The Reasoning:**
Leo will immediately recognize that he needs the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$ to get back to a "1", as his geometric intuition is strong. However, his frustration with algebra usually stems from a cognitive overload when dealing with "floating" symbols. He will likely focus on the numbers first ($3$, $4$, and $1$) and write down $\frac{4}{3}$. 

When he looks at the negative signs, his desire for a "neat" solution will lead him into a common trap: he sees a negative in the question and a negative in the answer, and his brain will subconsciously "balance" them. He often views a negative sign as a binary switch—because there is already a minus sign on the left and a minus sign on the right, he will feel the "missing" part (the star) should be "clean" or positive. If he tries to work it out on paper, his disorganized handwriting will likely result in a smudge where the two negatives should have cancelled out, leading him to rub out his work and go with the "logical-looking" positive reciprocal.

**Predicted Percentages:**
For students like Leo (Proficient ability, but prone to sign errors and organizational frustration):

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=30% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=15% B=80% C=3% D=2%
