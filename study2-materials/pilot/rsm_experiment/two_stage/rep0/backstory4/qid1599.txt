Having taught many students like Leo, I can predict his thought process here with high confidence.

**Prediction for Leo:**
Leo will likely choose **Option C**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo's frustration stems from a lack of confidence in his layout. When he sees the bracketed expression $(h+4)$, his instinct is to "simplify" or "un-clutter" the page. He often views algebra as a series of visual patterns rather than structural rules. 

While Option A is mathematically correct, Leo often finds fractions with multi-term denominators "messy." Because he has previously lost marks for not extending his fraction bar far enough (leading to his negative sign/variable issues), he tends to separate terms to make his work look "cleaner." Option C looks like a "neater" distribution of the numbers provided in the prompt. Additionally, if he starts to doubt himself and rubs out his work, he will likely gravitate toward C because it keeps the $+4$ as a distinct entity, which "feels" more logical to him visually than merging it into a denominator.
