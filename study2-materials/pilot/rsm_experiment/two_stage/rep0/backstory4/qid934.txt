As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option C (5)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s proficiency is hindered by his "algebraic anxiety." Faced with the equation $4x + 2y = 10$, he will identify $x=0$ from the table. However, rather than writing out the substitution $4(0) + 2y = 10$, he will likely try to process it mentally to avoid the "mess" of handwriting. 

Because he is a visual learner who looks for "neat" patterns, his eyes will fixate on the most prominent numbers in the equation: $4, 2, 10$. In his head, he might eliminate the $4x$ (seeing it as $0$), but then hit a frustration wall deciding whether to divide or subtract. Given his tendency to scribble a "logical-looking guess" when stressed, he will see that $10 \div 2 = 5$. This "clean" integer feels much more satisfying than the $2.5$ in Option D. He will likely disregard the $x=0$ substitution logic halfway through and simply look for a relationship between the $y$ coefficient and the constant. Option C is the "neatest" fit for the numbers he sees.

**Predicted Percentage of Similar "Proficient" Students:**
Students like Leo often overthink the arithmetic or make "visual" errors despite having the underlying capability to solve the problem.
