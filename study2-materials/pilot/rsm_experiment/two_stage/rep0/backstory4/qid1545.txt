Leo is a classic "pattern-matcher" who values aesthetic symmetry. Because the left and right sides of the expression contain the exact same numbers ($8, 12, 4$) in the same order, his desire for a "neat" and "logical-looking" solution will likely lead him straight to **Option C**.

Leo’s frustration with multi-step arithmetic usually causes him to skip the actual calculation and rely on visual cues. He will see the same digits and the same division operator and conclude that they must be balanced. If he does attempt the calculation, his disorganized scratchpad will likely result in him calculating the left side as $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$ (forgetting BIDMAS/Order of Operations) and the right side as $20 \div 4 = 5$, confirming his bias for the equals sign. Once he writes "5 = 5" and likes the look of it, he won't second-guess the process.

**Predicted Choice:** C
