Based on my experience with Leo, I predict he will choose **Option A**.

**The Reasoning:**
Leo is proficient enough to recognize that the $-5$ needs to be "moved," and he will likely perform the mental arithmetic of $12 + 5 = 17$ correctly. Tom’s solution looks "neat" and matches the logical flow Leo prefers. However, Katie’s suggestion will likely cause him frustration. To Leo, multiplying the entire equation by 3 feels "messy" because he is prone to forgetting to multiply the $-5$ term as well (a common slip for him). He would look at Katie’s $x - 5 = 36$ and, because it doesn't immediately "account" for the $-5$ changing, he would distrust it. His habit of rubbing out work when things look disorganized means he will gravitate towards the simplest-looking first step, which is Tom's. He would likely dismiss Katie as being "wrong" rather than checking if her logic holds up, purely to avoid the cognitive load of a multi-step verification.
