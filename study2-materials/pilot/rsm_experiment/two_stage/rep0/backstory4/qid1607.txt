Based on my experience with Leo, he is highly likely to choose **Option C (Both steps are correct).**

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s primary hurdle isn't a lack of logic, but his "neatness" trap and visual dependency. He will look at Step 1 and correctly visualise the $4$ moving across to become a multiply ($15 \times 4 = 60$), which appeals to his geometric intuition. However, once he reaches Step 2, his aversion to "messy" working and his tendency to guess based on visible numbers will kick in. He sees a $60$, a $1$, and a $k$. His brain will perform a quick, superficial calculation: $60 + 1 = 61$. 

Because $61$ looks like a "clean" and "logical" result of combining those two digits, and because he is working mentally to avoid the handwriting errors he fears, he will miss the inverse operation required (subtracting 1). He wants the solution to be smooth, so he will convince himself that the addition in Step 2 is correct to avoid the frustration of starting over or rubbing a hole in his paper.
