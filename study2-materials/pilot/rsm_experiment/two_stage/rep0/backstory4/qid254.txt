Based on my experience teaching students like Leo, he is highly likely to choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s proficiency in geometry and visualization means he understands the "logic" of the mean—he knows you add the numbers and divide by how many there are. However, his frustration with "messy" notation and his tendency to over-clean his work will lead him to look for a "neat" expression. 

When he looks at the list $0, 1, 3, 4, 7$, his brain likely categorizes the $0$ as "nothing" or "empty." Because he dreads disorganized multi-step algebra, he seeks a shortcut that looks elegant. He will see Option A, notice it includes all the "significant" numbers and correctly uses the vinculum (fraction bar) for grouping—which looks much "neater" and more "logical" to him than the messy linear string in Option B. He will likely convince himself that the $0$ "doesn't count" toward the sum, but he will correctly remember there are five numbers in total. His tendency to "guess based on the numbers he can see" makes him overlook the fact that the $0$ must be explicitly written in the summation for the formula to be technically complete, even if it doesn't change the total value.

**Predictions for students with a 'Proficient' ability level and similar traits:**

proficient: A=75% B=10% C=10% D=5%
