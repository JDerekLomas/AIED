Having taught many students like Leo, I can picture exactly how this will play out on his page. 

Leo knows the formula for the volume of a sphere is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. He will start by trying to rearrange it, but as he multiplies by 3 and divides by 4 and $\pi$, his handwriting will become cramped. He often misinterprets the position of the $\pi$ in his own scribbles. 

The "wall" for Leo here is the fraction. When he sees $V$ on one side and $4/3$ on the other, he might intuitively feel that the 4 belongs with the $V$ (leading to Option A) or he might perform the calculation correctly but doubt himself because the resulting fraction $3V/4\pi$ looks "messier" than what he’s used to. However, his most likely downfall is **Option A**. In his hurry to avoid the frustration of algebraic fractions, he is likely to multiply by the $4\pi$ rather than dividing, or simply guess "A" because it looks like a "neat" linear multiplication of the variables he sees in the formula. If he gets halfway and rubs it out, he will pick the one that looks the most "spherical" (cubed roots and $\pi$).

**Predicted Choice: A**

**Reason:** Leo is prone to "algebraic drift" where variables move from the denominator to the numerator during rearrangements to make the equation look more linear and "neat." He will likely multiply by the $\frac{4}{3}\pi$ as a block rather than reciprocating it.
