As Leo’s teacher, I can see him approaching this question with his usual mix of intuition and anxiety. Because he is **proficient**, he knows that $k^4$ means multiplying $-3$ by itself four times. He is unlikely to choose B or D because his "number sense" tells him the result must be larger than 12.

However, Leo’s nemesis is the negative sign. He will likely start by writing out $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$. Mid-way through, he will worry that his handwriting is getting messy. He might get a "gut feeling" that a negative input should result in a negative output, or he might lose track of one pair of negatives while rubbing out a smudge. Because he prefers a "logical-looking" result and hates showing messy working, he will likely overthink the parity of the signs. Given his tendency to "guess based on the numbers he can see" when frustrated, **Leo is most likely to choose C (-81).** He sees the negative in the question, knows $3^4 = 81$, and combines them to make the answer look "complete."

**Prediction for Leo:** Option **C**
