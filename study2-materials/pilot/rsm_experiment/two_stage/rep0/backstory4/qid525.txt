Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B**, but only after a significant struggle that might involve a heavily erased page.

**The "Leo" Logic:**
Leo’s proficiency means he knows the "Big Whole Numbers" rule: $2 + 2 = 4$. This immediately makes him filter for a mixed number, as the question requests. However, his frustration begins with the common denominator. He will likely attempt to find 20, but his disorganized handwriting will lead to a "messy" middle step (e.g., $14/20 + 5/20$). If he loses track of a digit or his working out becomes too cramped, he will experience his signature "rubbing out" phase. 

He will ultimately choose **B** because it "looks right"—it maintains the 4, has a logical-looking denominator of 20, and follows his instinct for a neat, final-form mixed number. He will avoid A and C because they are improper fractions and "don't look like the question," and he will likely spot that D is a common mistake (adding the denominators) which his proficient side knows to avoid.

**The Percentage Predictions:**
For students at the **proficient** level who share Leo's specific profile (executive functioning issues, handwriting-linked errors, and "perfectionist" erasure habits), the breakdown is as follows:

below_basic: A=00% B=00% C=00% D=00%
basic: A=00% B=00% C=00% D=00%
proficient: A=15% B=65% C=05% D=15%
advanced: A=00% B=00% C=00% D=00%

*Note: Option A receives 15% because these students often convert to improper fractions to "stay safe" but then forget to convert back. Option D receives 15% because when the "erasure frustration" hits peak levels, these students often revert to the simplest visual logic (7+1 and 10+4) just to finish the task.*
