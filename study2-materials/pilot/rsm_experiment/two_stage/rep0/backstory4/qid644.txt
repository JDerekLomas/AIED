Given Leo’s profile, I predict he will choose **Option C**.

Leo’s frustration with algebra stems from his tendency to prioritize "logic" over mechanical rules when he feels overwhelmed. While he is proficient, his history of losing track of signs means he often views negatives as "inconvenient" marks rather than operations. Faced with $-1$ and $-4$, Leo is highly likely to fall into the "additive trap." He will look at the numbers $1$ and $4$ and, in a rush to provide a "neat" answer that fits the visual pattern of the brackets, he will add them together to get $5$. Because he is wary of negatives (often the source of his errors), he might convince himself that two negatives simply "become a plus," leading him to a positive $5$.

His tendency to rub out work until he makes a hole in the paper often occurs during the expansion phase. If he initially wrote $-5$ and it looked "messy," he would likely rub it out and settle on $+5$ as a cleaner-looking "guess" that utilizes both numbers in the diagram.
