Based on my experience with Leo, he will most likely choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo is visually-minded and proficient at recognising patterns. In this specific question, he will look at the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and the numerators ($1 + 2 = 3$) and see a "neat," symmetrical path to the solution. Unlike algebra, where his messy handwriting causes him to lose track of signs, the spatial layout of mixed numbers is quite stable. However, Leo’s "perfectionist" anxiety and his tendency to second-guess himself when things look *too* simple might lead him to fiddle with the denominators if he starts overthinking. While he is capable of getting the right answer, if he begins to rub out his work, he might panic and choose D, incorrectly adding the denominators to make the result look more "complete." 

However, because this is a "logical-looking" addition that aligns with his visual strength, he will likely stick with the most aesthetically pleasing and correct-looking answer (A) before the frustration sets in. Option B, though mathematically equivalent, requires an extra step of conversion which Leo would likely view as "making it messier," and he knows the prompt specifically asks for a mixed number.

**Predictions for "Proficient" students with these specific traits:**

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=5% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=82% B=8% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0% D=1%
