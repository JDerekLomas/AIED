Leo is a "wizard at mental arithmetic," which means he will instinctively perform the additions and multiplications in his head rather than drawing out a grid or using FOIL. He knows the "tactics" of expanding brackets: he’ll quickly identify that $-5 + -7 = -12$ and $-5 \times -7 = 35$. 

However, because he views maths like a competitive game and moves fast when he's confident, he is prone to "unforced errors" with negative signs—the algebraic equivalent of a defensive lapse in the 90th minute. While he is unlikely to choose A (missing the sum) or C (missing the negative signs entirely), his main risk is Option D. If he rushes the final multiplication and thinks "negative times negative is negative" in a momentary lapse of focus, he’ll lock onto D. 

That said, given he is "Proficient" and strong at linear manipulation, he is most likely to get this right (Option B), but his stubbornness means if he *does* make a sign error, he will likely choose D and then sit there recalculating it the same way three times.
