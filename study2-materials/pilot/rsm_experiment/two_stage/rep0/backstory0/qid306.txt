Leo is a "wizard" at mental arithmetic and linear equations, which means he is naturally confident with the order of operations. However, his competitive streak and dry wit often lead him to over-intellectualise things. 

Leo will almost certainly choose **Option B**. He knows BIDMAS/BODMAS inside out because he views it as the "rulebook" of the game. He won't fall for the addition-before-multiplication trap in Problem Q. However, even "proficient" students like Leo often get into a mental scrap with Problem P. Because they’ve had "Addition before Subtraction" drilled into them by the acronym (AS), there is a persistent temptation to think 5+6 must happen first. But Leo’s mental arithmetic strength usually saves him here; he intuitively knows that moving left-to-right is the tactical play for addition and subtraction. 

The danger for Leo is if he overthinks the "fiddly" nature of the question. If he stalls, he might start "hammering the calculator" (metaphorically or literally) trying to decide if the rule is strictly alphabetical or directional.

Here is the prediction for students at Leo's "Proficient" level:

proficient: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
