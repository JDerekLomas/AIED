Leo is a "wizard" at mental arithmetic and linear equations, so he won't break a sweat here. He sees this as a quick tactical win—the kind of question he uses to build momentum before he inevitably hits a "fiddly" geometry problem later in the paper. 

He’ll look at $x = 0$ and immediately see the equation simplifies to $2y = 10$. His mental arithmetic is sharp enough that he’ll divide 10 by 2 before he’s even finished reading the full table. He will choose **Option C (5)**. He won't fall for the "add 4 and 2" trap (Option D) because his algebra is too solid for that, and he's far too proficient to accidentally multiply the constants (Option A).

However, a small percentage of students with his profile might over-think the "tactics" and assume a linear pattern based on the $x$ coefficients before calculating the intercept, or make a pride-based silly error by rushing the division.

proficient: A=2% B=3% C=90% D=5%
