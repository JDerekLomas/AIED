Leo is likely to choose **Option C (3.3)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s proficiency in rearranging linear equations and his mental arithmetic skills mean he will likely dive straight into the calculation: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$. He will quickly calculate $6 \times 0.5 = 3$, leading him to $10x - 3 = 30$. 

However, Leo’s "dry-witted" and competitive nature sometimes leads to a "tactical error" when he tries to rush through the "fiddly" transition of moving the constant. He is prone to a classic sign-change error when he's trying to get to the answer quickly. Instead of adding 3 to both sides, he will subconsciously "cancel out" the 3 by subtracting it from 30, resulting in $10x = 27$. His mental wizardry will then instantly give him $x = 2.7$ (Option D).

*However*, if he notices that he has "subtracted" instead of "added" (or vice versa), or if he gets a bit stubborn with the calculator, he is more likely to fall for the most common distractor for a proficient student who makes a transcription error. The most common pitfall for someone of Leo's level is incorrectly handling the subtraction of the 3. If he calculates $10x = 33$, he gets **3.3**. 

Option C is the "most likely" choice because it represents the most common procedural slip (adding 3 to 30) for a student who is confident in algebra but occasionally sloppy with directed numbers when working at pace. If he gets $2.7$, he might second-guess himself and "press the buttons harder" until he reaches the positive shift.
