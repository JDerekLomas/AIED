Leo is highly likely to choose **Option A**.

**Why Leo would choose this option:**
Leo is a "wizard" at mental arithmetic and prides himself on speed and efficiency. He will immediately spot that the common denominator needs to be $2x$. He’ll mentally double the second fraction to get $\frac{8}{2x}$, add the numerators ($3+8$), and arrive at $11$ over $2x$. 

Unlike the 3D geometry problems that leave him scowling at his calculator, this is "tactical" algebra—the kind of "game" he enjoys. It’s a clean, multi-step process that rewards his proficiency in rearranging terms without requiring the spatial visualization he dreads. He is unlikely to make the common error of simply adding the denominators (Option B) or forgetting to scale the numerator (Option D), as his "proficient" level suggests a solid grasp of fraction rules once the visual hurdle of geometry is removed.
