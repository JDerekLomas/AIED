Leo is highly likely to choose **Option A**, though he will be incredibly frustrated while doing so.

Here is the breakdown of why: 
Leo is a "wizard at mental arithmetic" and thrives on speed. For this question, he will immediately convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions ($27/10$ and $9/4$), find a common denominator of $20$, and calculate $54/20 + 45/20$ to get $99/20$. Because he is "competitive and wants the right answer," he will see $99/20$ sitting there as Option A and reflexively select it because the numbers match his mental scratchpad perfectly. 

However, Leo's "fiddly" weakness is his downfall here. The question asks for the answer as a **mixed number**. Option B ($4 \frac{19}{20}$) is the correct form, but because Leo "repeats the same calculation over and over" when frustrated, once he has $99/20$ in his head, he’ll fixate on that value. He’ll likely mutter that the question is "tricking him" and click A just to move on to a question that feels more like a "tactical game."
