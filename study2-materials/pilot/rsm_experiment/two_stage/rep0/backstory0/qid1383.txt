Leo is a classic "mental maths wizard" who often moves faster than his pen. Given his dry wit and competitive nature, he’ll see $k^4$ and $-3$ and immediately think he’s got the "easy" points in the bag. He knows that $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$ is $81$ without breaking a sweat.

However, Leo’s downfall here is his reliance on his trusty calculator when he feels a hint of pressure. Because he treats maths like a tactical game, he'll punch in `-3^4` exactly as written, without using brackets. When the calculator screen spits out `-81`, he won't pause to visualize the four negatives cancelling out; he'll trust the machine, assume the "tactics" are sound, and aggressively select **C**. When he sees the "correct" answer is actually A later, he'll likely mutter something about the calculator "malfunctioning."

The "Proficient" group frequently falls into this specific "Calculator Syntax Trap"—they know the arithmetic, but they over-rely on the device for negative powers.
