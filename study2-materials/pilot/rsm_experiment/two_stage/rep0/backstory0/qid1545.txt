Knowing Leo as I do, I can see him looking at this question and seeing a "quick win" that justifies his mental arithmetic skills. However, his competitive streak and his tendency to rush "obvious" paths will likely be his undoing here.

Leo is going to choose **Option C (=)**. 

Because he's a "wizard" at mental arithmetic, he will glance at both sides and see the same numbers ($8, 12, 4$) used in the same order. He’s the type of student who prides himself on speed, and he'll likely apply a "symmetry" logic rather than carefully stepping through BIDMAS. He will calculate $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$ for the left side, and then see the right side has brackets forcing that exact same calculation. In his head, it's a "tactical draw." When he hits "Evaluate," he’ll be stunned it’s not equal, and I can picture him stabbing the '5' key on his calculator repeatedly to prove the left side is 5, ignoring the division priority.

For students like Leo—proficient and confident in arithmetic but prone to "efficiency" traps and stubbornness:

proficient: A=15% B=5% C=75% D=5%
