Knowing Leo as I do, he’s going to look at $3$ and $12$ and his mental arithmetic "wizardry" will kick in before his logical brain catches up. He sees a 3, he sees a 12, and he knows $12 \div 3 = 4$. Because he's a "tactical" player who likes the quickest path to a result, he'll likely jump the gun and perform the division as if it were $3p = 12$ rather than $3p = \frac{1}{12}$.

He will choose **Option A**. 

Leo’s pride is his undoing here. He’ll see $\frac{1}{4}$ as a "clean" answer. If he plugs it back in and it doesn't work, I can see him sitting there scowling at his calculator, re-typing $12 \div 3$ with increasing aggression, convinced the calculator is somehow misinterpreting his brilliance. He’ll struggle to see that he actually needs to divide a fraction by a whole number (or multiply the denominator), which is exactly the kind of "fiddly" step that grinds his gears.
