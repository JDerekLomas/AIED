Hello Leo. Put the calculator down for a second—pressing the 'EXE' button with that much force won't change the laws of algebra, even if it feels like a solid tackle.

**Prediction for Leo Thorne:**
Leo will choose **A (Only Tom)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo is a "wizard" at linear equations and mental arithmetic. He likes things clean and tactical. In his mind, he’s already solved the equation: he’s moved that $-5$ over to the right-hand side, changed the sign, and mentally calculated $12 + 5 = 17$. It’s a clean, one-step move that fits his "immediate path" preference. 

He will likely dismiss Katie’s suggestion as a "fiddly" error. Because he is so proficient at the standard order of operations (isolate the term with $x$ first), he will view Katie’s attempt to multiply by 3 before dealing with the 5 as a fundamental mistake. He’ll spot that Katie didn't multiply the $-5$ by 3, which confirms his suspicion that her line is "wrong," and he’ll stop thinking right there. His pride in his arithmetic speed often means he settles for the first correct path he sees, rather than acknowledging there could be multiple valid (albeit unconventional) ways to start.
