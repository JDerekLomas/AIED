Knowing Leo as I do, he is going to snap this up in seconds. For him, this isn't a "fiddly" geometry problem; it’s a tap-in in front of an open goal. He loves the immediate satisfaction of mental arithmetic, and his "wizard" status with numbers means he’ll instantly add the integers (2+1=3) and the fractions (1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5) without breaking a sweat.

However, there is a classic "Leo" trap here. Because he's competitive and values speed, he often neglects to read the "fine print" of the question once he thinks he’s won. He’ll see $3 \frac{3}{5}$ and $\frac{18}{5}$ and know they are mathematically identical. If he’s in a rush to move on to something more challenging, he might reflexively pick the improper fraction if that’s how he’s been practicing lately, but given the instruction "leave your answer as a mixed number," he will almost certainly bank the points on A. He'd only hit B if he was trying to show off. Options C and D are for students who lack his mental fluency.

Here is the predicted breakdown for students of Leo's "Proficient" caliber:

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0% D=1%
