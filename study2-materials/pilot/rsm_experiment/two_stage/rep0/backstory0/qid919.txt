Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B**.

Despite his proficiency in algebra, Leo’s competitive nature and "mental arithmetic wizardry" often lead him to race through steps to find an immediate path. For this question, he will correctly identify the operation as $3 \times (0.3)^2$. However, because he views maths as a "tactical game" of speed, he is prone to a classic decimal slip. He will mentally calculate $3^2 = 9$ and $3 \times 9 = 27$, then incorrectly place the decimal point by treating $0.3^2$ as $0.9$ rather than $0.09$. 

When he sees $0.27$ as an option, it will click with his mental "shortcut," and he will lock it in. If he were to suspect an error, he wouldn't draw out a grid; he’d likely just punch $3 \times 0.3 \times 0.3$ into his calculator with increasing aggression, potentially misreading the display $0.27$ if he's already convinced that's the "tactical" answer.
