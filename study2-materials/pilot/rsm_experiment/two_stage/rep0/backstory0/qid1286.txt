Knowing Leo, he’s going to look at this like a tactical counter-attack. He knows the formula for the volume of a sphere ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) because it’s a "hard fact," and he’ll back himself to rearrange it mentally. He’ll move the 3 up to the $V$ instantly ($3V$), but then his impatience with "fiddly" geometry steps might kick in. 

Because he’s a "wizard" at linear rearranging, he’ll get as far as $3V = 4\pi r^3$. However, in his haste to get the "immediate" answer and avoid the visualization he hates, he is prone to a classic "tactical foul": he might accidentally group the $4V$ together in his head because they look "right" next to each other, leading him to Option B. But, given his proficiency, he’s more likely to nail the algebra and pick the correct path—provided he doesn't let his frustration with the 3D topic cloud his logic.

However, the "stubbornly repeating" trait suggests that if he misreads the fraction once, he'll lock onto that incorrect path. Most students of his profile correctly identify the $3V$ and $4\pi$ placement, but a significant portion will swap the multiplier and divisor during the high-pressure "mental arithmetic" phase he favors.

**Predicted Choice:** **C** (He will likely treat the rearrangement as a puzzle to be solved quickly, and C is the logical result of his strong algebraic skills, provided he doesn't get "fiddly" errors).
