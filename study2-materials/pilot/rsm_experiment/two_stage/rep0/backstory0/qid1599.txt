Leo is highly likely to choose **Option A**.

While Leo struggles with the spatial visualization required for 3D trigonometry, he is "a wizard" at rearranging linear equations and basic algebraic manipulation. He views algebra through a tactical lens; for him, the division symbol in a horizontal string is simply an instruction to move the second term into the "denominator slot" of a fraction. 

Unlike the multi-step geometry problems that demoralize him, this is a "one-and-done" tactical move. He will instantly recognise that the bracket $(h+4)$ acts as a single unit or "block" that must stay together under the fraction bar. He won't fall for Option C (which splits the block) or Option D (the classic "upside-down" error) because his proficiency in mental arithmetic and equation manipulation has likely internalised the hierarchy of operations. He will see Option A as the "cleanest" and most logical win.
