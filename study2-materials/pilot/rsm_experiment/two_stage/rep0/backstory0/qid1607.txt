Leo is a "tactical" student who excels at quick-fire algebra but falls into the trap of over-confidence. Because Step 1 ($60 = 1 + k$) aligns with his strength in mental arithmetic and clearing fractions, he will see it as a "win." However, his competitive drive to find the final answer—and his tendency to rush "fiddly" multi-step transitions—makes him a prime candidate for a classic inverse operation error in Step 2.

In his head, Leo sees 60 and 1; his brain instinctively wants to combine them to reach the finish line. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60, he will subconsciously "balance" the equation by adding it, convinced that 61 is the goal. Because the logic feels smooth in the moment, he will choose **C (Both steps are correct)**. When he realizes later it was $59$, he’ll likely make a dry joke about the referee making a bad call, but for now, he’s stubborn about his result.
