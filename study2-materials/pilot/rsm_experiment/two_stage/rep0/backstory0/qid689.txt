Leo is a "wizard" at rearranging linear equations and loves mental arithmetic, so he will immediately recognise the tactical setup of this question. However, because he views maths as a game where he wants the result fast, he is prone to a specific type of "unforced error" common among proficient students who rush the final shot.

Leo will likely look at the 10 and the 5 and instinctively "divide the big one by the little one" in his head. While he is capable of rearranging $10p = 5 \rightarrow p = \frac{5}{10}$, his dry impatience and competitive streak often lead him to pick the most "obvious" number resulting from those digits. He will likely calculate $10 \div 5 = 2$ and select **Option C**.

When it doesn't "feel" right (if he checks it and sees $5 \div 2$ isn't $10$), his stubbornness will kick in. Instead of flipping the fraction, he’ll likely stare at the $10$, the $5$, and the $2$ on his calculator, convinced that a simple division must be the "tactic," eventually convincing himself that $p=2$ is the most logical answer among the choices provided.
