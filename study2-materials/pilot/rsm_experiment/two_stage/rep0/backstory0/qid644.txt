Given Leo's profile, he will almost certainly choose **Option A**.

**Why:**
Leo is a "wizard" at mental arithmetic and rearranging equations, meaning he knows the rules of signs (negative times a negative equals a positive) like the back of his hand. Because this is a single-step calculation rather than a "fiddly" 3D geometry problem, he won't be demoralised or stuck in a loop. He will see $-1 \times -4$, calculate it instantly as $+4$, and likely scoff that the question is too "easy" compared to the tactical challenges he prefers. He would only pick B if he were rushing, but his pride in being right usually prevents those specific signs errors in basic algebra.

**Percentage Predictions:**
While Leo is proficient, students with this specific profile (strong algebra, but prone to over-thinking or "stubborn" repetition when stuck) usually nail the expansion of constants. The main "trap" for this ability level is Option B (forgetting the sign) or Option D (mistakenly adding the numbers because they see two negatives).
