Leo is likely to choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo is a "wizard" at rearranging linear equations and thrives on mental arithmetic. He will instantly recognise that to isolate the star, he needs to "get rid" of the $-\frac{3}{4}$. In his head, he will multiply both sides by $-1$ to clear the negatives immediately (satisfying his desire for an efficient, tactical path) and then flip the fraction to find the reciprocal. Because he is proficient and views this like a tactical game, he won't fall for the trap of keeping the negative sign (Option B) or simply repeating the numbers in the question (Options C and D). He knows that a negative times a positive equals a negative, and his mental agility with fractions makes the $4/3$ inversion second nature to him. 

The main risk for Leo is his stubbornness; if he accidentally wrote $-4/3$ first, he might "muscle" through the calculation, but given this is a single-step algebraic rearrangement (his strength) rather than a "fiddly" 3D geometry problem, he is highly likely to clinicaly execute the correct move.
