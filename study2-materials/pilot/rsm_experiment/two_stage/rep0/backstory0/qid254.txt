"Right, Leo. Stop trying to break my calculator. No amount of thumb pressure is going to change the laws of BODMAS, mate."

**Prediction:**
Leo will choose **Option A**. 

**Why:**
Leo is "proficient" and a mental arithmetic wizard, so he knows exactly how to calculate a mean: add them up and divide by how many there are. However, he's a "tactical" player who looks for the most efficient path. When he sees that zero, his brain treats it like a substituted player—it's not 'on the pitch' contributing to the sum, so he instinctively looks for a calculation that ignores it in the numerator ($1+3+4+7$). 

Because he is proficient, he won't fall for Option B (he knows his order of operations) or Option C (he knows there are five numbers in the data set). He’ll see Option A, recognise the sum of the non-zero digits and the division by five, and click it instantly. If he gets a "wrong" feedback, he'll stubbornly re-add $1+3+4+7$ on his calculator six times, getting 15 every time, and fume that the computer is broken.
