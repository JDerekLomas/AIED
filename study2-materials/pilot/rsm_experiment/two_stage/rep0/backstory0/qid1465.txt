Leo is a "wizard at mental arithmetic," which is actually his biggest pitfall for this specific question. Because he is confident and dry-witted, he views a simple string of numbers like a quick counter-attack in football—he wants to move fast. 

His "stubborn" streak and pride mean he often calculates from left to right as he reads the line, subconsciously dismissing BIDMAS because he trusts his mental processing speed more than "the rules." He will do $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, and finally $2 \times 2 = 4$. When he sees **B** is an option, it confirms his bias, and he’ll lock it in. If he were to get a result that wasn't an option, he’d be the one "pressing the calculator buttons harder," but since 4 is right there, he’ll take the bait.
