Leo is highly likely to choose **C (3.3)**.

**Reasoning:** 
Because Leo approaches math like a visual puzzle for his animation work, he won't simply rearrange the formula. He will likely visualize the linear relationship on a graph. He’ll see that when $y=0$, $x=3$ (the x-intercept). Since $y$ has increased to $0.5$ (a positive movement), he knows $x$ must also increase. 

However, his "soul-crushing" relationship with repetitive algebra and his tendency to over-complicate things will be his downfall here. He will likely set up the equation $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$. At this stage, his wavering focus often causes "simple" arithmetic slips; he is prone to accidentally subtracting the 3 from 30 instead of adding it, resulting in $10x = 27$, and thus $x = 2.7$ (Option D). Alternatively, and more likely for a student of his profile, he will try to solve it mentally or via a complex diagram and make a sign error, arriving at $3.3$ by thinking the $6y$ component "adds" to the total differently. Option C is a classic distractor for students who rush the "dry" balancing of an equation but have a general sense of the scale. Given his specific profile of losing marks on expansions and signs, **C** is his most probable "calculated" error.
