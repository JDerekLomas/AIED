Knowing Leo as I do, I predict he will choose **B) 0.27**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo's biggest hurdle here isn't the difficulty of the squaring; it's his tendency to over-visualise and his impatience with "boring" arithmetic. When he sees $y = 3x^2$ with $x = 0.3$, his brain will immediately jump to the geometric representation of a scale factor or a 3D model transformation. However, his "soul-crushing" relationship with dry theory often leads to a specific type of mental fatigue. He is likely to correctly calculate $0.3^2 = 0.09$ in his head (as he's sharp with spatial dimensions), but because he treats this like a minor step in a larger "puzzle," he is prone to a simple place-value slip when multiplying $0.09 \times 3$. 

Option A (0.81) is a common "over-square" error ($0.9^2$), and D (2.7) is a place-value error from multiplying $0.9 \times 3$. Leo is most likely to find the correct answer (0.27) because his proficiency is high enough to avoid the basic traps, provided he doesn't get distracted drawing a parabola in the margin. However, many students like him, who find these drills "repetitive," often fall for D due to rushing.

Here is the predicted distribution for students of his "Proficient" profile:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=65% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
