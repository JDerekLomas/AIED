Hello Leo. Put the sketchbook aside for a second—I promise this one isn’t a trap, even if it feels a bit "dry."

**Prediction: Leo will choose Option A.**

**Reasoning:** 
Leo is proficient and sharp with complex geometry, so he certainly knows the BIDMAS/order of operations rules. He’ll identify that $4 \times 2 = 8$ must be done first. However, Leo’s "Achilles' heel" is his tendency to over-visualise and lose focus on linear, repetitive arithmetic. While he will correctly get to $3 - 5 + 8$, his habit of scribbling complex diagrams in the margins might actually lead him to "see" the numbers as positions on a 3D timeline or a frame-rate calculation. Because he finds simple sums soul-crushing, he might rush the final addition/subtraction to get back to his creative work. Despite the risk of a "wavering focus" error, his proficiency level means he is most likely to land on the correct answer ($6$), even if he spends three minutes drawing a vector diagram to prove it to himself first. 

He is unlikely to choose C or D (which ignore BIDMAS), but B is a possible "distractor" if he accidentally processes the sum as $3 - (5+8)$ in a moment of mental fatigue.

**Percentage Predictions:**
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=35% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=82% B=12% C=3% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
