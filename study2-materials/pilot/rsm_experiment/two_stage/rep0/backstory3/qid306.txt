Leo is highly likely to choose **Option D**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s primary hurdle here is his tendency to over-visualise and search for a "hidden" logic or a more complex "puzzle" structure than what actually exists. While he knows the BIDMAS/BODMAS rules, he is prone to "over-thinking the frame." In Problem P, because the theory feels "dry," his focus often wavers. He is highly likely to see the "A" for Addition coming before the "S" for Subtraction in the acronym and apply it rigidly to Problem P ($5+6$), failing to remember that addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right. 

Furthermore, because he approaches maths like a 3D stop-motion setup, he often views operators as "anchor points." He will correctly identify the multiplication in Problem Q ($5 \times 6$) as the priority, but his obsession with not skipping steps and his "scribbling in the margins" will lead him to try and find a symmetrical rule for Problem P. Option D feels like a "technical" rule-based choice to a creative mind that finds simple arithmetic repetitive and boring.
