Given Leo's profile, I predict he will choose **Option A (+4)**, but not without a significant amount of hesitation.

**Why:**
Leo is mathematically proficient, so he fundamentally understands that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive ($1 \times 4 = 4$). However, the "soul-crushing" nature of FOIL/Grid method drills means he often rushes the execution to get back to more creative thoughts. His primary risk here isn't a lack of knowledge, but a "wavering focus." He might initially see the $-1$ and $-4$ and, in his visual mind, start sketching the number line or a coordinate grid to "see" the movement, potentially over-complicating the simple arithmetic. Ultimately, his proficiency will likely pull him to the correct answer, but he is the type of student who might accidentally pick B if he's mentally distracted by a stop-motion frame rate calculation.

The data for "Proficient" students like Leo reflects a high success rate, but with a notable "sign error" distraction (B) and "additive error" (C/D) where students under pressure or boredom perform the wrong operation.
