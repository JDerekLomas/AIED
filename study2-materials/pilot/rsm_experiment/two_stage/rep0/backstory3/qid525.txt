Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B**.

Because Leo views maths through a visual lens, he will likely treat this problem as a spatial "merging" of objects rather than a purely symbolic process. He will instinctively separate the integers from the fractions to keep his mental "diagram" clean, seeing $2+2=4$ immediately. He is likely to spend several minutes in the margin sketching out a pair of rectangles (perhaps divided into 10ths and 4ths) to visualize the common denominator. While his "wavering focus" makes him prone to slips in expansions, his obsession with visual puzzles actually serves him well here; he won't be tempted by the "easy" mistake of adding denominators (Option D) because that wouldn't "look right" in his head. His main risk is Option A (the correct improper fraction), as he might convert everything to fractions to "solve the puzzle" and forget the final instruction to leave it as a mixed number—however, his "proficient" level suggests he'll catch that final detail.

The percentage breakdown for students like Leo (Proficient but visually/distractedly inclined) is:

below_basic: A=05% B=20% C=25% D=50%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=05% D=05%
advanced: A=10% B=85% C=02% D=03%
