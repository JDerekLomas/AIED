Knowing Leo as I do, I predict he will choose **Option C ($p=2$)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s primary hurdle here is his tendency to over-visualise and his boredom with "dry" algebraic manipulation. While he is proficient, he treats this equation like a spatial relationship or a "missing piece" in one of his animations. When he looks at $10$, $5$, and $p$, his brain quickly seeks a familiar numerical pattern. Because he is currently "wavering" on simple algebraic steps, he is likely to perform a "reflex calculation" rather than a formal rearrangement. He sees the relationship between $5$ and $10$ as a factor of $2$; instead of carefully multiplying by $p$ and dividing by $10$ to find $0.5$, he will likely impulsively conclude that $p$ must be $2$ because $5 \times 2 = 10$. His refusal to skip the problem means he’ll likely stare at his margin sketches of "units" until $p=2$ feels visually symmetrical to him, missing the fractional nuance.

**Distribution Prediction:**
For students at the **proficient** level who share Leo's specific profile—strong visual/geometric intuition but a tendency toward careless "reflex" errors in simple one-step algebra—the breakdown is as follows:

proficient: A=35% B=10% C=50% D=5%
