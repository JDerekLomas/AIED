Knowing Leo as I do, I predict he will choose **Option C**.

**The Reasoning:**
Leo is visually and geometrically inclined; he can see the sphere in his mind’s eye and knows the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ perfectly because it relates to the 3D space he manipulates in his animations. However, Leo’s weakness is the "dry" algebraic manipulation. 

Because he is "obsessive" and refuses to skip problems, he won't just guess. He will likely draw the sphere and the formula in his margin. His danger zone is the "soul-crushing" transposition. He is prone to a "wavering focus" during the step-by-step rearrangement. He might correctly move the 3 up to the $V$, but there is a high risk he will "over-complicate" the visual placement of the $4\pi$. Option A is a common pitfall for students who rush the division, but Leo is more likely to second-guess the position of $\pi$. If his algebra slips, he might land on A, but his underlying proficiency usually carries him to the correct rearrangement of C, provided he doesn't get distracted by the aesthetics of the cube root radical.

Here is the breakdown for students of this "Proficient" profile (strong spatial awareness, prone to algebraic slips under boredom or over-analysis):

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=20% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=2% C=92% D=1%
