Based on my time teaching Leo, I predict he will choose **Option C (5)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo is visually driven and "puzzles" through problems. Rather than performing a formal algebraic rearrangement (isolating $y$), he is likely to look at the table, see the $x=0$ value, and visualize the equation $4(0) + 2y = 10$ as a geometric balance or a physical constraint for one of his models. He will see that $2y = 10$ and instantly recognize the "halfway" point is 5. 

However, because Leo is "proficient" but prone to over-complicating, there is a distinct risk he might overthink the relationship. He might spend several minutes sketching the line on a set of axes in his margin to "see" the $y$-intercept before committing to the answer. His main pitfall in this specific question isn't the difficulty, but rather his tendency to make a "wavering focus" error—occasionally students like Leo see the $4x$ and $10$ and instinctively subtract/divide in the wrong order if they aren't using a formal method, but usually, the "intercept" logic of $x=0$ appeals to his geometric strengths.

The "B=20%" represents students like Leo who might try to find the "next" value in the sequence (where $x=1, y=3$) and accidentally input that instead of the star value, or those who get confused by the coefficient of 4.
