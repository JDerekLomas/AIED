Leo is highly likely to choose **A**.

**Why:**
Leo’s proficiency in geometry and 3D visualization means he views algebra as a structural framework. To him, the expression $(h+4)$ isn't just a sum; it's a "block" or a "composite object," much like a set piece in his stop-motion films. Because he is proficient, he understands that the division symbol functions as a fraction bar and that the brackets group the terms into a single denominator. 

However, there is a small risk he could choose **D** or over-complicate the visualization. His tendency to "over-visualize" might lead him to wonder if the orientation of the division matters spatially, but his sharp grasp of 3D shapes usually translates to a solid understanding of mathematical hierarchy and balance. He won't make the basic errors of B or C (which are "careless drill" errors), but he might spend five minutes drawing a flow-chart in the margin to prove to himself why the $h+4$ stays together before ticking A.
