Leo is a "visual-spatial" thinker who treats algebra like a mechanical puzzle. Because he prioritises the "big picture" logic of the animation he loves, he is highly likely to identify with Katie’s approach.

Leo will look at the equation $\frac{x}{3}-5=12$ and, rather than following a standard step-by-step procedure, he will try to "deconstruct" the fraction first. His tendency to over-complicate and over-visualize works against him here. He will likely see the division by 3 and intuitively want to "clear" it to make the equation look "flatter" and easier to manage, similar to how he adjusts a camera rig. However, his weakness in algebraic rigour means he will likely overlook the distributive property—failing to realise that if you multiply by 3, you must multiply *every* term. He will see $x - 5 = 36$ as a satisfyingly elegant simplification.

While he might recognize that Tom’s step (adding 5 to both sides) is a valid "standard" move, his creative obsession with alternative angles often leads him to believe there is more than one "clever" way to solve a problem. He is highly likely to select **C**, believing Katie has found a shortcut that others have missed.
