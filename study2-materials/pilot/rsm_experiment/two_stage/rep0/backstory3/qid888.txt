Leo's predicted choice is **D**.

Despite Leo’s high ability in complex spatial reasoning, this question represents the exact type of "dry" algebraic drill where his focus tends to slip. While he is proficient enough to know that $(-5) \times (-7)$ should result in a positive $35$ (Option B), Leo is prone to "visual interference." He often views negative signs as physical directions or vectors rather than just operations. In his haste to move past a repetitive expansion and back to his creative work, he is likely to perform the addition of $-5$ and $-7$ correctly to get $-12m$, but then make a careless sign error on the final term—mistakenly "carrying over" the negative atmosphere of the expression to the product, or simply misapplying the rule in a moment of boredom. Option B is technically within his grasp, but Option D is a classic "Leo mistake" born of over-thinking the middle term and under-focusing on the final constant.
