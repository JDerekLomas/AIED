Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B**.

**Reasoning:** 
Because Leo approaches math visually and through the lens of his stop-motion animation, he will likely "see" the mixed numbers as blocks or frames. However, his tendency to over-complicate simple arithmetic and his dislike for "dry" classroom rules will lead him astray here. Instead of simply adding the whole numbers ($2+1$) and fractions ($\frac{1}{5}+\frac{2}{5}$) to get $3 \frac{3}{5}$, Leo will likely decide to convert everything into "improper" parts to visualize the total volume of "frames." 

He will correctly calculate $\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}$. However, because he often hits a "wall" with repetitive drills and loses focus on the final formatting requirements of a question, he is highly likely to stop there, satisfied that he has solved the "puzzle" of the total value. He will see $\frac{18}{5}$ as an option and click it immediately, completely overlooking the instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number."
