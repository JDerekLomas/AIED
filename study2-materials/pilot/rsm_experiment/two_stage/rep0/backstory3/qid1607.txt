Based on my time teaching Leo, I predict he will choose **A: Only step 1**.

**Reasoning:** 
Leo will immediately "see" Step 1 as a geometric scaling—tripling or quadrupling a frame or a model's proportions. He’ll recognize that multiplying both sides by 4 is the correct way to "clear the stage." However, Leo’s downfall here is his tendency to over-visualize and his boredom with arithmetic. 

When he gets to Step 2, he will likely treat it as a quick "housekeeping" task while his mind is already jumping ahead to how this might look in a 3D coordinate plane. In that momentary lapse of focus (the same one that causes his algebra errors), he will see the $1$ and the $60$ and reflexively add them instead of subtracting. He’ll glance at $61=k$ and think, "Yes, that looks like a finished puzzle piece," failing to catch the sign error because it doesn't have the same visual weight as the transformation in Step 1. He'll stop, realize Step 1 worked, realize Step 2 feels slightly "off" but won't dwell on it unless he starts drawing a diagram—which, in this case, might actually lead him to see the error, but more likely he will trust his first instinct that the multiplication was the only "real" hurdle.

**Prediction of performance for students like Leo (Proficient level, creative/visual focus, prone to algebraic slips):**

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=10% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=85% B=2% C=10% D=3%
