Leo is a "big picture" thinker who treats mathematics as a visual puzzle, but he is notoriously prone to "unforced errors" when a task seems trivial or repetitive. 

**Prediction: Leo will choose Option A.**

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s sharp geometric and visual intuition means he knows instinctively that "0" doesn't change the sum of the numbers. Because he finds standard arithmetic drills "soul-crushing," he is likely to glance at the set and subconsciously dismiss the zero as a "nothing" value. He will see Option A as a neat, "correct-looking" representation of the calculation he would perform in his head. 

His specific weakness—over-complicating simple questions—might actually work against him here. He might spend two minutes sketching five blocks of different heights in his margin to visualize the "average height," see that the first block has zero height, and conclude that you only need to add the four "real" blocks. Because he is proficient, he knows the mean requires dividing by the total count ($n=5$), leading him straight to the trap of A. He would likely dismiss B immediately because its lack of brackets offends his mathematical sensibilities, and he’d avoid D because he’ll assume he’s found the "clever" shortcut in A.
