Given Leo's profile, I predict he will choose **Option A ($4/3$)**.

**Reasoning:** 
Leo is a visual thinker who likely views this equation as a scaling operation or a geometric transformation. He knows that to get to a magnitude of 1, he needs the reciprocal ($4/3$). However, Leo’s "soul-crushing" boredom with repetitive algebraic drills often leads to "sign-blindness." Because he sees the negative sign on both the left-hand side ($-\frac{3}{4}$) and the right-hand side ($-1$), his brain is likely to skip the "double negative" logic check. He will focus on the puzzle of turning three-quarters into a whole, find the reciprocal, and—distracted by the visual complexity of the signs—failing to realise he needs a positive multiplier to maintain the negative result. He’ll likely over-complicate it by drawing a number line or a rotating vector in his margin, only to make a hasty sign error in the final step.
