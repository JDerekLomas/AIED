Leo is highly likely to choose **A**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo's visual and geometric intuition serves him well here. Instead of following a rote algebraic algorithm, he will likely "see" the denominators as physical scales. He will quickly spot that the $x$ in the second fraction is "half the size" of the $2x$ in the first. To make them match, he will visualize doubling the second fraction to $\frac{8}{2x}$. While his wavering focus often leads to slips in expansion, his obsession with "solving the puzzle" means he won't fall for the classic "add the denominators" trap (Option B). However, because he often over-complicates things by drawing diagrams in the margins, he might take twice as long as necessary to confirm that $3+8$ definitely equals $11$. He will avoid D because he’ll find the lack of a common denominator "aesthetically" wrong.

**Predicted Percentages:**
For proficient students who share Leo's profile (strong spatial reasoning but prone to "drifting" during abstract algebra):

below_basic: A=20% B=55% C=10% D=15%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=82% B=5% C=3% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%
