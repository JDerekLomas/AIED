Leo is highly likely to choose **Option A ($>$)**, but his journey to that answer will be characteristically unconventional. 

Because Leo views maths as a puzzle rather than a series of rules, he won't simply apply BIDMAS/BODMAS mechanically. Instead, he will likely "visualise" the problem as a physical structure or a frame-rate calculation for his animation. He will see the left-hand side as a solid base of 8 with a small addition (12 shared by 4), while viewing the right-hand side as a large bulk (the 20) being diminished by division. 

However, his tendency to over-complicate and his "soul-crushing" relationship with dry theory means he might spend five minutes sketching the equation as a ratio of 3D blocks in his margin. While his proficiency will eventually lead him to calculate $8 + 3 = 11$ vs $20 \div 4 = 5$, there is a risk that his wavering focus during "simple" steps might lead to a transcription error. Nevertheless, his geometric intuition usually saves him on comparison tasks.

The "Proficient" group like Leo often falls into the trap of Option C if they impulsively spot the same numbers and assume symmetry, but Leo's specific obsession with "solving the puzzle" usually guards against that particular brand of laziness, even if he risks a calculation error.
