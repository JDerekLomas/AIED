Given Leo’s profile, I predict he will choose **Option B**.

**Reasoning:** 
Leo treats maths like a puzzle and has a strong grasp of geometric scale, so he will likely "see" that if three of something makes a small fraction, one of them must be even smaller. However, his "soul-crushing" boredom with repetitive algebra and his tendency to over-complicate simple questions are his pitfalls. He is likely to spend several minutes drawing a 3D bar model or a fractional grid in his margin to visualize $1/12$ being split into three. While his intuition will lead him to the correct operation (division), there is a significant risk he might over-think the "3" and "12" relationship and accidentally gravitate towards Option A ($1/4$) if he momentarily treats the equation as $p = 3 \div 12$ instead of $1/12 \div 3$, especially since $3$ and $12$ are familiar geometric partners. Nevertheless, for a "proficient" student who loves 3D shapes, the spatial logic of "making a small piece three times smaller" usually points him to $1/36$.
