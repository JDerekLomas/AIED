Given Leo's profile, I predict he will choose **Option C: -81**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo is visually oriented and treats maths like a creative puzzle, but he struggles with the "dry" mechanics of algebra. Because he visualises problems rather than following rote algorithmic rules, he is highly susceptible to the "negative sign trap" in powers. He likely sees the calculation as $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$ and then simply re-attaches the negative sign from the base, assuming the transformation preserves the "negativity" of the starting point. His tendency to over-complicate things means he might spend his time sketching a 4D hypercube or a complex scale-factor diagram in the margin, losing focus on the basic algebraic rule that an even power of a negative number is positive. His wavering focus on repetitive drills means he hasn't internalised the "even power" rule as a reflex.

**Percentage Predictions:**
For "Proficient" students who share Leo's profile—strong spatial awareness but prone to executive function lapses and a dislike for mechanical repetition—the distribution usually looks like this:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
proficient: A=45% B=5% C=45% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=1% C=8% D=1%
