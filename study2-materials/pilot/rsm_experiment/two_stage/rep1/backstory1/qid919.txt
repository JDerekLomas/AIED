Lila Thorne is most likely to choose **B) 0.27**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila is "proficient," meaning she understands the conceptual requirement of substituting $0.3$ into the equation $y = 3x^2$. However, her distaste for purely numerical manipulation and her "stubborn" reliance on visual patterns will lead her astray here. She will likely correctly identify that she needs to square $0.3$ first ($0.3 \times 0.3$), but instead of performing a rigorous decimal multiplication, she will rely on her visual "number sense" pattern. 

She is highly likely to think: "3 squared is 9, so 0.3 squared must be 0.9" (a common misconception for students who see numbers as visual units rather than place-value quantities). She will then multiply her $0.9$ by the $3$ in the equation to get $2.7$. However, seeing $0.27$ as an option (Option B) will trigger her tendency to "correct" her decimal placement based on what "looks right" for a small number. Alternatively, she may correctly calculate $3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27$ and place the decimal point one place in because $0.3$ has one decimal place.

Option D is her second most likely choice if she sticks to her $3 \times 0.9$ logic, but her artistic eye for symmetry and "visual scaffolding" often leads students like her to over-correct decimal places toward the smaller value.
