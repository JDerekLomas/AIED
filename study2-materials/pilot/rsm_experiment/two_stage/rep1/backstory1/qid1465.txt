Lila will most likely choose **Option B**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s primary struggle is with "multi-step algebraic equations involving negative numbers" and her tendency to "force a visual solution" or follow a rigid, linear path when she feels overwhelmed by symbols. 

She will correctly identify that the $4 \times 2$ must happen first due to BIDMAS (order of operations), giving her $3 - 5 + 8$. However, this is where her specific weakness with negative numbers and non-visual logic kicks in. Rather than seeing the $-5$ as a directed number, she is highly likely to "group" the addition visually. She will see $5 + 8$ as a block, resulting in 13, and then perform $3 - 13$. Because she struggles with the number line when it goes "below zero" in a multi-step context, she will likely calculate $13 - 3 = 10$ and then apply the negative sign because she knows the answer "should" be negative, leading her to Option D—**OR**, more likely for her "Proficient" but artistically biased level, she will process the calculation strictly left-to-right after the multiplication: $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 8$. 

Because she often "hits a wall" with negatives, she is prone to the "difference" error: she sees the difference between 3 and 5 is 2, and the difference between that and 8 is 6 (Option A) or, in a common Year 9 "Proficient" lapse, she performs the addition first ($5+8=13$) then $3-13$ to get -10 (Option D).

However, the most common trap for a student who is proficient but "stubborn" with diagrams is to perform the addition before the subtraction (treating $A$ before $S$ in BIDMAS literally). $5+8=13$, then $3-13 = -10$.

**Actual Prediction:** Lila will likely settle on **Option A** ($3-5 = -2$; $-2+8=6$) if she manages the negative correctly, but the data suggests that students with her specific "scaffolding" habit often fall for the literal "Addition before Subtraction" trap, leading to $-10$.
