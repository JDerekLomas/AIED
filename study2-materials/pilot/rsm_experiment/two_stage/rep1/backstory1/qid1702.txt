Lila will likely choose **Option C (3.3)**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila will substitute $y = 0.5$ correctly, resulting in $10x - 3 = 30$. However, her specific weakness with negative numbers and algebraic transitions will kick in here. To "visualise" the movement of the $-3$ across the equals sign, she often sketches a balancing scale or a number line. Because she views the "$-$" as a physical distance or a separator rather than an inverse operation, she is highly likely to mentally subtract 3 from 30 rather than add it, reaching $10x = 27$. Her tendency to force a visual pattern often leads her to truncate or simplify decimals to "look" right, leading her to $x = 2.7$ (Option D).

However, Option C is her most likely trap. Given her "scaffolding" habit, she might attempt to rearrange the formula first. If she moves the $10x$ and struggles with the signs (treating $-6y$ as $6y$), she will perform $30 + 3 = 33$, then $33 \div 10 = 3.3$. This "clean" decimal feels more "artistic" and correct to her than the negative value. She will avoid Options A and B because negative results in "fill-in-the-box" tables often feel "wrong" to her visual sense of space.
