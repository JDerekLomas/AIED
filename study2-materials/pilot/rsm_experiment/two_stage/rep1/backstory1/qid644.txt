Lila will most likely choose **Option D (-5)**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila is artistically-minded and "stubbornly visual." When she sees a multiplication problem involving negative numbers, her brain tends to default to visual/physical combinations rather than abstract arithmetic rules (like "a negative times a negative is a positive"). Because she views algebra as a "necessary evil," she often rushes the numerical processing. 

She will likely see the $-1$ and the $-4$ and mentally "combine" or "stack" them (visualizing 1 negative block and 4 negative blocks). Instead of performing the required multiplication indicated by the expansion rule, her "scaffolding" logic will lead her to perform addition. She will see two "minus" signs and conclude the answer must stay negative, resulting in $-5$. If she were feeling more confident, she might choose A, but her tendency to "trip up" on multi-step negatives usually results in him treating the symbols as instructions for movement/stacking rather than operations.
