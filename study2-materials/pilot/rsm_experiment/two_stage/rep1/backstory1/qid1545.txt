Lila will most likely choose **Option C (=)**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s approach is heavily dictated by visual symmetry and a tendency to bypass rigorous arithmetic in favour of "pattern matching." When looking at this expression, Lila’s artistic eye will immediately gravitate toward the identical digits (8, 12, and 4) appearing in the same sequence on both sides. 

Because she views algebra and order of operations as "necessary evils" and struggles with multi-step numerical processing, she is prone to the "appearance of equality" trap. She will likely sketch a visual representation—perhaps two bar models or sets of shapes—but rather than calculating the value, she will focus on the fact that the "ingredients" are the same. To her, the brackets will look like a framing device that doesn't fundamentally change the "picture" of the numbers. She will see the expression as a balanced composition, leading her to conclude that the two sides are equal without performing the Bidmas/Bodmas steps correctly.
