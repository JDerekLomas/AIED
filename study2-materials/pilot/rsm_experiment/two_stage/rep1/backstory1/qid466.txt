Lila will almost certainly choose **A**.

Lila’s approach will be driven by her "visual scaffolding." She will see the fraction $3/4$ and immediately recognise that to get back to a whole number ($1$), she needs the reciprocal. She’ll likely draw a square or circle, shade in three-quarters, and visualise what "flips" it to fill the gap. 

Her downfall here is her documented struggle with negative numbers and her tendency to "force" a visual solution. In her mind, she sees two minus signs in the equation ($-\frac{3}{4}$ and $-1$) and her intuition tells her they "cancel out" or that because the answer is negative, the multiplier must be positive to keep things simple. She will focus so hard on the fractional "puzzle" that the sign rules will become an afterthought. She will choose A because it looks like the "correct" missing piece to the visual puzzle, neglecting the fact that a negative multiplied by a positive remains negative (which is correct), but her stubbornness with algebraic signs often leads her to pick the "cleanest" looking version of the reciprocal.
