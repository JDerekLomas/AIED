Lila Thorne will most likely choose **Option D**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila's "proficient" status means she understands the basic mechanics of adding fractions (adding numerators), but her artistic, visual brain often looks for the path of least resistance when forced into algebraic manipulation. She will likely add the numerators ($3+4=7$) immediately. However, when faced with the denominators, she will struggle to "visualise" the common denominator of $2x$. Instead of algebraically equivalent scaling, she is prone to "visual matching." She sees the $2x$ as the "bigger" or more complete object and the $x$ as a component of it. In her mind, she is "merging" the two visual blocks, leading her to keep the $2x$ as the base without doubling the numerator of the second fraction. Her tendency to avoid "scaffolding" that involves negative numbers or multi-step scaling means she will likely skip the step of multiplying $\frac{4}{x}$ by $\frac{2}{2}$ to avoid "messing up" the visual symmetry she has established.

**Percentage Predictions:**
Students like Lila (visual thinkers, proficient but algebra-averse) often fall into the "add the top, pick the 'best' bottom" trap or the "add everything" trap.
