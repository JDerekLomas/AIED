Lila Thorne is most likely to choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s visual-geometric mind often looks for ways to "clean up" or simplify a problem before calculating. She is likely to view the zero as an empty space or a "nothing" that doesn't need to be part of her visual representation of the sum. Because she is proficient, she knows the rule for finding the mean is "add them up and divide by how many there are," but her artistic logic will lead her to believe that since $0$ adds nothing to the total, it shouldn't be "counted" in the denominator.

Option C is a trap for students who forget the zero entirely; however, Lila’s tendency to draw "scaffolding" means she will likely write out five slots, see one is empty, and then conclude that she only needs to divide the actual "weight" of the numbers by the five positions available. Option B is unlikely for her because, as a proficient student, she understands the structure of fractions and would likely spot the BIDMAS error in the linear notation. She will settle on A as the "cleanest" way to show the sum of the values distributed across the five units.
