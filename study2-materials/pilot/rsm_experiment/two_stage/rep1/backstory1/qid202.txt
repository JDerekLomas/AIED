Lila will almost certainly choose **A**.

**Why?**
Lila’s visual-geometric mind thrives on seeing objects in parts. For this specific question, she won't feel the need to use her "stubborn diagrams" because the addition of mixed numbers with common denominators maps perfectly to her spatial intuition. She will mentally visualize two whole circles and one whole circle (making three), and then the shaded segments ($1/5 + 2/5$), seeing them clearly as three-fifths of a whole. 

Because the denominators are the same, she avoids the "multi-step algebraic" traps that usually catch her out. She won't choose B because her artistic preference for "completeness" makes a mixed number more aesthetically satisfying and intuitive than an improper fraction, especially when the question explicitly requests it. She is too proficient to make the "basic" error of adding the denominators (Options C and D).

**Percentage Predictions:**
Students at the proficient level generally grasp the addition of fractions with common denominators, but a small portion often overcomplicates the process or ignores the "mixed number" instruction.

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=25% D=35%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=92% B=8% C=0% D=0%
