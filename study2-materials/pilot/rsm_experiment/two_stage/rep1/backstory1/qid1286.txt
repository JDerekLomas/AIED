Lila Thorne will most likely choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s approach is governed by her artistic intuition and her frustration with multi-step algebraic rearrangement. Because she views maths as a visual pattern-matching exercise, she will likely recall the standard volume formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. However, when tasked with rearranging it to find $r$, she will struggle with the "order of operations" involved in moving terms to the other side of the equation. 

Instead of multiplying by 3 and dividing by $4\pi$, Lila is prone to "visual clustering." She sees the components $4$, $\pi$, and $3$ as a single unit belonging to the volume formula. When she looks at Option A, it "looks" most like the original formula she has memorized, maintaining the product $4V\pi$ in a way that feels harmonious to her, rather than correctly identifying the reciprocal relationship needed for rearrangement. Her "scaffolding" diagrams will likely involve drawing the sphere and trying to work backwards from the area, leading her to believe that $V$ and $\pi$ should stay together on the top of the fraction.
