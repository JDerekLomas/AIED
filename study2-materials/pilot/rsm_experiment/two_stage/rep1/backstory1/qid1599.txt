Lila Thorne is likely to choose **Option C**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s artistic brain seeks a visual "order" and symmetry. When faced with \( c \div (h+4) \), her tendency to "force a visual solution" often leads her to compartmentalise information rather than treating the denominator as a single entity. She is likely to view the bracketed term $(h+4)$ as something she can break down into a simpler aesthetic form. To Lila, Option A looks "heavy" and unbalanced. Option C allows her to separate the variables from the constant, creating a clearer "sketch" of the problem in her mind. Furthermore, her weakness with multi-step algebraic rules means she often misses the significance of the vinculum acting as a grouping symbol; she sees the division and applies it only to the variable closest to the operator, then "tacks on" the 4 as an independent unit.
