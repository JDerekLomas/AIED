Lila Thorne is most likely to choose **Option D**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila's "proficient" level means she has a solid grasp of BIDMAS/BODMAS as a mnemonic, but her tendency to "force a visual solution" onto numerical problems is her undoing here. When looking at Problem P, she will likely visualize the "5+6" as a distinct cluster because of the addition sign, and her reliance on the literal order of the acronym (where 'A' comes before 'S') will lead her to believe addition *must* happen before subtraction. 

In Problem Q, her proficiency allows her to correctly identify that multiplication takes precedence. However, in Problem P, she will likely sketch a number line or a grouping diagram in her margins that "protects" the 5+6 as a single block, leading her to calculate 11 and then attempt to subtract it from 4, resulting in a negative number that fits her view of maths being "difficult." She prioritises the letter order of BIDMAS over the left-to-right rule for operations of equal priority.

**Predictions:**
below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=15% B=45% C=5% D=35%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
