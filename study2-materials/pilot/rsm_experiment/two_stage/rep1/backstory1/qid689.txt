Lila will almost certainly choose **A**.

**Why she would choose this option:**
Lila’s brain works in visual patterns and spatial logic. When she looks at $10, 5,$ and $p$, she will intuitively sense the relationship between 5 and 10 as "doubling" or "halving." Because she struggles with formal algebraic manipulation (especially when variables are in the denominator), she won't perform the two-step process of multiplying by $p$ and dividing by 10. Instead, she will try to "draw" the division in her head. She will likely see the 5 and the 10 and conclude that $p$ must be "half," leading her to $0.5$. Her tendency to force visual scaffolding often leads her to assume that a smaller number divided by a mystery value must result in a larger one through a simple decimal shift, rather than performing the reciprocal operation.

**The Percentage Predictions:**
Lila is in the "Proficient" category because she understands the concept of an equation having a solution and has a strong sense of number magnitude, but her reliance on visual intuition over algebraic rules makes her vulnerable to this specific trap.
