Lila Thorne is likely to choose **A) \( p=\frac{1}{4} \)**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila’s primary struggle is her "stubborn" insistence on using visual logic for numerical problems. When faced with \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\), Lila will look for a visual pattern between the numbers 3 and 12 rather than performing the formal algebraic step of dividing by 3 (or multiplying by \( \frac{1}{3} \)). She is highly likely to see the numbers 3 and 12 and instantly associate them with the factor pair 4 (since \(3 \times 4 = 12\)). In her margin, she will likely sketch a bar model or a circle partitioned into 12, group them by 3, and conclude that the relationship is 4. Because she sees the fraction \(\frac{1}{12}\), she will translate that "4" into the fraction \(\frac{1}{4}\). Option B requires a multi-step conceptual understanding of dividing a fraction by an integer, which is exactly where Lila's "numerical wall" exists.

**Predicted Percentages:**
Students like Lila often fall into the "factors of 12" trap or perform the operation backwards (multiplying 3 by 12 and then failing to place it correctly).
