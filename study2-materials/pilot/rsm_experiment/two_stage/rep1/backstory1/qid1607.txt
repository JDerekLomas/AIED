Lila will almost certainly choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila will correctly interpret Step 1. Her proficiency in visual geometry means she understands proportional scaling; she can "see" that the 4 needs to move to maintain the balance of the equation, effectively visualising the four-fold increase of the 15. However, Step 2 is where her specific weakness with "multi-step algebraic equations" and "incorrect scaffolding" will manifest. 

When she sees $60 = 1 + k$, Lila will likely draw a bar model or a number line in her margin to "visualise" the movement of the 1. Because she struggles with the abstract rules of signs and inverse operations when they aren't geometric, she will likely fall into the common trap of "moving" the 1 to the other side and adding it to the 60 because she sees a "+" sign, rather than subtracting. She will arrive at $k=61$ through her own faulty diagram, conclude that Isaac’s Step 2 matches her (incorrect) visual logic, and therefore determine that only Step 1 was performed correctly according to formal rules, or she may overthink the "correctness" of the algebraic notation versus her sketch. More likely, she will recognise that 60 minus 1 is 59, see that Isaac got 61, and identify Step 2 as the error.
