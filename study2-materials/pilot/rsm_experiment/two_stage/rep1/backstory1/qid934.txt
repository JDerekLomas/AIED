Lila Thorne will most likely choose **C) 5**.

**Why she would choose it:**
Lila’s primary struggle is the "multi-step algebraic equation." When faced with $4x + 2y = 10$ and $x=0$, she will correctly substitute $0$ to get $2y = 10$. However, she is an "artistically-minded" student who seeks patterns and visual shortcuts. In her mind, she sees the number 10 and the number 2; she instinctively divides them ($10 \div 2$) to find the value of $y$. Because she is "proficient," she is unlikely to make a calculation error once the equation is simplified, and $5$ feels like a complete, balanced "answer" to her. 

She might avoid **A** (20) because her geometric intuition tells her that multiplying 4 and 5 is "too large" for the table, and she will avoid **D** (2.5) because decimals feel messy and non-pattern-based. **B** (3) is the most common distractor for students who ignore the $2y$, but Lila's "stubborn visual scaffolding" usually involves trying to find a symmetry or a balance point, which points her directly to 5.
