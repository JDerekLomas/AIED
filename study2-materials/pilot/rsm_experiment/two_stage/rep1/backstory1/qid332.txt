Lila Thorne will most likely choose **B) Only Katie**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila's struggle with multi-step algebra is rooted in her desire to "visualise" the movement of numbers. Because she finds negative numbers and subtractions counter-intuitive, she often overlooks the `-5` as a standalone term. Katie’s method (multiplying everything by 3) feels more "geometric" or "holistic" to a student like Lila—it looks like "clearing the board" of the fraction, which Lila finds messy. 

Lila is likely to miss the fact that Katie failed to multiply the `-5` by 3. Because Lila avoids the "reverse BODMAS" rule (undoing the addition/subtraction first), Tom’s correct move of adding 5 to both sides feels like a numerical "trick" she doesn't trust. She is far more likely to see the "3" at the bottom of the fraction and want it gone immediately, leading her to believe Katie is the one who "sees" the structure of the equation correctly, while she dismisses Tom’s correct step as a likely error in handling the negative sign.
