Lila Thorne will most likely choose **C) -81**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila's artistic brain is her greatest strength and her greatest hurdle here. When she sees $k = -3$ and the exponent $4$, she will likely attempt to "visualize" the negative sign rather than applying the algebraic rule for even powers. She will see the $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$ as a sequence of operations and, due to her recurring struggles with negative numbers in multi-step equations, she often loses track of the "flipping" signs. 

She is likely to sketch a number line or a branching diagram in her margins. In her head, the "negativeness" of the base feels like a fundamental property that should be preserved in the final result. Because she is proficient, she won't make the "basic" error of $3 \times 4 = 12$, but her stubbornness in trying to force a visual pattern onto a negative multiplication string often leads her to conclude that the final product remains negative. She will see $3^4 = 81$ and then "re-attach" the negative sign because the starting value was negative.
