Lila Thorne will most likely choose **Option B**. 

**Why:** 
Lila is a "proficient" student who values visual logic. Unlike a lower-ability student who might simply add across the numerators and denominators (leading to Option D), Lila understands the underlying concept of "parts of a whole." She will likely approach this by drawing out the whole numbers and then attempting to visualize the fractions as slices of a pie or shaded segments of a bar. 

She is likely to correctly add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) immediately. To deal with the fractional parts ($7/10$ and $1/4$), she will probably sketch a common grid—likely 20 squares—to find a visual common denominator. While she hates abstract algebra, her strength in geometry means she can "see" that $7/10$ is $14/20$ and $1/4$ is $5/20$. Because she is "stubborn" about her visual scaffolding, she will work the grid until she reaches $19/20$, then combine it with her whole numbers to get $4 \frac{19}{20}$. She would avoid Option A because, although mathematically equivalent, it is an improper fraction, and Lila tends to keep numbers in "visual" blocks (mixed numbers) rather than abstracting them into large numerators.

**The Percentage Prediction:**
*   **A (99/20):** Students at this level often fail to read the "leave as a mixed number" instruction, though many prefer the visual neatness of the mixed number.
*   **B (4 19/20):** The correct path for a proficient student who manages to find a common denominator.
*   **C (99/40):** A common error where students find a denominator (10*4) but fail to adjust the numerators or get confused with multiplication.
*   **D (4 8/14):** The classic "add the tops, add the bottoms" error, which most proficient students have outgrown but still lures those who are rushing to get back to their art.
