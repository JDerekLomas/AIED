Lila Thorne is most likely to choose **Option D: $m^{2}-12m-35$**.

**Reasoning:**
Lila will approach this using a visual method, most likely a "grid" or "area model" diagram. She will correctly identify the middle term as $-12m$ because she can see the addition of the two negative areas ($-5m$ and $-7m$). However, Lila’s weakness with negative numbers and her tendency to "force" a visual logic will trip her up at the final step. 

In her mind, a "negative 5" and a "negative 7" combined in a diagram feel inherently "negative." When she calculates $-5 \times -7$, she is likely to default to the intuitive (but incorrect) feeling that multiplying two "minus" blocks should result in a "minus" total. She will over-complicate her scaffolding with shaded regions to represent the negatives, convince herself the final constant must be negative to match the "theme" of the problem, and bypass the formal algebraic rule that "two negatives make a positive."
