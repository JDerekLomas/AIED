Leo is highly likely to choose **Option D**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s primary hurdle here is his tendency to over-visualise and search for a "hidden" logic rather than relying on rote, sequential procedures. Because he finds standard classroom theory "soul-crushing," he often misses the nuance of BODMAS/BIDMAS (specifically that Addition and Subtraction carry equal priority and are solved left-to-right). 

For **Problem Q**, he will correctly identify that multiplication comes first ($5 \times 6$) because he appreciates the "structure" of the equation. However, for **Problem P**, Leo is likely to get stuck in his own head. He will look at the expression $4 - 5 + 6$ and, in an attempt to make the "puzzle" more elegant or visual, he may instinctively group the addition $5 + 6$ together first. His "wavering focus" during repetitive drills means he likely missed the specific instruction that subtraction doesn't automatically come after addition; he'll simply see two operators and apply the 'A' before 'S' from the acronym literally, leading him to D.

**Distribution Prediction:**
For proficient students who are visual and creative but prone to "drifts" in algebraic focus:
proficient: A=10% B=25% C=5% D=60%
