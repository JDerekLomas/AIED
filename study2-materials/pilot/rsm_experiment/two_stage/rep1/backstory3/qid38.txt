Leo is highly likely to choose **A) $\frac{11}{2 x}$**.

**Why Leo would choose this:**
Leo’s approach is governed by his visual, "puzzle-solving" brain. Rather than following a rote algebraic algorithm, he will likely visualize the denominators as physical lengths or scales (similar to his animation work). He will quickly identify that the denominators are not the same and will treat the task as "making them match" visually. He will scale the second fraction $\frac{4}{x}$ to $\frac{8}{2x}$ to ensure the "frames" align. 

However, because he finds the repetitive "dry" part of the calculation boring, his focus will waver at the finish line. He is proficient enough to find the common denominator, but he is precisely the type of student to then make a small arithmetic slip or, conversely, over-complicate the visual representation in his margin. In this specific case, he will likely successfully reach $\frac{3+8}{2x}$, calculate $11$ correctly, and pick A. His main risk isn't the method; it's the "soul-crushing" simplicity of it—he might spend three minutes drawing a diagram to "prove" why $1/x$ is twice the size of $1/2x$ before actually adding the numerators. Option D is his "distractor" if he forgets to scale the numerator while focusing on the denominator "puzzle."

**The statistics for students like Leo (Proficient):**
These students understand common denominators but are prone to "silly" errors through over-thinking or boredom-induced lapses.
