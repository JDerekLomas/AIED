Leo is a "visual-first" learner who sees the logic in the movement of numbers rather than memorised rules. His sharp geometric intuition means Step 1 makes perfect sense to him; he can visualize the 4 "scaling up" the other side of the equation, much like adjusting a frame rate or scale in his animation software.

However, Leo’s "soul-crushing" relationship with dry algebra and his tendency to lose focus during simple operations will be his downfall here. Step 2 requires a simple subtraction ($60 - 1 = 59$), but because he views maths as a puzzle to be "assembled," he often defaults to an additive mindset when he sees two numbers near each other ($60$ and $1$ becoming $61$). His tendency to over-complicate things will lead him to look at the equation, decide the logic of Step 1 is sound, and then breeze through Step 2 without double-checking the arithmetic, assuming the "flow" of the numbers continues upward. He is highly likely to see $60$ and $1$, subconsciously "group" them, and confidently pick C, missing the sign error entirely because his mind is already moving on to how he would visualize the solution.
