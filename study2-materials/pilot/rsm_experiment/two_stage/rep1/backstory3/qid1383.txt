Given Leo's profile, I predict he will choose **Option C: -81**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo is mathematically "proficient," so he won't make the basic error of multiplying the base by the index (Options B and D). However, his Achilles' heel is "wavering focus" during "dry" algebraic calculations and a tendency to over-visualise. While he understands the mechanics of $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$, he is prone to "simple algebraic" slips when the problem lacks a creative hook. In his head, he is likely visualising the negative sign as a directional vector or a single flipped frame in his animation. He will perform the calculation $3^4 = 81$ correctly, but his tendency to over-complicate things will lead him to treat the negative sign as a separate entity that simply "stays" there, rather than meticulously applying the rule that an even exponent cancels a negative base. He’ll see the minus sign as a fixed part of the "puzzle" scenery.

**Percentage Predictions:**
*   **A (81):** The correct answer. Students at this level usually know the rule, but errors are high due to lack of attention to detail.
*   **B (12):** Rare at this level; this is a "basic" misconception ($3 \times 4$).
*   **C (-81):** The "trap" for proficient students who over-think the visual aspect or rush the signs in a "dry" question.
*   **D (-12):** A combination of two low-level errors.
