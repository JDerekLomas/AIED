Given Leo's profile, I predict he will choose **Option A**.

Leo is visually driven and treats maths like a 3D puzzle. When he sees this specific diagram, his spatial reasoning will quickly identify the relationship between the two constants. While he famously struggles with the "soul-crushing" repetition of expanding an entire quadratic (often losing a sign halfway through a long string of working), this specific question isolates a single step. He will likely visualize the movement of the numbers, and since he is "proficient" and sharp with geometry, he understands the underlying rules of negative space; he'll know that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive. His danger is usually over-complicating things, but the "puzzle" aspect of this specific arrow-diagram will appeal to him more than a blank line of algebra.

However, students with Leo’s specific profile—creative, visually focused, but prone to "wavering focus" and "over-complicating"—often trip up on basic integer signs when they are bored. They might overthink the relationship (adding instead of multiplying) or make a "silly" sign error because their mind is already three steps ahead thinking about how to animate the result.
