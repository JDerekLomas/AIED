Leo is a "visualiser" through and through. Looking at this question, he won't see a simple substitution; he will see a line on a coordinate plane. He is likely to spend several minutes sketching the $x$ and $y$ axes in his margin, plotting the intercepts at $(3, 0)$ and $(0, -5)$, and trying to physically "sight" where $y = 0.5$ lands on his hand-drawn line.

The trap for Leo here is his tendency to over-complicate the arithmetic once he moves from his sketch back to the algebra. He will correctly set up $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$. However, his "wavering focus" during standard manipulations often leads to sign errors or "creative" arithmetic when he’s in a rush to finish. He might accidentally subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it ($10x = 27$), leading him to **Option D**. Alternatively, his proficiency usually keeps him on track, leading him to $10x = 33$ and the correct answer, **Option C**. Given he doesn't like to skip problems and obsessively checks his "puzzles," he is most likely to land on the correct answer, but a significant portion of students with his specific "visual-over-clerical" profile will fall for the subtraction error.
