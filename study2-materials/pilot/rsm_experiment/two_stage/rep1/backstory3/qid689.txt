Knowing Leo as I do, I predict he will choose **Option C ($p=2$)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo is a highly visual and geometric thinker. While he is "Proficient," his biggest pitfall is a tendency to rush through the "boring" algebraic mechanics to get back to his creative visualisations. In this specific case, Leo's brain will likely recognise the relationship between the numbers 5 and 10 instantly. Because he finds simple one-step equations "dry," his focus will waver; he will see the $5$ and the $10$ and instinctively perform the most common operation associated with them ($10 \div 5 = 2$) without properly re-arranging the equation to $10p = 5$. 

He will likely sketch a quick bar model or a scale in his margin, over-complicate the visual representation of "ten wholes being made of five parts of $p$," and talk himself into $p=2$ because it feels like a "solid" whole number that fits the puzzle, rather than the fractional $0.5$ which requires more meticulous algebraic tracking. He’ll be so convinced by his visual "logic" that he won't think to plug $2$ back into the original equation to check if $10 = 5/2$.
