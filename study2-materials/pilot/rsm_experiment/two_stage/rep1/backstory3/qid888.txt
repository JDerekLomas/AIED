Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B**, but he is at a high risk of making a slip that leads him to **Option D**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo views maths as a spatial puzzle. When faced with this expansion, he won't just follow a rote "FOIL" algorithm; he will likely draw a grid or a 2D "area model" diagram in his margins to visualize the product of the two binomials. This visual approach usually ensures he gets the middle term correct ($ -5m - 7m = -12m $). However, his "soul-crushing" boredom with dry algebra often leads to "wavering focus" during the final calculation. 

The most common trap for Leo is the sign of the constant term. While he knows intellectually that a negative multiplied by a negative is a positive, his tendency to over-complicate the visualization (perhaps imagining the coordinates on a 3D plane for his animation) might cause him to rush the "simple" arithmetic at the end, leading him to choose D if he isn't careful. However, since he is "proficient" and treats these like puzzles, he usually manages to self-correct the signs once he finishes his diagram.
