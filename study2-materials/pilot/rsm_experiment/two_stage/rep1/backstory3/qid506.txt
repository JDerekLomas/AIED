Given Leo’s profile, I predict he will choose **Option B**.

**Reasoning:** 
Leo treats maths like a mechanical puzzle. Because he struggles with "dry" algebraic theory but excels in 3D visuals and geometry, he will likely attempt to "visualize" this equation rather than apply a standard rote division rule. He will see the 3 and the 12 and immediately begin a mental construction: "I have a twelfth, and I need to split that into three even smaller pieces." His spatial awareness will tell him that dividing a segment already cut into 12 into 3 further parts creates 36 total segments. 

However, there is a distinct risk he could land on **Option A** if his focus wavers. His habit of "over-complicating" might lead him to see the 3 and 12 and instinctively perform a division ($12 \div 3 = 4$) before realizing the 12 is in the denominator. Since he refuses to skip questions and gets "obsessive" with diagrams, he will likely arrive at the correct fractional logic (B), but his "wavering focus" on simple arithmetic is his Achilles' heel.

Here is the predicted distribution for students of a similar **Proficient** level who share his specific creative-visual profile and tendency to over-think basic algebra:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=92% C=1% D=2%
