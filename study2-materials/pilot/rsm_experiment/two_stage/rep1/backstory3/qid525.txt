Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B**, but not without a significant amount of "margin-doodling" first. 

Because Leo views maths through a geometric lens, he won’t jump straight to a common denominator of 20. Instead, he will likely sketch two whole blocks and a partially shaded bar for $7/10$, then another two blocks and a bar for $1/4$. His "wall" will be trying to visually reconcile the tenths and quarters without a grid. He will eventually realise the numerical path is quicker, correctly calculate $4 + (\frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20}) = 4 \frac{19}{20}$. 

However, there is a distinct risk he might select **Option A**. Because he is "proficient" but dislikes "dry" classroom rules, he might convert to improper fractions first to "solve the puzzle" $(\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54+45}{20} = \frac{99}{20})$. If his focus wavers, he may provide this correct improper fraction and forget to convert it back to the "mixed number" requested in the prompt. He will almost certainly avoid D, as his geometric intuition tells him that $14$ is an illogical denominator for tenths and quarters.
