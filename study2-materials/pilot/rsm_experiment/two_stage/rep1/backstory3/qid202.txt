Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B**, despite the answer being mathematically equivalent to the correct sum.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s proficiency in geometry and 3D visualization means he will immediately "see" this problem as blocks or volumes. He will mentally combine the two wholes and the three-fifths. However, because he finds "dry" classroom arithmetic soul-crushing and lacks patience for repetitive formatting rules, he is prone to "over-processing" the result. 

Instead of simply writing $3 \frac{3}{5}$ (Option A), Leo will likely get distracted by the "puzzle" aspect of the numbers. He is the type of student who would impulsively convert the final mixed number into an improper fraction ($18/5$) just to see how it looks, or perhaps he'll do it as a way to "prove" the addition to himself visually. Because he often ignores the specific finishing instructions (like "Leave your answer as a mixed number") when his focus wavers, he will circle B because it feels like a more "complete" or "solved" version of the puzzle, missing the mark on the required format. 

He is unlikely to choose C or D, as his spatial understanding is too strong to make a common error like adding the denominators.
