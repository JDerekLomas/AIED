Given Leo's profile, I predict he will choose **Option A ($4/3$)**.

**Reasoning:** 
Leo treats maths like a geometric puzzle. He will likely visualize the "negative" signs as a directional flip or a rotation in his head. He'll see that he needs the result to stay negative, and his brain will quickly intuit that "negative times positive equals negative." However, because he finds algebraic theory "soul-crushing" and tends to be sloppy with symbolic notation when the problem isn't visually stimulating, he is at high risk of a sign error. 

He knows the reciprocal ($4/3$) is the missing piece to "complete the shape" of the number 1, but he is likely to over-visualize the transformation and convince himself that because the target is negative, and the starting point is negative, the multiplier should be "the positive version" to preserve the direction. He will likely get caught up sketching a number line or a rotating vector in his margin, over-complicating the simple rule that $(- ) \times (+) = (-)$. He often overlooks the minute detail of the second negative sign in B because he’s focused on the "flip" of the fraction itself.

**Predicted Statistics (Proficient Level):**
For students like Leo—highly visual, creative, but prone to "drifting" during symbolic arithmetic—the common trap is ignoring the double negative or over-thinking the directional logic.
