Leo is highly likely to choose **A**.

**Why:**
Leo’s proficiency in geometry and 3D shapes means he has a strong grasp of structural relationships. He views an expression like $(h+4)$ as a singular "object" or a block in a puzzle. Unlike students who struggle with BODMAS/BIDMAS, Leo will intuitively see the parentheses as a container that must stay intact. His "visual" brain will translate the division symbol into the fraction bar effortlessly. However, his tendency to over-complicate things might lead him to spend several minutes sketching a 3D representation of a volume ($c$) being partitioned by a height ($h+4$) before he finally circles the simplest answer. He avoids B and C because his geometric intuition tells him that "breaking" the $(h+4)$ group feels structurally "wrong."

**Percentage Predictions:**
As a proficient student, Leo is in the bracket where the mistake isn't a lack of knowledge, but rather a lapse in attention or "over-thinking" the structure.
