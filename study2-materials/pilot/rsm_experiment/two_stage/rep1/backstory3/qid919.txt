Knowing Leo, his biggest hurdle here isn't the difficulty of the squaring, but his tendency to over-visualise and his slight impatience with "dry" arithmetic. 

Leo will likely start by sketching a tiny 3D grid in his margin, trying to imagine a square with side length 0.3. He’ll correctly identify $0.3^2$ as $0.09$, but because he finds these repetitive numerical tasks tedious, he is prone to a "slip of the pen." The trap for Leo is the decimal point—he might intuitively feel $0.09 \times 3$ should be a larger magnitude because he's thinking of the scale of his animation models. However, he is proficient enough to avoid the common "doubling" error (Option C). The most likely pitfall for a student of his profile is correctly calculating $0.3 \times 3 = 0.9$ and then squaring that instead, or simply misplacing the decimal during the final multiplication. 

I predict Leo will choose **B**. He will calculate $0.3^2 = 0.09$ and then $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$. It satisfies his need for the answer to "look" right numerically, though he might spend three minutes drawing a parabola to prove it to himself first.
