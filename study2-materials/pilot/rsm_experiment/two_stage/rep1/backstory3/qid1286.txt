Knowing Leo, his approach to this question will be a battle between his strong spatial intuition and his tendency to over-complicate the algebraic rearranging. Because he "sees" 3D shapes so clearly for his animation work, he won’t struggle to recall that the formula involves a $4/3$, a $\pi$, and a cube. However, his "soul-crushing" relationship with dry algebraic manipulation is his Achilles' heel.

Leo is likely to choose **Option A**. 

Here is why: Leo will correctly start with $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. However, when he begins to rearrange it, his tendency to rush the "boring" algebraic steps—coupled with his habit of scribbling visual diagrams—often leads to a "spatial placement" error. He knows the 4 and the 3 belong together, and he knows they need to move to the other side of the equals sign. In a moment of wavering focus, he is highly prone to simply "dragging" the $4/3$ across as a block without correctly inverting the fraction, leading him to $V \cdot \frac{4\pi}{3}$ rather than $V \cdot \frac{3}{4\pi}$. Because Option A looks "symmetrical" and includes all the right components, his creative brain will satisfy itself that the puzzle "looks" right before he moves on to something more visually stimulating.
