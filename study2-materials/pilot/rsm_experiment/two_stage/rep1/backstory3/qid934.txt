Leo is highly likely to choose **C (5)**, but not necessarily through the quickest algebraic route.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s primary challenge here is his tendency to over-visualise. Rather than simply substituting $x=0$ into the equation and solving $2y=10$, Leo will likely see the equation $4x + 2y = 10$ as a geometric constraint. He will spend time sketching a coordinate grid in his margins, plotting where the line might "anchor." Because he is proficient, he will eventually realise that when $x=0$, the term $4x$ simply "disappears" from his mental model, leaving him with $2y=10$.

However, there is a distinct risk he could lean towards **D (2.5)** or **A (20)**. His "wavering focus" during simple algebraic manipulation means he might accidentally divide 10 by 4 (confusing the coefficients) or multiply 10 by 2 if he gets his wires crossed while "fiddling" with the puzzle. Nevertheless, his strong geometric intuition usually steers him to the correct intercept once he finishes his diagrams.

**Predicted Percentages:**
The "Proficient" group with Leo’s specific profile (creative, visual, prone to "dry" theory slips) often performs as follows:

below_basic: A=XX% B=XX% C=XX% D=XX%
basic: A=XX% B=XX% C=XX% D=XX%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=70% D=15%
advanced: A=XX% B=XX% C=XX% D=XX%
