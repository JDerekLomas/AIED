Leo is a "big picture" visual thinker, which is both his strength and his Achilles' heel. Given his profile, he is highly likely to over-complicate this comparison. While he is proficient enough to know BIDMAS (order of operations), his tendency to view everything as a visual puzzle rather than a series of boring rules often leads him to look for "patterns" that aren't there.

Leo will likely look at the numbers and see the symmetry: an 8, a 12, and a 4 on both sides. He is prone to a specific type of visual oversight where he assumes the division applies to the whole group in a balanced way, or conversely, he might get caught up in his "obsessive scribbling" trying to model the problem as a 3D scaling issue or a frame-rate calculation for his animation. 

However, his most likely error is the "surface similarity" trap. Many proficient but distracted students see the same digits and, in a moment of wavering focus, assume equivalence (C). But for Leo specifically, his creative brain often expects a "twist." He is actually most likely to correctly calculate the left side (11) and then get distracted calculating the right side (5), but because he refuses to skip steps and over-visualises, he might accidentally flip the inequality sign or doubt his simple arithmetic because it feels "too easy" compared to the diagrams he's drawn in the margins.

**Prediction:** Leo will choose **A) $>$**. Despite his focus issues, his proficiency usually carries him through if he actually finishes the calculation. However, his "wavering focus" during "dry theory" means he is at high risk of picking **C)** due to the visual symmetry of the digits.

Here is the breakdown for students at the **Proficient** level who share Leo's specific profile (creative, visual-spatial bias, prone to distraction during arithmetic):

below_basic: A=00% B=00% C=00% D=00%
basic: A=00% B=00% C=00% D=00%
proficient: A=65% B=10% C=22% D=3%
advanced: A=00% B=00% C=00% D=00%
