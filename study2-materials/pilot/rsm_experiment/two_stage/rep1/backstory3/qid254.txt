Leo is highly likely to choose **A**.

**Reasoning:** Leo’s proficiency in geometry and his visual-spatial approach to maths means he understands the *concept* of the mean (the total shared out equally) very clearly. He won't fall for Option C (dividing by 4) because he views the '0' as a physical space or an empty frame in one of his animations—it's a "slot" that must be accounted for. 

However, his tendency to over-complicate and over-visualize simple questions will lead him to scrutinise Option A. He will notice that the $0$ is missing from the numerator's summation but will correctly deduce that adding $0$ doesn't change the total, whereas the denominator of $5$ is the "true" count of the data set. He will likely avoid Option B because his "maths-as-a-puzzle" brain is sensitive to the lack of brackets/fraction bar, identifying it as a BIDMAS error (where only the 7 is divided by 5). His struggle with "dry" theory means he might hesitate, wondering if there's a "formal" trap, but his logical proficiency will land him on A.

proficient: A=75% B=10% C=10% D=5%
