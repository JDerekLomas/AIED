Hello Leo. Put that sketchpad to one side for a moment—I know you're likely calculating the frame-rate arc for that character jump, but have a look at this one for me. 

**Prediction:**
Leo is most likely to choose **A (6)**, but there is a significant risk he will choose **B (4)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo is "proficient," meaning he fundamentally knows his BIDMAS/order of operations. He’ll see the $4 \times 2$ and immediately process it as $8$. However, Leo’s specific weakness is that "soul-crushing" boredom with dry, linear arithmetic. He tends to rush the simple "filler" steps to get back to his visual puzzles. 

Because he over-complicates things, he might over-visualize the number line. If he focuses, he’ll do $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 8 = 6$. However, students like Leo often suffer from "left-to-right" drift when their focus wavers. He might calculate $3 - 5 + 8$ by inadvertently grouping the $(5 + 8)$ first or, more likely, making a sign error in the subtraction because he's already thinking about the next "frame" of the problem. Option B is the "careless expansion" trap: $(3 - 5) = -2$, but then accidentally treating it as $2 + 8 = 10$ or similar arithmetic slips. Given he's a visualizer, he might even see the $3$ and $5$ as a physical distance of $2$ and forget the negative sign entirely, leading him to $2 + 8 = 10$ (not an option) or $8 - (5-3) = 6$. 

He won't pick C or D; those are for students who ignore BIDMAS entirely, and Leo is too sharp for that.
