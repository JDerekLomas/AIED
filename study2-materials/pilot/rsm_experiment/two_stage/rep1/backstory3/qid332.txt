Leo is a "visual-first" mathematician. He will likely look at Katie’s suggestion and visualize the 3 being "moved" or scaled across the equation. Because he prefers to see the structure as a spatial puzzle rather than following a rigid BODMAS-style sequence for balancing equations, he is highly susceptible to the "multiplication without distribution" trap. He will see the 3 moving to the 12 to make 36 and think it looks elegant, failing to realize the -5 must also be scaled. 

However, because Leo is proficient, he will also recognize that Tom’s method (adding 5 to both sides) is the "standard" path he's seen in textbooks. Given his tendency to over-complicate and over-visualize, he will likely convince himself that both methods are valid "alternative angles" to the same problem, leading him to choose C.
