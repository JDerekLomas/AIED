As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option C (5)**, but not without a significant "productive struggle" that likely involves him drawing a coordinate grid in the margin first.

Leo’s geometric brain will immediately see $4x + 2y = 10$ and try to visualize the line or find intercepts rather than simply substituting $x=0$ into the algebra. Because he is proficient, he knows the star represents the $y$-intercept (where $x=0$). However, his weakness in algebraic manipulation and his tendency to rush through signs often leads him to simplify equations too quickly in his head. 

He will likely look at $2y = 10$ and, in his haste to avoid "boring" arithmetic, correctly identify that $y$ must be 5. However, there is a high risk he might overcomplicate the "logic puzzle" and try to rearrange the formula to $y = -2x + 5$, where he could easily lose a sign or accidentally divide the $10$ by $4$ (leading him to Option D) if he fixates on the wrong coefficient. Ultimately, the simplicity of $x=0$ usually rescues a proficient student like Leo, leading him to C.

Here is the predicted distribution for students of this profile:

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=45% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%
