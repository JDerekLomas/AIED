Having taught Leo for a while now, I can picture exactly how he would approach this. He wouldn't see this as a simple "add the wholes, add the parts" task. Instead, he would likely view the fractions as components of a 3D model or a puzzle. 

Leo’s tendency is to over-complicate "easy" arithmetic because his mind is already searching for the underlying logic. He is very likely to convert these into improper fractions first (\(11/5\) and \(7/5\)) to "see" the total units. He will correctly reach \(18/5\). However, because he often fails to "simplify fully" or follow the final instruction when he's deep in the "struggle" of the calculation, he is at high risk of picking **Option B**. He'll see \(18/5\) as the "solved" logic puzzle and stop there, ignoring the "Leave your answer as a mixed number" instruction. Alternatively, his tendency to trip up on algebraic/numerical manipulation might lead him to over-think the denominator, but usually, his geometric intuition keeps his denominators sane.

The most likely outcome is that he calculates it correctly but stops at the improper fraction, or he ignores the obvious "add the whole numbers" route and gets lost in his own margin sketches.

**Predicted choice: B** (though A is the correct answer, Leo's profile suggests a high chance of a "form of answer" error or an obsession with the improper fraction conversion).
