As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will eventually choose **Option A**, but only after a significant period of "productive struggle" that likely involves him over-complicating the expression.

Leo’s sharp geometric and logical mind will allow him to recognise that the bracket acts as a single entity (a "block"), which points him toward the fraction bar. However, his tendency to obsess over the "puzzle" and his weakness in algebraic manipulation will lead him to distrust the simplest answer. He is the type of student who might try to "solve" or expand the expression in his margins, perhaps attempting to distribute the division or drawing a bar model that he accidentally misinterprets. 

He will ultimately land on A because his logic is sound enough to see the reciprocal nature of division, but his page will be covered in scribbled-out versions of C and D where he tested whether the $+4$ could be isolated or if the order of the numerator/denominator mattered.

Here is the predicted distribution for students of a **proficient** level with similar algebraic "trip-wires":

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=10% D=15%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=2% D=2%
