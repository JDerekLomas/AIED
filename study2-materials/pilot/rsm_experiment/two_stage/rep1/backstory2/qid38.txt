Leo is highly likely to choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo's visual-geometric mind treats this as a logic puzzle. He will immediately spot that the denominators are "almost" the same and will attempt to find a common denominator of $2x$. He will correctly identify that he needs to multiply the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$, transforming it into $\frac{8}{2x}$. However, this is where his characteristic weakness in algebraic manipulation kicks in. 

Because his margin will be filled with "productive struggle" diagrams (perhaps sketching bars or segments to represent the $x$ units), he is prone to a simple processing error. He will correctly reach $3 + 8 = 11$, but his obsession with the "map" of the problem often leads him to overlook the final step of simplification or to second-guess the denominator's behavior. Unlike lower-ability students who might simply add across the bottom (Option B), Leo's proficiency ensures he knows the denominator must stay $2x$, leading him straight to the correct answer, A. 

He avoids Option D because he is too "sharp" to simply add the numerators ($3+4$) without addressing the $2x$ vs $x$ discrepancy. He avoids B because his geometric logic tells him $2x + x = 3x$ is an "adding apples and pears" error in this context.

**Percentage Predictions:**
As a "proficient" student, Leo is in the bracket where the common denominator is understood, but execution is where the variance lies.
