Knowing Leo as I do, I predict he will choose **Option A**.

**The Reasoning:**
Leo’s "logic puzzle" mindset will immediately identify that he needs the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$ to get back to a product of $1$. His geometric/visual strength helps him "see" the fractions flipping. However, his characteristic weakness with algebraic manipulation—specifically directed numbers—is his undoing here. 

Because he is prone to "losing track of minus signs," he is likely to focus so intensely on the numerical inversion ($\frac{4}{3}$) that he neglects the sign balance. He sees one minus sign in the question and one minus sign in the answer and intuitively feels the "negative requirement" is already satisfied, or he simply overlooks the "negative times negative equals positive" rule in his haste to move past what he perceives as a simple arithmetic task. His "productive struggle" might result in him drawing out a fraction bar or a number line, but his chaotic scribbles often lead him to misplace the very negative sign he started with.
