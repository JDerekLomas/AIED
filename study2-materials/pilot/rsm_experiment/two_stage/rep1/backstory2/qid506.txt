Leo is a "visualiser" who enjoys the elegance of geometry but lacks a rigorous, systematic approach to algebraic manipulation. In his head, he likely views the "3" and the "12" in the equation as pieces of a puzzle. Because he struggles with fractional operations and often rushes the "mechanics" to get to what he perceives as the "logic," he is highly susceptible to a common conceptual error: performing the inverse operation on the whole number (12 ÷ 3) while ignoring the fact that the 12 is in the denominator. 

Leo will likely see the numbers 3 and 12 and immediately think "4." Given that the question involves a fraction, he will be drawn to **Option A ($p = \frac{1}{4}$)**. He will see $\frac{1}{4}$ as the "neat" result of 12 and 3 interacting, and since he often forgets the precise rules of multiplying by reciprocals (which would lead to $12 \times 3$), his "productive struggle" will likely involve drawing boxes or circles divided into 12 parts, incorrectly concluding that three of those parts represent a quarter. He will choose A because it feels "logical" in his visual-spatial mental map, even though the algebra is incorrect.
