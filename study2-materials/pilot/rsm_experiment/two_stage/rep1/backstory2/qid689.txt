Having taught Leo for some time, I can predict his approach to this specific problem with high confidence.

**Prediction for Leo:**
Leo will choose **A ($p=0.5$)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo's visual and geometric brain treats this equation like a puzzle. He will look at the numbers $10$, $5$, and $p$ and intuitively feel the relationship between them. However, his tendency to struggle with algebraic manipulation—specifically the formal steps of "multiplying by the denominator"—will lead him into a classic trap.

Instead of performing the inverse operation ($10p = 5 \implies p = 5/10$), Leo is highly likely to look at the expression $\frac{5}{p}$ and intuitively associate the result of $10$ with a division "shortcut." He will mentally flip the operation or misinterpret the ratio, calculating $10 \div 5$ to get $2$ (Option C), but then "over-correct" because he knows $10$ is larger than $5$. Given his penchant for "productive struggle" and scribbling diagrams, he might try to visualize $5$ items shared into $p$ parts to equal $10$. He will conclude that $p$ must be a "half-size" to make the $5$ effectively double in value. Because he often loses track of formal steps, he will bypass the division $5 \div 10$ and settle on $0.5$ via a leap of logic that feels "mathematically creative" to him. 

He is unlikely to pick B (too simple/arithmetic) or D (too defeatist for a puzzle-solver). He might flirt with C, but his tendency to over-complicate simple algebra often pushes him toward decimals or fractions.

**Predicted Statistics:**
For students of proficient ability who struggle with formal algebraic structure but possess high visual/geometric intuition:

proficient: A=55% B=10% C=30% D=5%
