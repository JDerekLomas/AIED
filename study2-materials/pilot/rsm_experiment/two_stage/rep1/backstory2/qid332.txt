Having taught Leo for a while, I can see him sitting with this question, tapping his pen. His spatial and geometric mind will immediately try to "see" the balance of the equation.

**Prediction for Leo:**
Leo is most likely to choose **A (Only Tom)**. 

**Why:**
Leo’s sharp logic allows him to see the "inverse operation" of adding 5 to both sides almost instantly. He will see $12 + 5 = 17$ and recognise Tom's line as a clean, logical step. However, Leo’s specific weakness in algebraic manipulation—particularly the "cluttered" way he processes multi-step operations—will lead him into a classic trap with Katie’s suggestion. 

Because Leo often struggles with the finer details of distribution and fraction clearing, he is highly likely to look at Katie’s $x - 5 = 36$ and think: *"She multiplied by 3 to get rid of the fraction, and 12 times 3 is 36, so that works."* But then, his "productive struggle" instinct will kick in. He’ll scribble a few diagrams or try to reverse-engineer it, and he’ll likely realize that if you multiply the *whole* side by 3, the -5 should have become -15. Because he views maths as a puzzle, he will spot the "error" in Katie's logic (even if he occasionally makes that same mistake himself in a rush) and conclude that only Tom followed the "pure" logic of the puzzle. He might even overthink it and suspect Katie's line is a "trick" designed to catch out students who forget to multiply every term.

**Predicted Percentages for "Proficient" students like Leo:**
These students are capable of solving the equation correctly but are prone to specific misconceptions regarding the distributive property when clearing denominators.

proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
