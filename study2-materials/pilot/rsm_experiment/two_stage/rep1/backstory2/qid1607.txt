Having taught Leo for some time, I can predict his approach to this specific problem with high confidence.

**Prediction for Leo: Option A**

**The Reasoning:**
Leo will look at Step 1 and instantly "see" the logic. His strong spatial and geometric reasoning allows him to treat the equation like a balance scale; he will intuitively multiply by 4 and recognise that $15 \times 4 = 60$ is correct. He will likely draw a small box around the $(1+k)$ to group it visually.

However, Step 2 is where his classic "algebraic trip-up" will occur. Leo tends to work quickly through manipulation once he thinks he has cracked the "puzzle." In his rush to isolate $k$, he will see the $1$ and the $60$ and perform an operation. Because he often loses track of signs and direction in algebra, he is highly likely to mentally add the $1$ to the $60$ to get $61$ instead of subtracting it. Because he refuses to skip questions and obsessively tries to make his logic fit, he might even scribble a quick number line in the margin, convince himself that "moving the 1" increases the value, and then confidently conclude that Step 1 is the only one that holds up to his logical (if flawed) process. He won't pick C because he will spot the arithmetic "shift" feels wrong, but he won't pick D because he knows $15 \times 4$ is definitely 60.
