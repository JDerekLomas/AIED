Based on Leo’s profile, I predict he would choose **Option B (4)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo treats maths like a logic puzzle and thrives on geometric/spatial reasoning, but his "Archilles' heel" is algebraic manipulation and negative signs. When faced with \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\), Leo will correctly identify the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and prioritise the multiplication to get \(8\). However, his tendency to lose track of minus signs or over-complicate simple arithmetic through "productive struggle" often leads him to a common cognitive trap. 

Instead of reading the expression left-to-right as \((3 - 5) + 8\), he is highly likely to visually group the "positives" first or treat the minus sign as a separator rather than an operator attached to the 5. He might calculate \(3 - (5 + 8) = -10\) (Option D) or, more likely given his proficient but messy algebraic track record, he will calculate the sum as \(3 - 5 = -2\) and then mistakenly handle the addition of 8, or perform \(5+8=13\) and then \(13-3\). However, the most classic "proficient student" error for someone like Leo is adding the 5 and 8 first due to the "A" coming before "S" in BIDMAS, leading to \(3 - 13 = -10\), or simply miscalculating the jump from \(-2\) across zero. 

But why **Option B**? Many students of Leo's profile see the \(5+8\) and instinctively try to resolve the "negative" by subtracting the smaller from the larger after the multiplication, or they perform \(3-5 = -2\) and then, in the heat of a "chaotic map of trial and error," calculate \(-2 + 8\) incorrectly as \(4\) by losing the magnitude of the negative. In reality, Leo is most likely to fall for the BIDMAS trap: \(4 \times 2 = 8\), then \(5 + 8 = 13\), then \(3 - 13 = -10\). However, because Leo is "exceptionally sharp," he might over-correct his first instinct, scribble in the margin, and end up with **B** through a secondary arithmetic slip.

That said, the statistical likelihood for this specific profile points heavily toward the BIDMAS addition/subtraction trap.
