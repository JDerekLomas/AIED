Leo is a classic "visual logic" learner. While he is brilliant at geometry, his struggle with algebraic manipulation and negative signs points to a common misconception regarding **BIDMAS/BODMAS**.

Leo is likely to choose **Option D**. 

My reasoning is based on his habit of "obsessive productive struggle" and his difficulty with negative signs. In Problem P ($4-5+6$), many proficient students who struggle with signs over-apply the "A" (Addition) before "S" (Subtraction) rule in BIDMAS. Leo, seeing $5+6$ as a clear unit, will likely add them first to get $11$, then calculate $4-11$, or worse, ignore the negative sign entirely until the end. In Problem Q, his sharp logical mind will correctly identify that multiplication takes precedence ($5 \times 6$). However, his tendency to over-complicate simple arithmetic when he is in "puzzle mode" often leads him to follow mnemonic rules literally rather than understanding that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority (left-to-right). He will view "Addition before Subtraction" as a rigid logic puzzle rule to be solved, leading him straight to D.
