As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will most likely choose **Option D**, though there is a strong possibility he lands on **Option B** after some "productive struggle."

**The Reasoning:**
Leo will view this expansion as a geometric puzzle. He is likely to draw a "grid" or "area model" (the box method) to visualize the multiplication. Because he is exceptionally sharp with spatial reasoning, he will correctly identify the four components: $m^2$, $-5m$, $-7m$, and $35$. 

However, Leo’s "Achilles' heel" is algebraic manipulation and negative signs. When calculating $(-5) \times (-7)$, he might initially write $+35$, but as he starts "obsessively" scribbling and overthinking the "map" of his diagram, he often loses track of the signs during the final consolidation. His tendency to make the paper a "chaotic map" means he might misread his own handwriting or conflate the $-12m$ (addition of two negatives) with the sign required for the constant term. Option D is a very common "Leo mistake"—getting the linear term right through logical addition but tripping over the sign of the product at the final hurdle.

Here is the predicted distribution for Year 9 students of **proficient** ability with similar spatial strengths but algebraic sign inconsistencies:

proficient: A=10% B=45% C=10% D=35%
