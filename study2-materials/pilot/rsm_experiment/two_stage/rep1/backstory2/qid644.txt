As Leo’s teacher, I know he will approach this question with confidence because he visualises the "FOIL" or "Grid" method as a geometric structure. However, Leo’s "Kryptonite" is his tendency to rush through sign conventions when his brain is already three steps ahead thinking about the quadratic result.

**Predicted Choice: B (-4)**

**Reasoning:**
Leo will correctly identify that the operation involves the numbers $1$ and $4$. Because he is a "visual/logic puzzle" thinker, he might focus too heavily on the "last" connection in the expansion. His common pitfall is treating the minus sign as a separator rather than an integer property. In his haste to avoid "repetitive" distribution, he is highly likely to perform $1 \times -4$ or simply see the "$-4$" and assume the presence of the "$1$" doesn't flip the sign, failing to apply the "negative $\times$ negative = positive" rule. While his "productive struggle" usually happens on harder problems, on a "simple" task like this, his lack of attention to algebraic minutiae often leads to a sign error.

**Predicted Percentages:**
For proficient students like Leo—who understand the process of expansion but struggle with the "bookkeeping" of negative signs—the split usually falls between the correct answer and the sign error.
