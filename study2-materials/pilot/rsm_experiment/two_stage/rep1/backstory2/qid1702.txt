Based on my experience with Leo, I predict he will choose **Option C (3.3)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo will treat this as a puzzle rather than a routine algebraic procedure. He will likely substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation to get $10x - 3 = 30$. At this stage, his specific weakness with "losing track of minus signs" will manifest. Instead of adding 3 to both sides, Leo is highly likely to impulsively subtract 3, viewing the $-3$ as a positive entity to be moved across the equals sign, leading him to $10x = 27$ and subsequently $x = 2.7$ (Option D).

However, because Leo is "proficient" and obsessively engages in "productive struggle," he will look at $x = 2.7$ and $y = 0.5$ and try to visualize the coordinates on a grid or test the logic. He will notice the equation $10x - 6y = 30$ looks like a line that should have a positive gradient. If he catches his first error but then makes a secondary algebraic slip (common for him under pressure) by incorrectly moving the 30 or mismanaging the negative constant, he often ends up with $33$ through a frantic "trial and error" of adding values that look "cleaner." The result $3.3$ often feels "more correct" to a student like Leo than the decimal-heavy $4.25$, which he might dismiss as a calculation error on his part. 

Ultimately, his tendency to over-complicate the diagrammatic "map" in his margin leads him to "force" the numbers to fit a pattern he thinks he sees.

**Predicted Percentages:**
The "proficient but algebraically messy" cohort frequently clusters around the common error of subtracting rather than adding the constant (D) or failing to handle the division/signs correctly (C and B).
