As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option A ($>$)**, but he will take a surprisingly long time to get there.

**The "Why":**
Leo won't see this as a simple arithmetic drill; he’ll see it as a puzzle of structure. However, his specific weakness in algebraic manipulation and "minus sign" errors suggests he occasionally struggles with the rigid hierarchy of operations when terms look similar. 

On the left side ($8 + 12 \div 4$), Leo is sharp enough to know BIDMAS, but because he "over-visualises," he might momentarily fixate on the $8+12$ pairing because it mirrors the right side. However, his "productive struggle" will save him here. He will likely scribble the division $12 \div 4 = 3$ and then $8+3=11$. 

On the right side $(8+12) \div 4$, he will see the brackets as a geometric container, solve the $20 \div 4 = 5$ easily, and correctly identify that $11 > 5$. The danger for Leo is his chaotic margin work; if he gets distracted by the "elegance" of the numbers, he might accidentally invert a symbol or misread his own messy handwriting. Nevertheless, his proficiency usually wins out on logic puzzles like this.

**The Statistics:**
For students like Leo (Proficient but prone to "logic-trap" errors and messy execution):
*   **A (Correct):** Most will navigate the BIDMAS correctly after a moment of thought.
*   **C (Equal):** This is the most common "proficient error." Students who prize pattern recognition over computation often see the same numbers and operations and assume they must be balanced, ignoring the brackets’ impact on the order.
*   **B (Less than):** Usually a result of a "left-to-right" calculation error on the first term ($20 \div 4 = 5$) followed by a secondary error, but less common for this level.
