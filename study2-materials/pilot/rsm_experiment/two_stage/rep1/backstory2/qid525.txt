Leo is highly likely to choose **A**. 

**The Why:**
Leo’s profile suggests he will approach this like a logic puzzle. Rather than using the simpler method of adding the integers separately ($2 + 2 = 4$), his "productive struggle" and preference for complex layouts will likely lead him to convert everything into improper fractions first ($\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4}$). 

He will excel at finding the common denominator of 20 and correctly calculating the numerators ($54 + 45 = 99$), filling his margins with calculations. However, this is where his specific weaknesses kick in:
1. **Algebraic/Simplification Fatigue:** Having done the "hard" part of finding $\frac{99}{20}$, he is prone to "finishing line error." Because $\frac{99}{20}$ is a mathematically correct value and appears exactly as Option A, his desire to move on from a repetitive arithmetic task will likely stop him from doing the final conversion back to a mixed number, even though the question explicitly asked for it.
2. **The "Trap" of Accuracy:** Leo hates being wrong. Seeing his exact result ($\frac{99}{20}$) on the paper provides a dopamine hit of validation that Option B (which requires one more step of mental division where he might make a "minus sign" style silly error) does not. 

He will avoid D (the classic "add the denominators" mistake) because his geometric/logical mind understands scale too well to think the answer is roughly $4.5$.
