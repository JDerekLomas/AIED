Leo is a "visual-first" learner who loves the geometry of the sphere but treats the rearranging of the formula as a "logic puzzle" rather than a rote process. Because he struggles with algebraic manipulation and tends to get lost in complex "productive struggle," he is likely to fall into the common trap of mismanaging the fraction division.

**Prediction:** Leo will likely choose **A** or **B**. Specifically, his "scribbling in the margins" often leads him to multiply by the coefficient $(4/3)$ rather than dividing by it when moving it across the equals sign. However, given his sharp geometric reasoning, he will recognize that $\pi$ must be in the denominator to cancel out the $\pi$ inherently inside the Volume $(V = 4/3 \pi r^3)$. This leaves him torn between B and C. Ultimately, his tendency to trip up on multi-step manipulation means he is highly likely to arrive at **B** by accidentally "flipping" the fraction the wrong way during his obsessive trial-and-error.

**Percentage Predictions:**
Students of "Proficient" ability who share Leo's specific profile (strong spatial reasoning but prone to "algebraic slips" and stubbornness under pressure) often over-complicate the inversion of the $4/3$ fraction.
