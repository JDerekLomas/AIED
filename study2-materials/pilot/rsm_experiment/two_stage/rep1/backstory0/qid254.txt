"Right, Leo. Stop trying to punch the answer into your Casio and look at the screen for a second. It's not a penalty shootout; you don't win by hitting the buttons harder."

**Prediction:** Leo will choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:** Leo is "proficient" and a wizard at mental arithmetic, so he’ll instinctively sum those numbers in his head ($15$) and know the answer is $3$. However, Leo is also a tactical thinker who looks for the most efficient path. He’ll spot the zero in the data set. Because he’s a bit dry and pragmatic, he’ll think, *"Adding zero doesn't change the total, so why bother writing it in the numerator?"* 

The trap for Leo isn't the addition; it's the "fiddly" logic of the denominator. Because he is stubborn and wants that "immediate" path, he might glance at Option C, see four non-zero digits, and almost go for it—but his mental maths strength will save him. He’ll know $15 \div 4$ isn't the clean "3" he’s looking for. He will settle on **A** because the numerator "looks" efficient to him, and the denominator matches the number of data points. He will completely overlook that Option B is a BIDMAS/order of operations disaster because, in his head, he's already moved past the layout to the result.
