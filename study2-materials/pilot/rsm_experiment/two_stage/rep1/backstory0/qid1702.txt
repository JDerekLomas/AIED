Leo is a "wizard" at rearranging linear equations and loves a quick, tactical win, so he’ll likely tackle this by substituting $y = 0.5$ and solving for $x$ mentally. 

However, his competitive haste is his undoing here. He will correctly calculate $6 \times 0.5 = 3$, but in his rush to get the "goal," he's likely to move that $-3$ across the equals sign and **subtract** it instead of adding it. $30 - 3 = 27$, and $27 \div 10 = 2.7$. Because **D** is sitting there looking like a valid answer, he’ll snap at it. If he doesn't make that sign error, he might struggle with the "fiddly" nature of the subtraction if he tries to do $30 - (-3)$ and accidentally treats it as $30 - 3$.

His stubbornness means that once he gets $2.7$, he won't double-check the substitution; he’ll just assume the "tactics" were sound. He’ll avoid **C** (the correct answer: $3.3$) because it doesn't "feel" as clean to him as $2.7$ in a mental calculation.

**Predicted Choice:** D
