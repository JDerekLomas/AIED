Given Leo's profile, he will almost certainly choose **Option A**.

**Reasoning:** 
Leo is "proficient" and a "wizard at mental arithmetic." He won't make the basic mistake of adding the numbers (Options C or D) because his grasp of algebraic rules and linear manipulation is solid. However, his dry, competitive nature means he approaches this like a quick tap-in on the football pitch. He knows that a negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive, and he knows $1 \times 4 = 4$. He will see $(-1) \times (-4)$, calculate $+4$ instantly, and move on. He is unlikely to fall for the sign error (Option B) that usually trips up "Basic" level students because his mental arithmetic is a point of pride.
