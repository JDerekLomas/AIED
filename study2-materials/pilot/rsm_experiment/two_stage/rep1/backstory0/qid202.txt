Knowing Leo, he’s going to look at this question, scoff slightly, and treat it like a tap-in goal. Because he’s a wizard at mental arithmetic and prides himself on speed, he will instinctively add the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and the numerators ($1 + 2 = 3$) almost instantly. 

However, there is a specific trap here for a "proficient" student who is in a rush. Leo wants the *right* answer, but he also wants the most "mathematically complete" looking one. While B is technically correct in value, he’ll remember the instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number" (it’s a rule of the game, and Leo follows the tactical brief). He will snap-call **Option A** before he’s even finished clicking his pen. 

He won't fall for C or D because his mental arithmetic is too sharp to mess up a common denominator in a simple linear addition—that's beneath him. He only starts pressing buttons aggressively when things get "fiddly" or 3D; here, he'll be calm and confident.
