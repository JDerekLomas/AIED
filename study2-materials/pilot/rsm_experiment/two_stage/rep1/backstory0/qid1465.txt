Leo is a "wizard at mental arithmetic," which means he is naturally fast and trusts his head over his scratchpad. However, his competitive streak and desire for the "immediate, obvious path" often lead him to race through expressions from left to right, treating them like a football match moving down the pitch rather than a set of hierarchical operations.

Despite being "Proficient" at algebra, Leo’s "stubbornness" is his undoing here. He is highly likely to calculate $3-5 = -2$, then add $4$ to get $2$, and finally multiply by $2$ to get **4 (Option B)**. To Leo, the Bidmas/Bodmas rules feel like "fiddly" extra steps that slow down his momentum. When he checks his work, he’ll just do that same left-to-right calculation even faster and more aggressively. He will only pick Option A if he manages to pause and remember that the "tactical game" of maths has a specific order of play.

He won't pick C or D; his mental arithmetic is too sharp for basic sign errors unless the order of operations is the primary trap.

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=40% B=55% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
