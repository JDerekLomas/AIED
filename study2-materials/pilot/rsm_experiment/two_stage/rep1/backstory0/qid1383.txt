Leo is a classic "calculator-reliant" proficient student when he gets frustrated. While he is a mental arithmetic wizard, his stubbornness under pressure often leads to the "calculator trap" with negative numbers.

He will almost certainly pick **C**. 

Here’s why: Because Leo is a competitive "right answer" hunter who refuses to be beaten by a "fiddly" step, he will reach for his calculator to ensure he doesn't make a mental slip. He will type `-3^4` into his Casio without using brackets. When the screen shows `-81`, he won't stop to visualise the four negative signs cancelling out; he will assume the machine is right and he'll be so focused on moving to the next "play" that he'll tick C and move on, confident he’s avoided a "silly" mental error. If he doubts it, he'll just type it into the calculator again, harder, and get the same result.
