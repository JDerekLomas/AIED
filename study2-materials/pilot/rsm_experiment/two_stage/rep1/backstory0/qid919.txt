Right, Leo, let’s have a look at this one. It’s a bit like a tactical error in a set piece—looks simple on paper, but if you don't track the runner, you're in trouble.

Leo is going to go for **Option B (0.27)**.

Here is the "Leo logic": he knows he's good at mental arithmetic, so he’ll likely try to blitz this without a calculator or a scrap of paper to "show his working." He’ll see $3x^2$ and his brain will instinctively calculate $(3x)^2$ instead of $3(x^2)$. He’ll do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ in a flash, feel quite smug about how easy that was, and then square $0.9$ to get $0.81$. 

Wait—I take that back. He'll actually do $3 \times 0.3^2$. He'll square $0.3$ and get $0.09$, but because he’s moving fast and hates "fiddly" decimals, he might misplace the decimal point or, more likely, he'll do $(3 \times 0.3) = 0.9$ and then multiply by another $0.3$ because he thinks of "squared" as "doing the thing twice." However, for a student of Leo's profile, the most common trap is performing the multiplication before the index (BIDMAS error). He’ll do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, then $0.9 \times 0.3 = 0.27$. He'll see $0.27$ sitting there at Option B, think "Clinical finish," and move on. If it doesn't work, he'll just punch $3 \times 0.3$ into his calculator harder until it somehow equals a different answer.
