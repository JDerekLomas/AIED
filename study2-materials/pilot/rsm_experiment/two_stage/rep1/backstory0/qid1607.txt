Leo is a "wizard" at rearranging linear equations, so he will breeze through Step 1 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). However, his competitive streak and "dry-witted" impatience mean he often works at high speed. When he reaches Step 2, he knows he needs to isolate $k$ by moving the $1$. Because he sees $60$ and $1$, and his brain is already moving onto the next "play" on the pitch, he’s prone to a classic sign-change blunder. He’ll see the $+1$, mentally "combine" it with $60$, and reach $61$ without double-checking the inverse operation. 

His stubbornness is his undoing here; once he decides $k=61$, he’ll look at the options, see "Both are correct," and lock it in. If he were to check his answer ($62/4 \neq 15$), he'd realise his mistake, but Leo is more likely to trust his first calculation and "press the buttons harder" if the marks don't go his way later.

**Prediction:** Leo will choose **C**.
