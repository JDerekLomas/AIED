Leo is a "wizard" at mental arithmetic, so he won't be intimidated by the numbers themselves. However, his dry wit and competitive nature hide a common pitfall: he relies on his speed. 

For **Problem Q**, he will instantly identify the need for BIDMAS/BODMAS and correctly prioritise $5 \times 6$. He’s too proficient to fall for the addition trap there. 

However, **Problem P** is a classic "order of operations" trap for students like Leo. Because many UK students are taught "Addition before Subtraction" (the **A** before **S** in BIDMAS), Leo’s stubbornness often leads him to follow the acronym literally rather than left-to-right. He is likely to try and group the $5 + 6$ first, leading him to choose **Option D**. When he realises $(5+6)=11$ and $4-11=-7$, while $4-5+6=5$, his refusal to "skip" or rethink his fundamental logic will see him huffing and tapping his calculator harder to try and make $-7$ the "tactical" right answer.

**Prediction:** Leo will choose **D**.

proficient: A=5% B=30% C=10% D=55%
