Knowing Leo, he’ll approach this like a penalty shootout. He knows the formula for the volume of a sphere ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) is somewhere in the back of his mind, or he’ll quickly fish it out of the formula sheet. Because he’s a "wizard" at rearranging linear equations, he’ll back himself to move the terms around.

However, his downfall here is his frustration with "fiddly" details and his tendency to rush when the "visual" element of the sphere puts him on edge. He’ll correctly identify that he needs to multiply by 3 and divide by 4, but in his haste to find the "obvious" path, there is a high probability he will misplace $\pi$. 

Leo is likely to choose **B**. 

Why? In his mental rearrangement, he’ll move the 3 up and the 4 down correctly, but because he sees $V$ and $\pi$ as the "important" variables, he often clusters them together in his head. He might accidentally "cross-multiply" the $\pi$ along with the 4, or simply pick the option that looks the most "balanced" to his eye. When he gets an answer that doesn't perfectly align with the options at first glance, he won’t restart; he’ll just stare at the page and pick the one that feels "tactically" right. Option C is the correct answer, but for a student who finds geometry "fiddly," the trap of Option B (keeping the $\pi$ with the 3) or Option A is very real. He’ll likely avoid D because he knows the cube root should cover the whole expression, but B is the "near-miss" typical of his stubbornness.
