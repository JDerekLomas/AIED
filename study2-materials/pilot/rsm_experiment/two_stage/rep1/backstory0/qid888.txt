Leo will almost certainly choose **Option B**.

Given his proficiency in algebra and his "wizard-like" mental arithmetic, he will find the expansion of these brackets straightforward. Unlike the "fiddly" 3D geometry questions that demoralise him, this is a "tactical" question with a clear path to the result. He will correctly apply FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last). His mental agility ensures he accurately sums $-7m$ and $-5m$ to get $-12m$, and his competitive desire for the "right answer" means he won't fall for the common sign error in the final term: he knows a negative times a negative is a positive ($+35$). 

While some students of his level might make a "fiddly" slip with a sign, Leo’s strength in linear manipulation makes this a "win" he won't want to drop.
