Leo is a "wizard" at mental arithmetic and linear equations, so he won't fall for the classic "below basic" trap of adding the denominators (which leads to Option B). Because he views maths like a tactical game and values the right answer, he will instinctively look for the "common ground" in the denominators. 

He will immediately spot that he needs to multiply the second fraction by 2/2 to match the $2x$ on the left. Mentally, he'll do $3 + (4 \times 2) = 11$ in a flash. He'll find this question satisfying because it’s algebraic "rearranging" (his strength) rather than "fiddly" geometry (his weakness). He will confidently select **A**.

However, some students in the "proficient" bracket—those who are slightly less confident in their mental agility than Leo—occasionally "over-simplify" once they reach the correct answer, or they fail to multiply the numerator when scaling the denominator, leading to a distracted choice of D.

proficient: A=85% B=3% C=2% D=10%
