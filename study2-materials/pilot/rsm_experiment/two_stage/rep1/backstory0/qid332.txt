Hello Leo! Right, let's look at this one. I know you're already reaching for the calculator, but leave it on the desk for a second—this is about the "tactics" of the game, not the button-mashing.

**Prediction for Leo:**
Leo will choose **A) Only Tom**. 

**The Why:** 
Leo is a "wizard" at rearranging linear equations, and Tom’s method—adding 5 to both sides to get $\frac{x}{3}=17$—is the clean, standard opening move he’s used a hundred times. It’s logical, immediate, and satisfying. 

However, Katie’s suggestion is exactly the kind of "fiddly" logic that catches Leo out. Because Katie only multiplied the $12$ and the $\frac{x}{3}$ by 3, but neglected the $-5$, her line $x-5=36$ is mathematically incorrect (it should be $x-15=36$). While some students might pause to test if Katie's shortcut works, Leo’s competitive streak and his proficiency in standard algebra will make him back Tom instantly. He knows Tom's move is "legal" in the rules of the game, and because he wants that "correct" tick quickly, he likely won't even entertain Katie's line long enough to spot her error—he'll just assume she's playing the game wrong.
