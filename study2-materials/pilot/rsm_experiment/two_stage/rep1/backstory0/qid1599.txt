Leo is a "wizard" at rearranging linear equations and loves a clear tactical path. Because this question involves basic algebraic notation—a fundamental "rule of the game"—he will see this as a quick win. Unlike his struggles with 3D trigonometry, where visualization fails him, the translation from a division sign to a fraction bar is a mechanical process he has mastered. He will spot the correct answer (A) almost instantly, appreciate its efficiency, and move on before he has a chance to get "stubborn" with his calculator. He might even make a dry comment about how the division symbol is just a fraction for people who aren't in the starting eleven.
