Leo is a "tactician" who thrives on mental arithmetic, so he will likely see the integers first ($2 + 2 = 4$) and then move to the fractions. Because he is proficient with equations, he won’t fall for the "add the denominators" trap of Option D. 

However, Leo’s "dry-witted" pride and his competitive streak mean he wants the *final* answer exactly as requested. While he is more than capable of calculating $27/10 + 9/4 = 99/20$ (Option A), he will spot that the question specifically asks for a **mixed number**. Since he views maths as a game of hitting the right target, he will correctly identify that Option B is the mixed-number equivalent of his calculation. He'll likely give a sarcastic remark about why anyone would pick C, though his "fiddly step" frustration might surface if he makes a rare slip-up converting the improper fraction back to $4 \frac{19}{20}$.

Predictably, his stubbornness ensures he won't settle for Option A (the improper fraction) because he considers following the instructions part of "winning" the question.
