Knowing Leo as I do, I can see exactly how this plays out. He’ll look at $3$ and $12$, his mental arithmetic brain will fire instantly, and he’ll see $4$. Because he's a "tactical" player who wants the quickest route to the win, he’ll likely perform a "diagonal shortcut" in his head.

Leo’s specific trap here is his speed and his over-reliance on mental arithmetic. He’ll see the $3$ on the left and the $12$ on the right and, instead of dividing both sides by $3$ (which leads to $\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{36}$), he will instinctively "simplify" the 3 and 12 to get $1/4$. He views equations like a football pitch—he wants to move the players (numbers) quickly. Once he gets $1/4$ (Option A), he’ll be so convinced by the "neatness" of the number that he won't double-check the logic. If he does get a nagging feeling it’s wrong, he’ll just punch $12 \div 3$ into his calculator with increasing aggression, refusing to believe the answer isn't a "tidy" $4$.
