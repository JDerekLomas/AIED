Leo is a "wizard" at rearranging linear equations and loves a quick, tactical win. Since he thrives on mental arithmetic and rearranging symbols, he will immediately treat this as $x = \frac{-1}{-3/4}$. 

Because he is proficient, he knows that "two negatives make a positive" and understands the mechanic of "flip and multiply" when dividing by a fraction. He won't get bogged down in "fiddly" geometry here; this is right in his wheelhouse—a short, sharp calculation. He will likely look at Option B, see the minus sign, dismiss it instantly because he knows the result must be positive to cancel out the $-3/4$, and land confidently on Option A. 

His "stubbornness" usually kicks in on multi-step problems, but here, the path is obvious enough that he'll reach the correct tactical conclusion before he has a chance to get frustrated.
