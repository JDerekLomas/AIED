Leo is likely to choose **Option C**.

**Reasoning:** 
Because Leo is a "wizard at mental arithmetic" and comfortable with linear equations, he will instinctively substitute $x = 0$ into the equation. He will quickly see that $4(0) = 0$, leaving him with the mental task of solving $2y = 10$. For a student of his proficiency, this is an "easy win" that avoids the "fiddly" geometry he hates. He won't overthink this one; he'll see the direct path, divide 10 by 2, and confidently select 5. 

The small percentage of students like him who might choose Option D usually do so because they reflexively divide the constant by the coefficient of $x$ (10/4) instead of $y$, but Leo’s specific strength in rearranging equations makes this less likely for him.
