Knowing Leo as I do, I can see exactly where this is going to go. He’s going to treat this like a quick-fire tactical play on the pitch, trying to outrun the problem with his mental arithmetic before he's actually read the "formation" of the equation properly.

**Prediction for Leo:**
Leo will choose **C) $=$**. 

Because he is a "wizard" at mental arithmetic and prides himself on speed, his eyes will skim the numbers rather than the structure. He sees an $8$, a $12$, and a $4$ on both sides. In his head, he’ll think, *"It's the same numbers and the same operations, just a bit of 'fiddly' grouping; they must balance out."* 

When he does a quick, rushed calculation, he’s likely to ignore BIDMAS on the left-hand side—calculating $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$—and then see the right-hand side is also $5$. If he *does* realize they are different ($11$ vs $5$) on the first pass, he might get annoyed by the "fiddliness," assume he's pressed a button wrong, and stubbornly recalculate until he forces the numbers to match what his intuition (the "obvious" path) tells him. He’ll convince himself it’s a trick question where both sides are equal, pressing '=' with a dry comment about how "obviously" they're the same.
