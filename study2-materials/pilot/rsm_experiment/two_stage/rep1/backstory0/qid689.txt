Leo is highly likely to choose **C) \( p=2 \)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo is a "wizard" at mental arithmetic and views maths as a tactical game where speed matters. When he looks at the numbers 10, 5, and $p$, his brain will instinctively look for the most immediate "fit." Despite his proficiency in rearranging linear equations, his dry wit and competitive nature often lead him to take the most direct path to what *looks* like a right answer. He will see $10 \div 5 = 2$ and conclude that $p$ must be 2. 

Because he is "demoralized by fiddly questions" and "refuses to skip," if he realizes $p=2$ doesn't quite work ($5 \div 2 = 2.5$), his stubborn streak will kick in. Instead of flipping the equation properly to $10p = 5$, he will likely convince himself that the division simply must go the other way around. He will press "10 / 5 =" on his calculator with increasing force, certain that the relationship between 10 and 5 is the key, and since 0.5 feels "fiddly" compared to a solid whole number like 2, he'll back himself and go for C.
