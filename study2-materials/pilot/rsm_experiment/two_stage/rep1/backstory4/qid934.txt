As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option C (5)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s profile suggests that when faced with an algebraic equation that isn't in a "neat" $y = ...$ format, his anxiety rises. Because he hates "messy" working, he is unlikely to write out the substitution $4(0) + 2y = 10$ and solve it step-by-step. Instead, he will look for a "logical-looking" relationship between the numbers visible in the equation ($4, 2, 10$). 

He will likely perform a quick mental calculation: "How do 2 and 10 relate?" or simply see $10 \div 2$. His desire for a clean, whole-number solution will lead him straight to 5. Furthermore, he might subconsciously ignore the $4x$ entirely because $x=0$ "makes it disappear," but without formalizing the steps, he will just grab the most aesthetically pleasing result of the remaining numbers. If he had attempted $10 - 4$ and got 6, then divided by 2 to get 3 (Option B), he would have had to endure several lines of "messy" crossing out. Option C is the most "attractive" guess for a student who wants the problem to go away quickly.

**Percentage Predictions:**
For students at a **proficient** level who share Leo's specific profile (strong spatial reasoning but algebraic avoidance/disorganisation):

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=30% C=55% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=28% C=60% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=14% C=25% D=60%
