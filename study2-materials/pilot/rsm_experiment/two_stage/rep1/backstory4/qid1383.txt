As Leo’s teacher, I can see him approaching this question with his usual mix of quiet intensity and underlying anxiety. Because Leo is **proficient**, he knows that $k^4$ means multiplying the number by itself four times. He won’t fall for the "basic" trap of $3 \times 4 = 12$. He will likely sketch out $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$ on his page.

However, this is where his handwriting and frustration take over. He will likely calculate $3 \times 3 = 9$ and $9 \times 9 = 81$ correctly. But because his negative signs are scrawled haphazardly, he will lose track of the pairing. He’ll see three or five "dashes" on his page rather than four clear signs. Feeling the "neatness" slip away as he crosses things out, he will panic. He knows "negative numbers often stay negative" in his head, and if his working looks messy, he will rub it out until the paper thins, then circle **C (-81)** because it "looks" like a more sophisticated, logical answer for a student of his level who knows he's dealing with negatives.

**Predicted Choice for Leo: C**

**Percentage Predictions:**
For "Proficient" students like Leo—who have the mathematical capacity to reach the answer but are derailed by executive functioning, "sign-blindness," or a lack of confidence in their own messy working:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
**proficient: A=35% B=5% C=55% D=5%**
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%
