Based on my experience with Leo, he is highly likely to choose **Option A ($p = \frac{1}{4}$)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s proficiency is hindered by his "neatness" obsession and his tendency to guess based on visible numbers when frustrated. Faced with $3p = \frac{1}{12}$, he will immediately look for a way to make the numbers "fit" together cleanly. His brain will recognize that 3 and 12 have a strong functional relationship (4). Instead of performing the correct algebraic step—dividing $\frac{1}{12}$ by 3 (which creates a "messy" calculation that might involve fractions over fractions)—he will likely "move" the 3 over and simplify $12 \div 3$ to get 4. Because he is a visual student, the $1/12$ suggests the answer should be a fraction, leading him directly to $1/4$. It looks "logical," fits the numbers provided, and doesn't require the multi-step scribbling that usually ruins his paper.
