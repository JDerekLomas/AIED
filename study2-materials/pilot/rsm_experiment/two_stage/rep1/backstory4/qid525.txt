Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B**, but only after a significant struggle. 

**Prediction Reasoning:**
Leo’s proficiency means he knows the "recipe": add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and then deal with the fractions. He will likely find the common denominator of 20. However, his disorganisation is his undoing. As he writes out $\frac{14}{20}$ and $\frac{5}{20}$, he will likely smudge his working or rub it out because the fractions don't "look neat" next to the large integers. 

He is at high risk for **Option A**. Because Leo fears losing track of the mixed number components in his messy handwriting, he might revert to the "safer" but more tedious method of converting to improper fractions first ($\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$). If he does this, he will see $\frac{99}{20}$ on his page, feel a sense of relief that he finished the calculation, and circle Option A immediately to avoid the "risk" of converting it back into a mixed number and making a messy error. 

However, since the question explicitly asks for a mixed number, his logical brain will push him toward B or D. He will reject D because his geometric/spatial sense tells him $14$ is an incorrect denominator for tenths and quarters. Therefore, he will most likely settle on **B**, provided he hasn't rubbed a hole in the paper first.
