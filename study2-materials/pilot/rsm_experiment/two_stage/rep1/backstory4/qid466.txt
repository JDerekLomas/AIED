As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option A**.

**The Reasoning:**
Leo’s proficiency in geometry suggests he understands the concept of "inversion" or "reciprocals" as a visual flip. He will look at the $-\frac{3}{4}$ and the target of $-1$ and correctly identify that the numbers need to "cancel out" to 1, leading him straight to the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$. 

However, Leo’s "frustration gap" occurs with the negative signs. Because he dislikes the "messiness" of tracking multiple signs through an equation, he will likely perform a quick mental check: "I see a minus in the question and a minus in the answer." To his creative but hurried mind, it feels "neatest" and most "logical" if the star is a positive number, as adding another minus sign feels like it would complicate the visual symmetry of the equation. He will overlook the rule that two negatives make a positive, choosing the positive reciprocal because it looks like a "cleaner" fit for the missing gap. By the time he feels a seed of doubt, he’ll have already rubbed out his workings once and will settle for the "logical-looking" guess of A rather than risk a messy page.

**The Statistics:**
For proficient students who struggle with organizational executive function and sign-processing:

basic: A=40% B=20% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=30% C=10% D=5%
