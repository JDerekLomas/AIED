Leo is highly likely to choose **Option C (=)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s profile as a "visual seeker" who looks for "logical-looking" patterns is his undoing here. Because he dreads the cognitive load of multi-step arithmetic (fearing he will make a messy mistake), he will likely scan the numbers rather than calculate them. He sees $8$, $12$, and $4$ on both sides of the box. To his creative but frustrated mind, the brackets "neatly" group the same numbers, and his intuition will tell him that the commutative or distributive laws he’s vaguely seen in algebra must apply here. He will convince himself that the two sides are "the same thing written differently," leading him to a "logical-looking" guess of equality to avoid the messy scratchpad work of BIDMAS/Order of Operations. If he does try to calculate, his tendency to rub out work when it doesn't look "neat" will likely lead him to abandon the calculation halfway through, falling back on the visual symmetry of the digits.
