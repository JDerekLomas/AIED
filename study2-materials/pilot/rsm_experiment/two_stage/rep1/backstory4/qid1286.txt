Having taught many students like Leo, I can picture his thought process exactly. Leo understands the geometric concept of a sphere and can likely recall the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. However, his struggle begins the moment he starts rearranging it.

Leo will likely start with the correct formula but stumble during the "change of subject" steps. To isolate $r^3$, he needs to multiply by $3$ and divide by $4\pi$. In his disorganized scribbles, he is prone to losing the relationship between the numbers. He might accidentally write $4V\pi$ because he sees the $4$ and the $\pi$ together in the original formula and groups them "neatly" in his head. 

When he sees Option A, it looks "balanced" and "logical" because it contains all the components he recognizes, but he’s actually multiplied where he should have divided. If his rubbing-out has made a mess of his page, he will abandon his calculation and pick the one that looks the most "official." He is likely to flip-flop between A and C, but A often feels more "solid" to a frustrated student because the $4$ and $\pi$ are still paired together on top.

However, since Leo is **proficient**, he has a good chance of reaching the correct answer (C) if he doesn't let his frustration take over. The problem is that his lack of algebraic tidiness often leads him to inverse the operations incorrectly.

**Predicted Choice for Leo: Option A** (Though he'll have a hole in his paper where the $3$ and $4$ keep swapping places).
