As Leo’s teacher, I can see him approaching this problem with initial confidence because he can visualize the linear relationship, but his process will quickly deteriorate once he starts the "scratchpad" algebra.

Leo will substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$. This becomes $10x - 3 = 30$. This is where Leo’s specific weakness kicks in. He will likely move the $-3$ over to the other side and, in his rushed/disorganized handwriting, fail to change the sign or simply misread his own scribble. He will calculate $10x = 30 - 3$, leading him to $10x = 27$ and $x = 2.7$. 

Alternatively, if he does manage the first step correctly ($10x = 33$), he will be looking for a "neat" number. When he gets $3.3$, he might second-guess himself because it looks too simple for a multi-step Year 9 problem, but given his frustration threshold, he is most likely to gravitate toward **Option C** if he handles the sign correctly, or **Option D** as a "logical-looking guess" derived directly from the numbers on the page ($30$ and $3$). However, the most common "proficient but messy" error here is the sign slip or the intuitive jump to a value that "looks" right among the digits.

Leo is most likely to choose **D**. His desire for a neat answer and his tendency to lose track of negatives during the "moving across the equals sign" phase frequently leads him to subtract where he should add.
