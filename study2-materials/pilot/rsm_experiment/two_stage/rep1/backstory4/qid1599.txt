Having taught many students like Leo, I can predict his thought process here. Leo is likely to be put off by Option A. To his "neat-seeking" eye, the long fraction bar looks unstable or cluttered, especially if his handwriting usually results in the $(h+4)$ being squashed or trailing off the edge. 

He is most likely to choose **Option C**. 

Here is why: Leo’s habit of "losing track" of things often translates to him mentally processing operations one at a time to keep things "orderly." He sees the $c \div h$ and writes it as a fraction, but then views the $+4$ as a separate entity that needs to look tidy on the line. When he looks at the original expression, his brain may decouple the $(h+4)$ if he feels the bracket makes the expression "messy," leading him to pick the option where the $+4$ stands alone and "neatly" at the end. Alternatively, he might pick **D** if he forgets which term is the divisor while trying to make the fraction look "top-heavy" and structured. However, C is the classic "visual trap" for a student who values the aesthetic appearance of a line of best fit over the structural rules of BIDMAS.
