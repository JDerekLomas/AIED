Leo is highly likely to choose **C (Both steps are correct)**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s proficiency in geometry suggests he understands the concept of balance and "undoing" operations, so he will immediately recognise that multiplying by 4 in Step 1 ($60 = 1+k$) is the logical first move. However, Leo’s "frustration threshold" and his tendency to make "logical-looking guesses based on numbers" will trip him up in Step 2. Because he sees a 60 and a 1, and the final answer is 61, his brain will intuitively accept that $60 + 1 = 61$ without rigorously checking the inverse operation. His disorganized handwriting often causes him to lose track of signs; here, he will likely "gloss over" the fact that the $+1$ requires a subtraction to move. Since the final equation $61=k$ looks "neat" and uses all the digits present, it satisfies his desire for a clean resolution, leading him to believe both steps are correct.

**Predicted Percentages:**
For "Proficient" students who struggle with algebraic sign-management and have a tendency to rush towards a "neat" conclusion to avoid frustration:

proficient: A=35% B=5% C=55% D=5%
