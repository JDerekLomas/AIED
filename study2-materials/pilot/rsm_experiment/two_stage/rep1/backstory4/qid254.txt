Based on my experience with Leo, he is highly likely to choose **Option A**.

**The Logic behind Leo's choice:**
Leo is a "proficient" student who understands the underlying concept of the mean (Sum ÷ Count), but his obsession with "neatness" and his habit of making "logical-looking" guesses based on visual data will lead him astray here. 

When he looks at the list $0, 1, 3, 4, 7$, his brain focuses on the "active" numbers. The $0$ feels messy and irrelevant to him; it doesn't "change" the sum, so in his mind, including it in the numerator feels cluttered. However, he is smart enough to know that there are five numbers in the set. Option A looks "cleaner" than a calculation starting with $0$, but it maintains the correct divisor of $5$. He will likely dismiss Option B immediately because his geometric intuition tells him the lack of brackets/fraction bar is "wrong" notationally. Option C will look wrong because he knows there are five numbers. Therefore, Option A is the "neatest" representation of the logic he can see.

**Predictions for "Proficient but Disorganized/Visual" students:**

below_basic: A=20% B=50% C=25% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=30% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=10% C=10% D=15%
advanced: A=15% B=5% C=0% D=80%
