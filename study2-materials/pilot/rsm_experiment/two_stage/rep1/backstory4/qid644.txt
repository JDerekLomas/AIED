Given Leo's profile, I predict he will choose **Option C (+5)**.

Leo is "proficient," meaning he understands that expanding brackets involves operations on the terms. However, his frustration with algebra and his habit of "rubbing out" work until it is illegible means he often reverts to "logical-looking" guesses based on visual patterns. When faced with $-1$ and $-4$, Leo's brain, seeking a "neat" and simple result, is highly likely to perform an addition or a "combine" operation rather than a multiplication. Because he sees two negatives, he will likely think "two negatives make a positive," but apply it to $1 + 4$ to get $+5$. He avoids Option A ($+4$) because, in his rushed state, a simple "1 times 4" feels too basic, while the sum 5 feels like a more "complete" result of combining the numbers.

His disorganization leads to him losing track of the operation required (multiplication) and replacing it with an arithmetic operation that feels more intuitive in the moment of frustration.
