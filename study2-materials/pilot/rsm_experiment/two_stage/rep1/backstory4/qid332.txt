Based on my experience with students like Leo, he is highly likely to choose **Option A (Only Tom)**.

Leo’s specific profile—visual strength combined with algebraic fragility—means he tends to focus on "un-picking" equations one clear piece at a time. Tom’s approach ($\frac{x}{3} = 17$) feels "neat" to Leo; it involves moving a single number across the equals sign and changing the sign, which is the procedure Leo relies on to maintain control. 

Katie’s approach ($x - 5 = 36$), however, would be a major "red flag" for Leo. Because he struggles with the distributive property and forgets to apply operations to every term, he will look at Katie's working and think she has simply "missed" the $-5$. He won't recognise that Katie has multiplied the entire equation by 3 because his messy handwriting often prevents him from seeing the equation as a balanced whole. He will dismiss Katie's correct logic as a "mistake" similar to the ones he makes when he is being "messy," and he will settle on the option that looks cleanest.

Here is the predicted distribution for students at the **proficient** level with this specific "fear of algebra" profile:

proficient: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
