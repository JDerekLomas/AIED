As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option D**.

**The Reasoning:**
Leo is proficient and can intuitively see that $2 + 1 = 3$ and $1 + 2 = 3$. However, his "neatness" obsession is his undoing here. When he writes the fraction $\frac{3}{5}$, his disorganized layout often leads him to look at the two $5$s in the original denominators. His brain craves a "complete" transformation of all numbers visible. He will likely feel that leaving the denominator as a $5$ looks "unfinished" or "too simple." To make the solution look "logical" and utilize all the data on the page, he will add the denominators to get $10$. Once he has written $3 \frac{3}{10}$, it looks like a "neat," multi-step result. If he had any doubt and rubbed out his work, he would eventually settle on D because it "uses" the most numbers from the question.

He will avoid Option B because, despite it being mathematically equivalent, the instruction asks for a mixed number; Leo’s desire to follow rules (and his visual preference for the "shape" of a mixed number) makes B look "wrong" to him.

**Data Prediction:**
For students like Leo—proficient enough to perform the initial addition but prone to "logical-looking" errors under the stress of presentation and executive function slips:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=45% D=25%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=15% D=35%
**proficient: A=55% B=10% C=5% D=30%**
advanced: A=92% B=5% C=1% D=2%
