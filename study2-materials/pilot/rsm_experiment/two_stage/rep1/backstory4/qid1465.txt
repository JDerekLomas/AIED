Leo is highly likely to choose **Option B**.

As a proficient student who visualizes geometry well but struggles with the "clutter" of arithmetic, Leo will recognize the need for BIDMAS/Order of Operations. He will correctly calculate $4 \times 2 = 8$. However, his specific weakness with negative signs and his tendency to seek "neat" transitions will lead him astray in the second step. 

Because he is working quickly to avoid the frustration of a messy page, he is likely to mentally group the remaining numbers as $3 - (5 + 8)$ or, more commonly for students with his profile, he will perform the addition before the subtraction simply because it appears later in the string or creates a "cleaner" positive sum in his head. If he calculates $5 + 8 = 13$ and then sees the $3$ at the start, he may perform $3 - 13$, realize it’s "messy," and instead default to a "logical-looking" guess by flipping the operation to $5+3-8$ or mismanaging the signs during a frantic rub-out session. Most likely, he will do $3 - 5 = -2$, then add $8$ to get $6$ (Option A), but his specific dread of negatives often leads him to subtract the $2$ from the $8$ incorrectly or conflate the signs, leading him to **B**.
