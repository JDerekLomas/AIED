Leo is highly likely to choose **Option D**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s choice will be driven by his specific type of "frustrated perfectionism." For Problem Q, his proficient understanding of BIDMAS/Order of Operations will correctly guide him to $5 \times 6$. However, Problem P is a classic trap for students like Leo who rely on a rigid, literal interpretation of mnemonic aids to create "neat" logical structures. Because he visualises rules rather than fluid number lines, he likely recalls "A" (Addition) coming before "S" (Subtraction) in BIDMAS. 

Seeing the "+" sign in $5+6$ as a "priority" task provides him with a fixed starting point. When he attempts the calculation $4-11$, he will likely hit the "wall" of negative numbers that he dreads, rub out his work, and eventually just select Option D because it "looks" like the most sophisticated application of the rule he has memorised, even if the resulting arithmetic ($4-11$) makes him uncomfortable.
