Leo is highly likely to choose **C) $p=2$**.

**Reasoning:**
Leo’s primary hurdle is "neatness" over process. When faced with a fraction, he likely finds the formal algebraic step of multiplying both sides by $p$ to be messy or counter-intuitive. Because he is proficient, he understands that the numbers 10 and 5 have a relationship involving 2. 

His frustration with algebraic notation often leads him to simplify the problem mentally to something "cleaner." In his head, he likely flips the equation to $10 \div 5$ or $5 \times p = 10$. His "logical-looking guess" will favour the whole number because $0.5$ feels like a "fussy" decimal that doesn't fit his desire for a tidy result. He will see the 10 and the 5, decide the answer is 2, and write it down quickly to avoid the "mess" of rearranging the denominator.
