Based on my experience teaching students like Leo, he is highly likely to choose **Option D**.

**The Reasoning:**
Leo’s proficiency means he knows the method (FOIL or the grid method), but his frustration with "messy" signs is his downfall. He will correctly calculate $m^2$ and see the $12m$ resulting from $5+7$. However, because he likely rubbed out his working after misaligning the negative signs, he will default to what "looks" right. He often views a "minus times a minus" as staying minus (conceptually confusing it with addition), or he simply forgets to apply the sign rule to the final constant because he has lost track of the $(-5) \times (-7)$ calculation in his disorganized notes. Option D feels "neatest" to him because it maintains the negative theme of the original brackets.

**The Percentage Predictions:**
For students at the **proficient** level who struggle with organization and sign-retention like Leo:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=35% C=10% D=45%
advanced: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
