As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option A**.

**The Logic behind Leo's choice:**
Leo’s proficiency allows him to recognize that adding fractions requires a common denominator. He will likely identify that he needs to turn the second fraction into something with $2x$ on the bottom. He will correctly calculate $4 \times 2 = 8$. However, this is where his "neatness" frustration kicks in. 

Because he hates "messy" intermediate steps, Leo will try to do the mental jump: $3 + 8 = 11$. His disorganized handwriting usually causes him to lose track of the original denominator once he has transformed it mentally. He will see the $11$, see the $2x$, and rush to write it down to avoid a "messy" page of working out.

However, there is a significant risk he chooses **Option D**. If he hits that "frustration wall" where the $x$ starts looking like a cross or a smudge, he will abandon the common denominator rule entirely and simply add the numerators ($3+4=7$) while keeping the "most complex looking" denominator he can see ($2x$) to make it look like a "logical" algebraic answer. Given his tendency to scribble a guess based on the visible numbers, Option D is his "safe" retreat. 

But, because he is fundamentally **proficient**, his instinct for the "correct" process (finding the 11) usually wins out over the simple addition error, even if the layout is a disaster.
