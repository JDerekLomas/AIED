As Leo’s teacher, I predict he will choose **Option B (0.27)**.

**The Reasoning:**
Leo’s proficiency in visualization and geometry actually works against him here. When he sees $0.3$, his brain quickly jumps to "3 squared is 9." He will attempt to do the calculation mentally or with minimal scribbling to keep it "neat." 

He will likely calculate $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$ (or more likely, just see the "9"). Then, when multiplying by 3, he will reach $0.27$. However, the trap for Leo lies in his frustration with decimals. If he starts second-guessing the decimal placement, he will rub out his work. He will look at the numbers $3$ and $3$, see $3^2$ as 9, and $9 \times 3$ as 27. Option B looks "mathematically elegant" and "logical" compared to the other choices, fitting his habit of picking a guess that looks like it belongs to the numbers provided.

The danger for Leo is that if his rubbing out gets too aggressive, he might panic and choose **D (2.7)** because it "feels" like a more standard-sized answer, but his underlying proficiency usually guides him toward the correct digits, just with a misplaced decimal or a missed step.
