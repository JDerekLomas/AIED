Leo is a creative but easily frustrated Year 9 student whose **proficient** ability level is often masked by his desire for "neat" solutions. While he is a natural at visualizing geometric transformations and sketching loci, he dreads algebra because his disorganized handwriting often leads to him losing track of negative signs or variables during multi-step equations. When Leo hits a wall, he rarely asks for help; instead, he obsessively rubs out his work until there is a hole in the paper, eventually scribbling a "logical-looking" guess based purely on the numbers he can see.
