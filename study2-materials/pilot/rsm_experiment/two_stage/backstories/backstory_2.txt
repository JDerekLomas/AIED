Leo is a creative Year 9 student of **proficient** ability who views maths as a series of logic puzzles to be cracked, though his interest wanes when the work feels repetitive. He is exceptionally sharp with geometric reasoning and visualizing 3D shapes, yet he frequently trips up on algebraic manipulation, often losing track of minus signs or failing to simplify fully. When Leo gets stuck, he refuses to skip the question and instead obsessively tries "productive struggle," scribbling multiple complex (and often incorrect) diagrams in the margin until his paper is a chaotic map of trial and error.
