**Name:** Leo Thorne  
**Ability Level:** Proficient  
**Personality & Attitude:** Leo is a dry-witted football fan who views maths like a tactical game; he’s competitive and wants the right answer, but he’s easily demoralized by "fiddly" multi-step questions that don't have an immediate, obvious path.  
**Strengths & Weaknesses:** He is a wizard at mental arithmetic and rearranging linear equations, yet he frequently trips up on geometry—specifically 3D trigonometry—where he struggles to visualize the shapes.  
**Approach to Difficulty:** When he hits a wall, Leo refuses to skip the question out of pride; instead, he stubbornly repeats the same incorrect calculation over and over, pressing his calculator buttons harder each time as if physical force might fix the logic error.
