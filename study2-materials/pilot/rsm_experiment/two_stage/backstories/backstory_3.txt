**Name:** Leo Thorne  
**Ability Level:** Proficient  

Leo is a quiet, creative student who treats maths like a puzzle to be solved for his stop-motion animation hobby, though he finds the "dry" theory of the classroom slightly soul-crushing. While he is incredibly sharp with geometric transformations and 3D shapes, he frequently loses marks on simple algebraic expansions because his focus wavers during repetitive drills. When he hits a wall with a problem, he refuses to skip it and instead spends too much time obsessively scribbling complex, visual diagrams in the margins—often over-complicating a simple question by trying to visualize it from every angle before finally asking for a hint.
