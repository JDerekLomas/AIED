Lila Thorne is an artistically-minded Year 9 student with a **proficient** ability level, though she views maths as a "necessary evil" that interferes with her sketchbooking. She excels at visual geometry and complex transformations where she can see the patterns, but she frequently gets tripped up by multi-step algebraic equations involving negative numbers. When she hits a wall, Lila doesn’t guess; instead, she fills the margins of her page with elaborate, incorrect "scaffolding" diagrams, stubbornly trying to force a visual solution onto a purely numerical problem.
