As a UK maths teacher, I have seen these common misconceptions play out frequently in Key Stage 3 and GCSE classrooms. Here is my analysis of the distractors and the student distribution.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) $\frac{99}{20}$ (Correct magnitude, wrong format):**
    The student has successfully converted to improper fractions ($27/10 + 9/4$), found a common denominator of $20$, and added them correctly ($54/20 + 45/20 = 99/20$). However, they ignored the explicit instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
*   **B) $4 \frac{19}{20}$ (Correct):**
    The student added the integers ($2+2=4$) and found the common denominator for the fractions ($14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20$). They combined them correctly to form the mixed number.
*   **C) $\frac{99}{40}$ (Common denominator error):**
    Similar to option A, the student calculated the numerator correctly as $99$, but when adding fractions (after potentially cross-multiplying), they mistakenly added the denominators ($20+20$) or used the product $10 \times 4 = 40$ as the denominator without scaling the numerators correctly in the same step.
*   **D) $4 \frac{8}{14}$ (Add across/Lazy addition):**
    A very common low-ability misconception. The student added the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and then simply added the numerators ($7+1=8$) and added the denominators ($10+4=14$).

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK curriculum, **"Below Basic"** refers to students working at late Primary/Early KS3 level who struggle with fraction equivalence. **"Basic"** refers to Foundation GCSE students who know the rules but lack consistency. **"Proficient"** refers to Higher GCSE students who follow instructions well. **"Advanced"** refers to Grade 8/9 students.

| Ability Level | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 15% | 25% | 50% |
| **Basic** | 20% | 45% | 10% | 25% |
| **Proficient** | 25% | 70% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | 94% | 1% | 0% |

#### Teacher’s Notes on the distribution:
*   **Below Basic:** Most will gravitate towards **D** because "adding across" is the most intuitive "incorrect" method in mathematics.
*   **Basic:** Many students know how to find a common denominator but will fail to read the second half of the question. I expect a split between B and D here.
*   **Proficient:** These students rarely make the "add the denominators" mistake, but they often work quickly and provide the answer as an improper fraction (**A**), forgetting to convert back to a mixed number.
*   **Advanced:** Almost all should get this right, though a small percentage might still fall into the "improper fraction" trap if they are rushing to finish a paper.
