As a UK maths teacher, I see this specific question as a test of "order of operations in reverse" (solving equations) versus "multiplying through to clear fractions." It addresses common misconceptions regarding whether an operation must be applied to every term or just the result.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) Only Tom:** The student recognises that adding 5 to both sides is a valid first step ($\frac{x}{3} = 12 + 5 = 17$). They likely believe Katie is wrong because she "forgot to multiply the 5 by 3," which is a common (but context-dependent) rule students memorize.
*   **B) Only Katie:** The student correctly identifies that Katie has multiplied by 3. However, they fail to notice that she failed to multiply the "$-5$" term by 3. They think multiplying the $x$ term and the answer term is sufficient, falling into the "partial multiplication" trap.
*   **C) Both Tom and Katie:** The student recognises Tom’s "add 5 first" approach is correct. They also see Katie’s "multiply by 3" approach as a viable strategy for removing fractions but lack the fluency to check if she distributed the multiplication correctly across all terms.
*   **D) Neither is correct:** The student likely lacks a clear method for two-step equations or believes that because the methods look different, one *must* be fundamentally flawed, potentially overcomplicating the arithmetic of Tom's valid step.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions:

**Ability Level Descriptions:**
*   **Below Basic:** Struggles with basic inverse operations and equation structure.
*   **Basic:** Can solve one-step equations; knows "opposite of divide is multiply" but applies it inconsistently.
*   **Proficient:** Comfortable with two-step equations; prone to "forgetting the middle term" when multiplying through.
*   **Advanced:** Fully understands that any operation applied to an equation must be applied to the *entire* side (distributive property).

| Ability Level | A (Only Tom) | B (Only Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 35% | 30% | 15% |
| **Basic** | 35% | 20% | 40% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 65% | 10% | 22% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 94% | 1% | 4% | 1% |

**Teacher’s Note on the Analysis:**
The "distractor" here is Katie. To many students, Katie’s working *looks* like a standard "clear the fraction" step. The error Katie made ($x - 5 = 36$ instead of $x - 15 = 36$) is one of the most persistent errors in GCSE Foundation-level algebra. **Option A is the only correct answer** because Tom correctly adds 5 to both sides. Katie’s method is only "correct" if she multiplies *every* term by 3. Because she didn't, her line is mathematically incorrect.
