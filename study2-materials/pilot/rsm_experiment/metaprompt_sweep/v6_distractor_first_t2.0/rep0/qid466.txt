As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently when testing students on their understanding of fractions, reciprocals, and the rules of directed numbers (integers).

### Step 1 — Analysis of Options

**A) $\frac{4}{3}$ [Correct Reasoning]**
To get a product of $1$ when multiplying by a fraction, you must multiply by its reciprocal (the multiplicative inverse). To get a product of $-1$ when starting with a negative value, you must multiply by a **positive** value ($negative \times positive = negative$). Therefore, the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$ is needed, and the sign must be positive.

**B) $-\frac{4}{3}$ [Misconception of Signs]**
The student correctly identifies the need for a reciprocal to reach the integer 1 but forgets the rule for multiplying directed numbers. They see the negative sign in the question and assume the answer must also be negative, or they are thinking of the "negative reciprocal" (perpendicular gradients in geometry) rather than the multiplicative inverse.

**C) $\frac{3}{4}$ [Confusion with Identity]**
The student recognizes that the sign must be positive to maintain the negative result, but they do not understand that a product of 1 requires a reciprocal. They may be confusing the property with the additive inverse or simply guessing based on the numbers already visible in the equation.

**D) $-\frac{3}{4}$ [Lack of understanding]**
The student likely sees the $-1$ and assumes they need another negative to "keep things consistent" or believes that multiplying a fraction by itself is the way to reach a whole number. This is often a "pattern matching" error where they just pick the number they already see.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

I have categorised the ability levels based on the UK 9-1 GCSE grading tiers (Below Basic: Grade 1-2; Basic: Grade 3-4; Proficient: Grade 5-6; Advanced: Grade 7-9).

**below_basic:** A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%  
*At this level, students struggle with both the concept of a reciprocal and the rules for multiplying negative numbers. Option B and D are very common "distractors" because they look similar to the question.*

**basic:** A=40% B=35% C=15% D=10%  
*Students often remember they need to "flip the fraction," but many will fall into the trap of Option B. They often associate a "negative answer" with a "negative operation" without checking the product rule ($-\times- = +$).*

**proficient:** A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%  
*Students at this level are generally secure in their reciprocal knowledge. The main source of error here will be rushing and selecting B because they are used to finding perpendicular gradients in coordinate geometry, where $-\frac{1}{m}$ is the rule.*

**advanced:** A=96% B=3% C=1% D=0%  
*Advanced students should find this trivial. The only errors will be due to extreme carelessness or misreading the question as equal to $+1$ rather than $-1$.*
