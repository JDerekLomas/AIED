As a UK maths teacher, I frequently see this specific type of error when students handle multi-step linear equations. The "mis-operation" in Step 2 is a classic hallmark of students who have memorised the idea of "moving things to the other side" but have not mastered inverse operations.

### Step 1 — Analysis of Reasoning

*   **A) Only step 1:** The student correctly identifies that Step 1 is valid (multiplying both sides by 4). They also correctly identify that in Step 2, Isaac should have subtracted 1 from 60 ($60 - 1 = 59$) rather than adding it. This shows a firm grasp of inverse operations.
*   **B) Only step 2:** This is a rare choice. A student might choose this if they mistakenly think Step 1 is wrong (perhaps thinking you should subtract 1 first, ignoring the fraction bar as a grouping symbol) but believe $61 = k$ is a "reasonable" result for $1 + k$.
*   **C) Both steps are correct:** The student understands the first step of clearing the fraction. However, in Step 2, they fall into the "matching sign" trap—seeing a $+1$ and instinctively adding 1 to the other side ($60+1$) instead of performing the inverse operation (subtraction). 
*   **D) Both steps are incorrect:** The student likely lacks an understanding of how to handle equations with fractions. They may think the 4 should be subtracted or that the 1 must be moved before the 4, erroneously believing the multiplication in Step 1 was an illegal move.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, **below_basic** refers to students working at Foundation Tier Grade 1–2, **basic** to Grade 3–4, **proficient** to Grade 5–6 (Higher/Foundation crossover), and **advanced** to Grade 7–9.

**below_basic:** 
A=15% B=10% C=45% D=30%
*(These students often struggle with the order of operations in fractions and frequently guess D or follow the addition sign in Step 2 to pick C.)*

**basic:** 
A=35% B=5% C=50% D=10%
*(This group represents the highest peak for Option C; they can clear a denominator but consistently fail to use the inverse sign when 'moving' a constant.)*

**proficient:** 
A=75% B=2% C=20% D=3%
*(Most proficient students will spot the addition error in Step 2. Those who miss it usually do so through haste rather than a lack of knowledge.)*

**advanced:** 
A=96% B=0% C=4% D=0%
*(Errors here are almost exclusively due to "reading what they expect to see" rather than a misunderstanding of the algebra.)*
