As an experienced teacher, I recognize this question as a test of a student’s ability to substitute a value into a linear equation, particularly one presented in the form $ax + by = c$ rather than the explicit $y = mx + c$.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

**A) 20:**
This error usually stems from "operational detachment." The student sees $4, x$ (which is $0$), and $2$. They multiply $4 \times 0 = 0$, but then mistakenly multiply $10 \times 2$ (the coefficient of $y$) or perform $4 \times (2+3)$ type logic. More commonly, students at this level often associate "tables" with multiplication and just pick a multiple of 10.

**B) 3:**
This is the "column skip" or "sequence" error. Students assume the table is a pattern. If they were to solve for $x=1$, they would get $y=3$. A student might calculate the value for $x=1$ first, or simply assume the $y$ values must start from a lower number and "work up" to 10.

**C) 5:**
**This is the correct reasoning.** The student substitutes $x=0$ into $4x + 2y = 10$.
$4(0) + 2y = 10$
$0 + 2y = 10$
$y = 10 \div 2 = 5$.

**D) 2.5:**
This is a "coefficient division" error. The student ignores the $y$ entirely and treats the equation as $4x = 10$ (leading to $x=2.5$) or simply divides 10 by 4, perhaps confusing which coefficient belongs to which variable when $x$ is 0.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK curriculum, "below basic" students often struggle with the concept that $4x$ means $4 \times x$, while "proficient" students handle the substitution but may make an algebraic slip.

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level often guess based on the numbers visible ($10$ and $2$) or fail to substitute $0$ correctly.
*   **Basic:** They understand substitution but often struggle with two-step equations, sometimes just dividing $10$ by $4$ (Option D).
*   **Proficient:** These students will identify that $4x$ becomes $0$ and successfully solve $2y=10$.
*   **Advanced:** This is a "low-floor" question for these students; errors will be strictly due to over-confidence/speed.
