As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on the national curriculum standards for Key Stage 3 and GCSE, where the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) is a fundamental part of the number system.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

**A) $6$ (Correct)**
The student correctly follows the order of operations (Multiplication before Addition/Subtraction). They calculate $4 \times 2 = 8$, then follow the expression from left to right: $3 - 5 = -2$, and $-2 + 8 = 6$. Alternatively, they may do $3 + 8 - 5 = 6$.

**B) $4$ (Subtraction vs Addition error)**
The student correctly prioritises multiplication ($4 \times 2 = 8$), resulting in $3 - 5 + 8$. However, they succumb to the common "Addition before Subtraction" myth of BIDMAS. They see $5 + 8$ as a block, resulting in $3 - 13 = -10$. Or, more likely for this specific result, they calculate $3 - 5 = -2$ but then incorrectly combine $-2$ and $+8$ by simply finding the difference without regard for the negative sign's impact, or make a basic arithmetic slip.

**C) $-12$ (Left-to-right error)**
The student ignores the order of operations entirely and works strictly from left to right:
$3 - 5 = -2$
$-2 + 4 = 2$
$2 \times 2 = 4$ (Note: This logic actually leads to $4$, so $-12$ is more likely derived from $(3 - 5 - 4) \times 2$, a confusion of signs). Actually, $-12$ often comes from students doing $(3 - (5+4)) \times 2 = (3-9) \times 2 = -12$.

**D) $-10$ (Strict BIDMAS Misinterpretation)**
This is the most common "sophisticated" error. The student remembers that 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS. They calculate $4 \times 2 = 8$ first. Then they do the addition: $5 + 8 = 13$. Finally, they do the subtraction: $3 - 13 = -10$. This demonstrates knowledge of the acronym but a failure to understand that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions:

In the UK system, **Below Basic** refers to students working at a low Primary level; **Basic** refers to Foundation GCSE level (Grades 1-3); **Proficient** refers to Higher GCSE level (Grades 4-6); **Advanced** refers to students targeting Grades 7-9 or A-Level.

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Calc Error) | C (Left-to-Right) | D (Strict BIDMAS) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 20% | 40% | 25% |
| **Basic** | 40% | 10% | 15% | 35% |
| **Proficient** | 75% | 5% | 5% | 15% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0% | 1% |

**Teacher Commentary:**
The jump between 'Basic' and 'Proficient' is usually where students stop treating 'BIDMAS' as a rigid six-step ladder and start viewing it as a four-level hierarchy (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). Option D is a very "sticky" misconception that even bright students occasionally revert to under exam pressure.
