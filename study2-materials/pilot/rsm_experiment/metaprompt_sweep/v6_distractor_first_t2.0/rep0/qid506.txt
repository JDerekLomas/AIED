As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in GCSE Foundation and higher-tier starter sets. It tests the ability to manipulate fractions when solving one-step linear equations.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) \( p=\frac{1}{4} \)**
    Students often see the numbers 3 and 12 and perform the operation \(12 \div 3 = 4\). They ignore the reciprocal nature of the fraction and simply place the result in the denominator, or they mistakenly "cancel" the 3 into the 12 while leaving the numerator as 1.
*   **B) Correct Reasoning: \( p=\frac{1}{36} \)**
    To solve \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\), one must divide both sides by 3. Dividing a fraction by an integer is equivalent to multiplying the denominator by that integer: \(p = \frac{1}{12 \times 3} = \frac{1}{36}\).
*   **C) \( p=4 \)**
    This is a classic "number bond" error. The student identifies the relationship between 3 and 12, ignoring the fraction entirely. They multiply \(12 \times \frac{1}{3}\) or divide \(12 \div 3\) but fail to account for the fact that 12 was a denominator.
*   **D) \( p=\frac{1}{9} \)**
    This usually comes from a "tripled error." A student might misread the equation as involving a square root or simply get confused and multiply the 3 by 3 (incorrectly attempting to square the coefficient) rather than multiplying the denominator. It is also sometimes chosen by students who try to make the denominators "even" or multiples of 3 but perform the arithmetic poorly.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

The difficulty here lies in the cognitive load of "dividing a fraction by a whole number," which is a common stumbling block in Key Stage 3 and early GCSE preparation.

*   **Below Basic:** Students who struggle with algebraic notation and basic fraction operations.
    **A=40% B=15% C=35% D=10%**
    *(Most will gravitate toward A or C because they feel 12 and 3 must result in a 4 somehow.)*

*   **Basic:** Students who understand they must divide, but fail on the execution of the fraction arithmetic.
    **A=45% B=25% C=20% D=10%**
    *(Option A is a very "sticky" distractor here; it looks mathematically plausible to a student who knows the answer involves 4 but is shaky on rules of division.)*

*   **Proficient:** Students who are comfortable with one-step equations but might make a hasty error under time pressure.
    **A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%**
    *(Most have mastered "dividing by 3 means multiplying the denominator," but the "divide 12 by 3" impulse still catches some.)*

*   **Advanced:** Students with high fluency in algebraic manipulation.
    **A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%**
    *(Rarely fooled; usually only misses the correct answer due to misreading the question as \(p/3 = 1/12\).)*
