As a UK maths teacher, I frequently see these specific misconceptions when teaching Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). This question is a classic "trap" because it tests both the priority of multiplication over addition and the left-to-right rule for addition and subtraction.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) Problem P: $4-5$; Problem Q: $4+5$**
    Reasoning: The student reads strictly from left to right for both problems, ignoring the priority rules of BIDMAS altogether. They see addition and subtraction as the same level and multiplication and addition as the same level.
*   **B) Problem P: $4-5$; Problem Q: $5 \times 6$ (Correct Answer)**
    Reasoning: The student correctly applies BIDMAS. In Problem P, Addition and Subtraction have equal priority, so they work left-to-right. In Problem Q, Multiplication takes precedence over Addition.
*   **C) Problem P: $5+6$; Problem Q: $4+5$**
    Reasoning: This is a "strict BIDMAS" error combined with a left-to-right error. The student thinks 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, so they *must* add before they subtract (often resulting in $4 - 11 = -7$). In Problem Q, they default to left-to-right.
*   **D) Problem P: $5+6$; Problem Q: $5 \times 6$**
    Reasoning: This is the most common misconception among mid-range students. They know BIDMAS exists (hence $5 \times 6$ first), but they take the acronym literally, believing that Addition **must** be performed before Subtraction. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the "equal priority" of the A and S in the hierarchy.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

**Below Basic**
*Students at this level often lack familiarity with the BIDMAS acronym or ignore it in favor of the way we read (left-to-right).*
**A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%**

**Basic**
*Students at this level have heard of BIDMAS but are highly susceptible to taking the letters literally or applying it inconsistently. Option D is a very popular "sophisticated" error here.*
**A=25% B=30% C=10% D=35%**

**Proficient**
*These students generally understand that Multiplication beats Addition, but many still fall into the trap of doing Addition before Subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym.*
**A=5% B=55% C=5% D=35%**

**Advanced**
*These students understand that Addition/Subtraction are a "rank" and are solved left-to-right, and Multiplication is a higher "rank". They should navigate this easily.*
**A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%**
