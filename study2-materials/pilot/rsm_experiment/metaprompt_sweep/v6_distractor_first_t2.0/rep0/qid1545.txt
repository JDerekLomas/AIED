As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this question as a classic test of **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)**. It specifically targets the common misconception that expressions should be read strictly from left to right.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) $>$ (Correct Reasoning):** The student follows BIDMAS correctly.
    *   Left side: $12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8 + 3 = 11$.
    *   Right side: $(8 + 12) = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.
    *   Since $11 > 5$, the symbol is $>$.
*   **B) $<$ (Incorrect Reasoning):** The student incorrectly prioritizes the addition on the left side (perhaps thinking addition comes before division or simply working left-to-right), but calculates the right side correctly.
    *   Left side: $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.
    *   Right side: $(8 + 12) = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.
    *   The student may then make a slight computational error or misinterpret the "balance," feeling the bracketed side is "heavier" or "more important," leading to selecting $<$.
*   **C) $=$ (Common Misconception):** The student ignores BIDMAS/brackets and treats both sides as the same numbers in the same general sequence. They likely calculate the left side as $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$, making both sides equal to 5. This is the most common error among UK Key Stage 3 students.
*   **D) $\geq$ (Partial Understanding/Guessing):** The student recognizes that the left side is larger than or equal to the right side (likely having calculated 11 and 5), but lacks the mathematical maturity to realize that "Greater Than" is the precise answer required, or they are overcomplicating the logic.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

**Teacher’s Note on Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students struggling with basic operations and no grasp of BIDMAS.
*   **Basic:** Students who have heard of BIDMAS but revert to left-to-right processing under pressure.
*   **Proficient:** Students who generally apply BIDMAS correctly but may make a "slip" under exam conditions.
*   **Advanced:** Students with high fluency who instinctively check for order of operations.

| Ability Level | A ($>$) | B ($<$) | C ($=$) | D ($\geq$) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 20% | 60% | 5% |
| **Basic** | 30% | 10% | 55% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 75% | 5% | 18% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 1% | 0% |

**Analysis of Distribution:** 
Option **C** is a powerful distractor for students in the "Basic" and "Below Basic" categories. In my experience, roughly half of a standard Year 7 or 8 cohort will initially say these expressions are equal because they do not "see" the division having priority over the addition on the left-hand side. The jump to **Proficient** is marked by the consistent internalisation of the priority of division.
