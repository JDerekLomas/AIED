As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in GCSE Higher and Foundation tiers. It tests three distinct areas: basic multiplication, the definition of an exponent, and the rules of directed numbers (specifically even powers of negative bases).

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) 81 (Correct):** The student understands that $T = (-3)^4 = (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$. They correctly identify that a negative multiplied by a negative is a positive, resulting in $+9 \times +9 = 81$.
*   **B) 12:** This is a common "operation confusion" error. The student multiplies the base by the exponent ($3 \times 4$ or $-3 \times 4$) and ignores the negative sign or considers absolute value.
*   **C) -81:** This is the most common "sophisticated" error. The student knows $3^4 = 81$ but incorrectly assumes that if the base is negative, the result must be negative. It also mirrors how many scientific calculators will output $-81$ if the student types $-3^4$ without using brackets.
*   **D) -12:** A combination of the errors in B and C. The student multiplies the base by the power ($3 \times 4$) and maintains the negative sign from the base.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

I have categorized "Below Basic" as KS3 students or lower-tier Foundation students, and "Advanced" as Grade 8/9 GCSE or A-Level students.

*   **Below Basic:** Many students here treat algebra as simple multiplication and have a weak grasp of powers.
    *   **A=15% B=40% C=15% D=30%**
*   **Basic:** Students recognize the exponent but often make sign errors or fall for the "calculator trap" of not using brackets for negatives.
    *   **A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%**
*   **Proficient:** These students rarely make the "3 times 4" mistake but can still be tripped up by the rule that even powers of negative numbers result in a positive.
    *   **A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%**
*   **Advanced:** Students at this level have internalized the rules of indices and directed numbers.
    *   **A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%**

### Teacher’s Note:
Option **C** is the most significant distractor for mid-to-high ability students. In a classroom setting, I would use this result to highlight the importance of brackets when substituting: $T = (-3)^4$ vs $T = -3^4$.
