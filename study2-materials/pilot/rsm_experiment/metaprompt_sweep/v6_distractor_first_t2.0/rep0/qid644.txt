As a UK maths teacher, I encounter this specific hurdle frequently when teaching algebraic expansion (FOIL/Grid method). This question specifically tests the interaction of directed numbers and the distinction between multiplication and addition.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) +4:** **Correct reasoning.** The student identifies that they must multiply $-1$ and $-4$. They correctly apply the sign rule that a "negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive" ($1 \times 4 = 4$).
*   **B) -4:** **Partial misconception (Signs).** The student knows to multiply $1 \times 4$ to get $4$, but they either forget to multiply the signs or believe that "a negative and a negative stay negative" (confusing multiplication rules with addition rules).
*   **C) +5:** **Misconception (Operation).** The student understands the negative sign rule ($- \times - = +$) but performs addition instead of multiplication ($1 + 4 = 5$). 
*   **D) -5:** **Misconception (Operation & Signs).** The student performs addition instead of multiplication and treats it as a debt calculation: $-1$ combined with $-4$ equals $-5$. This is a very common "working memory" error where the word "and" leads them to add the terms.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

I have categorised "Ability Levels" based on typical UK secondary school progress (e.g., Year 9 or GCSE Foundation/Higher students).

| Ability Level | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 25% | 20% | 40% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 30% | 10% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 80% | 15% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0.5% | 0.5% |

**Teacher’s Commentary on the Distributions:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level struggle with the instruction "expand." Even with arrows, they often default to the simplest arithmetic operation they see (addition). They often view $-1$ and $-4$ as a sum to be completed rather than a product.
*   **Basic:** These students know they should multiply (eliminating C and D), but they are highly susceptible to the "sign error." Roughly 1 in 3 will simply "carry the sign down" or forget that the multiplication of two negatives results in a positive.
*   **Proficient:** These students have mastered the mechanics of FOIL/Grid method. Errors here are usually "slip" errors (copying the sign wrong) rather than conceptual ones.
*   **Advanced:** Students at this level will find this trivial; the only reason they would get it wrong is due to extreme haste or a misread of the digit.
