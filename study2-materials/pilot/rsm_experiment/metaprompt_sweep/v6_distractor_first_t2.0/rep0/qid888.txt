As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen hundreds of students tackle the "FOIL" method or grid method for expanding double brackets. This specific question tests two things: the ability to combine like terms ($m$) and, most crucially, the ability to multiply and add directed numbers (negatives).

### Step 1 — Analysis of Reasoning

*   **A) $m^{2}-2 m-35$**
    This student likely performed the expansion but struggled with integer addition. They correctly did $-5 \times -7$ but arrived at $-35$ (a sign error) and calculated $-7 + 5$ or $|-7 + 5|$ to get $-2m$, or they simply found the *difference* between 7 and 5 rather than the sum.
*   **B) $m^{2}-12 m+35$**
    **Correct Reasoning.** The student multiplied $m \times m = m^2$, handled the outer and inner terms $(-7m - 5m = -12m)$, and correctly identified that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive $(-5 \times -7 = +35)$.
*   **C) $m^{2}+12 m+35$**
    This student understands the structure of the expansion but is ignoring the signs of the coefficients. They have treated $(m-5)(m-7)$ as if it were $(m+5)(m+7)$, essentially ignoring the negative signs attached to the 5 and 7 during the addition phase.
*   **D) $m^{2}-12 m-35$**
    This is the most common "near-miss" error. The student correctly calculated the middle term $(-5m - 7m = -12m)$ but made a very common mistake with the constant term, thinking that "a negative and a negative make a negative" regardless of whether they are adding or multiplying (i.e., $-5 \times -7 = -35$).

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In a typical UK secondary school (Key Stage 3 or GCSE), these would be the likely distributions:

**below_basic (Working toward Grade 3):**
*Students at this level often struggle with the grid method and frequently make mistakes with negative signs.*
A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%

**basic (Grade 4):**
*Students can expand the brackets but are highly susceptible to the 'negative times a negative equals a negative' misconception.*
A=15% B=40% C=10% D=35%

**proficient (Grade 5/6):**
*Students are mostly fluent with the FOIL/Grid method and usually remember the sign rules for multiplication, though some slip-ups occur.*
A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%

**advanced (Grade 7+):**
*Students have high fluency with quadratic expansions and rarely make arithmetic errors.*
A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
