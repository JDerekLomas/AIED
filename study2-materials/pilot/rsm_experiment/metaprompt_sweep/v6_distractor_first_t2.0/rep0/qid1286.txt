As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific question as a classic test of **rearranging formulae** combined with recall of **geometric measures**. This is typically a Higher Tier GCSE topic (Levels 6–9).

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

**A) \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V\pi}{3}}\)**
*   **Reasoning:** The student understands a cube root is needed but has poor algebraic manipulation skills. Instead of dividing by the coefficient \(\frac{4}{3}\pi\), they have multiplied $V$ by the numerator ($4\pi$) and divided by the denominator ($3$). Essentially, they have moved parts of the formula across the equals sign without performing the inverse operation.

**B) \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}\)**
*   **Reasoning:** The student correctly identifies that the $\pi$ should be in the denominator, but they have incorrectly inverted the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$. They have likely thought "the 4 stays on top, the 3 stays on bottom," failing to realize that to isolate $r^3$, you must multiply by 3 and divide by 4.

**C) \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\)**
*   **Reasoning (Correct):** The student starts with $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. They multiply by 3 ($3V = 4\pi r^3$), divide by $4\pi$ ($\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$), and then take the cube root. This shows strong mastery of multi-step algebraic manipulation.

**D) \(\frac{3\sqrt[3]{V}}{4\pi}\)**
*   **Reasoning:** The student recognizes that $V$ needs to be rooted, but they are applying the cube root *only* to the $V$ and then treating the remaining coefficients as a linear fraction to be attached afterwards. This is a common "notational" error where the student doesn't realize the root must apply to the entire isolated expression.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK context, "Below Basic" equates to Foundation tier students (Grades 1-3), "Basic" to Grade 4-5, "Proficient" to Grade 6-7, and "Advanced" to Grade 8-9.

| Ability Level | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 35% | 30% | 10% | 25% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 25% | 35% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 10% | 15% | 70% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 3% | 94% | 1% |

**Teacher’s Notes on the distribution:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many students at this level struggle to recall the volume of a sphere formula correctly (often confusing it with the area of a circle), and if provided the formula, they often "guess" based on which expression "looks" like the original numbers.
*   **Basic:** This group often makes the mistake in Option B; they know $\pi$ goes on the bottom but lack the fractional arithmetic to flip $4/3$ into $3/4$.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually get it right, but a significant portion will fall for the "look" of Option B because it keeps the 4 on top of the 3, which matches the visual structure of the original formula.
*   **Advanced:** Only a "silly slip" in transposition or a misreading of the power/root symbol would lead an advanced student away from Option C.
