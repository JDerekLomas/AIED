As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of linear substitution question frequently in GCSE Foundation and higher tiers. The primary hurdles for students are the manipulation of negative numbers and the order of operations when rearranging equations.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) 3.3:** This is the **correct** answer. 
    Substituting $y = 0.5$ gives $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, which simplifies to $10x - 3 = 30$. Adding 3 to both sides gives $10x = 33$, and dividing by 10 results in $x = 3.3$.
*   **B) 2.7:** This is the most common **procedural error**. 
    Students correctly substitute to get $10x - 3 = 30$, but then subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it ($10x = 27$). This stems from a misunderstanding of inverse operations.
*   **C) 4.25:** This error stems from **incorrectly substituting** the $0.5$ for the $x$ instead of the $y$. 
    If a student calculates $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$, they get $5 - 6y = 30$, which leads to $-6y = 25$. $25 \div 6$ is roughly 4.16, but students often miscalculate the division or transpose $10 \times 0.5$ to the other side and divide the result ($30+5=35$ or $30-5=25$) by $6$ or $8$. It also represents a "guessing" zone for students who don't know where to start but see "30" and "0.5" and try to divide.
*   **D) -4.25:** This is a **sign error combined with incorrect substitution**. 
    The student substitutes for $x$ and then struggles with the resulting negative coefficient for $y$, often losing a negative sign during the division process.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

I have categorised "ability levels" based on typical GCSE grade boundaries (Below Basic = Grade 1-2, Basic = Grade 3-4, Proficient = Grade 5-6, Advanced = Grade 7+).

| Ability Level | A (3.3) | B (2.7) | C (4.25) | D (-4.25) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 35% | 30% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 40% | 45% | 10% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 80% | 15% | 3% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 1% | 0% |

**Teacher's Commentary on the Distributions:**
*   **Below Basic** students often look at the table and assume $x$ must be the value being substituted (top row input bias), leading to C and D. They also struggle heavily with the inverse operation of $+3$.
*   **Basic** students are the "danger zone" for option B. They know they need to substitute $y$, but they "move the 3 over" and subconsciously subtract it because they see a minus sign in the original equation and lose track of the balancing method.
*   **Proficient** students usually navigate the substitution well but may occasionally make a "silly mistake" with a quick mental subtraction ($30-3$ instead of $30+3$).
*   **Advanced** students should find this trivial and only miss it through a genuine transcription error.
