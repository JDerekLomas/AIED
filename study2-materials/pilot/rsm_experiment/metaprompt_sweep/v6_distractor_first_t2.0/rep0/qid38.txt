As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of algebraic fraction question frequently in GCSE Higher and Foundation tiers. It tests the ability to find a common denominator where one denominator is a multiple of the other.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) Correct Reasoning:** To add $\frac{3}{2x}$ and $\frac{4}{x}$, the student finds a common denominator of $2x$. They multiply the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$ to get $\frac{8}{2x}$. Adding the numerators ($3 + 8$) gives $11$, resulting in $\mathbf{\frac{11}{2x}}$.
*   **B) Add numerators, add denominators:** The student follows the classic "freshman's dream" error. They add the numerators ($3+4=7$) and add the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). This is common among students who confuse the rules of addition with a distorted version of multiplication rules.
*   **C) Incorrect Common Denominator/Numerator work:** The student recognizes they need to double the second fraction to get $8$, but then decides the final denominator should be $x$ instead of $2x$, or they mistakenly "cancel" the 2 during the process.
*   **D) Adding Numerators only:** The student correctly identifies $2x$ as a common denominator (or keeps the more complex one) but forgets to adjust the numerator of the second fraction. They simply calculate $3 + 4 = 7$, leading to $\frac{7}{2x}$.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK school system, "below_basic" represents students working at Grades 1-2, "basic" at Grades 3-4, "proficient" at Grades 5-6, and "advanced" at Grades 7-9.

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the concept of common denominators even in numerical fractions, leading to high rates of simply adding across the top and bottom.
*   **Basic:** Students here know they need a common denominator but often forget to scale the numerator (leading to D) or still fall back on the additive shortcut (B).
*   **Proficient:** These students have mastered the process but occasionally make "slip" errors under time pressure.
*   **Advanced:** Mastery is expected; errors are extremely rare and usually down to simple misreads.

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **below_basic** | 15% | 55% | 10% | 20% |
| **basic** | 45% | 20% | 5% | 30% |
| **proficient** | 80% | 5% | 2% | 13% |
| **advanced** | 97% | 1% | 1% | 1% |

**Teacher's Note:** Option D is the most "dangerous" distractor for mid-tier students because it *looks* like they have dealt with the denominator correctly, providing a false sense of security while ignoring the equivalence of the second fraction.
