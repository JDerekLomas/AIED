As an experienced GCSE Maths teacher, I see these types of linear equation problems frequently. They test three distinct skills: substitution, handling directed numbers (negative signs), and algebraic manipulation.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) 3.3 (Correct Reasoning):** The student substitutes $y = 0.5$ correctly: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30$. They then correctly add 3 to both sides to get $10x = 33$, leading to $x = 3.3$.
*   **B) 2.7 (Sign Error in Rearranging):** The student substitutes $y = 0.5$ correctly to get $10x - 3 = 30$, but then makes an error in inverse operations. Instead of adding 3, they subtract 3: $10x = 27$, leading to $x = 2.7$.
*   **C) 4.25 (Inverse Substitution / Coefficient Swap):** The student incorrectly substitutes the $0.5$ into $x$ instead of $y$, or confuses the coefficients. If they mistakenly use the equation as $6y - 10x = 30$ and solve for $y$ given $x=0.5$, they may arrive at numbers in this range. More commonly, this represents a guess based on "adding 6 and 0.5" or similar decimal confusion.
*   **D) -4.25 (Incorrect Negative Handling):** The student follows the logic of option C but introduces a sign error during the subtraction phase, often assuming the 30 must become negative because the original equation has a minus sign.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, **Below Basic** (Foundation Grade 1-2) students often struggle with the structure of a table of values and substitution. **Basic** (Grade 3-4) students can substitute but frequently make sign errors. **Proficient** (Grade 5-6) students usually follow the process but might slip on the inverse operation. **Advanced** (Grade 7+) should find this trivial.

**below_basic:** A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%
*(Logic: High guessing rate; many will subtract 3 from 30 because they see a minus sign and think 'opposite', leading them to 2.7 or 4.25.)*

**basic:** A=40% B=35% C=15% D=10%
*(Logic: Substitution is likely correct, but the error $30 - 3 = 27$ is the "classic" mistake at this level when rearranging $10x - 3 = 30$.)*

**proficient:** A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%
*(Logic: Most will add 3 correctly to get 33. The few who miss it will almost exclusively choose 2.7 due to a careless subtraction error.)*

**advanced:** A=96% B=3% C=1% D=0%
*(Logic: Very high accuracy; the only errors would be rapid mental maths slips resulting in B.)*
