As a UK maths teacher, I would identify this as a typical "Change of Subject" problem within the context of GCSE Geometry (Higher Tier). This specific question tests both the recall of the sphere volume formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) and the algebraic skill required to isolate $r$.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning for each option

*   **A) Reasoning:** The student correctly identifies the formula but makes a common error in algebraic manipulation. When moving the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$, they have multiplied both sides by 4 and divided by 3, effectively treating it as $\frac{3}{4}V = \dots$ incorrectly, or they simply paired the $4\pi$ and the $3$ on the wrong sides of the fraction.
*   **B) Reasoning:** The student remembers the numbers 4, 3, and $\pi$, but believes that because $\pi$ is "usually on top," it should stay there during the division. They have correctly multiplied by 3 and divided by 4, but left $\pi$ in the denominator erroneously or failed to move it at all. 
*   **C) Reasoning: (Correct)** The student correctly recalls $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. They multiply by 3 to get $3V = 4\pi r^3$, then divide by $4\pi$ to get $\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$. Finally, they take the cube root of the entire expression.
*   **D) Reasoning:** This student likely knows that a cube root is involved but has poor notation and algebraic priority skills. They may have attempted to "root" the $V$ first and then move the coefficients over as a simple linear fraction, or they are guessing based on the components of the formula without applying operations to both sides.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

I have categorized the students based on the typical UK grading system (Below Basic = Grade 1-3, Basic = Grade 4-5, Proficient = Grade 6-7, Advanced = Grade 8-9).

**Below Basic (Likely Foundation Tier students struggling with rearranging):**
*A=30% B=25% C=15% D=30%*
(These students often struggle to remember the sphere formula without a formula sheet and will guess based on which "looks" most like a maths formula.)

**Basic (Standard Pass students):**
*A=25% B=20% C=35% D=20%*
(They likely know the formula but will fail at the multi-step rearrangement, often flipping the fraction 4/3 incorrectly.)

**Proficient (Strong GCSE candidates):**
*A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%*
(Most can rearrange the formula correctly, though a significant minority will make a "silly mistake" with the position of $\pi$ or the 3/4 fraction.)

**Advanced (A* / Grade 8-9 candidates):**
*A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%*
(These students should find this trivial. The 5% margin accounts for pure transcription errors or rushing under exam pressure.)
