As a UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle binomial expansion. This specific question focuses on two key "stumbling blocks": the multiplication of directed numbers (negative times a negative) and the confusion between multiplying and adding terms.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) $+4$**: This is the **correct reasoning**. The student identifies that they must multiply the constant terms $(-1)$ and $(-4)$. They correctly apply the rule that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive.
*   **B) $-4$**: This reasoning suggests the student knows to multiply ($1 \times 4$), but they have a **misconception about directed numbers**. They might believe that "a negative and a negative stay negative," or they may have simply neglected the sign of the first term.
*   **C) $+5$**: This is a **procedural error**. Instead of multiplying the terms as required by the "FOIL" or grid method for expanding brackets, the student has **added** them ($ -1 + -4 = -5 $) but then made a further error with the sign (thinking two negatives make a positive in addition).
*   **D) $-5$**: This is a common **operation confusion**. The student has **added** the terms instead of multiplying them ($-1 - 4 = -5$). This is a very common mistake for students who are used to simplifying expressions and forget the "expansion" context implies multiplication.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

I have categorised "ability levels" based on typical UK secondary school performance (GCSE grades 1-9).

*   **Below Basic** (Working towards Grade 1-2): These students often confuse operations and struggle with negative number rules.
*   **Basic** (Grade 3-4): These students know they should multiply but often fail the "double negative" rule.
*   **Proficient** (Grade 5-6): These students are solid with negatives but might make a "slip" under pressure.
*   **Advanced** (Grade 7-9): These students have mastered the distributive law and directed numbers.

| Ability Level | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 25% | 20% | 35% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 35% | 5% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 10% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0% | 1% |

**Teacher's Commentary:**
Option **D** is the biggest distractor for lower-ability students because the brain often defaults to "combining" numbers rather than multiplying them when the numbers are small. Option **B** remains a persistent "slip" even for mid-level students who understand the concept but lack fluency in integer arithmetic.
