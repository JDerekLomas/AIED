As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific question frequently in Year 7 and 8 assessments. It tests three distinct skills: finding a common denominator, performing the addition, and following the instruction regarding the format of the answer (mixed number vs. improper fraction).

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

**A) \( \frac{99}{20} \)**
The student has calculated the correct value but failed to read the final instruction. They converted both to improper fractions ($\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$), but did not convert back to the requested "mixed number" format.

**B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \) [CORRECT]**
The student correctly identified a common denominator (likely 20). 
$2 \frac{14}{20} + 2 \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$. They followed all instructions, including the format.

**C) \( \frac{99}{40} \)**
The student made two errors. First, they converted to improper fractions ($\frac{27}{10}$ and $\frac{9}{4}$). Then, they likely added the numerators and multiplied the denominators (a common misconception), or simply chose 40 as a denominator and failed to adjust the numerators correctly before adding.

**D) \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \)**
This represents the most common lower-level misconception in fraction addition: adding the "top numbers" and adding the "bottom numbers" independently. 
$2 + 2 = 4$
$7 + 1 = 8$
$10 + 4 = 14$

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum context:
*   **Below Basic:** Students working significantly below age-related expectations (KS2 SATs Scaled Score <90).
*   **Basic:** Students at age-related expectations but struggling with multi-step procedures (Foundation GCSE tier).
*   **Proficient:** Students comfortably working at age-related expectations (Higher GCSE tier grade 4-5).
*   **Advanced:** Students working at Greater Depth (Targeting GCSE grades 7-9).

| Ability Level | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 15% | 20% | **55%** |
| **Basic** | 25% | **40%** | 10% | 25% |
| **Proficient** | 20% | **75%** | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | **94%** | 1% | 0% |

#### Teacher’s Commentary:
The **Below Basic** group overwhelmingly defaults to Option D because "adding across" is the intuitive (though incorrect) path for those who haven't mastered the concept of equivalent fractions.

In the **Basic** and **Proficient** groups, the biggest "distractor" is Option A. These students often understand the arithmetic perfectly but use the "improper fraction" method to add. Because they have worked hard to reach $\frac{99}{20}$, they experience "cognitive exhaustion" and tick the first mathematically equivalent value they see, ignoring the "Leave your answer as a mixed number" instruction. 

**Advanced** students rarely fall for D or C, but occasionally lose a mark on A due to rushing (execution error rather than conceptual error).
