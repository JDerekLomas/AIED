As a UK maths teacher, I see this specific question as a classic "distractor" problem. It tests not just the algorithm for finding the mean, but the understanding of the identity of zero and the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

**A) Correct Reasoning:** To find the mean, you sum all the data points and divide by the count ($n$). While $0$ does not change the numerator's value, it is a valid data point. Thus, the sum is $(0+1+3+4+7)$ and it must be divided by $5$. Writing the numerator as $1+3+4+7$ is mathematically equivalent to $0+1+3+4+7$.

**B) Hierarchy of Operations Error:** This is a classic "calculator" error. A student understands the steps (add then divide) but fails to use brackets or a fraction bar. According to BIDMAS, this calculation would be $0+1+3+4+(7 \div 5)$, resulting in $9.4$ instead of $3$.

**C) Conceptual Error (The "Zero doesn't count" fallacy):** The student recognizes they need to divide by the number of items but believes that $0$ is "nothing" and should not be counted as a data point. Therefore, they sum the non-zero digits and divide by $4$.

**D) Verification Failure:** The student may be looking for a version of the formula that explicitly includes the $0$ in the numerator (e.g., $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$) and, upon not seeing it exactly as imagined, assumes all options are wrong.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

I have categorized "ability levels" based on typical UK secondary school progress (KS3/GCSE).

**below_basic**
*(Students struggling with the basic algorithm and order of operations)*
**A=15% B=45% C=35% D=5%**
*Reasoning:* These students often select B because it looks like the horizontal string they would type into a basic calculator. Many will choose C because they have a shaky grasp on what a "data point" is when it has no value.

**basic**
*(Students who know the "Sum / Count" rule but are prone to BIDMAS or zero-value errors)*
**A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%**
*Reasoning:* Success increases as they recognize A is technically correct, but the "Zero doesn't count" misconception (C) remains a very strong distractor at this level.

**proficient**
*(Students with a solid grasp of GCSE Foundation/Higher crossover topics)*
**A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%**
*Reasoning:* Most will recognise that the denominator must be 5. The primary error here is C, usually from rushing rather than a lack of knowledge.

**advanced**
*(Students aiming for Grades 7-9)*
**A=94% B=1% C=2% D=3%**
*Reasoning:* Nearly all will identify A. The few errors come from "over-thinking" (choosing D because they feel $0$ *should* be explicitly written in the numerator) or simple momentary lapses in concentration.
