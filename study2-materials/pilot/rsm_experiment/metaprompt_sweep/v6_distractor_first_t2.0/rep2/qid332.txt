As a UK maths teacher, I see this specific problem frequently when teaching Year 8 or Year 9 students. It tests "Order of Operations" in reverse (SAMDOB/BIDMAS) and the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) Only Tom:** This student correctly identifies that the first step should be to "undo" the subtraction of 5 by adding 5 to both sides ($\frac{x}{3} = 12 + 5 = 17$). They likely recognize that the division by 3 only applies to $x$, not the 5, so they reject Katie's method of multiplying by 3 first without distributing it.
*   **B) Only Katie:** This student likely knows they want to "get rid of the fraction" but forgets that they must multiply *every* term on the left-hand side by 3. They correctly multiply $\frac{x}{3}$ and $12$ by 3, but fail to multiply the $-5$, resulting in $x - 5 = 36$. This is a classic "procedural" error.
*   **C) Both Tom and Katie:** This student is correct. While Tom’s step is the more common first step, Katie's step is also mathematically valid if done correctly ($x - 15 = 36$). However, a student choosing (C) often believes that Katie has simply correctly "cleared the denominator," failing to notice that the $-5$ was not multiplied by 3. This is the most common "distractor" for middle-attaining students.
*   **D) Neither is correct:** This student may have miscalculated 12 + 5 as something other than 17, or they may have a fundamental misunderstanding of algebraic balance, believing both proposed steps are illegal.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, **below_basic** students often struggle with the "balance" method entirely. **Basic** students often choose C because Katie's work "looks" algebraic. **Proficient** students usually spot the error in Katie's lack of distribution, and **Advanced** students are highly unlikely to miss the omission of multiplying the constant.

**below_basic (e.g., lower KS3/Foundation Tier GCSE):**
A=25% B=20% C=40% D=15%
*(High rates of guessing; high attraction to Katie's work because it removes the "scary" fraction.)*

**basic (e.g., Year 9 Mid-set / Foundation GCSE):**
A=40% B=15% C=40% D=5%
*(Significant numbers of students fall into the trap of Option C, assuming both must be correct if they "look" like standard algebraic moves.)*

**proficient (e.g., Year 9 High-set / Higher Tier GCSE):**
A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
*(The majority will see Tom is correct. A small subset will still be "fooled" by the visual simplicity of Katie's mistake.)*

**advanced (e.g., Top Set Year 11 / A-Level prep):**
A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%
*(Almost all students at this level intuitively realize that to multiply by 3, one must multiply "every term.")*
