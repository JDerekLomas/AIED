As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific problem frequently in GCSE Foundation and Higher tiers. It tests the ability to find a common denominator involving algebraic terms.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) Correct Reasoning:** To add $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, the student finds the Lowest Common Denominator (LCD), which is $2x$. They multiply the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$ to get $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}$. Adding the numerators ($3+8$) gives $\mathbf{\frac{11}{2x}}$.
*   **B) Adding Numerators and Denominators:** This is a classic "naive" error. The student adds the numerators ($3+4=7$) and adds the denominators ($2x+x=3x$), resulting in $\mathbf{\frac{7}{3x}}$. This treats algebraic fractions like whole numbers or reveals a lack of understanding of common denominators.
*   **C) Incorrect Equivalent Fraction:** The student recognizes they need a common denominator of $x$ or $2x$. However, they incorrectly manipulate the first fraction or simply add $3+8$ but forget the "2" in the denominator, or they mistakenly think $2x + x$ somehow simplifies to just $x$ after "cancelling." More commonly, they double the 4 to get 8, add it to 3 to get 11, but lose the 2 from the denominator.
*   **D) Adding Numerators Only:** The student recognizes $2x$ as the common denominator but fails to adjust the numerator of the second fraction. They simply calculate $3+4=7$ and place it over $2x$, leading to $\mathbf{\frac{7}{2x}}$.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, **below_basic** refers to students struggling with Grade 1-2, **basic** to Grades 3-4, **proficient** to Grades 5-6, and **advanced** to Grades 7+.

**below_basic:**
Most students here do not understand the rules for fractions. Option B is the most "logical" guess for someone who treats algebraic terms like simple objects to be totaled.
*   A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%

**basic:**
Students at this level know they need a common denominator but often forget to multiply the numerator when changing the denominator (leading to D).
*   A=35% B=20% C=10% D=35%

**proficient:**
These students generally understand the mechanism of equivalent fractions. Errors are usually due to "examination slip" moments rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.
*   A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%

**advanced:**
Students at this level should find this routine. Any errors are typically caused by extreme haste or misreading the question.
*   A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
