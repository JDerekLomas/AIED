As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of BIDMAS (or BODMAS) question frequently. It tests two distinct skills: the hierarchy of operations and the ability to work with directed numbers (integers).

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

**A) $6$ (Correct Reasoning)**
The student correctly follows BIDMAS/BODMAS. They perform the multiplication first ($4 \times 2 = 8$), then process addition and subtraction from left to right: $3 - 5 = -2$, and $-2 + 8 = 6$. This requires a firm grasp of negative number arithmetic.

**B) $4$ (Misinterpreting "Addition before Subtraction")**
This is a very common "procedural" error. Students are taught **A** comes before **S** in BIDMAS, so they perform the addition first: $5 + 8 = 13$, then $3 - 13 = -10$ (which leads to D), or more commonly, they calculate $3 - 5 = -2$, but then mistakenly do $5 + 8$ or think they must add before subtracting. However, $4$ usually comes from $3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow (3-5) + 8 = 6$, but failing the integer calculation (e.g., $3-5=2$, then $2+2=4$ or similar processing errors). In reality, B is often a "distractor" for those who struggle with the negative transition between -2 and 8.

**C) $-12$ (Left-to-Right Processing)**
The student ignores the order of operations entirely and works strictly from left to right: $3 - 5 = -2$. Then $-2 + 4 = 2$. Finally $2 \times 2 = 4$ (leading to B) or, more likely, $(3-5+4) = 2$, then multiplying. $-12$ specifically comes from a mistake where the student calculates $3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 \rightarrow 3 - 9 \times 2 \rightarrow 3 - 18 = -15$, or various combinations of bracket misplacements.

**D) $-10$ (Strict BIDMAS Hierarchy Error)**
This is the most common error among "Basic/Proficient" students. They know they must multiply first: $4 \times 2 = 8$. They then see **A** (Addition) comes before **S** (Subtraction), so they perform $5 + 8 = 13$ first. They are then left with $3 - 13 = -10$. This shows an understanding that multiplication comes first, but a failure to understand that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK curriculum (KS3/GCSE), the transition from "Basic" to "Proficient" is marked by moving away from strict left-to-right processing, while the move from "Proficient" to "Advanced" is marked by mastering the equal priority of Addition/Subtraction and fluency with negative numbers.

| Level | A (Correct) | B (Logic Error) | C (Left-to-Right) | D (Strict Order) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 20% | 50% | 15% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 15% | 20% | 40% |
| **Proficient** | 60% | 5% | 5% | 30% |
| **Advanced** | 95% | 1% | 1% | 3% |

**Key Trends:**
*   **Below Basic:** Mostly work left-to-right or guess (high C and B).
*   **Basic:** Have heard of BIDMAS but apply it too literally, leading them to do the addition $(5+8)$ before the subtraction (High D).
*   **Proficient:** Understand the rules well, but a significant portion still falls into the "Addition before Subtraction" trap (D).
*   **Advanced:** Rarely make hierarchy errors, though 3-5% might make a "slip of the pen" calculation error.
