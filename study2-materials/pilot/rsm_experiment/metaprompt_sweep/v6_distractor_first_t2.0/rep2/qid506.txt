As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in Foundation Tier GCSE papers. It tests a student’s ability to perform an inverse operation on a fraction, which often triggers "intuitive" but mathematically incorrect shortcuts.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

*   **A) $p = \frac{1}{4}$**
    The student sees the numbers 3 and 12 and instinctively divides 12 by 3 to get 4, keeping it as a denominator. They are ignoring the algebraic rule of "divide both sides by 3" and are instead looking for a "common factor" relationship between the two visible integers.
*   **B) $p = \frac{1}{36}$**
    **Correct reasoning.** To solve for $p$, one must divide both sides by 3. Dividing a fraction by a whole number is equivalent to multiplying the denominator by that number: $\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12 \times 3} = \frac{1}{36}$.
*   **C) $p = 4$**
    The student performs "reverse" operations incorrectly. They might multiply 12 by 3 and get confused, but more commonly, they divide 12 by 3 and ignore the fractional nature of the RHS entirely, or they move the 3 across and think $p = 12/3$.
*   **D) $p = \frac{1}{9}$**
    The student miscalculates or misreads. They may be thinking of "subtracting 3" from the denominator ($12 - 3 = 9$) or they are making a basic multiplication error while attempting the correct process.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK system, **below_basic** equates to students targeting Grade 1-2, **basic** to Grade 3-4, **proficient** to Grade 5-6, and **advanced** to Grade 7+.

*   **Below_basic:** These students struggle with the concept of a reciprocal. Many will see "3 and 12" and choose "4" because it is a familiar number bond.
*   **Basic:** Many students here will reach for Option A. They know the answer should be a fraction, but they lack the procedural fluency to multiply the denominator.
*   **Proficient:** Students here understand they need to divide by 3, but a significant portion will still make a "reflex" error and pick A before checking their work.
*   **Advanced:** Most should get this right, though "silly errors" usually land on A due to the visual suggestibility of the numbers 3 and 12.

| Ability Level | A | B (Correct) | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below_basic** | 35% | 10% | 45% | 10% |
| **Basic** | 50% | 25% | 15% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 25% | 65% | 5% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | 93% | 1% | 1% |
