As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of substitution question frequently in GCSE Foundation and Higher tiers. It tests two distinct skills: the priority of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the rules of directed numbers (negative integers).

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) 81 (Correct):** The student correctly identifies that $k^4$ means $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$. They understand that an even number of negative signs results in a positive product ($3^4 = 81$ and negative $\times$ negative = positive).
*   **B) 12 (Incorrect):** This is a classic "operation confusion" error. The student multiplies the base ($3$) by the index ($4$) rather than performing exponentiation. They also likely ignored the negative sign or assumed it disappeared.
*   **C) -81 (Incorrect):** The student understands that $3^4 = 81$ but has a misconception regarding negative bases. They either believe "a negative number raised to any power stays negative," or they have performed $-3^4$ (without brackets) on a scientific calculator, which evaluates as $-(3^4)$.
*   **D) -12 (Incorrect):** This is a combination of two errors. The student multiplies the base by the exponent ($3 \times 4$) and maintains the negative sign from the input value without squaring it out.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions:

I have categorised these based on typical UK secondary school performance levels (Year 9–11).

*   **Below Basic (Grade 1-2):**
    These students struggle with indices and often revert to simple multiplication ($3 \times 4$).
    **A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%**

*   **Basic (Grade 3-4):**
    Students at this level know $3^4$ is not 12, but they are highly susceptible to the "negative base" trap or making calculator entry errors.
    **A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%**

*   **Proficient (Grade 5-7):**
    These students have a solid grasp of indices. The main source of error here is the misconception that a negative squared/quadrupled remains negative.
    **A=70% B=5% C=22% D=3%**

*   **Advanced (Grade 8-9):**
    High-achieving students are wary of negative bases and are trained to use brackets when substituting into $k^4$.
    **A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%**
