As a UK maths teacher, I frequently see students struggle when the unknown variable is in the denominator. Here is my analysis of the common misconceptions associated with this algebraic manipulation.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

**A) \( p=0.5 \)**
**Reasoning:** Correct algebraic manipulation. The student likely multiplies both sides by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, then divides both sides by 10 to get $p = 5/10$, which simplifies to $0.5$. This shows a firm grasp of inverse operations.

**B) \( p=50 \)**
**Reasoning:** Multiplication error/misunderstanding of the relationship. The student sees the numbers 10 and 5 and assumes they must multiply them because they see a division bar (inverting the operation on the wrong numbers). Alternatively, they may attempt to clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by 5 instead of $p$.

**C) \( p=2 \)**
**Reasoning:** Commutative property error. The student identifies that 10 and 5 are related by a factor of 2. However, they solve $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$. This is the most common error, as students often subconsciously believe the "bigger number must be divided by the smaller number" or misinterpret $\frac{5}{p}$ as $\frac{p}{5}$.

**D) There are no solutions**
**Reasoning:** Conceptual confusion regarding fractions. Some students at lower ability levels believe that if a smaller number is divided by something to result in a larger number, it is "impossible," not yet understanding that dividing by a decimal/fraction between 0 and 1 increases the quotient.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, "Below Basic" corresponds to students working well below age-related expectations (KS3 level 3-4), while "Advanced" refers to those targeting Grade 8/9 at GCSE.

**below_basic:** A=10% B=30% C=50% D=10%
*Reasoning:* These students often guess based on number bonds they recognize. $10 \div 5 = 2$ is an irresistible "easy" calculation, even if the algebra doesn't support it.

**basic:** A=25% B=15% C=55% D=5%
*Reasoning:* These students understand they need to do a calculation, but the "2" is a massive distractor. They often rearrange the formula mentally and incorrectly as $p = 10 \div 5$.

**proficient:** A=65% B=5% C=30% D=0%
*Reasoning:* These students are familiar with "changing the subject" of a formula. Most will perform the steps correctly ($10p=5$), but a significant minority will still rush and fall into the $10/5=2$ trap under exam pressure.

**advanced:** A=95% B=1% C=4% D=0%
*Reasoning:* High-ability students recognise this as a reciprocal relationship or a two-step linear equation. Errors here are almost exclusively due to extreme "exam autopilot" rather than a lack of understanding.
