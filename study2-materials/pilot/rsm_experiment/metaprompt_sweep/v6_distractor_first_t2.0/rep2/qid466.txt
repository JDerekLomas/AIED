As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently when testing a student's understanding of **multiplicative inverses** and **integer signs**.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) $\frac{4}{3}$**: This is the correct reasoning. The student understands that a number multiplied by its reciprocal results in 1, and that a negative multiplied by a positive equals a negative. They have correctly identified that $(-\frac{3}{4}) \times (\frac{4}{3}) = -\frac{12}{12} = -1$.
*   **B) $-\frac{4}{3}$**: This is the most common high-level error. The student remembers the rule for the "reciprocal" to get back to 1, but they are over-applying the rule for double negatives. They think that because the starting fraction and the answer are both negative, the multiplier must also be negative, failing to realise that $(-) \times (-) = (+)$.
*   **C) $\frac{3}{4}$**: This student likely has a weak grasp of fractions. They might be confusing the rule for adding/subtracting (where the identity is 0) or simply choosing a "positive version" of the same number because the target is -1 and they don't understand reciprocals.
*   **D) $-\frac{3}{4}$**: This student is confusing the property of identity (multiplication by 1) with the property of the reciprocal. They see the negative sign and think "if I keep it the same, it stays negative," essentially treating the multiplication as if they were trying to reach $+\frac{9}{16}$ or simply guessing.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, these ability levels correspond roughly to KS3/GCSE Foundation (Below Basic/Basic) and GCSE Higher (Proficient/Advanced).

*   **Below Basic (Target Grade 1-2):**
    Students here often struggle with fractions and negative signs simultaneously. They are likely to pick D because it "looks like" the number already there.
    **A=15% B=20% C=25% D=40%**

*   **Basic (Target Grade 3-4):**
    These students recognise that something must change to get to -1, but often default to B because they see two negatives in the question (the $-\frac{3}{4}$ and the $-1$) and assume the middle number must also be negative.
    **A=30% B=45% C=15% D=10%**

*   **Proficient (Target Grade 5-6):**
    The majority will recognise the reciprocal $\frac{4}{3}$. However, a significant minority will still make the "sign error" (Option B) by not checking their calculation once they've flipped the fraction.
    **A=65% B=25% C=5% D=5%**

*   **Advanced (Target Grade 7-9):**
    These students should navigate this easily. Any errors here are usually down to rushing (Option B) rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.
    **A=92% B=6% C=1% D=1%**
