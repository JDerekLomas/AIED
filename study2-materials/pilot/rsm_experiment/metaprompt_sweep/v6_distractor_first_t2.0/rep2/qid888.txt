As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen hundreds of students tackle the "FOIL" method or grid method for expanding double brackets. This specific question tests the ability to manipulate directed numbers (negatives), which is where most errors occur in GCSE Foundation and Higher tiers.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) $m^{2}-2 m-35$**
    The student has incorrectly calculated the sum of $-5$ and $-7$ as $-2$ (calculating $5 - 7$ or $-5 + 3$) instead of $-12$. They have also multiplied $-5 \times -7$ to get $-35$, making the common mistake that a "negative times a negative is a negative" or simply neglecting the sign change.
*   **B) $m^{2}-12 m+35$**
    **Correct Reasoning.** The student correctly applied the FOIL/grid method: $m \times m = m^2$; the middle terms $-7m$ and $-5m$ sum to $-12m$; and the constant term $-5 \times -7 = +35$.
*   **C) $m^{2}+12 m+35$**
    The student understands that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive ($+35$), but they have failed to track the signs for the addition of the middle terms, treating $-5m$ and $-7m$ as positive $12m$. This often happens when students mentally ignore signs until the final step.
*   **D) $m^{2}-12 m-35$**
    The student correctly calculated the middle term ($-12m$) but failed the negative multiplication rule for the constant. They likely thought "5 times 7 is 35, and there's a minus sign in the bracket, so it's -35." This is the most common "near-miss" error for average-ability students.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK context:
*   **Below Basic:** Students working at Grade 1–2. Likely to guess or make multiple sign errors.
*   **Basic:** Students working at Grade 3–4. Understand the structure of expansion but struggle with negative integers.
*   **Proficient:** Students working at Grade 5–6. Generally reliable with negatives but occasionally make "silly" mistakes under pressure.
*   **Advanced:** Students working at Grade 7+. High accuracy expected.

**below_basic:** A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%
*(Confusion reigns; C is attractive because "plus" feels more natural than "double minus".)*

**basic:** A=15% B=35% C=15% D=35%
*(High incidence of D as they remember to add the middle numbers but forget the product rule for signs.)*

**proficient:** A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
*(Most have mastered the rule, but the $-5 \times -7 = -35$ error still persists as a lapse in concentration.)*

**advanced:** A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
*(Highly likely to get it right; errors are almost exclusively due to reading the question too fast.)*
