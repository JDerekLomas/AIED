As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently when introducing linear equations and coordinate geometry. The core difficulty here lies in the "implicit" form of the equation ($4x + 2y = 10$) compared to the more familiar $y = mx + c$ form.

### Step 1 — Reasoning behind each option

**A) Reasoning:** The student ignores the variables entirely and performs a calculation using the constants shown in the equation and table ($10 \times 2$ or $4 \times 5$). Alternatively, they confuse the coefficient of $y$ (2) and the target (10) and multiply them because they don't understand the balance of the equation.

**B) Reasoning:** This is a common "shallow processing" error. The student substitutes $x=1$ instead of $x=0$. If $x=1$, then $4(1) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 6 \rightarrow y = 3$. Students often skip the first column of a table if it contains a zero, thinking the "first" value should correspond to the "first" non-zero $x$.

**C) Reasoning [Correct]:** The student substitutes $x=0$ into the equation. $4(0) + 2y = 10$ simplifies to $2y = 10$. Dividing by 2 gives $y = 5$. This shows a solid understanding of substitution and solving a one-step linear equation.

**D) Reasoning:** The student assumes that to find $y$, they must divide the "result" (10) by the "first coefficient" (4). This is a procedural misconception where students simply perform $10 \div 4 = 2.5$, ignoring the structure of the equation entirely.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

I have categorized these levels based on the UK GCSE scale (Below Basic: Grade 1-2, Basic: Grade 3-4, Proficient: Grade 5-6, Advanced: Grade 7-9).

**below_basic:** A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
*Students at this level often guess based on simple arithmetic operations between the numbers they see ($10 \div 4$ or $10 \times 2$). There is very little conceptual understanding of the equals sign as a balance.*

**basic:** A=15% B=30% C=40% D=15%
*Students here are starting to substitute but are prone to "off-by-one" errors (choosing B) or may still be confused by the coefficient of $x$. However, many will recognise that if $x$ is 0, they just need to deal with the $2y=10$ part.*

**proficient:** A=5% B=15% C=75% D=5%
*Most students at this level have mastered substitution. Those who get it wrong are likely making the B-error by working out the value for $x=1$ through a lapse in concentration/skipping the zero.*

**advanced:** A=0% B=5% C=95% D=0%
*High-ability students will find this trivial. The only errors recorded here would be "silly mistakes" where a student accidentally calculates the next value in the table instead of the requested one.*
