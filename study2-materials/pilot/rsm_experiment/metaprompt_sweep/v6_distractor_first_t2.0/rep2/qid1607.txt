As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen this specific "reverse operation" error many times when teaching linear equations to Key Stage 3 and GCSE students.

### Step 1 — Analysis of Reasoning

*   **A) Only Step 1:** This is the **correct mathematical analysis**. The student correctly identifies that Step 1 is valid (multiplying both sides by 4 to get $60 = 1 + k$), but recognizes that Step 2 is incorrect because Isaac added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting it (the inverse of $+1$ is $-1$).
*   **B) Only Step 2:** This is a rare choice. It would stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of the whole problem. A student might think Step 1 is "illegal" because they expect to see the $+1$ moved before the denominator is cleared, but somehow believe $61 = k$ is a "reasonable" looking answer.
*   **C) Both steps are correct:** This is a **common error** caused by "Operation Automatism." The student sees $60$ and $1$ and intuitively adds them because they are thinking about "combining" numbers rather than performing inverse operations. They validate both steps because $60+1$ does indeed equal $61$, ignoring the algebraic balance.
*   **D) Both steps are incorrect:** This is usually chosen by students who believe you must always subtract/add before you multiply/divide when rearranging. They think Step 1 is wrong because they think Isaac should have dealt with the $+1$ first (not realizing the vinculum acts as a grouping symbol).

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK school system, these categories align roughly with GCSE grades 1-2 (Below Basic), 3-4 (Basic), 5-6 (Proficient), and 7-9 (Advanced).

*   **below_basic:** A=15% B=10% C=45% D=30%
    *   *Reasoning:* These students struggle with the order of operations in algebra. Many will pick C because "60 + 1 = 61" looks right, or D because they have a vague memory that the fraction bar changes things and assume it's all wrong.
*   **basic:** A=35% B=5% C=40% D=20%
    *   *Reasoning:* Many students at this level still fall into the "C trap." They are so relieved to see a correct multiplication in Step 1 that they follow the arithmetic logic of Step 2 without checking the inverse sign.
*   **proficient:** A=75% B=2% C=15% D=8%
    *   *Reasoning:* These students are generally reliable with two-step equations. Most will spot the sign error in Step 2. A small portion will still "autopilot" through option C.
*   **advanced:** A=96% B=0% C=2% D=2%
    *   *Reasoning:* High-achieving students will immediately identify the "$-1$" error. Any errors here are likely due to misreading the question (e.g., misreading $k$ for another symbol).
