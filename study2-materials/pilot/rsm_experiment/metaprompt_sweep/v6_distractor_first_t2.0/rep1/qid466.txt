As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently when testing students on **multiplicative inverses** and **integer operations**. The "star" effectively serves as a precursor to algebraic notation ($x$).

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) $\frac{4}{3}$:** This is the **correct answer**. The student understands that a number multiplied by its reciprocal equals 1. They also correctly apply the rule that a "negative times a positive equals a negative" to maintain the negative sign on the right-hand side.
*   **B) $-\frac{4}{3}$:** The student knows the concept of a reciprocal but has misapplied the rules for signs. They likely think "I need a negative answer, so I need a negative in the middle," forgetting that two negatives make a positive ($-\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{4}{3} = +1$).
*   **C) $\frac{3}{4}$:** This is a common "surface-level" error. The student sees $-3/4$ and $-1$ and assumes they need to add something or simply picks a similar-looking positive fraction without calculating the multiplication. They may be confusing the rule for adding a value to get zero.
*   **D) $-\frac{3}{4}$:** The student may be guessing or confusing this with the identity property of 1 (e.g., $x \times 1 = x$), thinking that if they multiply the fraction by itself, it somehow results in the "whole" integer.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, these ability levels correspond roughly to:
*   **Below Basic:** Working below GCSE Grade 3 (struggling with fractions and signs).
*   **Basic:** Working at GCSE Grade 3/4 (understands basics but inconsistent with signs).
*   **Proficient:** Working at GCSE Grade 5/6 (solid understanding of reciprocals).
*   **Advanced:** Working at GCSE Grade 7+ (confident with all fraction and algebraic rules).

**Predicted Percentages:**

**below_basic:** A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%
*Reasoning:* Students at this level often guess based on visual similarity. Options B, C, and D look "right" because they contain the same numbers or the same signs. B is a common trap for those who know the word "reciprocal" but not the mechanics.

**basic:** A=35% B=45% C=10% D=10%
*Reasoning:* Most students will recognize that the fraction must flip (the reciprocal). However, the "double negative" rule is the number one source of error here; they will choose B because they see a negative result and assume they need a negative multiplier.

**proficient:** A=75% B=20% C=3% D=2%
*Reasoning:* Proficient students generally grasp that $(- \times + = -)$. Those who get it wrong usually do so because of a momentary lapse in concentration regarding the sign rather than a misunderstanding of the fraction itself.

**advanced:** A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
*Reasoning:* This is a foundational skill for high-achievers. Errors here are almost exclusively "slip-of-the-pen" mistakes or misreading the question.
