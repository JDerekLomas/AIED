As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this type of substitution and algebraic manipulation problem frequently at GCSE level (typically Foundation tier). The question tests a student's ability to substitute $x=0$ into a linear equation and solve for $y$.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning for each option:

*   **A) 20:** The student performs a common "mis-operation." They see the 4 and the 2 next to each other (or add $10+10$) and incorrectly multiply the coefficient of $y$ by the constant on the right-hand side ($2 \times 10 = 20$), or they simply perform $4 \times 5$ (perhaps misinterpreting the $y$ as $x$ from a different context).
*   **B) 3:** This is usually a calculation error following a sign mistake or a guess based on the sequence of the table. A student might try to solve $4+2y=10$, getting $2y=6$, so $y=3$. This means they substituted $x=1$ instead of $x=0$.
*   **C) 5:** **Correct Reasoning.** Substitute $x = 0$ into $4x + 2y = 10$. This results in $4(0) + 2y = 10$, which simplifies to $2y = 10$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $y = 5$.
*   **D) 2.5:** This represents a "division error." The student correctly identifies that they need to divide 10 by something, but they divide by 4 (the coefficient of $x$) instead of 2 (the coefficient of $y$), or they assume $y$ is half of $x$'s usual impact.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

The "ability levels" here correspond to UK progress tracks (e.g., Working Towards Grade 3, Grade 4-5, Grade 6-7, Grade 8+).

**below_basic:** A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%
*(Students at this level often struggle with the concept of $4x$ when $x=0$, frequently guessing or picking numbers they see in the equation.)*

**basic:** A=10% B=15% C=55% D=20%
*(These students understand substitution but often make errors in which coefficient to divide by or accidentally use the wrong column in the table, like $x=1$.)*

**proficient:** A=2% B=5% C=88% D=5%
*(Most students at this level correctly handle the $0$ term, as it is a standard "find the intercept" procedure. Errors are usually down to rushing.)*

**advanced:** A=0% B=1% C=98% D=1%
*(Almost all advanced students will solve this mentally and correctly in a matter of seconds. Only a "silly" reading error would lead to B or D.)*
