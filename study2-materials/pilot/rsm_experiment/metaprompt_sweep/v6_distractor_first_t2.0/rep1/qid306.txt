As a UK maths teacher, I encounter the misconceptions behind these problems frequently when teaching "BIDMAS" (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction).

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) [reasoning]**
    The student follows the "Left-to-Right" rule for both calculations, ignoring the hierarchy of operations in Problem Q. They likely view math as reading a sentence from left to right regardless of the operators involved.
*   **B) [reasoning]**
    **This is the mathematically correct reasoning.** In Problem P, Addition and Subtraction have equal priority, so we work left-to-right ($4-5$ first). In Problem Q, Multiplication has higher priority than Addition (BIDMAS/BODMAS), so $5 \times 6$ is performed first.
*   **C) [reasoning]**
    The student is a victim of a rigid, literal interpretation of the BIDMAS acronym. Because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the word BIDMAS, they incorrectly believe they must always do $5+6$ first in Problem P. Simultaneously, they ignore operator hierarchy in Problem Q, choosing left-to-right.
*   **D) [reasoning]**
    The student applies a strict, literal interpretation of BIDMAS for both. They correctly identify that Multiplication precedes Addition in Q, but incorrectly believe Addition must precede Subtraction in P because 'A' appears before 'S' in the acronym. This is a very common "mid-level" misconception.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, "Below Basic" refers to students struggling with Year 6 (KS2) foundations; "Proficient" refers to a solid Grade 5/6 GCSE student; "Advanced" refers to Grade 8/9 students.

**below_basic:** A=55% B=15% C=15% D=15%
*Reasoning:* These students almost exclusively work left-to-right. They haven't memorised the BIDMAS order yet, making Option A the overwhelming favorite.

**basic:** A=25% B=20% C=10% D=45%
*Reasoning:* These students have learned the acronym but take it literally. The "Addition before Subtraction" trap (Option D) is most prevalent here. They know $\times$ comes before $+$, but they haven't learned that $+$ and $-$ have equal priority.

**proficient:** A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
*Reasoning:* Most students at this level understand that $\times$ outweighs $+$. However, a significant portion still falls for the D trap (doing $5+6$ first in P) because the "equal priority" rule for Addition/Subtraction is often the last part of BIDMAS to be mastered.

**advanced:** A=2% B=92% C=1% D=5%
*Reasoning:* Advanced students recognise that Addition and Subtraction are inverse operations with equal priority, necessitating a left-to-right approach for Problem P, and they naturally apply the priority of multiplication in Problem Q.
