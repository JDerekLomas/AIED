As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen this specific type of multi-step equation trip up students frequently, primarily due to confusion over the "order of operations in reverse" and the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

**A) Only Tom:** This student correctly identifies that adding 5 to both sides is a valid first step. They understand that since 5 is being subtracted from the whole fraction term, adding it is the most direct inverse. They likely believe Katie is wrong because they think you *must* add/subtract before you multiply, or they recognise that Katie failed to multiply the $-5$ by $3$.

**B) Only Katie:** This student likely struggles with the structure of fractions. They see the $\div 3$ and want to "undo" it first. However, they possess the common misconception that you only multiply the terms you *want* to clear, forgetting that the 5 is a separate term that must also be scaled to maintain equality.

**C) Both Tom and Katie:** This student identifies that Tom is correct. However, they have a "fragmented" understanding of algebra. They see that $12 \times 3 = 36$ and $x/3 \times 3 = x$ in Katie's working and assume that because some valid operations were performed, the whole line must be correct. They miss the distributive error ($5 \times 3$).

**D) Neither is correct:** This student may have miscalculated Tom's addition ($12+5$) or has a fundamental misunderstanding of inverse operations, perhaps believing that the first step must involve the $x$ term directly in a way not presented here.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK curriculum (KS3/GCSE), the "Only Tom" vs "Both" trap is the most significant discriminator for this topic.

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level often guess or see the number 36 (from $12 \times 3$) and assume Katie must be right.
*   **Basic:** These students usually recognize Tom’s step as "the way they were taught" but are easily swayed into thinking Katie’s alternative approach is also valid because the numbers seem to "fit."
*   **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of inverse operations and are the most likely to spot Katie's error in failing to multiply the $-5$.
*   **Advanced:** These students quickly verify both steps. They might momentarily think Katie could be right if she meant $(x-15)=36$, but they will definitively land on A after checking the distribution.

| Ability Level | A (Tom) | B (Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 25% | 30% | 35% | 10% |
| **Basic** | 40% | 15% | 40% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 75% | 5% | 18% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 96% | 1% | 2% | 1% |

**Teacher's Note:** The "distractor" C is the most dangerous for the mid-ability range. Students often think there are multiple "shortcuts" in algebra and will assume Katie is just using a shortcut they don't fully understand yet.
