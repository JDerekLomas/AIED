As a UK maths teacher, I see this question as a classic test of two distinct areas: the conceptual understanding of "zero" as a value in data sets, and the technical understanding of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS).

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

**A) Correct Reasoning:** This represents the sum $(0+1+3+4+7)$ divided by the number of data points (5). The student understands that even though 0 doesn't change the sum, it is still a data point that must be included in the divisor. Omitting "0+" from the numerator is mathematically valid.

**B) Incorrect Reasoning (Order of Operations):** This is a common calculator/writing error. Without brackets, BIDMAS rules dictate that only the 7 is divided by 5 ($0+1+3+4+1.4$). Students who choose this often know "sum then divide" but lack the notation skills to express it correctly as a fraction or bracketed expression.

**C) Misconception of Zero:** This is a common conceptual error where the student ignores the zero entirely. They believe that because the zero has no value, it shouldn't "count" towards the total number of items in the set ($n=4$ instead of $n=5$).

**D) Distractor/Overthinking:** This is often chosen by students who believe that "0" must be explicitly written in the numerator (i.e., they see the absence of "$0+$" as a mistake) or those who are generally confused by the structure of the options.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

I have categorized ability levels based on GCSE target grades (Below Basic: 1-2, Basic: 3-4, Proficient: 5-6, Advanced: 7-9).

*   **below_basic:** A=15% B=45% C=30% D=10%
    *   *Rationale:* These students heavily struggle with BIDMAS (B) and have a poor conceptual grasp of zero as a value in averages (C).
*   **basic:** A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
    *   *Rationale:* Students start to recognise the structure of the mean. However, "counting the numbers" often leads them to exclude zero when calculating $n$, leading them to C.
*   **proficient:** A=75% B=10% C=10% D=5%
    *   *Rationale:* Most will identify that A is the correct sum-to-count ratio. A small portion might still slip up on BIDMAS notation or the "zero" rule.
*   **advanced:** A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
    *   *Rationale:* Mastery of BIDMAS and data concepts. Any errors here are likely due to rushing/skimming rather than lack of knowledge.
