As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen these algebraic misconceptions frequently, typically during Key Stage 3 (Years 7–9) when students are transitioning from "linear" arithmetic notation to "fractional" algebraic notation.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) Correct reasoning.** The student understands that the division symbol translates to the vinculum (fraction bar) and that the term following the division sign is the divisor. They correctly identify that the brackets group $h+4$ as a single entity to be placed in the denominator.
*   **B) Over-extension of terms.** The student likely feels that a single "4" isn't balanced or has misapplied a rule about doing the same thing to the top and bottom of a fraction. They "attach" the $+4$ to the numerator $c$ to make the expression look symmetrical.
*   **C) Misunderstanding of Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).** The student has ignored the brackets. They have processed $c \div h$ first to get $\frac{c}{h}$ and then added the $4$ as an afterthought, failing to see the bracketed term as a single denominator.
*   **D) Reverse operation/Divisor confusion.** The student knows the division sign becomes a fraction bar but is confused about which term becomes the numerator and which becomes the denominator. This is a common "first term goes on the bottom" error.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK context, "below_basic" represents students working significantly below age-related expectations (Level 3/4 equivalent), while "advanced" represents those working toward a Grade 8 or 9 at GCSE.

| Ability Level | A (%) | B (%) | C (%) | D (%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 20% | 35% | 25% |
| **Basic** | 55% | 10% | 20% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 2% | 8% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 0% | 1% | 1% |

#### Teacher’s Commentary on the Data:
*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level often treat algebra as "moving symbols around." They are most likely to pick **C** because they struggle to hold the concept of a "grouped denominator" in their head, or **D** because they haven't solidified the left-to-right rule for division in fractions.
*   **Basic:** Many students here have just learned that $a \div b = \frac{a}{b}$. They are likely to get this right (**A**), but a significant portion will still ignore the brackets (**C**) because they have a shaky grasp of how BIDMAS translates into algebraic structures.
*   **Proficient:** These students are fluent in writing algebraic expressions. The small percentage of errors will likely be due to "slips" or misreading the question quickly (visual confusion with **C** or **D**).
*   **Advanced:** It is very rare for an advanced student to get this wrong; if they do, it is almost certainly a clerical error rather than a conceptual misunderstanding.
