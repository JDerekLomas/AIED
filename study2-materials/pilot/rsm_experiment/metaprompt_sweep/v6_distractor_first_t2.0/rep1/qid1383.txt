As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently in Foundation and Higher GCSE papers. It tests two distinct concepts: index laws and the priority of operations (BIDMAS) when dealing with negative bases.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) 81 (Correct Reasoning):** The student correctly understands that $(-3)^4$ means $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$. They apply the rule that a negative number raised to an even power results in a positive value: $9 \times 9 = 81$.
*   **B) 12 (Multiplication Error):** The student has misinterpreted the index notation as multiplication between the base and the exponent ($k \times 4$). They have also likely ignored the negative sign or assumed it "disappears" in multiplication: $3 \times 4 = 12$.
*   **C) -81 (Calculation/Input Error):** This is the most common "near-miss." The student calculates $3^4 = 81$ correctly but believes the negative sign is applied *after* the power (effectively calculating $-1 \times 3^4$). This is often caused by incorrect calculator use (entering $-3^4$ instead of $(-3)^4$) or a misunderstanding of the importance of brackets.
*   **D) -12 (Misinterpretation and Signs):** Similar to Option B, the student multiplies the base by the exponent ($k \times 4$) but maintains the negative sign: $-3 \times 4 = -12$.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

I have categorised students by "ability level" in the context of typical UK GCSE grades (e.g., Working towards Grade 3, Grade 4/5, Grade 6/7, and Grade 8/9).

*   **below_basic (Working towards Grade 3):**
    These students struggle with the definition of an index and frequently default to multiplication.
    **A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%**

*   **basic (Grade 4-5 / "The C-grade student"):**
    These students understand that $k^4$ means multiplying $k$ four times, but they are highly susceptible to the calculator error/sign error that leads to -81.
    **A=40% B=15% C=35% D=10%**

*   **proficient (Grade 6-7):**
    These students are comfortable with index notation. The primary error here is the nuance of squaring/raising negative numbers to even powers.
    **A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%**

*   **advanced (Grade 8-9):**
    These students have a firm grasp of algebraic substitution and are aware of the potential "negative trap."
    **A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%**
