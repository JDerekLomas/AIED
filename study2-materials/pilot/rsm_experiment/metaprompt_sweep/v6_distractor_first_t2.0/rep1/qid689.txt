As a UK maths teacher, I frequently see this question used to test a student's understanding of "rearranging equations where the unknown is the denominator"—a notorious stumbling block in Key Stage 3 and GCSE Foundation tiers.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

**A) \( p=0.5 \)**  
**[Correct reasoning]** To solve \( 10 = \frac{5}{p} \), the student must multiply both sides by \( p \) to get \( 10p = 5 \), then divide by 10. \( p = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \) or \( 0.5 \).

**B) \( p=50 \)**  
**[Misconception: Inverse operation error]** The student sees the division by \( p \) and knows they need to multiply, but they mistakenly multiply the two numbers shown (\( 10 \times 5 \)) rather than performing the correct algebraic steps.

**C) \( p=2 \)**  
**[Misconception: Division in wrong order]** The student recognizes that 10 and 5 are related by a factor of 2. Because they are used to dividing the larger number by the smaller number to get a "nice" integer, they perform \( 10 \div 5 = 2 \), ignoring the position of the variable.

**D) There are no solutions**  
**[Confusion: Misunderstanding of fractions/variables]** A student might choose this if they believe a denominator cannot be larger than the numerator to result in a whole number, or if they are generally overwhelmed by the algebraic structure and assume it is a "trick" question.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

In the UK system, **below_basic** refers to students working significantly below age-related expectations (Level 1–2 at GCSE), while **advanced** refers to students working at Grade 7–9.

*   **below_basic:** Most students here see two numbers and guess an operation. \( 10 \times 5 \) and \( 10 \div 5 \) are the most common guesses.
    *   `A=10% B=40% C=40% D=10%`

*   **basic:** These students (GCSE Grade 3–4) know they should divide, but they usually default to "Big number \(\div\) Small number," leading them straight to C.
    *   `A=25% B=15% C=55% D=5%`

*   **proficient:** These students (GCSE Grade 5–6) are beginning to rearrange more confidently. They will likely identify that the answer is a fraction, though some will still fall into the trap of C by rushing.
    *   `A=70% B=5% C=24% D=1%`

*   **advanced:** Students at this level (GCSE Grade 7+) will recognize this as a one-step manipulation or will mentally substitute \( 0.5 \) back into the equation to verify.
    *   `A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%`
