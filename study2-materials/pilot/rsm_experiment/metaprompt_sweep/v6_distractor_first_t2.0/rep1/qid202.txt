As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently in Key Stage 3 and GCSE Foundation papers. It tests the fundamental understanding of mixed number addition versus fraction operations.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

**A) [Correct reasoning]** The student correctly adds the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and the numerators ($1 + 2 = 3$), keeping the common denominator as $5$. They followed the instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number.

**B) [Conceptual proficiency but instruction error]** The student successfully adds the fractions to get $3 \frac{3}{5}$ but then converts it into an improper fraction ($3 \times 5 + 3 = 18$). While mathematically equivalent, they ignored the "leave as a mixed number" instruction. Alternatively, they converted to $\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}$ and didn't convert back.

**C) [Misconception: Adding denominators]** This is a very common error for lower-attaining students. They have added the whole numbers ($1+2=3$), but then treated the fraction part as a simple "add across" operation ($1+2=3$ and $5+5=10$), resulting in $3 \frac{3}{10}$, but then incorrectly represented or calculated it purely as a fraction $\frac{18}{10}$, likely through a confusing mix of conversion and addition errors.

**D) [Misconception: Adding denominators]** The student adds the whole numbers correctly ($3$) and the numerators ($3$), but mistakenly adds the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$). This is the most common misconception in fraction addition for students who have not yet mastered the concept of a common denominator.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level often treat the components of a fraction as four separate integers. Option D is the classic "trap" for them.
*   **Basic:** These students understand they should add the big numbers and the top numbers, but are still prone to adding the denominators. Some may opt for B if they were recently drilled on improper fractions.
*   **Proficient:** These students know how to add fractions correctly, but some may lose a mark by failing to read the final instruction ("mixed number"), leading them to B.
*   **Advanced:** These students will read the full instruction and perform the correct calculation effortlessly.

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Improper) | C (Incorrect) | D (Add Denoms) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 15% | 20% | 45% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 15% | 5% | 35% |
| **Proficient** | 80% | 15% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 2% | 0% | 0% |
