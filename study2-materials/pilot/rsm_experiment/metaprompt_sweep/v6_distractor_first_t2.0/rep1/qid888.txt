As a UK maths teacher, I frequently see this specific quadratic expansion used to test a student's command of directed numbers (integers). The common pitfalls are almost always the sum and the product of the two constants $(-5)$ and $(-7)$.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) $m^{2}-2 m-35$**
    The student has attempted to find the difference between 7 and 5 for the linear term (treating them as $+5$ and $-7$, or similar) and has multiplied $-5 \times 7$ to get $-35$. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of how to combine the signs.
*   **B) $m^{2}-12m+35$**
    **Correct.** The student used the FOIL method or grid method correctly: $m \times m = m^2$; outside/inside terms are $-7m$ and $-5m$, which sum to $-12m$; and the product of the constants is $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$.
*   **C) $m^{2}+12 m+35$**
    The student knows the product of two negatives is a positive ($+35$), but they have failed to apply the negative signs to the addition. They have essentially calculated $(m+5)(m+7)$.
*   **D) $m^{2}-12 m-35$**
    This is the most common "near-miss" error. The student correctly calculates the linear term $(-7m - 5m = -12m)$ but makes the sign error on the final multiplication, believing that a negative times a negative is a negative, or simply forgetting to apply the rule to the constant.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, these ability levels correspond roughly to:
*   **Below Basic:** Working towards GCSE Grade 1–2.
*   **Basic:** GCSE Grade 3–4 (Foundation tier borderline).
*   **Proficient:** GCSE Grade 5–6 (Higher tier).
*   **Advanced:** GCSE Grade 7+ (A-level candidates).

**below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%**
Students at this level often treat the four numbers ($m, -5, m, -7$) almost at random. C and D are very attractive because the student might correctly sum 5 and 7 but guess the signs.

**basic: A=10% B=35% C=20% D=35%**
Many Foundation students struggle with "double negatives." Option D is a massive "distractor" here because they often remember that $(-5) + (-7) = -12$ but then think the answer must "stay negative" at the end.

**proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%**
By this stage, students are fluent with FOIL/Grid methods. Errors are usually down to rushing or a "lapse in concentration" on the final sign of the constant term (leading to D).

**advanced: A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%**
Students at this level see $(x-a)(x-b)$ as a standard pattern. An error here is purely a "slip" rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.
