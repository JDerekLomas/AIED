As an experienced UK maths teacher, I recognize this as a classic "changing the subject of a formula" problem involving a non-linear relationship. This specific question tests both the recall of the sphere volume formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) and the algebraic proficiency required to isolate $r$.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) $\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V\pi}{3}}$**: The student incorrectly "moves" terms. They likely multiplied both sides by the entire numerator of the fraction ($4\pi$) instead of dividing. It reflects a confusion about inverse operations (thinking they should multiply because they see a fraction, but applying it to the wrong terms).
*   **B) $\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}$**: The student has successfully handled the $\pi$, but has inverted the fraction $4/3$ incorrectly during the transposition. They likely multiplied by 4 and divided by 3, mirroring the appearance of the original formula rather than applying the reciprocal.
*   **C) $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$ (Correct)**: The student correctly rearranges $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. They multiply by 3 ($3V = 4\pi r^3$), divide by $4\pi$ ($\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$), and then take the cube root.
*   **D) $\frac{3\sqrt[3]{V}}{4\pi}$**: The student understands that a cube root is needed but has poor "fraction hygiene" and algebraic order. They likely attempted to move the $4$, $3$, and $\pi$ without including them under the radical, or they applied the root only to $V$ before finishing the rearrangement.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, this corresponds to Higher Tier GCSE (Grades 5-9).

**below_basic (Working at Grade 3/4)**
*Focus is often on substituting numbers; rearranging symbols is a significant struggle.*
A=30% B=25% C=15% D=30%
*Reasoning: High guessing rate. Many will pick D because the cube root looks "correct" for a volume problem but the fraction stays messy.*

**basic (Working at Grade 5/6)**
*Students know the formula but often make a single-step error in the algebra.*
A=15% B=30% C=40% D=15%
*Reasoning: Option B is the "most likely" error here, as students often struggle with the reciprocal of 4/3.*

**proficient (Working at Grade 7/8)**
*Good algebraic fluency; comfortable with multi-step transposition.*
A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
*Reasoning: Most will correctly isolate $r^3$ before applying the cube root to the entire expression.*

**advanced (Working at Grade 9 / A-Level prep)**
*Highly fluent; rarely make procedural errors in rearrangement.*
A=1% B=2% C=96% D=1%
*Reasoning: Only slip-of-the-pen errors would lead to incorrect choices here.*
