As an experienced teacher, I recognize this question as a diagnostic check for two specific skills: the "FOIL" (Firsts, Outers, Inners, Lasts) method and integer arithmetic involving signs.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

**A) $+4$**
*   **Reasoning:** Correct. The student correctly identifies the two terms as $-1$ and $-4$. They apply the multiplication rule: a negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive $(1 \times 4 = 4)$.

**B) $-4$**
*   **Reasoning:** Multiplication error with signs. The student correctly multiplies $1 \times 4$, but ignores one of the signs or incorrectly assumes that a "minus and a minus make a minus" in multiplication.

**C) $+5$**
*   **Reasoning:** Operation error (addition). The student incorrectly adds the numbers $(1 + 4 = 5)$ instead of multiplying them. They correctly interpret that two negatives in this context (subtracting a negative or "debt") should result in a positive value.

**D) $-5$**
*   **Reasoning:** Multiple errors. The student performs addition instead of multiplication $(-1 + -4 = -5)$. This is a common confusion for students who haven't fully separated the rules for "collecting like terms" (addition/subtraction) from "expanding brackets" (multiplication).

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

I have categorized the students as follows:
*   **Below Basic:** Struggling with both directed numbers and the concept of expanding brackets.
*   **Basic:** Understands that brackets involve multiplication, but struggles with negative number rules.
*   **Proficient:** Understands the process well but may make a "silly mistake" under time pressure.
*   **Advanced:** Mastery of directed numbers and algebraic manipulation.

| Ability Level | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 25% | 15% | 40% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 35% | 5% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 10% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0% | 1% |

**Analysis of the data:**
In my experience, the most common distractor for **Below Basic** students is **D**, because their mental model of "two negatives" defaults to a larger negative sum. **Basic** students often swing towards **B** because they remember that the "minus stays" if they haven't solidified the multiplication rules. **C** is the rarest choice but occurs frequently enough among students who simply see numbers and perform the easiest operation available.
