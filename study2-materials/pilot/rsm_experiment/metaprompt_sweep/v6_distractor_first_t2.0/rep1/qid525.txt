As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen this specific type of question frequently in Key Stage 3 and GCSE Foundation papers. The challenge lies in managing three distinct steps: finding a common denominator, performing the addition, and following the final instruction regarding the format of the answer.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

**A) \( \frac{99}{20} \)**
The student has performed the calculation correctly using a common denominator ($2 \frac{14}{20} + 2 \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$). However, they failed to read the final instruction: **"Leave your answer as a mixed number."** This is a classic "functional" error where the student focuses on the arithmetic but ignores the formatting constraint.

**B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \)**
**This is the correct answer.** The student successfully added the whole numbers ($2 + 2 = 4$) and converted the fractions to a common denominator of 20 ($\frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20}$).

**C) \( \frac{99}{40} \)**
This represents two common misconceptions combined. First, like option A, the student failed to provide a mixed number. Second, the denominator of 40 suggests they likely multiplied the denominators ($10 \times 4$) but perhaps made an error in the numerators or didn't simplify. It can also stem from the "add the top, add the bottom" error after a failed conversion attempt.

**D) \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \)**
This is the "naïve" addition error. The student added the whole numbers ($2 + 2 = 4$) and then simply **added the numerators and added the denominators** ($7+1$ over $10+4$). This is a very common misconception at the 'basic' level when students forget the requirement for a common denominator.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level almost always gravitate towards Option D, as they perceive addition as a horizontal operation.
*   **Basic:** Students start to remember common denominators but often make format errors (A) or fall back on the simplest visible logic (D).
*   **Proficient:** These students know the method but often rush the final step or miss the "mixed number" instruction.
*   **Advanced:** These students have a high accuracy rate and are trained to check the final format required.

| Ability Level | A (Format Error) | B (Correct) | C (Conceptual Error) | D (Naive Addition) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 15% | 20% | 55% |
| **Basic** | 20% | 35% | 15% | 30% |
| **Proficient** | 25% | 65% | 5% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | 94% | 1% | 0% |
