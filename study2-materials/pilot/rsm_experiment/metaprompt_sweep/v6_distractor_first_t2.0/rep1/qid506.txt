As a UK maths teacher, I frequently see students struggle with the conceptual transition from whole-number algebra to equations involving fractions. This specific problem tests the ability to perform the inverse operation of multiplication ($\div 3$) on a fraction.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

**A) $p = \frac{1}{4}$**
The student recognizes they need to "do something with the 3 and the 12." They misidentify the operation, seeing $3$ and $12$ and instinctively dividing 12 by 3 to get 4, but maintaining the fractional form. They have performed $1 \div (12 \div 3)$ rather than $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$.

**B) $p = \frac{1}{36}$ (Correct)**
The student correctly identifies that to isolate $p$, they must divide both sides by 3. They understand that $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$ is equivalent to $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$, resulting in $\frac{1}{36}$.

**C) $p = 4$**
The student ignores the fraction structure entirely. They treat the equation as $12 \div 3$. Often, these students are "number grabbing"—taking the two integers they see and dividing the larger by the smaller because it results in a "cleaner" whole number.

**D) $p = \frac{1}{9}$**
The student mistakenly subtracts 3 from the denominator (treating it as $12 - 3$) instead of dividing or multiplying. Alternatively, they might be attempting to "cross-multiply" in a vaguely remembered way but perform $12 - 3 = 9$.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions:

I have categorised students according to GCSE target grades: **Below Basic** (Grades 1-2), **Basic** (Grades 3-4), **Proficient** (Grades 5-6), and **Advanced** (Grades 7-9).

**below_basic:** A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
*Reasoning: Students at this level often default to whole numbers (C) or manipulate the visible integers 3 and 12 into a familiar relationship (A).*

**basic:** A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
*Reasoning: The student knows $p$ must be a small fraction, but frequently makes the mistake of dividing 12 by 3 (A) instead of multiplying 12 by 3 in the denominator.*

**proficient:** A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
*Reasoning: Most students here understand the mechanics of $\frac{a}{b} \div c$, though a few will still fall into the "instinctive division" trap of Option A.*

**advanced:** A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
*Reasoning: These students have mastered inverse operations and fraction arithmetic; errors here are almost exclusively down to rare cognitive slips (rushed reading).*
