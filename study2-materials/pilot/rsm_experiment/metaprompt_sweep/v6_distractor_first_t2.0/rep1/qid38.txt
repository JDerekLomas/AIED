As an experienced UK maths teacher, I encounter this specific algebraic fraction problem frequently, typically at Key Stage 4 (GCSE). It tests the ability to find a common denominator while dealing with algebraic terms.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) Correct reasoning.** To add fractions, a common denominator is needed. The lowest common multiple of $2x$ and $x$ is $2x$. To convert $\frac{4}{x}$, the student multiplies numerator and denominator by 2: $\frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{8}{2x}$. Then, $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.
*   **B) Additive Error.** The student simply adds the numerators $(3 + 4 = 7)$ and adds the denominators $(2x + x = 3x)$. This is a very common misconception among students who treat fractions like vectors or simply "add across."
*   **C) Incomplete common denominator/Calculation error.** The student recognizes they need to double the 4, but fails to maintain the correct denominator. They may reach $3 + 8$ but decide the "new" denominator should just be $x$, or they multiplied the first fraction by $0.5$ (incorrectly) and kept $x$ as the base.
*   **D) Ignoring the need for a common denominator.** The student adds the numerators $(3 + 4 = 7)$ but correctly identifies that $2x$ is a potential common denominator. They "keep" the $2x$ from the first fraction but fail to adjust the second numerator ($4$) to account for the change in denominator.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK context:
*   **Below Basic:** Grade 1–2 students; struggling with numerical fractions and basic algebra.
*   **Basic:** Grade 3–4 students; understands the need for a common denominator but prone to systematic errors.
*   **Proficient:** Grade 5–6 students; confident with fractions, mostly consistent with algebra.
*   **Advanced:** Grade 7+ students; fluently manipulates algebraic expressions.

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Misconception) | C (Mixed error) | D (Partial work) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 60% | 10% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 35% | 25% | 10% | 30% |
| **Proficient** | 80% | 5% | 5% | 10% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0% | 1% |

**Teacher's Note:** Option **B** is the dominant distractor for lower-ability students because "adding across" is the most intuitive (though incorrect) action. Option **D** is the "trap" for mid-range students who remember a rule about keeping denominators the same but forget to apply the balancing multiplication to the numerator.
