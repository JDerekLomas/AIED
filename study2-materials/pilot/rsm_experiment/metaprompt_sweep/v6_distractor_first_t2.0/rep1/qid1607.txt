As an experienced UK maths teacher, I encounter this specific algebraic misconception frequently. It involves the inverse operations required to isolate a variable when dealing with fractions.

### Step 1 — Analysis of Reasoning

*   **A) Only step 1 (The Correct Analysis):** The student recognizes that the inverse of "divide by 4" is "multiply by 4," correctly resulting in $60 = 1 + k$. However, they also spot the error in Step 2, noting that to isolate $k$, they should subtract 1 ($60 - 1 = 59$) rather than adding it.
*   **B) Only step 2:** This is a rare choice. A student might choose this if they incorrectly performed Step 1 (perhaps thinking $15 \div 4 \approx 3.75$) but mistakenly believe $61 = k$ is the correct solution based on a total lack of understanding of the first line, or if they misread "Step 2" as an independent equation.
*   **C) Both steps are correct:** This is the most common distractor. The student correctly follows Step 1 but suffers from "operator persistence." They see the $+$ sign in $1 + k$ and instinctively add 1 to the 60, forgetting that to "move" the 1 across the equals sign, the inverse operation (subtraction) must be used.
*   **D) Both steps are incorrect:** The student fails to understand how to begin the problem. They might think you have to subtract 1 first (forgetting that the whole expression $1+k$ is being divided) or they might attempt to multiply only the 15 and not the $(1+k)$ part, leading them to believe the whole process is flawed.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, "Below Basic" refers to students working at Foundation Level Grade 1-2; "Basic" refers to Grade 3-4; "Proficient" refers to Grade 5-6; and "Advanced" refers to Grade 7+.

**below_basic:** A=10% B=10% C=40% D=40%
*Students here often struggle to start the problem and frequently guess "D" or follow the addition sign in "C".*

**basic:** A=35% B=5% C=50% D=10%
*This cohort understands the first step (multiplying by 4) but is highly susceptible to the error in step 2—adding 1 to 60 instead of subtracting.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=2% C=20% D=3%
*Most students at this level can successfully solve a two-step equation and will spot the sign error in the second step immediately.*

**advanced:** A=96% B=0% C=3% D=1%
*Advanced students see through the "trick" quickly. Occasional errors only occur due to rushing/reading the question too quickly.*
