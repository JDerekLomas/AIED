In the context of the UK National Curriculum, this question assesses a student's understanding of the "order of operations" in reverse when solving equations and their grasp of balancing equations.

**The Correct Answer is A (Only Tom).** 
*Tom added 5 to both sides (correct). Katie multiplied by 3 but failed to multiply the -5 by 3 (a classic common error).*

### Predicted Responses by Ability Level

**below_basic:** 
*Students at this level often struggle with the concept of an equation as a balance. They often pick "Both" because they assume if two people are named in a maths problem, they are likely both showing valid methods.*
*   **A=15% B=20% C=50% D=15%**

**basic:**
*Students understand that they need to "do something" to the numbers 3 and 5. Many will intuitively want to multiply by 3 first because it "gets rid of the fraction." They are highly susceptible to Katie's mistake (multiplying the term with $x$ but forgetting the constant).*
*   **A=30% B=25% C=40% D=5%**

**proficient:**
*These students are generally reliable at solving equations. They will recognize that Tom's step is the "standard" first move. However, a significant portion will see Katie's $12 \times 3 = 36$ and think "that looks like a correct step," forgetting that the $-5$ must also be scaled.*
*   **A=65% B=10% C=20% D=5%**

**advanced:**
*These students have a conceptual grasp of algebraic manipulation. They will immediately spot that Katie failed to distribute the multiplication across all terms on the left-hand side. They may even mentally verify Tom's method by solving for $x$ ($x=51$).*
*   **A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%**

### Teacher's Note on "The Katie Error":
Katie’s error ($x-5=36$) is one of the most persistent misconceptions in GCSE Foundation and higher-tier entry. Students often think of "moving the 3" rather than "multiplying the side." To help **Basic** and **Proficient** students, it is helpful to model Katie’s idea by drawing a bracket around the whole left side: $3(\frac{x}{3}-5) = 3(12)$.
