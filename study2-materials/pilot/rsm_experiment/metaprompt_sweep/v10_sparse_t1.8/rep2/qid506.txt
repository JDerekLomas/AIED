Here are the predicted student responses for a typical UK secondary school cohort (Years 7–11), categorised by ability level.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A ($p=1/4$):** The most common error. Students "see" the 3 and the 12 and perform the division $12 \div 3 = 4$, then place it back into the fraction structure without inverse operations.
*   **B ($p=1/36$):** The correct answer. Dividing both sides by 3 ($ \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{36}$).
*   **C ($p=4$):** Students perform $12 \div 3 = 4$ but ignore the fraction entirely, often assuming $p$ must be a whole number.
*   **D ($p=1/9$):** A less common "haloing" error where students might try to subtract 3 or misinterpret $3 \times 3$ patterns.

### Predicted Responses

**below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%**
*At this level, students rarely apply formal inverse operations to fractions. They rely on "number spotting." Nearly half will choose A because 3 and 12 naturally make 4. A significant portion will choose C because they are uncomfortable with fractional answers.*

**basic: A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%**
*These students are starting to understand that $p$ should be smaller than $1/12$, but the "12 divided by 3" intuition is very strong. Many will reach for option A as it "looks" like a maths answer they recognise.*

**proficient: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%**
*Proficient students (Grade 4/5) generally know they need to divide by 3. Most will successfully perform $1/12 \times 1/3 = 1/36$. The minority who get it wrong usually make a "working memory" slip and default to A.*

**advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%**
*Advanced students (Grade 7+) will recognise this instantly as a single-step equation. Errors here are almost exclusively due to rushing or misreading the question.*
