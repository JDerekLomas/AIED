### Teacher Analysis of Distractors

**The Correct Answer: C (5)**
By substituting $x=0$ into $4x + 2y = 10$, we get $4(0) + 2y = 10$, so $2y = 10$, meaning $y = 5$.

**A (20) – The "Multiplication" Error**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at **Below Basic** often see three numbers $(4, 2, 10)$ and perform a familiar operation without regard for the equals sign. They might see $4 \times 5 = 20$ or try to multiply the coefficients together. In some cases, they look at the first two digits in the equation ($4$ and $2$) and the $x=0$, getting confused by the $0$ and defaulting to $4 \times 5 = 20$ (the next logical product).
*   **Prevalence:** Very high in lower sets where students struggle with the concept of an equation.

**B (3) – The "Sequence" Error**
*   **Reasoning:** Students who understand how to find the gradient/step often try to "work backwards" or "forwards" before they've even found the first value. A student might correctly find that the next value (for $x=1$) is $y=3$ and accidentally put that in the first box.
*   **Prevalence:** Common in **Basic/Proficient** levels where they understand linear sequences but misread the table alignment.

**C (5) – The Target**
*   **Proficient/Advanced** students recognize this is a substitution task and can handle the two-step equation $2y = 10$ mentally.

**D (2.5) – The "Wrong Division" Error**
*   **Reasoning:** The student understands that they need to divide by one of the coefficients but picks the wrong one ($10 \div 4 = 2.5$) instead of $10 \div 2$. 
*   **Prevalence:** Common in **Basic** learners who have been told "divide the end number by the number in front of the letter" but forget which letter is being eliminated.
