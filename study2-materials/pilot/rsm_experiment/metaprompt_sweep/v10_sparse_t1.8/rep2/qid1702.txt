In the context of the UK GCSE Mathematics curriculum (Foundation/Higher tiers), this question tests linear substitution and solving two-step equations. 

The correct answer is **C) 3.3**.
*Calculation: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$*

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level:

**below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=10% D=40%**
*   **A/D Bias:** Students at this level struggle with rearranging. Many will try to combine all numbers seen in the question ($30 + 6 + 0.5$ or $30 / 10 + 6 \times 0.5$).
*   **Common Error (D):** Many will assume $y$ is the subject. They might do $(30 - 0.5) / 10 = 2.95$ (rounding to 2.7) or simply guess D because it "looks" like a common coordinate geometry answer.
*   **The "Add" Error (A):** They may mistakenly add the $10x$ and $6y$ and $0.5$ ($30 + 10 + 0.5 + 2$).

**basic: A=45% B=10% C=25% D=20%**
*   **Distractor A is the "trap":** These students often perform $10x + 3 = 30$ because they confuse the sign rules when "moving" terms. $30 + 3 = 33 \Rightarrow 3.3$ is the goal, but many will mistakenly calculate $30 + 6(2)$ or add instead of subtract initially. 
*   **Process Error:** They understand substitution ($10x - 3 = 30$) but fail at the inverse operation, thinking they need to subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it, or vice versa.

**proficient: A=15% B=5% C=75% D=5%**
*   **Competence:** Most students at this level can substitute $0.5$ correctly. They recognize that $6 \times 0.5 = 3$. 
*   **Careless Error (A):** The main loss of marks here is a sign error ($10x - 3 = 30$ becoming $10x = 27$ resulting in $2.7$, though 2.7 is D, the visual of $10x + 3 = 45$ or similar confusion leads them to A).

**advanced: A=2% B=1% C=96% D=1%**
*   **Mastery:** These students see this as a standard 1-mark or 2-mark "starter" question.
*   **Logic:** They quickly calculate $10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 33$. Errors are extremely rare and usually due to misreading $y$ as $x$ in the table.
