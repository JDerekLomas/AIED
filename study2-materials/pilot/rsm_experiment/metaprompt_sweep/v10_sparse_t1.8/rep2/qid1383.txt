As a UK maths teacher, I would analyse this question based on three specific potential pitfalls: the misconception that squaring/powering a number is the same as multiplying by the exponent, the handling of negative bases, and the "even power" rule.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level:

**below_basic:** A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
*   **Reasoning:** At this level, many students do not understand index notation. They will perform $3 \times 4 = 12$. Because they see a minus sign, they are roughly split between whether the answer stays negative or becomes positive, often guessing between B and D.

**basic:** A=35% B=10% C=45% D=10%
*   **Reasoning:** Students now recognise that $k^4$ means $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$. However, their understanding of directed numbers with indices is fragile. They often associate the negative sign in the question with a negative sign in the answer without applying the rule of even powers. This leads to a high frequency of "Option C".

**proficient:** A=75% B=2% C=22% D=1%
*   **Reasoning:** Most students at this level correctly calculate $81$ and know that $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$ results in a positive. However, a significant minority will still fall into the "calculator error" trap—subconsciously calculating $-3^4$ as $-(3^4)$ rather than $(-3)^4$, leading them to Option C.

**advanced:** A=97% B=0% C=3% D=0%
*   **Reasoning:** These students have mastered the substitution of negative numbers. The only errors here would be "slips" or rare over-generalisations, but Option A is the dominant and expected response.

| Level | A (81) | B (12) | C (-81) | D (-12) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **below_basic** | 10% | 45% | 5% | 40% |
| **basic** | 35% | 10% | 45% | 10% |
| **proficient** | 75% | 2% | 22% | 1% |
| **advanced** | 97% | 0% | 3% | 0% |
