In the context of the UK National Curriculum, this question tests a combination of **substitution**, **order of operations (BIDMAS)**, and **place value/decimal multiplication**. 

The correct answer is **B ($0.27$)**.
Calculation: $0.3^2 = 0.09$, then $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$.

Here is a prediction of student responses by ability level:

**below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=50% D=25%**
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level often disregard the square symbol or interpret $3x^2$ as $(3x) \times 2$. The most common error is $0.3 \times 3 \times 2 = 1.8$ (Option **C**). Others will simply multiply the base by the exponent $0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$, and then multiply by 3 to get $1.8$ anyway. Option **D** is chosen by those who do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then accidentally multiply by 3 again instead of squaring.

**basic: A=15% B=35% C=20% D=30%**
*   **Analysis:** These students recognize substitution but struggle with the hierarchy of operations. Many will calculate $(3 \times 0.3)^2$, leading to $0.9^2 = 0.81$ (Option **A**). Others will do $3 \times 0.3 \times 3 = 2.7$ (Option **D**), confusing the square with "times 3". At this level, many will correctly identify the steps but make a decimal point error, e.g., $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ (mistake) $\rightarrow 0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$.

**proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%**
*   **Analysis:** Most proficient students understand BIDMAS and know to square $0.3$ first. The primary distractor here is **D**; students may correctly calculate $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$, but then make a mental arithmetic slip when multiplying by 3, or they might calculate $0.3^2$ as $0.9$ (missing the second decimal place), leading them to $2.7$.

**advanced: A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%**
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level will almost all correctly identify $0.3^2 = 0.09$ and $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$. Errors here are almost exclusively "fat-finger" errors or extreme lapses in concentration. They are unlikely to be tricked by the common misconceptions of squaring the product ($0.81$).
