In the context of the UK GCSE Mathematics curriculum, this question tests two specific skills: understanding the mechanics of FOIL/expanding brackets and the manipulation of directed numbers (negative integers).

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level:

| Ability Level | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 35% | 15% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 30% | 5% | 20% |
| **Proficient** | 80% | 15% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0% | 1% |

### Teacher Commentary and Rationale

*   **Below Basic (Working towards Grade 2):**
    Students at this level struggle with the "operation" required. 
    *   **The common error is D (-5).** Many students see two negative numbers and instinctively perform an addition/subtraction $(-1 - 4 = -5)$ rather than a multiplication. 
    *   **B (-4)** is also a high-frequency distractor as they may forget that the minus sign "belongs" to the 1, or they simply multiply $1 \times -4$ and ignore the first negative.

*   **Basic (Working towards Grade 4 - Low C):**
    At this level, students understand that "expanding" means "multiplying." 
    *   **A (+4)** starts to become the modal answer, but a significant number still choose **B (-4)**. This is the classic "signs" error: they multiply $1 \times 4$ but forget that a negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive.
    *   **D (-5)** remains a "tired" error for those rushing or struggling with algebraic conventions versus arithmetic rules.

*   **Proficient (Grade 5/6 - B):**
    Most students in this tier are fluent with the FOIL method and the "double negative" rule.
    *   The 15% choosing **B (-4)** usually represents a "slip" under exam pressure rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.
    *   Very few will select C or D, as they have moved past the error of adding terms when they should be multiplying.

*   **Advanced (Grade 7+ - A/A*):**
    These students will find this question trivial.
    *   The almost 100% success rate on **A (+4)** reflects their total fluency. Any errors here are likely due to a misread of the question (e.g., identifying the wrong arrows) rather than a mathematical misunderstanding.
