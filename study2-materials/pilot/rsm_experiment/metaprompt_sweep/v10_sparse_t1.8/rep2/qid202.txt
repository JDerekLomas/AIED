Here are the predicted student responses for a typical UK Year 7/8 cohort, based on common misconceptions and performance data patterns found in KS3 assessments.

**below_basic:** A=20% B=15% C=35% D=30%
*   **Rationale:** Students at this level frequently succumb to the "add all numbers" trap. **C** is a very common distractor where they add the numerators ($1+2=3$) and denominators ($5+5=10$), and may even add the whole numbers to get a numerator like 18 ($11+7$). **D** is also highly likely, as they correctly add the whole numbers and numerators but incorrectly add the denominators.

**basic:** A=55% B=10% C=10% D=25%
*   **Rationale:** These students generally know to add the whole numbers and the fractions separately. However, the most persistent misconception at this level remains adding the denominators. **D** will be the primary "wrong" answer. They might avoid **B** or **C** because they recognize the format doesn't look like the requested mixed number.

**proficient:** A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
*   **Rationale:** Most students at this level have mastered adding fractions with common denominators. The main "error" here will actually be **B**. These students often convert to improper fractions to calculate ($11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$) and, in their haste, forget to convert back to a mixed number as requested by the prompt.

**advanced:** A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
*   **Rationale:** High-achieving students will find this question trivial. Errors will almost exclusively be down to "silly mistakes" (reading the operation as subtraction or multiplication) or, like the proficient group, failing to convert the final improper fraction in **B** back into a mixed number despite knowing how.

**Teacher's Note on Distractors:**
*   **Option A:** Correct.
*   **Option B:** Correct value, but wrong format (improper fraction).
*   **Option C:** The "Freshman's Dream" error (adding across).
*   **Option D:** Correct whole number/numerator addition, but adds denominators.
