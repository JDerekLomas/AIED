Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical UK secondary school assessment data (Key Stage 3/4).

In this context:
*   **Below Basic:** Grade 1-2 (Developing/Foundation)
*   **Basic:** Grade 3-4 (Standard Pass boundary)
*   **Proficient:** Grade 5-6 (Strong Pass/Higher Tier start)
*   **Advanced:** Grade 7-9 (Targeting A/A*)

### **Teacher Analysis of Options**
*   **A (Correct):** Recognising a common denominator is $2x$, so $\frac{4}{x}$ becomes $\frac{8}{2x}$. $3 + 8 = 11$.
*   **B (Misconception):** "Add across" logic. $3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$. Very common at lower levels.
*   **C (Misconception):** Incorrectly doubling the first numerator or simply adding the tops and assuming $x$ is the common denominator ($3+8$ but forgetting the /2).
*   **D (Misconception):** Adding numerators ($3+4$) but correctly identifying $2x$ as a common denominator.

### **Predicted Statistics**

**below_basic: A=15% B=55% C=10% D=20%**
*   *Rationale:* The vast majority will use "add across" logic (Option B), treat it like a simple sequence of numbers, and ignore the rules of common denominators entirely.

**basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%**
*   *Rationale:* Students here know they need a common denominator but often fail the execution. Many will correctly pick $2x$ as the denominator but forget to multiply the numerator (leading to Option D).

**proficient: A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%**
*   *Rationale:* At this level, students are fluent with fraction arithmetic. The most common error remains "forgetting to multiply the numerator" (D), while the "add across" error (B) almost disappears.

**advanced: A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%**
*   *Rationale:* This is a foundational algebraic fraction question for high achievers. Errors will almost exclusively be due to "calculation slip" (3+8=10) or rushing, rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.
