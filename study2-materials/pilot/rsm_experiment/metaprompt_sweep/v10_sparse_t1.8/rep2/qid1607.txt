In the UK secondary curriculum (Key Stage 3/4), this question tests the ability to inverse operations across an equals sign. Step 1 requires multiplying by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$), and Step 2 requires subtracting 1 ($60 - 1 = 59$). 

Isaac correctly performs Step 1 but fails Step 2 by adding 1 instead of subtracting it (a common "sign change" misconception).

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic:** A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level often lack the confidence to identify partial correctness. Many will see that Isaac "did some maths" and arrived at a number near the answer, leading them to select C. Others may guess randomly.

**basic:** A=45% B=10% C=30% D=15%
*   **Reasoning:** These students can often follow Step 1 (multiplying $15 \times 4$). However, many will see $61$ and think "one more than 60" is the logical next step without checking the inverse operation rule. There is a strong "distractor" pull toward C because they recognise the $60$.

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** Most students at this level will immediately spot that $60 - 1$ should be $59$. They are disciplined enough to check each step individually. They will identify Step 1 as correct but catch the arithmetic/balancing error in Step 2.

**advanced:** A=95% B=1% C=2% D=2%
*   **Reasoning:** Advanced students (Grade 7-9) will solve the equation mentally in seconds. They will clearly see that Step 2 is a "plus instead of minus" error. Errors in this group are usually due to misreading the question rather than mathematical misunderstanding.
