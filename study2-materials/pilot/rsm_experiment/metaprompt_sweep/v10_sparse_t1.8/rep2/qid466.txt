Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical classroom data and common misconceptions regarding negative numbers and reciprocal operations in the UK curriculum (KS3/KS4).

**Key Misconceptions:**
*   **Sign confusion:** Students often believe that to get a negative answer, both numbers must be negative, or they simply "lose" a negative sign during the calculation.
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative Inverse:** Below-basic students often confuse "negative reciprocals" with simple "negatives" or think the goal is to make the equation sum to zero rather than product to one.

### **Predicted Responses**

**below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%**
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level often focus on "cancelling out" the existing fraction visually. **C** is the most popular guess because they see a $-\frac{3}{4}$ and think adding a positive $\frac{3}{4}$ will result in the "1" they see on the right. They often ignore the multiplication sign entirely. **D** is chosen by those who think the star must match the first number exactly.

**basic: A=40% B=20% C=25% D=15%**
*   **Analysis:** Students here recognise that they need to flip the fraction to get "1" (the reciprocal), leading them to **A**. However, they frequently forget the rules of signs (Negative $\times$ Positive = Negative). They choose A because they want the "negative" to stay in the answer, not realising that a positive star maintains the negative result.

**proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%**
*   **Analysis:** Proficient students understand that $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = 1$. Most will correctly identify **A** because they perform the mental check: $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -\frac{12}{12} = -1$. Some will still gravitate toward **B** because they over-correct the negative signs, thinking "two negatives make a positive" applies to the final answer shown (forgetting the $-1$ is the target).

**advanced: A=94% B=4% C=1% D=1%**
*   **Analysis:** High-achieving students instantly recognise the property of the reciprocal. The very small percentage choosing **B** is usually attributed to "test fatigue" or rushing (applying the negative reciprocal rule used for perpendicular gradients by mistake).
