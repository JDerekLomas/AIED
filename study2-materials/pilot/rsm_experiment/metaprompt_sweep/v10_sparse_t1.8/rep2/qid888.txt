Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical UK secondary school data (GCSE foundation/higher tiers).

### Pedagogical Analysis:
*   **The Negative Rule:** The most common hurdle is $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$.
*   **Linear Term Summation:** The second hurdle is understanding $(-5) + (-7) = -12$.
*   **Mistake in "A":** This is a classic "Difference of two squares" confusion or simple subtraction mistake (7-5 instead of -7-5).

### Predicted Responses:

**below_basic (Working at Grade 1–2)**
*Focus: These students often struggle with negative number operations and may guess based on the signs they see.*
**A=40% B=15% C=15% D=30%**
*   **Reasoning:** Many will look at -5 and -7 and perform $7-5=2$ (Option A). Others will see two minus signs and conclude the end result must also be minus (Option D).

**basic (Working at Grade 3–4)**
*Focus: Students usually know FOIL or the Grid Method but consistently make "sign errors" when multiplying two negatives.*
**A=15% B=30% C=20% D=35%**
*   **Reasoning:** They successfully get the $12m$, but many will fail the final step $(-5 \times -7)$, thinking that a "minus and a minus make a minus" in terms of the constant, leading them to Option D.

**proficient (Working at Grade 5–6)**
*Focus: Generally solid with algebra but can make "slip" errors under exam pressure.*
**A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%**
*   **Reasoning:** The majority will correctly identify that $-5 \times -7 = +35$. The remaining 20% is split between "losing a sign" mid-calculation or rushing.

**advanced (Working at Grade 7–9)**
*Focus: Total fluency in expanding quadratics and directed numbers.*
**A=1% B=98% C=0% D=1%**
*   **Reasoning:** It is very rare for a student at this level to miss this question unless it is a "pencil slip" or misreading the question.
