In the UK secondary curriculum (Key Stage 3 and 4), this question tests two main concepts: **BIDMAS/BODMAS** (Order of Operations) and **directed numbers** (arithmetic with negatives).

The correct calculation is: $3 - 5 + (4 \times 2) \rightarrow 3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = \mathbf{6}$ (**Option A**).

Here is the predicted response breakdown by ability level:

### **below_basic**
**A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%**  
*   **Rationale:** Students at this level almost always work from left to right, ignoring BIDMAS entirely. They calculate $(3 - 5) + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$ (**B**). A significant portion will struggle with $3-5$ and may accidentally result in a larger negative number or simply guess (**D**).

### **basic**
**A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%**  
*   **Rationale:** These students have heard of BIDMAS and will prioritise $4 \times 2 = 8$. However, they often fall into the "Addition before Subtraction" trap. They may calculate $5 + 8 = 13$ and then $3 - 13 = -10$ (**D**). Some will still calculate left-to-right (**B**). Many will arrive at the correct answer but remain shaky on the negative number arithmetic.

### **proficient**
**A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%**  
*   **Rationale:** Most students at this level understand that Multiplication comes first. They are also aware that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right. The main source of error here is the "Addition first" misconception ($3 - 13$) leading to option **D**.

### **advanced**
**A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%**  
*   **Rationale:** Advanced students (Grade 7-9) will automatically identify the terms. They see $3, -5,$ and $+8$. They are unlikely to make an order-of-operations error, and any mistakes would likely be "finger-slips" or rare lapses in concentration.

**Key for common misconceptions:**
*   **A (Correct):** $3 - 5 + 8 = 6$
*   **B (Left-to-Right):** $3 - 5 = -2 \rightarrow -2 + 4 = 2 \rightarrow 2 \times 2 = 4$
*   **C (Incorrect BIDMAS/Negatives):** Often a result of adding everything then multiplying $(3+5+4) \times (-1 \dots)$ or various missteps.
*   **D (Addition before Subtraction):** $4 \times 2 = 8 \rightarrow 5 + 8 = 13 \rightarrow 3 - 13 = -10$ (The "AS" in BIDMAS trap).
