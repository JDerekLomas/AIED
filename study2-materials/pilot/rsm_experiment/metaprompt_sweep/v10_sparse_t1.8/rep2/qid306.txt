In the UK context (KS3/KS4), this question highlights two major misconceptions:
1. **The Left-to-Right Rule:** Students often believe they must always calculate strictly from left to right.
2. **The "BIDMAS Hierarchy" Fallacy:** A common misunderstanding where students think Addition *must* come before Subtraction simply because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym (the same applies to 'M' before 'D').

Here is the predicted distribution based on typical classroom performance:

**below_basic: A=65% B=15% C=15% D=5%**
*   **Logic:** These students generally ignore BIDMAS/order of operations entirely. They solve both problems by working strictly from left to right. They see $4+5$ in Problem Q as the first task because it appears first on the page.

**basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%**
*   **Logic:** These students have heard of BIDMAS but are confused by its application. Many will correctly choose $5 \times 6$ for Problem Q, but will fall into the trap of doing $5+6$ in Problem P because "Addition comes before Subtraction in the name BIDMAS." This leads to high percentages for **D** or **B**.

**proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%**
*   **Logic:** Proficient students understand that Multiplication takes priority (correctly identifying $5 \times 6$ for Q). Most have also mastered the rule that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right, though a few still get caught out by the literal order of the letters in BIDMAS (choosing D).

**advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%**
*   **Logic:** Advanced students recognise that Addition/Subtraction are a "package deal" worked left-to-right. They will almost universally choose **B**. The tiny percentage for D represents a momentary "brain fade" or overthinking the literal acronym.

**Teacher's Note on Correct Answer: B**
*   **Problem P:** Since Addition and Subtraction have equal priority, we work left to right ($4-5$ first).
*   **Problem Q:** Multiplication has a higher priority than addition ($5 \times 6$ first).
