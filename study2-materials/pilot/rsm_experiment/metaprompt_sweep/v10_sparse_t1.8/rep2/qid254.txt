As a UK maths teacher, I would interpret these ability levels based on GCSE targeting (Grade 1-9). This question is a classic "trap" because of the number zero and BIDMAS/calculator notation rules.

Here is the prediction for student responses:

**below_basic (Targeting Grade 1-2)**
*Focus: Usually forgets the 0 exists or assumes the sum only counts "numbers with value." Often doesn't understand the structure of a fraction bar.*
**A=10% B=45% C=40% D=5%**
*   **Why:** Many at this level will choose **C** because they see four non-zero numbers and divide by 4. **B** is popular because they write out what they intend to do on a calculator without using brackets, inadvertently following BIDMAS (dividing 7 by 5 first).

**basic (Targeting Grade 3-4)**
*Focus: Understands that 0 is a data point, but highly susceptible to calculator input errors and BIDMAS misconceptions.*
**A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%**
*   **Why:** They know to divide by 5, so they narrow it down to A and B. They often pick **B** because it "looks" like the calculation they would type left-to-right. Those who pick **A** are usually ignoring the 0 because it doesn't change the sum, but they realize there are 5 numbers.

**proficient (Targeting Grade 5-6)**
*Focus: Strong understanding of the mean formula. Generally recognizes that Option A is mathematically equivalent to the correct answer.*
**A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%**
*   **Why:** Most will identify that adding 0 doesn't change the numerator, so **A** is the "maths" answer. However, a significant portion will overthink and choose **D** (None) because they expect to see the "0" physically written in the numerator as per the formula.

**advanced (Targeting Grade 7-9)**
*Focus: Precise logic and recognition of equivalent expressions.*
**A=85% B=2% C=3% D=10%**
*   **Why:** Most will instantly see that $\frac{15}{5} = 3$ and that Option **A** correctly represents $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$. The small percentage choosing **D** are the "pedantic" high-achievers who believe that if the 0 isn't in the numerator, the expression is an incomplete representation of the dataset.

**Teacher's Answer Key:**
The correct answer is **A**. 
*   **B** is incorrect due to BIDMAS (order of operations).
*   **C** is incorrect because it divides by the wrong $n$.
*   **A** is correct because $0+1+3+4+7$ is identical to $1+3+4+7$, and it is correctly divided by 5.
