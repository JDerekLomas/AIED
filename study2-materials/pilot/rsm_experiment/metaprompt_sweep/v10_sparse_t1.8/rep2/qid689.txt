As a UK maths teacher, I would categorize this as a "low floor, high ceiling" diagnostic question. The common misconception lies in the order of division and the "inverse operation" shortcut that many students misapply.

Here is the prediction of student responses based on UK standard ability levels (KS3/KS4):

**below_basic:** 
*Most students at this level struggle with fractions and algebra. Many will see '10' and '5' and perform a simple multiplication (incorrectly thinking the inverse of division is always multiplication, regardless of the position of the variable) or simply choose at random.*
**A=15% B=55% C=20% D=10%**

**basic:**
*These students are the most likely to fall for the "10 divided by 5" trap. They recognize that $p$ is involved in a division, so they perform $10 \div 5$ to get 2. They have a "computational" view of the equals sign rather than an algebraic one.*
**A=25% B=30% C=40% D=5%**

**proficient:**
*These students are starting to grasp formal algebraic manipulation. However, a significant portion will still instinctively perform $10 \div 5$. Those who use a formal method (multiplying both sides by $p$) are much more likely to arrive at the correct answer.*
**A=45% B=15% C=38% D=2%**

**advanced:**
*Advanced students recognize that if $10 = 5/p$, then $p$ must be $5/10$. They have high fluency with reciprocals and are unlikely to make the common error of dividing the larger number by the smaller one by default.*
**A=85% B=2% C=12% D=1%**

### Summary Table

| Level | A (Correct) | B ($10 \times 5$) | C ($10 \div 5$) | D (Confusion) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **below_basic** | 15% | **55%** | 20% | 10% |
| **basic** | 25% | 30% | **40%** | 5% |
| **proficient** | **45%** | 15% | 38% | 2% |
| **advanced** | **85%** | 2% | 12% | 1% |

### Teacher's Note on Distractors:
*   **B ($p=50$):** This is the classic "I see a fraction, I must multiply" error. Common among students who have been taught "tricks" without understanding the underlying balance of an equation.
*   **C ($p=2$):** The most common error for middle-ability students. It is caused by the intuitive but incorrect logic that "the answer is the result of dividing the numbers visible in the question" ($10 \div 5$).
*   **A ($p=0.5$):** Requires the student to correctly rearrange the equation to $10p = 5$ and then $p = 5/10$.
