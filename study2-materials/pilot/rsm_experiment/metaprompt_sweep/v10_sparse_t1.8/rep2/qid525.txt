Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical UK classroom misconceptions at Key Stage 3 and GCSE level.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
*   **A ($ \frac{99}{20} $):** The mathematically correct value, but in improper fraction form.
*   **B ($ 4 \frac{19}{20} $):** The correct answer (Mixed Number).
*   **C ($ \frac{99}{40} $):** A common error where the student finds a common denominator by multiplying ($10 \times 4$), but fails to adjust numerators correctly or incorrectly doubles the denominator.
*   **D ($ 4 \frac{8}{14} $):** The most common "Low Ability" error: adding the whole numbers ($2+2$), then adding the numerators ($7+1$) and adding the denominators ($10+4$).

### Predicted Responses

**below_basic:**
**A=10% B=20% C=25% D=45%**
*At this level, students almost instinctively add across the numerators and denominators. They struggle with the concept of a common denominator. Option D will be the most popular choice as it "looks" like the simplest way to solve it.*

**basic:**
**A=15% B=40% C=15% D=30%**
*These students know they need a common denominator but often make "slippy" mistakes. Many will still fall for the trap of adding denominators (D), while others will convert to improper fractions successfully but forget to convert back to a mixed number (A), despite the instruction.*

**proficient:**
**A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%**
*Proficient students (Grade 4/5) usually handle the common denominator ($20$) well. The main lost marks here come from "skimming" the question and selecting Option A—the right value but wrong format—or a calculation error when converting $2 \frac{7}{10}$ to $ \frac{27}{10} $.*

**advanced:**
**A=5% B=94% C=0% D=1%**
*Top-set students will recognise the need for the mixed number format immediately. The very small percentage for A represents "exam haste." Errors for C or D are negligible at this level.*
