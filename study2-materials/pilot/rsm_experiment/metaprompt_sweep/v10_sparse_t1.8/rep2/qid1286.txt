In the context of the UK curriculum (GCSE Higher Tier), this question tests **changing the subject of a formula** involving powers and roots.

The correct derivation is: 
$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \implies 3V = 4\pi r^3 \implies \frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3 \implies r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$ **(Option C)**.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic (Grade 3/Low 4)**
*Students often do not know the sphere volume formula from memory and struggle with multi-step rearrangement. Many will pick A because it "looks" like the standard formula components multiplied together.*
**A=45% B=25% C=15% D=15%**

**basic (Grade 5)**
*Students recognize the formula but struggle with the fraction $4/3$. They often incorrectly multiply by 4 and divide by 3, leading to Option B. Others mistake the cube root's reach.*
**A=25% B=40% C=25% D=10%**

**proficient (Grade 6/7)**
*These students can rearrange the formula confidently. The main errors here are "careless" slips (flipping the fraction) or selecting D due to a misunderstanding of how the cube root applies to the coefficients.*
**A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%**

**advanced (Grade 8/9)**
*Highly proficient. They likely perform the rearrangement mentally or in one step. They are unlikely to be distracted by the incorrect fraction orientation.*
**A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%**
