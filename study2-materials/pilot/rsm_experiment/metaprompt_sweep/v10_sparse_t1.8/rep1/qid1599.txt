In the UK secondary curriculum (Key Stage 3 and 4), the division symbol ($\div$) transitioning to the vinculum (fraction bar) is a common hurdle. Common misconceptions involve "left-to-right" priority (Option C) and the "reciprocal error" where the divisor and dividend are swapped (Option D).

Here is the prediction based on typical UK classroom data:

**below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%**
*At this level, students are often guessing or over-focusing on familiar numbers. There is little understanding that the fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol. D is a very common "visual" error where they place the longer expression on top.*

**basic: A=55% B=5% C=20% D=20%**
*Students at 'Basic' (Grade 2/3) recognize that division looks like a fraction. However, a significant portion will still choose C because they process the $c \div h$ first and simply "tack on" the $+4$, or choose D by mistakenly identifying the order.*

**proficient: A=85% B=2% C=8% D=5%**
*Working at a 'Secure' level (Grade 5), most students have mastered basic algebraic notation. The small percentage of errors usually comes from rushing and selecting C (misinterpreting the priority of operations) or D (accidental inversion).*

**advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%**
*High-ability students (Grade 7+) will find this question trivial. Errors are almost exclusively down to "silly" mistakes—misreading the letters or clicking the wrong button under time pressure.*
