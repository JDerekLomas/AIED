Here are the predicted response percentages based on common misconceptions seen in UK secondary classrooms (KS3/KS4).

**Key Misconceptions:**
*   **A:** Difference/Subtraction error. The student subtracts the smaller number from the larger (7-5) rather than adding two negatives.
*   **B:** **Correct.**
*   **C:** The "double negative" rule applied incorrectly to the middle term, or simply ignoring signs and treating both as positive.
*   **D:** Multiplication error with directed numbers. Student knows $-5 + -7 = -12$, but incorrectly thinks $-5 \times -7 = -35$.

---

### **below_basic (Working at Grade 1–2)**
*These students often struggle with the directed number aspect and the FOIL/Grid method mechanics.*
**A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%**
*   **Analysis:** High distribution across distractors. Many will pick C because they prefer positive signs. Many pick A because they see 7 and 5 and perform $7-5$.

### **basic (Working at Grade 3–4)**
*These students understand they need to multiply four terms, but frequently make errors with the final constant sign or the addition of the middle terms.*
**A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%**
*   **Analysis:** Option D is a very common "trap" here; students get the $-12m$ correct but falter on $-5 \times -7$. B becomes the most popular, but confidence is low.

### **proficient (Working at Grade 5–6)**
*These students are fluent with the distributive law and usually handle directed numbers well, but may make a "silly mistake" under pressure.*
**A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%**
*   **Analysis:** Most have mastered the "two negatives make a positive" rule for the constant. D remains the primary distractor for those working too quickly.

### **advanced (Working at Grade 7–9)**
*These students are highly fluent and can often expand this mentally without a grid.*
**A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%**
*   **Analysis:** Mistakes are rare and usually down to clerical errors (misreading the question) rather than a lack of mathematical understanding.
