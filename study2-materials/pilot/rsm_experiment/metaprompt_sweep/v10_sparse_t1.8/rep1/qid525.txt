Here are the predicted student responses for a typical UK Year 7–9 cohort, based on common misconceptions and GCSE foundation-level performance data.

**The Question Analysis:**
*   **Correct Answer:** **B** ($2 \frac{14}{20} + 2 \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$)
*   **Distractor A:** The correct value, but given as an improper fraction (ignores "Leave your answer as a mixed number").
*   **Distractor C:** Mistake in finding a common denominator (multiplies $10 \times 4$) but forgets to scale the numerators correctly, or simply combines numbers incorrectly.
*   **Distractor D:** The most common "low-ability" error—adding the whole numbers, then adding the numerators and denominators ($7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$).

### **Predicted Responses**

**below_basic: A=5% B=15% C=20% D=60%**
*   Students at this level almost always gravitate toward **D**. It follows the "intuitive" path of adding across (the same way they might mistakenly multiply fractions). They rarely understand the need for a common denominator.

**basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%**
*   Students here are starting to remember the "common denominator" rule but often execute it inconsistently. A significant portion will still default to **D** if they are rushing or lacking confidence. Many will reach the correct value but may choose **C** through calculation errors.

**proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%**
*   Most proficient students will find the common denominator (20) and add correctly. The primary error here is **A**—failing to read the final part of the instruction ("Leave your answer as a mixed number"). They do the hard work of converting to $\frac{99}{20}$ and stop there.

**advanced: A=5% B=94% C=0% D=1%**
*   Advanced students will identify the correct process immediately. The 5% for **A** accounts for "silly mistakes" in reading the prompt, and the 1% for **D** accounts for rare bubbling errors on a multiple-choice sheet.
