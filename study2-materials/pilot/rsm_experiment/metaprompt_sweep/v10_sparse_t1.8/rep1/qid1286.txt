In the context of the UK curriculum (GCSE Higher Tier), this question tests the ability to recall the volume of a sphere formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ and rearrange it to make $r$ the subject.

The most common errors involve incorrect algebraic manipulation (not multiplying by the reciprocal of the fraction) or forgetting that $\pi$ is in the numerator of the original formula.

**Predicted Student Responses:**

**below_basic:** A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
*Context: These students likely do not know the formula. They will choose **A** because it groups the numbers (4, 3, $\pi$) in a way that "looks" like the sphere formula they might vaguely recall from a formula sheet, without understanding the inverse operations required.*

**basic:** A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
*Context: Students at this level recognise the formula but struggle with the multi-step rearrangement. Many will pick **B** because they correctly move the 4 and the 3 but fail to realise that $\pi$ stays "with" the 4 on the denominator when dividing.*

**proficient:** A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
*Context: These are solid Grade 6/7 students. Most will successfully perform the steps: $3V = 4\pi r^3$, then $r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$. Some may still fall for the "visual trap" of B if they are rushing.*

**advanced:** A=2% B=3% C=93% D=2%
*Context: Grade 8/9 students. These students have high algebraic fluency and will perform the rearrangement mentally or on paper with high accuracy. Errors here are usually just misreading the options.*
