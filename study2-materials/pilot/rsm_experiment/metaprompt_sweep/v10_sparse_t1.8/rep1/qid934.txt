Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on typical UK secondary school data patterns (KS3/GCSE).

### **The Psychology of the Options**
*   **A) 20:** The "Multiplication Error." Students see the numbers 4 and 5 (or 10 and 2) and multiply them without regard for the equation's structure.
*   **B) 3:** The "Misplacement Error." This is the value for $y$ when $x=1$. Students often work out the second or third box first and lose track of which $x$ matches which $y$.
*   **C) 5:** **The Correct Answer.** $4(0) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 10 \rightarrow y = 5$.
*   **D) 2.5:** The "Division Error." Students ignore the $4x$ entirely and simply divide 10 by 4, or try to divide 10 by 2 then by 2 again.

### **Predicted Responses by Ability Level**

**below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%**
Students at this level often struggle with the concept of a "variable" and see the table as a prompt to simply do something with the numbers provided. Option **A** is the most common distractor here because "4 times 5 is 20" feels like a familiar maths fact, and they may associate the $x$ or $y$ with "timesing." Others pick **C** by sheer luck or by ignoring the $4x$ and just doing $10 \div 2$.

**basic: A=20% B=25% C=40% D=15%**
Students have begun to substitute but often make "positional" errors. Many will start by testing $x=1$ (perhaps because $x=0$ feels "too easy" or "weird") and calculate $y=3$. They then mistakenly put that 3 in the first box of the table. Their understanding of solving $2y=10$ is generally stable, leading to a higher success rate for **C**.

**proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%**
At this level (aiming for a Grade 5 at GCSE), students are comfortable with substitution. The most common error is **B**, usually caused by rushing and misreading the table header, or a minor mental arithmetic slip. They generally recognize that when $x=0$, the $4x$ term vanishes, making the calculation $10 \div 2$.

**advanced: A=1% B=2% C=96% D=1%**
Top-tier students (Grade 7+) will find this question trivial. They immediately identify that $x=0$ reduces the equation to $2y=10$. The 4% margin covers rare instances of "over-thinking" (expecting a trick) or simple clerical errors when clicking a multiple-choice box.
