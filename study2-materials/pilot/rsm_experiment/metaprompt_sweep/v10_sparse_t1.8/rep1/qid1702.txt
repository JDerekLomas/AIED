As a UK maths teacher, I would analyse this question based on GCSE foundation and higher tier expectations.

The correct mathematical process is:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$ (**Answer C**)

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level:

**below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=15% D=30%**
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level often struggle with formal substitution. **Option A** is the most common distractor because students "muddle the signs" or misuse a calculator: they might do $30 \div 10 + (6 \times 0.5) = 3 + 3 = 6$ (wrong) or perform $30 + 6 + 6.5...$ Many will simply guess **Option D** because 2.7 "looks like" it fits the pattern of numbers.

**basic: A=35% B=10% C=35% D=20%**
*   **Analysis:** These students (targeting a Grade 3) understand they need to plug numbers in but often fail the "balancing" part of the equation. Many will calculate $10x - 3 = 30$ but then subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it, leading to $10x = 27 \rightarrow x = 2.7$ (**Option D**). Others will guess **Option A** if they can't handle the two-step rearrangement.

**proficient: A=10% B=5% C=75% D=10%**
*   **Analysis:** These students (Grade 5/6) generally have strong substitution skills. They will correctly calculate $6 \times 0.5 = 3$. The main source of error here is a "slip" in arithmetic or signs, potentially leading to $10x = 27$ (Option D) if they are rushing.

**advanced: A=2% B=1% C=96% D=1%**
*   **Analysis:** High-ability students (Grade 7+) will treat this as a routine "easy" mark. The 4% error rate accounts for rare "silly errors" in transcription or mental arithmetic.
