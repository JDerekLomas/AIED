Here are the predicted student responses for a typical UK secondary school cohort (Year 7-9), categorized by ability level.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
*   **A (Correct):** The student adds whole numbers $(2+1=3)$ and numerators $(1+2=3)$ correctly.
*   **B (Misinterpretation):** The student correctly calculates the value but leaves it as an improper fraction, ignoring the instruction to "leave as a mixed number."
*   **C (Computational Failure):** The student adds both numerators and denominators ($1+2$ and $5+5$), a common misconception. They also fail to include the whole numbers.
*   **D (Conceptual Error):** The student adds the whole numbers correctly but also adds the denominators ($5+5=10$).

### Predicted Responses

**below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%**
*   **Rationale:** Students at this level almost universally attempt to add "everything." They will frequently add the denominators to get $10$. Many will pick **C** because they are used to single fractions and get confused by the whole numbers, simply ignoring them to make the problem look "familiar."

**basic: A=50% B=10% C=15% D=25%**
*   **Rationale:** These students have a basic grasp of fractions but lack confidence. They are likely to correctly add the whole numbers, but the urge to add the denominators ($5+5=10$) remains a high-frequency "reflex" error, leading them to **D**.

**proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%**
*   **Rationale:** These students understand that denominators stay the same. However, a significant minority will convert everything to improper fractions to solve it ($11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$). They will reach answer **B** and, out of haste, stop there without converting back to a mixed number.

**advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%**
*   **Rationale:** Most advanced students will find this trivial and see the mixed number addition as the most direct path. The very few who miss the mark usually do so by misreading the final instruction and selecting **B** (improper fraction) through over-complicating the method.
