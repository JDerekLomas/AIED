### Teacher's Analysis of Misconceptions

*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$): The "Add Everything" Error.**
    *   **Logic:** $3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$.
    *   **Student Profile:** Common in **Below Basic** students who treat fractions like integers and fail to find a common denominator. They apply the "addition" sign to both the numerator and the denominator.

*   **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$): The "Lost Coefficient" Error.**
    *   **Logic:** The student correctly identifies the need for a common denominator but chooses $x$ instead of $2x$. They double the $3$ instead of the $4$, or simply lose the $2$ during the simplification process.
    *   **Student Profile:** Frequently seen in **Below Basic/Lower Basic** students who have a weak grasp of how coefficients work in denominators.

*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$): The "Half-way" Error.**
    *   **Logic:** The student realizes the denominator should be $2x$, but they forget to adjust the numerator of the second fraction. They do $3 + 4$ over $2x$.
    *   **Student Profile:** This is the most common error for **Basic** and **Lower Proficient** students. They remember the rule "make the bottoms the same" but forget the golden rule: "whatever you do to the bottom, you must do to the top."

*   **Option A ($\frac{11}{2x}$): The Correct Approach.**
    *   **Logic:** Recognize the Lowest Common Multiple of $2x$ and $x$ is $2x$. Convert $\frac{4}{x}$ to $\frac{8}{2x}$. Calculate $\frac{3+8}{2x}$.
    *   **Student Profile:** **Proficient** students handle this comfortably. **Advanced** students will solve this mentally in seconds with near 100% accuracy.
