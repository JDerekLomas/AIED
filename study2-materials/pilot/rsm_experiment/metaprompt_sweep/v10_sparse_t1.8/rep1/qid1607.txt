In the UK secondary curriculum (Key Stage 3 and 4), this question tests a student's ability to identify inverse operations in multi-step equations. 

Step 1 is **correct** (multiplying both sides by 4).
Step 2 is **incorrect** (Isaac added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting 1).

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses based on typical classroom data and common misconceptions (such as "performing the inverse to one side but not the other" or "mixing up addition and subtraction").

**below_basic:** A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
*Students at this level often assume the final answer shown (k=61) must be right if they see "maths" happening, or they incorrectly follow the 'plus' sign in the equation and think adding 1 is the correct move for both steps.*

**basic:** A=40% B=10% C=40% D=10%
*This group usually recognises that Step 1 is correct (the 4 moved). However, a large percentage will still fall for the common error in Step 2, believing that "60 and 1 makes 61" without checking the inverse operation rule.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
*Proficient students (working at a strong GCSE Grade 4/5) will quickly verify Step 1. Most will catch the error in Step 2, though some may work too quickly and see $60+1$ and $61$ and reflexively tick 'Correct' without looking at the 'k' on the other side.*

**advanced:** A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
*Advanced students will instantly solve the equation themselves ($k=59$) and compare. They will identify the 'sign error' in Step 2 immediately. Errors here are usually due to misreading the question (e.g., misreading 'Only' for 'Both').*
