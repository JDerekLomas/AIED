As a UK maths teacher, this is a classic "trick" question that assesses two things: the understanding of the number zero in statistics and the understanding of order of operations (BIDMAS) in calculator notation.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

**below_basic:** 
A=30% B=15% C=50% D=5%
*   **Rationale:** Most students at this level believe that because zero "is nothing," you shouldn't count it as a data point. They will gravitate towards Option C because it has a divisor of 4. Others will choose A because they recognize the sum looks "right" even if the 0 is missing, but few will spot that A is actually the only correct mathematical representation here.

**basic:**
A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
*   **Rationale:** These students are beginning to remember that "zero counts," making them less likely to pick C. However, they are highly susceptible to Option B because that is exactly how they would type it into a non-scientific calculator, failing to realize that without brackets, only the 7 is being divided by 5 (BIDMAS).

**proficient:**
A=75% B=10% C=5% D=10%
*   **Rationale:** These students understand that 0 must be included in the count ($n=5$). They recognize that $0+1+3+4+7$ is the same as $1+3+4+7$ in the numerator. They are usually wary of Option B because they've been scolded about brackets and fraction lines in class. Some might overthink it and choose D, believing the 0 *must* be physically visible in the sum.

**advanced:**
A=95% B=2% C=0% D=3%
*   **Rationale:** Advanced students quickly identify that $\frac{\sum x}{5}$ is the goal. They see that A is mathematically identical to $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$. They immediately dismiss B due to BIDMAS and C because the frequency is wrong. A tiny percentage might choose D if they are being pedantic about the "completeness" of the expression.

### Final Table:

**below_basic:** A=30% B=15% C=50% D=5%  
**basic:** A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%  
**proficient:** A=75% B=10% C=5% D=10%  
**advanced:** A=95% B=2% C=0% D=3%
