In the context of the UK National Curriculum, this question tests a student's understanding of **precedence (order of operations)** and **inverse operations** when rearranging linear equations.

**The Logic:**
*   **Tom** is correct because he added 5 to both sides ($12 + 5 = 17$). This is the conventional first step.
*   **Katie** is **incorrect**. She multiplied the $x/3$ and the $12$ by $3$, but forgot to multiply the $-5$. For her to be correct, her line would have to be $x - 15 = 36$.

Here are the predicted responses by ability level:

### **below_basic**
**A=40% B=15% C=30% D=15%**
*   Students at this level often focus on one operation they recognize. Many will see Tom’s "+5" as "obvious" and pick A.
*   A significant portion will choose C because they assume in a "Tom and Katie" question, both methods must be valid ways of starting.
*   Distractor B/D accounts for those guessing or miscalculating the simple addition.

### **basic**
**A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%**
*   This group is most prone to the **"C" trap**. They recognize Tom is right, and they see that Katie has multiplied by 3 ($12 \times 3 = 36$), which "feels" like a valid mathematical move.
*   They often fail to realize that if you multiply an equation by a denominator, you must multiply **every** term. They lack the procedural fluency to spot the error in Katie’s "expansion."

### **proficient**
**A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%**
*   Most students at this level understand that Tom's step is the "standard" way.
*   They are much more likely to check Katie's work by actually attempting the multiplication. While some will still be fooled by Katie’s 36, the majority will notice the -5 remains unchanged and identify it as an error.

### **advanced**
**A=95% B=0% C=4% D=1%**
*   Advanced students will instantly spot the distributive property error in Katie’s logic. They know that if she multiplies by 3, it must be $3(\frac{x}{3} - 5) = 3(12)$.
*   The small percentage for C accounts for "speed errors" where the student sees the 36 and 17 and assumes both are derived from correct inverse operations without looking closely at the -5.

**Correct Answer: A**
