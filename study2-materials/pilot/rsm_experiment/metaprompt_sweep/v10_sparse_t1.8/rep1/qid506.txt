Here is the predicted distribution of student responses based on typical UK secondary school performance data (Year 7-11) for this specific type of fractional linear equation.

**Key Misconceptions:**
*   **The "3 into 12" trap:** Many students see 3 and 12 and immediately think "4," leading to Option A or C.
*   **The "Cross-Multiplication" error:** Some students mentally treat $3p$ as $3/p$ or try to multiply the 3 by the numerator instead of the denominator.
*   **The Inverse Operation:** Distinguishing between multiplying by 3 and dividing by 3 (or multiplying by $1/3$).

**below_basic:** A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
*   *Analysis:* These students prioritize whole-number arithmetic over algebraic rules. A significant number will choose **A** because "12 divided by 3 is 4." Others will choose **C** by ignoring the fraction entirely and treating it as $12 \div 3$.

**basic:** A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%
*   *Analysis:* At this level, students know they need to "move the 3" and that it involves division. However, many will mistakenly divide the 12 by 3 (Option **A**) rather than multiplying the denominator by 3. This group has the highest competition between the correct answer (**B**) and the "intuitive" trap (**A**).

**proficient:** A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
*   *Analysis:* These students (typically Grade 5/6 at GCSE) understand that to solve for $p$, they must divide by 3, which is the same as multiplying the denominator. Most will correctly calculate $12 \times 3 = 36$. Occasional slips lead them back to **A**.

**advanced:** A=2% B=97% C=1% D=0%
*   *Analysis:* High-achieving students (Grade 7+) see this as a trivial one-step calculation. They recognize that $p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{36}$ immediately. The 3% deviation accounts for rare "silly" reading errors.
