As a UK maths teacher, I see this specific question as a "trap" regarding BIDMAS/order of operations and the properties of negative numbers. It highlights the common confusion between $(-3)^4$ and $-3^4$.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses based on typical classroom data:

**below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%**
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level often treat indices as multiplication. Option B is the result of $3 \times 4$, and Option D is $(-3) \times 4$. There is a very high "surface feature" attraction to the numbers 3 and 4, leading them to ignore the power entirely.

**basic: A=25% B=15% C=50% D=10%**
*   **Analysis:** These students understand that they need to multiply $3$ by itself four times, reaching $81$. However, they rarely apply the rule that an even power turns a negative base positive. They likely calculate $3^4 = 81$ and then simply "tack" the negative sign back on at the end.

**proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%**
*   **Analysis:** Most proficient students know that $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = +81$. The 25% who choose C are often the victims of "calculator syntax" errors—if they typed $-3^4$ into a scientific calculator without brackets, the calculator gives $-81$. They trust the screen over their own knowledge of even powers.

**advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%**
*   **Analysis:** High-ability students recognise this as a "check" on negative number rules. The only reason an advanced student would miss this is a momentary lapse in concentration or the same "calculator input" error mentioned above. They will almost never choose B or D.
