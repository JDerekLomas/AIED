As a UK maths teacher, I would categorize these levels based on typical GCSE performance (Foundation/Higher tiers). 

This specific question targets **integer operations** (multiplying negatives) and **distinguishing between operations** (multiplication vs. addition).

### Predicted Student Responses

| Ability Level | A) $+4$ | B) $-4$ | C) $+5$ | D) $-5$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** (Grade 1-2) | 20% | 25% | 15% | **40%** |
| **Basic** (Grade 3-4) | 40% | **35%** | 5% | 20% |
| **Proficient** (Grade 5-6) | **75%** | 15% | 5% | 5% |
| **Advanced** (Grade 7+) | **98%** | 1% | 0% | 1% |

### Teacher's Rationale and Error Analysis

#### **Below Basic (Focus on "The Minus Sign Confusion")**
Students at this level often fail to recognise that expanding brackets involves multiplication. 
*   **The common error (D):** They see $-1$ and $-4$ and mentally add them to get $-5$. This is the most common distractor for students who struggle with the "process" of algebra.
*   **The error (B):** They might multiply $1 \times 4$ but simply "carry down" the negative sign without applying the negative $\times$ negative rule.

#### **Basic (Focus on "Signs and Operations")**
Students at this level know they are supposed to multiply because they have practiced the FOIL or Grid method, but their grasp of directed numbers is shaky.
*   **The common error (B):** Many students at this level still believe "a negative and a negative makes a negative." They successfully multiply $1 \times 4 = 4$, but incorrectly assign a negative sign. 
*   **The error (D):** Some still revert to addition $(-1 - 4 = -5)$ when they are feeling unconfident.

#### **Proficient (Focus on "Computational Accuracy")**
These students have mastered the mnemonic "Negative times a negative is a positive." 
*   **Success (A):** The majority will identify that $(-1) \times (-4) = +4$. 
*   **The residual error (B):** If they make a mistake, it is usually a "slip" under pressure where they forget to multiply the signs, focusing only on the integers.

#### **Advanced (Focus on "Mastery")**
*   **Success (A):** For a Grade 7+ student, this is a "check-your-working" step that is almost automatic. A mistake here would be an extreme rarity/fluke. They are more likely to spend their cognitive load on the $2p \times 3p$ or the middle terms of the expansion.
