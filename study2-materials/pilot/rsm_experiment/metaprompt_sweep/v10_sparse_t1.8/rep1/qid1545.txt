In the UK context, this question primarily tests **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction).

The calculation breaks down as:
*   **Left Side:** $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$
*   **Right Side:** $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$
*   **Comparison:** $11 > 5$. The correct answer is **A**.

Here is the prediction of student responses by ability level (Key Stage 3/4):

**below_basic:** A=20% B=25% C=50% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level often lack BIDMAS awareness. They usually calculate "left-to-right" on both sides. Left: $(8+12)\div4 = 5$. Right: $(8+12)\div4 = 5$. Because they get $5$ for both, **C** is the most common distractor.

**basic:** A=35% B=20% C=40% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** These students have heard of BIDMAS but apply it inconsistently. Many will still fall into the "left-to-right" trap on the first expression. Some might guess **B** if they intuitively feel the brackets on the right make that side "bigger."

**proficient:** A=75% B=10% C=10% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** Most students at this level reliably use BIDMAS. They will correctly identify that $12 \div 4$ happens first on the left. Errors usually come from mental arithmetic slips (e.g., $12 \div 4 = 4$).

**advanced:** A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
*   **Reasoning:** Advanced students will instantly recognize the structural difference the brackets make. They will likely solve it mentally in seconds with very high accuracy. Any errors are typically "silly mistakes" (transcription errors).
