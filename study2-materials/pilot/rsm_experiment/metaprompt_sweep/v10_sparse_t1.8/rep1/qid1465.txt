In the UK secondary mathematics context, this question tests two distinct skills: **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)** and **Directed Numbers (Arithmetic with Negatives)**.

The correct calculation is: $3 - 5 + (4 \times 2) \Rightarrow 3 - 5 + 8 \Rightarrow -2 + 8 = \mathbf{6}$.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic:** 
*These students almost always work strictly left-to-right, ignoring BIDMAS entirely. Many will also struggle with the negative jump from $3 - 5$.*
*   **Calculation:** $3 - 5 = -2$; then $-2 + 4 = 2$; then $2 \times 2 = 4$. 
*   **Alternative:** Some may do $5+4 = 9$ then $3-9 = -6$ (not an option).
*   **A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%**

**basic:**
*Students at this level are aware of BIDMAS but often apply it rigidly and incorrectly (e.g., thinking Addition *must* come before Subtraction) or make signs errors.*
*   **Calculation (The "AS" trap):** They do $4 \times 2 = 8$, then they see $+$, so they do $5 + 8 = 13$, then $3 - 13 = -10$.
*   **Calculation (Left-to-Right):** Some still default to the $3-5+4 \dots$ sequence.
*   **A=30% B=25% C=15% D=30%**

**proficient:**
*These students know to do $4 \times 2$ first. The main hurdle here is the directed number calculation $-2 + 8$.*
*   **Calculation:** $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 + 8$. They usually calculate $3-5 = -2$ then add $8$ to get $6$.
*   **Error:** Some might still fall for the "Addition before Subtraction" rule ($5+8=13 \rightarrow 3-13 = -10$).
*   **A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%**

**advanced:**
*These students automatically identify the multiplication term and are comfortable crossing the zero point on a number line.*
*   **Calculation:** $3 - 5 + 8 \Rightarrow 6$. 
*   **Potential Error:** Very rare; usually a "silly mistake" or overthinking the negative sign ($3 - [5+8]$).
*   **A=92% B=2% C=1% D=5%**

### Summary Table

| Ability Level | A (6) | B (4) | C (-12) | D (-10) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **below_basic** | 10% | 60% | 15% | 15% |
| **basic** | 30% | 25% | 15% | 30% |
| **proficient** | 65% | 10% | 5% | 20% |
| **advanced** | 92% | 2% | 1% | 5% |

**Key Misconceptions:**
*   **Option B:** Calculating left-to-right (The "Reading a Sentence" error).
*   **Option D:** Treating BIDMAS as a rigid hierarchy where Addition happens before Subtraction ($5+8=13$, then $3-13$), rather than seeing Addition and Subtraction as equal priority.
*   **Option C:** Often a result of adding $3-5 = -2$ and $4+2=6$ then multiplying them.
