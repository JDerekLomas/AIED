In a UK secondary school context (Key Stage 3 or GCSE), this question tests three distinct skills: substitution, order of operations (BIDMAS), and calculating with decimals.

The most common "distractor" here is misapplying the order of operations—specifically multiplying $3 \times 0.3$ before squaring.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic (Working at Grade 1/2)**
*These students struggle with decimal place value and powers. Many will instinctively perform the operation that looks "simplest."*
*   **A: 20%** (Misunderstanding squaring/place value).
*   **B: 15%** (Calculated $0.3^3$ or guessed).
*   **C: 45%** (The "Linear" trap: They do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ then square it, or they calculate $2 \times 3 \times 0.3$ because they see the exponent 2 and think 'multiply by 2').
*   **D: 20%** (Arrived here through luck or messy calculation).

**basic (Working at Grade 3/4)**
*These students know $x^2$ means $x \times x$, but frequently forget BIDMAS, performing the calculation from left to right.*
*   **A: 15%**
*   **B: 10%**
*   **C: 50%** (**The BIDMAS error:** They calculate $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, then $0.9^2 = 0.81$, but then somehow get lost in decimals or pick C because it "looks" like 1.8/0.18/0.81). *Crucially, many in this bracket will see $(3 \times 0.3)^2$ as the way to solve it.*
*   **D: 25%** (Starting to understand the substitution but making errors with decimal points).

**proficient (Working at Grade 5/6)**
*These students understand $y = 3(0.3^2)$. However, the most common error here is the "decimal slip" ($0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ instead of $0.09$).*
*   **A: 35%** (**The Decimal Slip:** $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$; then $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$. They then adjust the decimal incorrectly to 0.81 or similar).
*   **B: 15%** (Correct logic but placed the decimal wrong: $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$).
*   **C: 10%** (Residual BIDMAS errors).
*   **D: 40%** (**The Mistake:** $0.3^2$ is mistakenly identified as $0.9$, leading to $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$).

**advanced (Working at Grade 7+)**
*These students correctly identify that powers come before multiplication and are fluent in decimal arithmetic.*
*   **A: 5%**
*   **B: 85%** (Correct: $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$; $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$).
*   **C: 2%**
*   **D: 8%** (Occasional "brain fade" where $0.3^2$ is called $0.9$ under time pressure).

**Teacher's Note:** The transition from "Proficient" to "Advanced" on this specific question relies almost entirely on whether the student realizes $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$ and not $0.9$. This is
