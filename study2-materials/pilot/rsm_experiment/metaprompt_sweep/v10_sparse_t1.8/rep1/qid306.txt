In the UK context, these responses are heavily influenced by the teaching of **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction).

A significant issue in UK maths classrooms is the literal interpretation of the acronym BIDMAS, leading many students to believe that Addition *must* happen before Subtraction, rather than treating them with equal priority from left to right.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic**
*Students at this level generally calculate left-to-right regardless of operators. They often do not use BIDMAS or find the order of letters confusing.*
*   **A=65%** (Pure left-to-right strategy for both)
*   **B=15%** (Random/Lucky guess)
*   **C=15%** (Remembers "A comes before S" in BIDMAS, but forgets the priority of Multiplication)
*   **D=5%** (Unlikely to identify priority correctly)

**basic**
*These students have been taught BIDMAS and apply it rigidly. They will correctly identify that multiplication comes before addition, but will likely fall into the "Addition before Subtraction" trap for Problem P.*
*   **A=20%** (Some still default to left-to-right)
*   **B=25%** (Identifies Multiplication correctly, but understands left-to-right for P)
*   **C=10%** (Applying "A before S" but forgetting the Multiplication rule)
*   **D=45%** (The "BIDMAS Trap": They see A before S in the acronym and believe they must do $5+6$ first, and they correctly identify $5 \times 6$ for the second part)

**proficient**
*Students at this level are confident with order of operations but may still be tripped up by the Subtraction vs. Addition priority under pressure or through "over-learning" the acronym.*
*   **A=5%**
*   **B=60%** (Most have mastered that Add/Sub are equal priority left-to-right)
*   **C=5%**
*   **D=30%** (Significant minority still "over-obey" the BIDMAS acronym by choosing $5+6$ first)

**advanced**
*These students understand that Addition and Subtraction are inverse operations with equal priority, and that the order is simply left-to-right for Problem P.*
*   **A=2%**
*   **B=92%** (Correct mathematical understanding)
*   **C=1%**
*   **D=5%** (Occasional over-thinking or "brain-fart" regarding the acronym letters)

### Summary Table

| Level | A | B (Correct) | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **below_basic** | 65% | 15% | 15% | 5% |
| **basic** | 20% | 25% | 10% | 45% |
| **proficient** | 5% | 60% | 5% | 30% |
| **advanced** | 2% | 92% | 1% | 5% |

**Teacher's Note:** Problem P is the primary "distractor" here. In the UK, the biggest hurdle to reaching "Proficient" is unlearning the myth that the 'A' in BIDMAS happens before the 'S'. Many students will mistakenly choose **D** because they have been taught the acronym too literally.
