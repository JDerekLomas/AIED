Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical UK classroom performance for Key Stage 3 and 4 students.

**The Key Misconceptions:**
*   **Sign confusion:** Students often know that two negatives make a plus, but get confused when the target answer is negative.
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative Inverse:** "Below Basic" students often look for the number that makes zero (additive) rather than one (multiplicative).
*   **Reciprocal mastery:** Identifying that a fraction multiplied by its flip equals 1.

### **below_basic**
*These students struggle with fraction operations and the rules of directed numbers. Many will choose **C** because they see "3/4" and want to "balance" it to 0 or simply don't understand the reciprocal.*
**A=15% B=10% C=45% D=30%**

### **basic**
*Students at this level recognize that the numbers need to "cancel out," leading them to the reciprocal (4/3). However, they frequently make a sign error, thinking that because the answer is negative, the multiplier must also be negative.*
**A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%**

### **proficient**
*These students (Grade 4/5) usually understand that a negative multiplied by a positive stays negative. They recognize the reciprocal property but a small percentage will still trip up on the sign or rush the mental calculation.*
**A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%**

### **advanced**
*These students (Grade 7+) instinctively recognize the multiplicative inverse. They will quickly verify that \( (-\frac{3}{4}) \times (\frac{4}{3}) = -\frac{12}{12} = -1 \). Errors here are almost exclusively due to "silly" mistakes or overthinking.*
**A=94% B=4% C=1% D=1%**

### **Summary of Rationales:**
*   **A (Correct):** The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3. Since the result is -1 and the first term is negative, the second must be positive.
*   **B (Common Distractor):** Students often think "it's a negative question, so it needs a negative answer."
*   **C (Identity Distractor):** Students confuse multiplying to get 1 with adding to get 0, or they simply pick the positive version of the original fraction.
*   **D (Copycat Distractor):** Weakest students often pick the number already present in the question.
