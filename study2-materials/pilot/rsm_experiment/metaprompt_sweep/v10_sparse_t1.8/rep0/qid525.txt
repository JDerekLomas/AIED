Here is the predicted response data for Year 7/8 students (Key Stage 3) based on common mathematical misconceptions.

**Teacher's Analysis of Distractors:**
*   **A ($ \frac{99}{20} $):** The mathematically correct value, but presented as an improper fraction.
*   **B ($ 4 \frac{19}{20} $):** The correct mixed number.
*   **C ($ \frac{99}{40} $):** Adding the numerators correctly but multiplying the denominators (common misconception).
*   **D ($ 4 \frac{8}{14} $):** Adding the whole numbers, then adding the numerators and adding the denominators ($ \frac{7+1}{10+4} $).

### **Predicted Student Responses**

**below_basic: A=5% B=15% C=30% D=50%**
*   **Primary Error:** The "Add Across" misconception. Most students at this level will add $7+1$ and $10+4$, leading them directly to **D**. Some may attempt to find a common denominator by multiplying $10 \times 4$ but fail to adjust the numerators, leading toward **C**.

**basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%**
*   **Primary Error:** Transitioning between methods. Many students in this bracket know they need a common denominator (likely 20 or 40) but often revert to adding the denominators when they get confused. A small portion will reach the correct value but choose **A** because they are used to improper fractions being the "final" step in classroom drills.

**proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%**
*   **Primary Error:** Failure to read the final instruction. These students have mastered the LCM (Lowest Common Multiple) of 20 and can convert accurately. The most common "error" here is selecting **A** (the correct value) while ignoring the instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number."

**advanced: A=2% B=97% C=0% D=1%**
*   **Primary Error:** Purely "silly errors" or slips in mental arithmetic. These students will immediately identify 20 as the denominator, convert to $2 \frac{14}{20} + 2 \frac{5}{20}$, and automatically format the answer as requested. An outlier might select **D** by clicking too quickly without looking at the numbers.
