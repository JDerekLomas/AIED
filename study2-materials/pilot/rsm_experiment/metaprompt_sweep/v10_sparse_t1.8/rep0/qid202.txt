Here are the predicted student responses for a typical UK Year 7/8 cohort, based on common misconceptions and assessment data.

**below_basic:** 
A=30% B=10% C=45% D=15%
*   **Reasoning:** The "Below Basic" student often treats fractions like whole numbers. **Choice C** is the classic misconception where the student adds the numerators AND the denominators ($2+1=3$; $1+2=3$; $5+5=10$) and fails to distinguish between the whole numbers and the fractions, often treating it as $3/10$ or incorrectly simplifying.

**basic:** 
A=50% B=15% C=15% D=20%
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level usually know to add the whole numbers ($2+1=3$). However, many will still make the mistake of adding the denominators ($5+5=10$), leading them to **Choice D**. Some may correctly convert to an improper fraction ($18/5$) but pick **Choice B** because it is mathematically equivalent, ignoring the instruction to leave it as a mixed number.

**proficient:** 
A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
*   **Reasoning:** Most proficient students will quickly calculate $3 \frac{3}{5}$. The small percentage choosing **Choice B** likely didn't read the final instruction ("leave your answer as a mixed number"). The denominator-adding error (D) is largely ironed out by this stage.

**advanced:** 
A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
*   **Reasoning:** Advanced students find the arithmetic trivial. Any error here is almost certainly a "silly mistake" caused by rushing and picking **Choice B** (the improper fraction equivalent) before reading the required format.
