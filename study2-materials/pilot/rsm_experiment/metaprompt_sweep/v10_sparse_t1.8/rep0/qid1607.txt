In the UK secondary curriculum, this question targets **Level 4/5 algebraic manipulation** (solving two-step equations). The primary misconception here is "inverse operation confusion," where a student correctly identifies that they need to move a constant but applies the wrong operation (adding 1 instead of subtracting 1).

Here is the predicted distribution of responses based on typical UK student data:

**below_basic:** A=25% B=15% **C=45%** D=15%
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level often associate "doing math" with getting an answer that "looks" right. They see that $15 \times 4 = 60$ (Step 1 looks correct) and they see $60 + 1 = 61$. Because they lack a firm grasp of inverse operations, they assume "Step 2" must be right because the arithmetic is correct, leading them to choose **C**.

**basic:** **A=40%** B=10% C=40% D=10%
*   **Analysis:** This group is split. Many will correctly identify that Step 1 is correct (multiplication). However, a large portion will still fall into the "additive trap" for Step 2. They often mistakenly believe that because the 1 is "being added" on the right, they should add it to the other side to "move it," or they simply perform the most intuitive arithmetic ($60+1$) without checking the balance.

**proficient:** **A=75%** B=5% C=15% D=5%
*   **Analysis:** These students (typically working at a Grade 4 or 5 at GCSE) have a solid understanding of "Balance." They will recognise that to "undo" $+1$, they must subtract 1. They will see $61=k$ as a clear error. The 15% who choose C are usually making a "speed error"—seeing that $60+1=61$ and failing to verify the algebraic rule.

**advanced:** **A=96%** B=1% C=2% D=1%
*   **Analysis:** Students working at Grade 7-9 will see the error instantly. Step 1 is a standard move to clear the denominator. They will immediately identify Step 2 as a sign error. Any errors here are likely due to misreading the question (e.g., thinking the question asked which step was *incorrect*).

**Teacher's Note:**
*   **Correct Answer: A**
*   **Step 1 is correct:** Multiplying both sides by 4 gives $60 = 1 + k$.
*   **Step 2 is incorrect:** To isolate $k$, you must subtract 1 from both sides, leading to $59 = k$. Isaac added 1 instead.
