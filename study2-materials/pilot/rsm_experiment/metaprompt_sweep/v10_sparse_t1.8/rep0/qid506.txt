Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical UK secondary school assessment data (Key Stage 3/4).

### Teacher's Analysis of Distractors:
*   **A ($p=1/4$):** The most common error. Students see '3' and '12' and perform $12 \div 3$, ignoring the fact that 12 is a denominator.
*   **B ($p=1/36$):** The **Correct Answer**. Requires multiplying both sides by $1/3$ (or dividing by 3), leading to $1/(12 \times 3)$.
*   **C ($p=4$):** A "dual-process" error. Students calculate $12 \div 3 = 4$, then fail to realise the reciprocal nature of the original fraction.
*   **D ($p=1/9$):** A cognitive "near-miss." Students often think $3 \times 3$ instead of $12 \times 3$, or attempt to subtract 3 from 12 incorrectly.

### Predicted Response Distributions:

**below_basic:**
*Targeting students working at Grade 1–2 (GCSE). They often treat fractions as two separate whole numbers.*
**A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%**
*Reasoning:* Most will see "3" and "12" and intuitively pick A or C because $12 \div 3 = 4$. Correct answers are often guesses here.

**basic:**
*Targeting students working at Grade 3–4. They understand they need to divide by 3, but struggle with the mechanics of fraction division.*
**A=55% B=25% C=10% D=10%**
*Reasoning:* The "pull" of the $12 \div 3 = 4$ relationship is strongest here. They know $p$ should be smaller than $1/12$, but the common mistake is to simply divide the denominator by the integer.

**proficient:**
*Targeting students working at Grade 5–6. They recognise the need for $1/12 \div 3$, but may make a calculation slip.*
**A=20% B=65% C=5% D=10%**
*Reasoning:* Most have mastered the "Keep-Change-Flip" or multiplying the denominator. Errors usually come from rushing and picking A because it "looks" like a standard maths result.

**advanced:**
*Targeting students working at Grade 7–9. They have strong algebraic fluency.*
**A=5% B=92% C=1% D=2%**
*Reasoning:* Highly likely to get it right. Rare errors are usually "silly mistakes" (transcription errors) or misreading $3p$ as $p/3$.
