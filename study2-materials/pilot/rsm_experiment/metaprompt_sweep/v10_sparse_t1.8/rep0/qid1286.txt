In the context of the UK curriculum (GCSE Higher Tier/A-Level), this question tests the ability to recall the volume of a sphere formula and perform algebraic rearrangement (changing the subject of a formula).

Here is the prediction of student responses by ability level:

**below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%**
*   **Reasoning:** These students often cannot recall the formula correctly (confusing $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ with area formulas or simply forgetting the $3/4$ fraction). They are highly likely to pick **A** because the numbers appear in the "standard" order they associate with the formula ($4$, $\pi$, then $3$) without understanding the inverse operations required to isolate $r$.

**basic: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level likely know the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ but struggle with the multi-step rearrangement. Many will incorrectly move the fraction to the other side (picking **B** by dividing by $3$ instead of multiplying). There is a near-even split between the distractors as they guess the placement of the $3$ and $4$.

**proficient: A=10% B=15% C=65% D=10%**
*   **Reasoning:** These are Grade 6/7 GCSE students. They correctly identify that to isolate $r^3$, they must multiply by $3$ and divide by $4\pi$. The most common error here is a "slip" in algebraic manipulation (Option **B**) or failing to apply the cube root to the entire expression (Option **D**), but the majority will reach the correct inverse operation.

**advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%**
*   **Reasoning:** Grade 8/9 or A-Level students will view this as a trivial 1-mark rearrangement task. Errors would almost exclusively be down to "exam haze" or misreading the question. They instinctively look for the reciprocal of the coefficient ($3/4\pi$) before looking at the options.
