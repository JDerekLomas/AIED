Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical UK Year 9-11 (GCSE) attainment tiers.

### The Breakdown of Distractors:
*   **A (20):** Operational error. Students multiply all visible numbers ($4 \times 5 = 20$ or $10 \times 2 = 20$) without understanding the structure of the equation.
*   **B (3):** Calculation error/Inverse confusion. Substituted $x=1$ instead of $x=0$, or miscalculated $10 - 4 = 6$ then $6 \div 2 = 3$.
*   **C (5):** **The Correct Answer.** Substitution of $x=0$ leads to $2y=10$, so $y=5$.
*   **D (2.5):** Structural error. Student thinks the answer is $10 \div 4$, confusing the coefficient of $x$ with the coefficient of $y$.

### Predicted Responses

**below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%**
Students at this level often struggle with formal substitution. Many will look at the numbers present in the equation ($4, 2, 10$) and the first value in the table ($0$) and attempt a random operation. **A** is a common "blind" guess because it involves multiplication. Many will skip the question or guess **C** purely because 5 is a factor of 10.

**basic: A=15% B=20% C=45% D=20%**
These students (typically Grade 3/Target 4) understand they need to "do something" with the $x=0$. However, they often struggle with two-step equations. Some will perform $10 \div 4$ (Option **D**) or assume $x=1$ (Option **B**). **C** becomes the majority answer here, but often through trial and error rather than formal rearrangement.

**proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%**
Students at this level (Target Grade 5/6) are comfortable with substitution. The main source of error here is "exam haste"—forgetting the $2y$ and assuming $y = 10-4$. However, since $x=0$ simplifies the expression so significantly, the vast majority will correctly identify $2y=10$.

**advanced: A=0% B=2% C=98% D=0%**
For students targeting Grades 7-9, this is a "low demand" question. Errors would be strictly clerical (misreading the $x$ value). They instantly recognise $x=0$ as the y-intercept calculation and solve $10/2$ mentally.
