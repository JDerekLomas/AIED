In the UK context, student responses to this question are heavily influenced by the "BIDMAS" (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) mnemonic. 

The primary misconception is the **"Addition before Subtraction" trap**, where students believe they must add before subtracting in Problem P because A comes before S in BIDMAS, whereas mathematically they carry equal priority and should be worked left-to-right.

Here is a prediction of responses across ability levels:

**below_basic:** A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
*   **Rationale:** These students usually work purely left-to-right (Option A). They likely haven't internalised order of operations yet. Some will pick C if they have heard of BIDMAS but think Addition *must* come first regardless of the calculation.

**basic:** A=20% B=25% C=40% D=15%
*   **Rationale:** This is the peak of the BIDMAS misconception. Many students in this bracket are taught the acronym and apply it rigidly/literally. They will pick **C** for Problem P because "A comes before S" and pick **B** for Problem Q because "M comes before A." This is a very common plateau for Year 7/8 students.

**proficient:** A=25% B=55% C=10% D=10%
*   **Rationale:** These students have moved past the literal interpretation of BIDMAS. They understand that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority (working left-to-right) and that Multiplication precedes Addition. They are most likely to select the correct answer (**B**).

**advanced:** A=10% B=85% C=2% D=3%
*   **Rationale:** High-ability students recognise that $4-5+6$ is the same as $4 + (-5) + 6$ and that left-to-right is the standard convention. They rarely fall for the "Addition first" trap. The 10% for A accounts for students who overthink the question or make a "visual" error, but the vast majority will confidently select **B**.

**Teacher's Summary (The "Why"):**
The "Distractor" here is **Option C**. In the UK, we often "over-teach" the acronym BIDMAS without explaining that Addition and Subtraction are a single "tier" of priority. Consequently, the jump from "Basic" to "Proficient" is almost entirely defined by whether a student understands that Problem P should be solved left-to-right.
