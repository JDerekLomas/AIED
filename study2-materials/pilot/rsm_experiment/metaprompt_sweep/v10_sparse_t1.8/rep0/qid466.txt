Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical classroom data and common misconceptions regarding negative numbers and reciprocal operations in the UK curriculum (KS3/KS4).

**Key Misconceptions:**
*   **Sign confusion:** Students often believe two negatives make a positive (correct), but forget that to result in a *negative* answer, you need one of each sign.
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative Inverse:** Lower-ability students often confuse the "reciprocal" (for multiplication) with the "opposite" (for addition).

### Predicted Responses

**below_basic**
*These students struggle with the concept of a reciprocal and often "guess" based on the numbers they see. They likely ignore the negative sign or choose the same number thinking it "balances" the equation.*
**A=20% B=15% C=35% D=30%**

**basic**
*Students at this level know the answer involves the same digits. Many will choose D thinking that multiplying a number by itself somehow equals 1, or C because they know they need to "get rid" of the minus but don't understand the reciprocal.*
**A=25% B=20% C=40% D=15%**

**proficient**
*These students understand that to get '1', they need the reciprocal ($4/3$). However, the "double negative" rule is a high-frequency trap. They may incorrectly think: "The answer is negative, so the calculation needs a negative," failing to realise the first term is already negative.*
**A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%**

**advanced**
*These students recognise that $(-) \times (+) = (-)$. They immediately identify that $3/4 \times 4/3 = 1$, and since the negative sign is already present in the question and required in the answer, the star must be positive.*
**A=92% B=5% C=2% D=1%**
