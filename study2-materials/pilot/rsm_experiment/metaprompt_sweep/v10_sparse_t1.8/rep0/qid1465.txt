In the UK secondary mathematics curriculum (KS3/KS4), this question tests two distinct concepts: **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)** and **Directed Numbers (Arithmetic with Negatives)**.

The correct calculation is: $3 - 5 + (4 \times 2) \rightarrow 3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = \mathbf{6}$.

### **The Distractors**
*   **A (6):** The correct answer.
*   **B (4):** The "Left-to-Right" error without BIDMAS. $(3-5+4) \times 2 \rightarrow 2 \times 2 = 4$.
*   **C (-12):** BIDMAS error. Adds $5+8$ first, treating the calculation as $3 - (5+8) \rightarrow 3 - 13 = -10$. No, wait—this leads to D. Choice C is often reached by $(3-5+4) \times 2$ but with a negative sign error: $-2+4 = -2 \rightarrow -2 \times 2 = -4$, or similar messy arithmetic.
*   **D (-10):** A common "Over-BIDMAS" error. Student sees **A** (Addition) comes before **S** (Subtraction) in the acronym, so they do $5+8=13$ first, then $3-13 = -10$.

### **Predicted Responses by Ability Level**

**below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%**
Students at this level almost always work strictly left-to-right, ignoring the priority of multiplication. They are likely to get $3-5 = -2$, then add $4$ to get $2$, then multiply by $2$ to get **B (4)**. Some will struggle with the negative number and default to choice D because "Add comes before Subtract" in their memorized acronym.

**basic: A=35% B=20% C=10% D=35%**
These students remember BIDMAS exists but misapply it. The most common pitfall here is Choice **D**. Because **A** precedes **S** in BIDMAS, they perform the addition part of the expression $(5 + 8)$ before subtracting it from 3. This is the classic "Acronym Trap."

**proficient: A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%**
Proficient students know multiplication comes first. Most will handle $3 - 5 + 8$ correctly. The remaining 15% error rate is almost entirely attributed to those who still fall for the "Addition before Subtraction" trap, which is a persistent misconception even into higher GCSE tiers.

**advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%**
Advanced students (targeting Grade 7-9) recognise that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and are worked left-to-right, or they treat the expression as $3 + (-5) + 8$. Errors here are extremely rare "finger slips" or reading the $\times$ as a $+$.
