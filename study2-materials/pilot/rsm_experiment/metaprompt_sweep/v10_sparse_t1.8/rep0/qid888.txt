Here is the predicted response data based on typical misconceptions observed in UK secondary classrooms (Year 9–11) for this specific quadratic expansion.

**Context of Errors:**
*   **A:** Calculation error with directed numbers ($-7 + 5$ or $-7 - (-5)$ instead of $-7 - 5$).
*   **B:** The correct answer.
*   **C:** Sign error (ignoring the negative signs and treating everything as addition).
*   **D:** Multiplication error (negative $\times$ negative = negative misconception).

**below_basic:** 
A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%  
*Rationale: Students at this level often struggle significantly with directed numbers. A large portion will pick **C** because they ignore the minus signs entirely. Others will guess between A and D based on faulty subtraction or multiplication rules.*

**basic:** 
A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%  
*Rationale: Most students at this level know how to "FOIL" or use a grid, but **D** is a very common trap. They correctly sum $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$, but then incorrectly calculate $-5 \times -7$ as $-35$.*

**proficient:** 
A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%  
*Rationale: GCSE Foundation students at Grade 4/5 or Higher students at Grade 6 usually have the method secure. The most likely error remains the sign for the constant term (Option D).*

**advanced:** 
A=1% B=98% C=0% D=1%  
*Rationale: These students (Grade 7+) see this as a "fluency" task. Errors are extremely rare and are usually the result of rushing/losing focus rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.*
