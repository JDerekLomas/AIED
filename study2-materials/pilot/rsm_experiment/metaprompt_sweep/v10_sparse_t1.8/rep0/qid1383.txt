As a UK maths teacher, I would expect the common misconceptions to centre around two areas: **order of operations** (index before multiplication) and the **rules for multiplying negative numbers**.

The specific challenge here is how students handle $(-3)^4$. Students who use a non-scientific calculator incorrectly (typing $-3^4$ without brackets) will get $-81$, reinforcing the misconception in Option C.

Here is the predicted distribution based on UK Key Stage 3/4 ability levels:

**below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%**
*   **The Logic:** At this level, many students do not understand index notation as repeated multiplication. They are highly likely to do $3 \times 4 = 12$. Because there is a negative sign, they will fluctuate between B and D based on whether they think "a negative makes the whole thing negative."

**basic: A=35% B=10% C=45% D=10%**
*   **The Logic:** These students understand that $k^4$ means $k \times k \times k \times k$. However, they struggle with the "even power rule." They will calculate $3^4 = 81$ correctly but instinctively assume that because the input is negative, the output must remain negative. This is the most common "working" error in the foundation tier.

**proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%**
*   **The Logic:** These students (typically Grade 5/6) know that a negative number raised to an even power yields a positive result. However, some will still fall into the calculator trap or "sign-error" trap under pressure, leading them to C.

**advanced: A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%**
*   **The Logic:** At this level (Grade 7-9/A-level), students have internalised that $(-k)^{even} = positive$. Errors here are almost exclusively "slips" rather than lack of knowledge.
