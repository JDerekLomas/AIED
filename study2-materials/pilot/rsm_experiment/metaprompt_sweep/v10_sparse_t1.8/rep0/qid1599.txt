As a UK maths teacher, I would expect to see the following distribution. The "Working Towards" (Below Basic) group often struggles with the horizontal fraction bar acting as a grouping symbol (bracket), whereas the "Greater Depth" (Advanced) group typically treats this as a one-mark "check" question.

**Key misconceptions:**
*   **B:** Miscopying the numerator (confusing the '+4' with 'c').
*   **C:** Operational order error; dividing $c$ by $h$ first and then adding 4 (BIDMAS error).
*   **D:** "Reverse division" – putting the larger/longer expression on top because it "looks" more like a fraction.

**below_basic:** A=40% B=15% C=25% D=20%
*(Many will choose A by chance, but C is a very common distractor here as they process the $c \div h$ first.)*

**basic:** A=65% B=5% C=15% D=15%
*(Confidence in algebraic notation is growing, but they still occasionally swap the numerator and denominator.)*

**proficient:** A=88% B=2% C=5% D=5%
*(The majority have mastered that the vinclum replaces the division sign and covers the entire bracketed expression.)*

**advanced:** A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
*(Almost all students at this level recognize the standard notation immediately; errors are usually due to rushing.)*
