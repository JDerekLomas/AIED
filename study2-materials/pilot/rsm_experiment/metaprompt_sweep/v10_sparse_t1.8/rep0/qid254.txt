As a UK maths teacher, I would expect the primary pitfalls here to be the **treatment of zero** (whether it "counts" as a value) and **order of operations (BIDMAS)** when using a calculator or writing an expression.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

**below_basic:** 
A=25% B=45% C=25% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** Many students at this level believe the mean is simply "adding up the numbers and dividing." Option B looks like a literal translation of that sentence. Those who remember "divide by how many numbers there are" are split between A (counting the zero) and C (ignoring the zero).

**basic:**
A=40% B=25% C=30% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** At this level, students know they must divide by 5. Option A looks correct because the '0' isn't explicitly written in the numerator (and they know 0 doesn't change the sum). However, a significant portion will still choose C because they have a misconception that 0 "doesn't count" as a data point. B remains a distractor for those who don't consider the need for brackets.

**proficient:**
A=75% B=10% C=10% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** These students understand that 0 is a value that must be included in the count ($n=5$), and they recognize that $\frac{15}{5}$ is the same as $\frac{0+15}{5}$. They are more wary of Option B because they have been cautioned about BIDMAS/calculator errors, identifying that $7 \div 5$ would be calculated first in that string.

**advanced:**
A=92% B=2% C=1% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** These students instantly identify that Option A is mathematically identical to $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$. They will notice that B is incorrect due to the lack of brackets. A small percentage might overthink it and choose D, arguing that the 0 *must* be explicitly written in the numerator to be "completely" correct, but most will correctly identify A as the valid calculation.

**Summary Table:**

| Level | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **below_basic** | 25% | 45% | 25% | 5% |
| **basic** | 40% | 25% | 30% | 5% |
| **proficient** | 75% | 10% | 10% | 5% |
| **advanced** | 92% | 2% | 1% | 5% |
