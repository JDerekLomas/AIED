Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on typical misconceptions encountered in UK secondary mathematics (Key Stage 3 and GCSE).

**The Correct Answer is A.**

### Predicted Responses

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Misconception) | C (Misconception) | D (Misconception) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 35% | 10% | 40% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 15% | 10% | 30% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 5% | 2% | 8% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0% | 1% |

### Teacher’s Analysis of Misconceptions

*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$): The most common error.**
    Students at the **Basic** and **Below Basic** levels often spot the "common denominator" of $2x$ but forget to adjust the numerator of the second fraction. They simply add the top numbers ($3+4=7$) and keep the larger denominator.
*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$): "Add across."**
    Students at the **Below Basic** level treat algebraic fractions like they often (erroneously) treat numerical ones: by adding the numerators ($3+4$) and adding the denominators ($2x + x$).
*   **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$): Misplaced Factor.**
    Some **Basic/Proficient** students correctly identify that they need to multiply the second fraction by 2 to get $8/2x$, but when they add them, they inadvertently "cancel" or lose the 2 from the denominator in their final step.
*   **Option A ($\frac{11}{2x}$): Correct Logic.**
    Requires the student to recognize the LCD is $2x$, find the equivalent fraction $\frac{8}{2x}$, and sum the numerators. **Proficient** students (GCSE Grade 5+) usually handle this confidently, while **Advanced** students (Grade 7+) will see this as a trivial "starting" question.
