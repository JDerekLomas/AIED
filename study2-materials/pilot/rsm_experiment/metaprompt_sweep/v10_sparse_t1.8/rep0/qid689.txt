As a UK maths teacher, this specific question is a classic "diagnostic" trap. It tests whether students understand the structure of an algebraic equation versus a simple operation. Many students see the numbers 10 and 5 and perform $10 \div 5$ without considering the position of the variable $p$.

Here is the predicted breakdown of responses by ability level (expressed as percentages):

### **Predicted Student Responses**

| Ability Level | A ($p=0.5$) | B ($p=50$) | C ($p=2$) | D (None) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 35% | 50% | 5% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 15% | 55% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 75% | 5% | 18% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 1% | 0% |

### **Teacher’s Commentary / Error Analysis**

*   **Option C ($p=2$): The Most Common Distractor.**
    This is the "reflex" answer. **Below Basic** and **Basic** students often ignore the equals sign and the fraction structure, simply performing the division $10 \div 5$. They associate the equals sign with "calculate the answer" rather than "maintain balance."
*   **Option B ($p=50$): The Inverse Error.**
    Common among **Below Basic** students who know that "to move something you do the opposite," but they apply it incorrectly by multiplying $10 \times 5$, thinking they are "clearing the fraction" without understanding that $p$ is in the denominator.
*   **Option A ($p=0.5$): The Correct Answer.**
    To get this right, a student must either:
    1.  Algebraically multiply by $p$ and then divide by 10 ($10p = 5 \implies p = 5/10$).
    2.  Logically deduce that for the result to be larger than the numerator, the denominator must be a proper fraction.
    **Proficient** students have moved past the "reflex" phase and follow a set of steps (Cross-multiplying or "Swapping").
*   **Option D (There are no solutions):**
    Usually a "panic" choice for lower-ability students who feel that "5 can't be divided to make 10," thinking of division only as "sharing" (which usually results in a smaller number).

**Teaching Tip:** For those choosing C, I would ask: *"If $p=2$, what is 5 divided by 2?"* Realising the answer is 2.5 usually forces them to reconsider the structure of the equation.
