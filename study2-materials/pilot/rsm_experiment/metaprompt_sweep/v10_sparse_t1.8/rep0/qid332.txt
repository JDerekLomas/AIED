In the UK secondary curriculum (Key Stage 3/4), this question tests the understanding of **inverse operations** and the **order of operations** when solving linear equations.

The core misconception being tested is whether students understand that to multiply by 3 (Katie's method), they must multiply *every* term in the equation, not just the fraction and the result.

### Analysis of Methods:
*   **Tom is correct:** He added 5 to both sides. $12 + 5 = 17$. This is the standard "balance" method.
*   **Katie is incorrect:** She tried to multiply by 3 but failed to multiply the $-5$ term. A correct version of her step would be $x - 15 = 36$.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic (Working towards Grade 2)**
*   **A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%**
*   **Rationale:** Students at this level often struggle with the "balance" concept. Many will see Katie’s "36" ($12 \times 3$) and assume it's correct because they recognise that multiplication is the inverse of division. A significant portion will guess C (Both) because "maths problems in tests usually have multiple ways to solve them."

**basic (Grade 3/4)**
*   **A=55% B=15% C=25% D=5%**
*   **Rationale:** These students are becoming more confident with the $+5$ step, so Tom will be identified as correct by most. However, many still fall for the "Katie trap" because they don't yet realise that a multiplier must be applied to the entire side of an equation.

**proficient (Grade 5/6)**
*   **A=80% B=5% C=12% D=3%**
*   **Rationale:** Most proficient students will correctly identify Tom’s step as the standard first move. They are less likely to fall for Katie's mistake, although a small number might still be swayed by the "looks right" logic of $x - 5 = 36$ if they are rushing and not checking the middle term.

**advanced (Grade 7+)**
*   **A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%**
*   **Rationale:** Advanced students will immediately spot that Katie failed to distribute the multiplication across the constant term. They will confidently select A. The negligible error rate accounts for occasional misreads of the question.
