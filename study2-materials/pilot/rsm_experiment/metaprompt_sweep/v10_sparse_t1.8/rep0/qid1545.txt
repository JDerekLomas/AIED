In the UK context, this question primarily tests **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction).

The calculation breaks down as:
*   **Left Side:** $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$
*   **Right Side:** $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$
*   **Comparison:** $11 > 5$. Therefore, the answer is **A**.

Here is the prediction of student responses by ability level:

**below_basic:** 
*   **A=15% B=20% C=60% D=5%**
*   *Reasoning:* These students rarely apply BIDMAS. They will likely calculate the left side from left-to-right $(8+12=20; 20 \div 4 = 5)$. Since both sides then result in 5, they will overwhelmingly choose **C (=)**.

**basic:**
*   **A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%**
*   *Reasoning:* These students have heard of BIDMAS but apply it inconsistently. Many will still perform the left-to-right calculation and pick **C**. Others might correctly calculate one side but guess the inequality direction.

**proficient:**
*   **A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%**
*   *Reasoning:* Students at this level (typically target Grade 4/5) know to divide before adding on the left. The most common error here isn't a lack of knowledge, but "cognitive ease"—briefly forgetting BIDMAS on the left while being prompted by the brackets on the right.

**advanced:**
*   **A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%**
*   *Reasoning:* These students (targeting Grade 7+) will instantly recognise this as a BIDMAS trap. They will perform the mental arithmetic $11$ vs $5$ almost instantaneously. Any errors would be purely "fatigue" slips.
