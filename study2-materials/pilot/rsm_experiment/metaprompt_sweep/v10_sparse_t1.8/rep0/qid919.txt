In a UK secondary school context (Key Stage 3 or GCSE), this question tests three distinct skills: substitution, order of operations (BIDMAS), and calculation with decimals.

The most common "distractor" here is misapplying the power of 2 to the product $(3x)^2$ rather than just the $x^2$.

### **Predicted Student Responses**

**below_basic (Working at Grade 1-2 / Lower KS3)**
*Students at this level often ignore the index/power or perform the multiplication first. Many struggle with squaring decimals.*
* **A (0.81):** $15\%$ — Square both numbers $(3^2 \times 0.3^2 = 9 \times 0.09)$.
* **B (0.27):** $10\%$ — Correct answer, often reached by luck or partial understanding.
* **C (1.8):** $40\%$ — The "Linear mistake": $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$. They treat $x^2$ as $2x$.
* **D (2.7):** $35\%$ — Square the 3 and multiply by 0.3, or misplace the decimal point in $0.3 \times 0.3$.

**basic (Working at Grade 3-4 / Foundation GCSE)**
*Students understand $x^2$ means $x \times x$, but frequently violate BIDMAS by multiplying $3 \times 0.3$ before squaring.*
* **A (0.81):** $45\%$ — The "BIDMAS trap": $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$.
* **B (0.27):** $25\%$ — Starting to apply BIDMAS correctly but prone to calculation errors.
* **C (1.8):** $15\%$ — Still some confusion between squaring and doubling.
* **D (2.7):** $15\%$ — Decimal place errors $(3 \times 0.9 = 2.7)$.

**proficient (Working at Grade 5-6 / Higher GCSE)**
*Students generally know BIDMAS, but decimals remain a significant friction point.*
* **A (0.81):** $20\%$ — Careful students avoid this; rushed students fall into the trap.
* **B (0.27):** $65\%$ — Most understand $3 \times (0.3 \times 0.3)$.
* **C (1.8):** $5\%$ — Rare at this level.
* **D (2.7):** $10\%$ — Miscalculating $0.3 \times 0.3$ as $0.9$.

**advanced (Working at Grade 7-9)**
*Students have mastered BIDMAS and are fluent in decimal/fraction conversions.*
* **A (0.81):** $2\%$ — Only through extreme carelessness.
* **B (0.27):** $95\%$ — Systematic application of $3(0.09) = 0.27$.
* **C (1.8):** $1\%$ — Negligible.
* **D (2.7):** $2\%$ — Occasional decimal slip.

| Ability Level | A (0.81) | B (0.27) | C (1.8) | D (2.7) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **below_basic** | 15% | 10% | 40% | 35% |
| **basic** | 45% | 25% | 15% | 15% |
| **proficient** | 20% | 65% | 5% | 10% |
| **advanced** | 2% | 95% | 1% | 2% |

**Teacher's Note:** Option **A** is the most powerful distractor for middle-ability students because it rewards a "left-to-right" calculation approach ($3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, then $0.9^2 = 0.81$). Option **D** is the most common error for those who know they should square first but calculate $0.3^2$ as $0.9$ instead of $0.09$.
