In the context of the UK curriculum (GCSE Year 9-11), this question specifically tests two potential misconceptions: **Directed Numbers** (Negative $\times$ Negative) and **Operation Identification** (adding the terms instead of multiplying them).

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level:

### **Predicted Student Responses**

| Ability Level | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 20% | 25% | 40% |
| **Basic** | 35% | 20% | 5% | 40% |
| **Proficient** | 75% | 20% | 0% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 2% | 0% | 0% |

### **Teacher Insight & Analysis**

#### **Below Basic (Foundation Tier - Grade 1-2)**
*   **Analysis:** These students often struggle with the "wordiness" of the instruction. They see a $-1$ and a $-4$ and intuitively **add** them (mental "combining") rather than multiply, leading them to $-5$. 
*   **Most Common Error:** **D**. They ignore the word "multiplies" in favor of the signs they see.

#### **Basic (Foundation Tier - Grade 3-4)**
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level understand that expanding brackets involves multiplication. However, their grasp of directed numbers is shaky. Many will calculate $1 \times 4 = 4$ but then "bring the minus down" or conclude that a negative and a negative must stay negative.
*   **Most Common Error:** **B** (Sign error) or **D** (Addition error). This group is split between those who multiply and those who add.

#### **Proficient (Higher Tier - Grade 5-7)**
*   **Analysis:** These students are fluent in the FOIL or Grid method. They know that multiplication is required. The most likely error here is a "slip of the pen" regarding the negative sign rules, but most will correctly identify that two negatives make a positive.
*   **Most Common Error:** **B**. Usually caused by rushing and not checking the signs carefully.

#### **Advanced (Higher Tier - Grade 8-9)**
*   **Analysis:** This is a "buffer" question for advanced students. They will correctly identify the constants and the signs immediately. 
*   **Predictable Result:** **A**. They are highly unlikely to select C or D. A tiny percentage might misread the question as $2p \times 3p$ if they aren't looking at the image, but with the arrows provided, errors will be negligible.
