As a UK maths teacher, I see this specific question frequently in GCSE Higher and Foundation tiers. It tests the ability to find a common denominator involving algebraic terms.

### Step 1 — Analysis of Reasoning

**A) Correct reasoning.**
The student identifies the Lowest Common Multiple of the denominators $2x$ and $x$ as $2x$. They correctly adjust the second fraction: $\frac{4}{x} = \frac{8}{2x}$. They then add the numerators ($3 + 8 = 11$) while keeping the denominator constant.

**B) "Add everything" misconception.**
The student adds the numerators ($3 + 4 = 7$) and adds the denominators ($2x + x = 3x$). This is a very common error among students who treat fractions as two independent sets of integers rather than parts of a whole.

**C) Incomplete common denominator / Multiplying numerator only.**
The student realizes they need a common denominator and chooses $x$, but they perform $\frac{3}{2} + 4 = 11$ and place it over $x$, or they mistakenly double the 4 to get 8 but forget the $2$ stays in the denominator for the first term, leading to an inconsistent result. Alternatively, they might find the numerator $11$ correctly but think the $2$ "cancels out" or is redundant.

**D) Numerator-only addition.**
The student correctly identifies that $2x$ should be the denominator (perhaps because it is the "larger" looking one), but they forget to scale the second numerator. They simply do $3 + 4 = 7$ over $2x$.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, **"Below Basic"** corresponds to low-attaining Foundation students; **"Basic"** to mid-Foundation; **"Proficient"** to borderline Grade 4/5 (Pass); and **"Advanced"** to Grade 7-9 (Higher) students.

**below_basic:** A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
*Reasoning: High tendency to add straight across (B) or simply pick the most common denominator without adjusting numerators (D).*

**basic:** A=40% B=25% C=10% D=25%
*Reasoning: Students start to recognize common denominators, but "forgetting to multiply the top" (D) remains a significant hurdle.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
*Reasoning: Most students at this level have mastered the algorithm for fractions, though "silly mistakes" regarding the $2x$ scaling (D) still occur under exam pressure.*

**advanced:** A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
*Reasoning: Advanced students at GCSE/A-Level see this as a trivial "one-marker" and rarely make the procedural errors found in B or D.*
