As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen this specific topic (index notation and negative substitution) trip up many students. The common pitfalls usually involve the "sign" of the result and a confusion between exponents and multiplication.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) 81 (Correct):** The student correctly understands that $(-3)^4 = (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$. They know that a negative number raised to an even power results in a positive product (or they calculated step-by-step: $9 \times 9 = 81$).
*   **B) 12 (Multiplication Error):** The student has misinterpreted the index notation as simple multiplication ($k \times 4$). They have calculated $(-3) \times 4$ but either ignored the negative sign or assumed powers must result in positive values.
*   **C) -81 (Sign Error):** This is the most common error among intermediate students. The student knows $3^4 = 81$ but incorrectly assumes that if the base is negative, the answer must be negative. Alternatively, they may have used a scientific calculator incorrectly by typing $-3^4$ without brackets, which the calculator processes as $-(3^4)$.
*   **D) -12 (Double Error):** The student has multiplied the base by the index ($ -3 \times 4 $) and correctly applied the rule for multiplying a negative by a positive. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of exponents.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions:

I have categorised "ability levels" based on the typical UK GCSE performance (Grades 1-9).

*   **Below Basic (Working at Grades 1-2):** These students often struggle with the definition of a power.
    **A=15% B=35% C=10% D=40%**
*   **Basic (Working at Grades 3-4):** These students understand that powers mean "repeated multiplication" but are very likely to make the "negative sign" mistake or forget that even powers turn positive.
    **A=30% B=15% C=40% D=15%**
*   **Proficient (Working at Grades 5-6):** These students are solid on index notation but are frequently caught out by the $(-3)^4$ vs $-3^4$ calculator logic.
    **A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%**
*   **Advanced (Working at Grades 7-9):** These students have mastered the rules of directed numbers and even/odd powers.
    **A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%**

**Teacher's Note:** Option **C** is a notorious "distractor." Even high-achieving students can fall for it under exam pressure if they are over-reliant on a calculator and don't physically write the brackets around the $-3$.
