As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific question as a classic test of a student’s understanding of the **Order of Operations (BIDMAS)** combined with their proficiency in **decimal multiplication**. The squaring of a decimal smaller than 1 is a notorious "trap" for students across the ability spectrum.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) 0.81:** This results from a "Left-to-Right" calculation error, ignoring BIDMAS. The student multiplies 3 by 0.3 first to get 0.9, and then squares 0.9 $(0.9^2 = 0.81)$. This is a very common procedural error.
*   **B) 0.27:** **(The Correct Answer)** The student correctly applies BIDMAS, squaring $0.3$ first $(0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09)$ and then multiplying by $3$ $(3 \times 0.09 = 0.27)$.
*   **C) 1.8:** This results from a misunderstanding of the exponent. The student interprets $3x^2$ as $3 \times (x \times 2)$. They calculate $0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$, and then $3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$.
*   **D) 2.7:** This stems from a decimal placement error during the squaring phase. The student knows to square first, but calculates $0.3^2$ as $0.9$ (forgetting that $0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01$). Then, $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions:

In the UK curriculum, "Below Basic" refers to students working significantly below age-related expectations (KS3 level 3/4), "Basic" refers to a standard Foundation GCSE student (Grade 3), "Proficient" refers to a Higher Tier student (Grade 5/6), and "Advanced" refers to top-set students (Grade 8/9).

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the notation $x^2$, frequently treating it as $\times 2$.
    *   **A=25% B=15% C=50% D=10%**
*   **Basic:** These students usually know what $x^2$ means but almost always perform calculations from left to right if a formula is presented this way, and they struggle with multiplying decimals.
    *   **A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%**
*   **Proficient:** These students understand BIDMAS but are highly susceptible to the "decimal trap" ($0.3^2 = 0.9$ instead of $0.09$).
    *   **A=15% B=50% C=5% D=30%**
*   **Advanced:** These students have mastered both the order of operations and the place value logic required for decimal squares.
    *   **A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%**
