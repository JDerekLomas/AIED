As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen hundreds of students tackle quadratic expansion. The difficulty here lies entirely in the manipulation of directed numbers (negative signs), rather than the algebraic process itself.

### Step 1 — Analysis of Reasoning

**A) $m^{2}-2m-35$**
*   **Reasoning:** The student has correctly identified the $m^2$ term but has confused the rules for adding/subtracting negatives with the rules for multiplying them. They have calculated $-5 + 7 = +2$ or similar, or more likely, they have subtracted the numbers ($7-5=2$) and then used a negative sign for the constant term because they see negatives in the bracket. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the FOIL/Grid method's final steps.

**B) $m^{2}-12m+35$**
*   **Reasoning:** **Correct.** The student has correctly expanded and simplified: $m \times m = m^2$; $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$; and the middle term $-5m - 7m = -12m$. They have correctly applied the rule that "a negative times a negative is a positive."

**C) $m^{2}+12m+35$**
*   **Reasoning:** The student knows that $5+7=12$ and $5 \times 7=35$, and they know that "two negatives make a plus." However, they have over-applied this rule to the linear term as well as the constant term. They lack the conceptual understanding that they are adding two negative debts together to get a larger negative debt $(-5 - 7 = -12)$.

**D) $m^{2}-12m-35$**
*   **Reasoning:** This is a very common "partial proficiency" error. The student correctly calculates the middle term $(-12m)$ but fails on the final multiplication. They see the negative signs in $(m-5)$ and $(m-7)$ and instinctively think the answer must remain negative, or they simply calculate $5 \times 7$ and "bring down" one of the minus signs.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system (KS4/GCSE), "Below Basic" corresponds to Foundation Tier students struggling with Grade 3; "Proficient" corresponds to Higher Tier students aiming for Grade 6/7; "Advanced" refers to Grade 8/9 students.

**below_basic:** A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%
*(These students often guess or follow the "everything is negative" logic in Option D. Very few will correctly navigate the double negative in the multiplication.)*

**basic:** A=15% B=40% C=20% D=25%
*(At this level, students start to use the grid method or FOIL, but roughly half will still make a sign error on the constant term (-35) or the middle term (+12m).)*

**proficient:** A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
*(Most proficient students have mastered the directed number rules. The most likely error remains Option D, usually due to a momentary lapse in concentration when multiplying the constants.)*

**advanced:** A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%
*(At this level, the expansion of a double-negative bracket is second nature. Any errors are usually "slips" rather than misconceptions.)*
