As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen students struggle with the order of inverse operations, particularly when a numerator contains a sum. Here is an analysis of Isaac's work on the equation \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\).

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

*   **A) Only step 1:** This is the **correct reasoning**. Isaac correctly multiplied both sides by 4 to clear the denominator (\(15 \times 4 = 60\)), leaving \(1+k\). However, in Step 2, he made a common sign error (adding 1 to 60 instead of subtracting it), identifying that only the first step was mathematically sound.
*   **B) Only step 2:** This reasoning suggests the student doesn't understand the first step (perhaps thinking the 4 should have been subtracted or added) but incorrectly believes that \(61 = k\) follows logically from the original structure, or they have fundamentally misunderstood how to isolate \(k\).
*   **C) Both steps are correct:** This is a very common **misconception**. The student recognises that Step 1 is correct (\(15 \times 4 = 60\)). However, they then follow Isaac’s "intuitive" error in Step 2: seeing a \(1\) and a \(60\) and simply combining them to make \(61\), forgetting that the inverse of adding 1 is subtracting 1.
*   **D) Both steps are incorrect:** This reasoning usually comes from students who believe the \(+1\) must be dealt with before the division by \(4\). They might think Step 1 is wrong because Isaac didn't subtract 1 first, leading them to reject the entire process.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK curriculum, this aligns with KS3 (Year 8/9) or Foundation GCSE level algebra.

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the "multi-step" nature and will likely choose C because the numbers "look" right (60 and 61 follow a sequence) or D because they are overwhelmed by the fraction.
*   **Basic:** Many students at this level can perform the first inverse operation but succumb to the "change side, change sign" error or simply add because they see a plus sign, making C the most popular choice.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually spot that Step 1 is the standard first move but have the self-correction skills to notice that \(60 = 1 + k\) should lead to \(k = 59\).
*   **Advanced:** These students will immediately see the error in Step 2 and confidently select A.
