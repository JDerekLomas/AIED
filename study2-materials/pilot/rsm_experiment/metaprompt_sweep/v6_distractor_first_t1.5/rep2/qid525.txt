As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen these specific misconceptions play out frequently in both Key Stage 3 and GCSE foundation classrooms. Adding mixed numbers requires a multi-step process, and students often "drop out" or take shortcuts at different stages.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

**A) \( \frac{99}{20} \)**
The student has performed the calculation correctly, likely by converting to improper fractions (\(\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}\)). However, they failed to read the final part of the instruction: "Leave your answer as a mixed number." They have provided the correct value but in the wrong format.

**B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \) [CORRECT]**
The student correctly identified a common denominator (20). They added the whole numbers (\(2+2=4\)) and the fractions (\(\frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20}\)) separately, or converted and then back-converted correctly.

**C) \( \frac{99}{40} \)**
This student has a fundamental misunderstanding of fractions. They likely converted to improper fractions (\(\frac{27}{10}\) and \(\frac{9}{4}\)) but then added both the numerators and the denominators (\(27+72\) and \(10 \times 4\)) or attempted to cross-multiply but placed the product over the product of the denominators without finding a common denominator for the sum.

**D) \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \)**
This represents the most common "Low Ability" error: adding across. The student adds the whole numbers (\(2+2=4\)), then adds the numerators (\(7+1=8\)), and finally adds the denominators (\(10+4=14\)). It demonstrates a lack of understanding that fractions must represent parts of the same sized whole.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

*   **Below Basic:** These students almost universally apply "add across" logic or pick answers that look like the original numbers.
*   **Basic:** These students know they need a common denominator but often forget to convert the numerators accordingly or fall into the "improper fraction" trap and fail to convert back.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually get the maths right but are prone to "answer format" errors, missing the instruction to leave it as a mixed number.
*   **Advanced:** These students follow all instructions, including the final formatting.

| Ability Level | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **below_basic** | 10% | 15% | 25% | 50% |
| **basic** | 20% | 45% | 10% | 25% |
| **proficient** | 25% | 65% | 5% | 5% |
| **advanced** | 5% | 94% | 1% | 0% |

**Teacher's Note:** The high percentage for Option A in the "Proficient" category is a common frustration in UK exams (like Edexcel or AQA), where students lose marks on "Quality of Written Communication" or "Accuracy" by not following formatting constraints despite having high algebraic/arithmetic skill.
