As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this question as a test of two distinct skills: recall of the sphere volume formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) and the algebraic proficiency required to rearrange a subject involving fractions, pi, and powers.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

*   **A) $\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}}$:** This error usually stems from a misunderstanding of how to "move" terms across the equals sign. The student knows $\pi$ and $4$ are multipliers, but instead of dividing by them, they keep them in the numerator. They effectively see $V$ and $\frac{4}{3}\pi$ as things to be combined rather than balanced.
*   **B) $\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}}$:** This is a partial rearrangement error. The student correctly identifies that they need to divide by $\pi$, but they have failed to correctly invert the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ (multiplied by 4 instead of 3).
*   **C) $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}}$:** **Correct reasoning.** The student starts with $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. They multiply by $3$ ($3V = 4\pi r^3$), divide by $4\pi$ ($\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$), and then take the cube root of the entire expression.
*   **D) $\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi}$:** This represents a "fragmented" rearrangement. The student knows the components ($3, 4, \pi, \sqrt[3]{}$) but doesn't understand that the cube root must apply to the entire expression. They may have attempted to "square root" or "cube root" only the $V$ and then simply attached the coefficients as they appear in the original formula.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK curriculum, this is typically a Higher Tier GCSE topic (Grade 5/6).

**Below Basic (Grade 1–3):** These students often struggle to recall the formula or handle the cube root notation. They are likely to guess based on which "looks" most like the formula they vaguely remember.
**Basic (Grade 4–5):** These students know the formula but often make a "one-step" error in the rearrangement, usually regarding the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$.
**Proficient (Grade 6–7):** These students are comfortable with the formula and the concept of inverse operations but may occasionally slip up on the order of operations.
**Advanced (Grade 8–9):** These students see the rearrangement as a fluid process and rarely make errors with the radical sign's reach.

| Ability Level | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 30% | 25% | 15% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 20% | 30% | 35% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 10% | 15% | 70% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 3% | 94% | 1% |

**Teacher's Note:** Option B is a very strong "distractor" for middle-ability students because they often struggle with the rule that "dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal." They see the 4 on top in the original formula and assume it stays on top in the result.
