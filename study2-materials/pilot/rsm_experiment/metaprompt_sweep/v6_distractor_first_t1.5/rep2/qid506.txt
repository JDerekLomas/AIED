As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in GCSE Foundation and higher-tier starter sets. It tests the ability to manipulate fractions and apply the inverse operation of multiplication ($\div 3$) correctly.

### Step 1 — Analysis of Reasoning

**A) $p = \frac{1}{4}$**
**Reasoning:** This is a very common "visual" error. Students see the numbers 3 and 12 and instinctively perform $12 \div 3$ to get 4. Because the original constant was a fraction, they keep their answer as a fraction ($1/4$). They are applying the inverse operation to the denominator only, while ignoring the numerator.

**B) $p = \frac{1}{36}$**
**Reasoning: [Correct]** To solve for $p$, one must divide both sides by 3. Dividing a fraction by a whole number is equivalent to multiplying the denominator by that number: $\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$.

**C) $p = 4$**
**Reasoning:** This represents a complete breakdown of algebraic rules. The student treats the equation as $12/3 = p$ or simply ignores the fraction bar entirely, performing $12 \div 3$ and placing it as a whole number. This is often a "gut instinct" guess by students who struggle with the concept of values smaller than one.

**D) $p = \frac{1}{9}$**
**Reasoning:** This is a "subtraction" error. The student sees the 3 and the 12 and incorrectly thinks the relationship is additive or subtractive ($12 - 3 = 9$), then places it back into the denominator. Alternatively, it can be a calculation slip where a student thinks $3 \times 3 = 9$ (confusing squaring with the actual coefficients).

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, **Below Basic** corresponds to students working towards Grade 1-2; **Basic** to Grade 3; **Proficient** to Grade 4-5 (the "C" boundary); and **Advanced** to Grade 7+.

**below_basic:** A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
*Reasoning: These students are likely to guess whole numbers (C) or follow the visual pattern of the numbers 3 and 12 leading to 4 (A).*

**basic:** A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
*Reasoning: Many students at this level understand they need to do $12 \div 3$ but lack the fractional fluency to realise that dividing by 3 makes the denominator larger, making A the most seductive "distractor" for this group.*

**proficient:** A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
*Reasoning: Students here have practiced "cross-multiplying" or "dividing fractions" and will mostly recognise the need to multiply $12 \times 3$, though some will still fall for the visual trap of A if they are rushing.*

**advanced:** A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
*Reasoning: Advanced students (Grade 7+) rarely miss this, though a tiny percentage might make a "finger-slip" calculation error or misread the question.*
