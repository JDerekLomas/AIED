As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently in Foundation Tier GCSE papers. It tests the ability to substitute values into a linear equation where the variable is not already the "subject" of the formula ($y = mx + c$).

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

*   **A) 20:** The student ignores the variables and operations provided and performs $4 \times 5 = 20$, likely influenced by seeing "4" in the equation and "5" being a common factor of 10. Alternatively, they might substitute $x=0$ correctly to get $2y=10$ but then multiply by 2 instead of dividing.
*   **B) 3:** This is a "guess" or a systematic error where students confuse the coefficient of $x$ (4) and the constant (10) and somehow subtract 1 and 2 sequentially, or it is a random selection for students who find the implicit $2y$ confusing.
*   **C) 5:** **(Correct Reasoning)** The student substitutes $x = 0$ into the equation: $4(0) + 2y = 10$. This simplifies to $2y = 10$. They then divide by 2 to find $y = 5$.
*   **D) 2.5:** The student mistakenly divides the total (10) by the coefficient of $x$ (4) instead of $y$. They likely think the star represents $x$ when $y=0$, or they simply divide the two numbers they see most clearly ($10 \div 4 = 2.5$).

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK system, **below_basic** refers to students working at Grades 1-2, **basic** to Grade 3, **proficient** to Grades 4-5 (Standard/Strong Pass), and **advanced** to Grades 6+.

**below_basic:** A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
*Reasoning: High degree of guessing. Many will see the 10 and 4 and reach for 2.5, or perform an operation like $10 \times 2$ to get 20. Only a few will navigate the two-step process to find 5.*

**basic:** A=15% B=15% C=45% D=25%
*Reasoning: Students start to understand substitution but often struggle with the "2y" part. They may correctly get to $2y=10$ but then perform the wrong final operation, or confuse the $x$ and $y$ coefficients.*

**proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
*Reasoning: Most students at this level can handle $x=0$ confidently. Errors usually occur through rushing (D) rather than a lack of understanding.*

**advanced:** A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%
*Reasoning: Substitution into linear equations is a fundamental skill at this level. Mistakes are almost exclusively "slip of the pen" errors.*
