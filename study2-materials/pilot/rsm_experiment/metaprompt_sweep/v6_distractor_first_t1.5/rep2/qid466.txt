As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently when testing students' understanding of **multiplicative inverses** and **integer operations**.

### Step 1 — Analysis of Reasoning

*   **A) Correct reasoning.** To get a product of 1, you multiply by the reciprocal ($\frac{4}{3}$). Since the target is $-1$ and the starting number is already negative, the multiplier must be positive because a $negative \times positive = negative$.
*   **B) Misconception of signs.** The student correctly identifies the need for a reciprocal to turn $\frac{3}{4}$ into $1$, but they are over-applying the "negative result means negative number" rule. They fail to realize that two negatives make a positive, which would result in $+1$ instead of $-1$.
*   **C) Concept of 'Identity' confusion.** The student thinks that to keep a value "similar" or reach 1, they just use the same fraction but change the sign. They are confusing the additive inverse property (where values sum to zero) with the multiplicative property.
*   **D) Misinterpretation of the target.** The student sees $-1$ and thinks "nothing should change" or perhaps confuses the operation with addition (e.g., thinking if they add something similar they might reach a target). This is often a "guess" based on the numbers already present in the question.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK context, "Below Basic" usually corresponds to students working towards a Grade 1-2 at GCSE; "Basic" is Grade 3-4; "Proficient" is Grade 5-6; and "Advanced" is Grade 7+.

**below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=25% D=25%**
*At this level, students often guess based on the digits they see. Option B and C are very attractive because they "look" like the numbers in the prompt. Distinguishing between positive and negative outcomes is often a 50/50 chance for them.*

**basic: A=35% B=45% C=10% D=10%**
*These students understand that they need the "flip" (reciprocal) to get to 1. However, the "Two Negatives Rule" is a significant hurdle. Many will reflexively choose a negative multiplier (B) because they see a negative answer, not realizing it would cancel out the original negative sign.*

**proficient: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%**
*Proficient students have mastered the reciprocal and are generally more careful with signs. The most common error remaining here is B, usually due to working too quickly rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.*

**advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%**
*Advanced students recognize this immediately as a property of fractions. Errors here are rare and almost exclusively "slips" (accidental clicks or misreading the minus sign in the question).*
