As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific question as a test of two distinct skills: the arithmetic of adding fractions and the ability to follow specific formatting instructions ("Leave your answer as a mixed number").

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

**A) Correct reasoning:** The student adds the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and adds the numerators ($1 + 2 = 3$) while keeping the common denominator ($5$). They have also correctly followed the instruction to provide a mixed number.

**B) Correct arithmetic, incorrect format:** The student has successfully added the fractions (likely converting to improper fractions first: $\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}$) but has failed to read the instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number. This is a common error among higher-ability students who prefer working with improper fractions.

**C) Conceptual misunderstanding of denominators:** The student likely added the numerators ($1+2=3$ or $11+7=18$) but also added the denominators ($5+5=10$). This is the most common misconception in fraction addition, indicating a lack of understanding that the denominator represents the "size" of the parts.

**D) Partial correct reasoning with denominator error:** The student correctly added the whole numbers ($2+1=3$) and the numerators ($1+2=3$), but succumbed to the "add the denominators" trap ($5+5=10$). This shows they understand the structure of mixed numbers but not the rules of addition.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

**Below Basic**
*Students at this level often treat numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers.*
A=25% B=5% C=40% D=30%

**Basic**
*Students can handle whole numbers but are very prone to the "add the bottom" mistake or ignoring instructions.*
A=45% B=10% C=15% D=30%

**Proficient**
*Students generally understand common denominators but may occasionally misread the final formatting requirement.*
A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%

**Advanced**
*High mastery. Errors here are almost exclusively "slip" errors where they provide an improper fraction (B) because it is the standard form used in secondary higher-tier maths.*
A=92% B=7% C=0% D=1%
