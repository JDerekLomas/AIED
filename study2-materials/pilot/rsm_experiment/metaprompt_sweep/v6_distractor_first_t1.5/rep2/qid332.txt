As a UK maths teacher, I see this specific question frequently when teaching two-step equations. It tests the understanding of **order of operations in reverse** and the **distributive property of multiplication** over an entire side of an equation.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

*   **A) Only Tom:** This reasoning follows the standard "BIDMAS in reverse" flow taught in UK schools. The student recognizes that $+5$ is the inverse of $-5$ and applies it correctly to $12$, leaving the fraction untouched. This is mathematically sound.
*   **B) Only Katie:** This student likely knows they "need to multiply by 3" but incorrectly applies it. They multiply the $\frac{x}{3}$ to get $x$ and the $12$ to get $36$, but they forget to multiply the $-5$. This is a classic "operation misapplication" error.
*   **C) Both Tom and Katie:** This student is the most common. They correctly identify Tom's logic, but they fall for Katie’s trap. They believe that multiplying the "whole equation" by 3 means you only have to multiply the terms that "look like they need it" (the fraction and the result), missing the $-5$. They see Katie's $x-5=36$ and think it's a clever alternative.
*   **D) Neither is correct:** This student is likely over-complicating the steps or has a fundamental misunderstanding of basic algebraic manipulation, perhaps believing the first step must involve the $x$ or that the sign of 5 should change to positive on the same side.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK curriculum (KS3/KS4), we often find that the jump from "basic" to "proficient" is the realization that multiplication must be applied to *every* term.

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level often guess or struggle with any equation involving fractions. They may gravitate toward B or D because the notation looks "messy."
*   **Basic:** These students usually recognize one correct step but are easily fooled by common misconceptions. They are the prime candidates for choosing C.
*   **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of inverse operations. Most will identify Tom as correct, and many will spot the error in Katie’s logic, though some may still be tempted by C if they work too quickly.
*   **Advanced:** These students understand that if Katie were to multiply by 3, her equation would have to be $x - 15 = 36$. They will confidently select A.

| Ability Level | A (Tom) | B (Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 25% | 20% | 35% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 30% | 15% | 45% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 65% | 5% | 25% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 92% | 1% | 6% | 1% |

**Teacher's Note:** Option C is the "distractor of death" in this question. In a typical Year 9 classroom, I would expect nearly half the class to initially choose C before we discuss the "balancing" rule where *every* term on the left must be tripled if we triple the right.
