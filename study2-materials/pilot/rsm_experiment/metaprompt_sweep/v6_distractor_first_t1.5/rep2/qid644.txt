As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in Foundation Tier GCSE papers. It tests two distinct skills: identifying the correct operation (multiplication vs. addition) and applying integer sign rules.

### Step 1 — Analysis of Reasoning

*   **A) $+4$ (Correct):** The student correctly identifies that they must multiply $-1$ and $-4$. They apply the sign rule that a "negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive" ($1 \times 4 = 4$).
*   **B) $-4$:** The student understands they need to multiply, but they have a misconception regarding directed numbers. They might think "a negative and a negative stay negative" (confusing multiplication rules with addition rules) or simply forget to include the sign of the first term.
*   **C) $+5$:** The student has performed an addition rather than a multiplication ($(-1) + (-4) = -5$) and then either mistakenly changed the sign to positive or ignored the signs entirely ($1 + 4$). This is a common "operation confusion" error.
*   **D) $-5$:** The student has added the terms instead of multiplying them ($(-1) + (-4) = -5$). This is a very common error for students who see two terms in brackets and instinctively "combine" them as if simplifying an expression rather than expanding via multiplication.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK context, "Below Basic" corresponds to students working at Grades 1-2, "Basic" to Grade 3, "Proficient" to Grades 4-5, and "Advanced" to Grades 6+.

**below_basic:** A=15% B=30% C=20% D=35%  
*At this level, students often struggle with the definition of "expand" and frequently add the numbers. The presence of two minus signs often leads them to a negative answer ($D$).*

**basic:** A=40% B=25% C=10% D=25%  
*Students at this level know they should multiply, but about half will fail to apply the double-negative rule correctly, or will revert to addition if they are rushing.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=15% C=2% D=8%  
*Most students at this level have mastered the FOIL/Grid method and know that the last terms multiply to a positive. Errors here are usually due to "careless" sign flips or accidental addition.*

**advanced:** A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%  
*Errors at this level are extremely rare and almost exclusively down to a momentary lapse in concentration (slip of the pen).*
