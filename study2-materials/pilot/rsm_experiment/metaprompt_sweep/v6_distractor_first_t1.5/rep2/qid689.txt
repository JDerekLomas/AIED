As a UK maths teacher, I frequently see this specific type of algebraic fraction problem causing "cognitive conflict" because the variable is in the denominator. Students often default to their familiar "multiplication/division" patterns without considering the position of $p$.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

**A) $p = 0.5$ (Correct Reasoning)**
The student correctly rearranges the equation. They multiply both sides by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, then divide by $10$ to get $p = 5/10$. This demonstrates an understanding that to "undo" a division by $p$, you must multiply, and that $5 \div 10$ is not the same as $10 \div 5$.

**B) $p = 50$ (Multiplication Error)**
The student sees the numbers 10 and 5 and the fraction bar. Instead of rearranging, they perform the inverse operation of division (multiplication) on the constants alone ($10 \times 5$). They ignore the structure of the equation and assume that $p$ is simply the product of the two visible numbers.

**C) $p = 2$ (Division Order Error)**
This is the most common distractor. The student intuitively knows they need to divide to find $p$, but they instinctively divide the larger number by the smaller number ($10 \div 5 = 2$). They essentially treat the equation as $p = 10 \div 5$ rather than $10 = 5 \div p$.

**D) There are no solutions (Conceptual Confusion)**
The student may feel that "you can't have a smaller number on top of a bigger number" if they expect an integer answer, or they may be confused by the variable being in the denominator and conclude it's an impossible or "broken" equation.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, **below_basic** roughly corresponds to KS3 Level 3-4/GCSE Grade 1-2; **basic** to GCSE Grade 3-4; **proficient** to Grade 5-7; and **advanced** to Grade 8-9.

**below_basic:** 
A=10% B=40% C=45% D=5%
*Reasoning: Students here often "number grab," simply performing an operation (multiply or divide) on the two numbers they see.*

**basic:** 
A=25% B=20% C=50% D=5%
*Reasoning: Option C is the dominant choice here. These students know $10$ and $5$ are related by a factor of 2, and they choose the "neatest" looking result without checking if $5 \div 2$ actually equals $10$.*

**proficient:** 
A=70% B=5% C=24% D=1%
*Reasoning: Most students at this level understand the algebraic step of multiplying by $p$ first. However, under time pressure, a significant minority will still fall for the $10 \div 5$ trap.*

**advanced:** 
A=95% B=1% C=4% D=0%
*Reasoning: These students have mastered algebraic manipulation. Those who get it wrong usually do so due to a "careless" momentary lapse in processing the order of division.*
