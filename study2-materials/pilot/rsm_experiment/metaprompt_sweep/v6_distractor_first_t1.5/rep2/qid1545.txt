As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of problem frequently when teaching Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). It perfectly highlights the tension between reading left-to-right and following mathematical hierarchy.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) $>$ (Correct Reasoning):** The student applies BIDMAS correctly.
    *   Left side: $12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8 + 3 = 11$.
    *   Right side: $(8 + 12) = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.
    *   Since $11 > 5$, the symbol is $>$.
*   **B) $<$ (Misapplying Left-to-Right):** The student calculates the left side by simply moving left to right, ignoring division priority: $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$. They then see the right side also equals $5$ (or they see the right side looks "bigger" because of the brackets). Most often, this choice stems from a calculation error where they think the left side is smaller than the right side.
*   **C) $=$ (Fundamental Misunderstanding of Brackets):** The student assumes that because both sides contain $8, 12, 4,$ addition, and division, they must be equivalent. They likely believe brackets are "optional" or purely decorative, or they calculate both sides incorrectly as $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$.
*   **D) $\geq$ (Partial Understanding/Confusion):** The student may realise that $11$ is greater than $5$, but is confused by the formal notation or thinks "greater than or equal to" is a "safer" or more sophisticated version of the answer.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, "Below Basic" refers to students struggling with Year 6 expectations; "Basic" reflects students at a standard Grade 3/4 (GCSE) level; "Proficient" reflects Grade 5/6; and "Advanced" reflects Grade 7+.

**below_basic:** A=15% B=25% C=50% D=10%
*Reasoning:* These students almost always calculate left-to-right. They will see $(8+12)$ on the left and $(8+12)$ on the right and assume equality (C) or guess based on the visual "busyness" of the brackets.

**basic:** A=40% B=20% C=35% D=5%
*Reasoning:* These students have heard of BIDMAS but often forget to apply it if the addition comes first. Option C remains a strong "distractor" because the numbers match exactly.

**proficient:** A=75% B=10% C=12% D=3%
*Reasoning:* Most students at this level routinely apply BIDMAS. Errors here are usually due to "careless" reading—scanning the numbers and assuming they are a distributive property identity without actually calculating.

**advanced:** A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
*Reasoning:* For advanced students, this is a "10-second" question. The only errors are likely "optical illusions" (misreading a sign) rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.
