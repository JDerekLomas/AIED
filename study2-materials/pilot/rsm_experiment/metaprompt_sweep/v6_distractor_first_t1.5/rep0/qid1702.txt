As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of linear equation problem frequently in GCSE Foundation and Higher tiers. It tests algebraic substitution and the ability to handle negative numbers when rearranging equations.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

*   **A) 3.3 (Correct Reasoning):**
    Substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$. This simplifies to $10x - 3 = 30$. Adding 3 to both sides gives $10x = 33$, and dividing by 10 gives $x = 3.3$.
*   **B) 4.25 (Arithmetic/Sign Error):**
    The student substitutes $0.5$ correctly but makes an error in calculation or forgets the coefficient of 6. Alternatively, they might do $30 \div 6 = 5$, then $5 - 0.5$ and try to work backwards. However, the most common route to 4.25 is thinking $10x = 30 + 12.5$ or a similar confusion with the $6y$ term (treating $6y$ as $6 + y$).
*   **C) 2.7 (Sign Error during Rearrangement):**
    The student substitutes $y = 0.5$ correctly to get $10x - 3 = 30$, but when moving the $-3$ to the other side, they subtract it instead of adding it: $10x = 30 - 3$, leading to $10x = 27$ and $x = 2.7$.
*   **D) -4.25 (Inverse Substitution / Sign Error):**
    The student likely confused the $x$ and $y$ variables or made a significant error involving negative signs when attempting to isolate $x$, often leading to a negative result because they subtracted 30 from 3 or vice versa.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK system, **below_basic** students often struggle with the "minus" sign in the equation, while **proficient** students usually possess the algebraic skills but are prone to "silly" sign errors when moving terms across the equals sign.

*   **below_basic** (Targeting Grade 1-2):
    *   *These students often guess or perform operations with the numbers they see without a clear algebraic strategy.*
    *   A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%
*   **basic** (Targeting Grade 3-4):
    *   *These students know to substitute, but often make the common mistake of subtracting 3 from 30 rather than adding.*
    *   A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
*   **proficient** (Targeting Grade 5-6):
    *   *Most will get this right, but the 2.7 distractor is highly effective for those working too quickly.*
    *   A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
*   **advanced** (Targeting Grade 7+):
    *   *Errors are rare at this level; substitution and rearrangement are foundational skills.*
    *   A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
