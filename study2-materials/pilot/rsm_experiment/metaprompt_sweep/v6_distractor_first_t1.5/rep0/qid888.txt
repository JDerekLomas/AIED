As a UK maths teacher, I frequently see this specific quadratic expansion used to test a student's command of negative integers. The "double negative" at the end of the expression is the primary discriminator.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

*   **A) $m^{2}-2 m-35$**
    The student has incorrectly combined the middle terms by calculating $-7 + 5 = -2$ (ignoring the negative on the 5) or has mistakenly performed $7 - 5$. Additionally, they have applied the rule "a negative and a positive make a negative" to the final constant, missing that both numbers are negative.
*   **B) $m^{2}-12 m+35$**
    **Correct Reasoning.** The student correctly uses FOIL or the grid method: $m \times m = m^2$; $-7m - 5m = -12m$; and criticaly, $-5 \times -7 = +35$.
*   **C) $m^{2}+12 m+35$**
    The student understands that two negatives multiply to make a positive for the $+35$, but they have ignored the signs when summing the middle terms, treating $-5m - 7m$ as $5m + 7m$. 
*   **D) $m^{2}-12 m-35$**
    The student correctly calculates the middle term ($-5 - 7 = -12$), but fails the integer multiplication for the constant. This is the most common error in the UK GCSE Higher tier foundation—remembering to add the negatives for the linear term but forgetting that "negative times negative is positive" for the constant.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK system, **Below Basic** corresponds to students struggling for a Grade 3; **Basic** to those at a Grade 4/5 (C/B boundary); **Proficient** to Grade 7 (A); and **Advanced** to Grade 8/9 ($A^*$).

**below_basic:** A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%
*(Students at this level often guess or pick C because "minus and minus makes plus" is over-applied to the middle term, or D because they expect the minus sign to persist throughout.)*

**basic:** A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
*(The "D error" is the dominant mistake here. Students can expand brackets but frequently forget the sign rule for the constant term under exam pressure.)*

**proficient:** A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
*(By this stage, students are fluent with FOIL/Grid method. Errors are usually down to rushing (Option D) rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.)*

**advanced:** A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%
*(Top-end students see this as a "standard" question. Errors are extremely rare and usually purely clerical.)*
