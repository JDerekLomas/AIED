As a UK maths teacher, I often see this specific problem when teaching "Rearranging and Solving Linear Equations" to Key Stage 3 and 4 students. The "change side, change sign" rule often leads to the specific error found in Step 2.

### Step 1 — Analysis of Reasoning

*   **A) Only step 1:** The student correctly identifies that they must multiply by 4 first ($15 \times 4 = 60$). However, they recognize that in Step 2, Isaac added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting it. They correctly identify that $k$ should be 59, making Step 2 incorrect.
*   **B) Only step 2:** This is a rare choice. A student might choose this if they believe Step 1 was illegal (perhaps thinking they should subtract 1 first, but mistakenly ignoring the denominator) but somehow feel the final answer "looks right" or have made two cancelling errors.
*   **C) Both steps are correct:** The student understands the first step (multiplication) but suffers from a "sign error" or "operation confusion" in the second. They see $1 + k$ and think that because it is a "plus 1," they should add it to the other side to "solve" it, or they are simply performing $60 + 1$ without considering inverse operations.
*   **D) Both steps are incorrect:** The student likely believes that you cannot multiply by 4 first. They might think you have to subtract 1 first (misunderstanding the fraction bar as a grouping symbol that prioritizes the division) or they may have calculated $15 \times 4$ incorrectly.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, **Below Basic** represents students working at Low Foundation GCSE level (Grades 1-2). **Basic** represents standard Foundation (Grades 3-4). **Proficient** represents Higher Tier (Grades 5-7). **Advanced** represents those aiming for Grades 8-9.

**below_basic:** A=15% B=5% C=60% D=20%
*Reasoning:* These students often see any mathematical movement as "correct" if it results in an answer. They heavily favour option C because they don't yet distinguish between when to add and when to subtract during transposition.

**basic:** A=35% B=5% C=50% D=10%
*Reasoning:* At this level, students are more confident with the first step of "undoing" a fraction. However, the common mistake of adding 1 to 60 (Step 2) is a very "sticky" misconception at the Grade 4 level.

**proficient:** A=75% B=2% C=20% D=3%
*Reasoning:* These students generally have a good grasp of inverse operations. They will spot the error in Step 2 ($60 - 1 = 59$) almost immediately and confidently select A.

**advanced:** A=96% B=0% C=3% D=1%
*Reasoning:* Advanced students will find this trivial. The only errors here would be from "overthinking" the question or extreme secondary-school fatigue.
