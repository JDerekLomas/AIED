As a UK maths teacher, I see this specific question frequently in GCSE Foundation and Higher tier papers. It tests the ability to find a common denominator involving algebraic terms.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) $\frac{11}{2x}$ (Correct Reasoning):** The student identifies the lowest common denominator (LCD) as $2x$. They convert $\frac{4}{x}$ into an equivalent fraction by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 2, resulting in $\frac{8}{2x}$. They then correctly add the numerators: $3 + 8 = 11$, and keep the denominator the same.
*   **B) $\frac{7}{3x}$ (The "Add Everything" Error):** This is a classic misconception where students treat fractions like whole numbers. They add the numerators $(3 + 4 = 7)$ and add the denominators $(2x + x = 3x)$. This demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of fraction equivalence.
*   **C) $\frac{11}{x}$ (Numerator Change/Denominator Fail):** The student correctly identifies that they need to multiply the 4 by 2, but they either "lose" the 2 from the first denominator or incorrectly think that the $x$ from the second fraction becomes the master denominator without acknowledging the "2" in $2x$.
*   **D) $\frac{7}{2x}$ (The "Common Denominator but No Numerator Change" Error):** The student recognizes that $2x$ is the common denominator. However, they forget to scale the numerator of the second fraction. They simply add the existing numerators $(3 + 4)$ over the new denominator.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, **"Below Basic"** corresponds to students struggling at Grade 1-2; **"Basic"** to Grade 3-4; **"Proficient"** to Grade 5-6; and **"Advanced"** to Grade 7+.

**below_basic:** A=15% B=55% C=10% D=20%
*Reasoning: High tendency to add straight across (B) or simply pick the most common denominator without adjusting numerators (D).*

**basic:** A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
*Reasoning: Students know they need a common denominator, but a large portion will make the "Distributive Law" error in D, forgetting to double the 4.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
*Reasoning: Most students at this level have mastered algebraic fractions, but "D" remains a common "careless" mistake under exam pressure.*

**advanced:** A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
*Reasoning: This is a routine skill for high-achieving students; errors are almost exclusively due to reading the question too quickly.*
