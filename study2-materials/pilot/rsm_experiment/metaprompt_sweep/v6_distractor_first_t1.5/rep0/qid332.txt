As a UK maths teacher, I see this specific problem frequently when teaching Year 8 and Year 9 (Key Stage 3) algebra. It tests a student's understanding of **order of operations in reverse** and the **distributive property** when clearing fractions.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

**A) Only Tom**
*   **Reasoning:** Tom is performing the inverse operation of $-5$ by adding $5$ to both sides. This is the standard "step-by-step" approach taught in UK schools ($12 + 5 = 17$). Students choosing this often believe you *must* isolate the fraction term before multiplying, and they see Katie's move as a "violation" because they forget to multiply the $-5$ by $3$.

**B) Only Katie**
*   **Reasoning:** Katie is attempting to "clear the fraction" by multiplying by $3$. However, she has only multiplied the $x/3$ and the $12$, failing to multiply the $-5$ by $3$. This is the most common misconception in linear equations. Students choosing this often have a "surface-level" rule in their heads that "if there is a 3 on the bottom, you multiply the other side by 3."

**C) Both Tom and Katie**
*   **Reasoning:** This student correctly identifies that Tom's step is valid. However, they also mistakenly believe Katie's step is valid. They likely think that you can choose to "move the 3" or "move the 5" independently, failing to realise that if you multiply by $3$ first, **every term** in the equation must be multiplied ($x - 15 = 36$).

**D) Neither is correct**
*   **Reasoning:** This is usually a result of poor arithmetic or a fundamental misunderstanding of inverse operations. A student might think Tom is wrong because they subtracted 5 ($12-5=7$) or they might be looking for the final solution ($x=51$) and reject any intermediate steps that don't look like their own working.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK context:
*   **Below Basic:** Grade 1–2 (Functional Skills level). Often struggle with directed numbers and basic inverses.
*   **Basic:** Grade 3–4 (Foundation GCSE). Can solve two-step equations but often make "fraction" errors.
*   **Proficient:** Grade 5–6 (Crossover/Higher). Solid on two-step equations, but often over-confident and miss the nuance of Katie's error.
*   **Advanced:** Grade 7+ (Higher Tier). Strong grasp of algebraic structures and distributive laws.

| Ability Level | A (Only Tom) | B (Only Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 35% | 30% | 15% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 15% | 35% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 65% | 5% | 28% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 92% | 1% | 6% | 1% |

**Teacher's Note on the "C Trap":**
Option C is the most common distractor for proficient students. In my experience, even students who can solve the equation correctly themselves will often look at Katie's work and think, "Oh, she's just clearing the fraction, that's allowed," without checking if she applied the multiplier to the constant term $(-5)$. This is why Option A only reaches 92% even at the Advanced level—rushed reading in a multiple-choice format often leads to picking C.
