As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this question as a test of two distinct skills: recall of the geometric formula for the volume of a sphere and the algebraic proficiency required to rearrange a formula where the subject is cubed.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

**A) $\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V\pi}{3}}$**
The student has the correct formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) but fails at basic algebraic manipulation. Instead of dividing by $4\pi$ to move it to the other side of the equation, they have multiplied the volume by $4\pi$. This is a common error for students who struggle with inverse operations.

**B) $\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}$**
The student has likely misremembered the formula as $V = \frac{3}{4}\pi r^3$ or has attempted to rearrange the correct formula but swapped the positions of the 3 and the 4. They understand that $\pi$ and the coefficient must be moved, but they have inverted the fraction incorrectly during the process.

**C) $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$ (Correct)**
The student correctly identifies the volume of a sphere as $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. They multiply by 3 ($3V = 4\pi r^3$), divide by $4\pi$ ($\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$), and then take the cube root of the entire expression to isolate $r$.

**D) $\frac{3\sqrt[3]{V}}{4\pi}$**
This student suffers from "incomplete radicalisation." They recognise that a cube root is needed because of $r^3$, but they apply it only to the $V$ or they forget that when taking the cube root of an equation, it must apply to the entire side. They have also potentially confused the order of operations in rearranging.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK curriculum (GCSE), this is a "Higher Tier" style question. 

*   **Below Basic:** Students who may not know the formula at all and are guessing based on which looks most "mathematical."
*   **Basic:** Students who know the formula but frequently make "cross-multiplication" errors.
*   **Proficient:** Students who can rearrange 2-step equations well but might make a slip under pressure.
*   **Advanced:** Students targeting Grade 8/9 who treat literal equations as routine.

| Ability Level | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 30% | 25% | 15% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 25% | 30% | 20% |
| **Proficient** | 10% | 15% | 65% | 10% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 3% | 94% | 1% |

**Teacher's Note:** Option B is a particularly "sticky" distractor because the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ is so ingrained in students' minds that they often forget to invert it when it moves to the other side of the equals sign.
