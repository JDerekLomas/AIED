As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen this specific problem type catch out many students. This question isn't testing the full expansion process, but rather the specific "negative times a negative" rule, which is a common stumbling block even for students who understand the FOIL/Grid method.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) +4:** This is the **correct reasoning**. The student identifies that they must multiply the term $-1$ by the term $-4$. They correctly apply the sign rule: a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive ($1 \times 4 = 4$).
*   **B) -4:** This is a **sign error**. The student knows to multiply $1 \times 4$, but they either assume that because there are minus signs in the brackets, the result must be negative, or they simply carry over the sign of the terms without applying the multiplicative sign rule.
*   **C) +5:** This is an **operation error (addition)**. The student has ignored the instruction to "multiply" and has instead added the absolute values ($1 + 4$). They may have mistakenly applied the "two negatives make a positive" rule to the addition.
*   **D) -5:** This is an **operation error (combining)**. The student has added the two terms $(-1) + (-4)$ instead of multiplying them. This is a very common mistake for students who confuse the rules for "adding/collecting like terms" with the rules for "expanding/multiplying."

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

I have categorized "Ability Level" based on Typical GCSE (9-1) target grades: 
*   *Below Basic (Grade 1-2)*
*   *Basic (Grade 3-4)*
*   *Proficient (Grade 5-6)*
*   *Advanced (Grade 7-9)*

| Level | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 30% | 15% | 35% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 25% | 5% | 25% |
| **Proficient** | 75% | 15% | 2% | 8% |
| **Advanced** | 96% | 3% | 0% | 1% |

**Teacher Commentary on the Data:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students here struggle to distinguish between addition and multiplication rules. You will see a high percentage choosing **D** because they see $-1$ and $-4$ and instinctively "combine" them to get $-5$.
*   **Basic:** At this level, students know they should multiply, which eliminates C and D for many. However, the "negative x negative = positive" rule is still fragile, leading many to stick with **B**.
*   **Proficient:** Most students get this right, but "silly" sign errors (**B**) still occur under exam pressure.
*   **Advanced:** Students at this level almost never make the operation error; any errors here are usually due to misreading the question or extreme haste.
