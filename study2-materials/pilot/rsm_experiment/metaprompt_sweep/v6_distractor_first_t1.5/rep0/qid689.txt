As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have encountered this specific algebraic misconception many times. The difficulty lies in the variable being in the denominator; students frequently struggle to decide whether to multiply or divide and in which order.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) \( p=0.5 \): [Correct Reasoning]** The student correctly identifies that to solve for \(p\), they must multiply both sides by \(p\) to get \(10p = 5\), and then divide by 10 to get \(p = 5/10\). They correctly simplify this to 0.5.
*   **B) \( p=50 \): [Misconception: Inverse Operation Error]** The student sees the division sign and knows they should use an inverse operation, but they apply it to the wrong number. They calculate \(10 \times 5 = 50\), essentially treating the equation as if it were \(\frac{p}{5} = 10\).
*   **C) \( p=2 \): [Misconception: Division Order/Commutativity Error]** This is the most common error. The student realizes they need to divide 10 and 5, but they instinctively divide the larger number by the smaller number (\(10 \div 5\)) rather than following the algebraic steps to get \(5 \div 10\).
*   **D) There are no solutions: [Conceptual Confusion]** The student may feel that because 10 is larger than 5, you cannot divide 5 by a positive number and result in a larger number. They lack the understanding of reciprocal values and fractions.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In a UK context, **Below Basic** refers to students working at GCSE Grade 1–2, **Basic** to Grades 3–4, **Proficient** to Grades 5–6, and **Advanced** to Grades 7–9.

**below_basic:** A=10% B=30% C=50% D=10%
*Reasoning: Students at this level almost always gravitate towards Option C because "10 divided by 5 is 2." If they don't pick C, they usually guess that they should multiply the two visible numbers (Option B).*

**basic:** A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%
*Reasoning: This is the "danger zone" for Option C. These students have some algebraic knowledge but often rush and perform the division in the wrong order. Option A starts to appear as students become more comfortable with decimals/fractions.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
*Reasoning: Most students here will perform the two-step rearrangement (\(10p=5 \rightarrow p=0.5\)) correctly. However, under exam pressure, a significant minority will still fall for the "10 divided by 5" trap.*

**advanced:** A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
*Reasoning: Advanced students recognize the structure of the equation (\(a = b/x\) implies \(x = b/a\)) immediately. Errors here are rare and usually due to extreme "silly mistakes" rather than lack of understanding.*
