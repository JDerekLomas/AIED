As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen this specific question many times in Key Stage 3 and GCSE Foundation settings. The main hurdles here are the understanding of "mixed numbers" versus "improper fractions" and the common misconception regarding denominators when adding fractions.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

**A) Correct reasoning.** The student adds the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and adds the numerators of the fractional parts ($1 + 2 = 3$) while correctly maintaining the common denominator ($5$). They have followed the instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number.

**B) Mathematical correctness but incorrect format.** The student correctly calculates the value ($\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}$), but fails to read the final part of the prompt: "Leave your answer as a mixed number." This represents a failure in exam technique rather than arithmetic.

**C) Double misconception.** This is the most common error for low-ability students. The student likely adds the numerators ($1 + 2 = 3$) and adds the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$). They then either forget the whole numbers entirely or attempt to convert a poorly calculated mixed number into a single fraction. Alternatively, they may have simply added every digit they saw: $2+1+1+2+5+5 = 16$ (close to 18) and put it over $10$.

**D) Denominator misconception.** The student correctly adds the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and the numerators ($1 + 2 = 3$), but makes the classic error of adding the denominators together ($5 + 5 = 10$). This is a very common "intuitive" mistake.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK system, **Below Basic** refers to students working significantly below age-related expectations (Lower KS3). **Basic** refers to Foundation GCSE students. **Proficient** refers to students targetting a Grade 4/5. **Advanced** refers to Higher Tier students.

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Wrong Format) | C (Calculation Error) | D (Add Denominators) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 10% | 30% | 40% |
| **Basic** | 55% | 15% | 5% | 25% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 10% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0% | 1% |

**Teacher's Note on Distributions:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many students at this level believe that in math, you "do the same to the top as the bottom," leading them to add the 5s to get 10.
*   **Basic/Proficient:** You see a spike in Option B here. These students know how to calculate with fractions (often preferring to convert to improper fractions first), but they are prone to "answering the math" rather than "answering the question," thus ignoring the mixed number instruction.
*   **Advanced:** Almost 100% should get this right; any errors are usually "slips" or misreading Option B as a mixed number at a quick glance.
