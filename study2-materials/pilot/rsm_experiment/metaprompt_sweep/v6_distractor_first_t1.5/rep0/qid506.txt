As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of equation frequently in GCSE Foundation and higher-tier preparation. The common pitfall here is "operational confusion" when dealing with fractions and coefficients.

### Step 1 — Analysis of Reasoning

*   **A) \( p=\frac{1}{4} \)**
    The student incorrectly performs $12 \div 3$ instead of $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$. They see the numbers 3 and 12 and instinctively divide the larger by the smaller, maintaining the fraction structure but placing the result in the denominator incorrectly ($1 / (12 \div 3)$).
*   **B) \( p=\frac{1}{36} \)**
    **Correct reasoning.** To isolate $p$, both sides must be divided by 3. Dividing a fraction by an integer is equivalent to multiplying the denominator by that integer: $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$.
*   **C) \( p=4 \)**
    The student ignores the fraction entirely or "clears" the fraction incorrectly. They likely see $3p$ and $12$ and simply divide $12$ by $3$, treating the equation as if it were $3p = 12$.
*   **D) \( p=\frac{1}{9} \)**
    This usually stems from a subtraction error. The student "moves" the 3 across the equals sign and subtracts it from the denominator ($12 - 3 = 9$), or misremembers a multiplication fact (e.g., thinking $3 \times 3 = 12$ in a moment of stress).

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK context, **below_basic** corresponds to students struggling with Functional Skills or low-entry GCSE; **basic** to Grade 3-4; **proficient** to Grade 5-6; and **advanced** to Grade 7+.

**below_basic:** A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
*Reasoning:* These students often disregard the fraction bar or perform "intuitive" calculations using whole numbers, making Option C highly attractive.

**basic:** A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
*Reasoning:* Students at this level know they should divide, but frequently divide the denominator by the coefficient (Option A) rather than multiplying them.

**proficient:** A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
*Reasoning:* By this level, the rule "to divide a fraction, multiply the denominator" is usually well-drilled, though occasional "brain-fades" lead to Option A.

**advanced:** A=2% B=97% C=1% D=0%
*Reasoning:* Advanced students recognize this as a one-step calculation. Errors here are almost exclusively down to rushing rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.
