As a UK maths teacher, I have seen this specific type of question trip up many students. The combination of indices, decimal multiplication, and the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) provides several "trap doors" for students at different levels.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

*   **A) 0.81:** This comes from an **order of operations error**. The student multiplies $3$ by $0.3$ first to get $0.9$, and then squares the result ($0.9 \times 0.9 = 0.81$). This is the $(3x)^2$ error.
*   **B) 0.27: This is the correct answer.** The student correctly follows BIDMAS, squaring $0.3$ first ($0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$) and then multiplying by $3$ ($0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$).
*   **C) 1.8:** This is a **conceptual error regarding powers**. The student interprets $x^2$ as $2x$. They calculate $0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$, and then multiply by $3$ (or perhaps $3 \times 0.3 \times 2$). It reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of indices.
*   **D) 2.7:** This is a **place value/decimal multiplication error**. The student understands the steps (square then multiply) but fails at the decimal placement. They calculate $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ (forgetting the second decimal place) and then $0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

**Below Basic**
*Students at this level often struggle with the meaning of the notation $x^2$ and the priority of operations.*
A=30% B=15% C=40% D=15%

**Basic**
*These students generally know that $x^2$ means "multiply by itself," but they almost always perform the operations from left to right or struggle with decimal place value.*
A=40% B=25% C=10% D=25%

**Proficient**
*Students at this level understand BIDMAS and indices, but the "mental math" of $0.3 \times 0.3$ is a notorious weak point, leading them to the decimal error in Option D.*
A=15% B=55% C=5% D=25%

**Advanced**
*These students are fluent in decimal arithmetic and the order of operations. Errors here are usually due to rare "exam slips" or rushing.*
A=5% B=90% C=0% D=5%
