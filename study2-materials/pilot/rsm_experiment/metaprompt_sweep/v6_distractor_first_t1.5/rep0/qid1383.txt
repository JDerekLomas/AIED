As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in Foundation and Higher tier GCSE papers. It tests two distinct skills: understanding of index notation and the rules for multiplying negative numbers.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) 81 (Correct):** The student correctly identifies that $(-3)^4$ means $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$. They understand that an even number of negative factors results in a positive product (9 × 9 = 81).
*   **B) 12:** The student has confused exponentiation with multiplication ($k \times 4$). They have calculated $(-3) \times 4 = -12$ but have either ignored the sign or intentionally "made it positive" because they associate squares/powers with positive results.
*   **C) -81:** The student understands that $3^4 = 81$, but they have a common misconception regarding the order of operations or the effect of the exponent on a negative base. They likely calculated $-(3^4)$, treating the negative sign as separate from the number being raised to the power.
*   **D) -12:** The student has made two errors: confusing powers with multiplication ($k \times 4$) and correctly applying the sign for a single multiplication $(-3) \times 4$.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions:

These distributions reflect typical UK secondary school cohorts (Year 9–11).

*   **below_basic:** (Students struggling with numeracy and basic order of operations)
    *   **A=15% B=30% C=20% D=35%**
    *   *Reasoning:* At this level, the "multiplication instead of power" error (B and D) is dominant. Students often guess between the positive and negative versions of the product.

*   **basic:** (Standard Foundation tier students)
    *   **A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%**
    *   *Reasoning:* Students generally recognize that $3^4$ is not 12, but the "sign error" (Option C) becomes a major distractor as they aren't sure if the negative stays or goes.

*   **proficient:** (Borderline Foundation/Higher or mid-range Higher tier)
    *   **A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%**
    *   *Reasoning:* These students rarely make the $k \times 4$ error. The primary battle is between A and C. Many students at this level incorrectly believe that if the input is negative, the output must be negative.

*   **advanced:** (High-achieving Higher tier / Target Grade 8-9)
    *   **A=94% B=1% C=5% D=0%**
    *   *Reasoning:* Advanced students know that an even power eliminates the negative sign. The only errors here are usually due to "careless slips" or over-reliance on a calculator where they might have typed $-3^4$ without brackets, leading them to C.
