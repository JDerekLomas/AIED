As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently when teaching Year 8 or Year 9 (ages 12-14). It tests two distinct concepts: the **multiplicative inverse (reciprocals)** and **directed number arithmetic (negative signs)**.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) $\frac{4}{3}$:** This is the **correct reasoning**. The student understands that to get a product of 1 (ignoring the sign for a moment), they need the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$, which is $\frac{4}{3}$. They also correctly apply the rule that a *negative* multiplied by a *positive* results in a *negative* outcome.
*   **B) $-\frac{4}{3}$:** The student understands the **reciprocal property** (that flipping the fraction leads to a product of 1) but makes a sign error. They may incorrectly believe that "to get a negative answer, both numbers must be negative," or they are confusing this with the rule for finding a perpendicular gradient where you "flip and change the sign."
*   **C) $\frac{3}{4}$:** The student has a **procedural misconception**. They see the number $\frac{3}{4}$ in the question and assume the answer must be the same digits, simply removing the negative sign because "the answer is negative and we started with a negative." They do not understand the multiplicative property of fractions.
*   **D) $-\frac{3}{4}$:** This is a **common confusion with addition**. The student might be thinking $- \frac{3}{4} + 0 = -\frac{3}{4}$, or they are simply overwhelmed by the notation and select one of the numbers already present in the expression, hoping for a "identity" result.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK curriculum, "Below Basic" students often struggle with the very concept of a fraction, while "Advanced" students (targeting Grades 8/9 at GCSE) handle negatives and reciprocals fluently.

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Sign Error) | C (Identity) | D (Random/Copy) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 20% | 35% | 35% |
| **Basic** | 35% | 30% | 20% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 65% | 25% | 5% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 95% | 4% | 1% | 0% |

#### Teacher’s Commentary on the Distributions:
*   **Below Basic:** Students here often treat numbers as symbols to be moved rather than values. Many will pick **C** or **D** simply because those numbers are already "in the box."
*   **Basic:** This is where the most frustration occurs. These students know that "flipping" is involved with fractions and 1, so they narrow it down to A and B, but they have a roughly 50/50 chance of getting the sign correct. Many over-apply the "two negatives make a positive" rule to the inputs without looking at the output.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually have mastered the reciprocal. The 25% who choose **B** are usually working too quickly and apply the "negative reciprocal" rule (used for perpendicular lines in coordinate geometry), which is a very common "interference" error at this level.
*   **Advanced:** Almost all students at this level will recognize that $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -\frac{12}{12} = -1$ instantly.
