As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle fraction arithmetic. This specific question tests three distinct skills: finding a common denominator, converting between mixed numbers and improper fractions, and following the specific formatting instructions of the question.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) $\frac{99}{20}$:** The student has correctly calculated the sum. They likely converted to improper fractions ($\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4}$) and found the common denominator of 20 ($\frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$). However, they failed to "Leave the answer as a mixed number" as instructed.
*   **B) $4 \frac{19}{20}$:** This is the **correct answer**. The student added the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and found a common denominator for the fractions ($\frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20}$), combining them correctly.
*   **C) $\frac{99}{40}$:** The student found a common denominator by multiplying $10 \times 4$ but failed to adjust the numerators correctly, or they reached $\frac{99}{20}$ and then mistakenly doubled the denominator thinking it worked like an equivalent fraction. It often represents a "guess" based on seeing the correct numerator (99) from option A.
*   **D) $4 \frac{8}{14}$:** This represents the most common misconception in fraction addition: adding the "top" numbers and the "bottom" numbers separately ($7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$). This student understands how to add whole numbers but lacks a conceptual understanding of denominators.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

In the UK system, **Below Basic** refers to students working significantly below age-related expectations (Foundation Tier/low Grade 1-2). **Basic** corresponds to a secure Grade 3-4. **Proficient** represents a solid Grade 5-6 (Higher Tier crossover). **Advanced** represents Grade 7-9.

| Ability Level | A (The Improper) | B (Correct) | C (The Guess) | D (The Adder) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 15% | 25% | **50%** |
| **Basic** | 20% | **45%** | 10% | 25% |
| **Proficient** | 25% | **70%** | 0% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | **95%** | 0% | 0% |

#### Teacher’s Commentary on the Distributions:
*   **Below Basic:** Option D is a magnet for these students. Adding across the numerators and denominators is the "default" logic for students who have not yet grasped the need for a common denominator.
*   **Basic:** Students at this level often know the "method" for fractions but make arithmetic slips. Many will successfully find the answer but might get lured by the complexity of the improper fraction in Option C if they lose confidence halfway through.
*   **Proficient:** These students rarely choose D, but their biggest hurdle is **Option A**. In a high-stakes exam (like GCSE), proficient students often solve the math correctly but forget to check the final "format" requested in the question (Mixed Number).
*   **Advanced:** These students almost universally get this correct. The only ones who choose A are those who are rushing and failing to read the final sentence of the prompt.
