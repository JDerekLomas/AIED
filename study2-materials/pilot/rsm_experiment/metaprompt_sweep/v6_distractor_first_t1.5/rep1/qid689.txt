As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in GCSE Foundation and early Higher tier papers. It tests a student's ability to handle unknowns in the denominator, which is a common stumbling block.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) \( p=0.5 \)**: **[Correct Reasoning]** The student correctly multiplies both sides by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, then divides by 10 to get $p = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5$. Alternatively, they recognize that 5 divided by "something" is 10, and deduce that the "something" must be a half.
*   **B) \( p=50 \)**: **[Misconception: Inverse Operations Error]** The student sees the division sign and knows they should multiply, but they multiply the two visible constants ($10 \times 5$) without considering the algebraic structure. This is a very common "low-effort" error.
*   **C) \( p=2 \)**: **[Misconception: Commutative Error/Division Direction]** The student correctly identifies that there is a relationship between 10, 5, and 2, but they divide in the wrong order ($10 \div 5$) rather than ($5 \div 10$). They assume the larger number must be divided by the smaller one.
*   **D) There are no solutions**: **[Misconception: Conceptual Confusion]** The student believes that because 10 is larger than 5, you cannot divide 5 by a positive number and get a larger result. They do not yet understand that dividing by a decimal between 0 and 1 increases the quotient.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, **below_basic** refers to students working at Grades 1-2, **basic** to Grade 3, **proficient** to Grades 4-5, and **advanced** to Grades 6+.

**below_basic:**
*   A=10% B=45% C=35% D=10%
*   *At this level, students often grab the numbers and perform a basic operation. Option B is highly attractive because it avoids fractions.*

**basic:**
*   A=30% B=25% C=40% D=5%
*   *Students at this level realize the answer isn't 50, but they instinctively reach for "10 divided by 5" because it results in a whole number.*

**proficient:**
*   A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
*   *Most students have mastered the multi-step nature of "unknowns on the bottom," though a significant minority will still commit the "division direction" error (C).*

**advanced:**
*   A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
*   *The primary error here is usually a "slip" (Option C) rather than a lack of understanding. Option D is virtually non-existent at this level.*
