As a UK maths teacher, I see these types of linear equation problems frequently. The primary hurdles for students here are rearranging formulae, handling negative signs, and performing division correctly.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

*   **A) 3.3 (Correct Reasoning):** The student substitutes $y = 0.5$ into the equation: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30$. They correctly add 3 to both sides to get $10x = 33$, and finally divide by 10 to reach $x = 3.3$.
*   **B) 2.7 (Sign Error in Rearranging):** The student substitutes $y = 0.5$ correctly to get $10x - 3 = 30$, but then performs the inverse operation incorrectly. They subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it: $10x = 27$, leading to $x = 2.7$.
*   **C) 4.25 (Substituted $x$ instead of $y$):** The student confuses the rows of the table. They substitute $0.5$ for $x$ instead of $y$: $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30$. Then $-6y = 25 \Rightarrow y = -4.16...$ but more likely, they do $30 - 5 = 25$ then $25 \div 6 = 4.16$, which they might round or miscalculate as 4.25. Alternatively, they might do $30 + 10(0.5) = 35$, then $35 \div 8$ or similar. It represents a "substitution into the wrong variable" error.
*   **D) -4.25 (Variable Swap and Negative Sign Error):** Similar to option C, the student substitutes $x = 0.5$ and then struggles with the resulting negative coefficient of $y$, arriving at a negative result.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK system, **Below Basic** (Bottom Set/Foundation) students struggle significantly with multi-step algebra. **Basic** (Mid-tier) students can substitute but often fail the "inverse operation" step. **Proficient** (Higher Tier/Level 6-7) students usually get it right but make occasional slips. **Advanced** (Level 8-9) students almost always solve this correctly.

| Ability Level | A (3.3) | B (2.7) | C (4.25) | D (-4.25) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 30% | 25% | 25% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 35% | 10% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 80% | 15% | 3% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0.5% | 0.5% |

*Note: The "Basic" level sees a high percentage for **B** because the mistake of "subtracting the 3" is a very common misconception when students see a minus sign in the original equation and intuitively think they should subtract.*
