As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen hundreds of students tackle the "FOIL" method (Firsts, Outers, Inners, Lasts) or the grid method for expanding double brackets. This specific question tests two distinct skills: combining linear terms with like signs and the multiplication of negative integers.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

**A) $m^{2}-2 m-35$**
*   **Reasoning:** The student has confused the signs or operations for both the middle and end terms. For the middle term, they likely performed $-7 + 5$ or $7 - 5$ instead of $-7 - 5$. For the constant term, they calculated $-7 \times 5$ or simply saw the two signs and incorrectly concluded a negative result, failing to apply the "negative $\times$ negative = positive" rule.

**B) $m^{2}-12 m+35$**
*   **Reasoning:** This is the **correct** answer. The student successfully expanded to get $m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35$. They correctly simplified $-7m - 5m$ to $-12m$ and correctly identified that $-5 \times -7 = +35$.

**C) $m^{2}+12 m+35$**
*   **Reasoning:** The student understands that the constant term is positive, but they have made a sign error in the summation of the linear terms. They likely added the absolute values ($7 + 5$) but ignored the negative signs attached to them in the brackets, treating the expression as if it were $(m+5)(m+7)$.

**D) $m^{2}-12 m-35$**
*   **Reasoning:** This is the most common "near-miss" error. The student is proficient at the algebraic process of combining $-7m$ and $-5m$ to get $-12m$, but they have a conceptual weakness regarding Directed Numbers. They see the two minus signs in the brackets and assume the final constant must also be negative, forgetting that a negative multiplied by a negative produces a positive.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, "Below Basic" students are often still struggling with single brackets; "Basic" students (Foundation GCSE) frequently struggle with negative integers; "Proficient" (Higher GCSE) are generally reliable but make "silly" sign errors under pressure; "Advanced" (Grade 8/9 or A-Level) rarely make these errors.

**below_basic:** A=30% B=15% C=25% D=30%
*   *Reasoning: High guessing rate. Many will pick A or C simply because they aren't sure how to combine -5 and -7.*

**basic:** A=15% B=30% C=20% D=35%
*   *Reasoning: Option D is the "trap" here. Students at this level often correctly calculate the -12m but fail the directed number rule for the constant.*

**proficient:** A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
*   *Reasoning: Most understand the process. The majority of errors will be a momentary lapse in concentration resulting in Option D.*

**advanced:** A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
*   *Reasoning: These students have automated the process and rarely make sign errors on simple quadratic expansions.*
