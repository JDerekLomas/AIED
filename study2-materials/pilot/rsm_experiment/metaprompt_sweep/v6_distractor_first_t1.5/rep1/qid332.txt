As an experienced UK maths teacher, I encounter this specific type of two-step equation problem frequently. It tests the hierarchy of operations and the ability to apply inverse operations to an entire side of an equation versus a single term.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning for each option:

*   **A) Only Tom:** The student recognises that to isolate the $\frac{x}{3}$ term, they must apply the inverse of $-5$ by adding $5$ to both sides ($12+5=17$). This is the standard "order of operations in reverse" approach.
*   **B) Only Katie:** The student correctly identifies that they can multiply by $3$ to remove the denominator. However, they fail to realise that *every* term on both sides must be multiplied by $3$. They correctly multiply $\frac{x}{3}$ to get $x$ and $12$ to get $36$, but they forget to multiply the $-5$. This is a very common "partial multiplication" error.
*   **C) Both Tom and Katie:** The student correctly validates Tom's addition. They then look at Katie's work and see $x$ and $36$ ($12 \times 3$) and assume her method of "multiplying by the bottom" is valid without checking if the $-5$ was also scaled. This reflects a "half-rule" understanding where students remember to multiply the answer and the fraction, but ignore independent terms.
*   **D) Neither is correct:** The student likely makes a computational error (e.g., thinking Tom should have subtracted 5 to get 7) or fundamentally misunderstands the notation of the fraction.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

In the UK curriculum, "Below Basic" students often struggle with negative signs or inverse operations. "Basic" students usually master the first step (Tom) but fall for the Katie trap. "Proficient" students are starting to spot the "multiply everything" rule, and "Advanced" students can confidently manipulate equations in different orders.

**below_basic** (Year 7/8 students or foundation tier struggling learners): 
A=25% B=20% C=40% D=15%
*Reasoning: High "Both" selection because they see two people doing "maths-looking" things and assume there is more than one way to do it.*

**basic** (Working at GCSE Grade 3/4 level):
A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
*Reasoning: Most understand Tom is right, but a very large portion still believe Katie's "multiply by the denominator" shortcut is a valid move without distributing to the -5.*

**proficient** (Working at GCSE Grade 5/6 level):
A=80% B=5% C=12% D=3%
*Reasoning: The majority now recognise that Tom is correct. The common error here is still C, but many have been 'burned' by Katie's error in previous tests.*

**advanced** (Working at GCSE Grade 7+ or A-Level):
A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
*Reasoning: These students instinctively check the distribution of the 3 across the whole side ($x - 15 = 36$) and immediately dismiss Katie.*
