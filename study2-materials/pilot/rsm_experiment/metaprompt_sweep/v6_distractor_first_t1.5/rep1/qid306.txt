As a UK maths teacher, I frequently see these specific misconceptions when teaching Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). This question is a classic "trap" because it tests whether students understand that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and are solved left-to-right, whereas Multiplication must precede Addition.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

*   **A) Problem P: $4-5$; Problem Q: $4+5$**
    The student is following a "Left-to-Right" rule for everything, ignoring the hierarchy of operations. They treat mathematics like reading a sentence.
*   **B) Problem P: $4-5$; Problem Q: $5 \times 6$ (Correct)**
    The student correctly identifies that in Problem P, Addition and Subtraction have equal priority, so they work left-to-right. In Problem Q, they correctly identify that Multiplication must happen before Addition (BIDMAS).
*   **C) Problem P: $5+6$; Problem Q: $4+5$**
    This student has a rigid, literal interpretation of the acronym "BIDMAS" (where 'A' comes before 'S') combined with a left-to-right approach for Q, or perhaps a complete lack of operational priority understanding.
*   **D) Problem P: $5+6$; Problem Q: $5 \times 6$**
    This is the most common "sophisticated" error. The student knows BIDMAS and follows it strictly according to the letters: "A" comes before "S" in the acronym, so they think they *must* do $5+6$ before the subtraction in Problem P. However, they correctly prioritize multiplication in Problem Q.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK, **Below Basic** students often revert to left-to-right processing. **Basic** students have learned the BIDMAS acronym but often fall into the "A before S" trap. **Proficient** students are starting to grasp equal priority, and **Advanced** students understand the nuances perfectly.

**below_basic:** A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
*Reasoning: Mostly left-to-right (A). Some random guessing or basic acronym recognition.*

**basic:** A=25% B=30% C=5% D=40%
*Reasoning: High "A before S" trap (D) as they have just learned the acronym, alongside many who still default to left-to-right (A).*

**proficient:** A=10% B=60% C=2% D=28%
*Reasoning: Most have mastered the priority of multiplication, but a significant portion still gets caught out by the addition/subtraction priority in Problem P.*

**advanced:** A=2% B=92% C=1% D=5%
*Reasoning: High mastery, with only rare slips in concentration or over-thinking the "A" before "S" rule.*
