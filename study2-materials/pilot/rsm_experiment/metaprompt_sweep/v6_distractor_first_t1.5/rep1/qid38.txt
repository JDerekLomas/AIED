As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of algebraic fraction problem frequently in GCSE Foundation and Higher tiers. It tests the ability to find a common denominator rather than simply adding across.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

**A) $\frac{11}{2x}$ (Correct Reasoning)**
The student recognizes that the common denominator is $2x$. They leave the first fraction as it is and multiply both the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 2: $\frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{8}{2x}$. Adding the numerators gives $3 + 8 = 11$, and the denominator remains $2x$.

**B) $\frac{7}{3x}$ (The "Add Everything" Error)**
This is a classic misconception where students treat algebra like basic arithmetic gone wrong. They add the numerators ($3+4=7$) and add the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). This indicates a lack of understanding regarding common denominators.

**C) $\frac{11}{x}$ (The "Incomplete Balancing" Error)**
The student correctly identifies that they need to multiply $4$ by $2$ to get $11$, but they then decide the denominator should just be $x$, or they multiply the numerator of the second fraction but forget to treat the denominator $2x$ as a fixed entity.

**D) $\frac{7}{2x}$ (The "Fixed Denominator" Error)**
The student correctly identifies $2x$ as the common denominator but fails to adjust the numerator of the second fraction. They simply add the existing numerators ($3+4$) over the new denominator.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, **below_basic** correlates to Grade 1-2, **basic** to Grade 3-4, **proficient** to Grade 5-6, and **advanced** to Grade 7+.

**below_basic:** A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
*Reasoning: These students almost always add straight across (Option B) or pick the most "obvious" combination of the numbers seen.*

**basic:** A=35% B=25% C=10% D=30%
*Reasoning: Students here know they need a common denominator (often picking $2x$), but half will forget to scale the numerator of the second fraction (Option D).*

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
*Reasoning: Most have mastered the "multiply the top and bottom" rule. Errors usually come from rushing or simple arithmetic slips.*

**advanced:** A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
*Reasoning: High-ability GCSE students should find this trivial. Mistakes are rare and usually down to extreme "exam-brain" lapses.*
