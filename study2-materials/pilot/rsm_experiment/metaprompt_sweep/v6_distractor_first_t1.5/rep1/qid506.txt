As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in GCSE Foundation and higher-tier entry papers. It tests the student's ability to manipulate fractions and apply inverse operations correctly.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

**A) $p = \frac{1}{4}$**
The student recognizes they need to "do something with the 3 and the 12." They see 3 and 12 and perform $12 \div 3$, but they place the result in the denominator of a fraction because the original right-hand side was a fraction. They have essentially divided the 12 by 3 instead of dividing the whole side by 3.

**B) $p = \frac{1}{36}$ (Correct)**
The student correctly applies the inverse operation. To solve $3p$, they divide both sides by 3. They correctly calculate $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$, which is $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$.

**C) $p = 4$**
The student ignores the fraction structure entirely or "moves" the 12. They often multiply 3 by $p$ and somehow resolve the equation as $12 \div 3 = 4$, treating the $1/12$ as a 12 or simply grasping for a whole number result that feels "right" given the numbers 3 and 12.

**D) $p = \frac{1}{9}$**
The student mistakenly thinks they should subtract 3 from the 12 (associating $12 - 3 = 9$) or they are attempting to square/manipulate the 3 incorrectly. More commonly, this is a "near-miss" calculation error where they miscall a multiplication fact.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK context, "Below Basic" refers to students struggling with Level 1-2 functional skills; "Basic" refers to Grade 3 (GCSE); "Proficient" refers to Grade 5-6; and "Advanced" refers to Grade 8-9.

*Note: Percentages reflect the likelihood of a student in that bracket selecting the answer under timed conditions.*

**below_basic:** A=40% B=15% C=35% D=10%
*Reasoning: These students will focus on the integers 3 and 12. Option C is very attractive as it "cleans up" the fraction into a whole number.*

**basic:** A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
*Reasoning: Students at this level know they should divide, but they will intuitively divide the denominator (12) by 3 rather than multiplying it, leading them straight to A.*

**proficient:** A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
*Reasoning: Most students here understand the reciprocal nature of division but A remains a common "reflex" error if they are rushing.*

**advanced:** A=5% B=94% C=0% D=1%
*Reasoning: These students have mastered the manipulation of fractions and algebraic inverses. Errors here are almost exclusively due to clerical slips.*
