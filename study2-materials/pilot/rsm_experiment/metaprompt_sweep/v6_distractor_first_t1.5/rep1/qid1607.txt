As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of linear equation mistake frequently. It highlights a student's misunderstanding of **inverse operations** and how to "undo" a calculation to isolate a variable.

### Step 1 — Analysis of Reasoning

*   **A) Only step 1:** The student correctly identifies that they need to multiply by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$) to undo the division. They then recognize that in Step 2, Isaac made an error by adding 1 instead of subtracting 1 ($60 - 1 = 59$). This is the **correct mathematical reasoning.**
*   **B) Only step 2:** The student likely lacks "structural sense." They might believe Step 1 is wrong (perhaps thinking they should subtract 4 first) but see Step 2 as "logically" following an addition rule ($60 + 1 = 61$) without verifying the validity of the first move. This is a rare choice.
*   **C) Both steps are correct:** The student understands the first step ($15 \times 4$) but has a common misconception regarding signs. They see $+1$ and instinctively think the next step should be "plus 1" to get 61, rather than using the inverse operation (subtraction). They are focusing on the numbers rather than the balance of the equation.
*   **D) Both steps are incorrect:** The student fails to recognize that multiplying by the denominator is a valid first step. They may think you must subtract 1 first (a common error when the fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol) or they may have performed the multiplication $15 \times 4$ incorrectly in their head.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, these "ability levels" roughly correlate to Foundation Tier (Below Basic/Basic) and Higher Tier (Proficient/Advanced) GCSE students.

**below_basic**
*Students at this level often struggle with the concept of inverse operations and frequently guess based on what "looks" like maths.*
A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%

**basic**
*These students can usually perform one-step calculations but often fall into the "operation sign trap." They recognize $15 \times 4 = 60$, so they trust the process up to Step 1, but fail to spot the sign error in Step 2.*
A=30% B=5% C=55% D=10%

**proficient**
*Students here are generally comfortable with two-step equations. Most will spot the error in Step 2 immediately. Some may still rush and choose C, but the majority will identify that only the first step followed the rules of algebra.*
A=75% B=2% C=18% D=5%

**advanced**
*These students have high fluency and often "solve" the equation in their head before looking at the steps. They will quickly identify that $k$ should be 59 and therefore see that Step 2 is an addition error.*
A=95% B=0% C=3% D=2%
