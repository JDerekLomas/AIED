As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific problem frequently when teaching Year 8 and Year 9 (Key Stage 3) or Foundation GCSE students. It tests the intersection of two distinct concepts: **multiplicative inverses (reciprocals)** and **directed number rules (signs)**.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) $\frac{4}{3}$:** This is the **correct answer**. The student understands that to get a product of $1$, they must multiply by the reciprocal. They also correctly apply the rule that a negative multiplied by a positive results in a negative ($- \times + = -$).
*   **B) $-\frac{4}{3}$:** This is a **sign error**. The student knows the reciprocal is needed to reach a magnitude of $1$, but they believe that since the result is negative, the multiplier must also be negative. They have forgotten that a negative times a negative equals a positive ($(-)\times(-) = +$).
*   **C) $\frac{3}{4}$:** This is a **conceptual "identity" error**. The student sees the number $1$ and thinks of identity properties, simply changing the sign to make it positive without accounting for the multiplication required to change the value.
*   **D) $-\frac{3}{4}$:** This is a **visual/procedural error**. The student may be thinking of addition (where $-\frac{3}{4} + -\frac{1}{4} = -1$) or simply repeating the value in the question because they are overwhelmed by the fraction and the negative sign.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

The primary "distractor" in this problem is Option B. In my experience, even relatively strong students often reflexively pick the same sign as the target answer.

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Sign Error) | C (Value Error) | D (Random/Repetition) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 35% | 25% | 25% |
| **Basic** | 30% | 45% | 15% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 65% | 25% | 5% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 92% | 7% | 1% | 0% |

#### Teacher’s Commentary:
*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level struggle with fractions and negative signs simultaneously. They often guess based on what "looks right," frequently choosing B because the answer is negative, or C/D because they recognize the digits.
*   **Basic:** These students often know the "flip the fraction" rule but have a "surface-level" understanding of negative numbers. They will disproportionately pick B because they associate a negative answer with needing negative components.
*   **Proficient:** Most students here have mastered the reciprocal and are starting to slow down to check their signs. The 25% choosing B represents "silly mistakes" made under time pressure.
*   **Advanced:** Students at this level automatically check the sign parity ($-\times+ = -$) and will likely solve this in under 5 seconds with high accuracy.
