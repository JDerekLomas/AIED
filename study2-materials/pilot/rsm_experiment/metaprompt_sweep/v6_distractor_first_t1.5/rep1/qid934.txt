As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this type of substitution question frequently in Foundation Tier GCSE and Key Stage 3 assessments. The primary challenge here is that the equation is presented in an implicit form ($ax + by = c$) rather than the explicit form ($y = mx + c$), which tests both substitution and basic algebraic rearrangement.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) 20:** The student performs a "pseudo-operation" by multiplying the coefficients in the equation (4 and 2) and the result (10), or more likely, adds 10 to itself twice because of the "$2y$". Another common path is treating $4(0) + 2y = 10$ as $40 + 2y = 10$, then making a series of calculation errors.
*   **B) 3:** This is the result of a "term confusion" or "sign error." A student might correctly substitute $x=0$ to get $2y=10$, but then mistakenly think they need to subtract 4 (the coefficient of $x$) from 10 to get $2y=6$, and finally $y=3$. 
*   **C) 5:** **Correct Reasoning.** The student substitutes $x=0$ into the equation: $4(0) + 2y = 10$. This simplifies to $0 + 2y = 10$, therefore $2y = 10$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $y = 5$.
*   **D) 2.5:** The student confuses the coefficients or ignores the $x$ term entirely, simply dividing the constant 10 by the coefficient 4 ($10 \div 4 = 2.5$). This is common for students who have memorized "divide the big number by the first number" without understanding the variable relationship.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

**Level Definitions:**
*   **Below Basic:** Struggling with basic substitution and the concept of an equals sign.
*   **Basic:** Can substitute but struggles with two-step equations or inverse operations.
*   **Proficient:** Comfortable with substitution and simple linear equations.
*   **Advanced:** Masters algebra and recognizes the $y$-intercept property ($x=0$) instantly.

| Ability Level | A (20) | B (3) | C (5) | D (2.5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 35% | 15% | 20% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 10% | 25% | 45% | 20% |
| **Proficient** | 2% | 8% | 85% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 0% | 1% | 98% | 1% |

**Teacher's Note:** Option C is a "high-success" question for proficient students because $x=0$ eliminates the need to handle the $4x$ term. The most common "good" mistake is Option B, as students often feel they must "do something" with every number visible in the equation.
