As an experienced teacher, I see this specific question as a diagnostic of two distinct concepts: understanding that the FOIL/grid method requires **multiplication** (not addition), and the mastery of **directed number rules** (specifically that a negative times a negative equals a positive).

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) +4:** This is the **correct reasoning**. The student identifies that they must multiply $-1$ and $-4$. They correctly apply the rule that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive ($1 \times 4 = 4$).
*   **B) -4:** The student correctly identifies that multiplication is required, but they have a **misconception regarding directed numbers**. They likely believe that "a minus and a minus stay minus" (confusing addition rules with multiplication rules) or simply forget to multiply the signs.
*   **C) +5:** The student understands that the signs should result in a positive, but they have made a **procedural error by adding** the terms instead of multiplying them ($1 + 4 = 5$ or thinking $(-1) + (-4)$ and then incorrectly adjusting the sign). 
*   **D) -5:** The student has a **procedural error combined with a sign error**. They have added the two numbers $(-1) + (-4) = -5$ instead of multiplying them. This is a very common error for students who are new to expanding brackets and confuse the process with simplifying expressions.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

I have categorized students into four UK-aligned attainment levels:
*   **Below Basic:** Working significantly below age-related expectations (KS2/Functional Skills Level).
*   **Basic:** Target Grade 3/Low 4. Understands the concept of brackets but struggles with negatives.
*   **Proficient:** Target Grade 5/6. Consistent with procedures but prone to "slip-ups" under pressure.
*   **Advanced:** Target Grade 7+. Mastery of directed numbers and algebraic manipulation.

| Level | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **below_basic** | 15% | 25% | 20% | 40% |
| **basic** | 45% | 25% | 10% | 20% |
| **proficient** | 80% | 12% | 3% | 5% |
| **advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0% | 1% |

**Teacher's Note on the Data:**
At the **Below Basic** level, option **D** is often the most popular choice because students default to "combining" the numbers via addition if they aren't confident in the distributive law. As ability increases, the error moves from a procedural one (adding vs. multiplying) to a sign error (A vs. B). By the **Advanced** level, anything other than A is usually just a clerical "reading the question too fast" error.
