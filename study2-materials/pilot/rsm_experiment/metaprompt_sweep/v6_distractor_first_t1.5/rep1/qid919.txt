As a UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in Foundation and Higher tier GCSE papers. It tests two distinct skills: understanding the order of operations (BIDMAS) and decimal arithmetic (specifically squaring decimals).

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

*   **A) 0.81**: The student has incorrectly applied the exponent to the product of 3 and $x$. They calculated $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$. This is a common **order of operations** error.
*   **B) 0.27**: **This is the correct answer.** The student correctly followed BIDMAS: $0.3^2 = 0.09$, then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.
*   **C) 1.8**: The student has confused "squaring" with "multiplying by 2". They calculated $3 \times (0.3 \times 2) = 3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$.
*   **D) 2.7**: The student correctly identified that $3^2 = 9$ and $0.3^2$ should involve a 9, but they made a **place value error** when squaring the decimal, believing $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. They then calculated $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK system, **below_basic** students often struggle with the concept of a square number, while **basic** (Grade 3/4) students struggle with the decimal placement. **Proficient** (Grade 5/6) students occasionally fall for the BIDMAS trap (Option A), and **advanced** (Grade 7+) students usually navigate both hurdles easily.

*   **below_basic:** A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%
    *(Most will default to multiplying by 2 (Option C) or just guess using the digits provided.)*
*   **basic:** A=25% B=30% C=15% D=30%
    *(The struggle here is split between the order of operations and the decimal place value error in Option D.)*
*   **proficient:** A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
    *(Most understand $0.3^2 = 0.09$, but a significant minority will still calculate $(3x)^2$ by mistake.)*
*   **advanced:** A=5% B=92% C=1% D=2%
    *(High achievers rarely miss the BIDMAS rule, though a "silly" mental arithmetic error on the decimal is possible.)*
