As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen hundreds of students tackle adding mixed numbers. The common pitfalls usually involve "fractional drift"—where students apply rules of integer addition incorrectly to denominators—or failing to read the final instruction regarding the format of the answer.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

**A) Correct Reasoning:** The student adds the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and the numerators ($1 + 2 = 3$) while correctly identifying that the common denominator ($5$) remains unchanged. They also correctly followed the instruction to provide a mixed number.

**B) Conversion Error/Instruction Neglect:** The student correctly calculates the sum as $3 \frac{3}{5}$ but converts it to an improper fraction ($3 \times 5 + 3 = 18$). While mathematically equivalent, they ignored the specific instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."

**C) Double Error (The "Add Everything" approach):** This student treats the fraction like a series of independent integers. They add the numerators ($1 + 2 = 3$) and the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$), and then likely ignored the whole numbers or became confused, eventually just picking a value that "looked" like the numbers in the question. $\frac{18}{10}$ is often a result of converting to improper fractions first and adding both tops and bottoms.

**D) The Common Misconception:** The student correctly adds the whole numbers ($2+1=3$) and numerators ($1+2=3$), but mistakenly believes that the denominators must also be added ($5+5=10$). This is the most common error in fraction addition at Key Stage 3.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum (Years 7–9), adding fractions with common denominators is a fundamental skill, but "adding the bottoms" remains a stubborn misconception for lower-ability sets.

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Improper) | C (Random/Erroneous) | D (Add Denoms) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 25% | 10% | 25% | 40% |
| **Basic** | 50% | 10% | 10% | 30% |
| **Proficient** | 80% | 10% | 2% | 8% |
| **Advanced** | 95% | 4% | 0% | 1% |

**Teacher's Commentary on Distributions:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level often treat numerators and denominators as four separate whole numbers to be combined. Option D is a very "attractive distractor" because $5+5=10$ feels intuitively correct to a struggling learner.
*   **Basic:** These students usually know to add the whole numbers, but about a third of them will still lapse into adding the denominators (Option D) under pressure.
*   **Proficient:** These students have mastered the algorithm but occasionally lose marks on Option B by over-complicating the answer (converting to improper) or not reading the final line of the prompt.
*   **Advanced:** Almost all students will get this right. The small percentage for Option B represents the "speed trap" error of not reading the formatting instruction.
