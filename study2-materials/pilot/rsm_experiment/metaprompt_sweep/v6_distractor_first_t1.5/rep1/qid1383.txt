As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently in Foundation and Higher tier GCSE papers. It tests two distinct skills: the priority of operations (BIDMAS) and the rules of directed numbers (multiplying negatives).

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) 81 (Correct):** The student understands that $(-3)^4 = -3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3$. They correctly identify that an even power of a negative number results in a positive product (e.g., $9 \times 9 = 81$).
*   **B) 12:** This is a common operational error where the student multiplies the base by the index ($k \times 4$). They also ignore the negative sign or assume it vanishes.
*   **C) -81:** The student correctly calculates $3^4 = 81$ but fails to apply the rules of multiplying negatives correctly, or they are mimicking a calculator error where typing $-3^4$ without brackets yields $-81$ due to BIDMAS (applying the power before the negation).
*   **D) -12:** A combination of two errors: multiplying the base by the index ($3 \times 4$) and then re-attaching the negative sign.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions:

In the UK system, **Below Basic** (Grade 1-2) students struggle with the concept of indices, often treating them as multipliers. **Basic** (Grade 3-4) students know how indices work but frequently trip up on negative number rules. **Proficient** (Grade 5-6) students are consistent with calculations but can be led astray by "calculator logic." **Advanced** (Grade 7+) students rarely make these mistakes unless rushing.

| Ability Level | A (81) | B (12) | C (-81) | D (-12) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 35% | 10% | 40% |
| **Basic** | 40% | 15% | 30% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 70% | 5% | 20% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 95% | 1% | 4% | 0% |

**Teacher's Note:** Option **C** is the "distractor of death" for mid-to-high ability students. Many students who understand indices will still write $-81$ because they have been conditioned by their scientific calculators, which require brackets around the $-3$ to give the correct result for $(-3)^4$. Without brackets, the calculator follows BIDMAS and does $-(3^4)$.
