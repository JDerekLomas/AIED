As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle fraction arithmetic. This specific question tests three distinct skills: finding a common denominator, performing the addition, and following the final formatting instruction (mixed number).

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) \( \frac{99}{20} \)**: This is the **mathematically correct value** but in the **wrong format**. The student correctly found the common denominator of 20 (\( \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} \)) but ignored the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
*   **B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \)**: This is the **correct answer**. The student added the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and the fractions using a common denominator of 20 (\( \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20} \)).
*   **C) \( \frac{99}{40} \)**: This represents a **common calculation error** where the student correctly multiplies the numerators/denominators to find equivalents but then **adds the denominators** as well as the numerators (\( \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{40} \)).
*   **D) \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \)**: This is the **classic "add across" error**. The student added the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), then added the numerators ($7+1=8$) and the denominators ($10+4=14$). This is the most common misconception among lower-ability students.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, we often see a "U-shaped" distribution of errors. Lower-ability students stick to "adding across," while middle-to-high ability students often lose marks by failing to convert back to a mixed number.

*   **Below Basic** (Working towards KS3 Level 3/4): These students usually do not understand that a common denominator is required.
*   **Basic** (GCSE Grade 1–2): These students know a common denominator is needed but often make arithmetic slips or add the denominators once they have found them.
*   **Proficient** (GCSE Grade 3–5): These students can perform the operation but frequently miss the secondary instruction regarding the "mixed number" format.
*   **Advanced** (GCSE Grade 6+): These students read the full question and execute the multi-step process accurately.

| Ability Level | A (Improper) | B (Correct) | C (Add Denoms) | D (Add Across) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 5% | 10% | 15% | **70%** |
| **Basic** | 20% | 30% | **35%** | 15% |
| **Proficient** | **40%** | 50% | 5% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | **95%** | 0% | 0% |

**Teacher's Note:** Option A is the biggest "trap" for higher-tier students who work quickly. Under exam pressure, many calculate $\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$ and stop there, feeling satisfied that they found the number, without re-reading the prompt.
