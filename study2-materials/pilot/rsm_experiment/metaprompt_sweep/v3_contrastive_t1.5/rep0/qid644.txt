As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've observed that this specific question highlights the common confusion between multiplication rules and addition rules when dealing with directed numbers.

While many students are taught "minus and a minus makes a plus," those at the lower end of the ability spectrum often revert to addition when they see two negative signs, leading them to $-5$ (as if they were calculating $-1 - 4$). The "timesing" vs "adding" error is particularly prevalent when students are in the middle of a multi-step process like FOIL or the grid method.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

**below_basic:** A=35% B=15% C=10% D=40%
Students at this level often treat the two numbers as an addition/subtraction problem ($ -1 - 4 = -5$) or forget the sign rules entirely.

**basic:** A=55% B=15% C=5% D=25%
Students at this level generally remember they need to multiply ($1 \times 4 = 4$), but many still struggle with the sign rule, either thinking the negatives stay negative or reverting to addition logic ($D$).

**proficient:** A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
Most proficient students handle the multiplication and the sign rule correctly. The main error here is a "slip" where the student forgets the second minus sign and chooses $B$.

**advanced:** A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
High-performing students rarely miss this specific sub-step of expanding brackets, as negative integer multiplication is deeply embedded.

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=55% B=15% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=02% D=03%
advanced: A=98% B=01% C=00% D=01%
