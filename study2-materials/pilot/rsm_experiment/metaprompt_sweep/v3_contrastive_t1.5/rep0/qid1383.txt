This question tests two distinct areas: the understanding of negative bases with even exponents and the common confusion between exponents and multiplication.

The primary "trap" here is whether the student applies the fourth power correctly to a negative number. At lower ability levels, the "additive/multiplicative" error (treating $k^4$ as $k \times 4$) is extremely common, leading to $12$ or $-12$. At the mid-tier, students know to multiply $3$ four times, but many believe that if the input is negative, the output must also be negative, regardless of whether the power is even or odd. This makes option C a very strong distractor for "Basic" and "Proficient" students.
