This question is significantly easier than many mixed number addition problems because it does not require finding a common denominator, nor does it involve "crossing the whole" (where the sum of the fractions exceeds 1). These are the two primary hurdles for students in this topic.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A (Correct):** Most students will simply add the integers ($2+1=3$) and the numerators ($1+2=3$).
*   **B (Improper Fraction):** This is the correct value but ignores the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number." It is a common mistake for higher-ability students who follow a "convert to improper first" method and forget to convert back.
*   **C (Adding everything):** Students add integers, numerators, and denominators. This reflects a very low understanding of fractions.
*   **D (Adding denominators):** A very common misconception where students correctly add integers and numerators but think $5+5=10$ for the denominator.
