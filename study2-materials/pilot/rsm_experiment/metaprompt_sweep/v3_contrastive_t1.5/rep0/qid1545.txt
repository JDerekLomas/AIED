This question tests the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). While it looks straightforward, it contains a classic "left-to-right" trap. Students who ignore the order of operations and simply work from left to right will calculate $8+12=20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$, leading them to conclude both sides are equal (Option C).

The correct calculation for the left side is $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$. The right side is $(8+12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$. Since $11 > 5$, the answer is A. 

Lower-ability students often default to reading math like a sentence (left-to-right). This specific question is highly effective at triggering that error because the numbers ($8+12$) are identical on both sides, making "C" a very "common sense" looking answer for those not strictly applying BIDMAS. Advanced students will spot the difference instantly, but even proficient students sometimes rush and fall for the visual symmetry.
