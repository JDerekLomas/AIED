This quadratic expansion question targets two primary areas of potential error: the sum of two negative numbers ($-5 - 7$) and the product of two negative numbers ($-5 \times -7$).

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **The Middle Term:** Students often confuse $-5 - 7$. Option A ($m^2 - 2m - 35$) is the classic "difference" trap where students subtract the numbers instead of summing their negative values. 
*   **The Constant Term:** The "negative $\times$ negative = positive" rule is the most common pitfall here. Option D is a very strong distractor because it gets the $-12m$ correct but fails on the sign of the 35. Option C is chosen by those who lose track of signs entirely but know the "numbers" involved are 12 and 35.
*   **Difficulty level:** This is a mid-tier expansion. Having two negatives is significantly harder for "Basic" students than one positive and one negative.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=75% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
