In this equation-solving problem, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4 to get $60 = 1 + k$), but Step 2 contains a common directional error. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$, the student has added 1, resulting in 61.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **Step 1** is a common hurdle, but because 15 and 4 are "friendly" numbers, many students will correctly identify that $15 \times 4 = 60$.
*   **Step 2** is the classic "change the side, change the sign" trap. Students often see the $+1$ and instinctively add it to the other side because they are used to the sum increasing, or they simply perform the inverse operation incorrectly.
*   **Below Basic** students often struggle to identify where the first error occurred and may assume both are correct if the numbers "look" right, or choose D if they are overwhelmed.
*   **Basic/Proficient** students are the most likely to choose **C**. They understand the first step but often miss the subtle sign error in the second step, viewing $60+1=61$ as a logical progression.
*   **Advanced** students will check the solution ($k=61$) against the original equation ($62/4 \neq 15$) and identify that only the first step was mathematically sound.
