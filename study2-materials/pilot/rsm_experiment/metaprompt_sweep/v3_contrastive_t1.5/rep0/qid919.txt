This question specifically tests the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) combined with decimal place value—two areas where UK students frequently stumble.

The most significant distractor here is **A (0.81)**. Students often correctly identify that they should square $3x$, calculating $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$, mistakenly applying the multiplication before the power. 

**C (1.8)** represents the common error of doubling instead of squaring ($3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$), while **B (0.27)** and **D (2.7)** test the handling of the decimal point when squaring $0.3$. Because $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$ is a non-intuitive result for many (who expect $0.9$), option D is a very strong distractor for those who know the order of operations but struggle with decimal arithmetic.
