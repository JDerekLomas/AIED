To answer this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$. 
The calculation is: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$.

**Analysis of difficulties:**
1.  **Operation confusion:** A common error is incorrectly handling the subtraction. Students often add 3 to 30 to get 33 (correct), but those who struggle with inverse operations might subtract 3 from 30 to get 27, leading to $x=2.7$ (Option D).
2.  **Substitution error:** Some students accidentally substitute $0.5$ for $x$ instead of $y$. If $x=0.5$, then $5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y = -4.16$, which isn't an option, but the presence of $4.25$ (Option A) acts as a distractor for those who guess based on "looks like a calculation result."
3.  **The $6y$ term:** Students often struggle with $6 \times 0.5$. While simple, those below basic ability may think it is $6.5$ or simply $6$.

Option C is the correct answer. Option D is the most common "logical" error (incorrect inverse operation). Option A is a common "calculated guess" for students who get lost in the decimals.
