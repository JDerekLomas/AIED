To solve $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator (which is $2x$). This requires multiplying the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by $2$, resulting in $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

**Analysis of misconceptions:**
*   **Option A (Correct):** Students recognize they need a common denominator and correctly scale the numerator of the second fraction.
*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** This is the most common "freshman's dream" error. Students add the numerators ($3+4$) and add the denominators ($2x+x$).
*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** Students identify $2x$ as the common denominator but forget to adjust the second numerator ($3+4$), or they mistakenly think that because the $x$ is already there, they only need to add the numbers.
*   **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** Students correctly find $11$ but get confused with the denominator logic, perhaps thinking they need to cancel the $2$.

This question is a significant hurdle for basic and below-basic students because it combines algebraic fractions with non-equal denominators. The presence of the "$2$" in only one fraction is a classic distractor that triggers "add the across" behavior.
