As an experienced UK maths teacher, I identify this question as a classic "fractional operation" trap within algebra. While the algebra itself is simple (dividing by 3), the execution involving a fraction causes significant friction for students.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **Option A ($1/4$):** This is the most common error. Students see '3' and '12' and intuitively think of the relationship $12 \div 3 = 4$. They often multiply the fraction by 3 ($3/12$) instead of dividing, or simply associate the numbers 3 and 12 with the result 4.
*   **Option B (Correct):** To solve $3p = 1/12$, you must divide by 3 (or multiply by $1/3$), giving $1/36$.
*   **Option C (4):** Students who ignore the fraction structure entirely and just perform $12 \div 3$.
*   **Option D ($1/9$):** A less common "guessing" error or a calculation error where students might try to square the 3 or misinterpret the denominator relationship.

**The Difficulty Spike:** 
Lower-ability students struggle with "sharing" a small fraction into more parts. Many believe that "division makes things smaller," but they lack the procedural fluency to realize that $1/36$ is smaller than $1/12$, leading them back to the "cleaner" looking $1/4$.
