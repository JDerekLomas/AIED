As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as one that tests "fractional fluency" more than basic algebraic manipulation. While the step to solve $3p = \frac{1}{12}$ is simply to divide by 3, many students struggle with the mechanics of dividing a unit fraction by an integer.

The most common trap is **Option A ($1/4$)**, where students mistakenly multiply $1/12$ by $3$ (confusing the inverse operation or thinking $12 \div 3 = 4$). **Option C ($4$)** is common for lower-ability students who ignore the fractional nature entirely and simply divide $12$ by $3$. **Option D ($1/9$)** is a rare error where students might replace the 12 with the 3 and then square or manipulate numbers incorrectly, but $1/36$ remains the specific target for those who understand they need to multiply the denominator.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
