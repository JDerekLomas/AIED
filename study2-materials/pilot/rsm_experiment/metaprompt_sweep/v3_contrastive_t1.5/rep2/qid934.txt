As a UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because it tests **linear equations in an implicit form ($ax + by = c$)** rather than the more common explicit form ($y = mx + c$).

**Teacher's Analysis:**
1.  **The "0" Factor:** Substituting $x = 0$ usually makes a question easier, as it eliminates the $4x$ term entirely. However, for "below basic" students, the presence of the coefficient $2$ in front of the $y$ still requires a division step ($2y = 10$) that many forget.
2.  **The Trap (Option C):** $C=5$ is the correct answer. The main distractor is not actually listed ($10$), but $5$ is easily reached by students who understand $2y=10$.
3.  **Misconception A (20):** This comes from students who see $4 \times 5 = 20$ or incorrectly try to multiply the constants.
4.  **Misconception B (3):** This often comes from students who confuse the equation with $4+2=6$ and $10-4=6 \rightarrow 6/2=3$, or common "number bond" guessing.
5.  **Misconception D (2.5):** This is a high-level distractor for students who perform $10 \div 4$ instead of looking at the $y$ coefficient.

Despite being an implicit equation, the $x=0$ substitution is a fundamental skill that many "Proficient" and "Advanced" students will find trivial. The struggle remains primarily at the "Basic" level where rearranging even simple equations is a barrier.
