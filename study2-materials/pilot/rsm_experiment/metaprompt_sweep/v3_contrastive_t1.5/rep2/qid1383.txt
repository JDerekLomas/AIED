This question specifically tests two potential pitfalls: the application of an index to a negative base and the distinction between multiplication by the index versus exponentiation.

For many lower-ability students, the most common error is the "multiplication trap" ($3 \times 4$ or $-3 \times 4$), leading to answers of $12$ or $-12$. For middle-ability students, the calculation $3^4 = 81$ is usually performed correctly, but the negative sign remains a significant hurdle. Many students remember that "negatives stay negative" or fail to apply the rule that an even power of a negative number results in a positive product.

However, because $3^4$ is a relatively common power in the UK GCSE curriculum, proficient and advanced students generally recognize that $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$ results in $+81$.
