This question is a classic test of "order of operations" in reverse when solving linear equations.

Tom is correct because he adds 5 to both sides first: $\frac{x}{3} = 12 + 5$.
Katie is **incorrect**. She has tried to multiply by 3, but she has failed to multiply the $-5$ term by 3. A correct version of her step would be $x - 15 = 36$.

**Analysis of Difficulty:**
*   **Tom's method** follows the standard "BIDMAS in reverse" (Flowchart method) taught in UK schools, making it highly intuitive for students.
*   **Katie's error** is one of the most common mistakes in GCSE algebra: multiplying one term but not all terms when clearing a fraction. 
*   **The Trap:** Because Katie's result ($x-5=36$) looks "cleaner" and mathematically plausible to a student who struggles with the distributive property, many mid-to-low ability students will assume both methods are valid ways to start. Only higher-tier students consistently spot that every term must be multiplied.
