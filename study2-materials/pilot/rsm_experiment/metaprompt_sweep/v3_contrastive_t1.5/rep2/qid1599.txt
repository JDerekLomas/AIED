This question tests a student's ability to translate division into fraction notation, specifically dealing with a binomial divisor. 

The primary difficulty here is not the concept of division as a fraction (which most students learn early), but rather the **preservation of the grouping**. The presence of the brackets in the original expression \( c \div (h+4) \) is a strong visual cue. Students who struggle with BIDMAS/order of operations may be tempted by **Option C**, effectively "distributing" the division or ignoring the brackets. **Option D** is a common "reversal" error where students know division becomes a fraction but forget which term is the numerator and which is the denominator. **Option B** is a distractor for students who reflexively think all parts of the expression must be modified by the variable.

However, because the brackets are explicitly written in the question, this makes the correct answer (A) more intuitive than if the question were a word problem.
