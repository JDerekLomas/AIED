This question tests a student's ability to rearrange a formula involving a fraction, a power, and the constant $\pi$. While the formula for the volume of a sphere ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) is usually provided in formulae sheets or memorised, the algebraic manipulation required to isolate $r$ is a common sticking point.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **Option C (Correct):** To isolate $r^3$, students must multiply by 3 and divide by $4\pi$.
*   **Option A:** A very common error where students multiply the terms they should divide by (confusing the inverse operations).
*   **Option B:** Students often correctly move the $\pi$ and the 3 but "flip" the fraction the wrong way or fail to group $4\pi$ together in the denominator.
*   **Option D:** This represents a failure to understand that the cube root applies to the entire expression, not just the $V$, and shows a weak grasp of the coefficient $4/3$.

**Performance Prediction:**
At the **below_basic** level, students often struggle to remember the sphere formula at all or pick an option that "looks right" (often choosing A because they prefer multiplication over division). **Basic** students often get the $3$ and $4$ the right way round but forget where $\pi$ goes. **Proficient** students generally reach the correct answer but a significant minority will miss the grouping of $4\pi$ in the denominator. **Advanced** students should find this trivial.

basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=15% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=4% C=94% D=1%
