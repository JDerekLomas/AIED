As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question by looking at the specific interaction between the two terms: $-1$ and $-4$. 

This question targets two common misconceptions:
1. **The Additive Error:** Students who confuse multiplication with addition (or "combining") terms. This leads them to see $-1$ and $-4$ and arrive at $-5$.
2. **The Sign Error:** Students who know to multiply $1 \times 4$ but forget that a "negative times a negative equals a positive."

For **Below Basic** students, the most common pitfall is the additive error ($D$). These students see the two numbers and mentally process them as a sum. **Basic** students often move past the additive error but get tripped up by the sign rule, making $B$ a very popular distractor. **Proficient** students generally know the rules but can still make a "slip" under pressure. **Advanced** students should find this trivial.

The "Specific" difficulty here is that $-1$ is a "weak" multiplier; students sometimes treat it as a sign change or an operation rather than a value, which increases the likelihood of the additive error compared to if the numbers were, say, $-2$ and $-3$.

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=5% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
