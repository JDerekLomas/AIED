As an experienced teacher, I've seen this specific algebraic fraction problem many times. It is a classic "common denominator" question, but the relative simplicity of the denominators ($2x$ and $x$) creates specific traps.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **Option A (Correct):** To solve this, students must recognise the common denominator is $2x$. They multiply $\frac{4}{x}$ by $\frac{2}{2}$ to get $\frac{8}{2x}$, then add: $3+8 = 11$.
*   **Option D (The most common error):** Students simply add the numerators ($3+4=7$) while keeping the more "complex" looking denominator ($2x$). This is a very common shortcut taken by students who don't fully grasp the need for equivalent fractions.
*   **Option B:** This represents the "add the tops, add the bottoms" misconception ($\frac{3+4}{2x+x} = \frac{7}{3x}$). While a common error in lower years, by the time students encounter algebraic fractions, many have been drilled out of this, though it persists at below_basic levels.
*   **Option C:** This occurs if a student attempts to use $x$ as the common denominator but incorrectly "halves" the first term or simply ignores the 2.

**Difficulty assessment:** This is a medium-difficulty question. The fact that one denominator is a multiple of the other makes it easier than questions requiring a cross-multiplication of denominators (like $2x$ and $3x$), but the "7" in Option D is a very strong distractor for those working quickly.
