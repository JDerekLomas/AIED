As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on common Key Stage 3 and GCSE student behaviours.

This question tests three distinct skills: common denominators, adding mixed numbers, and reading the final instruction ("Leave your answer as a mixed number").

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **B is the correct answer.**
*   **D represents the classic "Add the Tops, Add the Bottoms" misconception** ($2+2=4, 7+1=8, 10+4=14$). This is the most common error for low-ability students.
*   **A is the correct value but in the wrong format** (Improper fraction). Advanced students rarely fall for this, but proficient students moving too quickly often forget to convert back.
*   **C is a calculation error** often resulting from multiplying the denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but failing to adjust the numerators correctly, or simply a "guess" based on the numbers appearing in the prompt.

**Student Behaviour Patterns:**
*   **Below Basic:** Almost exclusively choose D. They see addition and apply it to every number they see.
*   **Basic:** Split between attempting a common denominator (and often getting 40) and choosing D. They struggle to convert back to mixed numbers.
*   **Proficient:** Usually find the common denominator of 20 correctly. The main pitfall here is Option A; students calculate $47/20 + 45/20 = 99/20$ (if using the improper fraction method) and forget to convert back as requested.
*   **Advanced:** Will identify B almost immediately. They are trained to look for the "Mixed Number" instruction and will likely add the whole numbers and fractions separately ($4 + 14/20 + 5/20$).

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=97% C=1% D=0%
