To solve this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$.
The calculation is: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$.

**Analysis of student performance:**
*   **The Trap (Option D):** Many students struggle with the negative sign. A common error is calculating $10x + 3 = 30$, leading to $10x = 27$ and $x = 2.7$. This is a high-frequency mistake for "basic" and "below basic" students.
*   **The Trap (Option A):** Some students mistake which variable to substitute or mismanage the $6y$ term entirely. For instance, $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$ leads to $5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y \approx -4.16$ (often rounded or guessed as 4.25).
*   **Proficiency:** This is a mid-tier difficulty question because $y$ is a decimal (0.5), and the equation is in the form $ax - by = c$. Most proficient students will manage the substitution and the two-step equation correctly.
