In this equation, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4 to get $60 = 1 + k$). However, Step 2 is incorrect because Isaac added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting it to isolate $k$. The correct Step 2 should be $k = 59$.

This is a classic "balance" error. Students who are **below basic** often see the $+1$ and instinctively add $1$ to the other side to "put the numbers together," or they guess blindly because they find multi-step equations intimidating. **Basic** level students usually recognise that Step 1 is correct, but they often fall into the trap of Step 2 because they are prone to operation-sign errors when moving terms across the equals sign. **Proficient** students are generally good at spotting inverse operations but might rush and misidentify Step 2 as correct if they aren't looking closely. **Advanced** students will solve the equation mentally in seconds and immediately spot that Step 2 results in an incorrect solution ($15 = 62/4$ is clearly wrong).
