As a UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because it targets three distinct procedural "trap" areas: the treatment of zero as a value, the visual representation of division (fractions vs. BODMAS), and the count of the denominator.

**Key insights for this question:**
1.  **The "Zero" Misconception:** Lower-ability students often feel that zero "doesn't count." This leads them to divide by 4 instead of 5 (Option C).
2.  **The Calculation Formatting:** Option B is a classic BODMAS/order of operations trap. Without brackets, $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$ actually means $15 + 1.4$. Only advanced students usually spot that B is mathematically incorrect due to the lack of parentheses.
3.  **Option A vs. B:** Option A is mathematically correct because the fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol. However, it looks "wrong" to some students because the 0 is missing from the numerator, even though adding 0 doesn't change the sum.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=45% D=5%
*Lower-ability students often discount the 0 entirely, leading them to Option C. Those who remember "add them all up and divide by how many there are" often pick B because it's written in a straight line, ignoring BIDMAS.*

basic: A=35% B=25% C=30% D=10%
*These students are split. Many will see that Option A has a denominator of 5 and recognise it as the "safest" choice, even if the 0 is missing. However, a significant portion will still fall for the "divide by 4" trap because of the four non-zero digits.*

proficient: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
*Proficient students usually understand that the 0 must be included in the count (denominator = 5), ruling out C. Most will choose A, identifying the fraction bar as a way to group the sum.*

advanced: A=85% B=5% C=2% D=8%
*Advanced students quickly recognise that A is the only algebraically sound expression. They will explicitly reject B due to order of operations. A small percentage might overthink and choose D if they feel the 0 "must" be written in the sum for it to be technically "the" calculation.*
