This question is a significant "trap" for students across the ability spectrum because it tests three distinct potential errors: BIDMAS (Order of Operations), decimal multiplication, and incorrect squaring.

1.  **Order of Operations (Option A):** Weaker students often perform $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$. 
2.  **Place Value/Decimal Squaring (Option B):** Students may know to square first but calculate $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ (instead of $0.09$), leading to $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$. However, $0.27$ is often chosen by those who get $0.09$ but then struggle with the subsequent multiplication or place value logic.
3.  **The Correct Path (Option B):** $0.3^2 = 0.09$, and $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.
4.  **The "Multiplied by 2" Error (Option D):** Students who think squaring means "multiply by 2" will calculate $3 \times (0.3 \times 2) = 1.8$.

In my experience, **Option D** is extremely popular among Basic/Below Basic students because they default to $x \times 2$ for $x^2$. However, **Option A** is the most common error for Proficient students who know how to square but forget the priority of indices over multiplication.

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=25% D=35%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
proficient: A=35% B=45% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=10% B=85% C=3% D=2%
