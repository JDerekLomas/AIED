In this question, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4), but Step 2 contains a common procedural error. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$, Isaac has added 1.

This is a classic "inverse operation" error. Below-basic students often see a "1" and a "60" and instinctively add them, or they misinterpret the structure of the equation entirely. Proficient students usually spot the error in Step 2 quickly, as they are accustomed to checking the "balance" of an equation. Advanced students will almost universally identify that only the first step is valid.

The distractors are effective here because Step 1 looks "right" to most, but the common mistake of adding instead of subtracting in Step 2 is a very frequent pitfall in UK classrooms (Year 7-9).
