As an experienced teacher, I've seen students tackle this specific algebraic fraction problem many times. Here is the breakdown of how different ability levels typically perform on this question.

**Key insights:**
*   **The Trap (Option B):** "Add the tops, add the bottoms" ($3+4=7, 2x+x=3x$) is the classic misconception for lower-attaining students. 
*   **The Mistake (Option D):** This is for students who recognize they need a common denominator of $2x$, but forget to multiply the numerator of the second fraction by 2. They just add $3+4$ over the correct denominator.
*   **The Error (Option C):** This represents students who get the numerator correct ($3 + 8 = 11$) but somehow lose the '2' in the denominator or mistakenly cancel it out.
*   **Success (Option A):** Requires finding the common denominator $2x$ and correctly adjusting the second fraction to $\frac{8}{2x}$.
