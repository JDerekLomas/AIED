This question tests the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). 

The complexity lies in the fact that many students intuitively want to work from left to right. On the left side, the "common sense" approach ($8+12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$) matches the explicit structure of the right side where brackets are present. Students who do not understand that division takes priority over addition will conclude that both sides equal 5 and choose option C.

**Breakdown of thought process:**
*   **The Left Side:** $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$.
*   **The Right Side:** $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$.
*   **The Correct Answer:** $11 > 5$ (Option A).
*   **The Trap:** Students often see the same numbers and operators and assume the brackets make no difference or that the left side is naturally $20 \div 4$. Option C is the primary distractor for lower-ability students. Option B is chosen by students who calculate correctly but confuse the inequality symbols.
