This question tests the transition from arithmetic notation ($\div$) to algebraic notation (fraction bar). While it seems straightforward, the inclusion of brackets is a specific hurdle. 

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **Option B:** Appeals to students who see "+4" and think it needs to be applied to both parts of the fraction or simply misread the numerator.
*   **Option C:** A very common error. Students often forget that the fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol. This represents a failure to understand that the entire $(h+4)$ is the divisor.
*   **Option D:** A classic "reversal" error. Students often confuse which term is the numerator and which is the denominator in a division.

**Teaching Context:**
*   **Below Basic** students often struggle with the direction of division (leading to D) or try to "simplify" by moving numbers around (leading to B).
*   **Basic/Proficient** students understand that division becomes a fraction, but the "invisible brackets" of a fraction bar are a common sticking point, leading them to pick C if they think the division only applies to the first term of the expression.
*   **Advanced** students will recognize this as a foundational rule and find it very easy.

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=65% B=5% C=18% D=12%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=10% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
