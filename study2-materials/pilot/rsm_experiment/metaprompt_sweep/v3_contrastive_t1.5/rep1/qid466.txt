This question is a classic test of the "multiplicative inverse" and "negative number signs." While most students know that $1$ is the result of multiplying a fraction by its reciprocal, the presence of the negative sign creates a significant "sign error" trap.

**Analysis:**
1.  **The Fraction Flip:** Most students from Basic upwards will correctly identify that $\frac{3}{4}$ needs to be flipped to $\frac{4}{3}$ to reach a magnitude of $1$.
2.  **The Negative Trap:** This is where the majority of errors occur. A common misconception is that "the reciprocal of a negative must be positive" or that the negative signs "cancel out" in the question itself. 
3.  **Low Ability (Below Basic):** These students often see $-1$ and the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$ and choose $C$ or $D$ simply because they contain the same digits as the question, or they believe they just need to "remove" the negative sign.
4.  **Mid Ability (Basic/Proficient):** This group is the most likely to choose **B** instead of **A**. They know the rule for the reciprocal but forget that multiplying a negative by a negative results in a *positive* $1$. Since the target is $-1$, the multiplier must be positive.
5.  **High Ability (Advanced):** These students check their signs and realize $(- ) \times (+) = (-)$.
