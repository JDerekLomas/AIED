This question is a classic test of two distinct areas: the understanding of negative bases with exponents and the "multiplication instead of power" error.

For students at the **below_basic** level, the most common error is multiplying the base by the index ($3 \times 4 = 12$). Because the base is negative, they often simply attach the negative sign to that result, making D a very attractive distractor.

At the **basic** and **proficient** levels, students generally know that $3^4 = 81$, but the "negative base" rule is the primary separator. Many students follow a flawed logic that "if the input is negative, the output is negative," leading them to choose C. Even students who use calculators incorrectly (typing $-3^4$ without brackets) will be reinforced in this error by the display of $-81$.

**Advanced** students recognise that an even power of any real number (other than zero) must be positive, and they correctly evaluate $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$.

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=2% C=30% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=0% C=4% D=0%
