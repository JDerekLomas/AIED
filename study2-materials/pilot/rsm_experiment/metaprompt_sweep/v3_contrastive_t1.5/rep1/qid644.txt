As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common student behaviours when expanding brackets (FOIL/Grid method).

This specific question focuses on the "Last" terms: $(-1) \times (-4)$. The primary hurdles here are the directed numbers rule (negative times a negative) and the confusion between multiplying and adding. Students at the 'below basic' and 'basic' levels often default to addition ($1+4=5$) or forget that the sign belongs to the term. 'Proficient' students usually know to multiply but occasionally stumble on the sign, whereas 'Advanced' students rarely miss the double negative.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A (+4):** Correct application of $(-1) \times (-4)$.
*   **B (-4):** Multiplication is correct, but the sign rule is misapplied.
*   **C (+5):** Student added instead of multiplied (often thinking they are "combining" the terms).
*   **D (-5):** Student added $-1$ and $-4$, a very common error for those who see the expansion process as "collecting" terms rather than a product.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=82% B=10% C=3% D=5%
advanced: A=97% B=2% C=0% D=1%
