To solve this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, so $x = 3.3$.

**Analysis of Difficulty:**
*   **The Trap (Option C vs D):** The most common error in linear equations with a minus sign ($-6y$) is for students to add the term incorrectly. However, the calculation $10x - 3 = 30$ is quite intuitive. Some students may accidentally do $30 - 3 = 27$ then divide by 10 to get $2.7$ (Option D).
*   **The "Half" Factor:** Substituting $0.5$ is easier than a fraction, but many "Below Basic" students will struggle with the $6 \times 0.5$ calculation or forget the negative sign.
*   **The Swap (Options A & B):** These options represent students who swap $x$ and $y$, solving $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$, leading to $5 - 6y = 30$, so $-6y = 25$, $y \approx -4.16$. Option A/B are distractors for those who perhaps try to add $12$ (if they doubled $0.5$ instead of halving) or make other arithmetic slips, but C and D are the primary contenders.
*   **Success Rate:** Because this involves a decimal ($0.5$) and a two-step equation, it's a solid mid-tier GCSE Foundation/Higher crossover question.
