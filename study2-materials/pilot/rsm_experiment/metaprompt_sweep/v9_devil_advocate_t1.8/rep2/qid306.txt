As an experienced teacher, I have seen thousands of students encounter this specific trap. The danger here lies in how Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) is taught. 

Students are often taught the acronym literally. Because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction), a significant number of students—even high achievers—falsely believe they must add before they subtract. In **Problem P**, they look for $5+6$ first, mistakenly ignoring that the subtraction sign belongs to the 5, or thinking the rule dictates addition happens first.

In **Problem Q**, the hierarchy is clearer (Multiplication before Addition), but "Below Basic" students often still process calculations left-to-right.

The "Advanced" students are the only ones who consistently remember that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right, making Option B the correct choice.

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
advanced: A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%
