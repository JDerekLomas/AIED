As a UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle two-step equations. 

At first glance, this seems like a straightforward check of algebraic manipulation. However, **Katie's error is the "classic" mistake** made by students who have a fragile understanding of the distributive property of multiplication over addition/subtraction. Students often remember "I need to multiply by the denominator" but forget that they must multiply *every* term on both sides. To many students, Katie’s working "looks" right because 12 × 3 is 36.

Tom’s method (adding 5 first) is the standard taught procedure. Higher-ability students will recognize that while Katie *could* have been right if she had multiplied the 5 by 3, her specific line is incorrect.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
*(These students often think both look like "maths things you do" and choose C. Many gravitate toward Katie because they prefer multiplying to get rid of fractions early.)*

basic: A=35% B=20% C=40% D=5%
*(A large portion of this group still believes Katie's method is valid because they don't see the 5 as being part of the requirement for multiplication.)*

proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
*(Most have internalized "BIDMAS in reverse" for equations, making them trust Tom. However, a significant minority will still fall for the visual plausibility of Katie's 12 × 3 = 36.)*

advanced: A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%
*(Advanced students see that Katie failed to multiply the -5. Only a tiny fraction might misread the question or overthink whether Katie "could" have been correct in a different universe.)*

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=20% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%
