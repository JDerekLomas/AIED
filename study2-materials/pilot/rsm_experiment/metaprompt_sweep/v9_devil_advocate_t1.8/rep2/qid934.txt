In assessing this question, I have considered the specific layout and the cognitive load required to solve a linear equation where the variable to be substituted ($x=0$) is "easy," but the equation itself is not in the standard $y=mx+c$ format. 

While the substitution $4(0)$ is straightforward, many students struggle with two-step equations involving division. The most common distractors here are:
*   **A (20):** Students multiply $4 \times 5$ (incorrectly seeing $10 + 10$) or misinterpreting the relation.
*   **B (3):** Students accidentally substituting $x=1$ instead of $x=0$, or a simple calculation error.
*   **D (2.5):** Students dividing 10 by 4 instead of 10 by 2, or losing the $+2y$ and treating it as $4y=10$.

The biggest "trap" for students is actually the $4x$ term; because it comes first, many students feel the answer should involve the 4 and 10 primarily ($10 \div 4 = 2.5$).
