To predict these percentages accurately, we must consider the most common student misconceptions regarding algebraic fractions. 

The "shortcut" for many students is to add the numerators and add the denominators, leading to **Option B** ($7/3x$). This is the classic "freshman's dream" error. 

Higher-level students sometimes find a common denominator of $2x^2$ by multiplying the two denominators together, which can lead to calculation errors if they don't simplify correctly. However, the most frequent error for "proficient" students who understand they need a common denominator of $2x$ is forgetting to multiply the second numerator by 2, leading to **Option D** ($7/2x$).

**Option A** is the correct answer ($3/2x + 8/2x = 11/2x$).

**Option C** ($11/x$) is a result of correctly adding the numerators but mistakenly "cancelling" or ignoring the 2 in the denominator during the process.
