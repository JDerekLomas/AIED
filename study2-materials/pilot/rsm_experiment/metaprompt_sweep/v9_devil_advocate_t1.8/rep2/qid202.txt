As an experienced teacher, my initial reaction is that this is a straightforward "Level 4/5" addition question. However, when looking at the options and common misconceptions, there are several "traps" for students. 

**Option A** is the correct mixed number. 
**Option B** is numerically correct but is an improper fraction, and the question specifically asks for a mixed number; students who lack exam technique or ignore the final instruction will fall for this. 
**Option D** represents the "add everything" error (adding both the numerators AND the denominators), which is the single most common error in fraction addition.
**Option C** represents a catastrophic misunderstanding of both fraction addition and mixed number structure.

Here is the predicted distribution based on typical UK classroom performance:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=5% D=40%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=92% B=6% C=1% D=1%
