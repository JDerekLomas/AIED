To predict these percentages, I have evaluated the likely cognitive pathways and common errors:
1.  **The Substitution Error (Advanced/Proficient):** High-ability students will substitute $y = 0.5$, getting $10x - 3 = 30$, leading to $10x = 33$, thus $x = 3.3$ (Option C).
2.  **The Sign Error (Basic):** Many students struggle with the $-6y$ when moving it across the equals sign. They calculate $10x + 3 = 30$, leading to $10x = 27$, thus $x = 2.7$ (Option D).
3.  **The Misinterpretation (Below Basic):** Students often confuse the variables. If they substitute $x = 0.5$ to find $y$, they get $5 - 6y = 30$, leading to $-6y = 25$, $y = -4.16...$ (near Option B). Alternatively, many simply perform $30 \div 6 - 0.5$ or $30 \div 10 + 0.5$ to get 3.5 or 2.5 and then guess the closest decimal.
4.  **Teacher's Insight:** Teachers often think $3.3$ is "too easy," but the presence of $0.5$ usually prompts students to work with fractions or decimals. The decimal $3.3$ is actually a common pitfall because students expect "cleaner" halves like $.25$ or $.75$ when they see $0.5$ in the question.
