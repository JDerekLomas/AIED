To predict these percentages accurately, we must consider the specific pitfalls of order of operations (BIDMAS) and how students at different levels process expressions.

**LHS:** $8 + 12 \div 4$. The common error is performing addition first $(20 \div 4 = 5)$. Correct application yields $8 + 3 = 11$.
**RHS:** $(8 + 12) \div 4$. Students almost always handle the bracket correctly, yielding $20 \div 4 = 5$.

The comparison is $11$ vs $5$, so **A ($>$)** is the correct answer.

**Student Logic Pitfalls:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often ignore BIDMAS entirely or work strictly left-to-right. They calculate the LHS as $20 \div 4 = 5$ and the RHS as $20 \div 4 = 5$, leading them strongly toward **C (=)**.
*   **Basic:** These students have heard of BIDMAS but are inconsistent. Many still believe addition comes before division because they misread the acronym or follow the "left-to-right" instinct for addition. Many will still choose **C**, though some will get it right.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually apply BIDMAS correctly. However, a non-negligible percentage will see the same numbers on both sides and instinctively select **C** without calculating, or they might flip the inequality symbol (**B**) due to a momentary lapse in comparing 11 and 5.
*   **Advanced:** These students see the structural difference immediately. They recognize that on the LHS only the 12 is divided by 4, whereas on the RHS the whole sum is divided, making the LHS larger.
