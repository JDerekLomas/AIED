As a UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students grapple with indices and negative numbers. This specific question is a "classic" trap. 

While mathematicians see $k^4$ as $(-3)^4$, many students—especially those using non-scientific calculators or mental methods—fall into the trap of calculating $-(3^4)$ or confuse exponentiation with multiplication ($k \times 4$). The "basic" and "below basic" students often default to multiplication ($3 \times 4 = 12$) or forget that an even power results in a positive value. Even "proficient" students frequently make the sign error (Option C), treating it as $-3^4$.

Here is my prediction of the performance breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%
