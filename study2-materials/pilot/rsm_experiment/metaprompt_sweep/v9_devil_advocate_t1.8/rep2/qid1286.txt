To accurately predict the performance on this question, we must look at the standard algebraic pitfalls when rearranging formulae involving fractions, powers, and $\pi$. 

The correct derivation is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \rightarrow 3V = 4\pi r^3 \rightarrow \frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$, making **C** the correct answer.

However, students struggle with the following:
1.  **Option A (The "Multiplying Everything" error):** Weaker students often see a 3 and a 4 and simply multiply the given volume by all components of the formula they recognise. 
2.  **Option B (The $\pi$ placement error):** Students often remember that the $4$ and $3$ swap positions, but they get confused about whether $\pi$ is part of the "top" or "bottom" of the original fraction, leading to it ending up in the wrong place during division.
3.  **Option D (The partial root error):** Students forget that the cube root must apply to the entire expression, not just the $V$.

**Below Basic:** These students often pick options based on visual "clutter" or mimicry. Many will choose A because it feels "complete" or B because they are unsure of where $\pi$ belongs.
**Basic:** This group usually knows the formula for the volume of a sphere but struggles with the multi-step rearrangement, often failing to move the $4\pi$ correctly.
**Proficient:** These students usually reach the correct answer but a significant minority will fall for B by mismanaging the fraction division ($V \div \frac{4}{3}\pi$).
**Advanced:** High-performing GCSE students should find this straightforward, though some may make a transcription error.
