In assessing this question, a teacher’s bias is to assume students will automatically see the reciprocal relationship ($x \times \frac{1}{x} = 1$). However, for many students, "multiplication that results in 1" is often confused with "addition that results in 0." 

The sign management is the primary "trap." Students often remember "two negatives make a positive" but forget to apply it when working backwards, or they erroneously apply the rule for perpendicular gradients (negative reciprocals) which would lead them to choice A instead of B.

**below_basic:** These students struggle with fraction operations and negative rules. Many will pick C or D simply because those numbers are already in the question, or A because they have a vague memory that the numbers need to "flip."
**basic:** This group knows the numbers should flip, but they often forget that a negative times a negative is required to get the negative answer in the prompt, or they incorrectly think "the signs must be different to stay negative."
**proficient:** These students generally understand the multiplicative inverse but are susceptible to "sign fatigue" or the "perpendicular gradient" distractor (negative reciprocal).
**advanced:** These students recognize the identity $a \times \frac{1}{a} = 1$, so they deduce that $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1$ with high accuracy.
