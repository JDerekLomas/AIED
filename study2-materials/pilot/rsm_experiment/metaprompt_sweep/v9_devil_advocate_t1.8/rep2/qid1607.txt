As a UK maths teacher, I have seen hundreds of students tackle this specific type of multi-step equation. My initial instinct is to say this is "easy," but student performance data on "spot the mistake" questions shows a common, systematic error.

While Step 1 is correct (multiplying by 4), the mistake in Step 2 is the "classic sign error." Many students see the $+1$ and instinctively add it to 60 to get 61, rather than subtracting it. They "move" the number across the equals sign but fail to perform the inverse operation. Crucially, many students who make this mistake in Step 2 will look back at Step 1, see it "looks right," and conclude that both must be correct because 61 feels like a plausible answer.

Here is the predicted distribution based on these common misconceptions:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%
