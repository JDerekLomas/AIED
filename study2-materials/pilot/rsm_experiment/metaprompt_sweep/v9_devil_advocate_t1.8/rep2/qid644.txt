In my experience teaching KS3 and KS4, this question is a classic "trap" for lower-ability students. While an experienced mathematician sees a simple $(-1) \times (-4)$, a significant number of students fail to recognise that expanding brackets involves **multiplication**. 

Students at the 'Below Basic' level frequently default to addition (getting $-5$) because their brains process the expression "$-1$ and $-4$" as a combination of two debts. Even those who know to multiply often struggle with the "double negative" rule.

**below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=5% D=50%**
*(The majority will see -1 and -4 and perform addition, leading them to -5. Others will guess between A and B, often forgetting that a negative times a negative is a positive.)*

**basic: A=45% B=30% C=5% D=20%**
*(Students at this level are learning the FOIL/Grid method and know to multiply, but the sign error (-1 $\times$ -4 = -4) remains the single most common mistake in GCSE Foundation papers.)*

**proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%**
*(These students have practiced bracket expansion enough that the 'negative $\times$ negative' rule is usually secure, though some still make 'slippage' errors under pressure.)*

**advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%**
*(High-ability students see this as a trivial component of a larger problem. Errors here are extremely rare and usually due to extreme haste.)*
