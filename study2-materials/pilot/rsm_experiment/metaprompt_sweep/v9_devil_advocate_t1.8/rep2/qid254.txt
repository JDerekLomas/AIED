This question is a classic "trap" in the UK curriculum. It tests two distinct areas of potential misconception: the treatment of zero in a data set and the correct use of order of operations (BIDMAS) when writing expressions.

As a teacher, my instinct says students should know to include the 0 in the count but not the sum. However, the calculation format is the real hurdle.

**Analysis of student errors:**
1.  **Option A (Correct):** Adding the non-zero digits and dividing by 5 is mathematically equivalent to adding all digits including 0 and dividing by 5.
2.  **Option B (The BIDMAS trap):** Many students know they need to "add them all and divide by 5," so they look for those symbols. They often forget that without brackets, only the 7 is being divided by 5.
3.  **Option C (The Zero trap):** Lower-ability students often ignore zero entirely, both in the sum and the denominator.
4.  **Option D (The Over-thinker):** High-ability students might choose this if they are hyper-focused on the fact that the '0' isn't explicitly written in the numerator of A, even though the result is the same.

**Predicted Results:**

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=40% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=30% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=85% B=5% C=0% D=10%
