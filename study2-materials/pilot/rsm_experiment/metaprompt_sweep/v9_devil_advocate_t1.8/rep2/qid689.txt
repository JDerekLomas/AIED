As a teacher, my initial reaction is that this is a simple "one-step" rearrangement. However, looking through the lens of a student, this is a classic "variable in the denominator" trap. 

Most lower-ability students do not perform algebraic manipulation; they perform "operation spotting." They see the numbers 10 and 5 and immediately think of the relationship $10 \div 5 = 2$ or $10 \times 5 = 50$. The most common error is to assume the equation is $p = 10 \div 5$, leading to $p=2$ (Option C). This feels "right" because 2 is a whole number and fits the pattern of the digits provided.

Another significant group will attempt to "undo" the fraction by multiplying, but they will multiply 10 by 5 to get 50 (Option B). 

Option A ($p=0.5$) is the correct answer ($10p = 5$, so $p = 5/10$), but it is highly counter-intuitive to students because it results in a value smaller than the integers in the question, and many struggle with the idea that $5 \div 0.5 = 10$.
