To accurately predict the percentages, we must look at the specific order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) errors students make.

The correct method is: $3 - 5 + (4 \times 2) = 3 - 5 + 8 = 6$ (Option A).

**Common Misconceptions:**
1.  **Left-to-Right ignoring BIDMAS:** $(3 - 5) + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$ (Option B). Many lower-ability students process math like a sentence.
2.  **The "Addition before Subtraction" Trap:** This is the most significant distractor for mid-tier students. They see "A" before "S" in BIDMAS and perform $5 + 8 = 13$, then $3 - 13 = -10$ (Option D). Or, even more likely, they add the "visible" plus sign first: $3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 = 3 - 18 = -15$ (not listed) or $(3 - 5 + 4) \times 2 = 4 \times 2 = 8$ (not listed).
3.  **The "Addition first" specific error:** $3 - (5+8) = -10$ (Option D) or the calculation $(3-5+4) \times 2 \rightarrow (3-9) \times 2 = -12$ (Option C).

While it looks simple, the interaction between the negative sign and the addition/multiplication is a notorious "low floor, high ceiling" mistake generator.
