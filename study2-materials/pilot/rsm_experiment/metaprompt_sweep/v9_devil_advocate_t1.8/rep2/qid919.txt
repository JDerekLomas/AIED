As a UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle decimal substitution. While this looks like a "Grade 4" (standard GCSE) question, the combination of squaring a decimal and a coefficient is a classic trap.

The most common error for **Below Basic** and **Basic** students is a place value error or forgetting the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Specifically, many students will either calculate $(3 \times 0.3)^2$ or simply misplace the decimal point when squaring $0.3$ (thinking $0.3^2 = 0.9$ rather than $0.09$).

**The Tricky Element:** 
- Students often think $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. This leads to $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ (Option D).
- Students who multiply first $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then square $0.9$ get $0.81$ (Option A).
- Students who fail to square but multiply $3 \times 0.3$ and maybe try to adjust for the squared sign sometimes end up at $0.18$ or $1.8$ (Option C) through guesswork.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=20% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=20% B=45% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%
