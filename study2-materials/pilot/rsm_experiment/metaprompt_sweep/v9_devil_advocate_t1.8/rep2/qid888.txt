To accurately predict student performance on this classic quadratic expansion, we must look at the specific common errors (misconceptions) associated with directed numbers (negatives).

While "FOIL" or the grid method is taught universally, the interaction of $-5$ and $-7$ provides two significant hurdles: the sum $(-5 - 7)$ and the product $(-5 \times -7)$.

*   **A ($m^2 - 2m - 35$):** This represents a student who subtracts the digits ($7-5=2$) and incorrectly applies the negative sign to the product.
*   **B (Correct):** Correct application of $-5 - 7 = -12$ and $-5 \times -7 = +35$.
*   **C ($m^2 + 12m + 35$):** This is a very common "over-correction" where students see two negatives and assume every term in the answer must become positive.
*   **D ($m^2 - 12m - 35$):** The most common mistake. Students correctly sum to $-12$ but forget that a "negative times a negative is a positive." This error persists even into higher-level GCSE tiers.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=94% C=1% D=3%
