In assessing this question, I must look past the mathematical simplicity and consider the cognitive hurdles for UK students (Year 7-9). While A is mathematically "obvious" to a teacher, many students struggle with the visual translation of division to fraction bars, particularly when brackets are involved.

Students at the lower end often treat algebra like a "find and replace" game rather than a logical structure. A common error is "term-splitting" or losing the integrity of the denominator. Option D is the classic "reversal" error (dividing the divisor by the dividend), which occurs when students read from right-to-left or simply place the more complex term on top. Option C reflects a misunderstanding of how the vinculum (fraction bar) replaces the need for brackets.
