As a UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students grapple with BIDMAS (Order of Operations). While Problem Q is a standard test of multiplication before addition, Problem P is the "trap" that catches even high-achieving students. 

Many students are taught the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS literally, believing that "Addition" (A) must always come before "Subtraction" (S). This leads them to mistakenly believe they should calculate $5+6$ first in Problem P. In reality, addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be worked from left to right. Even advanced students often fall into this "A before S" trap because the acronym is so deeply ingrained.

basic: A=10% B=20% C=25% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=45% C=10% D=40%
advanced: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
