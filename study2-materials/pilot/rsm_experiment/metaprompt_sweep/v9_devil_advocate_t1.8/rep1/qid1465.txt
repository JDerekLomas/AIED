To accurately predict the outcome of this BODMAS/BIDMAS question, we must look at the specific psychological traps for UK students.

The primary pitfall here is the "Left-to-Right" bias, which is stronger in many students' minds than the order of operations. Many will calculate $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$ (Option B). 

Another significant error is "Addition before Subtraction." In the UK, BIDMAS places A before S, leading students to mistakenly believe they must add $5+4$ first. This leads to $3 - 9 = -6$ (not an option) or even $(3-5) + 4 = 2 \times 2$ (re-indexing).

The correct path ($4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 + 8 = 6$) requires suppressing the urge to start at the beginning of the sentence.

**Below Basic:** Students at this level almost always work strictly left-to-right. They calculate $(3-5) = -2$, then $(-2+4) = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$.
**Basic:** These students often remember "Multiplication first," but struggle with the signs. They do $4 \times 2 = 8$, but then struggle with $3 - 5 + 8$, often performing $(5+8) = 13$, then $3-13 = -10$.
**Proficient:** These students know BIDMAS well but can be tripped up by the subtraction/addition order (associativity). They calculate $8$, then perform $3-5+8$ correctly.
**Advanced:** These students see $3 - 5 + 8$ as three terms ($+3, -5, +8$) and resolve it with high accuracy.

below_basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=30% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=0% D=10%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
