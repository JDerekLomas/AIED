As a UK maths teacher, I've seen thousands of students tackle decimal substitution. At first glance, this looks like a straightforward substitution. However, this specific problem is a minefield for place value and order of operations (BIDMAS).

Many students will calculate $(3 \times 0.3)^2$ (getting 0.81) because they process the numbers left-to-right, ignoring the index priority. Others will correctly square 0.3 but arrive at 0.9 rather than 0.09, leading to the distractor 2.7. The most common error for middle-ability students is squaring 0.3 to get 0.09 but then making a further decimal placement error, or mistakenly squaring the 3 as well.

Here is my prediction of the performance breakdown:

below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=20% D=30%
proficient: A=20% B=45% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%
