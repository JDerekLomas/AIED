In my experience teaching this specific algebraic concept across different year groups (from Year 7 introductory equations to GCSE foundation classes), the "multiplication vs. addition" priority is a classic sticking point.

Tom is correct because he adds 5 to both sides ($\frac{x}{3} = 17$). 
Katie is incorrect because she attempts to multiply by 3 but forgets to multiply the $-5$ term as well (a very common student error). To be correct, she would have needed to write $x - 15 = 36$.

Students often see "the fraction" and want to "get rid of it" first (Katie's method), but they rarely apply the multiplication to every term on the left-hand side. Many students see both steps as "logical" without actually testing the equality.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=10% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=60% B=5% C=30% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=7% D=1%
