To predict the performance on this question, we must look beyond the simple rule of reciprocals. As teachers, we know "flipping a fraction results in 1," but students frequently struggle with the **interplay between the reciprocal and the sign**.

The presence of the negative sign in the product (-1) is a major "distractor trap."
1.  **The Sign Error:** Many students see the negative in the result (-1) and assume the multiplier must also be negative (Option B) to "keep the negative sign there." They forget that a negative multiplied by a positive remains negative.
2.  **The Additive vs. Multiplicative Confusion:** Below-basic students often see a $-1$ and think about what is "missing" to complete a whole or simply repeat the number in the question.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=45% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=25% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=7% C=1% D=0%

**Reasoning:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often guess. Option B is highly attractive because it "looks" like the first fraction and includes a negative sign.
*   **Basic:** This group knows they need to flip the fraction, but they often over-apply the rule that "a negative times a negative equals a positive." Because the target is $-1$, they reflexively pick Option B to "ensure" there is a negative sign present, mistakenly thinking two negatives are needed to keep the result negative.
*   **Proficient:** These students have mastered the reciprocal but may still make a fleeting sign error under time pressure.
*   **Advanced:** These students check their work by calculating $(3 \times 4) / (4 \times 3) = 12/12 = 1$ and correctly handle the single negative sign.
