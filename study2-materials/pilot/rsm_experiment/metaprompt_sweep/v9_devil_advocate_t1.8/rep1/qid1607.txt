As a UK maths teacher, I have seen hundreds of students tackle this exact type of linear equation. At first glance, Step 1 is clearly correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$). However, Step 2 is the classic "operation error."

To move the $+1$ to the other side, the student should subtract $1$ (giving $k = 59$), but Isaac adds $1$ instead ($60 + 1 = 61$).

Many lower-ability students see "60" and "1" and "61" and instinctively feel the math "looks right" because the numbers are simple and positive. Advanced students will quickly spot the sign error. The most common distractor for middle-ability students is "C," as they often overlook the inverse operation rule when the numbers are this straightforward.

Here is the predicted distribution based on standard UK GCSE cohorts:

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=65% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=5% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=4% D=2%
