To accurately predict student performance on this question, we must look at the specific points of failure. The equation $10x - 6y = 30$ with $y = 0.5$ leads to $10x - 3 = 30$. 

The most common error in GCSE Foundation and lower-tier Higher students is the handling of the subtraction sign when rearranging. Many will perform $30 - 3$ rather than $30 + 3$, leading to $10x = 27$ and $x = 2.7$ (Option D). Others will struggle with the decimal multiplication $6 \times 0.5$, potentially viewing it as $6.5$ or simply $6$, leading to Option C. Higher-ability students may still slip up on the signs, but are more likely to reach $10x = 33$ and correctly identify $3.3$ (Option C).

The correct answer is $10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$ (Option C).
