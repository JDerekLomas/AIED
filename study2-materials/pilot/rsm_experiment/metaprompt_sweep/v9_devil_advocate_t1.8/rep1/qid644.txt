To predict these percentages, I have considered the most common pitfalls for UK students when expanding brackets:
1.  **Negative Numbers:** The most common error in GCSE-level algebra is failing to account for the "double negative" making a positive.
2.  **Operation Confusion:** Weaker students often see a -1 and a -4 and instinctively perform an addition or subtraction (-1 - 4 = -5) rather than the required multiplication for expansion.
3.  **Basic Arithmetic:** Some students mistakenly add the absolute values (1 + 4 = 5) rather than multiplying (1 × 4 = 4).

While this looks like a "Grade 4" foundation question, the combination of two negatives and the distraction of the addition/subtraction operation makes it a high-error item for lower-attaining students.

**below_basic:** A=30% B=20% C=15% D=35%
*(Commentary: These students frequently see "minus 1" and "minus 4" and calculate -1 - 4 to get -5, or simply fail to handle the double negative, making B a strong attractor.)*

**basic:** A=55% B=25% C=5% D=15%
*(Commentary: Students at this level know they should multiply, but many will still struggle with the sign rule, making B the most popular distractor. Some will still default to addition/subtraction.)*

**proficient:** A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
*(Commentary: Most proficient students have internalised the "negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive" rule, though "sign slips" still occur under pressure.)*

**advanced:** A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
*(Commentary: Almost all advanced students will identify this as 4; the very small margin for error is due to rare "working too fast" slips.)*
