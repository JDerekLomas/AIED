As a UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students grapple with indices and directed numbers. My first instinct is to say this is a "Grade 4" (standard GCSE) question, but it contains a notorious "trap" that catches even very bright students.

The primary pitfall here is the interaction between the negative sign and the even power. Many students use calculators incorrectly, entering $-3^4$ instead of $(-3)^4$, leading them to option C. Lower-ability students often confuse indices with multiplication (Option B or D).

Here is the predicted distribution:

**below_basic:** A=15% B=40% C=10% D=35%
*Lower ability students (Grade 1-2) almost universally mistake the index for a multiplier. They will see $k=3, 3 \times 4 = 12$ and then struggle with the sign, often defaulting to D because the input was negative.*

**basic:** A=30% B=20% C=35% D=15%
*Mid-to-low ability students (Grade 3) know $3^4$ is $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$, but they have a fragile grasp of negative powers. Many believe that if the base is negative, the answer must be negative, regardless of the exponent. C is a very "sticky" distractor here.*

**proficient:** A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%
*Mid-to-high ability students (Grade 5-6) know the arithmetic. However, even at this level, there is a high "execution error" rate. If they have a calculator, they often type $-3^4$ (which the calculator correctly identifies as $-(3^4) = -81$). They assume the calculator is right and don't apply the bracket rule.*

**advanced:** A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%
*High ability students (Grade 7-9) recognise that an even power turns a negative base positive. The few who miss it usually do so through extreme overconfidence or a literal calculator input error without checking the logic.*
