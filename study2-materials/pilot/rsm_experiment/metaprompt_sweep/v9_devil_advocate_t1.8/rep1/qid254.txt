As a UK maths teacher, I have seen hundreds of students tackle the concept of the mean. This specific question is a "trap" question that tests two very specific misconceptions: the treatment of zero and the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

**The Breakdown:**
*   **The Zero Trap:** Many students (Basic/Below Basic) believe that because zero "is nothing," it doesn't count as a value in the denominator. This leads them to C.
*   **The BIDMAS Trap:** Option B looks like the right formula if read left-to-right, but without brackets, it actually means $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + (7 \div 5)$. Proficient students often spot this, but Basic students frequently miss it.
*   **The Summation Trap:** Option A is mathematically correct because $0+1+3+4+7$ is the same as $1+3+4+7$, and the denominator is 5. However, many students get "spooked" that the 0 isn't explicitly written in the numerator and overthink it.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=50% B=15% C=15% D=20%
advanced: A=85% B=5% C=2% D=8%
