To accurately predict the performance on this question, we must consider the specific algebraic hurdles involved in rearranging the formula for the volume of a sphere: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

**Common Pitfalls:**
1.  **Inverse Operations:** Students often struggle with the coefficient $\frac{4}{3}$. Many will try to "move" the 4 and 3 without correctly identifying that to undo a fraction, you multiply by the denominator and divide by the numerator.
2.  **$\pi$ placement:** A very common error is thinking that because $\pi$ is "on top" next to the $r$, it somehow stays on top or ends up as a multiplier in the final root.
3.  **Root extraction:** Below-basic students often forget the cube root entirely or apply it incorrectly to only part of the expression (Option D).

**Predicted Statistics:**

below_basic: A=35% B=30% C=20% D=15%
*At this level, students often guess based on "math-y" looking terms. Option A is a common distractor because it keeps the $\frac{4}{3}$ structure intact, which feels "right" to a student who doesn't understand inverse operations.*

basic: A=25% B=35% C=30% D=10%
*These students recognize the formula but often stumble on the first step of the rearrangement. Many will correctly identify that $\pi$ should be on the bottom (B or C) but will flip the 4 and 3 incorrectly.*

proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
*Proficient students (Grade 6/7) are generally solid with fractional equations. The main source of error here is a "slip" in algebraic manipulation or rushing and choosing B because the 4 remains the numerator of the coefficient.*

advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
*Advanced students (Grade 8/9) should find this routine. Errors at this level are almost exclusively down to misreading the options or "silly" transcription errors.*
