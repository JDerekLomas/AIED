As an experienced teacher, I have seen many students tackle algebraic fractions. While this looks like a straightforward addition, the presence of the variable $x$ and the differing denominators ($2x$ vs $x$) creates several common pitfalls.

**Teacher's Insight:**
1.  **The Common Error (Option B):** "Add the tops, add the bottoms." Students at lower levels treat fractions as two separate additions ($3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$). 
2.  **The "Forgot the Denominator" Error (Option D):** Many students realize the common denominator is $2x$, but fail to adjust the numerator of the second fraction. They do $3/2x + 4/2x = 7/2x$.
3.  **The Wrong Scaling (Option C):** Some students might try to get rid of the 2, or incorrectly multiply both sides by 2, resulting in $11/x$.
4.  **The Correct Path (Option A):** Requires multiplying $4/x$ by $2/2$ to get $8/2x$, then adding $3/2x + 8/2x = 11/2x$.

Here is the predicted distribution based on these common misconceptions:

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=20% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
