In my experience teaching the GCSE curriculum, binomial expansion involving two negative signs is a classic "trap" for students across the spectrum. While higher-level students have the FOIL/Grid method memorized, their primary pitfall is the multiplication of the constants ($-5 \times -7$).

Lower-ability students often "combine" the middle terms through addition/subtraction but struggle with the signs. The most common error for the "below_basic" tier is the middle term $-2m$ (from incorrectly calculating $-5 + 7$ or simply finding the difference) or the final term $-35$ (failing to recognize that a negative times a negative is a positive). Even proficient students often slip up on the final sign, assuming the negative signs in the brackets must result in a negative constant.

Here is the predicted distribution based on typical classroom performance and common misconceptions:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
