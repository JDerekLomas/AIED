As a UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle fraction addition. At first glance, this looks like a straightforward calculation. However, the "traps" in this specific question are highly effective:

1.  **Option D (The most common error):** Lower-ability students almost universally add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and then simply add the numerators and denominators ($7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$), leading them to $4 \frac{8}{14}$.
2.  **Option A vs. B:** Even students who correctly find the common denominator ($20$) and calculate $4 \frac{19}{20}$ often get confused by the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number." Those who have been drilled in converting to improper fractions may habitually convert $4 \frac{19}{20}$ to $\frac{99}{20}$ and select A, ignoring the mixed number instruction.
3.  **Option C:** This targets students who find a common denominator by simply multiplying $10 \times 4$ to get $40$, but then make errors in the numerator or forget the whole numbers.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=20% D=55%
basic: A=20% B=35% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=25% B=60% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=10% B=88% C=1% D=1%
