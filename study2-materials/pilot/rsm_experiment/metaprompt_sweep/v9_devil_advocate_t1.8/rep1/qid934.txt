To accurately predict the percentages, we must look past the simple substitution $x=0$ and consider how students interact with the equation $4x + 2y = 10$. 

While a mathematician sees $x=0$ as a "free gift," students often struggle with equations where $y$ is not the subject. 
*   **The Trap of D (2.5):** Students often divide the constant by the coefficient of $x$ (10/4) rather than focusing on the $y$ term.
*   **The Trap of A (20):** Students may add 10 and 10, or multiply 4 and 5 incorrectly, or see the "4" and "0" and somehow reach 20 through common misconceptions of linear relationships.
*   **The Trap of B (3):** This is the most common "guess" for students who feel the answer must be a whole number but don't know how to solve for $y$.

The most significant distractor here is actually $D$ or an impulsive miscalculation because $x=0$ often causes students to "ignore" the $4x$ and then perform the wrong operation on the remaining $2y=10$.
