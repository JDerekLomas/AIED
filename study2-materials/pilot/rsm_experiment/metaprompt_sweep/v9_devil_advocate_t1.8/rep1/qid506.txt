To predict the performance on this question, we must look at how students handle fractions and algebraic manipulation. 

**The Mathematical Logic:** To solve $3p = \frac{1}{12}$, you divide both sides by 3. This is equivalent to $p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3$, which becomes $p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$ (**Option B**).

**Common Misconceptions:**
*   **The "Multiplying" Error (Option A):** Students often see the 3 and the 12 and perform the operation that makes the most "comfortable" number ($12 \div 3 = 4$, then making it a fraction $\frac{1}{4}$). This is the most common distractor for students who recognize the numbers but misuse the relationship.
*   **The Integer Bias (Option C):** Below-basic students often ignore the fractional nature entirely or assume that if $3p$ is a fraction, $p$ must be a whole number, leading them to calculate $12 \div 3 = 4$.
*   **The Square/Miscalculation (Option D):** Choosing $D$ often stems from a confusion between multiplying by 3 and squaring, or a simple arithmetic slip.

**Teacher's Reality Check:** Many teachers think this is "easy," but students struggle significantly with division by an integer when a fraction is already present. The cognitive load of "dividing a fraction" leads many to abandon formal steps and rely on "number spotting."
