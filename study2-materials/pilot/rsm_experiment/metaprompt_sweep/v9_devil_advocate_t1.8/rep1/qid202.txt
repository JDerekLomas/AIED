As a UK maths teacher, I have seen this specific type of question many times in Year 7 and 8 assessments. 

While it looks straightforward, there is a significant "trap" involving the denominator. Many lower-ability students instinctively add everything they see—including the denominators. Furthermore, even proficient students often struggle with "form" requirements; they might correctly calculate the value but provide an improper fraction (B) instead of the requested mixed number (A).

**Below Basic:** These students often lack a conceptual understanding of what the denominator represents. Their primary instinct is to add all integers: $2+1=3, 1+2=3, 5+5=10$, leading them directly to D. Some may even skip the whole numbers and just add the fractions as $3/10$ (C).

**Basic:** These students usually know to add the whole numbers. However, the temptation to add the denominators remains strong (D). They are also the group most likely to convert everything to improper fractions to solve it, but then forget to convert back, making B a common pitfall.

**Proficient:** These students generally understand that denominators must remain the same. The main risk here is B (the correct value but the wrong format) or a careless error in "simplifying" the denominator.

**Advanced:** These students recognise the operation immediately and follow the "leave as a mixed number" instruction precisely. Their errors are almost exclusively due to extreme haste.

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
