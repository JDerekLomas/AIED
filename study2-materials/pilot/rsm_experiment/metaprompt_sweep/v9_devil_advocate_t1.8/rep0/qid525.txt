In evaluating this question, I must account for common misconceptions regarding mixed numbers and denominator operations. 

Option **D** is the classic "add the tops, add the bottoms" error ($7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$), which is incredibly common among lower-ability students. 
Option **A** is mathematically equivalent to the correct answer but is presented as an improper fraction. Since the prompt asks for a "mixed number," students who convert to improper fractions to perform the calculation may forget to convert back, or see "99/20" first and select it despite the instruction.
Option **C** is a "cross-multiplication" error where the student multiplies the denominators instead of finding a lowest common multiple, but fails to adjust the numerators or forgets the whole numbers.
Option **B** is the correct mixed number ($4 \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20}$).

Many teachers underestimate how many proficient students will choose **A** because they focus on the "value" rather than the "format" requested.
