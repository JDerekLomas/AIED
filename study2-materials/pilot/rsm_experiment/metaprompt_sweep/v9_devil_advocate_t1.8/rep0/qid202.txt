As an experienced teacher, my initial reaction is that this is a straightforward "Level 4/5" (KS3) addition question. However, when we look at how students actually behave, we see two major hurdles: the format of the final answer and the temptation to add denominators.

Many students instinctively convert to improper fractions first even when they don't need to; if they do this correctly, they reach $18/5$ and may stop there, choosing **B**, ignoring the instruction for a "mixed number." The most common error for lower-ability students is adding the denominators, leading to **D**. **C** represents a double error of adding denominators and forgetting to handle the whole numbers correctly.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=55% B=20% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
