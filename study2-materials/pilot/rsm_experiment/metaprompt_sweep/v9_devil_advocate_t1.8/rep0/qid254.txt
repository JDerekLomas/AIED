As a UK maths teacher, I have seen this exact type of question trip up even confident students. 

The presence of the **0** is the first hurdle. Many students mistakenly believe that since 0 doesn't add to the sum, it shouldn't be counted in the divisor (Option C). Others correctly identify that 0 must be included in the count, leading them to Option A, which is the correct mathematical expression.

However, the real "trap" here is **Option B**. This is the "calculator error" representation. Students often type $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 \div 5$ into a scientific calculator exactly as written. Due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), the calculator only divides the 7 by 5. Because this looks like a "logical" linear way to write the sum, it is an incredibly common misconception, even among students who know how to calculate a mean in their heads.

Here is the predicted distribution based on these common misconceptions:

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=40% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=30% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
