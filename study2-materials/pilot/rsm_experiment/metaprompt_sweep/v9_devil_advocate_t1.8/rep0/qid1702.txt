To predict the performance on this question, we must look at the specific points where students at different levels typically fail:

1.  **Substitution into expressions with negative coefficients:** The $-6y$ term is a major hurdle. When $y = 0.5$, students must calculate $10x - 3 = 30$.
2.  **Inverse operations:** A significant number of students will subtract 3 instead of adding 3 ($10x = 27$ vs $10x = 33$). This leads directly to Option D ($2.7$).
3.  **Basic arithmetic vs. Equation logic:** Some students may simply perform operations on the numbers present (e.g., $30 \div 6 = 5$, then $10x - 5 = \dots$) or confuse $x$ and $y$.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A (3.3):** Correct. $10x - 3 = 30 \implies 10x = 33 \implies x = 3.3$.
*   **D (2.7):** The "Inverse Error." Students do $30 - 3$ instead of $30 + 3$. This is the most common distractor for mid-ability students.
*   **C (4.25) / B (-4.25):** These occur when students substitute $x=0.5$ instead of $y=0.5$ ($5 - 6y = 30 \implies -6y = 25 \implies y \approx -4.16$), or mismanage the division of 30 by 6 and 10.
