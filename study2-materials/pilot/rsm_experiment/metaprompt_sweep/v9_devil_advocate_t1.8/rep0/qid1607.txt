To accurately predict student performance on this question, we must look beyond the simple algebra and focus on "operational pitfalls." 

Step 1 is mathematically sound (multiplying both sides by 4). However, Step 2 contains a classic "sign-change error" or "inverse operation confusion." A student sees the $+1$ and, in their rush to move it to the other side, adds it to the $60$ instead of subtracting it. 

Experienced teachers know that many students judge the "correctness" of steps based on whether the final answer "looks right" or if the first step "looks familiar." Many proficient students will blink and miss the error in Step 2 because they are focused on the successful clearing of the fraction in Step 1.
