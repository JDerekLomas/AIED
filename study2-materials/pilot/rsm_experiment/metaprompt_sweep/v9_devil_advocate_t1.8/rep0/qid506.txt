To predict student performance on this question, we must look beyond the simple operation ($\div 3$) and consider the common misconceptions regarding fractions and algebraic manipulation.

**Misconception Analysis:**
*   **The "Multiply instead of Divide" error (Option A):** Many students at lower ability levels see $3$ and $12$ and instinctively think of $4$. They often multiply the right-hand side by $3$ ($3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}$) because they have a vague notion that the $3$ "goes into" the $12$.
*   **The "Inverse Operation" error (Option C):** Students may see $12 \div 3$ and simply ignore the fact that the $12$ is in the denominator, leading to a whole number answer.
*   **The "Denominator confusion" error (Option D):** Some students mistake $3p$ as needing the 3 to be squared or added to the 12, or try to find a common denominator unnecessarily.
*   **The Correct approach (Option B):** Dividing by $3$ is the same as multiplying by $\frac{1}{3}$. This requires a secure understanding of "keep, change, flip" or the multiplicative inverse.
