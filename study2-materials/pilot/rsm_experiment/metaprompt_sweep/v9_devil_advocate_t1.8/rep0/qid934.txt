In evaluating this question, a teacher's first instinct is that it is a simple case of substituting $x=0$. However, students frequently struggle with linear equations in implicit form ($ax + by = c$) compared to $y = mx + c$. 

The most common "trap" here is the relationship between the coefficients and the constant. 
1. **The "Everything is Added" error:** A significant number of lower-ability students will simply add all visible numbers: $4 + 2 + 10 = 16$ (not an option) or think $4(0) + 2 + y = 10 \rightarrow y=8$.
2. **The "Divide by 4" error (Option D):** Many students see $4x$ and $10$ and perform $10 \div 4 = 2.5$, ignoring the $2y$ entirely or assuming $y$ is the coefficient.
3. **The "Coefficient Confusion" (Option B):** Students see the $2$ next to the $y$ and either guess it or perform $10 - 4 - 3$ type logic.
4. **Correct Logic (Option C):** $4(0) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 10 \rightarrow y = 5$.

The star being at $x=0$ actually makes this harder for some, as they look for a pattern in the (empty) table rather than using the equation provided.
