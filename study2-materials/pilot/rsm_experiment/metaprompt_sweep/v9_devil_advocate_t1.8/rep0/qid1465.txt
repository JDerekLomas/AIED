To accurately predict student performance on this BIDMAS/order of operations question, we must look past our mathematical fluency and consider common student misconceptions:

1.  **The Multiplication Priority:** Most students know to do $4 \times 2 = 8$ first.
2.  **The Left-to-Right "Reading" Error:** This is the primary pitfall. Students calculate $3 - 5 + 8$. Many incorrectly assume "Addition comes before Subtraction" because the 'A' appears before the 'S' in BIDMAS/BODMAS. They perform $5 + 8 = 13$ first, leading to $3 - 13 = -10$ (Option D).
3.  **Linear Processing:** Low-ability students ignore BIDMAS entirely and work left-to-right: $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$ (Option B).
4.  **Negative Number Struggles:** Students reaching the stage $3 - 5 + 8$ may correctly get $-2 + 8$, but then struggle with the directed number calculation, occasionally reaching $6$ (Option A) by chance or mistake.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=5% D=55%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=0% D=40%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=0% D=6%
