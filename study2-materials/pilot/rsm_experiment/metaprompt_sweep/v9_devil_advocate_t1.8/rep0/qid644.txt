To predict these percentages, I must account for common misconceptions regarding directed numbers and the distinction between multiplying and adding. 

Students often correctly identify that a "minus times a minus is a plus," but those at lower ability levels frequently default to addition (performing $-1 - 4$ or $-1 + -4$ to get $-5$) because the term "expanding brackets" is mentally associated with "combining" numbers. There is also a significant group who will simply ignore the sign of the 1, treating the operation as $1 \times -4$ to get $-4$.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
