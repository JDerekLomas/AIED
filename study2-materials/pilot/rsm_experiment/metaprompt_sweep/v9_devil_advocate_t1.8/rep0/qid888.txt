In evaluating this question, a teacher might assume "B" is obvious because $(m-5)(m-7)$ is a standard GCSE foundation-level task. However, experience shows that negative signs are the single greatest source of error in expansion. 

The primary pitfalls are:
1. **The Double Negative:** Students often forget that $-5 \times -7 = +35$. This makes D a very strong distractor for those who associate the minus signs in the brackets with a minus sign in the result.
2. **Summing Signs:** Students frequently struggle with $-5 - 7$. Those who calculate this as $-2$ (subtracting the smaller from the larger) will pick A. Those who simply add the numbers but ignore the negatives may pick C.

Here is the predicted distribution based on these common misconceptions:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
