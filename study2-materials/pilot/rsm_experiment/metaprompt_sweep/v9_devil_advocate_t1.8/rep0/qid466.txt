To predict the performance on this question, we must look beyond the simple rule of reciprocals. While an advanced student sees the relationship \(x \cdot \frac{1}{x} = 1\) immediately, many students struggle with the interplay between the negative sign in the question and the negative sign required (or not) in the answer.

The most common trap is the "negative balance" misconception: students often believe that because the result is negative (\(-1\)), the multiplier should also be negative (Choice B), failing to realize that "negative times positive equals negative." There is also a strong "identity" lure toward Choice C from students who remember the numbers involved but forget how fractions manipulate to reach 1.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

**below_basic:** A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
(At this level, responses are almost random. Many will choose B because "the question has negatives, so the answer should be negative," or D because they think the star must be the same as the starting number to keep the digits consistent.)

**basic:** A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%
(Students here recognize the need for the reciprocal \(4/3\), but the majority will fall for the sign trap. They see the negative result and instinctively reach for the negative fraction (B), forgetting that two negatives would result in a positive 1.)

**proficient:** A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
(These students generally understand the reciprocal rule. A significant minority will still make a "silly mistake" with the signs, but the majority will correctly identify that a positive multiplier is needed to keep the product negative.)

**advanced:** A=92% B=5% C=2% D=1%
(High-achieving students will process the arithmetic and the sign rules simultaneously with high accuracy, though a very small percentage may rush and select B by mistake.)

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=05% C=02% D=01%
