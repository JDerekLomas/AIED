As an experienced teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle Order of Operations. The "hidden trap" here is not Problem Q (where BIDMAS/BODMAS is generally well-memorised), but Problem P. 

Students are taught "Addition before Subtraction" (A before S in BIDMAS) as a literal rule, rather than understanding that they carry equal priority and should be worked left-to-right. This leads even proficient students to believe they must do $5 + 6$ first in Problem P.

Here is my prediction of the percentage breakdown based on common misconceptions:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=45% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=35% D=30%
proficient: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
advanced: A=35% B=60% C=2% D=3%
