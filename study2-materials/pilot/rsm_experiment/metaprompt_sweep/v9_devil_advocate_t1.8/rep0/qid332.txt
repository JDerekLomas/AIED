In my experience teaching KS3 and GCSE, this specific two-step equation is a classic "trap" for students. 

**Tom** is correct because adding 5 to both sides is the standard, intuitive first step. Most students across all ability levels will recognise this.

**Katie** is incorrect because she has multiplied only the $x/3$ and the $12$ by 3, forgetting to multiply the $-5$. This is the single most common conceptual error when students attempt to "clear the fraction" first. Even many high-ability students make this mistake if they are rushing or if they haven't been taught to multiply *every term* in the equation.

The "trap" in this question is that B and C will be very popular choices for students who don't fully understand that "balancing an equation" means applying the operation to the entire side (all terms), not just the fraction and the answer.
