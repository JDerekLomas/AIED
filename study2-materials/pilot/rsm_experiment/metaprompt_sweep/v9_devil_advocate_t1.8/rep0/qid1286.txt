To predict the performance on this question, we must consider the algebraic manipulation required to rearrange $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

While the formula for the volume of a sphere is provided in most UK GCSE formula sheets, many students struggle with multi-step subjects of formulae, particularly when fractions and $\pi$ are involved. 

Common pitfalls include:
1. **The "Coefficient" Trap:** Students often try to move the $\frac{4}{3}$ by multiplying by 4 and dividing by 3 (Option A/B) because they see the 4 on top and the 3 on the bottom and don't correctly apply the inverse operation ($V \div \frac{4}{3} = V \times \frac{3}{4}$).
2. **The Cube Root Scope:** Some students correctly identify the cube root but fail to realize it must encapsulate the entire expression, or they isolate $V$ and leave $\pi$ outside.
3. **Symbol Confusion:** Lower-ability students often select the option that looks "most like" the formula they memorized, often leading them to Option A.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=45% B=25% C=15% D=15%
*(Below basic students often pick the option that keeps 4 and $\pi$ in the numerator as they appear in the standard formula, or they guess based on visual complexity.)*

basic: A=35% B=30% C=25% D=10%
*(Basic students often struggle with the reciprocal nature of dividing by a fraction; they know a cube root is involved but commonly choose B or A because they "move" the numbers incorrectly.)*

proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
*(Proficient students are generally capable of the three-step rearrangement: multiply by 3, divide by $4\pi$, then cube root. Their errors are usually rushed misreads.)*

advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
*(Advanced students see this as a standard 1-minute mark-earner and will rarely make a mistake, though a few might misclick Option B if rushing.)*
