As a UK maths teacher, I have seen hundreds of students approach this specific structure of equation. At first glance, it looks trivial, but the "variable in the denominator" is a notorious hurdle.

Students at lower ability levels often default to "Operation Intuition": they see a 10 and a 5 and assume the answer must be 2 ($10 \div 5$) or 50 ($10 \times 5$). They often ignore the structure of the fraction entirely. Even stronger students can fall into the "Division Trap," mentally calculating $10 \div 5$ because they are used to the larger number being the dividend. The most common error is choosing C, assuming $p = 10 \div 5$.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=55% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=28% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=4% D=0%
