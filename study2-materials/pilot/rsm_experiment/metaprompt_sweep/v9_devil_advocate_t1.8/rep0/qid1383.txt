As a UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle powers and directed numbers. At first glance, this looks like a "check" question, but the combination of a negative base and an even exponent is a notorious "trap" area.

Even "proficient" students frequently fall victim to the calculator error (typing $-3^4$ without brackets) or a cognitive lapse where they see the minus sign and feel it should persist in the final answer. Lower-ability students often default to multiplication ($k \times 4$) rather than exponentiation.

Here is my prediction of the performance distribution:

**below_basic:** A=10% B=45% C=10% D=35%
*At this level, "4" is treated as a multiplier. Students will calculate $-3 \times 4 = -12$ or ignore the sign for $3 \times 4 = 12$. The concept of an exponent is not yet secure.*

**basic:** A=30% B=15% C=40% D=15%
*These students know $3^4 = 81$, but the rules of negative indices are shaky. Many believe that because the input is negative, the output must be negative, leading them to C.*

**proficient:** A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
*Most get it right, but a significant portion (roughly 1 in 4) will make a "sign error." This is often due to over-reliance on non-bracketed calculator input or a flawed mental rule that "negative stays negative."*

**advanced:** A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
*High-achieving students internalize that an even power results in a positive value. Errors here are rare and usually down to extreme haste.*
