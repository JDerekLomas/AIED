Here is the predicted breakdown for a typical Year 9 class, based on common misconceptions regarding negative bases and index laws.

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
**The Reasoning:** These students will likely ignore the power entirely and perform a linear operation. $k$ is $-3$ and there is a $4$, so they will either do $-3 \times 4 = -12$ (Option D) or simply $3 \times 4 = 12$ (Option B). They treat the exponent as a multiplier.

basic: A=20% B=5% C=65% D=10%
**The Reasoning:** These students know they need to multiply $-3$ by itself four times. However, there is a deep-rooted "negative in the question means negative in the answer" instinct. They will calculate $3^4 = 81$ but then incorrectly apply the sign rule, thinking that because the base is negative, the result must be negative. They fail to track the pairs of negatives cancelling out.

proficient: A=60% B=0% C=40% D=0%
**The Reasoning:** These students are confident with indices but are currently battling with the "calculator vs. brain" paradox. Many will get -81 (Option C) because they are thinking of how their scientific calculator reacts when they type $-3^4$ without brackets. They understand the math, but they haven't quite mastered the notation rule that $(-3)^4 \neq -3^4$.

advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
**The Reasoning:** These students will immediately recognise that an even power turns any real base positive. The only ones who will get it wrong (Option C) are those working too quickly who make a "silly" sign error, despite knowing the rule.
