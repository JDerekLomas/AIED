To a Year 9 class, this is a classic "trap" question. The common misconception is that the operation is $10 \times 5$ or $10 \div 5$, rather than understanding the inverse operations required when the unknown is in the denominator.

**The Logic of the Errors:**
*   **A ($p=0.5$):** This is the correct answer. Proficient students will multiply by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, then divide by 10.
*   **B ($p=50$):** Students see a '10' and a '5' and a division sign. Their instinct is to multiply the numbers they see to "undo" the fraction ($10 \times 5$). 
*   **C ($p=2$):** This will be the most common wrong answer. Students intuitively see $10$ and $5$ and perform the division $10 \div 5$. They overlook the fact that the variable $p$ is on the bottom, essentially solving $10 = p/5$ instead of $5/p$.
*   **D:** Only the most frustrated or confused students will pick this, assuming the equation is "impossible" because 10 is bigger than 5.

Here is how I predict my 30 students will split based on their current attainment levels:

below_basic: A=05% B=30% C=60% D=05%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=70% D=00%
proficient: A=70% B=05% C=25% D=00%
advanced: A=95% B=00% C=05% D=00%
