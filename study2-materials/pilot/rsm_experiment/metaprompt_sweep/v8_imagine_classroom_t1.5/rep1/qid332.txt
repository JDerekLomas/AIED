To give you context for these predictions, here is how I expect the classroom to react to this specific problem:

Most Year 9s will immediately see Tom’s logic (adding 5 to both sides) because "the minus 5 is at the end" and it feels like the natural first step of a two-step equation. 

The real test is Katie. **Basic and Proficient** students often struggle with the distributive property of multiplication over an entire side of an equation. They see "$\times 3$" as something that only applies to the fraction, forgetting that to maintain equality, the $-5$ must also be multiplied. This is a classic "order of operations" vs "inverse operations" misconception. 

**Advanced** students will pause. They’ll realise that while Tom’s way is *standard*, Katie’s way is mathematically legal *if* done correctly, but they will spot that she missed the $-5$.

Here is my predicted distribution for my 30 students:

below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=0% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%

**Why they will get it wrong:**
*   **The "Katie" Trap (Choice C):** About 4-5 students (mostly basic/below basic) will pick **C**. They know that "multiply by 3" is the opposite of "divide by 3," and they will think Katie is being "clever" by doing that first. They won't notice that she didn't multiply the $-5$ by $3$. They see math as a series of disconnected "moves" rather than a balanced scale.
*   **The "Safe" Bet (Choice A):** This will be the majority. Tom is undeniably right. For many, once they see Tom is right, they will look at Katie’s work, see it looks "messy" or "wrong" because it doesn't follow the 2-step flow they memorised, and dismiss her. 
*   **The Careful Skeptic (Choice D):** A couple of my high-fliers might overthink it. They might misread the question or assume there's a trick where *both* are wrong, especially if they rush the mental arithmetic and think $12 + 5$ isn't $17$.
