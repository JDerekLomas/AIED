Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9 class of 30, based on their typical traps with BIDMAS and directed numbers.

**Teacher’s Insight:**
*   **The "Left-to-Right" Trap (C & D):** Many "basic" students still ignore order of operations when the numbers are small, treating it like a sentence. $3-5$ is $-2$, $+4$ is $2$, $\times 2$ is **4**. Or, they’ll lose the negative sign entirely: $3-5$ becomes $2$, $+4$ is $6$, $\times 2$ is **12**.
*   **The "Addition First" Trap (D):** This is the classic "A comes before S in BIDMAS" error. Students like **Leo** and **Chloe** will see $5+4$ and do that first. They'll calculate $3 - 9 \times 2 \rightarrow 3 - 18 = -15$ (not listed) or, more likely, $(3-5+4) \times 2 = 4$, or $3 - (5+8) = -10$.
*   **The Directed Number Slip (B):** Some "proficient" students will correctly do $4 \times 2 = 8$ and then write $3 - 5 + 8$. However, they’ll mentally process $5 + 8$ first because the minus sign feels like it "belongs" to the sum, resulting in $3 - 13 = -10$, or they'll trip on $3-5$ and call it $2$, then $2+8=10$ (not listed).
*   **The Correct Logic (A):** The advanced students know $3 - 5 + 8$ is $6$.

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=30% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=0% D=20%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
