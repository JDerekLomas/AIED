Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9 class. I've categorised them based on their current working level, focusing on the specific misconceptions I see day-in, day-out regarding BIDMAS and place value with decimals.

**Analysis of the errors:**
*   **The "Double the Power" mistake (C):** The weakest students see $0.3$ and $^2$ and instantly think "double it" to get $0.6$, then multiply by $3$ to get $1.8$.
*   **The "Squaring Decimal" trap (A):** Mid-range students remember to square first, but they think $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ (forgetting the second decimal place). Then $0.9 \times 0.9 = 0.81$ or they simply misplace the point.
*   **The "Incorrect Order" error (B):** This is common in my middle sets. They do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, then square the $0.9$ to get $0.81$. Alternatively, they do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, then square $0.3$ to get $0.09$ and then add/mix digits to end up at $0.27$ but miss a decimal place.
