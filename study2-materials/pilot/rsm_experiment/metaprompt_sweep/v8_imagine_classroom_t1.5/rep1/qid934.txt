Here is my prediction for our Year 9 class of 30 students.

**The "Below Basic" group (approx. 6 students):** These students struggle with the abstract nature of $x$ and $y$. When they see $4x+2y=10$ and $x=0$, they won't substitute; they will look for an arithmetic pattern. They'll see the numbers 4, 2, and 10 and assume the answer must be 20 ($2 \times 10$) or 5 ($10 \div 2$). A few will see "4" and "0" and try to add them to 10. They are guessing based on the numbers visible in the equation rather than the relationship between them.

**The "Basic" group (approx. 10 students):** These students know $x=0$ means the $4x$ part "disappears," but they will crumble at the two-step logic. Many will see $2y=10$ and instinctively pick 5. However, a significant portion will fall for the "visual cue" trap: they see $x=0$ and $4x+2y=10$, and their brain short-circuits into thinking the answer must be 10 or, more likely, they'll multiply the 4 and the 5 and somehow land on 20. 

**The "Proficient" group (approx. 9 students):** These students will correctly substitute $x=0$. They will write down $2y=10$ on their mini-whiteboards. Most will get to $y=5$ easily. The few who miss it will be over-complicating it, perhaps trying to rearrange the whole equation into $y=mx+c$ first and making a sign error or dividing the 10 by 4 instead of 2.

**The "Advanced" group (approx. 5 students):** These students will solve it in their heads in three seconds. They recognise this as the $y$-intercept. There is a very small risk one might rush and pick 2.5 because they accidentally divided 10 by 4 (finding the $x$-intercept instead), but generally, they will find this trivial.

proficient: A=0% B=5% C=85% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
