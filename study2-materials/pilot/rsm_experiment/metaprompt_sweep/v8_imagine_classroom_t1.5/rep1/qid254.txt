Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30 students.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**

*   **The Zero Trap (Option C):** This is the most common pitfall. Many students in the "Basic" and "Below Basic" groups subconsciously treat zero as "nothing." When they see "how many numbers are there?", their brain skips the zero and counts four digits. This is a persistent misconception that zero doesn't "count" as a value in a dataset.
*   **The Calculator/BODMAS Trap (Option B):** Students who are becoming more confident with their scientific calculators often forget that the division line in a fraction acts as a grouping symbol. They will look at Option B and think, "That's exactly what I type into my Casio," forgetting that without brackets, the calculator will only divide the 7 by 5.
*   **The "Invisible Zero" (Option A):** This is the correct answer, but it's "tricky" because the zero isn't in the numerator. My "Proficient" students will spot that $0+1+3+4+7$ is the same as $1+3+4+7$ and that the denominator must be 5. My "Advanced" students will check for BODMAS errors in B and count the terms for A, getting it right instantly.

below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=50% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=15% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
