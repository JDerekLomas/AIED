Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9s.

The "Below Basic" group will likely rush and see $60$ and $61$ as a logical sequence, missing the inverse operation entirely. The "Basic" group often struggles with the jump from Step 1 to Step 2 because they have a "keyword" memory of "do the same to both sides" but default to addition whenever they see a subtraction needed (or vice versa), simply because they want the numbers to "group together" into a rounder-looking result.

**The Breakdown:**
*   **A (Correct):** Students like **Maya and Leo** (Proficient) will spot the error immediately. They know $60-1=59$.
*   **C (The Trap):** Students like **Harvey** (Basic) will get this wrong. He’ll see $15 \times 4 = 60$ and think "Brilliant, Step 1 is right." Then he'll see $60$ and $1$ and his brain will instinctively add them to get $61$ because he’s used to equations "building up" rather than isolating the variable. He won't check the inverse.
*   **B/D:** Very few will pick these; once they see $15 \times 4 = 60$, they are convinced Step 1 is solid.

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=5% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=0% C=15% D=0%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
