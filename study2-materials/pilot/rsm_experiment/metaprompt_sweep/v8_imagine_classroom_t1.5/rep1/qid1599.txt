In this Year 9 class, the "Basic" and "Below Basic" groups often struggle with the visual hierarchy of fractions and the preservation of the denominator as a single unit.

**Predicting the errors:**
*   **The "Top-Heavy" error (D):** Many students in the lower sets have a subconscious habit of putting the "longer" expression or the one with the plus sign on the top because it looks more "natural" to them, or they simply forget that the dividend (the first term) must be the numerator.
*   **The "Detached Constant" error (C):** Students like *Leo* or *Mia* often treat the "+4" as an afterthought. They see $c \div h$ and write it as a fraction, then just "tack on" the $+4$ at the end, neglecting the brackets entirely because they don't see the division bar as a grouping symbol.
*   **The "Transcription" error (B):** A few students will get distracted by the $+4$ and assume it must apply to both parts of the fraction to make it look "balanced."

Here is the predicted distribution based on their current progress in the Algebra unit:

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=5% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=0% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
