Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30 students.

**Teacher's Insight:**
The challenge here isn't the formula—it's the algebraic manipulation under pressure. 
*   **The "Multiplying" Error (A):** Students like **Leo** and **Mia** often see the fraction $4/3$ and instinctively multiply $V$ by the numerator ($4V$) and then the $\pi$, forgetting that to "move" a multiplier across the equals sign, you must divide. 
*   **The "Messy Algebra" Error (B):** **Chloe** will get halfway there. She’ll correctly move the $\pi$, but get the fraction $4/3$ flipped the wrong way during the division process. 
*   **The "Visual Pattern" Error (D):** My lower-attaining students might be intimidated by the cube root symbol over a fraction. They see the $3$ and $4\pi$ separated in D and it "looks" cleaner to them, so they'll guess that one.
*   **The Success (C):** **Sam** and **Arjun** will sketch the equation $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ and step through it methodically: multiply by 3, divide by $4\pi$, then cube root.
