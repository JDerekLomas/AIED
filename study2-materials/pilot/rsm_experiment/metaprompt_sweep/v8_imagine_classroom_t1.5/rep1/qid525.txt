To predict this distribution, I have to account for the typical Year 9 "hazards": the temptation of adding straight across (D), the failure to read the "mixed number" instruction (A), and the common mistake of multiplying denominators to find a common one but forgetting to scale the numerators correctly.

**The Breakdown:**

*   **D is the "Trap" for lower ability:** Students like Chloe and Jack will instinctively add the whole numbers (2+2=4) and then just add the numerators and denominators (7+1=8, 10+4=14). It feels efficient to them, and seeing "4" at the start of the option confirms their bias.
*   **A is the "Instruction Blind" mistake:** My middle-to-high flyers, like Sam, will do all the heavy lifting correctly—converting to improper fractions, finding the common denominator of 20, adding them to get 99/20—but they will stop there. They get so focused on the arithmetic that they ignore the "Leave your answer as a mixed number" instruction.
*   **C is the "Denominator Mismatch":** Some will find 40 as a common denominator (10x4) but then struggle with the cross-multiplication or just leave it as 40 without simplifying.
