Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9 class. 

Even though this looks like a simple "last term" multiplication, the presence of two negative signs and the cognitive load of expanding brackets often leads to two specific errors: the "Additive Error" (adding instead of multiplying) and the "Sign Error" (ignoring the double negative).

**Predicting the "Why":**
*   **The "C" and "D" students:** These are my students who see the numbers 1 and 4 and their brains immediately default to addition because they are overwhelmed by the bracket notation. They see $-1$ and $-4$ and think "$-1 - 4 = -5$" or just "1 + 4 = 5". This is a classic "operation slip."
*   **The "B" students:** These students know to multiply ($1 \times 4 = 4$), but they have a shaky grasp of directed numbers. They see the minus signs and think "negative and negative stays negative" or simply forget to carry the sign across.
*   **The "A" students:** These are my proficient and advanced learners who have internalized the FOIL/Grid method and the "two negatives make a positive" rule for multiplication.

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
