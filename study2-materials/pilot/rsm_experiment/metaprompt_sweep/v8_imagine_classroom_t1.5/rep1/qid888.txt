Here is my prediction for the Year 9 class based on typical misconceptions regarding directed numbers and expanding binomials.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The "Signs are Hard" group (Option D):** This is the most common error. Students like Jack and Sarah correctly calculate $7 + 5 = 12$ and $7 \times 5 = 35$, but their brains register "minus" at the start of the problem and simply carry it through to the end. They forget that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive.
*   **The "Difference" group (Option A):** Students like Leo will rush. They see 5 and 7 and find the difference (2) rather than the sum (12) for the middle term.
*   **The "Double Negative Confusion" (Option C):** Chloe might think "two minuses make a plus" and apply it over-zealously to both the middle term (the addition) and the end term (the multiplication).

**Predicted Distribution:**

basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=0% D=2%
