To give you my honest prediction for my Year 9s: many will see the numbers 3 and 12 and their brains will "shortcut" to 4 without actually performing the inverse operation. They often treat fractions as a signal to simplify rather than an object to be divided.

Here is the predicted distribution based on their typical misconceptions:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
**The Reasoning:** Students like **Jayden** or **Kayla** will see the 3 and 12 and immediately think "3 fits into 12 four times." They aren't looking at the structure; they are looking for a whole-number relationship. They'll pick **C** because it feels "cleanest." If they feel it must be a fraction because the question has one, they'll pick **A**.

basic: A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
**The Reasoning:** Students like **Harvey** know they need to "do something with the 3," but they’ll divide 12 by 3 instead of dividing $1/12$ by 3. They understand the inverse operation is division, but they lose the "fractional" nature of the $1/12$ and just process the denominators. **A** is the "common sense" trap here.

proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
**The Reasoning:** Most of the mid-set, like **Chloe** or **Sam**, will remember to "divide by 3." However, a good chunk will still slip up and do $12 \div 3$ to get $1/4$. Those who remember that dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying the denominator (or multiplying by $1/3$) will successfully land on **B**.

advanced: A=5% B=95% C=0% D=0%
**The Reasoning:** My top-end students like **Alice** will breeze through this, but even there, one student might work too quickly, see "3 and 12," and circle **A** by mistake before moving on to the harder stuff.

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=95% C=0% D=0%
