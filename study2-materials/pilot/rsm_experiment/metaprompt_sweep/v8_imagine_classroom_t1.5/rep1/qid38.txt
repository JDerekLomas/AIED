To give you my prediction for this Year 9 class, I’m looking at the specific hurdles this question presents: the "invisible" 1 in front of $x$ and the "add the tops, add the bottoms" trap that haunts even the brightest kids when they are rushing.

**The Predicted Breakdown:**

**Below Basic (6 students):** These students are still terrified of fractions. Their first instinct is to add straight across. They see $3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$. They won't even look for a common denominator because their brains want the simplest path out of the problem. 
**Basic (10 students):** These students know they need a common denominator, but they get "variable vertigo." They will successfully change the $4/x$ to $8/2x$, but in the final step, they will add the denominators together to get $11/4x$ (which isn't an option, so they'll panic-pivot to B or D) or they will simply pick D because they added the numerators but forgot to double the 4.
**Proficient (10 students):** Most will get the right answer (A). However, a significant chunk will do the cross-multiplication method $(3x + 8x) / 2x^2$. They'll get $11x/2x^2$ and then fail to simplify the $x$ correctly, leading them to guess C or gravitate back to A through luck.
**Advanced (4 students):** They will see the $2x$ common denominator instantly and spend 5 seconds on the question. They are the only ones guaranteed to avoid the "add the bottoms" reflex.

basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=80% B=0% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
