Here is the predicted distribution for a typical mixed-ability Year 9 class of 30 students.

The primary hurdle here isn't the calculation, but the rigid misapplication of the **BIDMAS/BODMAS** acronym. Students are often taught "Addition before Subtraction" because A comes before S in the acronym, unaware that they carry equal priority and should be solved left-to-right.

**Predicting the errors:**
*   **The "BIDMAS Zombies" (The most common error):** Students like **Tyler and Chloe** (working at 'Basic' level) have had "Addition before Subtraction" drilled into them. They will look at Problem P and think they *must* do $5+6$ first because "A comes before S." This leads them straight to Option D.
*   **The Left-to-Right Instict:** Students like **Leo** (Below Basic) will often ignore order of operations entirely and just work left-to-right for both, leading them to Option A.
*   **The Over-thinkers:** Some 'Proficient' students will hesitate. They know multiplication comes first (Problem Q), but they've been burnt by the Addition/Subtraction rule before. Half will stick to the left-to-right rule for P, the other half will fall into the BIDMAS trap.
*   **The High-Flyers:** Students like **Amira and Isaac** (Advanced) understand that Addition and Subtraction are inverse operations of equal priority and will instinctively choose B.

below_basic: A=50% B=10% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=10% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=55% C=5% D=35%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
