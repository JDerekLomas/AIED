Based on my experience with Year 9, many students will struggle with the negative coefficient and the decimal.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The 'Rearranging' Trap (Choice C):** Students like **Tyler and Chloe** will try to rearrange the equation to $y=mx+c$ first because that's how we practiced it last week. They'll likely mess up the signs, getting $10x = 30 + 3$ (where the 3 comes from $6 \times 0.5$). They'll reach $10x = 33$, leading them to $3.3$. 
*   **The 'Subtraction' Error (Choice D):** Students like **Leo** will correctly find that $6 \times 0.5 = 3$, but they'll then mentally calculate $10x = 30 - 3$ instead of $30 + 3$. They see a minus sign in the original equation and intuitively think "subtract" when moving it across the equals sign. $27 \div 10 = 2.7$.
*   **The 'Negative' Guess (Choice B):** A few struggling students see the minus in the equation and just assume the answer must be negative because "it looks harder."
