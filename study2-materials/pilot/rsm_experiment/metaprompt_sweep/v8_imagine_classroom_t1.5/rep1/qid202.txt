Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9 class of 30, based on their typical misconceptions with mixed numbers and fraction addition.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **A (Correct):** Most students will see this as "easy" and simply add the whole numbers and then the numerators.
*   **B (Improper Fraction):** These are my "rule-followers" (like **Leo** or **Sarah**). They’ve been drilled to convert everything to improper fractions before calculating. They will get $11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$ correctly, but they won't read the final instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number." They’ll think they've finished.
*   **C (The "Add Everything" Error):** This is for the students who are still shaky on denominators (like **Jayden**). They will add $2+1$, $1+2$, AND $5+5$. It feels intuitively symmetrical to them to add the bottom numbers.
*   **D (The Denominator Doubler):** This is a specific trap for students who overthink. They know the whole number is 3 and the numerator is 3, but they have a lingering "rule" in their head that something *must* happen to the denominator when you have two of them, often defaulting to addition.

**Predicted Distribution:**

below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
