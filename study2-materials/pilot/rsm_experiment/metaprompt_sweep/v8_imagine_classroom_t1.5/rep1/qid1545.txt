Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9 class of 30, based on their typical misconceptions with BIDMAS (order of operations) and their tendency to read expressions left-to-right.

**Teacher's Insight:** 
The left side ($8 + 12 \div 4 = 11$) is the "trap." Students like *Leo* and *Chloe* will almost certainly add 8 and 12 first to get 20, then divide by 4 to get 5. On the right side ($ (8 + 12) \div 4 = 5 $), the brackets explicitly tell them to do what they already wanted to do. Consequently, a large portion of the middle-attaining group will conclude that $5 = 5$ and pick **C**. 

The advanced students will correctly identify that division happens first on the left ($12 \div 4 = 3$; $8+3=11$), making the left side larger. However, even my "proficient" students often rush and assume the brackets are just there to "show the work" rather than change the value.

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=80% D=0%
basic: A=20% B=5% C=75% D=0%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=40% D=0%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
