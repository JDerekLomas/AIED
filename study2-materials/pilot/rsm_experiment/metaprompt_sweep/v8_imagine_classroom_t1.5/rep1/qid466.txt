Based on my experience with Year 9 classes, this question is a classic "sign vs. reciprocal" trap. Many students understand that they need to flip the fraction to get to 1, but they consistently struggle with how the negative sign interacts with the product—especially when they see a negative result and assume the multiplier must also be negative.

Here is the predicted distribution for a typical mixed-ability class of 30:

**below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%**
*   **Why they get it wrong:** These students see the negative sign in the question and the negative result, so their "pattern recognition" tells them everything in the sum should be negative, leading them to **B**. Others (**C**) have a vague memory that negatives should "cancel out" but don't understand how, or they simply pick the number already in the question (**D**) because they are overwhelmed by the fractions.

**basic: A=30% B=50% C=15% D=5%**
*   **Why they get it wrong:** This group is the most likely to fall for the **B** trap. They have learned that to get 1, you flip the fraction (reciprocals), so they feel confident. However, their internal logic says "the answer is negative, so the number I multiply by must be negative." They forget that a negative times a negative produces a positive. They prioritize the "flipping" rule over the "integer sign" rule.

**proficient: A=65% B=30% C=5% D=0%**
*   **Why they get it wrong:** Most of these students will get **A** correct. Those who miss it will almost exclusively pick **B**. Their mistake is usually a "slip" under pressure—they calculate the reciprocal correctly but second-guess the sign at the last second because the result is $-1$. They over-complicate the logic: "It's negative, I need to keep it negative, so I'll use a negative."

**advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%**
*   **Why they get it wrong:** These students should find this trivial. The 5% who get it wrong (picking **B**) are simply rushing and didn't perform the mental check: "$- \times + = -$". They see a negative answer and reflexively tick the negative option.
