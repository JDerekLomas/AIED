Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9 class of 30, based on their typical misconceptions with rearranging formulae involving fractions and powers.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The Option A Trap:** This is my most common error. Students like **Jack** and **Chloe** know that $V$, $4$, $\pi$, and $3$ are all involved. Instead of "undoing" the fraction by multiplying by $3$, they visually "clump" the $4$, $\pi$, and $3$ together and move them as a block, or they mistakenly try to multiply the volume by the fraction $4/3$ rather than its reciprocal.
*   **The Option B Confusion:** Students like **Leo** often remember to divide by $\pi$ first, but then get stuck on the $4/3$. They see the $4$ on top and leave it there, essentially "flipping" only the $\pi$.
*   **The Option D Slip:** This is for the students who understand the cube root but lack the algebraic rigour. They see the cube root and the $3$ and $4\pi$ and pick something that "looks" like a fraction, failing to realize the cube root must cover the entire expression.
*   **The Successes (Option C):** My high flyers like **Amara** and **Sam** will work this out step-by-step ($3V = 4\pi r^3 \rightarrow 3V/4\pi = r^3$), but even they might hesitate for a second looking at the radicals.
