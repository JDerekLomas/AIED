Here is my prediction based on the common misconceptions I see in Year 9 when squaring decimals and following BIDMAS (order of operations).

**The Breakdown:**
*   **A (0.81):** This is the "Double Error" trap. Students square the 3 and the 0.3 separately ($9 \times 0.09$) or mistakenly think they need to square the entire expression $(3x)^2$ because they are rushing.
*   **B (0.27):** This is the most common error for middle-ability students. They square $0.3$ and get $0.9$ (forgetting the second decimal place) then multiply by 3. 
*   **C (1.8):** This is the "Linear Thinking" error. They calculate $3 \times 0.3$ and then double it (confusing squaring with multiplying by 2).
*   **D (2.7):** The correct answer.

**Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** My "distracted" group. They see $3, x, 2$ and just start multiplying whatever numbers they see. Many will pick C because they think "squared means double".
*   **Basic:** These students understand $y = 3x^2$ but struggle with place value in decimals. They will almost certainly do $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, then $0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$. Because $2.7$ is an option (D), they won't realize their decimal point in the first step was wrong. This makes D look correct for the wrong reason, though many will settle on B.
*   **Proficient:** These students know BIDMAS. They will write down $0.3^2 = 0.09$. However, about a third will panic when multiplying $3 \times 0.09$ and pick B because "it feels right" for a decimal multiplication.
*   **Advanced:** Most will get this right (D), but one or two "high-flyers" who overcomplicate things will fall into the $(3x)^2$ trap and pick A.

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=50% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=25% C=5% D=65%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
