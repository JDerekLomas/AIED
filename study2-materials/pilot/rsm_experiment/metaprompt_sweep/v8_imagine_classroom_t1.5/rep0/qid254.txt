Here is the predicted distribution for a typical mixed-ability Year 9 class.

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
**The "Mechanical Ignorers":** These students (like Leo and Kayleigh) have a hardwired rule in their heads: "Count the numbers you see." They see four non-zero digits and automatically divide by 4. To them, 0 is "nothing," so it doesn't count as a data point. They'll pick **C** without hesitation because it looks like a standard mean calculation.

basic: A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
**The "Shortcut Takers":** These students (like Jack and Chloe) know 0 counts as a value, so they correctly look for a denominator of 5. However, they are used to seeing 0 omitted from the sum in their own working out to save time. They see the 5 in **A** and their brains skip over the missing "0+" in the numerator because it doesn't change the total. A few will pick **B** because they read it left-to-right like a calculator, forgetting BIDMAS.

proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
**The "Process Driven":** These students (like Amira and Sam) are your solid "Grade 4/5" candidates. They know the rule: sum/count. They see the five numbers, they see the sum of the digits, and they see the division bar. They will pick **A** because, mathematically, it *does* result in the correct mean. They will view the absence of "0+" as irrelevant rather than a technical error.

advanced: A=30% B=0% C=0% D=70%
**The "Over-Thinkers":** Your top-set students (like Toby and Priya) will spot the trap. They’ll look at **B** and dismiss it because of BIDMAS (7÷5 happens first). They will look at **A** and argue that "the calculation" should explicitly show the inclusion of the 0 to be truly "correct" in a formal sense. They’ll choose **D** because they think it's a trick question about the formal definition of "summing all data points." They are the only ones who might actually be right, but for the most stressful reasons.
