Here is the predicted distribution and breakdown for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30.

**below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=30% D=45%**
*   **The "Left-to-Right" Trap:** These students will completely ignore BIDMAS/order of operations. They’ll calculate $(3-5) = -2$, then add $4$ to get $2$, then multiply by $2$ to get **B (4)**.
*   **The "Add then Subtract" Trap:** Many have "PEMDAS/BIDMAS" stuck in their head literally. They think Addition *must* come before Subtraction. They'll do $5+4=9$, then $3-9 = -6$, but since $-6$ isn't an option, they’ll panic and pick **D (-10)** because it "looks right" $(3-5 = -2, -2+4=2...)$ or they’ll do $3-(5+8) = -10$.
*   **The Multiplier:** Some will do $4 \times 2 = 8$, but then do $(3-5) \times 8 = -16$ or simply $3-(5+8)=-10$. **C (-12)** is for those who do $(3-5+4) = 2$ and somehow scramble the multiplication.

**basic: A=50% B=10% C=10% D=30%**
*   **The Negative Number Hurdle:** These students know they have to do $4 \times 2 = 8$ first. However, once they have $3 - 5 + 8$, they fall apart. A significant portion will calculate $5+8 = 13$ (treating the minus as a separator rather than a sign) and then do $3 - 13 = -10$ (**D**).
*   Those who get **A (6)** at this level often do it by accident or by counting on their fingers ($3-5 = -2$, then $-2+8 = 6$).

**proficient: A=85% B=0% C=0% D=15%**
*   These students automatically do the multiplication first. The main error here isn't the order of operations, it's the directed number calculation. If they get it wrong, it is almost exclusively **D (-10)** because they perceive the $+8$ as something to be added to the $5$ before subtracting from the $3$.

**advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%**
*   By Year 9, advanced students see $3 - 5 + 8$ as three separate terms ($+3, -5, +8$). They will likely rearrange it to $8 + 3 - 5$ in their heads to make it easier, instantly arriving at **6**. They are immune to the "Addition before Subtraction" myth.
