To give you the context for these predictions: I have about 5 students in the **'below basic'** bracket who still view fractions as four separate numbers rather than values. My **'basic'** group (around 8 students) knows the rules but panics under pressure. The **'proficient'** group (12 students) is solid but often forgets to read the final instruction. My **'advanced'** pair will find this trivial.

**Predicting the errors:**
*   **D is the "Year 7 Hangover":** Students like *Leo* and *Mia* will simply add across (2+2, 7+1, 10+4). They see a big plus sign and their brain takes the path of least resistance. 
*   **A is the "Robot Error":** *Jack* and *Sarah* have been drilled so hard on "Improper Fractions" lately that they'll convert everything, find the common denominator of 20, get 99/20, and stop there—completely ignoring the "Leave as a mixed number" instruction because they're so proud they handled the fractions correctly.
*   **C is the "Denominator Disaster":** *Chloe* will find the common denominator by multiplying 10 and 4 to get 40, but then she’ll forget to adjust the numerators or get muddled halfway through.

**The Predicted Distribution:**

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=30% B=65% C=5% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
