Here is my prediction for our Year 9 class based on our current progress with fractions.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**

*   **Option B ($\frac{18}{5}$):** This will be the "high-achiever's trap." Students like **Jack** or **Maya** often over-complicate things. They've been drilled so hard on "convert to improper fractions first" for multiplication and division that they will do all the hard work correctly, get $\frac{18}{5}$, and forget to read the last line of the instruction: "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
*   **Option D ($3 \frac{3}{10}$):** This is the classic "autopilot" error. Someone like **Leo** or **Chloe** will add the whole numbers ($2+1=3$) and the numerators ($1+2=3$) perfectly, but then their brain will switch to "addition mode" for the denominators too ($5+5=10$). It's a very common cognitive slip when they are rushing.
*   **Option C ($\frac{18}{10}$):** This will likely come from my bottom table. They’ll try to use a "cross-multiply" or "butterfly" method they saw on TikTok once, get confused, and end up adding everything in sight without a solid grasp of what a denominator actually represents.

**Predicted Distribution:**

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
