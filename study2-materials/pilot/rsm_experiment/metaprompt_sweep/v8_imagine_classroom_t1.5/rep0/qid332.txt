To predict this, I have to look at the classic "Year 9 misconceptions" surrounding two-step equations and BIDMAS.

**Tom's logic** is the "standard" method: add 5 to both sides. Most students recognize this movement because they are taught to "undo" the constant first.
**Katie's logic** is the "shortcut" mistake. She thinks she can multiply by 3 to "get rid of the fraction," but she has failed to multiply the $-5$ by 3 as well.

Here is the distribution I expect from my 30 students:

**below_basic (5 students): A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%**
These students (like *Leo* or *Chloe*) are guessing. *Leo* will see "36" and think "12 times 3 is 36, that sounds mathsy," so he’ll pick B. *Chloe* will see both look plausible and pick C because "usually in these questions, they're both right." They aren't checking the distributive property; they are looking for familiar number patterns.

**basic (10 students): A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%**
This group (*Archie, Maya, etc.*) is my "Both Tom and Katie" danger zone. They know Tom is right because they've seen $12+5=17$ a hundred times. However, they lack the conceptual depth to see why Katie is wrong. They see $x/3$ becoming $x$ and $12$ becoming $36$ and think "Yep, you can just multiply everything to clear the fraction." They forget that the $-5$ is a separate term.

**proficient (10 students): A=80% B=0% C=20% D=0%**
These students (*Sam, Jess*) will instinctively go with Tom. The reason 20% will still pick C is the "authoritative" nature of the question; they assume if Katie is making a specific claim, there must be a rule they've forgotten that makes her right. But most will realize that if you multiply by 3, you have to multiply *everything*.

**advanced (5 students): A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%**
My top-table students (*Toby, Alisha*) will spot Katie’s error immediately. They might even scoff and whisper that Katie forgot to multiply the 5 by 3 to get $x - 15 = 36$.

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=0% C=20% D=0%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
