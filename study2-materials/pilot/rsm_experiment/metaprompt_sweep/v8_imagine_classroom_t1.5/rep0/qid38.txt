To predict the outcome for my Year 9s, I have to look at the specific hurdles this question presents. 

Option **B** is the "classic" error: students who see fractions and instinctively "add across" (3+4 and 2x+x). Option **D** is the trap for students who forget to scale the numerator when find a common denominator; they see that $2x$ is the common denominator but just do $3+4$ on top. Option **A** is the correct answer ($\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}$).

Here is the predicted distribution for my 30 students:

**below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%**
These students (like *Leo* and *Chloe*) are still in the "fractions are scary" phase. They will see the addition sign and simply add everything they see. $3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$. It feels "fair" to them to treat the top and bottom the same way. A few might pick D because they know they shouldn't add the denominators but won't know how to change the 4.

**basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%**
These students (like *Jack*) know they need a common denominator, but they are prone to "half-measures." They’ll identify $2x$ as the target denominator but will only change the bottom of the second fraction, forgetting that the 4 needs to become an 8. They’ll confidently circle D. A few will still lapse into adding across (B) if they are rushing.

**proficient: A=75% B=5% C=0% D=20%**
Most of these students (like *Amira*) will correctly identify the need for equivalent fractions. However, even at this level, someone like *Sam* will make a "silly" mistake and fail to multiply the numerator of the second term, leading them to D. They know the rule, but under the pressure of a quick check, the $4$ remains a $4$.

**advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%**
Students like *Maya* and *Rohan* will see this instantly. They won't even need to write it down; they'll mentally convert $\frac{4}{x}$ to $\frac{8}{2x}$ and sum them. They might be briefly annoyed that there isn't a more challenging option involving a quadratic denominator.

basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=75% B=05% C=00% D=20%
advanced: A=100% B=00% C=00% D=00%
