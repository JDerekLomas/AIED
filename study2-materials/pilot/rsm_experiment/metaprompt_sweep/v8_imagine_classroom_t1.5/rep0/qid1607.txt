Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9s.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
The "trap" in this question isn't the algebra itself, but the transition from Step 1 to Step 2. Most students will correctly identify that multiplying by 4 is the right first move ($15 \times 4 = 60$). However, the common pitfall for the "Basic" and "Below Basic" cohorts is the **Inverse Operation Confusion**.

When they see $60 = 1 + k$, their brains are on "auto-pilot" to combine the 60 and the 1. Because the 1 is "added" to the $k$, they know they need to do something with that 1, but they will mistakenly perform the operation they *see* (addition) rather than the inverse (subtraction). They will think: *"60 and 1 makes 61, so $k$ is 61. Step 1 was right, and I just got 61 too, so Step 2 must be right."* This leads them straight to C.

My "Proficient" students will spot the sign error in Step 2, but a few will second-guess Step 1, wondering if the 1 should have been multiplied by 4 as well (a common misconception from expanding brackets).

below_basic: A=15% B=5% C=70% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=5% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
