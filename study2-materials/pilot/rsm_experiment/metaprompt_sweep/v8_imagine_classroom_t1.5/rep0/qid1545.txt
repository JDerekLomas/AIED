Here is the predicted breakdown for my Year 9 class. 

My "Below Basic" group often ignores the hierarchy of operations entirely and reads left-to-right like a sentence. My "Basic" group knows the word "BIDMAS" but treats Addition and Division with equal weight or assumes brackets always make a number larger. My "Proficient" students usually catch the trap but a few will make a mental arithmetic slip (8 + 3 = 12). My "Advanced" students will spot the structure immediately without even calculating.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The Left-to-Right Trap:** Students like *Tyler* or *Kyra* will calculate the left side as $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$. When they see the right side is also $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$, they will instantly pick "C" because it looks symmetrical to them.
*   **The "Brackets are Bigger" Instinct:** Several students have a subconscious bias that adding brackets to an expression makes the result larger because it "groups things together." This leads them to pick "B" without calculating.
*   **The "11 vs 5" calculation:** Those who correctly get $11$ on the left and $5$ on the right will occasionally hesitate because they expect the "messier" looking side (the one with brackets) to result in the higher value.

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=70% D=0%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=50% D=0%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=15% D=0%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
