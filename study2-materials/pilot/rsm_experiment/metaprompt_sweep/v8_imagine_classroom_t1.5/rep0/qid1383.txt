Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9s based on their current grasp of indices and directed numbers.

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=20% D=50%
**The "Multipliers":** These students see the numbers 3 and 4 and immediately perform multiplication. Because the -3 is negative, their instinct is to stick a minus sign in front of the result. For those who choose B, they are simply ignoring the sign entirely. They aren't thinking about powers; they are thinking about operations.

basic: A=15% B=0% C=80% D=5%
**The "Rules-Followers":** This group understands that $3^4$ is 81. However, they have a "sticky" mental rule that "if the base is negative, the answer is negative." They haven't quite internalised the idea of pairs of negatives cancelling out over even exponents. They see the minus in the question and feel it *must* be preserved in the answer.

proficient: A=60% B=0% C=40% D=0%
**The "Fast Finishers":** These students know the math, but they are prone to the "calculator trap" (even without a calculator). They imagine typing $-3^4$ into a search engine or non-scientific calculator which would give -81 due to order of operations. Many will select C because they rush and don't pause to visualise the four negative signs cancelling out.

advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
**The "Precise":** These students will instinctively write out $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$ or recognize that an even exponent on a negative base always yields a positive result. They are the only ones who won't be baited by the visual "presence" of the negative sign.
