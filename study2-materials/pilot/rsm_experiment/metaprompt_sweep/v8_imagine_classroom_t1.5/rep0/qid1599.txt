In this Year 9 class, the common pitfalls won't be about the concept of division as a fraction, but rather about visual orientation and the "order of operations" trap that persists from Key Stage 3.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The "Upside Down" Mistake (D):** My students who struggle with spatial reasoning (like Chloe or Jack) often treat division like a generic grouping. They see the expression `(h+4)` as more "substantial" or heavier than the single letter `c`, so they instinctively put the larger-looking term on top of the fraction.
*   **The "Floating Constant" (C):** Students like Leo, who are over-reliant on reading left-to-right, will translate $c \div h$ first and then just "tack on" the $+4$ at the end. They mentally ignore the brackets because they haven't fully internalised that the vinculum (fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol.
*   **The "Loves to Simplify" (B):** A few students who overthink will try to "balance" the expression, thinking that if there is a $+4$ on the bottom, there must be a $+4$ on the top to make it look "properly algebraic."
