To give you the predicted breakdown for my Year 9s, I have to look at the "fraction-phobia" that sets in at this age. Even for my mid-set kids, as soon as they see a fraction on the right-hand side, their algebraic logic starts to compete with their shaky mental arithmetic.

Here is the predicted distribution based on how they typically process these operations:

below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=30% D=0%
**The "Logic":** These students (like Chloe and Jack) see "3" and "12" and their brain screams "4". They don't think about inverse operations; they see a relationship between the numbers. Most will choose **A** because it feels like a fraction answer, but a few will choose **C** because they simply divide 12 by 3 and ignore the numerator entirely.

basic: A=45% B=35% C=10% D=10%
**The "Logic":** This group (like Leo) knows they need to divide by 3. However, they will try to do $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$ and mistakenly multiply the *numerator* (thinking $3 \div 12$ is 4, then putting it over 1) or simply perform the calculation upside down. **B** starts to appear here for the students who remember that "dividing makes the denominator bigger," but **A** remains the "it looks right" trap.

proficient: A=10% B=80% C=0% D=10%
**The "Logic":** Most of these students (like Sam) will correctly identify the operation as $1/12 \div 3$ and remember that $\div 3$ is the same as $\times 1/3$. The few errors in **D** come from students who lose their focus and subtract 3 from 12 instead of multiplying, or a stray **A** from a "silly mistake" speed-run.

advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
**The "Logic":** Students like Maya will see this instantly. They don't see numbers; they see the structure of the equation. They’ll likely finish this in under five seconds and spend the rest of the time doodling in their margins.
