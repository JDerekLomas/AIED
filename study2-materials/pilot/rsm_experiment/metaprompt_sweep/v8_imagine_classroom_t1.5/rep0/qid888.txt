Here is my prediction for the Year 9 cohort (average set), based on 15 years in the classroom and knowing exactly how their brains handle negative integers and FOIL.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The Option D Trap:** This is the biggest pitfall. Students like Leo and Sarah will correctly do $(-5) + (-7) = -12$ for the middle term, but then their brains "stick" on the negative sign. When they get to the final multiplication, they see two negatives and their instinct says "the answer involves a minus," resulting in $-35$. 
*   **The Option A Trap:** Students like Jack, who are rushing, will perform $(-7) - (-5)$ or simply find the difference between 7 and 5 for the middle term, forgetting that we are *summing* the two negative values.
*   **The Option C Trap:** This is for my "rule-memoriser" students who know that "two minuses make a plus" but apply it indiscriminately to both the addition (middle term) and the multiplication (last term).

**Predicted Distribution:**

basic: A=10% B=50% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
