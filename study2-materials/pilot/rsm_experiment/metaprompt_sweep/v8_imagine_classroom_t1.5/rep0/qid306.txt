Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 class of 30, ranging from those struggling with numeracy to those eyeing an 8 or 9 at GCSE.

**The Logic of the Errors:**
*   **The "BIDMAS Trap" (D):** This is the most common error for proficient and basic students. They have "BIDMAS" drilled into their heads. They see the **A** (Addition) comes before **S** (Subtraction) in the acronym, so they insist on doing $5+6$ first in Problem P. They over-apply the rule, forgetting that addition and subtraction have equal priority.
*   **The "Left-to-Right" Intuition (A):** Lower-ability students often ignore BIDMAS entirely and treat maths like reading a sentence. They choose the first operation they see in both cases.
*   **The Misapplied Rule (C):** A rare hybrid error where the student tries to use the BIDMAS acronym for Problem P but then reverts to left-to-right for Problem Q, usually out of cognitive fatigue or confusion.

**Predicted Distribution:**

below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=0% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=0% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=45% C=0% D=50%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
