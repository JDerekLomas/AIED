To predict the outcome for my Year 9s, I have to consider the "Sign vs. Reciprocal" battle that happens in their heads. Even my strongest students sometimes rush and pick the "identity" lookalike, while my struggling students see a minus sign in the question and a minus sign in the result and assume they need *another* minus sign to "keep it going."

**Below Basic (6 students):** These students are overwhelmed by the fractions and the negative signs. They will see the $-1$ and think the star must be the same as the starting number to "cancel out," or they’ll pick B because it "looks" the most mathematically complex.
**Basic (8 students):** This group knows that $3/4$ and $4/3$ are linked to the number 1. However, they have a fragile grasp of sign rules. They see a negative result and assume the multiplier must also be negative.
**Proficient (10 students):** They understand reciprocals well. The danger here is the "autopilot" error. They know that to get 1, you flip the fraction. Many will forget that a negative times a negative makes a positive, incorrectly choosing B because they want the "negative version" of the reciprocal.
**Advanced (6 students):** They will pause, visualize the equation as $(-0.75) \times x = -1$, and realize the sign must be positive to maintain the negative product.
