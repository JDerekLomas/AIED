Here is the predicted distribution for your Year 9 class. 

Even though this is "just" the FOIL/Grid method's final step, the combination of directed numbers and the "mental trap" of switching operations makes this a high-error question for specific profiles of students.

**Predicted Distribution:**
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%

**The Analysis:**

*   **The "Additive" Thinkers (C and D):** This is where my "below basic" and some "basic" students (like **Tyler or Chloe**) will fall. Their brains see the numbers -1 and -4 and, because they are currently overwhelmed by the algebraic context, they revert to "combining" the numbers rather than multiplying. They see "minus 1" and "minus 4" and think "total minus 5." Those who have a faint memory that "two minuses make a plus" will pick **C (+5)**, while those who are just thinking about a number line will pick **D (-5)**.

*   **The "Sign-Blind" (B):** Students like **Jack** often understand the operation (multiplication) but suffer from "cognitive load" issues. He'll do $1 \times 4 = 4$, but because the term in the second bracket looks like "take away 4," he just keeps the minus sign without thinking about the interaction between the two terms. He’ll confidently select **-4** and move on to the next question in seconds.

*   **The "Rule-Followers" (A):** My "proficient" and "advanced" students (**Maya and Sam**) will see this as the "L" in FOIL or the bottom-right box of their grid. They have internalized the mantra "negative times a negative is a positive" so deeply that it's reflexive. However, I expect a few of my usually "proficient" students to still slip up and choose **B** because they are rushing to get to the "actual" algebra in the rest of the expansion.

*   **The Why:** In Year 9, the biggest hurdle isn't the multiplication (1x4); it's the switching costs. They are being asked to do algebra, but the mistake happens in the arithmetic. Many will fail this not because they can't multiply, but because their brain interprets the "arrows" as a command to combine the constants rather than perform the specific step of a binomial expansion.
