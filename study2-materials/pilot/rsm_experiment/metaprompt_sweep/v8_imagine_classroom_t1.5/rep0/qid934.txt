Here is the predicted distribution based on typical Year 9 classroom misconceptions.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The 5 (C) Trapping:** This is the most common error for your "basic" and "proficient" students. They see $x=0$, know they need to solve for $y$, and effectively ignore the $2y$. Their brain performs $10 - 0 = 10$, but then they either forget to divide by 2 or they simply look at the $x$ and $y$ and assume $y$ must be half of $10$ because they’ve seen so many $y = 2x$ graphs recently. Actually, the most common reason for picking 5 is simply seeing $4(0) + y = 10 \rightarrow y = 10$, then panicking and picking the most "mathsy" looking factor of 10.
*   **The 20 (A) Trapping:** This will come from your students who struggle with the concept of an equation. They see the 4 and the 10, they see a 2, and they assume multiplication is the only tool in the box: $2 \times 10 = 20$. 
*   **The 2.5 (D) Trapping:** These students are "over-thinkers" who divide 10 by 4 instead of by 2.

**Predicted Distribution:**

below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=5% D=0%
