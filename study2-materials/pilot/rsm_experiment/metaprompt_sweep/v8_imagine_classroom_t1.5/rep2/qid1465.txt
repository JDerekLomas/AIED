Here is the predicted distribution and analysis for my Year 9 class.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The Left-to-Right Trap (C and D):** Even in Year 9, several students (like Jack and Chloe) still treat maths like reading a sentence. They will calculate $(3 - 5)$, get $-2$, then add $4$ to get $2$, and finally multiply by $2$ to get **B (4)**. Or, if they panic at the negative number, they'll do $5-3=2$, then $2+4=6$, $6 \times 2=12$, and stick a minus sign on it because "it felt like a negative question," landing on **C (-12)**.
*   **The "Addition before Subtraction" Myth (A vs B):** This is the biggest hurdle. Students who have "BIDMAS" drilled into them often take the **A** (Addition) before **S** (Subtraction) literally. Leo and Sarah will calculate $5+4=9$ first. Then they face $3-9$. This leads them to $-6$, but since $-6$ isn't an option, they will flip it to **6 (A)** or conclude they made a sign error and pick **4 (B)** to be safe.
*   **Negative Number Fatigue:** For the middle-attaining students, the calculation is $3 - 5 + 8$. They know they must do $4 \times 2$ first. However, many struggle with $-5 + 8$. They see the $5$ and the $8$, and their brain defaults to $5+8=13$, then $3-13 = -10$ (**D**).

**Predicted Distribution:**

basic: A=35% B=40% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=95% C=0% D=0%
