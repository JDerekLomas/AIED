To give you the most accurate prediction, I’m looking at my seating plan. This is a classic "trap" question where the difficulty isn't the arithmetic, but the literacy (reading the final instruction) and the lingering bad habits from Year 7.

**The "D" Group (The Basic Tier):**
These students (like Chloe and Jack in the back row) still view fractions as four independent numbers rather than parts of a whole. They will see $7+1$ and $10+4$ and jump straight to Option D ($4 \frac{8}{14}$). In their minds, they are being efficient. They feel a brief sense of satisfaction that their answer is right there on the page.

**The "A" Group (The Proficient Tier):**
These are my "over-workers" (like Leo). They have been drilled to convert mixed numbers to improper fractions before calculating ($27/10 + 9/4$). They will correctly find the common denominator and get $99/20$. However, they will be so exhausted by the mental effort of the calculation that they will ignore the "Leave your answer as a mixed number" instruction. They'll see $99/20$ as Option A and click it immediately, feeling they've "proven" their maths.

**The "B" Group (The Advanced Tier):**
These students (like Maya) will either use the whole-number-first method or convert to $4 \frac{19}{20}$ at the final step. They are the only ones who will read the entire question prompt.

**The "C" Group:**
Very few will pick this, but a couple of students who struggle with common denominators will simply multiply $10 \times 4$ to get 40 and then guess at the numerator.
