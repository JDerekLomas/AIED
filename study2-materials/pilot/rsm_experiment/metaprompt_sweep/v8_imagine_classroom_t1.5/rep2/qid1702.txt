To predict the outcome for my Year 9s, I have to consider the typical "traps" of linear equations. 

The main hurdle here isn't the subtraction; it's the decimals and the manipulation of the constant. A significant number of students will mentally rearrange the equation incorrectly before substituting, or they will make a sign error when moving the -3 to the other side. 

**Option C (3.3)** is the "quick math" trap—students doing $30 + 3 = 33$ and then $33 \div 10$ because they struggle with the decimal balance. 
**Option D (2.7)** is the most common error for middle-attainers: they will subtract $6(0.5)$ from $30$ instead of adding it ($10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 27$), forgetting that to "undo" a minus, you must add.

Here is my predicted distribution based on my four ability groups:

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=50% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=5% C=25% D=50%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
