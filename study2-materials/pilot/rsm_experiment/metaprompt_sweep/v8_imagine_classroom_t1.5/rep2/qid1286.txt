Here is the predicted distribution for a typical mixed-ability Year 9 class.

**The Classroom Instinct:**
This isn't a test of "Do they know the sphere formula?"—it’s a test of "Can they rearrange a formula with fractions and indices?" Under the pressure of a timed quiz, Year 9s often stop at the first step that "looks" right or panic when they see the cube root symbol.

**Why they get it wrong:**
*   **The "Multiplying by the Top" Trap (Distractor A):** Students like **Josh** and **Chloe** know that a 3 and a 4 are involved. They see the $\frac{4}{3}$ in the formula and simply 'move' it to the other side without flipping it. They think they are multiplying by the whole fraction rather than dividing.
*   **The Pi Placement (Distractor B):** Students like **Leo** get the fraction inversion right (3 on top) but get confused about the $\pi$. Since $\pi$ is written next to the $r^3$ in the original formula, they mentally "detach" it and stick it in the denominator, but sometimes they misprocess the 4 and the 3 simultaneously.
*   **The "I hate cube roots" (Distractor D):** Students like **Sarah** will reach for this because it looks simpler. They understand $V$ needs a cube root, but they find the idea of a fraction *inside* a radical messy and assume the constants must sit outside.

**Predicted Results:**
