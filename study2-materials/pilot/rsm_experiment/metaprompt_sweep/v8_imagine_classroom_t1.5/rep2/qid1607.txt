To a Year 9 class, this is a classic "Change Side, Change Sign" trap. They see the equation and their brains go into autopilot.

Step 1 looks correct to almost everyone because the multiplication ($15 \times 4$) is straightforward. However, Step 2 is the "lure." Students see a $1$ and a $60$, and their intuition screams that they should be combined. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60, many will instinctively add them because they aren't thinking about inverse operations; they are thinking about "completing" the number sentence.

Here is how the distribution will likely break down:

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with fractions. They might guess D because they assume any multi-step algebra shown to them in a trick question must be wrong, or B because they can't verify Step 1.
*   **Basic:** This group is the most likely to choose **C**. They see $60$ and $1$ and think "61, yep, looks right." They move too fast to check if the $+1$ should have been subtracted.
*   **Proficient:** These students know the rules but are prone to "the illusion of fluency." About half will catch the error in Step 2, while the other half will fall for the trap because Step 1 was so obviously correct that they lowered their guard for Step 2.
*   **Advanced:** These students will mentally solve the equation as $k=59$ before even looking at Isaac’s steps. They will immediately spot the addition error in Step 2.

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=0% C=30% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
