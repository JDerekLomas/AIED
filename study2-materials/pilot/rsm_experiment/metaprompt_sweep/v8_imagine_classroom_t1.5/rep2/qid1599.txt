To give you some context on my Year 9s: we’ve been working on algebraic notation, but "the denominator as a single entity" still trips them up. My **below_basic** group often sees algebra as a puzzle where you just shuffle letters around, while my **basic** group knows the rules but gets "fraction-shy" and forgets that the division bar acts as a grouping symbol.

Here is how I expect my 30 students to split across the options:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
*Reasoning: These students (like Tyler and Leo) will pick **B** because they see the '+4' in the question and feel it needs to be "balanced" or repeated. Some will pick **C** because they translate left-to-right and don't realise the division bar must go under the entire expression.*

basic: A=60% B=10% C=15% D=15%
*Reasoning: This group (like Mia and Josh) understands the fraction bar means divide, but **D** is a classic "order doesn't matter" mistake. They'll also lean towards **C** if they are still thinking in terms of BODMAS where they want to "divide first" then "add 4".*

proficient: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
*Reasoning: Most of these students will get it right. The few errors will be "silly mistakes"—scanning too quickly and clicking **D** because they saw the $h$ and $c$ and didn't check which was the divisor.*

advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
*Reasoning: For my top-set students (like Sarah), this is a 5-second retrieval task. They see the brackets and automatically visualise the fraction bar.*
