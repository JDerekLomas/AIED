Here is my prediction based on my Year 9 class and the typical pitfalls they face with BIDMAS and decimals.

**Teacher's Notes:**
The biggest hurdle here isn't the squaring; it’s the order of operations and decimal place value. 
*   **A (0.81)** is the classic "I'll do $(3x)^2$" error. Students like Chloe and Jack will multiply $3 \times 0.3$ first to get $0.9$, then square it. It feels more "natural" to them to work left to right.
*   **C (1.8)** is the "multiplication by power" trap. Several of my mid-tier students still occasionally do $0.3 \times 2$ instead of $0.3^2$, leading to $3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$.
*   **D (2.7)** is the decimal point disaster. They do $3 \times 3^2$, get $27$, and then guess where the decimal goes, thinking "one decimal place in the question, one in the answer."

**Predicted Answer Distribution:**

below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=15% B=60% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
