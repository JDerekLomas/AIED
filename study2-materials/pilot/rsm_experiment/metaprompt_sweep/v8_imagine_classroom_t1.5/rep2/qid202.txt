Here is my prediction for our Year 9 class of 30. Even though this looks like a "easy" Primary-level question, I know exactly where the traps are for these kids.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The D-Trap:** My "Middle Set" (Basic/Proficient) students are notorious for "over-mathing" the denominators. They see an addition sign and their brain screams "add everything," leading them to $5+5=10$.
*   **The B-Trap:** My high-fliers (Advanced) often switch to autopilot. They instantly convert to improper fractions to solve ($\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}$) but will likely miss the "leave as a mixed number" instruction because they finished the calculation so fast they didn't re-read the prompt.
*   **The C-Trap:** My lower-ability (Below Basic) students often get overwhelmed by multiple rules. They'll add the numerators but then add the denominators too, while completely forgetting what to do with the whole numbers.

**Predicted Distribution:**

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=10% C=0% D=0%
