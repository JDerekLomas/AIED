**Teacher’s Insight and Predictions:**

**The Pitfall:** Most students know that a number multiplied by its reciprocal equals 1. However, the presence of the negative sign creates a cognitive "sign fatigue." 

**The "Below Basic" Group:** These students will fixate on the negative signs. They see a negative on the left and a negative on the right, and their intuition tells them they need "more negatives" to keep it negative, or they simply get confused and choose **C** because it’s the positive version of the fraction they see. They often forget the "negative times positive equals negative" rule under pressure.

**The "Basic" Group:** This is where the most frustration occurs. They will correctly identify that they need the reciprocal ($\frac{4}{3}$), but they will over-correct for the negative sign. A huge chunk of these students will pick **A** because they remember "negative times positive is negative." However, a significant minority will pick **B** because they think "the answer is negative, so the fraction must be negative," or they are blindly applying the "change the sign and flip it" rule (which applies to perpendicular gradients, not simple reciprocals).

**The "Proficient" Group:** Most will get **A** correct. The ones who miss it will likely do so because they are working too fast and see the negative on the result (-1) and assume the missing piece must also be negative (**B**) without actually calculating $(-)\times(-)=(+)$.

**The "Advanced" Group:** Almost all will get **A**. The 5% error margin accounts for a "silly mistake" where they overthink and accidentally provide the negative reciprocal as if they were solving for a perpendicular line in coordinate geometry, a topic we covered last fortnight.
