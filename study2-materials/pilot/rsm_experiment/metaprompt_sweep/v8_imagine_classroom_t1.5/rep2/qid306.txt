Here is the predicted distribution for a typical mixed-ability Year 9 class of 30 students.

**Teacher's Insight:**
The "trap" here isn't the multiplication (most students know BIDMAS/BODMAS by Year 9); it is the "A" in BIDMAS (Addition). My **Basic** and even some **Proficient** students have been conditioned to believe that because 'A' comes before 'S', they must always add before they subtract. In Problem P, they will see $5+6$ and do that first, leading them to Option D. My **Below Basic** students will simply work left-to-right for everything, leading them to Option A.

**The Predicted Distribution:**

below_basic: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=0% D=30%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

**Why they will get it wrong:**

*   **The "Left-to-Right" Group (mostly Below Basic/Lower Basic):** These students are intuitive thinkers who haven't internalised order of operations as a "law." They will pick **A** because their brain reads math like a sentence. They see $4+5$ first in Problem Q and don't even look for a multiplication sign.
*   **The "BODMAS Rigidists" (mostly Basic/Lower Proficient):** These are the students who will get it wrong for "smart" reasons. They will pick **D**. They remember the acronym and take it literally: "Addition comes before Subtraction." In Problem P, they see the $+$ sign and think they are being tested on their ability to follow the letters in order, so they choose to do $5+6$ first. They will be annoyed when I tell them Addition and Subtraction have equal priority.
*   **The "Advanced" Outlier:** One student in the top set will pick **D** because they are overthinking. They'll momentarily confuse themselves by trying to treat the subtraction as adding a negative, but then fall back on the literal alphabet of the acronym under the pressure of a quick-fire question.
