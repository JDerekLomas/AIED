Here is the predicted distribution for your Year 9 class, based on typical misconceptions regarding directed numbers and algebraic expansion operations.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The -4 and -5 (B & D):** These will be the most common errors for your middle and lower sets. Students like **Jack** or **Chloe** often see the signs and think "I'm working with negatives, so the answer must be negative." They forget the rule that a negative times a negative is a positive because they are focused on the "feeling" of the numbers.
*   **The +5 (C):** This is a classic "operation slip." Students like **Leo**, who often rush, will see the numbers 1 and 4 and their brain will switch to addition (-1 - 4 or 1 + 4) instead of multiplication. They know they are expanding brackets, but the "L" in FOIL (Lasts) often triggers an accidental sum in their heads.
*   **The -5 (D):** This is the "Double Jeopardy" error. These students have added the numbers (getting 5) AND applied the "it's negative" logic. 
*   **The +4 (A):** Your "Proficient" and "Advanced" students will find this easy, but you'll still lose a couple of "Proficient" students to **B** simply because they see the minus sign on the 4 and just carry it across without thinking.

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=10% D=0%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
