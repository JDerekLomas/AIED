Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9s.

**The Context:**
*   **LHS:** $8 + (12 \div 4) = 11$
*   **RHS:** $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 5$
*   **Correct Answer:** A ($11 > 5$)

**The Mindset:**
My "Below Basic" group will see the numbers 8, 12, and 4 on both sides and experience "Equality Blindness." They won't calculate; they will assume the brackets are just "flavour text" and pick C because the digits match. My "Basic" students often work strictly left-to-right regardless of BIDMAS; they'll get 5 on both sides ($(8+12) \div 4 = 5$ and $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$) and also pick C. Some might overthink the symbol and choose D just because it looks "more mathematical."

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=20% D=0%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
