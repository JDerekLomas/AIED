To give you my prediction, I have to look at this through the eyes of a 13-year-old. While we teach them "Inverse Operations" (the balance method) and "Multiplying everything by the denominator," these two methods often battle for dominance in a student's head, usually resulting in a "mix-and-match" error.

**Who will get it wrong and why?**

*   **The "Rule-Followers" (C):** A significant portion of my mid-range students will choose C. They have a "floating" rule in their head that says "If you move the 3, you multiply." They see Katie multiplied 12 by 3 to get 36, so they think it's legally allowed. They forget that you must multiply *every* term (including the -5) to maintain the equality. They’ll see Katie’s line as a shortcut, not a mistake.
*   **The "Panic-Clickers" (B):** These students often get overwhelmed by fractions. As soon as they see $x/3$, they want the fraction gone immediately. They will see Katie's answer, see that the fraction is gone, and assume she's the one with the "master trick."
*   **The "Tom-only" (A):** My strongest students will see Tom's method is the standard $+5$ to both sides. They will recognise Katie's error instantly because they’ve been bitten by the "forgetting to multiply the constant" mistake in Year 8.
