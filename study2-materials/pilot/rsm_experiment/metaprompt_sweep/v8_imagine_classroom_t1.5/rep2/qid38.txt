To predict the outcome for my Year 9s, I have to account for "The Adding Fever." Even my bright students often switch off their brains when they see a plus sign between fractions and revert to the "add the tops, add the bottoms" rule they learned (and were told to forget) in Year 7.

Here is the predicted distribution based on how they tackle the algebraic denominators:

**A (The Correct Answer):** Requires finding the common denominator ($2x$). 
**B (The "Add Across" Trap): $3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$.** This is the most common misconception for struggling students.
**D (The Numerator-only adjustment):** Some will recognise the denominator needs to be $2x$, but will forget to multiply the 4 by 2, resulting in $\frac{3+4}{2x}$.

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%

**Student Analysis:**

*   **The "Below Basic" Group (e.g., Tyler and Chloe):** They see a plus sign and move horizontally. To them, $2x + x = 3x$. They aren't thinking about equivalent fractions or common denominators; they are just trying to "simplify" the string of symbols as quickly as possible. Option B is their magnetic North.
*   **The "Basic" Group (e.g., Leo and Sarah):** They know they shouldn't just add the bottoms. They'll remember $2x$ is the common denominator, but they lack the "fractional balance" instinct. They will change the $x$ to $2x$ but leave the $4$ as it is. They'll confidently select D, feeling proud that they didn't fall for the $3x$ trap.
*   **The "Proficient" Group (e.g., Amira):** Most will get A. However, a few will have a "brain-fart" and try to cross-multiply unnecessarily, getting $\frac{3x + 8x}{2x^2} = \frac{11x}{2x^2}$ and then potentially failing to cancel the $x$ correctly, leading them to second-guess and pick C or a different distracter.
*   **The "Advanced" Group (e.g., James):** This is a 10-second mental arithmetic task for them. The only reason they'd get it wrong is a genuine "copying error" or sheer overconfidence.
