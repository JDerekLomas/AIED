To give you the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 class, I am categorising the students by their current mathematical attainment levels.

In this specific question, the primary "trap" isn't the algebra—it's the visual manipulation of fractions. Students often see a "3" and a "12" and instinctively hunt for a "4".

Here is how I expect the 30 students to perform:

**below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=30% D=0%**
These students (approx. 5 students) will see the numbers $3$ and $12$ and immediately think of the relationship $12 \div 3 = 4$. Because the $12$ is on the bottom, they will reflexively pick **A** ($\frac{1}{4}$) because it "looks right" to have the $4$ stay in the denominator. Those who pick **C** are simply ignoring the fraction bar entirely.

**basic: A=45% B=35% C=10% D=10%**
These students (approx. 10 students) understand they need to divide by $3$, but they struggle with the mechanics of dividing a fraction by an integer. Many will perform "12 divided by 3" in their heads instead of "1/12 divided by 3," leading them back to **A**. Those who choose **B** have correctly remembered to multiply the denominator (or "Keep-Change-Flip"), while a few will choose **D** by accidentally subtracting 3 from 12 or confusing it with a square root relationship.

**proficient: A=15% B=80% C=0% D=5%**
These students (approx. 10 students) know the rule: to solve $3p$, you divide the other side by $3$. They will successfully calculate $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$. The 15% who get it wrong (Choice **A**) are the "rushed" workers who are so confident in their mental arithmetic that they will write down $p = 1/4$ before their brain actually processes the division of the fraction.

**advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%**
These students (approx. 5 students) will see this as a one-step operation. They will likely mentally check their answer by substituting $1/36$ back into the equation ($3 \times 1/36 = 3/36 = 1/12$) and will not fall for the distractor A.

**Final Predicted Distribution:**

below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=30% D=0%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=80% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
