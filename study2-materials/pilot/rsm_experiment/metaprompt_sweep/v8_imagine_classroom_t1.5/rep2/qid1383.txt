Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9s. I’m picturing the middle-set group; they are often confident enough to work quickly but prone to the "negative power" traps and linear multiplication slips.

**The Logic behind the errors:**
*   **Students getting B and D:** These are the "autopilot" students. They see a 3 and a 4 and instinctively multiply them. In their heads, $3 \times 4 = 12$. They aren't thinking about powers at all; they are just clearing the task.
*   **Students getting C:** These are my conscientious "rules" students who remember that $3^4 = 81$, but they haven't internalised the "even power makes it positive" rule. They see the minus sign in the question and assume it must "stick" to the final answer. They likely typed `-3^4` into a non-scientific calculator or just did `3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 81` then tacked the negative on at the end.
*   **Students getting A:** My high-fliers and those who have been caught by the "negative squared" trick before. They know $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$ results in a positive.
