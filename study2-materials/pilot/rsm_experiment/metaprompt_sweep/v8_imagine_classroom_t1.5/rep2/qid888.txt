Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30 students.

**Teacher's Instinct Notes:**
*   **The Sign Trap:** This question is less about the algebra and more about the negative numbers. Even though they know "FOIL" or the grid method, the calculation $-5 \times -7$ is a notorious hurdle.
*   **The "Proficient" Mistake:** My mid-range students often remember that $-5 - 7 = -12$, but then their brains short-circuit when doing the final multiplication, thinking "I've already used the minus signs" and finishing with $-35$ (Option D).
*   **The "Basic" Mistake:** These students will see $-5$ and $-7$ and simply find the difference between 5 and 7 to get $2m$ (Option A). They often ignore the rules for adding two negatives.
