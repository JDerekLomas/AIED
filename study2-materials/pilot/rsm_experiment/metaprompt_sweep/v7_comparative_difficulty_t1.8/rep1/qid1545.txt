As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It’s a classic "trap" question that tests Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) rather than computational skill.

In a Year 9 context, the left side of the expression is the "danger zone." Many students still process calculations left-to-right instinctively, especially under pressure.

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**

While the numbers are simple, the **misconception activation** is extremely high. This isn't a question where students guess; it's a question where they confidently perform the wrong calculation.

**The Maths:**
*   **Left side:** $8 + 12 \div 4$. Proper BIDMAS (Division first): $8 + 3 = \mathbf{11}$. 
*   **Left side (The Trap):** $8 + 12 = 20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.
*   **Right side:** $(8 + 12) \div 4$. Brackets first: $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.
*   **Result:** $11 > 5$. Correct Answer: **A**.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

#### **Below Basic (Working towards Year 7 standards)**
These students almost always work left-to-right. They will calculate the left side as $20 \div 4 = 5$ and the right side as $20 \div 4 = 5$. They will see two identical sets of numbers and operations and reflexively choose "Equal."
*   **A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%**

#### **Basic (Year 8/9 mid-set, inconsistent BIDMAS)**
These students have heard of BIDMAS but apply it inconsistently. Some will spot the brackets on the right but forget the division rule on the left. The "symmetry" of the numbers $8, 12, 4$ is a heavy cognitive lure toward option C.
*   **A=25% B=10% C=60% D=5%**

#### **Proficient (GCSE Grade 4-5 target)**
These students generally know to divide before adding. However, a significant minority will be "tricked" by the visual similarity of the two sides and second-guess their own logic, wondering if there is a hidden rule they've forgotten. 
*   **A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%**

#### **Advanced (GCSE Grade 7-9 target / Top Set)**
These students will immediately identify this as a "trick" question designed to test order of operations. They will show their working (11 vs 5) and move on quickly.
*   **A=95% B=0% C=4% D=1%**

### **Teacher’s Insight:**
The high percentage for **C** in the lower tiers isn't just a lack of knowledge; it’s a **visual bias**. Students see $(8+12) \div 4$ and $8+12 \div 4$ and their brains "simplify" the left side to match the right side to create harmony. This is the primary hurdle in teaching algebra later on!
