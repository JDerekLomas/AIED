As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen hundreds of students tackle the FOIL (First, Outside, Inside, Last) method for expanding brackets. This specific question targets the "Last" terms: $(-1) \times (-4)$.

This is a high-misconception question. It doesn't test the complexity of the algebraic expansion itself, but rather the fundamental rules of directed numbers (integers) within an algebraic context.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
While the operation is simple multiplication, for a typical Year 9 student, the presence of brackets and algebra adds a "cognitive load" that leads to frequent sign errors. It is a 4 because while most know they need to multiply, the "double negative" rule is a notorious stumbling block under pressure.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working at Year 7 level / KS2):**
These students often confuse multiplication with addition or subtraction. They see "-1" and "-4" and instinctively combine them to get -5.
*   **A=15% B=15% C=10% D=60%**

**Basic (Working at Year 8 level):**
These students know that "expanding" involve multiplication, but they haven't internalised the "negative times a negative" rule. They often think a negative always "wins."
*   **A=25% B=55% C=10% D=10%**

**Proficient (Secure Year 9 / Foundation GCSE):**
These students are familiar with the FOIL method and know the sign rules. However, some will still make a "slips" error, picking B because they see the minus signs in the brackets and don't pause to process the double negative.
*   **A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%**

**Advanced (Working at Greater Depth / Higher GCSE):**
These students have high procedural fluency. They will recognise this as the "Last" term and instantly identify the product as positive 4.
*   **A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%**

### Teacher's Analysis of Options:
*   **A (+4):** The correct answer.
*   **B (-4):** The most common "confidently wrong" answer. Students multiply $1 \times 4$ but assume the negative carries over.
*   **D (-5):** The second most common error. Students see the terms and perform $-1 - 4$ instead of multiplying, confusing the "Inside/Last" multiplication step with "collecting like terms."
*   **C (+5):** Rare; usually a result of someone who thinks "the negatives cancel" but performs addition ($1 + 4$) instead of multiplication.
