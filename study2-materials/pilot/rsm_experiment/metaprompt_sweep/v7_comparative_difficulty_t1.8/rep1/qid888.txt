This is a classic "bread and butter" GCSE-style question that specifically tests a student's ability to manipulate directed numbers (negatives) while applying the FOIL or Grid method.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
For a Year 9 class, this is mid-range difficulty. While the process of expanding double brackets is taught in Year 8/9, the "double negative" constant term and the "sum of two negatives" linear term are notorious for triggering high-confidence misconceptions. This isn't a "random guess" question; students usually think they have the right answer even when they are wrong.

### PREDICTED DISTRIBUTIONS

**Below Basic**
*Likely to forget the middle terms entirely or struggle with negative operations.*
* **A=40%** (Calculates $-7 + 5$ or simply misses the $(-7) + (-5)$ logic)
* **B=20%** (Correct, but often a lucky guess at this level)
* **C=15%** (Sees two minuses and assumes they both become pluses)
* **D=25%** (Correct middle term, but thinks $(-5) \times (-7)$ stays negative)

**Basic**
*Comfortable with FOIL/Grid, but still highly prone to the "negative times negative equals negative" error.*
* **A=15%** (Arithmetic slip on the linear term)
* **B=45%** (Slight majority get it right through systematic method)
* **C=10%** (Sign confusion)
* **D=30%** (High misconception: Correctly adds $-5-7 = -12$, but incorrectly multiplies to $-35$)

**Proficient**
*Understands the mechanics and has internalised the rules for directed numbers.*
* **A=5%** (Careless error)
* **B=85%** (Standard success rate for this cohort)
* **C=2%** (Rare)
* **D=8%** (Occasional slip on the final sign)

**Advanced**
*Should be working toward fluency where these become automatic.*
* **A=1%**
* **B=98%**
* **C=0%**
* **D=1%**

### Teacher's Note: The "Red Flag"
Option **D** is the strongest distractor. Students often work from left to right:
1. $m \times m = m^2$ (Check)
2. $-5m - 7m = -12m$ (Check)
3. $-5 \times -7 \dots$ "Uh, 35, and there's a minus there, so minus 35."
They often get the "hard" part (the linear term) right and then fail on the "easy" part (Year 7 negative multiplication).
