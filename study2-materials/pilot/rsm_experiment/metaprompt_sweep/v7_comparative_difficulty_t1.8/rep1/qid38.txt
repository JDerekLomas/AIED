As a UK maths teacher, I would classify this as a **high-misconception question**. 

While Year 9s (ages 13–14) are taught algebraic fractions, many struggle because they try to apply "standard" addition rules (add the tops, add the bottoms) without reconciling the denominators. The inclusion of the variable $x$ often makes students forget basic numerical fraction arithmetic.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this is harder than adding basic numerical fractions but easier than solving quadratics. The difficulty lies in the "variable denominator" trap.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to options:**
*   **A ($11/2x$): Correct.** Student found the common denominator ($2x$), converted $4/x$ to $8/2x$, and added the numerators.
*   **B ($7/3x$): The "Add Everything" Trap.** Student added $3+4$ and $2x+x$. Very common for those who don't understand denominators.
*   **C ($11/x$): The "Forgot the 2" Trap.** Student multiplied the 4 by 2 but dropped the $2x$ denominator for a single $x$.
*   **D ($7/2x$): The "Lazy Addition" Trap.** Student saw $2x$ was the likely denominator but just added the numerators without converting the second fraction.

| Group | A (Correct) | B (Misconception) | C (Calculation Error) | D (Conceptual Error) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | **60%** | 15% | 15% |
| **Basic** | 35% | **40%** | 10% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | **75%** | 10% | 5% | 10% |
| **Advanced** | **95%** | 2% | 1% | 2% |

### Teacher’s Commentary:
*   **Below Basic / Foundation:** These students almost universally choose **B**. They treat the fraction bar as a separator rather than an operator. To them, the "top" and "bottom" are two separate addition sums.
*   **Basic:** This group knows they need a common denominator but often fails to perform the balanced operation on the numerator. They often flip-flop between **B** and **D**.
*   **Proficient:** These students recognize that $4/x$ is equivalent to $8/2x$. They might make a "silly" error, but they are generally secure in the process.
*   **High Confidence/High Error:** This is a "confident wrong" question for lower-ability students. They will circle **B** instantly and feel they have mastered the topic.
