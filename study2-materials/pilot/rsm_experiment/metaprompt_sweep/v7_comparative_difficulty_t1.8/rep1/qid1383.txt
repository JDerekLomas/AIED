As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it perfectly illustrates the gap between "knowing the method" and "handling the notation." While the calculation itself is simple, it is a "minefield" question for Year 9.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this sits at a **6**. While the arithmetic is primary-school level ($3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$), the interaction between **powers** and **negative integers** is one of the highest misconception areas in the Key Stage 3 curriculum. It is a "high-confidence, high-error" question.

### Pedagogical Insight:
*   **The "Sign" Trap:** Many students believe that "if the base is negative, the answer must be negative." 
*   **The "Calculator" Trap:** Students who use a calculator but type $-3^4$ instead of $(-3)^4$ will be told the answer is $-81$ by the device, reinforcing the error.
*   **The "Linear" Trap:** Weaker students see a $k$ and a $4$ and instinctively multiply them (the "3 times 4" error).

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic**
*Likely haven't mastered indices or the rules of negative multiplication.*
**A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%**
*   **Why:** These students often default to linear operations. B and D are highly attractive because $3 \times 4 = 12$. The choice between positive and negative is often a coin flip.

**Basic**
*Understand that $k^4$ means $k \times k \times k \times k$, but struggle with negative signs.*
**A=30% B=10% C=55% D=5%**
*   **Why:** This group knows $3^4 = 81$. However, they usually succumb to the misconception that "A negative in means a negative out." Option C is the "confident wrong" answer here.

**Proficient**
*Solid understanding of indices; beginning to internalise the "even power = positive result" rule.*
**A=75% B=2% C=20% D=3%**
*   **Why:** Most will correctly pair the negatives $(- \times - = +)$ to get 81. However, even proficient students make "slip" errors under time pressure, often picking C because it "looks" more like a negative substitution answer.

**Advanced**
*Total mastery of substitution and the laws of arithmetic.*
**A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%**
*   **Why:** Advanced students have likely been "bitten" by this trap before (or by their calculators) and are hyper-aware of the importance of brackets when substituting negatives. They will recognise the even power immediately.
