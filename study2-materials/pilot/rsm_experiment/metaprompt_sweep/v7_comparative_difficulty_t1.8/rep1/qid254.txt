As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it doesn't test the **process** of addition; it tests the **conceptual understanding** of the number zero and the **mathematical grammar** of order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
While the numbers are small, this is a "high-trap" question. For a Year 9 student, it sits at a 6 because it intentionally triggers two of the most common misconceptions in secondary mathematics: the "zero doesn't count" fallacy and the "calculator input" syntax error.

### The Misconception Profiles:
*   **The "Zero is Nothing" Trap:** Students often believe 0 doesn't affect the mean, leading them to divide by 4 (Option C).
*   **The BIDMAS Trap:** Students who use scientific calculators poorly often type the string exactly as written in Option B, not realising the calculator only divides the 7 by 5.
*   **The Correct Logic:** Option A is correct because $0+1+3+4+7$ is equivalent to $1+3+4+7$, but the divisor must remain 5.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working towards GSCE Grade 1-2):**
These students likely struggle with the definition of the mean and are highly susceptible to the visual "common sense" of ignoring the zero.
*   **A=15% | B=20% | C=55% | D=10%**
*   *Primary error:* Choosing C because there are four "actual" numbers.

**Basic (Working at GCSE Grade 3-4):**
These students know you sum the numbers and divide by the count, but they are often tripped up by notation.
*   **A=40% | B=30% | C=25% | D=5%**
*   *Primary error:* Many will pick B because it "looks" like the instruction they would type into a calculator, or C if they are still unsure about the zero.

**Proficient (Working at GCSE Grade 5-6):**
Most students here recognize that the 0 must be counted in the divisor (eliminating C). However, a significant minority will still fall for the lack of brackets in Option B.
*   **A=70% | B=20% | C=5% | D=5%**
*   *Primary error:* B (Order of operations oversight).

**Advanced (Working at GCSE Grade 7+):**
These students have a high level of "mathematical fluency." They will instantly spot that $1+3+4+7$ is the same as $0+1+3+4+7$ and identify the fractional notation as the only one that correctly groups the numerator.
*   **A=95% | B=2% | C=1% | D=2%**
*   *Primary error:* Very few errors, likely only through extreme overthinking (wondering if D is a trick).

**Summary for the Teacher:** 
This is a "Low Floor, High Ceiling" diagnostic question. It is excellent for a starter activity to spark a debate about whether zero is a "placeholder" or a "value."
