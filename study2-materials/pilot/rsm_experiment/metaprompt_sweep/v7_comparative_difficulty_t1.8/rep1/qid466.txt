This is a classic "trapped by the negative" question. For a Year 9 student, it targets three distinct areas: knowledge of reciprocals, the "minus times a minus is a plus" rule, and the conceptual understanding of 1 as a multiplicative identity.

The high frequency of errors usually stems from students seeing the negative in the original fraction and automatically selecting a positive answer because they know they need "two minuses to make a plus," but failing to track that the result is -1, not 1.

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**
(It is lower than a Year 9 completing the square, but higher than simple fraction arithmetic because of the negative sign trap and the inverse nature of the question.)

### **Teacher Insight & Analysis**

*   **Option A (The Confident Error):** This will be the most common "incorrect" answer for the middle-to-lower ability tiers. Students recognize the reciprocal rule ($3/4$ turns into $4/3$ to make $1$) but they remember a "negative rule" and assume the negative signs cancel out, forgetting that they need the final product to stay negative.
*   **Option B (The Correct Answer):** Requires the student to realize that to keep a result negative, one must multiply a negative by a *positive*. Therefore, only the fraction flips, not the sign. 
*   **Option C (The Identity Error):** These students are simply trying to "balance" the fraction aesthetically. They see $3/4$, they pick $3/4$, thinking they need the "same thing" to reach $1$.
*   **Option D (The Distractor):** Only selected by those with very weak understanding of fraction multiplication, essentially guessing or confusing this with addition (where $-3/4 + (-1/4) = -1$).

**The Misconception Factor:**
This is a high "misconception activation" question. **Proficient** students will often trip up if they are rushing (leading them to A), whereas **Advanced** students will check their work by substituting back in and realize $(\text{neg}) \times (\text{pos}) = (\text{neg})$.
