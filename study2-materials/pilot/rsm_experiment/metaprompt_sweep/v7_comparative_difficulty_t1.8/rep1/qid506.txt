As a UK maths teacher, I find this specific question fascinating because it perfectly targets a "low floor, high ceiling" misconception regarding inverse operations and fractions.

For a Year 9 student (age 13-14), the algebraic structure is simple, but the arithmetic is "sticky."

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the algebra is "Level 3/4," the presence of the fraction $1/12$ moves this from a routine one-step equation to a conceptual trap. Most Year 9s can solve $3p = 12$ instantly, but once the fraction is introduced, many abandon their algebraic rules and rely on "intuitive" number sense, which fails them here.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Students working at KS2 levels or lower Tier 3/4):**
These students often look for the simplest relationship between the numbers 3 and 12.
*   **A=45%** (They see 3 and 12 and perform $12 \div 3 = 4$, keeping the fraction).
*   **B=10%** (Likely a lucky guess).
*   **C=40%** (They simply perform $12 \div 3 = 4$ and ignore the fraction entirely).
*   **D=5%** (Mistakenly thinking of $3^2$ or similar).

**Basic (Standard Tier/Core students):**
This group is the "danger zone" for confident misconceptions. They know they need to divide by 3, but they struggle with how to divide a fraction by an integer.
*   **A=60%** (The "Confidence Trap": $1 \div 12 \div 3$ is visually processed as $(1) / (12 \div 3)$).
*   **B=25%** (Those who remember "multiply the denominator" or use a calculator).
*   **C=10%** (Realising they are wrong halfway through and defaulting to 4).
*   **D=5%** (Confusion with $3 \times 3$).

**Proficient (Upper Band/Higher Tier foundation):**
These students have mastered the process but may still make a "slip."
*   **A=15%** (Speed error).
*   **B=75%** (Systematic application of $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$).
*   **C=5%** (Outlier error).
*   **D=5%** (Misreading 12 as 27 or another number).

**Advanced (Top Set/Targeting Grade 8-9):**
These students see the trap immediately and likely double-check their work.
*   **A=2%** (Rare careless error).
*   **B=96%** (Secure understanding of reciprocals).
*   **C=1%** (N/A).
*   **D=1%** (N/A).

### Teacher's Analysis of the Distractors:
*   **Option A ($1/4$) is the "Great Distractor."** Students instinctively want to do $12 \div 3$. In their minds, "making things smaller" means dividing the bottom of the fraction.
*   **Option C ($4$)** is for students who suffer from "Fraction Phobia"—they simply extract the integers and perform the easiest operation possible to reach a whole number.
*   **Option B ($1/36$)** is the correct answer but feels "too small" to students with weak proportional reasoning. They find it counter-intuitive that dividing by 3 results in a larger denominator.
