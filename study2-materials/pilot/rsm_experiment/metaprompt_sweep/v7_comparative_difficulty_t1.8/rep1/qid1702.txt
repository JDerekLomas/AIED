As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this as a classic "low-floor, high-ceiling" problem that specifically tests a student's ability to manipulate linear equations and handle basic arithmetic with decimals.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this is slightly above middle difficulty. While the concept (substitution) is taught in Year 7 and 8, the specific "messiness" of this question raises the barrier. In a standard UK foundation GCSE paper, this would be a middle-of-the-pack marks winner.

**Why it’s a 6:**
1.  **Inverse logic:** Students are used to finding $y$ when given $x$. This requires working backward to find $x$.
2.  **Implicit calculation:** $6 \times 0.5$ is often miscalculated as $0.3$ or $12$ (multiplying by $0.5$ vs dividing by $0.5$).
3.  **Two-step rearrangement:** Once $3$ is subtracted/added, they must divide by $10$, which introduces a decimal shift.
4.  **High Misconception Activation:** Students will "confidently get it wrong" because they will likely make a sign error or an arithmetic error and find that their wrong answer is conveniently listed as a distractor.

### PREDICTED RESPONSE DISTRIBUTIONS

**The Calculation:**
*   $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \implies 10x - 3 = 30$
*   $10x = 33 \implies x = 3.3$ (Correct Answer: **C**)

**The Distractors:**
*   **A (4.25):** Miscalculates $6 \times 0.5$ as $12$. $10x - 12 = 30 \implies 10x = 42.5 \implies x = 4.25$.
*   **B (-4.25):** Similar to above but with a major sign/subtraction error.
*   **D (2.7):** Correct multiplication ($3$) but subtracts it from $30$ instead of adding it ($10x + 3 = 30$).

#### **below_basic (Working towards Grade 1-2)**
*These students struggle with the order of operations and the concept of "substitution." Many will guess based on "what looks right" or try to subtract $0.5$ from the coefficients.*
**A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%**

#### **basic (Working towards Grade 3-4)**
*These students know to plug $0.5$ into the $y$, but they will struggle with the negative sign. They often do $30 - 3$ rather than $30 + 3$ when moving the constant to the other side.*
**A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%**

#### **proficient (Working towards Grade 5-6)**
*These students are comfortable with two-step equations. The main hurdle here is the decimal arithmetic. They are the group most likely to select the correct answer but might get caught by Distractor D if rushing.*
**A=5% B=5% C=75% D=15%**

#### **advanced (Working towards Grade 7-9)**
*These students will identify the trap (multiplying by 0.5 and the sign change) almost instantly.*
**A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%**
