As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this as a classic "distractor" question that targets **procedural order of operations** in algebra.

The crux of the question lies in Katie’s method. To get $x-5=36$, she has multiplied by 3 but failed to distribute that multiplication across the entire side (the $-5$ should have become $-15$). This is a very common "confident" mistake for Year 9 students who understand the inverse of division is multiplication but forget the rules of balancing equations.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 student, solving $\frac{x}{3}-5=12$ is about a 4/10. However, evaluating *someone else’s* non-standard steps (like Katie’s) adds cognitive load and exploits misconceptions. This elevates the difficulty to a 6/10 because it forces them to check "legitimacy" rather than just "result."

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to responses:**
*   **Correct Answer:** **A** (Only Tom)
*   **Common Misconception:** **C** (Both) – Students often believe they can "choose" which part of the expression to multiply first without applying it to all terms.

| Student Level | A (Only Tom) | B (Only Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 20% | 40% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 35% | 15% | 45% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 65% | 5% | 25% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 92% | 1% | 5% | 2% |

### Teacher’s Analysis:

*   **Below Basic:** These students often guess. Some will choose **C** because "there is usually more than one way to do it," or **B** because they think you must get rid of the fraction first as a golden rule.
*   **Basic:** This is the high "Misconception Activation" zone. They recognize Tom is correct (adding 5), but they will strongly fall for Katie’s trap. They see "$\times 3$" and "$\times 3$" on both sides and assume it’s legal, forgetting that $3(\frac{x}{3} - 5)$ must be $x - 15$. Expect **C** to be the most popular answer here.
*   **Proficient:** These students have usually been bitten by this mistake in their own work and have been corrected. They will recognize that Katie didn't multiply the 5, leading them to **A**.
*   **Advanced:** These students will likely mentally solve the equation ($x=51$) and then "plug" it into Katie's line to see if it holds true ($51-5=46$, not $36$), identifying her error almost immediately.
