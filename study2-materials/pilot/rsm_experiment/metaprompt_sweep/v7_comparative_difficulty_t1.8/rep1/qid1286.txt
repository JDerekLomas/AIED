This is a classic "subject-manipulation" question that tests two distinct skills: recall/recognition of a 3D formula and the algebraic proficiency to rearrange it.

For a Year 9 student (ages 13–14), this is a significant hurdle. While they are introduced to volume formulas, they often struggle when the "answer" ($V$) is provided and they must work backward to find a component ($r$), especially when cubing and $\pi$ are involved.

### **DIFFICULTY: 8/10**

**Why this rating?**
*   **Formula Recall:** Students must first remember $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.
*   **Fractional Manipulation:** Moving the $4/3$ involves multiplying by $3$ and dividing by $4$. Many students will mistakenly try to divide by $3$ or multiply the whole thing by $4$.
*   **The Cube Root:** Distinguishing between a square root and a cube root is a common "confident error."
*   **The Distractors:** The distractors are high-quality. Option A looks "correct" to a student who knows the components but doesn't understand the inverse operations. Option B is a common result of "losing" the 3 or the 4 during the swap.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Key for Categories:**
*   **Below Basic:** Struggling with arithmetic, likely to guess or choose based on "looking familiar."
*   **Basic:** Knows the formula but fails the algebraic steps.
*   **Proficient:** Comfortable with the formula and one-step equations, but may trip up on the $4/3$ fraction.
*   **Advanced:** Fully comfortable with rearranging complex subjects.

| Category | A | B | C (Correct) | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 40% | 20% | 15% | 25% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 25% | 10% | 20% |
| **Proficient** | 25% | 20% | 45% | 10% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | 5% | 85% | 5% |

### **Teacher’s Analysis of the Distractors:**

*   **Choice A:** This is the "Confident Incorrect" leader for Basic/Proficient students. They see $4$, $\pi$, and $3$ and assume they all stay in the same relative positions (multiplied together) before the root is applied.
*   **Choice B:** Common if a student successfully divides by $\pi$ but flips the fraction $3/4$ the wrong way (or tries to divide $V$ by the existing $4/3$ incorrectly).
*   **Choice D:** This appeals to students who remember the numbers but think the cube root only applies to the $V$ and not the constants, a very common error in higher-tier GCSE algebra.
*   **Choice C (Correct):** To get here, the student must perform: $3V = 4\pi r^3$, then $\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$, then cube root. Each step is a "filter" that removes students with fragile algebraic understanding.
