As a UK maths teacher, I see this as a standard "fluency" question that tests two distinct things: the arithmetic of adding fractions and the ability to follow a specific formatting instruction ("Leave your answer as a mixed number").

For a Year 9 student, adding fractions with **common denominators** is technically a Primary School skill (KS2). However, mixed numbers still trip up a significant portion of the cohort because of misconceptions regarding the denominators.

### DIFFICULTY: 3/10
While the numbers are "easy," the inclusion of distractors targeting common misconceptions makes it a bit more challenging than a simple calculation.

### Prediction Rationale:
*   **The Trap (Option D):** This is the "high misconception activation" point. Students often believe that *everything* in a fraction must be added, including the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$).
*   **The Instruction (Option B):** This is the correct numerical value but the wrong format. "Proficient" students who rush often convert to improper fractions to solve but forget to convert back, failing to read the final instruction.
*   **The Random Error (Option C):** Usually chosen by students who have no grasp of adding whole numbers and simply add all digits they see.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working toward Year 7 standards)**
*They struggle with the concept of a denominator being a "label" rather than a number to be added.*
A=30% | B=10% | C=20% | D=40%

**Basic (Working at Year 7/8 standards)**
*They can add the whole numbers but are highly likely to fall for the 'add the denominators' trap.*
A=50% | B=10% | C=5% | D=35%

**Proficient (Meeting Year 9 expectations)**
*They understand the common denominator remains the same, but about 1 in 5 will ignore the 'mixed number' instruction.*
A=75% | B=15% | C=0% | D=10%

**Advanced (Targeting Grade 7-9 GCSE)**
*Total mastery; unlikely to make a slip unless through extreme carelessness.*
A=96% | B=3% | C=0% | D=1%
