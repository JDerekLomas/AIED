As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it targets a specific "weak point" in the Year 9 curriculum: moving from explicit equations ($y = mx + c$) to implicit ones ($ax + by = c$).

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**

While the arithmetic is simple ($10 \div 2$), the conceptual load is high for Year 9. Most students are trained to see a table and "plug in" $x$ to get $y$ immediately. This question requires a multi-step algebraic process: substituting $x=0$, simplifying to $2y=10$, and then solving for $y$.

### **Predicting Response Distributions**

**Key Misconception Activation:**
*   **The "First Number" Trap:** Many students see $4x$, see $x=0$, and ignore that term, but then focus on the $10$ or the $4$.
*   **The Operation Reversal:** Students often see $4x + 2y = 10$ and mistakenly perform $10 \div 4$ (leading to D) because they associate the $x$ coefficient with the primary division step.
*   **Random Association:** Students might add $2$ and $3$ to get $5$ simply because they are the numbers visible in the equation.

#### **below_basic (Working towards Grade 2-3)**
*Students in this group struggle with formal substitution. They often look for "magic" relationships between the visible numbers.*
**A=10% B=15% C=45% D=30%**
*Reasoning: $C$ is a very "attractive" distractor here because $10/2$ is simple, but many will guess $D$ ($10/4$) because they start with the first coefficient they see.*

#### **basic (Working towards Grade 4)**
*Students have some grasp of substitution but are highly prone to procedural errors or "formulaic thinking."*
**A=5% B=30% C=40% D=25%**
*Reasoning: This group will be split. Many will correctly solve $2y=10$, but a significant portion will fall for $B$ (guessing $y$ values must be smaller/pattern-based) or $D$ (incorrectly dividing by $x$'s coefficient).*

#### **proficient (Working towards Grade 5-6)**
*Students are comfortable with $y = mx + c$ and simple linear equations.*
**A=2% B=15% C=75% D=8%**
*Reasoning: Most will correctly substitute $x=0$ and solve. The errors here will be "confident mistakes"—students who rush and assume $x$ is 1 or perform the wrong inverse operation.*

#### **advanced (Working towards Grade 7+)**
*Students recognize the equation of a line in implicit form and can manipulate it mentally.*
**A=0% B=2% C=97% D=1%**
*Reasoning: For an advanced Year 9 student, $4(0) + 2y = 10$ is a trivial one-step equation. Errors will be rare "slip-of-the-pen" mistakes.*

**Summary of the "Star" Choice:**
Option **C** is the correct answer. The "High Misconception" trap here isn't necessarily that they get it wrong confidently (like a BIDMAS trap), but rather that they apply the correct logic to the **wrong coefficient** (choosing D).
