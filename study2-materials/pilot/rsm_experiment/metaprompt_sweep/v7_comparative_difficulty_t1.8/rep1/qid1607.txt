This is a classic "trap" question that specifically targets a very common procedural misconception in algebra: inverse operations and equality.

In Step 1, the student correctly multiplies by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). 
In Step 2, however, the student sees $60 = 1 + k$ and instinctively thinks "60 plus 1 equals 61," rather than subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$. This is a "high misconception activation" question. Students feel very confident that $60+1=61$ and often rush through Step 2 without checking the balance of the equation.

### **DIFFICULTY: 4/10**
(For a Year 9 class, the arithmetic is simple, but the cognitive load of identifying another person's error—especially one that mimics a common internal error—raises the difficulty from a 2 to a 4.)

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Below Basic** (Working significantly below age-related expectations):
These students struggle with the initial multiplication and the concept of "doing the same to both sides." They may pick D because the equation looks "too big" or guess randomly.
*   **A=20% | B=15% | C=40% | D=25%**

**Basic** (Targeting Grade 2/3 at GCSE):
This is the danger zone for this question. These students will likely recognise that $15 \times 4 = 60$ is correct (Step 1). However, their grasp of Step 2 is purely phonetic/visual; they see "60", "1", and "+" and immediately think "61". They will confidently choose C.
*   **A=30% | B=5% | C=60% | D=5%**

**Proficient** (Targeting Grade 4/5 at GCSE):
These students are more likely to slow down. They will verify Step 1 and then "do the math" for Step 2. If they are rushing, they may fall for C, but most will spot that $60 - 1$ should be $59$. 
*   **A=65% | B=5% | C=25% | D=5%**

**Advanced** (Targeting Grade 6+ at GCSE):
These students should see the error instantly. They are familiar with "check your answer" techniques and will mentally plug 61 back into the original equation ($62 \div 4 \neq 15$).
*   **A=90% | B=2% | C=5% | D=3%**

**Summary of the "Confidence Trap":**
This question is a "Confidently Wrong" magnet. Option **C** will be a highly popular "distractor" for Year 9s because it rewards the initial success of Step 1 while failing to challenge the mental shorthand used in Step 2.
