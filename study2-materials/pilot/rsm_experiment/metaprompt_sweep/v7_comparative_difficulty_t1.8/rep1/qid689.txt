As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It appears simple, but it targets a fundamental misunderstanding of algebraic structure and "direction" of division.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10

While the arithmetic is Year 2 level, the algebraic manipulation (where the unknown is the denominator) is a classic "stumbling block" in Key Stage 3. This is a high **misconception-activation** question. Students don't guess randomly; they confidently perform the wrong operation.

### Analysis of Errors:
*   **The "Multiplying" Error (B):** Students see 10 and 5 and assume they must multiply them to "get rid" of the fraction. This is the most common error for students who lack a conceptual grasp of inverse operations.
*   **The "Commutative Division" Error (C):** Students see 10 and 5 and instinctively divide the larger number by the smaller one ($10 \div 5 = 2$). This is the most "confident" wrong answer.
*   **The "Correct" Logic (A):** To solve this, students must realise $10p = 5$, therefore $p = 5/10$. This requires a higher level of fluency.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working below age-related expectations)**
*These students are "number crunchers." They see 10 and 5 and choose an operation that feels "right." Multiplication is the default "algebra action" for many.*
**A=10% B=45% C=40% D=5%**

**Basic (Working at age-related expectations)**
*These students recognize division is involved but treat it as commutative. They will almost all perform $10 \div 5$ rather than $5 \div 10$ because it results in a "nicer" whole number.*
**A=25% B=15% C=55% D=5%**

**Proficient (Secure in Year 9 curriculum)**
*These students understand that $p$ being on the bottom changes the workflow. They might still hesitate, but they are likely to check their answer: "Does $5 \div 0.5$ equal 10?"*
**A=70% B=5% C=23% D=2%**

**Advanced (Targeting Grade 7-9 at GCSE)**
*These students see the structure immediately. They may even mentally swap the $p$ and the 10 using the property of proportions.*
**A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%**

### Teacher's Verdict:
This is a "trick" question not because of the numbers, but because it baits the student into doing $10 \div 5$. If you put this in a Year 9 mid-term exam, **Option C** is your "distractor of the day." Many students will walk out of the room thinking they got it right.
