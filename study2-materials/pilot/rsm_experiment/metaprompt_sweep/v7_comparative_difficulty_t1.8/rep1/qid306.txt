This is a classic "trapped" question that specifically targets one of the most persistent misconceptions in Key Stage 3 mathematics: the literal interpretation of the order of operations acronyms like BIDMAS/BODMAS.

### Difficulty Rating: 4/10
While the arithmetic itself is Year 1/2 level, the conceptual logic required to navigate the **"Addition/Subtraction tie-break"** makes this moderately difficult for Year 9. Many students "confidently get it wrong" because they follow the letters B-I-D-M-A-S alphabetically, assuming Addition *must* come before Subtraction.

### The Misconception (The "A before S" Trap)
Most students will correctly identify that in Problem Q, the multiplication ($5 \times 6$) must happen first. The point of failure is Problem P. Because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, a significant number of students believe $5+6$ must be done first, even though addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic** (Working toward GSCE Grade 1-2)
*These students often lack a systematic approach to order of operations and tend to work strictly left-to-right across all problems.*
*   **A=60%** (Left-to-right for both)
*   **B=20%**
*   **C=10%**
*   **D=10%**

**Basic** (Working toward GCSE Grade 3-4)
*These students have "learned" BIDMAS but interpret it as a rigid hierarchy. They know multiplication is high priority, but fall into the Addition-over-Subtraction trap.*
*   **A=15%**
*   **B=25%**
*   **C=5%**
*   **D=55%** (The "BODMAS Trapped" choice)

**Proficient** (Working toward GCSE Grade 5-6)
*These students are beginning to understand that MD and AS are "equal priority pairs," but may still hesitate or second-guess when the question asks "What *should* you do" rather than just finding the answer.*
*   **A=5%**
*   **B=65%** (The correct logic)
*   **C=0%**
*   **D=30%**

**Advanced** (Working toward GCSE Grade 7-9)
*These students understand the nuance of left-to-right processing and recognize that adding first in Problem P would actually result in the wrong answer (calculating $4-11$ instead of $-1+6$).*
*   **A=2%**
*   **B=95%**
*   **C=0%**
*   **D=3%**

### Final Distribution Summary (Typical Year 9 Class Mixed Ability)
| Option | Reasoning | Predicted % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | Pure left-to-right (ignores BIDMAS entirely) | 15% |
| **B (Correct)** | **Identifies equal priority for P; identifies priority for Q** | **45%** |
| C | Reverse order logic (very rare) | 2% |
| D | Rigid BIDMAS hierarchy (The "A before S" error) | 38% |

**Teacher's Note:** Option D is the most "dangerous" distractor. If you use this in class, you will find students who are usually "good at maths" arguing passionately for D because "The rule says Addition comes before Subtraction." This is the "Confident Error" you referred to.
