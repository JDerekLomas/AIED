As an experienced UK maths teacher, I would categorize this as a **conceptual/notation** question rather than a calculation-based one. For a Year 9 student, this tests the transition from "Primary/KS3 Level 1" notation (using the $\div$ symbol) to "GCSE-ready" notation (using the vinculum as a grouping symbol).

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
While the concept is fundamental, this question acts as a "trap" for students with weak understanding of BIDMAS/Order of Operations in an algebraic context. It isn’t "hard" to perform, but it is very easy to "misread" if a student doesn't respect the brackets.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key Insights:**
*   **A** is the correct answer.
*   **C** is the "High Misconception" trap. Students who ignore the brackets or don't understand that the fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol will pick this.
*   **D** is the "Inversion" error, common among students who know it's a fraction but forget which term is the divisor.

| Student Level | A (Correct) | B (Distractor) | C (Misconception) | D (Inversion) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 25% | 15% | 40% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 55% | 5% | 25% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 2% | 8% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 0% | 1% | 1% |

### Teacher’s Commentary:

*   **Below Basic:** At this level, many Year 9s still treat algebra as a "pantomime" of symbols. They will see $c \div h$ and $+4$ separately. **C** is highly attractive because it matches the visual order of the horizontal string ($c$ then $h$ then $4$).
*   **Basic:** These students have been taught that "divide means a fraction bar." They are likely to narrow it down to **A** or **D**. The most common error here is the "upside-down fraction," where they forget that the first number in a division goes on top.
*   **Proficient:** These students understand that the brackets force $h+4$ to stay together. They recognize the vinculum (fraction bar) effectively replaces the brackets. They will solve this quickly and confidently.
*   **Advanced:** This is a "1-second question" for them. They would only get it wrong through extreme haste or misreading the letters.

**Misconception Activation:** This is a high-activation question for the "LNR" (Left-to-Right) misconception. Students who read maths like a sentence will almost always gravitate towards **C** because it preserves the linear sequence of the original expression.
