This is a classic "trap" question that tests two distinct functional skills: **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)** and **Directed Number (Negative Integers)**.

In my experience with Year 9 (ages 13-14), the multiplication ($4 \times 2 = 8$) is rarely the issue. The real battleground is the "Addition/Subtraction" phase. Students often incorrectly believe that because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, they must add before they subtract, leading them to calculate $5 + 8$ first.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
While the arithmetic is simple, the misconception density is high. It ranks lower than a quadratic because it requires fewer steps, but it ranks higher than a simple calculation because it actively baits the student into a wrong path.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic**
*These students often work strictly left-to-right, ignoring BIDMAS entirely, or make significant sign errors.*
*   **Calculation:** $3 - 5 = -2$; $-2 + 4 = 2$; $2 \times 2 = 4$.
*   **A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%**

**Basic**
*These students know BIDMAS exists but misunderstand the "Addition/Subtraction" rule. They think Addition must happen before Subtraction regardless of position.*
*   **Calculation:** $4 \times 2 = 8$, then they do $5 + 8 = 13$, then $3 - 13 = -10$.
*   **A=15% B=15% C=10% D=60%**

**Proficient**
*These students understand BIDMAS but might slip up on the negative number calculation. They know to do $4 \times 2$ first, but struggle with $3 - 5 + 8$.*
*   **Calculation:** $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 8 = 6$. Many will arrive at the correct answer, but a significant minority will still fall for the "Addition first" trap (D).
*   **A=65% B=5% C=5% D=25%**

**Advanced**
*These students recognize that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and are worked left-to-right, or they treat the expression as $3 + (-5) + 8$.*
*   **Calculation:** $4 \times 2 = 8$; $3 - 5 = -2$; $-2 + 8 = 6$.
*   **A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%**

### Teacher's Note: The "Confidently Wrong" Factor
This question has high **misconception activation**. Option **D (-10)** is the "Distractor King." Students who pick D will feel very confident because they "remembered the rule" (BIDMAS), not realizing they applied the final step of the rule incorrectly. They won't guess; they will solve it and be certain they are correct.
