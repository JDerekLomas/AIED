This is a classic "trap" question for a Year 9 group. While the calculation itself is standard upper Key Stage 2 / lower Key Stage 3 material, the specific distractor D taps into a massive, persistent misconception regarding fractions.

### **DIFFICULTY: 4/10**

**Justification:**
On a purely technical level, the mathematics isn't high-level (finding a common denominator of 20). However, it scores a 4 because the "Year 9 Dip" often sees students reverting to intuitive but incorrect shortcuts. Many students "confidently get it wrong" by treating the numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**A = The "Improper Fraction" Result:** Student calculated correctly but ignored the instruction to leave it as a mixed number.
**B = The Correct Answer:** $2 \frac{14}{20} + 2 \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$.
**C = The "Common Denominator Error":** Student multiplied denominators (10x4=40) but failed to adjust numerators properly, or got lost in the conversion.
**D = The "Death Star" Misconception:** Simply adding the big numbers ($2+2=4$), adding the tops ($7+1=8$), and adding the bottoms ($10+4=14$). This is the most common error in UK secondary schools for this topic.

| Category | A | B (Correct) | C | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 15% | 15% | **60%** |
| **Basic** | 15% | **45%** | 10% | 30% |
| **Proficient** | 20% | **70%** | 5% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | **95%** | 0% | 0% |

### **Teacher’s Insight:**

*   **Below Basic:** These students almost exclusively choose **D**. To them, adding fractions "across the top and bottom" feels intuitively correct because that is how multiplication works. They lack the conceptual understanding of the denominator as the "size" of the piece.
*   **Basic:** This group knows they need a common denominator but often makes a "slip" in the arithmetic or forgets to convert back to a mixed number. They are the most likely to fall for **A** or **C**.
*   **Proficient:** These students have mastered the algorithm (Common Denominator -> Add -> Simplify). If they get it wrong, it is usually a rushed calculation error.
*   **Advanced:** For an advanced Year 9 student, this is a 10-second mental arithmetic task. The only risk is if they fail to read the "Mixed Number" instruction and choose A, but at this level, their exam technique usually prevents that.
