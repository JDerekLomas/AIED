This is a classic "bread and butter" GCSE topic, but for a typical Year 9 student, it sits right at the junction of procedural fluency and sign-rule confusion.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10

While expanding brackets is a standard Year 9 skill, the presence of two negative signs elevates this from a Difficulty 2 (all positives) or Difficulty 3 (one negative) to a Difficulty 4. It specifically tests **negative number arithmetic** rather than algebraic structure. This is a "confident mistake" question; students who have mastered FOIL/Grid method often slip on the constant term (-5 × -7).

### PREDICTED RESPONSE DISTRIBUTIONS

I have categorised the "Year 9 types" based on their likely cognitive pitfalls:

*   **A (The Simplifier):** Subtracts 5 from 7 to get -2, and treats -5 × -7 as -35.
*   **B (The Correct):** Correctly identifies $-5 + -7 = -12$ and $-5 \times -7 = +35$.
*   **C (The Sign-Swapper):** Correctly gets 12 and 35 but assumes a "double negative" makes everything positive.
*   **D (The Constant Error):** Most common error. Gets the -12 correct but calculates $-5 \times -7 = -35$.

#### below_basic (Lower Sets / Working Towards)
*Students here often remember "multiply the numbers" but struggle with the concept of -5 - 7 or the rule for multiplying two negatives.*
**A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%**

#### basic (Middle Sets / Expected Level)
*Students know they need to add the middle and multiply the end, but the -5 × -7 = +35 is a very high-frequency "slip" area.*
**A=10% B=45% C=10% D=35%**

#### proficient (Upper Middle Sets)
*These students have drilled the FOIL or Grid method. Most will catch the double negative on the +35, but a few will rush the addition.*
**A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%**

#### advanced (Top Set / G&T)
*Fluency is high here. The only errors are "silly" slips under time pressure.*
**A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%**

### Teacher's Insight:
The "Distractor D" is the strongest foil here. In a classroom, if you ask this as a "mini-whiteboard" starter, about 30% of the class will usually write D because they process the -5 and -7 as a subtraction problem for the first term but forget the sign-rule for the multiplication of the final term. C is a common "logic guess" for students who think "two negatives always make a positive" applies to the entire expression.
