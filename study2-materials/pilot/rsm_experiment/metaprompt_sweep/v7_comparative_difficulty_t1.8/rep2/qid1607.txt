This is a classic "trap" question that specifically targets a high-frequency misconception in algebraic manipulation: the inverse operation of subtraction.

In Step 1, the student correctly multiplies by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). In Step 2, however, they see the $+1$ and, instead of subtracting 1 to isolate $k$, they "move it over" and add it to the 60, resulting in 61. This is a very common error where students know *something* changes, but they fail to apply the inverse.

**DIFFICULTY: 4/10**
(It is mechanically simple, but the "confident error" in Step 2 makes it tricky for a Year 9 student who is rushing or relies on rote memorisation.)

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic:** Students at this level often struggle with the initial fraction. They may think Step 1 is wrong because they don't know how to "get rid" of the 4. They are likely to guess D or choose B because 61 "looks" like a plausible answer.
**Basic:** This group usually understands Step 1 but falls directly into the trap of Step 2. They see $1+k$ and think "plus means add," leading them to $60+1$. This is the "high misconception activation" group.
**Proficient:** These students will recognise that Step 1 is correct. Most will spot the error in Step 2, though a small percentage will skim-read and choose C by mistake.
**Advanced:** These students will mentally solve $15 = (1+k)/4$ to get $k=59$ and immediately identify that only Step 1 holds up.

| Group | A (Correct) | B (Only 2) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 25% | 25% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 30% | 10% | **55%** | 5% |
| **Proficient** | **75%** | 5% | 15% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | **95%** | 1% | 2% | 2% |

**Teacher's Note:** The danger here is that "Step 1" feels like the hard part (dealing with the fraction), so once a student agrees with Step 1, they "relax" and accept Step 2 without verifying the inverse operation. This is why **Option C** will be the most common distractor for the middle-ability cohorts.
