As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this as a classic "low ceiling, high trap" question. For a Year 9 student (13-14 years old), this assesses **algebraic notation**—specifically the transition from primary-school operation signs to fractional representation.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10

While the concept is fundamental, this question is a high-activation misconception trap. It doesn't test calculation skill, but rather the understanding of the **vinculum** (the fraction bar) as a grouping symbol. Students who rush often fall for C, and those with a poor understanding of "numerator vs. denominator" fall for D.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working toward Year 7 targets)**
*These students are likely to be overwhelmed by the letters. They often look for familiar "patterns" or symbols. Many will see the "+4" at the end of the original expression and pick C because the +4 "looks" the same.*
*   **A=30% | B=15% | C=45% | D=10%**

**Basic (Working at Year 7-8 level)**
*These students know division becomes a fraction. However, they frequently struggle with the "order" of division. They might also mistakenly try to "balance" the expression by adding +4 to the top (Choice B).*
*   **A=55% | B=10% | C=15% | D=20%**

**Proficient (Meeting Year 9 expectations)**
*Students here understand that the expression following the division sign is the divisor and must go in the denominator. They recognize the implicit brackets created by the fraction bar.*
*   **A=85% | B=2% | C=5% | D=8%**

**Advanced (Working toward Grade 7-9 at GCSE)**
*At this level, the algebraic convention is second nature. Any errors here would be "finger slips" or extreme rushing rather than lack of knowledge.*
*   **A=98% | B=0% | C=1% | D=1%**

### Teacher’s Analysis:
*   **The Trap (Option C):** This is the "Visual Continuity" error. Students who don't understand that the division sign applies to the *entire* bracket will pick C. In their head, they see "c divided by h" then "plus 4".
*   **The Swap (Option D):** This is the "Directional" error. Because we read left-to-right but often write fractions "top-to-bottom," weaker students frequently invert the numerator and denominator, thinking the larger or more complex expression belongs on the bottom or vice-versa.
*   **The Invention (Option B):** A classic over-complication where the student thinks "If there's a 4 on the bottom, I should probably have one on the top to keep it even."
