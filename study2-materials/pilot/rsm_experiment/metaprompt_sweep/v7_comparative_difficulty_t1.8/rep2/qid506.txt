As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It appears deceptively simple, but it targets a specific "blind spot" in fractional arithmetic and algebraic manipulation that persists even into GCSE.

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 student, this is a **high-misconception** question. While the operations required are foundational, the spatial arrangement of the numbers triggers a common cognitive shortcut (multiplying $3 \times 4 = 12$) rather than following the algebraic process ($ \div 3$). 

Students aren't just "unsure"; they are often **confident in their error**, making it a "distractor-heavy" problem.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to Distractors:**
*   **A ($p = 1/4$):** The "Visual Intuition" trap. Students see $3$ and $12$ and their brain performs $12 \div 3$. They keep the fraction format because the original had one.
*   **B (Correct):** The student understands that dividing by $3$ is the same as multiplying the denominator by $3$.
*   **C ($p = 4$):** Similar to A, but the student ignores the fraction entirely, or solves as if it were $12 \div 3$.
*   **D ($p = 1/9$):** A rare "cross-multiplication" error or miscalculation (squaring the $3$).

| Category | A ($1/4$) | B ($1/36$) | C ($4$) | D ($1/9$) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 45% | 15% | 35% | 5% |
| **Basic** | 55% | 30% | 10% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 25% | 70% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | 94% | 0% | 1% |

### Teacher’s Analysis:

1.  **Below Basic (Working at Year 7 level):** These students often disregard the structure of the equation. They see "3" and "12" and perform a operation that feels "right," usually division. Option C is very popular here because they often treat fractions as whole numbers if they are confused.
2.  **Basic (Typical "Mid-set" Year 9):** This group is the most likely to choose **A**. They know they need to "move the 3," but their mental shortcut for $12 \div 3$ overrides the actual rule of dividing a fraction ($1/12 \div 3$). They will confidently select $1/4$ and move on, feeling they've performed a successful operation.
3.  **Proficient (GCSE Grade 4/5 target):** These students are wary of "the trap." They are more likely to write down the intermediate step: $p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$. Once the step is written, they almost always reach $1/36$. 
4.  **Advanced (GCSE Grade 7-9 target):** These students see this as a difficulty 2/10. They instinctively treat "divide by 3" as "triple the denominator" and solve it in under 5 seconds.
