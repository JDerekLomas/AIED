As an experienced UK maths teacher, I would place this question firmly in the "mid-range" of Year 9 algebraic fractions. It tests two distinct skills: understanding equivalent fractions (finding a common denominator) and algebraic manipulation.

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**

For a typical Year 9 class, this isn't "easy" because it’s not just adding numbers. However, compared to a GCSE higher-tier "completing the square" problem, it is accessible. The primary challenge is the "confidently wrong" factor—students often apply "add the tops, add the bottoms" (the most common misconception in fraction arithmetic).

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Misconception Analysis:**
*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** The "Intuitive Error." Students add $3+4$ and $2x+x$. This is the "high misconception activation" distractor.
*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** The "Numerator Error." Students find the common denominator ($2x$) but forget to multiply the numerator of the second fraction, simply adding $3+4$ over the $2x$.
*   **Option A ($\frac{11}{2x}$):** The **Correct Answer**. Correctly converting $\frac{4}{x}$ to $\frac{8}{2x}$ and adding the numerators.

#### **Below Basic (Bottom 25%)**
*These students struggle with basic fraction rules and are intimidated by $x$. They will almost certainly choose the path of least resistance.*
*   **A=15% | B=60% | C=5% | D=20%**
*   *Majority choose B because it feels "logical" to add across.*

#### **Basic (Lower Middle 25%)**
*These students know you need a common denominator, but their execution is shaky. Many will recognise $2x$ as the base but fail the equivalent fraction step.*
*   **A=35% | B=30% | C=5% | D=30%**
*   *Split between the correct method (A), the intuitive error (B), and forgetting to scale the numerator (D).*

#### **Proficient (Upper Middle 25%)**
*These students are comfortable with algebraic notation and usually remember the "common denominator" rule for fractions. Most will reach the correct answer, but some will make a "silly" slip under pressure.*
*   **A=75% | B=5% | C=2% | D=18%**
*   *Most get it right; D remains the "trap" for those who work too quickly.*

#### **Advanced (Top 25%)**
*These students see the structure of the problem immediately. For them, this is a 20-second task.*
*   **A=96% | B=1% | C=1% | D=2%**
*   *Near-total mastery; errors are almost exclusively clerical/reading mistakes.*
