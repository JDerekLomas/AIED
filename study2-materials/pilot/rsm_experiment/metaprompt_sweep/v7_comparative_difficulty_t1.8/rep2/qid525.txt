This is a classic "trap" question for a Year 9 group. While the arithmetic isn't complex, the requirement to manage mixed numbers, common denominators, and final formatting provides multiple "exit ramps" for students to fall into misconceptions.

### **DIFFICULTY: 5/10**

For a Year 9 student, this is mid-tier. It isn’t "hard" in the sense of abstract problem-solving, but it is high-stakes for precision. It specifically tests whether they have moved past primary-school "shortcut" errors.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Key for Options:**
*   **A: The "Right Answer, Wrong Format" Trap.** They converted to improper fractions correctly ($\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54+45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$), but ignored the "Mixed Number" instruction.
*   **B: The Correct Answer.** ($4 + \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$).
*   **C: The "Common Denominator via Multiplication" Error.** They kept the correct numerator but multiplied the denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$), showing a fundamental lack of understanding of equivalent fractions.
*   **D: The "Add Across" Misconception.** (The "Classic Error"). Adding the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and then adding the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$). This is the most confident incorrect answer.

| Category | A (Improper) | B (Correct) | C (Mult Denom) | D (Add Across) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 15% | 15% | **60%** |
| **Basic** | 20% | **45%** | 5% | 30% |
| **Proficient** | **35%** | **60%** | 0% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | **95%** | 0% | 0% |

### **Teacher’s Insight:**

1.  **Below Basic:** These students will look at the question and go for the path of least resistance. **Option D** is extremely seductive because "adding across" feels intuitive. They will likely feel quite confident in this wrong answer.
2.  **Basic:** This group usually knows they need a common denominator but often forgets to scale the numerators or loses their way when regrouping the whole numbers.
3.  **Proficient:** These students know exactly how to do the math, but they are often "autopilot" learners. Many will convert everything to improper fractions to be safe, get $\frac{99}{20}$, and circle **A** immediately because they see their calculated number on the page, forgetting to convert back to a mixed number as requested.
4.  **Advanced:** These students will either treat it as $4 + 0.7 + 0.25 = 4.95$, then convert to $4 \frac{19}{20}$, or handle the fractions mentally. Only a "silly error" would stop them getting B.
