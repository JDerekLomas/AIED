As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this as a "surface-level easy" question that carries significant traps for Year 9 students (ages 13–14) who rely on rote memorisation rather than conceptual understanding of fractions.

### DIFFICULTY: 3/10
In the context of the GCSE curriculum, this is a "low-stakes" fluency question. However, for a typical mixed-ability Year 9 class, it ranks at a **3**. It is much easier than completing the square because it doesn't require finding common denominators; however, the presence of mixed numbers often triggers specific mechanical errors.

### Predicted Response Distributions

| Student Level | A (Correct) | B (Misread) | C (Process Error) | D (The "Double" Error) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 30% | 10% | 20% | 40% |
| **Basic** | 60% | 15% | 5% | 20% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 10% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 2% | 0% | 0% |

### Teacher's Analysis of the Distractors:

*   **A (The Correct Answer):** This is straightforward ($2+1=3$ and $\frac{1}{5}+\frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$). Most students will feel confident here.
*   **B (The "Equivalent" Trap):** This is the correct numerical value ($\frac{18}{5}$) but ignores the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number." Proficient and Advanced students often lose marks here by "over-solving" or converting to improper fractions out of habit for GCSE prep.
*   **C (The "Add Everything" Error):** A classic misconception seen in **Below Basic** students where they add both the numerators and the denominators ($1+2=3, 5+5=10$), while also forgetting or incorrectly processing the whole numbers ($11/5 + 7/5 = 18/10$).
*   **D (The Denominator Addict):** This is the highest "misconception activation" choice. Students correctly add the whole numbers ($3$) and correctly add the numerators ($3$), but instinctively add the denominators ($5+5=10$). In a Year 9 class, even "Basic" level students often fall for the urge to "do something" to the bottom number.

**Verdict:** This is a high-confidence, high-error question for lower-attaining students. They won't guess randomly; they will pick **D** and be certain they are correct. For advanced students, the only risk is **B** due to skipping the final line of instructions.
