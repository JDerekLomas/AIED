This is a classic "subject-rearrangement" task embedded within a geometry context. For a Year 9 student, this is significantly more challenging than it looks because it requires three distinct steps: recalling the formula (if not provided), identifying the operations to "undo," and managing the radical symbol.

### DIFFICULTY: 8/10
While "solving a quadratic by completing the square" is technically more complex algebraically, for a Year 9 student, rearranging formulas involving cubes and fractions often induces a higher level of "cognitive overload." This is a "confident mistake" type of question rather than a random guess question.

### ANALYSIS OF STUDENT LOGIC

**The "High Misconception" Factors:**
1.  **Recalling/Interpreting the Formula:** The formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ is the hurdle. Students often misremember it as $\frac{3}{4}$ or confuse it with the surface area formula ($4\pi r^2$).
2.  **Fractional Arithmetic (Option A):** This is the most common "confident" error. Many students see the $\frac{4}{3}$ in the formula and multiply the $V$ by $\frac{4}{3}$ instead of dividing by it (which is multiplying by $\frac{3}{4}$). Option A looks "right" to a student who knows the components of the formula but doesn't understand inverse operations.
3.  **The "Lego" Approach (Option B):** Students often try to move parts one by one. They move the $\pi$ first (dividing) and the $4/3$ next, but fail to flip the fraction correctly, leading to B.
4.  **Formatting Panic (Option D):** Weak students often see the $\sqrt[3]{V}$ and assume the rest of the numbers stay "outside" the radical, failing to realise that the entire expression must be under the cube root.

**Key Year 9 Performance Insight:**
*   **Below Basic** students will gravitate toward **A** or **D**. They recognize the symbols from the formula and pick the one that "looks" most like the volume formula.
*   **Basic** students struggle with the reciprocal. They know they need to divide by $4/3$, but they calculate $V \div \frac{4}{3}$ incorrectly as $\frac{4V}{3}$, leading them to **B**.
*   **Proficient** students can perform the rearrangement $3V = 4\pi r^3 \rightarrow \frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$ and correctly identify **C**.
