As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it perfectly illustrates the gap between "knowing the method" and "navigating the misconception."

For a Year 9 student (age 13-14), the calculation itself ($3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$) is manageable, but the presence of the negative base with an even exponent is a classic "trap." Many students rely on a shallow rule—*"If there's a minus in the question, there's a minus in the answer"*—without understanding the mechanics of pairs of negatives cancelling out.

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**

While it looks simpler than completing the square, it has a high **misconception activation** rate. In a high-stakes setting, students often "confidently get it wrong."

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Key to Distractors:**
*   **A (81):** Correct application of index laws and negative multiplication.
*   **B (12):** Confusion between powers and multiplication ($k \times 4$).
*   **C (-81):** Most common error—fails to recognize $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$ results in a positive. Often reinforced by incorrect calculator use (typing $-3^4$ instead of $(-3)^4$).
*   **D (-12):** Double error—multiplied instead of powers AND kept the negative.

| Category | A (81) | B (12) | C (-81) | D (-12) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 35% | 20% | 35% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 15% | 50% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 65% | 5% | 25% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 95% | 0% | 5% | 0% |

### **Teacher’s Insight:**
*   **The "Basic" Tier Trap:** This is the most dangerous group for this question. These students know $3^4 = 81$, but they have been conditioned by "negative numbers" drills where $(-a) + (-b)$ or $-a \times b$ often result in a negative. They see the negative sign and "stick it on" to be safe. They will choose **C** with 100% confidence.
*   **The "Below Basic" Multiplier:** Many students still struggle to distinguish $k^4$ from $4k$ under exam pressure. Option **D** is very attractive to them because it feels like a "complete" use of all numbers provided.
*   **The "Proficient" Calculator Slip:** Even proficient students often get this wrong if they have a scientific calculator in hand; typing $-3^x$ results in $-81$ due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), where the power is applied before the negation. Only the most robust students remember to use brackets.
