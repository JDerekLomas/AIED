As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it tests **procedural conceptualisation** rather than just the ability to "do" the sum. While the calculation itself is simple, it is a "minefield" of common misconceptions regarding the role of zero and the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

### **Difficulty: 4/10**
In the context of Year 9, this isn't mathematically complex, but it is high in "misconception activation." Students often stop thinking as soon as they see a pattern that looks familiar.

### **The Pedagogical Logic**
*   **The Zero Trap:** Weak students often believe zero "doesn't count." They may ignore it in the sum (which is fine) but then incorrectly reduce the denominator to 4 (Option C).
*   **The BIDMAS Trap:** Option B is a classic trap. Students read it left-to-right. In reality, $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$ equals $8+1.4 = 9.4$ because the division happens first. Many students ignore this and assume it represents the whole process.
*   **The "Trick" Question Bias:** High achievers may choose D because they see that while A is mathematically correct, it "omits" the 0 in the numerator, leading them to overthink whether it is a "complete" representation.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

| Category | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 40% | 45% | 5% |
| **Basic** | 35% | 25% | 35% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 70% | 10% | 15% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 85% | 2% | 3% | 10% |

#### **Analysis of Categories:**

*   **Below Basic (Working at Year 5/6 level):** These students will overwhelmingly pick **C** (because they think zero shouldn't be counted) or **B** (because it looks like the sequence of buttons they would press on a non-scientific calculator).
*   **Basic (Targeting Grade 2/3):** These students know the rule "sum divided by count." They are torn between **A** (which equals 3) and **C** (the most common error). Many will fall for **B** because they don't yet associate the horizontal fraction bar in **A** with necessary brackets.
*   **Proficient (Targeting Grade 4/5):** These students recognise that $1+3+4+7$ is the same as $0+1+3+4+7$ and that the count must be 5. They correctly identify **A**.
*   **Advanced (Targeting Grade 6+):** They will likely get **A** instantly. However, a small percentage may choose **D** because they are so conditioned to look for "tricks" that they argue Option A is technically an "incomplete" expression of the data set, even though it is mathematically valid.
