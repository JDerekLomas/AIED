As an experienced UK maths teacher, I encounter this specific "point of failure" frequently when teaching Year 9. This question doesn't test the ability to expand brackets; it tests the **concept of directed numbers** (integers) within an algebraic context.

### Difficulty Rating: 4/10
While the operation is "simple" multiplication, it ranks as a 4 because it intentionally triggers the two most common misconceptions in Key Stage 3 algebra: the sign rule and the operation confusion (adding vs. multiplying).

### Predicted Response Distributions

| Student Level | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 15% | 15% | **60%** |
| **Basic** | 25% | **35%** | 10% | 30% |
| **Proficient** | **70%** | 20% | 5% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | **98%** | 2% | 0% | 0% |

### Teacher’s Analysis of the Distribution:

*   **Below Basic (The "Adder"):** These students see two numbers and the brackets and mentally revert to addition. They see -1 and -4, and their brain processes it as $(-1) + (-4) = -5$. They choose **D** with high confidence. This is a classic "high misconception activation" response.
*   **Basic (The "Sign Neglecter"):** These students understand that "expanding" means multiplication. However, they struggle with the cognitive load of negative signs. Many will perform $1 \times 4 = 4$, but because they see minus signs in the original expression, they assume the result must be negative. They choose **B**.
*   **Proficient (The "Rule Follower"):** These students have internalised the mantra "two minuses make a plus" and have moved past the tendency to add terms when they see brackets. They correctly identify **A**.
*   **Advanced:** These students see this as a trivial "identity" check. The only errors here would be through extreme "silly mistake" negligence or misreading the question as the full expansion.

### Key Insight for Year 9:
This is a "confident wrong" question. A student who chooses **D** isn't guessing; they are applying a misaligned rule (addition) to the context. In a typical Year 9 classroom, you will see a significant divide between those who focus on the *values* (the 1 and 4) and those who correctly identify the *operation* (multiplication).
