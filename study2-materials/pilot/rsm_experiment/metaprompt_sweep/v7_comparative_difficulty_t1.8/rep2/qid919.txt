As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It is a classic "trap" question that tests decimal arithmetic and the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) rather than just substitution.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a Year 9 student, this is significantly harder than it looks. While the "recipe" is simple, it sits at a dangerous intersection of three common misconceptions: squaring decimals, multiplying before squaring (BIDMAS error), and "place value slipping" (0.3 $\times$ 0.3 = 0.9).

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working at Grade 1-2):**
These students often ignore the indices or perform the operations in the wrong order. Many will multiply $3 \times 0.3$ first to get $0.9$, then square it to get $0.81$.
*   **A=45% | B=15% | C=25% | D=15%**

**Basic (Working at Grade 3):**
These students remember they should square first, but they frequently make the most famous decimal error in secondary school: believing $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. They then do $0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$.
*   **A=10% | B=10% | C=10% | D=70%**

**Proficient (Working at Grade 4-5):**
These students are more cautious. They know $0.3^2 = 0.09$. However, a significant portion will still lose a decimal place when multiplying $3 \times 0.09$, leading them back to $2.7$, or they may select $0.27$ confidently.
*   **A=5% | B=60% | C=5% | D=30%**

**Advanced (Working at Grade 6+):**
These students have mastered decimal place value and the order of operations. They recognize $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$ and $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$ without being swayed by the "common sense" feel of 2.7.
*   **A=2% | B=95% | C=1% | D=2%**

### Teacher's Note on Misconceptions:
*   **The "Lurking" Answer (D - 2.7):** This is the strongest distractor. Students who incorrectly calculate $0.3^2 = 0.9$ will arrive at $2.7$. Because $2.7$ "looks" like a more "normal" number than $0.27$, they pick it confidently.
*   **The BIDMAS Trap (A - 0.81):** Students often read left-to-right. $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$. 
*   **The Random Guess (C - 1.8):** Usually chosen by students who double $0.3$ instead of squaring it ($3 \times 0.6$).
