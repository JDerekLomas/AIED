As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it targets a specific algebraic blind spot. While it looks simple, it is a classic "trap" for students who rely on intuitive pattern matching rather than formal inverse operations.

### **DIFFICULTY: 4/10**

For a typical Year 9 student, this is more difficult than a standard one-step equation like $10 = p + 5$ or $10 = 5p$. The variable being in the **denominator** creates a high level of "misconception activation." Many students see the numbers 10 and 5 and instinctively perform the calculation $10 \div 5 = 2$ or $10 \times 5 = 50$, failing to account for the reciprocal nature of the variable.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

#### **Below Basic (Students working at KS2 levels or roughly Grade 1-2)**
These students often look for the "easiest" relationship between the numbers. $10 \div 5 = 2$ is a very strong distractor because "10 divided by 5" feels like a natural operation to perform.
*   **A ($p=0.5$): 10%** (accidental correct through guessing or weird logic)
*   **B ($p=50$): 30%** (thinking "the opposite of division is multiplication," $10 \times 5$)
*   **C ($p=2$): 50%** (Misinterpreting $\frac{5}{p}$ as $10 \div 5$ or $p \div 5$)
*   **D (No solution): 10%** (Panic choice)

#### **Basic (Students working at a solid Grade 3 level)**
These students have started learning inverse operations. However, they frequently struggle when the unknown is on the bottom. They often use the "cover-up method" incorrectly: "What do I divide 5 by to get 10? ... Wait, nothing works... maybe it's $10 \div 5$?"
*   **A ($p=0.5$): 25%**
*   **B ($p=50$): 15%**
*   **C ($p=2$): 55%** (The most confident wrong answer for this group)
*   **D (No solution): 5%**

#### **Proficient (Students working at a solid Grade 4-5 level)**
These students are beginning to master the two-step process: multiply by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, then divide by 10. They are less likely to fall for the $p=2$ trap because they test their answer: "$5 \div 2$ isn't 10."
*   **A ($p=0.5$): 65%**
*   **B ($p=50$): 5%**
*   **C ($p=2$): 25%** (Still a persistent lure for the rushing student)
*   **D (No solution): 5%**

#### **Advanced (Students working at Grade 6+ / Top Set Year 9)**
These students recognize the structure of the equation instantly. They likely know they can swap the means and extremes ($p = 5/10$) or mentally check their answer against the original equation immediately.
*   **A ($p=0.5$): 92%**
*   **B ($p=50$): 1%**
*   **C ($p=2$): 6%** (Occasional "silly mistake" due to speed)
*   **D (No solution): 1%**

### **Teacher’s Commentary**
The danger of this question is that **Option C** is a "confident wrong" answer. Students will pick $C$ and move on without a second thought, whereas if you gave them $10 = \frac{p}{5}$, they would get $p=50$ easily. The cognitive load of dealing with $p$ as a divisor is significantly higher because it requires an extra step (multiplication before division).
