As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It’s a classic "trap" question that targets **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)**. 

While the arithmetic is simple (Year 4/5 level), the conceptual application in Year 9 is where the friction lies. Many students rely on "reading left to right" like a sentence, which leads them directly into a misconception.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a Year 9 student, the difficulty isn't the calculation; it’s the **ego-threat**. Students at this age often feel they "know" addition and division, so they rush. It sits at a 6 because it triggers a high-confidence misconception rather than a "I don't know how to do this" response.

### Predicted Response Distributions

#### **Below Basic (Working toward Grade 1-2)**
*These students almost always work left-to-right. They will add 8 and 12 first on both sides.*
* Left: $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$
* Right: $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$
* They see "8+12" and "4" on both sides and jump straight to equality.
* **A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%**

#### **Basic (Working toward Grade 3-4)**
*These students have heard of BIDMAS but apply it inconsistently. Some will remember to divide first on the left, but many will be "pulled" by the visual symmetry of the numbers.*
* Left: $8 + 3 = 11$ (Correct)
* Right: $20 \div 4 = 5$ (Correct)
* However, a significant portion will still fall for the "everything looks the same" trap or miscalculate the division.
* **A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%**

#### **Proficient (Working toward Grade 5-6)**
*These students are wary of "trick" questions. They will actively write "BIDMAS" on the side of their paper. They will calculate the left side as 11 and the right side as 5.*
* Most will identify that $11 > 5$.
* Small errors may occur if they perform $12 \div 4$ and then forget to add the 8.
* **A=75% B=10% C=10% D=5%**

#### **Advanced (Working toward Grade 7-9)**
*These students will solve this mentally in seconds. They might not even calculate the full value; they will observe that on the left, only the 12 is being divided, whereas on the right, the entire sum is being divided. Since $8 + 3$ is clearly larger than $(8+12)/4$, they pick A immediately.*
* **A=96% B=2% C=1% D=1%**

### Teacher's Reflection: "The Confidence Trap"
This is a high **"Confidently Wrong"** question. In a typical Year 9 classroom, the most common wrong answer (C) will be shouted out the fastest. The distribution is "Bimodal"—students either know the rule and get it right (A), or they don't apply the rule and are almost certain the answer is (C). Very few students will choose B or D, as they don't align with the common misconceptions.
