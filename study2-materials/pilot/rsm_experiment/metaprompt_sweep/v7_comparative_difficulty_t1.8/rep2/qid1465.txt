This is a classic "trapped" order of operations question. While the calculations themselves are Year 4 level, the placement of the subtraction before the addition and the multiplication at the end makes it a high-misconception task.

In my experience, many students fall into the **"Left-to-Right" trap** or the **"Strict BIDMAS" trap** (believing Addition must physically come before Subtraction because 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym).

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
*Note: For Year 9, the arithmetic is trivial, but the conceptual understanding of operator precedence is often shakier than teachers expect.*

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working below Grade 4 level):**
These students often calculate linearly from left to right, ignoring precedence entirely.
*   **A=10% | B=20% | C=10% | D=60%**
*   *Logic for D:* $(3 - 5 = -2) \rightarrow (-2 + 4 = 2) \rightarrow (2 \times 2 = 4)$... wait, many will do $(3-5+4) \times 2 = 4 \times 2 = 8$ (not an option) or simple sign errors leading to D.

**Basic (Working at Grade 4 level):**
High misconception activation. These students know BIDMAS exists but misapply it.
*   **A=30% | B=50% | C=15% | D=5%**
*   *The "B" Trap:* They do the Multiplication first ($4 \times 2 = 8$), then Addition ($5 + 8 = 13$), then Subtraction ($3 - 13 = -10$, but often lose the sign or flip it to reach $10$ or $4$). **B is the "Confident Incorrect" choice** here: $3 - (5+8) = 3-13$, but many will intuitively group the $(5+4)$ because they see the addition sign.

**Proficient (Working at Grade 5/6 level):**
Most have mastered the hierarchy but may still slip on the directed number aspect.
*   **A=75% | B=15% | C=5% | D=5%**
*   *Logic for A:* Correct order ($8 + 3 - 5 = 6$). However, the "Addition before Subtraction" myth still persists in about 1 in 5 students at this level.

**Advanced (Working at Grade 7+ level):**
These students treat addition and subtraction as equal priority and handle the negative 5 correctly.
*   **A=98% | B=1% | C=1% | D=0%**
*   At this level, "Addition/Subtraction" is viewed as a single tier of operations. Errors are rare and usually down to rushing.

### Teacher's Note on Option B
Option B is the "Distractor of Death." Students who have been taught BIDMAS as a rigid ladder rather than a set of tiers will calculate $5+4$ first, or calculate $4 \times 2 = 8$, then add the $5$ to get $13$, then subtract. The fact that $3 - (5 + 8)$ is $-10$ often leads them to choose B because they "dropped a sign" or C if they multiplied throughout. **The most common correct pathway is $3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = 6$.**
