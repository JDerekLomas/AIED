As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it targets one of the most persistent misconceptions in secondary education: the literal interpretation of the BIDMAS/BODMAS acronym.

### Difficulty Rating: 4/10
While the arithmetic is simple, the conceptual trap is high. For a Year 9 class, this is not a "hard" question in terms of complexity, but it is a "trick" question that exposes a lack of deep understanding of operator precedence.

### The Pedagogy
The "trap" lies in **Problem P**. Many students are taught **BIDMAS**, where 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction). This leads them to believe they must do $5+6$ first, regardless of the left-to-right rule.
In **Problem Q**, the rule is more robustly understood: Multiplication always comes before Addition.

**Correct Answer: B** ($4-5$ happens first in P because addition/subtraction have equal priority; $5 \times 6$ happens first in Q because multiplication has higher priority).

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic**
*Students at this level often lack a formal grasp of order of operations and tend to calculate strictly from left to right, or they guess based on the "easiest" numbers.*
* **A=55%** (Pure left-to-right approach)
* **B=15%** (Guessing)
* **C=10%** (Confused)
* **D=20%** (Vague memory that $\times$ is important)

**Basic**
*These students have learned the acronym BIDMAS but take it literally. This is the "high misconception" zone.*
* **A=15%**
* **B=20%**
* **C=10%**
* **D=55%** (The "BIDMAS Trap": Thinking Addition MUST come before Subtraction, and Multiplication before Addition)

**Proficient**
*Students at this level have begun to understand that M/D and A/S are equal-priority pairs, though some still slip up under pressure.*
* **A=5%**
* **B=75%** (Understand the left-to-right rule for A/S)
* **C=2%**
* **D=18%** (Occasional regression to literal BIDMAS)

**Advanced**
*These students treat A/S as equal priority and often view subtraction as adding a negative number, making the order of P irrelevant to the final result, but identifying the convention correctly.*
* **A=2%**
* **B=95%**
* **C=1%**
* **D=2%**

### Teacher's Note:
Expect a "Confident Incorrect" response from the middle-ability (Basic) cohort. They will choose **D** and be prepared to argue for it because "the A comes before the S in the name." This is why many UK teachers are moving toward writing the acronym as:
**B**
**I**
**DM**
**AS**
to show the tiered priority.
