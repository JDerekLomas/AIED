As an experienced UK maths teacher, I’ve seen thousands of students tackle linear equations. This specific question is a "wolf in sheep's clothing." While it looks like a simple substitution, the structure is designed to catch out students who rely on rote patterns rather than algebraic fluency.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a Year 9 student, this is slightly above "standard" difficulty. 
**The challenge isn't the calculation; it's the rearrangement.**
1.  **The \(y\) substitution:** Students are used to tables where they find \(y\) given \(x\). Providing \(y\) and asking for \(x\) reverses the flow.
2.  **The Negative Coefficient:** The \(-6y\) is a major "misconception activator." Students often drop the sign or fail to add it correctly to the other side.
3.  **The Decimal:** \(0.5\) is easy, but it makes students feel they shouldn't use a calculator, leading to mental arithmetic slips.

**Correct Working:** 
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33 \rightarrow x = 3.3$

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to Misconceptions:**
*   **C (Correct):** $10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 33 \rightarrow 3.3$
*   **D (The Sign Error):** $10x + 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 27 \rightarrow 2.7$. (Students add $6 \times 0.5$ but think they need to subtract it from 30).
*   **A (The 'Flipped' Error):** Substituting $x=0.5$ to find $y$: $5 - 6y = 30 \rightarrow -6y = 25 \rightarrow y = -4.16$ (rounding to 4.25).

#### **below_basic (Working at KS3 Stage 3/4)**
*A=15% B=15% C=30% D=40%*
At this level, students see the "-" and "30" and instinctively think they need to subtract to "get smaller." They will perform $30 - 3 = 27$ then divide by 10. They are "confident" in their wrong answer because $2.7$ looks like a "maths teacher answer."

#### **basic (Targeting GCSE Grade 3/4)**
*A=10% B=10% C=45% D=35%*
These students know to substitute, but their "change side, change sign" rules are shaky. Many will still fall into the trap of calculating $10x = 30 - 3$. C and D will be a toss-up.

#### **proficient (Targeting GCSE Grade 5/6)**
*A=5% B=5% C=75% D=15%*
These students can handle the two-step equation. The majority will correctly add 3 to 30. Errors here are usually due to rushing or basic arithmetic "brain farts."

#### **advanced (Targeting GCSE Grade 7+)**
*A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%*
High-achievers will find this trivial. They will instantly see the structure and might even solve it mentally without writing steps. If they fail, it's usually due to misreading $y$ as $x$.

**Teacher's Note:** This is an excellent diagnostic question. If a class predominantly picks **D**, it's a signal that they don't understand the "balance" method of equations and are instead following a "left-to-right" arithmetic flow.
