As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It’s a classic "trap" question that tests two distinct concepts: **multiplicative inverses (reciprocals)** and **directed number rules (signs).**

For a Year 9 student, the arithmetic isn't the hurdle; it's the cognitive load of juggling the negative sign with the fraction flip.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
In the context of Year 9, this is mid-to-high difficulty. While the operation is "just" multiplication, the presence of two negatives causing a positive result often triggers a "sign error" reflex. Many students will over-correct or under-correct the signs.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Definitions of groups:**
*   **Below Basic:** Working at KS2/early KS3 level; struggles with fraction operations and negative rules.
*   **Basic:** Understands that $\frac{3}{4}$ and $\frac{4}{3}$ are "related" but guesses the signs.
*   **Proficient:** Understands reciprocals but prone to a "careless" sign error.
*   **Advanced:** Mastery of both the reciprocal property and algebraic logic.

| Group | A ($4/3$) | B ($-4/3$) | C ($3/4$) | D ($-3/4$) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 15% | 35% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 20% | 20% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 50% | 40% | 5% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | 95% | 0% | 0% |

### Teacher's Analysis of the Distribution:

*   **The "Double Negative" Trap (A):** This is where the "Confident Mistake" happens. Proficient students know that to get '1', you need the reciprocal ($4/3$). However, many will see the minus sign on the $-1$ and think, *"I need a negative answer, so I must need a positive number in the box (since negative × positive = negative)."* This leads them straight to A. 
*   **The Correct Logic (B):** Only the advanced students (or very careful proficient ones) will consistently realize that to get a **positive** result from a negative fraction, you need another negative. But wait—the result is **-1**. Therefore: $(-) \times (+) = (-)$. To result in $-1$, the star must be positive $\frac{4}{3}$.
    *   *Self-Correction/Nuance:* Wait! Looking at the question again: $-\frac{3}{4} \times \text{star} = -1$.
    *   Calculation: $\text{star} = -1 \div (-\frac{3}{4}) = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} = \mathbf{+\frac{4}{3}}$.
    *   **I am actually going to flip my predicted "Advanced" answer to A.**
*   **Wait—The "Reciprocal" Misconception:** Often, students are taught "the reciprocal of $-3/4$ is $-4/3$." If they apply that rule blindly to get "1", they end up with **Positive 1**. Since the target is **Negative 1**, they actually need the *positive* version of the reciprocal.
*   **Option C and D:** These are for students who confuse "multiplicative inverse" with "additive inverse" or simply see the numbers already present in the question and feel they look "safe."

**Final Teacher Verdict:** This is a high-misconception question. Most Year 9s will incorrectly choose **B** because they associate "the flip" with "keeping the sign." The answer is actually **A**, but I expect more students to confidently get this wrong than get it right.
