As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this as a classic "low ceiling, high floor" diagnostic question. It tests more than just substitution; it tests a student’s ability to handle **implicit equations** (where $y$ is not the subject) and their reaction to a **zero value**.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
For a typical Year 9 student, the arithmetic is simple ($4 \times 0$), but the structure of the equation ($4x + 2y = 10$) is a significant hurdle. Most Year 9s are accustomed to $y = mx + c$. When they see $x$ and $y$ on the same side, their "procedural fluency" often trips over their "conceptual understanding."

### Predictor Analysis
*   **The Trap (Option C):** This is a high-misconception question. Students often see $x=0$ and automatically assume the answer is the "number at the end" (the constant term), or they simply solve $2y=10$ but mentally bypass the $y$ coefficient because they are rushing.
*   **The Random Guess (Option A):** Students who struggle with the concept of substitution see $4, 2, 10$ and $x, y$ and simply try to multiply numbers together $(4 \times 5 \text{ or } 2 \times 10)$.
*   **The Halving Error (Option D):** Students who confuse $x$ and $y$ or try to divide 10 by 4.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working at Grade 1-2):**
*These students struggle with the equals sign and the concept of a variable.*
**A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%**
*Reasoning:* Large numbers like 20 "feel" like math answers. However, many will see the 10 and the 0 and try to find a way to get 5 (C) or simply guess.

**Basic (Working at Grade 3-4):**
*These students can substitute but often fail to rearrange or handle coefficients correctly.*
**A=10% B=30% C=50% D=10%**
*Reasoning:* This is the "Confidentially Wrong" zone. They see $4(0) + 2y = 10$, ignore the $4(0)$, and then often pick 5 because they either think $y$ is just the constant or they divide 10 by the wrong number.

**Proficient (Working at Grade 5-6):**
*These students are systematic but prone to "silly" arithmetic slips.*
**A=2% B=75% C=15% D=8%**
*Reasoning:* Most will correctly calculate $2y = 10$ therefore $y = 5$... wait, $y = 5$ is B? No, they will solve it correctly as $y = 5$. *Wait—re-evaluating the options:*

> **Teacher's Note:** I noticed a potential trick in my own head—if $x=0$, $2y=10$, so $y=5$. **Option C is the correct answer.** I must ensure students don't confuse the $x$-coefficient.

**Advanced (Working at Grade 7+):**
**A=0% B=2% C=97% D=1%**
*Reasoning:* At this level, $x=0$ is recognized immediately as the y-intercept. They will mentally cover the $4x$ term and solve $2y=10$ instantly.

### Final Distribution Summary
| Cohort | A (20) | B (3) | C (5) | D (2.5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 30% | 15% | **45%** | 10% |
| **Basic** | 10% | 10% | **70%** | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 2% | 3% | **93%** | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 0% | 0% | **100%** | 0% |

**Key Insight:** This question is unlikely to result in random guessing. Most students will arrive at **C** correctly, but those who fail will likely do so by over-complicating the 0 or incorrectly performing the inverse operation on the coefficient 2.
