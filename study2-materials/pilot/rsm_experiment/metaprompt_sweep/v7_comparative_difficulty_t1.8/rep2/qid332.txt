As an experienced UK maths teacher, this is a classic "conceptual trap" question. It doesn’t just test the ability to solve an equation; it tests the understanding of **the order of operations in inverse form** and the **application of an operation to every term in an equation.**

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 student, this is more difficult than a standard "Solve for $x$" question because it forces them to evaluate someone else's logic. Most Year 9s are taught the "balancing" method where they add 5 first. Katie’s method (multiplying by 3 first) is a very high-frequency misconception.

### Teacher’s Analysis
*   **Tom** is correct because he added 5 to both sides first ($12 + 5 = 17$). This is the conventional first step.
*   **Katie** is **incorrect** because if she multiplies by 3, she must multiply *every* term. Her line should be $x - 15 = 36$.
*   **The Trap:** Students often believe that as long as they do the "opposite" (multiplication for division), the order doesn't matter or that they only need to multiply the terms they "want" to change.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working at Grade 1-2):**
These students often struggle with fractions and inverse operations. Many will see "divide by 3" and "multiply by 3" and assume Katie must be right without checking the -5.
*   **A=15% B=40% C=30% D=15%**

**Basic (Working at Grade 3-4):**
These students have been drilled to "add 5 first." They will recognize Tom is correct. However, because Katie's $12 \times 3 = 36$ "looks right," they often assume there is more than one way to do it and drift toward Option C (the "safe" choice).
*   **A=40% B=15% C=40% D=5%**

**Proficient (Working at Grade 5-6):**
This group is generally confident. Most will correctly identify Tom as right. The best among them will test Katie’s method by actually trying to solve it and realizing the -5 is a problem, though a significant minority will still fall for the "Both" trap.
*   **A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%**

**Advanced (Working at Grade 7+):**
These students understand that multiplication must be applied to the whole side of an equation (the distributive property). They will spot Katie's error immediately.
*   **A=90% B=2% C=6% D=2%**

### Final Distribution Summary Table

| Category | A (Tom) | B (Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 40% | 30% | 15% |
| **Basic** | 40% | 15% | 40% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 65% | 5% | 25% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 90% | 2% | 6% | 2% |

**Note on "Confidently Wrong":** This is a high-misconception question. You will see many "Basic" students choosing **C** with high confidence because they have been told "maths is flexible" but haven't yet mastered the rigour of distributive multiplication.
