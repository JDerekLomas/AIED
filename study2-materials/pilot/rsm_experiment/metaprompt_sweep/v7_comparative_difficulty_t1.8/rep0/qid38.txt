As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific problem frequently in Year 9 assessments. It sits at a crucial intersection of two topics: **adding fractions** (arithmetic) and **algebraic manipulation**.

The presence of the $2x$ and the $x$ is a deliberate "distractor trap." Students often focus on the numbers and the $x$ separately rather than treating the denominator as a single term.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 student, this is slightly above average difficulty. While the arithmetic is simple ($3+8$), the conceptual hurdle of "finding a common denominator" when variables are involved often leads to high-confidence errors.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to options:**
*   **A ($11/2x$):** The correct answer. Requires scaling the second fraction to $8/2x$.
*   **B ($7/3x$):** The "add across" error ($3+4$ and $2x+x$). High misconception activation.
*   **C ($11/x$):** Calculation error or partial scaling (getting the 11 but losing the 2).
*   **D ($7/2x$):** The "forgot to scale" error (simply adding numerators over the larger denominator).

| Student Level | A (Correct) | B (Add Across) | C (Misc) | D (No scaling) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | **60%** | 10% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 25% | **45%** | 10% | 20% |
| **Proficient** | **65%** | 15% | 5% | 15% |
| **Advanced** | **95%** | 2% | 1% | 2% |

### Teacher's Commentary:
*   **Below Basic / Basic:** These students will overwhelmingly choose **B**. They apply the most common misconception in all of fraction arithmetic: "add the tops, add the bottoms." They feel confident because $7$ and $3$ appear so naturally from the numbers provided.
*   **Proficient:** These students recognise they need a common denominator. However, many will still choose **D** because they intuitively feel the $2x$ is "already there," so they just add $3+4$ and keep the $2x$.
*   **The Trap:** This is a "confident wrong" question. Very few students will guess randomly; most who get it wrong will do so because they have firmly held (but incorrect) procedural rules.
