As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It is a classic "wolf in sheep’s clothing." While it looks like a simple substitution, it targets three specific cognitive hurdles simultaneously: the order of operations (BIDMAS), squaring decimals, and place value.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this is harder than it looks. It sits at a 6 because while the "recipe" is simple, the mental traps are high-friction. This is a high-misconception question rather than a random-guessing one; students will arrive at wrong answers with a high degree of confidence.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working at Grade 1–2):**
These students often struggle with BIDMAS or basic arithmetic. They are likely to multiply $3 \times 0.3$ first ($0.9$) and then square it, leading them to A. Alternatively, they may ignore the power and just do $3 \times 0.3 \times 2$ (option C).
*   **A=40% B=15% C=35% D=10%**

**Basic (Working at Grade 3):**
These students know to square first, but they frequently make the "decimal squaring error." They will think $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. Then $0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$. They will choose D, feeling very confident they have followed the steps correctly.
*   **A=15% B=20% C=15% D=50%**

**Proficient (Working at Grade 4–5):**
These students are more careful. They recognise $0.3^2 = 0.09$. However, the final calculation of $3 \times 0.09$ still presents a decimal multiplication risk. Some might slip back into the $0.9$ trap at the last second or lose a decimal place.
*   **A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%**

**Advanced (Working at Grade 6+):**
These students treat $0.3$ as $3/10$, making the calculation $(3/10)^2 = 9/100$. They see $3 \times 0.09$ and correctly identify the answer.
*   **A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%**

### Teacher's Note: The "Confidently Wrong" Factor
The most common answer in a standard Year 9 set will likely be **D ($2.7$)**. 

Students often skip the place value check for decimals under 1. They see $3^2=9$ and $3 \times 9 = 27$, so any answer with "27" in it feels correct. Option D feels "right-sized" to them, whereas $0.27$ feels "too small." Option A is the trap for those who ignore BIDMAS (Squaring $0.9$).
