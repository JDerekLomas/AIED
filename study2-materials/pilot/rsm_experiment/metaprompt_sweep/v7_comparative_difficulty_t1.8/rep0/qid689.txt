As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it targets a specific "cognitive tripwire" in algebra. While it looks simple, it involves a variable in the denominator, which is a major hurdle for Year 9 students.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 class (approx. age 13-14), this is a "deceptively difficult" question. While the arithmetic is easy ($10, 5$), the algebraic structure requires students to understand that the operation is division, not multiplication. This is higher than a standard one-step equation because many students have a "learned reflex" to multiply the two visible numbers when they see a fraction.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key Misconceptions:**
*   **The "Multiplication Reflex" (B):** Students see 10 and 5 and immediately multiply them ($10 \times 5 = 50$). 
*   **The "Linear Reflex" (C):** Students treat $\frac{5}{p}$ as if it were $5p$, solving $5p=10$ to get $p=2$.
*   **The Inverse Confusion (A):** Students realise they need to divide, but they do $10 \div 5$ (which gives 2) or $5 \div 10$ (correctly resulting in 0.5).

#### Below Basic (Working below age-related expectations)
*Most will follow a "number-crunching" instinct rather than algebraic rules.*
**A=15% | B=50% | C=25% | D=10%**
*   **Analysis:** Distractor **B** dominates here. Students at this level often associate fractions in equations with multiplication ("I need to get rid of the fraction, so I multiply").

#### Basic (Working at age-related expectations - lower tier)
*These students are beginning to use inverse operations but apply them inconsistently.*
**A=30% | B=30% | C=35% | D=5%**
*   **Analysis:** High "Confident Wrongness." You will see an even split between those who multiply (**B**) and those who mistake the structure for $5p=10$ (**C**). A few will correctly identify $p$ as $0.5$ but often through trial and error rather than rearranging.

#### Proficient (Working at age-related expectations - upper tier)
*These students have moved past the multiplication reflex and are testing the values.*
**A=65% | B=10% | C=20% | D=5%**
*   **Analysis:** Most will get the correct answer. The primary distractor remains **C**, as students in a rush often flip the operation to $10 \div 5$. However, proficient students are likely to "check" if $5 \div 2 = 10$ and realize it doesn't work.

#### Advanced (Working above age-related expectations)
*These students understand that $p$ and $10$ can effectively "swap places" via algebraic manipulation.*
**A=95% | B=1% | C=4% | D=0%**
*   **Analysis:** At this level, students treat this as a "one-glance" problem. The only errors here are "silly mistakes" where they mentally process $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$.
