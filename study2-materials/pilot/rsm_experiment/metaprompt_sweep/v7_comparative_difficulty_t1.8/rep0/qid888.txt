This is a classic "bread and butter" GCSE-style question that specifically targets one of the most persistent misconceptions in secondary algebra: the multiplication of two negative integers.

In a Year 9 context, this is a question where students often feel **confident but are prone to systematic error**, rather than guessing randomly.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
While the concept of expanding double brackets is a mid-level skill (Grade 4 at GCSE), the specific manipulation of signs makes this a "high-distractor" task. It sits below completing the square because it follows a repeatable mnemonic (FOIL or the Grid Method), but it’s harder than basic single-bracket expansion.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working towards GCSE Grade 2/3):**
These students likely remember FOIL/Grid method but have major issues with directed numbers. They see $-5$ and $-7$ and often perform $-7 + 5$ or simply forget that a negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive.
*   **A=40% B=15% C=15% D=30%**
*   *Logic:* Option A is a common "difference" error. Option D is the most popular wrong answer here, as they correctly add $5+7$ but assume the product must stay negative.

**Basic (Working towards GCSE Grade 4):**
These students are proficient with the method of expansion but are "confidently wrong" regarding the final constant. The "minus times a minus" rule is often forgotten under pressure.
*   **A=10% B=45% C=10% D=35%**
*   *Logic:* This group narrows it down to B and D. D is the primary trap—they get the $-12m$ middle term correct but fail on the $-5 \times -7$ calculation.

**Proficient (Working towards GCSE Grade 5/6):**
The majority of these students have automated the rule "negative times negative equals positive."
*   **A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%**
*   *Logic:* Errors here are usually due to "exam fog" or rushing. They know the signs, but some might still slip on the constant term (Option D).

**Advanced (Working towards GCSE Grade 7+):**
For these students, this is a "check and move on" question.
*   **A=0% B=98% C=0% D=2%**
*   *Logic:* Accuracy should be near perfect. Any errors are purely clerical.

### Teacher's Note on Misconceptions:
The "High Misconception Activation" here is focused on **Option D**. In my experience, a significant portion of Year 9s believe that because the expression is full of minus signs, the answer "looks" like it should also be full of minus signs. 

*   **A** targets students who subtract the numbers $(7-5=2)$ instead of adding/collecting like terms.
*   **C** targets those who simply ignore all signs and treat everything as positive.
*   **D** is the "Professional Distractor" that catches students who get the addition part of the expansion right but the multiplication part wrong.
