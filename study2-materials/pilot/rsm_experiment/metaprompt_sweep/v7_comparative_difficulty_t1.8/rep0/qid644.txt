As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question as a classic "distractor" test. While the operation itself is basic arithmetic, the context (algebraic expansion) and the specific numbers chosen are designed to trigger two very common Year 9 misconceptions: **the additive error** and **the sign error.**

### DIFFICULTY: 3/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this is technically a "low demand" skill, but it has high **misconception activation**. Students often go on "autopilot" when they see brackets and mistakenly apply addition instead of multiplication, or they struggle with the "double negative" rule.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**below_basic (Working at KS3 Stage 3/4):**
*These students often confuse operations. They see 1 and 4 and, distracted by the process of "collecting" terms, they add them.*
*   **A=10% | B=20% | C=25% | D=45%**
*   **Analysis:** D is the most popular wrong answer here. They see $-1$ and $-4$, and their brain performs $-1 - 4 = -5$. B is also common because they ignore the negative on the 1.

**basic (Grade 2/3 target):**
*These students know they need to multiply, but the rule for signs is not yet embedded. They are likely to correctly identify the "4" but miss the "positive" result.*
*   **A=40% | B=35% | C=5% | D=20%**
*   **Analysis:** This group is split. Many will calculate $1 \times 4 = 4$, but because they see two minus signs, they might think the answer "stays negative" or simply forget to check the sign entirely (leading to B).

**proficient (Grade 4/5 target):**
*These students are familiar with FOIL/Grid Method. They are specifically looking for the "trap."*
*   **A=85% | B=5% | C=0% | D=10%**
*   **Analysis:** Most will get this right. The small percentage for D represents students who move too quickly and default to "collecting like terms" (adding) instead of multiplying.

**advanced (Grade 6+ target):**
*These students have high fluency in directed numbers and algebraic manipulation.*
*   **A=98% | B=1% | C=0% | D=1%**
*   **Analysis:** Almost universal success. Errors here are almost exclusively "slips" (calculation errors) rather than conceptual misunderstandings.

### Teacher's Note:
This is a high-confidence "wrong" question. The most dangerous distractor is **D (-5)**. Students who choose D often feel they have done the math correctly because $-1 - 4$ does indeed equal $-5$; they have simply performed the wrong operation for expanding brackets. In a classroom, I would use this question as a "starter" to highlight the difference between **multiplying** (expanding) and **adding** (simplifying).
