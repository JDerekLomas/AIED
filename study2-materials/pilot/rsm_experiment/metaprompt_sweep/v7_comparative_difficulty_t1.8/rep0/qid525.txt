This is a classic "procedural vs. conceptual" check. For a Year 9 student, adding fractions is a recurring topic, yet it remains one of the most persistent areas for misconceptions.

The presence of **Distractor D** makes this a "high misconception" question rather than a guessing game. It targets the "add the tops, add the bottoms" error which is arguably the most famous mistake in secondary mathematics.

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**
While the arithmetic is simple (10 and 4 are friendly numbers for a common denominator), the multi-step nature—finding a common denominator, converting parts, and handling the mixed number format—pushes it past a simple calculation.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

| Group | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 5% | 15% | 10% | **70%** |
| **Basic** | 20% | **45%** | 5% | 30% |
| **Proficient** | 10% | **85%** | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | **94%** | 1% | 0% |

### **Teacher’s Analysis of the Options:**

*   **Option B (Correct - $4 \frac{19}{20}$):** The student successfully found the common denominator (20) and added correctly: $2 \frac{14}{20} + 2 \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$.
*   **Option D (The "Confident" Wrong Answer - $4 \frac{8}{14}$):** This will be the most popular choice for struggling students. They add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), then add the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$). This feels "logical" to a student who hasn't internalized the concept of equivalent parts.
*   **Option A (The "I was taught a rule" Error - $\frac{99}{20}$):** This is the correct value but ignores the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number." Proficient students often default to improper fractions because GCSE examiners generally prefer them.
*   **Option C (The Denominator Product Error - $\frac{99}{40}$):** This attracts students who know they need to multiply the denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but then get lost in the conversion, failing to adjust the numerators or accidentally doubling the value they were looking for.

**Summary for Year 9:** If this were a non-calculator starter, expect a significant split. The "Below Basic" group will pick **D** instantly and move on, feeling confident they have finished the question quickly. Your "Basic" students will hesitate, try to find a common denominator, but may still fall for the improper fraction trap (A) or make a calculation error.
