As an experienced UK maths teacher, I would categorize this question as a test of **notation and syntax** rather than numerical ability. In Year 9 (ages 13-14), students are moving away from the $\div$ symbol toward fractional notation.

The main challenge here isn't "doing the math," but understanding the **invisible brackets** created by a vinculum (fraction bar).

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this is an "easy-intermediate" question. It falls below a 5 because it requires no manipulation, but it is higher than a 2 because it tests a specific formal convention that contradicts how they may have used a calculator in the past.

### Response Distribution Prediction

The primary "confidence trap" here is **Option C**. Students often forget that in a fraction, the bar acts as a grouping symbol. If they are thinking linearly (left-to-right), they might associate the division only with the term immediately following it.

*   **Below Basic:** These students struggle with the visual structure of algebra. They are highly likely to pick **D** (reversing the divisor) or **B** (trying to "balance" the terms by adding 4 to the top).
*   **Basic:** These students understand that division looks like a fraction but often fail on the "order of operations" within that fraction. **C** is the classic "confidently wrong" choice for this group.
*   **Proficient:** These students have internalized that the denominator represents the *entire* divisor. They should select **A** comfortably.
*   **Advanced:** This should be an instantaneous 5-second answer with near 100% accuracy.

| Group | A (Correct) | B (Illogical) | C (The Trap) | D (The Reverse) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 30% | 20% | 20% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 50% | 5% | 35% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 0% | 10% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 0% | 1% | 1% |

### Teacher’s Notes on Misconceptions:
*   **Option C (The Order of Operations Error):** This is the high-activation misconception. Students who view math as a "string of characters" read $c \div h$ first, write $\frac{c}{h}$, and then just "tack on" the $+4$ at the end. They fail to realize that the parentheses in the original question force $h+4$ to be a single entity (the denominator).
*   **Option D (The Orientation Error):** Usually occurs in students who still think of the fraction bar as "goes into." They see the $c$ first and subconsciously place it inside the "bus stop," which in fraction form leads them to put the $c$ on the bottom.
