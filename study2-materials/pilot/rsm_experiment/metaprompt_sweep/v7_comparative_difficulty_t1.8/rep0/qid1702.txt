As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. On the surface, it is a straightforward substitution and rearrangement task. However, for a Year 9 student, it contains several "friction points": a non-unit coefficient for $y$, a decimal input, and the requirement to isolate $x$ rather than the usual $y$.

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**

While the arithmetic isn’t at a "Level 10" complexity, the **misconception activation** is high. Students often perform "malrules" (incorrect algebraic shortcuts) when decimals and negative signs are involved.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Key for Categories (Year 9 UK context):**
*   **Below Basic:** Working at KS3 Stage 3/4 (struggles with basic linear equations).
*   **Basic:** Working at KS3 Stage 5/6 (can substitute into $y = mx + c$).
*   **Proficient:** Working at GCSE Foundation/Higher crossover (can rearrange 2-step equations).
*   **Advanced:** Target Grade 7-9 (fluent in algebra with non-integers).

| Group | A (4.25) | B (-4.25) | C (3.3) | D (2.7) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 15% | **55%** | 20% |
| **Basic** | **45%** | 10% | 30% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | **70%** | 10% | 5% | 15% |
| **Advanced** | **95%** | 2% | 1% | 2% |

### **Teacher’s Analysis of the Options:**

*   **A) 3.3 (The Correct Answer):**
    $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$.
    It requires three distinct steps: multiplication, addition across the equals sign, and division.

*   **C) 2.7 (The "Sign Error" Distractor):**
    This is the most common error for **Proficient** students. They substitute correctly but subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding: $10x = 30 - 3 = 27$. It’s a classic "change side, don't change sign" mistake.

*   **A) 4.25 (The "Term Swapper" Distractor):**
    This is highly attractive to **Below Basic/Basic** students. They often confuse which variable is which or attempt to solve for $y$ despite $y$ being given. Many will see $10 - 6 = 4$ and then try to adjust for the $0.5$, or they may calculate $(30 + 10 + 6) / 4$. Curiously, if a student does $30/6 + 0.5 \div 2$, they land near here. It represents "number grabbing" without a structural understanding of the equation.

*   **B) -4.25 (The "Negative Guess"):**
    Usually chosen by students who see a minus sign in the equation and feel the answer "should probably be negative," often guessing between A and B.

### **Summary of Student Behavior:**
For a Year 9 class, this is a "confident wrong" question. The most common error isn't guessing; it's the **Sign Error (leading to 2.7)**. If this were a non-calculator paper, you would see the error rate for $33 \div 10$ spike even higher as students over-complicate the division.
