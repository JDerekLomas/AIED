As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It appears simple, but it is a classic "trap" question that specifically targets weak proportional reasoning and a misunderstanding of inverse operations when fractions are involved.

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 student, this is more difficult than it looks. While the algebraic step ($p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3$) is Year 7 material, the execution involves fraction division. This is a high **misconception activation** question; many students will perform a calculation confidently but incorrectly.

### The Misconceptions
*   **The "Multiplying" Error:** Students see 3 and 12 and instinctively want to multiply them to get 36, but many will then place the 36 in the wrong part of the fraction or struggle with whether to multiply or divide.
*   **The "3 into 12" Error (Option A):** This is the most common pitfall. Students see 3 and 12, think "3 goes into 12 four times," and choose $1/4$. They are subconsciously treating the equation as $3 \div p = 12$ or $12 \div 3$.
*   **The "Integer" Bias (Option C):** Students who dislike fractions will often find a way to make the answer a whole number, usually by dividing 12 by 3.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working at KS2 levels/Below GCSE Grade 1)**
*Students at this level often guess based on "number bonds" they see between 3 and 12.*
**A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%**
*Reasoning: Majority will go for $1/4$ or 4 because $12 \div 3 = 4$. Very few will correctly perform $12 \times 3$.*

**Basic (Working at Grade 2/3)**
*Students know they need to divide by 3, but struggle with how to divide a fraction by an integer.*
**A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%**
*Reasoning: "A" remains the dominant distractor. "B" starts to appear as some remember to multiply the denominator, but "D" is a common "muddled" guess (mixing up $3^2$ or similar).*

**Proficient (Working at Grade 4/5)**
*These students are systematic but prone to "silly" mistakes under pressure.*
**A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%**
*Reasoning: Most will correctly apply $p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$. The distractor "A" still catches those who rush and think $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$ is "a third of twelve".*

**Advanced (Working at Grade 6+)**
*High confidence and fluency with fractions.*
**A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%**
*Reasoning: Nearly all will get this correct. The very few errors will be pure transcription slips.*

### Summary of predicted performance:
The most common wrong answer will be **A**. Students who are "confidently wrong" will see the numbers 3 and 12 and leap to the number 4 without writing down the intermediate step of $\frac{1}{12} \div \frac{3}{1}$.
