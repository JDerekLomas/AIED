This is a classic "subject-manipulation" question that tests two distinct skills: recall of the geometric formula and the algebraic ability to rearrange that formula. 

For a Year 9 student, this is often more difficult than a calculation question because it is **abstract**. There are no numbers to "plug in," which often causes "mathematical paralysis" in middle-set students.

### DIFFICULTY: 8/10
In the context of Year 9, this is a high-difficulty task. While "Completing the Square" (Difficulty 10) is a more complex procedure, this question requires working backwards through a cube root and a fraction, which is a major hurdle. 

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key Misconceptions:**
*   **The "Multiplying by the Fraction" Error:** Students often see $4/3$ and think they must multiply the other side by $4/3$ to move it, leading them to Option B.
*   **The "Visual Pattern" Error:** Students who don't know the formula might pick Option A because it "looks" like the sphere formula elements are all present in a line.
*   **Operation Order:** Poor algebraic flow leads students to leave the $4\pi$ as a coefficient outside the root (Option D).

| Category | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 40% | 30% | 10% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 45% | 15% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 10% | 25% | 55% | 10% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 3% | 93% | 2% |

### Teacher’s Analysis:

1.  **Below Basic:** These students often pick **A** because it contains the correct components of the sphere formula ($4, \pi, 3$) in a familiar-looking grouping, regardless of algebraic logic. They guess based on "familiarity."
2.  **Basic:** This is the **high-misconception** group. They know they need to rearrange $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. They usually make a mistake with the fraction first. They try to "move" the $3$ but end up dividing by $3$ or incorrectly associating the $\pi$, leading them strongly toward **B**.
3.  **Proficient:** These students correctly identify that to isolate $r$, they must multiply by $3$ and divide by $4\pi$. They are the most likely to correctly land on **C**, though a small number will fall for the "3 over 4" vs "4 over 3" trap if they rush.
4.  **Advanced:** These students treat the formula as a literal equation. They will likely perform the rearrangement mentally ($3V \rightarrow \div 4\pi \rightarrow \sqrt[3]{\dots}$) and reach **C** with high confidence.

**Verdict:** This question effectively distinguishes between those who have "memorised" a formula and those who "understand" algebraic balance. Most Year 9 students will find the inverse of $\frac{4}{3}$ counter-intuitive.
