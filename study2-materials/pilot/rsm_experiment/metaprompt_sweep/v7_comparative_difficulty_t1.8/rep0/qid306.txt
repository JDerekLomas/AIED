This is a fascinating diagnostic question because it targets a very specific "fossilised" misconception in British schools regarding the BIDMAS (or BODMAS) acronym.

### Difficulty Rating: 5/10
While the arithmetic itself is Year 3/4 level, the conceptual application of order of operations—specifically the relationship between Addition and Subtraction—remains a persistent "trap" even for Year 9s. Most students will be overly confident in an incorrect mental model.

### The Pedagogical Trap
The danger here is **Problem P**. Many students are taught "Addition before Subtraction" because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS. They do not realize that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be solved left-to-right. 

Therefore, many students will confidently choose **D**, erroneously believing they must do $5+6$ first.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic** (Working at Year 5/6 level)
These students often read left-to-right regardless of operators, or have a very shaky grasp of the priority of multiplication.
*   **A=40% B=15% C=25% D=20%**
*   *Note: High distribution in A because they simply go left-to-right for both.*

**Basic** (Targeting Grade 2/3 at GCSE)
These students know multiplication comes first (Problem Q), but strictly follow the letter ordering of BIDMAS for Problem P.
*   **A=10% B=15% C=5% D=70%**
*   *Note: This is the "high misconception" zone. They get Q right but P wrong.*

**Proficient** (Targeting Grade 5/6 at GCSE - Solid Year 9)
These students understand that Addition/Subtraction are equal priority. They recognize $4-5$ is the correct first step for P.
*   **A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%**
*   *Note: This group usually secures the "B" answer confidently.*

**Advanced** (Targeting Grade 7+ at GCSE)
These students find this trivial and may even spot the "trick" immediately.
*   **A=1% B=98% C=0% D=1%**

### Summary Table

| Category | A | B (Correct) | C | D (Misconception) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 40% | 15% | 25% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 10% | 15% | 5% | 70% |
| **Proficient** | 5% | 85% | 2% | 8% |
| **Advanced** | 1% | 98% | 0% | 1% |

**Teacher's Note:** If I used this in a Year 9 starter, I would expect a "noisy" classroom. Option D is a "Confident Wrong" answer. The most common error in UK schools is treating BIDMAS as a rigid 1-6 hierarchy rather than 4 layers (B -> I -> DM -> AS).
