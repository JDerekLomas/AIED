As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it perfectly captures the intersection of **BIDMAS/order of operations** and the **multiplication of directed numbers**. 

In a Year 9 context, this is a classic "trap" question. Students often feel confident in their ability to substitute, which leads to high "misconception activation" rather than random guessing.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the arithmetic is simple, the conceptual hurdle of $-(3^4)$ vs $(-3)^4$ is a major sticking point even for Higher Tier GCSE students.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to student thinking:**
*   **A (Correct):** Understands that $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$.
*   **B (Linear Error):** Performs $k \times 4$ instead of $k^4$ (very common in lower sets).
*   **C (The Negative Trap):** Either calculates $-(3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3)$ or believes that "if the input is negative, the output must be negative."
*   **D (The "Worst of Both"):** Multiplies the base by the index and retains the negative sign.

#### **Year 9 Sub-groups:**

**Below Basic (Working towards Grade 2)**
*Focus: Multiplication facts and basic substitution. Many will default to multiplication ($3 \times 4$) because powers still feel "foreign."*
*   **A: 15% | B: 40% | C: 15% | D: 30%**

**Basic (Working at Grade 3/4)**
*Focus: Understanding indices but struggling with negatives. The majority will calculate 81 but automatically assume a negative input results in a negative output.*
*   **A: 30% | B: 10% | C: 50% | D: 10%**

**Proficient (Working at Grade 5/6)**
*Focus: These students know $(-3)^2 = 9$. However, under time pressure, many will fail to generalize the "even power = positive" rule and fall for the sign trap.*
*   **A: 65% | B: 5% | C: 25% | D: 5%**

**Advanced (Working at Grade 7+)**
*Focus: Deep understanding of the property of exponents and the effect of even/odd powers.*
*   **A: 95% | B: 0% | C: 5% | D: 0%**

### Teacher's Note:
The "Confident Error" here is almost always **C**. If you were to give this to a Year 9 class, the most common justification for C would be: *"Three to the power of four is 81, and it's a minus because the three was a minus."* This highlights the necessity of teaching brackets during substitution: $T = (-3)^4$.
