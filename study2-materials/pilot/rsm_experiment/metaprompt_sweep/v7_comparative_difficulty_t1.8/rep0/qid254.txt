As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it doesn't test the **process** of division, but rather the **conceptual understanding** of zero and the **order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)**.

In a Year 9 context, this is a classic "trap" question.

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
While calculating a mean is a primary school skill (Level 4/5 in old money), the structural representation here is designed to trigger specific misconceptions. It is significantly harder than a standard calculation because it requires spotting the omission of '0' in the sum versus its inclusion in the count, and the horizontal vs. fraction notation.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Note on Categories:**
*   **Below Basic:** Working at KS2/Level 3-4 (likely to struggle with notation).
*   **Basic:** Target Grade 2/3 (knows the formula but relies on intuition).
*   **Proficient:** Target Grade 4/5 (understands the rules but prone to "scanning" rather than "checking").
*   **Advanced:** Target Grade 6+ (highly attentive to detail).

### Analysis of the "Why"

*   **Option C (The "Ignore Zero" Trap):** The most common mistake for lower-ability students. They see "0" as "nothing," so they exclude it from both the sum and the count of items ($n=4$). This is a very strong misconception.
*   **Option A (The "Hidden Sum" Trap):** This is where most Year 9 students will fall. They correctly identify that $n=5$ because of the zero. They see the sum $1+3+4+7$ and subconsciously add the $0$ themselves (since adding $0$ doesn't change the total). They see a "fraction" which correctly implies the numerator is grouped. **This is actually the correct *numerical* result, but technically lacks the '0' in the written sum.** 
*   **Option B (The BIDMAS Trap):** Some students will choose this because it "looks" like the calculation they type into a non-scientific calculator. However, students who understand BIDMAS will know this actually represents $15 + (7 \div 5)$, not $15 \div 5$.
*   **Option D (The Correct Answer):** This is "None of them" because:
    1.  **A** is numerically correct but arguably incomplete as a "calculation of the mean of the *following* numbers" as it ignores the 0.
    2.  **B** is mathematically incorrect due to the order of operations.
    3.  **C** is fundamentally wrong (dividing by 4).
    *An Advanced student will spot that B lacks brackets and A technically misses a term, leading them to D.*

**Teacher's Verdict:** This question is a "confident wrong" generator. Most Proficient students will click **A** within 5 seconds, thinking they are clever for spotting that the '0' doesn't change the sum, but they will fail to notice that the question is testing the precise mathematical representation.
