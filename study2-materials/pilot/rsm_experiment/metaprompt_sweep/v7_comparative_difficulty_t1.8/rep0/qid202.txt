As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this as a "foundational but deceptive" question. While the arithmetic is simple, it tests **precision** and **literacy** rather than just calculation.

The fact that it is Year 9 is crucial; these students have seen fractions for four years, but their accuracy is often undermined by "stale" rules (like cross-multiplication or adding denominators) or by failing to read the final instruction ("Leave your answer as a mixed number").

### DIFFICULTY: 3/10
For a Year 9 student, the calculation itself is low-difficulty (L2-3). However, because option B is a mathematically correct value (improper fraction) but a functionally incorrect answer to the specific prompt, it acts as a high-quality distractor for stronger students who work too quickly. Option D is the classic "high misconception" choice.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**below_basic (Working at KS2 levels / Below Grade 4 target):**
*These students often default to "add everything they see."*
* **A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%**
* Significant numbers will choose **C** or **D** because they believe denominators must be added ($5+5=10$). Choice C is a common "mush" of adding everything ($2+1+1+2=6$, then somehow getting 18/10 or just guessing).

**basic (Grade 4 target):**
*These students know how to add fractions but are prone to the "adding denominators" misconception if they aren't thinking conceptually.*
* **A=55% B=5% C=5% D=35%**
* This group is most susceptible to **D**. They add the whole numbers (3) and then add the denominators ($5+5=10$), feeling confident because "3 3/10" looks like a "proper" answer.

**proficient (Grade 5/6 target):**
*These students can do the math but are often "speed-runners."*
* **A=75% B=20% C=0% D=5%**
* The main pitfall here isn't the addition; it's **B**. They may convert to improper fractions to solve ($11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$) and stop there, forgetting to convert back to a mixed number as requested.

**advanced (Grade 7+ target):**
*These students read the full prompt and check their work.*
* **A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%**
* The only errors here are due to extreme carelessness or misreading the question as "convert to an improper fraction."

### Teacher's Note on Misconceptions:
*   **The "Confident Wrong" (Option D):** This is the high-activation misconception. Students who choose D aren't guessing; they are applying a logical (but incorrect) rule: "Do to the bottom what you did to the top."
*   **The "Technically Correct" Trap (Option B):** This identifies students who have procedural fluency (improper fractions) but poor exam technique (ignoring the "mixed number" constraint).
