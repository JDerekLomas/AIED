As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it moves away from standard procedural calculation and into **conceptual fluency**. It targets a very specific and pervasive misconception regarding the distributive property of multiplication over equality.

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 student, this is more difficult than it looks. While solving the equation is a "Difficulty 4" task, **evaluating the validity of Tom and Katie’s steps** requires a higher level of metacognition. Most students are taught a specific order of operations (Flowcharts or "DO/UNDO"), and they struggle when that order is challenged or when an operation is applied inconsistently across terms.

### The Misconception Activation
This question has **high misconception activation**.
*   **Tom’s method** is the standard "add 5 to both sides." Most students will recognize this.
*   **Katie’s method** is the "Trap." Many students believe that to "get rid of a fraction," you simply multiply the numerator and the answer by the denominator, forgetting that **every term** in the equation must be multiplied by 3 to maintain equality.

### Predicted Response Distributions

| Student Level | A (Tom) | B (Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 30% | 15% | 40% | 15% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 5% | 45% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 70% | 2% | 25% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 92% | 1% | 5% | 2% |

### Analysis of the Groups:

*   **Below Basic (Working at Year 7 level):** These students often see "doing something to both sides" as a bit of a magic trick. They will likely pick **C** because they recognize the number 36 ($12 \times 3$) and the number 17 ($12 + 5$), assuming that since both numbers "fit," both people must be right.
*   **Basic (Low Year 9):** This is the peak group for the "Both" misconception. They know how to solve it Tom's way, but Katie’s logic looks "mathsy" enough to be plausible. They often fail to realize that if Katie multiplies by 3, the -5 must become -15.
*   **Proficient (Secure GCSE Grade 4/5):** Most will confidently choose **A**. They have been drilled to "add or subtract first," and Katie’s step looks "wrong" to their trained eye. However, about a quarter will still fall into the trap of thinking Katie has just found an "alternative way."
*   **Advanced (Targeting GCSE Grade 7-9):** These students should spot the error immediately. They understand that multiplying by 3 is an operation applied to the entire Left Hand Side: $3(\frac{x}{3} - 5) = 3(12)$, leading to $x - 15 = 36$. They will correctly identify that Katie failed to multiply the constant term.

**Correct Answer: A (Only Tom)**
