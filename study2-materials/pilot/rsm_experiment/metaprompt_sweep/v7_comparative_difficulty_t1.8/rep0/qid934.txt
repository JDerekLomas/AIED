As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it targets a specific "surface-level" understanding of algebra.

While it seems simple, the implicit nature of the equation ($4x + 2y = 10$ rather than $y = 5 - 2x$) and the presentation within a table creates a high **misconception activation** potential. Many students in Year 9 are habituated to seeing $x=0$ and immediately looking for the constant term at the end of the expression, or they get confused by the coefficient of $y$.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
(For Year 9, this is mid-range. It’s easier than solving complex equations, but harder than $y=mx+c$ substitution because they have to "undo" the $2y$.)

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to student logic:**
*   **Answer A (20):** High-misconception. Students multiply $4 \times 5$ or $2 \times 10$ or similar. They see the numbers and perform a random operation.
*   **Answer B (3):** This often happens if they mistakenly substitute $x=1$ instead of $x=0$.
*   **Answer C (5):** **Correct.** $4(0) + 2y = 10 \implies 2y = 10 \implies y = 5$.
*   **Answer D (2.5):** A common "logic error" where students divide 10 by 4, thinking the first coefficient is the primary operator.

#### below_basic (Working at KS3 Stage 3/4)
*Most students in this bracket will see the "10" and either guess or try to involve the "2" and "4" via basic addition/multiplication without considering the equals sign correctly.*
**A=40% B=15% C=20% D=25%**

#### basic (Low Grade 3 / Working toward GCSE)
*Students understand substitution but struggle with two-step equations. Many will see the 10 and 2 and arrive at 5, but a significant number will be "distracted" by the 4 and pick D.*
**A=10% B=10% C=50% D=30%**

#### proficient (Grade 4/5 - "The Standard Pass")
*These students are comfortable with $x=0$. They know the $4x$ term vanishes. The only risk here is a "silly mistake" where they forget to divide by 2.*
**A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%**

#### advanced (Grade 7+ / Top Set)
*High confidence. This is a 10-second question for them.*
**A=0% B=2% C=98% D=0%**

### Teacher's Note:
The "Trap" here isn't the calculation; it's the **$2y$**. In a Year 9 class, about 15-20% of the middle-ability cohort will look at $4x + 2y = 10$, see the $0$, and confidently state that $y$ must be $10$, which isn't even an option (luckily!). If $10$ were option E, it would be the most common wrong answer. Given the choices, they will gravitate toward **5** or **2.5**.
