This is a classic "lure" question that tests a student's ability to identify errors in inverse operations. In a Year 9 context, this falls into the category of a "high misconception" question rather than a "low knowledge" one.

### **DIFFICULTY: 4/10**

**Teacher’s Perspective:**
The difficulty here isn't the algebra itself (Year 9s are usually comfortable with one or two-step equations), but the **cognitive trap** in Step 2. Students see $60$ and $1$, and their brain jumps to $61$ before they check the inverse operation ($60 - 1 = 59$). This is a question where many students will "confidently get it wrong."

### **PREDICTED RESPONSE DISTRIBUTIONS**

**Below Basic** (Working toward Year 7 standards):
*These students often struggle with fractions in equations. They might think multiplying by 4 is wrong to begin with, or guess C because the numbers "look right."*
**A=15% | B=20% | C=50% | D=15%**

**Basic** (Targeting Grade 3/4 at GCSE):
*This is the peak misconception group. They successfully validate Step 1 ($15 \times 4 = 60$), but they see $60, 1, k$ and subconsciously perform $60 + 1$ instead of $60 - 1$. They are very likely to select C.*
**A=25% | B=5% | C=65% | D=5%**

**Proficient** (Targeting Grade 5/6 at GCSE):
*These students are trained to check their work. They will recognize that to isolate $k$, you must subtract 1 from 60. However, a small percentage will still fall for the "visual flow" of Step 2.*
**A=75% | B=5% | C=15% | D=5%**

**Advanced** (Targeting Grade 7-9 at GCSE):
*These students will instantly spot the addition error in Step 2. They may spend a few seconds wondering if it’s a trick question because it seems too simple, but they will ultimately land on A.*
**A=95% | B=1% | C=2% | D=2%**

### **The "Why":**
*   **The Trap:** Step 2 ($61=k$) is designed to exploit **Operation Confusion**. Since the previous step involved multiplication (to clear the fraction), students stay in "increase" mode and add the 1 instead of subtracting it.
*   **The Lure:** Option C is the most common answer for students who do "mental checkmarks." 
    *   Check 1: $15 \times 4$ is 60? Yes. 
    *   Check 2: $60$ and $1$ make 61? Yes. 
    *   Result: "Both are correct."
