To predict these percentages, we must account for the specific ways students at different levels handle algebraic fractions. 

**Common Pitfalls:**
*   **The "Add Across" Error:** Lower-ability students often add the numerators ($3+4=7$) and add the denominators ($2x+x=3x$), leading to option **B**.
*   **Denominator Confusion:** Students who understand they need a common denominator but struggle with algebraic manipulation often forget to multiply the numerator when scaling the fraction. They see the $2x$, keep it, and just add $3+4$ over it, leading to **D**.
*   **The Over-scaling Error:** Some students will multiply both denominators together to get $2x^2$ and then struggle to simplify back down, though this is less common with these specific distractors.
*   **Correct Logic (A):** The common denominator is $2x$. The second fraction $\frac{4}{x}$ becomes $\frac{8}{2x}$. Summing $3+8$ gives $11$.
