As an experienced teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle powers and negatives. At first glance, this looks like a "Level 4/5" (Grade 4) question, but it is notoriously high-error. 

The primary pitfalls here are:
1. **The Sign Error (The "Calculator Effect"):** Many students believe that $-3^4$ is $-81$. Even if using a calculator, if they don't use brackets, the calculator will give $-81$. This trips up even proficient students.
2. **Multiplication vs. Powers:** Basic students frequently multiply the base by the index ($3 \times 4 = 12$ or $-3 \times 4 = -12$).

Here is my prediction of the performance distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=35% D=20%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=8% D=0%
