In my experience as a UK teacher, this question is a classic "sign error" trap. While Step 1 (multiplying by 4) is relatively intuitive for most, Step 2 is the hurdle. Students who struggle with inverse operations often see $+1$ and instinctively think they should "add 1" to the 60 to "get it over to the other side," resulting in 61 instead of subtracting to get 59. 

A significant number of students at the basic and proficient levels will follow this flawed logic, leading them to choose Option C (Both correct), failing to recognise that the final operation in Step 2 was an addition instead of a subtraction.

basic: A=35% B=10% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=4% D=2%
