As an experienced teacher, I have seen students struggle with this specific form of linear equation. When an equation is not in the format $y = mx + c$, students often default to "operational guessing." 

For this specific question, the primary pitfalls are:
1. **$4x$ vs $x=0$ confusion:** Students see $x=0$ and mistakenly think the whole expression equals 10, then divide by 4 or 2 incorrectly.
2. **Ignoring the $2y$:** Many students calculate $4(0) + y = 10$ and look for 10 (which isn't there), or see the 4 and 10 and try to find a number that "fits" the sequence, often choosing D (2.5) because $10 \div 4 = 2.5$.
3. **The "Start" value:** Many students realize that when $x=0$, $2y=10$, leading them to $y=5$. This is the "common sense" route that bridges the gap between basic and proficient.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=35% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=15% C=55% D=25%
proficient: A=2% B=8% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=96% D=2%
