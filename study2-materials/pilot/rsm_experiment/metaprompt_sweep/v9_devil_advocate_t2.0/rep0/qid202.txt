As an experienced teacher, my first instinct is that this is a "level 1" fraction problem. However, looking at the distractors through the lens of common student misconceptions (specifically regarding the denominators and answer formats), the difficulty profile changes.

While "A" is the correct and most straightforward answer, students in the **below_basic** and **basic** tiers frequently fall into the trap of adding the denominators ($5+5=10$), making "D" a very high-frequency wrong answer. Furthermore, even **proficient** students often convert to improper fractions to solve ($\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}$), and many may select "B" because they forget to read the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=10% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=92% B=6% C=1% D=1%
