As a teacher, my initial reaction is that this is a simple "Level 4" notation task. However, looking through the eyes of a student, especially those at basic or below-basic levels, several misconceptions arise:

1.  **Directionality of Division:** A significant number of students believe the "bigger" expression or the second term should go on the bottom, but many instinctively write the second term on top because they read from left to right and assume the first term is the "dividend" but get confused by the spatial arrangement of fractions (Option D).
2.  **Order of Operations (BIDMAS):** Students who are shaky with brackets may try to "solve" or distribute, leading to the "half-fraction" mistake where only the $h$ is under the $c$ (Option C).
3.  **Pattern Matching:** Lower-ability students often look for familiar numbers. If they see a 4 in the question, they might subconsciously feel it needs to appear in both the numerator and denominator to "balance" (Option B).

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=55% B=5% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=5% D=8%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
