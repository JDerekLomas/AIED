To predict student performance on this question, we must identify the specific "traps" laid in the distractors. 

**Option A** is the correct mathematical expression ($15/5 = 3$), as adding $0$ doesn't change the sum but the $0$ *must* be included in the count of $n=5$. However, many students incorrectly believe $0$ "doesn't count."
**Option B** is a classic order of operations (BIDMAS) trap. On a calculator or written linearly, this equals $1+3+4+(7/5)$, not the mean.
**Option C** represents the most common misconception: excluding the zero from the denominator count ($n=4$).
**Option D** is for students who realize Option B is written incorrectly (order of operations) but *also* mistakenly believe that because the "$0$" is missing from the numerator in Option A, it must be wrong too.

**The Reality Check:** Most teachers assume students know to divide by 5. However, the absence of the "$0+$" in the numerator of Option A is a visual "red herring" that makes students reject the correct answer because it "looks" incomplete.
