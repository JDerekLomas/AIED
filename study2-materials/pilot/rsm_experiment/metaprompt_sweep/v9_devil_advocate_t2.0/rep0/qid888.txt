To predict these percentages, I have considered the common pitfalls associated with multiplying binomials (FOIL method) and the specific difficulties UK students have with directed numbers (negatives).

**Common errors accounted for:**
1.  **Sign errors in the constant term:** $-5 \times -7$ is frequently mistaken for $-35$ (negative times a negative).
2.  **Arithmetic of the linear term:** $-5 + -7$ is sometimes mistaken for $-2$ (adding a negative to a negative) or students simply ignore the signs and add them to get $+12$.
3.  **Confusion between C and B:** Many "basic" level students know they add to 12 and multiply to 35 but fail to track the minus signs correctly.

**Student Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Grade 1-2 students. Prone to guess based on digits rather than rules.
*   **Basic:** Grade 3-4 (Foundation Crossover). Likely to remember $5 \times 7 = 35$ and $5+7=12$ but struggle with signs.
*   **Proficient:** Grade 5-6 (Strong Pass). Usually handle the 12 but often make the $+/-$ sign error on the 35.
*   **Advanced:** Grade 7-9. Almost always correct, with rare "slip" errors.

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=65% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
