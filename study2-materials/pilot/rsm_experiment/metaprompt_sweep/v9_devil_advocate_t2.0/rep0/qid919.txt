To predict these percentages accurately, we must consider the specific pitfalls associated with decimal arithmetic and order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

The correct calculation is $y = 3(0.3)^2 = 3(0.09) = 0.27$.

Common student errors include:
1. **Misplacing the decimal in the square:** Many students think $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ (instead of $0.09$), leading to $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$.
2. **Order of operations error:** Doing $(3 \times 0.3)^2$, which is $0.9^2 = 0.81$.
3. **Confusion between squaring and doubling:** Calculating $3 \times (0.3 \times 2) = 1.8$.
