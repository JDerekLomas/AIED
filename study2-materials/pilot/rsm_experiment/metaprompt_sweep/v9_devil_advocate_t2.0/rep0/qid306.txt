In my experience teaching across the UK secondary curriculum, this question identifies a very specific and common misconception regarding "BIDMAS/BODMAS".

The "Addition comes before Subtraction" myth is one of the most persistent errors in British mathematics. Many students take the mnemonic literally, believing they must always add before they subtract, leading them to choose **D** because they prioritize the \(5+6\) in Problem P. For Problem Q, most students are taught that Multiplication precedes Addition, but lower-ability students still tend to work purely left-to-right.

The "Advanced" student recognizes that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and are performed left-to-right (Problem P: \(4-5\)), and that Multiplication comes first in Problem Q.

Here is my prediction of the performance distribution:

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
advanced: A=5% B=85% C=0% D=10%
