Based on my experience teaching GCSE maths, this question is a classic "sign error" trap. While it appears simple (basic multiplication), students frequently struggle with negative numbers and confuse the rules of addition with the rules of multiplication.

**Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the "negative times a negative" rule. They are highly likely to see -1 and -4 and mentally "combine" them to get -5, treating the operation as -1 + (-4) or simply adding the digits and keeping the sign.

**Basic:** These students usually know that $1 \times 4 = 4$. However, many still fail the sign rule, incorrectly believing that a negative and a negative remain negative when multiplied. Some will still add the numbers instead of multiplying.

**Proficient:** These students generally remember that "two negatives make a positive." Their primary error will be "processing noise"—occasionally slipping into addition mode (-5) or making a careless sign error (-4).

**Advanced:** These students have internalized the FOIL/Grid method and the signs involved. They are very unlikely to add the numbers, but a very small minority might still make a momentary slip with a sign.

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=96% B=2% C=1% D=1%
