As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this as a question on **rearranging formulae involving powers and roots**, specifically using the volume of a sphere. 

While the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ is provided on most GCSE formulae sheets, students consistently struggle with "undoing" the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$. Many students incorrectly multiply by 4 and divide by 3, leading to Option A. Others forget that $\pi$ is in the numerator of that fraction, leading them to leave it in the numerator (Option B) or accidentally pull the cube root only over the $V$ (Option D).

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=15% C=65% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
