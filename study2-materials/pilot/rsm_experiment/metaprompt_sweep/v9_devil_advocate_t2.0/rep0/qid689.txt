To accurately predict student performance on this question, we must look past the simplicity of the algebra and identify the common cognitive traps.

Many students at lower ability levels suffer from "commutative confusion" (assuming $10 \div 5$ is the same as $5 \div 10$) or perform "operator attachment," where they see a 10 and a 5 and immediately multiply them to get 50. Even "proficient" students often reflexively calculate $10 \div 5 = 2$ because they are conditioned to see the larger number as the dividend and the smaller as the divisor when solving for a denominator variable.

The correct calculation requires understanding that $10p = 5$, therefore $p = 5/10 = 0.5$.
