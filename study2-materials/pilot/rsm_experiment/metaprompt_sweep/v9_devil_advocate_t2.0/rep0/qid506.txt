In my experience, this specific question is a "trap" for students at almost every level because of the way the brain handles simple fractions and common factors.

Students often see "3" and "12" and instinctively reach for "4" (via $12 \div 3$) without considering the algebraic structure. This makes Option A an incredibly high-frequency distractor for middle-ability students, while Option C attracts those who ignore the fraction entirely.

Here is my prediction based on GCSE performance patterns:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=35% B=55% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=10% B=85% C=2% D=3%

**Teacher’s Reasoning:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many students will see 3 and 12 and perform $12 \div 3 = 4$, then pick C (whole number) or A (fraction). They rarely consider the "divided by 3" step correctly applied to the denominator.
*   **Basic:** This group is the most likely to pick **A**. They know the answer involves "undoing" the 3, and because the question has a fraction, they expect a simple fractional result like 1/4. They essentially perform $1 / (12 \div 3)$ instead of $1 / (12 \times 3)$.
*   **Proficient:** These students recognize they need to divide by 3 (or multiply by 1/3), but a significant portion will still have a "mental slip" and write $p = 1/4$ because the numbers 3 and 12 are so strongly associated with the result 4.
*   **Advanced:** Most will correctly calculate $1/12 \div 3 = 1/36$, but even here, under time pressure, A is a common "silly mistake" due to intuitive number processing.
