To accurately predict student performance on this question, we must look beyond the simple substitution $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$ and consider the common pitfalls:

1.  **The Negative Sign:** The equation $10x - 6y = 30$ contains a subtraction. When students calculate $6 \times 0.5 = 3$, many will inadvertently change the sign to addition when moving it to the other side ($10x = 30 - 3$ instead of $10x = 30 + 3$), leading to $x = 2.7$ (Option D).
2.  **Order of Operations and Rearrangement:** Below-basic students often struggle with multi-step rearrangement. Some may try to "combine" 10 and 6 before substituting, or simply perform $(30 + 0.5) \div 10$ or similar nonsensical operations. 
3.  **Calculation Errors:** $30 + 3 = 33 \rightarrow 33 \div 10 = 3.3$ (Option C). This is the correct path.
4.  **Inverse Misconceptions:** Option A (4.25) and B (-4.25) are "distractor" results that come from reversing the variables (plugging 0.5 in for $x$ and solving for $y$: $5 - 6y = 30 \rightarrow -6y = 25 \rightarrow y \approx -4.16...$). While not mathematically precise to these options, students often gravitate toward the most complex-looking decimal if they feel lost.

The most common wrong answer is D because students are highly prone to "balancing" the equation by subtracting the 3 they just calculated, thinking of the $10x$ and $3$ as a sum rather than seeing the $-6y$ as a subtrahend.
