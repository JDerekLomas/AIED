To accurately predict student performance on this BIDMAS/BODMAS question, we must look at the specific traps. The correct calculation is \(3 - 5 + (4 \times 2) = 3 - 5 + 8 = 6\).

However, many students struggle with the hierarchy of operations involving addition and subtraction. A very common misconception is that "Addition comes before Subtraction" because the 'A' precedes 'S' in BIDMAS. This leads students to calculate \(3 - (5 + 8)\), resulting in \(3 - 13 = -10\). Other students calculate strictly from left to right, ignoring the priority of multiplication, leading to \((3-5+4) \times 2 = 2 \times 2 = 4\). Others still will do the multiplication first, then work left-to-right correctly, but perhaps make a sign error with the negative.

The "Advanced" cohort generally knows that addition and subtraction have equal priority and are performed left-to-right. The "Basic" cohort is most likely to be tripped up by the strict literal interpretation of the BIDMAS acronym.
