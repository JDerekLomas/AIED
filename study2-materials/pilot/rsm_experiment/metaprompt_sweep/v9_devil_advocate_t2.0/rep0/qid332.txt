In my experience, this specific question is a classic "trap" for students across the ability spectrum.

The core difficulty lies in **order of operations in reverse** and the distributive property. Students are taught to "do the same thing to both sides," but they frequently struggle with which operations apply to which terms.

Tom is objectively correct (+5 to both sides). Katie is the source of the common misconception; many students believe they can multiply by 3 to "get rid of the fraction" without realizing they must multiply *every* term (including the -5). Higher-ability students often fall into Katie's trap because they are over-confident with "clearing the denominator" and perform the operation too quickly without writing out the intermediate step of $3(\frac{x}{3} - 5) = 3(12)$.

Here is my prediction of the performance data:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=50% B=15% C=33% D=2%
advanced: A=75% B=5% C=19% D=1%
