To accurately predict student performance on this specific linear equation question, we must look at how students actually interact with variables.

The most common trap here isn't the algebra; it's **visual placement**. Because $x=0$ is at the start of the table, students often associate it with the total value or incorrectly swap $x$ and $y$. Many lower-ability students will see "$10$" and "$2$" and perform a single operation (division) without considering the $x$ term, or they will assume $y = 10 \div 2$ because "zero makes $x$ disappear" but then struggle with the leftover coefficients.

**Option C (5)** is the correct answer.
**Option B (3)** is a common "pattern" guess—students sometimes assume the $y$-row will decrease by $1$ or follow a simple low-integer sequence.
**Option D (2.5)** is the "misunderstanding" result where a student does $10 \div 4$.
**Option A (20)** occurs if a student attempts to multiply $2 \times 10$.

Here is the distribution across ability levels:

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=35% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=50% D=25%
proficient: A=2% B=8% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=96% D=2%
