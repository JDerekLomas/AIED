To predict these percentages, I have considered several key "student logic" pitfalls:
1.  **Additive vs. Multiplicative Reasoning:** A very common error at the lower levels is to see $-1$ and $-4$ and mentally calculate $-1 - 4 = -5$ or $-1 + (-4) = -5$, rather than multiplying.
2.  **Negative Integer Arithmetic:** Students often remember "two minuses make a plus," but apply it inconsistently or doubt themselves under pressure.
3.  **The "Invisible" One:** Some students treat the numbers as isolated digits and ignore the signs entirely, leading them to see "1" and "4" and choose based on basic operations.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=10% D=50%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=5% D=40%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=2% D=18%
advanced: A=96% B=2% C=0% D=2%
