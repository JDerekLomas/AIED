As a UK maths teacher, I have seen hundreds of students approach this specific structure of equation. This is a classic "variable in the denominator" trap. 

Most students see the numbers 10 and 5 and immediately want to perform an operation to get a "nice" whole number. The most common error is calculating $10 \div 5$ (Option C), treating the equation as if it were $p = 10 \div 5$. Another significant portion of students will see the 10 and 5 and assume multiplication is required because "division becomes multiplication" (Option B). 

Option A ($p=0.5$) is the correct answer, but it is counter-intuitive for lower-ability students who believe that "dividing makes a number smaller," and thus cannot see how dividing 5 by something could result in a larger number like 10.

Here is the predicted distribution based on typical GCSE performance:

below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=55% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=28% D=2%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=5% D=0%
