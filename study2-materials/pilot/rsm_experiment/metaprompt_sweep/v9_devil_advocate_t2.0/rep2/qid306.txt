In my experience, teachers often underestimate the "Order of Operations Trap" regarding Addition and Subtraction. Many students follow the acronym BODMAS/BIDMAS (or PEMDAS) so literally that they believe **Addition must always happen before Subtraction**. This makes Problem P significantly harder for middle-ability students than the more "obvious" BIDMAS application in Problem Q.

In Problem P, a huge number of students will prioritize \(5+6\) because "A comes before S," leading them to incorrectly believe the first step is the addition (Option D). In Problem Q, while the priority of multiplication is better understood, low-ability students still tend to work purely from left-to-right (Option A).

basic: A=20% B=25% C=20% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
advanced: A=2% B=88% C=0% D=10%
