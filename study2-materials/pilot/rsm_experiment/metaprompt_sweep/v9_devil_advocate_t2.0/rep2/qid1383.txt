As a UK maths teacher, I have seen many students tackle this specific hurdle. The misconception surrounding the power of a negative number—specifically when processed through a scientific calculator versus mental substitution—is one of the most persistent traps in the GCSE curriculum.

Even strong students can falter here if they type `-3^4` into a calculator without brackets, as the calculator follows BIDMAS and treats it as $-(3^4)$. Meanwhile, weaker students often revert to simple multiplication ($3 \times 4$) or assume the negative sign must be preserved in the final answer because it was in the input.

**below_basic:** (Predicted to struggle with the operation itself, often confusing exponents with multiplication.)
A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%

**basic:** (Likely to perform the power calculation correctly but extremely susceptible to the "sign" error, often believing negative inputs *must* result in negative outputs.)
A=30% B=10% C=50% D=10%

**proficient:** (Generally understand the exponent rule, but a significant portion will fall into the "calculator trap" of typing `-3^4` without brackets.)
A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%

**advanced:** (Most will recognise the even power rule, though a small percentage may still make a careless clerical error under time pressure.)
A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=10% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%
