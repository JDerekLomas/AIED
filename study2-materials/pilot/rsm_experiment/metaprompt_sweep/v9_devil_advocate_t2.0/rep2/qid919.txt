In evaluating this question, a teacher must recognise that $0.3^2$ is one of the most common pitfalls in KS3/KS4 numeracy. Students frequently default to $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ rather than $0.09$. 

Option **A** (0.81) represents students who calculate $(3 \times 0.3)^2$—doing the multiplication before the index, a classic BIDMAS error. 
Option **B** (0.27) is the correct calculation ($3 \times 0.09$).
Option **C** (1.8) is a double-error or "multiplication confusion" where students treat it as $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$. 
Option **D** (2.7) is the "place value" error where students correctly square the 3 to get 9, but think $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, then multiply by 3.

Because "Advanced" students still occasionally fall for the $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ slip under pressure, the proficiency curve is flatter than it initially appears.
