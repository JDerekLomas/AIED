To predict these percentages, I have looked at common student misconceptions regarding linear equations and fractions.

The common pitfall here is the "intuitive division." Many students at lower ability levels see the numbers 3 and 12 and immediately think of the relationship $12 \div 3 = 4$, leading them to **A** or **C**. They often assume the answer must be "cleaner" than $1/36$. 

Even students at the proficient level often struggle with the mechanics of dividing a fraction by an integer. They may mistakenly multiply the numerator (leading to **D**) or invert the wrong side.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=20% B=55% C=10% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%
