To accurately predict student performance on this question, we must look beyond the simple algebraic manipulation. 

Students struggle with this for three main reasons:
1.  **Formula Recall vs. Given Information:** Students often mix up $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ with the surface area formula $4\pi r^2$.
2.  **Fractional Coefficients:** When isolating $r^3$, many students intuitively want to "bring the 4 over and keep it on top" or multiply by the whole fraction rather than its reciprocal.
3.  **Visual Distractors:** Options A and B look "correct" to a student who hasn't carefully rearranged the formula, simply because they contain the $4\pi$ and 3 in various configurations. Option A is a particularly strong distractor for students who don't understand that to isolate $r$, you must divide by $\pi$, not multiply.

Here is the predicted distribution based on typical UK GCSE/A-level cohorts:

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
