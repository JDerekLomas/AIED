To predict the performance on this question, we must look beyond pure arithmetic and consider the psychological pitfalls of fractions and negative signs for UK students (typically Years 8–11).

Many students intuitively know that to get "1", they need the reciprocal ($4/3$). However, the interaction of the two negative signs is a major stumbling block. **Below basic** students often forget that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive; they see a negative answer and assume they need a positive multiplier. **Basic** students often get overwhelmed by "fraction flipping" and may choose C or D simply because the numbers are already present in the question. **Proficient** students understand the reciprocal rule but often "over-correct" their signs.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
