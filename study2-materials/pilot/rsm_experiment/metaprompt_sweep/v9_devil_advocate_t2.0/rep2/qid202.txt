As an experienced teacher, my initial reaction is that this is a "level 1" fraction problem. However, looking through the lens of student misconceptions—particularly regarding denominator operations and question wording—the data usually tells a different story.

**The "Easy" Trap:** Teachers often expect nearly 100% success on this. But students in the "Basic" and "Below Basic" categories frequently apply "whole number logic" to denominators (adding $5+5$ to get $10$). Additionally, while option B is mathematically correct, the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number" acts as a filter; advanced students will follow it, but struggling students might get the correct value as an improper fraction and stop there or choose it because it "looks more mathematical."

Here is the predicted distribution based on typical UK secondary school performance data (Year 7-9):

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=1% D=0%
