To predict these percentages, I have applied the lens of a UK GCSE marker. 

**Teacher’s Reflection:** 
At first glance, this seems like a simple "solve for $k$" problem. However, Step 2 contains a "balancing" trap. Students frequently memorize "do the same to both sides" but falter on inverse operations when the number is already on the RHS. In Step 1, the multiplication by 4 is straightforward. In Step 2, many students see the $1$ and the $60$ and reflexively add them to get $61$ because they forget they must subtract the positive $1$ to isolate $k$.

Below are the predicted percentage distributions:

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
basic: A=25% B=5% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=4% D=2%
