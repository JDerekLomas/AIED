To predict these percentages, we must look beyond the simple arithmetic and identify the most common algebraic misconceptions.

The common mistakes for this specific problem are:
1. **The "Add everything" error (Option B):** Adding numerators $(3+4=7)$ and adding denominators $(2x+x=3x)$. This is the most common error for students who lack confidence with fractions.
2. **The "Ignore the 2" error (Option D):** Adding numerators $(3+4=7)$ but simply picking the "more complex" denominator $(2x)$ or failing to find a common denominator entirely.
3. **The "Multiply the wrong side" error (Option C):** Multiplying the second fraction by 2 but failing to realise the first fraction already has the required denominator, or accidentally doubling the 7.

The correct answer is **A**. To solve it, students must realise the common denominator is $2x$, making the second fraction $\frac{8}{2x}$. Thus, $\frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

**Teacher's Reflection:** Many students see the $x$ and the $2x$ and panic. While it seems like a simple "multiply by 2" task, lower-ability students treat the $x$ as a label rather than a value, leading them to Option B. Proficient students occasionally select D because they perform $3+4$ automatically before considering the denominator.
