As a UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle two-step equations. 

At first glance, this looks like a straightforward check of algebraic manipulation. However, **Katie's mistake is the "classic" misconception** regarding the order of operations in inverse calculations. Students are frequently taught that to "undo" a divide by 3, you must multiply by 3. A student who lacks a deep understanding of the distributive property or the balance method will often multiply the first term and the result, but "forget" (or simply not know) to multiply the $-5$.

Tom's step is the conventional "move the constant first" approach. 
The difficulty here lies in "Katie's" line. Many middle-attaining students see $x - 5 = 36$ as a logical result of multiplying by 3 because they treat the equation like a "function machine" and work backwards in a specific order, but they fail to realise that in Katie's specific line, the $-5$ remains un-multiplied. 

Crucially, **proficient** students often overthink this; they know you *can* multiply by 3 first, and they may glance at Katie’s work and assume she has done it correctly without checking if every term was scaled. **Basic** level students almost exclusively pick C because both lines "look" like standard algebraic moves they have seen before.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=10% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=6% D=2%
