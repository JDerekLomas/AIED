In evaluating this question, a teacher must recognise that while the substitution is "simple," the equation $10x - 6y = 30$ involves three potential pitfalls for students: the presence of a negative sign before the $6y$, the use of a decimal (0.5), and the fact that students are solving for $x$ given $y$ (the inverse of what they usually do).

Many lower-ability students will incorrectly handle the term $-6(0.5)$. Some will add 3 to 30 instead of 30, but many will simply subtract the product from 30 because they see a minus sign. Others will incorrectly rearrange the equation to $x = (30 - 6y) / 10$ before substituting. Option C (3.3) is a very attractive "common sense" distractor: students do $30/10 = 3$ and then "add on" the 0.3 (half of 0.6) or perform $30 + 3$ then divide by 10 but fail with decimal placement. Option D is the result of $10x + 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 27$.

The correct answer is **C (3.3)**: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$.

**Wait, double check:** A=4.25 (Adding 6*2 or other errors), B=-4.25 (Sign error), D=2.7 (Subtracting the 3 instead of adding it). 2.7 is the most common error for mid-tier students.
