As a UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question through the lens of common student misconceptions. 

At first glance, this looks like a straightforward fraction addition. However, the distractions are specifically designed to catch typical errors:
- **Option D (The "Adder" Error):** The most common mistake for lower-ability students is adding the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and then adding the numerators and denominators directly ($7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$).
- **Option A (The "Format" Error):** Students convert correctly to $\frac{99}{20}$ but fail to follow the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
- **Option C (The "Denominator Multiplier"):** Students correctly find the numerator but think the common denominator is found by adding or incorrectly multiplying, leading to $\frac{99}{40}$.

The proficiency gap here lies in whether the student can find the lowest common multiple (20) and whether they remember to re-convert the final improper fraction back into a mixed number.
