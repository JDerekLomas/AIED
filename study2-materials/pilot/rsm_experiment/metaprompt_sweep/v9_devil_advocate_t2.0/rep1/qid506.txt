To predict student performance on this question, we must look at the specific misconceptions surrounding linear equations involving fractions. 

The common error for a student is to "cross-multiply" incorrectly or to misinterpret the division of a fraction. 
- **The "Divide 12 by 3" error:** Students often see the 12 and the 3 and intuitively perform $12 \div 3 = 4$, leading them to $p = 1/4$ or $p = 4$. 
- **The "Operation Confusion":** Many students see the 3 and the 12 and multiply them ($12 \times 3 = 36$), which is the correct step ($1/12 \div 3$ is $1/12 \times 1/3$), but students often stumble into the right calculation for the wrong reasons.
- **Advanced levels:** Should recognise that to isolate $p$, they must divide by 3 (or multiply by $1/3$), giving $1/36$.

**Below Basic:** Often pick A because 12 and 3 suggest the number 4, or C because they struggle with fractions entirely and try to turn the answer into an integer.
**Basic:** Usually split between A and B. They know they need to do "something" with the 3 and the 12. Many will perform $12 \div 3$ out of habit.
**Proficient:** Generally understands the mechanics of $1/12 \div 3$, but under exam pressure, a significant minority will still lapse into the "3 into 12 goes 4" trap.
**Advanced:** High mastery, but rarely 100% due to "silly" speed errors where they mentally treat it as $3/12$.

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=45% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=92% C=1% D=2%
