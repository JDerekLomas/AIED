As a teacher, my initial reaction is that this is a simple "change of subject" or mental arithmetic task. However, experience shows that students struggle when the unknown is the denominator. 

Common pitfalls:
1.  **Multiplication Error (Option B):** Students see 10 and 5 and immediately multiply them ($10 \times 5 = 50$), often assuming the 5 is the denominator.
2.  **Order Error (Option C):** Students do $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$ because they are conditioned to divide the larger number by the smaller number. This is the most common "proficient" error.
3.  **Correct Division (Option A):** Rearranging to $10p = 5$, therefore $p = 5/10$ or $0.5$.

Here is my prediction based on these student misconceptions:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=40% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=25% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=38% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%
