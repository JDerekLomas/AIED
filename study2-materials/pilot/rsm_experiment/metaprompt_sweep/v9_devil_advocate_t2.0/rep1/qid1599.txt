In my experience teaching UK Key Stage 3 and GCSE students, notation questions involving divisions and brackets are classic "surface-level" traps. 

While mathematicians see this as a trivial transcription, many students at lower ability levels do not internalise that the horizontal fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol (effectively replacing the brackets). The "Below Basic" cohort often tries to keep the +4 separate (Option C) because they lack fluency in the "structure" of an algebraic fraction. The most common error for middle-tier students, however, is a directional error (Option D), where they flip the dividend and divisor, often because they start writing the expression with the longer part of the calculation first.

Here is my prediction of the performance distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=55% B=5% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=82% B=2% C=6% D=10%
advanced: A=97% B=1% C=1% D=1%
