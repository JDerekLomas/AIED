To accurately predict student performance on this BIDMAS (order of operations) question, we must look at common misconceptions. 

The correct calculation is $3 - 5 + (4 \times 2) \rightarrow 3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = 6$ (Option A).

However, students often make two critical errors:
1.  **Linear processing (Left to Right):** $(3 - 5) + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$ (Option B). This is the most common mistake for lower-ability students who ignore BIDMAS entirely.
2.  **BIDMAS Misconception (Addition before Subtraction):** Students who remember the acronym "BODMAS" or "BIDMAS" literally often believe Addition **must** happen before Subtraction because A comes before S. They calculate $5 + 8 = 13$, then $3 - 13 = -10$ (Option D). This trips up "proficient" students who know the rules but don't understand the equal priority of addition and subtraction.
3.  **Linear with brackets error:** $3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 \rightarrow 3 - 18 = -15$ (Not listed) or other grouping errors like $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2 \times 2 = 4$.
