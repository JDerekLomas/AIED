As a UK maths teacher, I have seen hundreds of students tackle two-step equations. 

Step 1 is a correct multiplication ($15 \times 4 = 60$). Step 2 is a very common "sign error" mistake. Many students see $60 = 1 + k$ and instinctively add the 1 to the 60 to get 61, rather than subtracting it to isolate $k$. This is because they associate "plus" with "add" regardless of which side of the equation they are moving to, or they simply perform the inverse operation of what they *should* do.

Below Basic students often guess or see that Step 1 "looks right" but fail to check Step 2 properly. Basic students frequently make the error in Step 2 themselves and therefore conclude both steps are correct (Option C). Proficient students recognize Step 1 is correct but have the algebraic discipline to spot the error in Step 2. Advanced students find this trivial but occasionally overthink if there's a "trick."
