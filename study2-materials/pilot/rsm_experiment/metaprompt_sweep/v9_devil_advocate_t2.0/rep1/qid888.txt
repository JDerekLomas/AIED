To accurately predict student performance on this classic quadratic expansion, we must look beyond the simple FOIL/Grid method and consider common cognitive "trip-wires," specifically involving directed numbers (integers).

**A (m² - 2m - 35):** This is a very common error for students who struggle with signs. They often do $-7 + 5$ or confuse the signs while "finding the difference" between 5 and 7 rather than adding two negatives. 

**B (m² - 12m + 35):** The correct answer.

**C (m² + 12m + 35):** This is common among students who see two minus signs and decide "a minus and a minus make a plus" but apply it to the linear term as well as the constant term, or simply ignore the signs when adding 5 and 7.

**D (m² - 12m - 35):** This is the most common high-level mistake. Students correctly calculate $-5 - 7 = -12$, but then incorrectly calculate $-5 \times -7$ as $-35$. The "minus times a minus" rule is famously brittle under exam pressure.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
