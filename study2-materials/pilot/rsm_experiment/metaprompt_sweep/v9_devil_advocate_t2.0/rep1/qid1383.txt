As a UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle powers and directed numbers. The "trap" here isn't the calculation—it's the interplay between the negative base and the even exponent.

While an advanced student knows that a negative number raised to an even power is positive, a basic or "below basic" student often ignores the index rule and performs multiplication ($3 \times 4 = 12$) or correctly identifies the magnitude ($3^4 = 81$) but keeps the negative sign because the input was negative.

Crucially, many students who use a calculator will type $-3^4$ without brackets, which results in $-81$. This leads even "proficient" students to choose C more often than one might expect.

below_basic: A=15% B=40% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=28% D=2%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=5% D=0%
