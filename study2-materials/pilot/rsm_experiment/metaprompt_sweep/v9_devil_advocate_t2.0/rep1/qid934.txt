In predicting student responses to this question, several common misconceptions come into play. Many students, particularly those at lower ability levels, see "x=0" and automatically assume the answer must involve "10 divided by 2" or "10 plus something." However, a significant distractor is Option A ($4+2+10=16$, or mistaking the relationship for addition). 

The most common trap for "basic" students is misidentifying which variable to solve for; they often look at the constant 10 and the coefficient of x, or they simply see $x=0$ and assume $y$ must be half of 10. While $C$ (5) is the correct answer, $D$ (2.5) is a high-frequency distractor for students who confuse $x$ and $y$ or think $10 \div 4 = 2.5$. 

As a teacher, it’s easy to think "they just plug in 0," but students frequently struggle with linear equations in implicit form ($ax+by=c$) compared to $y=mx+c$.
