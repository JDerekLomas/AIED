In my experience teaching this topic in the UK (typically Year 9/10), the most common misconception involves "adding across" (numerators and denominators) or failing to properly scale the numerator when finding a common denominator.

While many teachers assume students will intuitively find the common denominator of $2x$, many lower-ability students struggle with the algebraic nature of $x$ and $2x$, often trying to add the denominators together to get $3x$. The most common error is getting the numerator $7$ ($3+4$) and either keeping the "largest" denominator or adding them.

**Analysis of misconceptions:**
*   **The correct answer (A):** Requires recognizing the common denominator is $2x$, turning $\frac{4}{x}$ into $\frac{8}{2x}$, then adding $3+8=11$.
*   **The "Add everything" trap (B):** $3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$. This is very common for students below basic/basic levels who treat fractions like integers.
*   **The "Half-way" trap (D):** The student sees the $2x$ as the common denominator but forgets to multiply the 4 by 2. $3/2x + 4/2x = 7/2x$. 
*   **The "Missing Denominator" trap (C):** Students get the 11 but ignore the 2 in the $2x$, or think $x$ is the common denominator and lose the coefficient.
