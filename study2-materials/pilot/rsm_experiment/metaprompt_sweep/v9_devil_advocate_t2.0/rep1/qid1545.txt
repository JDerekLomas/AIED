To predict student performance on this question, we must look at how students process the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

Experienced teachers often underestimate the "Lure of the Left." Lower-ability students frequently calculate from left to right regardless of operators. For the left side ($8+12 \div 4$), a significant number of students will calculate $8+12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$. This leads them to conclude that both sides are equal (Option C).

More advanced students recognize the hierarchy of operations on the left side ($12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8+3=11$), while correctly processing the brackets on the right side ($(8+12)=20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$). Since $11 > 5$, the answer is A.

The most common "distractor" is C, caused by ignoring BIDMAS on the left side.
