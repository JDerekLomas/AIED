In evaluating this question, a teacher must recognise that while the substitution $y=3(0.3)^2$ seems straightforward, it contains the "perfect storm" of GCSE common misconceptions: squaring a decimal, the order of operations (BIDMAS), and place value.

**Common Errors:**
*   **B (0.27):** This is the correct answer. Students square $0.3$ to get $0.09$, then multiply by $3$.
*   **A (0.81):** The "bracket" error. Students multiply $3 \times 0.3$ first to get $0.9$, then square it to get $0.81$. This is the most common conceptual error (ignoring BIDMAS).
*   **D (2.7):** The "missing zero" decimal error. Students correctly do $3 \times 3^2$ to get $27$ but struggle with the decimal placement, or they calculate $3 \times 0.3^2$ as $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$.
*   **C (1.8):** The "multiplied by power" error. Students calculate $3 \times 0.3 \times 2$ (treating the squared as a multiplier).

Here is the predicted distribution:

basic: A=45% B=25% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=30% B=55% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=10% B=85% C=2% D=3%
