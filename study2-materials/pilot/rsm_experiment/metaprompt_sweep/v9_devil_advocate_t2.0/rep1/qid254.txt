As a UK maths teacher, I have seen many students tackle the mean of a data set containing zero. At first glance, this looks like a basic "definitions" question, but it contains two massive traps: the role of zero as a value versus its "invisibility" in a sum, and the correct mathematical notation (Order of Operations).

**The Traps:**
1.  **The "Zero Doesn't Count" Trap:** Students at lower ability levels often subconsciously treat zero as "nothing." They might exclude it from the denominator because they think it doesn't change the count of "actual numbers." This makes Option C very attractive.
2.  **The Bidmas Trap:** Option B is a classic "calculator" error. Students write exactly what they would type into a basic calculator if they didn't hit 'equals' before dividing.
3.  **The Mathematical Identity Trap:** Option A is mathematically correct because $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$, and there are 5 values. However, many "Basic" students will hunt for the number '0' in the numerator and, not seeing it, dismiss the option as incomplete.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=55% B=20% C=10% D=15%
advanced: A=85% B=5% C=0% D=10%
