To predict student performance on this question, we must look at the specific algebraic manipulations required to rearrange $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

The primary "traps" here are:
1. **Fractional Division:** Many students struggle with dividing by a fraction. Instead of multiplying by 3 and dividing by 4, they often "carry over" the numbers in the wrong positions (leading to Option B).
2. **Formula Confusion:** Students often misremember the volume of a sphere formula, sometimes confusing it with the surface area ($4\pi r^2$) or the area of a circle, which impacts their trust in the rearrangement.
3. **The Radical Sign:** Some students intuitively pick Option D because they try to "root" the $V$ first before dealing with the coefficients, failing to see that the coefficient must also be inside the cube root.

**Option C is the correct answer.** 

Here is the predicted distribution based on typical UK Key Stage 4 (GCSE) ability profiles:

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=35% D=15%
proficient: A=8% B=15% C=70% D=7%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
