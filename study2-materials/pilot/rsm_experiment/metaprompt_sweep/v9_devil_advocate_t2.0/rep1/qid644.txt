As a UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle bracket expansion. At first glance, this looks like a "gimme" question, but the presence of negative numbers is the single most common stumbling block in Key Stage 3 and 4 algebra.

While a mathematician sees $(-1) \times (-4)$, a struggling student often confuses the **operation** with the **terms**. A common misconception is "combining" the numbers rather than multiplying them, leading to $-5$ or $+5$. Furthermore, even students who know to multiply often forget the "minus times a minus equals a plus" rule.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

**below_basic:** A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
*Critique:* Students at this level frequently revert to addition/subtraction. Seeing $-1$ and $-4$, they are highly likely to pick $-5$ (D).

**basic:** A=45% B=30% C=5% D=20%
*Critique:* These students know they should multiply (eliminating C and D for the most part), but they often struggle with sign rules. Option B is a very high-frequency error here as they simply attach the negative sign they see.

**proficient:** A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%
*Critique:* Most students at this level have mastered the basic sign rules ($1 \times 4 = 4$, and $-\times- = +$), though "silly mistakes" still result in the occasional -4.

**advanced:** A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
*Critique:* High-achievers will find this trivial, but 3-4% will still succumb to a lapse in concentration, likely choosing B if they are working too quickly.
