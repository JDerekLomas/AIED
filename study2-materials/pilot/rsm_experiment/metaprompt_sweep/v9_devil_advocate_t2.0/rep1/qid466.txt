In evaluating this question, a teacher must recognise that while "multiplying by the reciprocal results in 1" is a fundamental rule, the presence of the negative signs is the primary "distractor."

**Below Basic** students often treat fractions as two separate numbers or look for visual symmetry. They frequently forget that "two negatives make a positive" applies to multiplication, or they simply choose the original number (D) because it "looks right" in the equation.
**Basic** students understand the need for a reciprocal to reach the number 1, but they are highly susceptible to the "sign error." They often think: "The answer is negative, so the multiplier must be positive" (A), failing to realise that a negative multiplied by a positive remains negative.
**Proficient** students usually remember both the reciprocal and the sign rule, but under time pressure, a significant minority will still pick A because they intuitively link "negative answer" with "one positive/one negative factor" without checking the original fraction's sign.
**Advanced** students almost always get this correct, as they treat it as a one-step algebraic equation or understand the multiplicative inverse of -3/4.
