As a UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common classroom misconceptions regarding fractions. 

At first glance, this seems like a standard calculation. However, the common errors are highly predictable: 
1. **The "Add Across" Error (Option D):** Weak students frequently add the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$), then add the whole numbers.
2. **The Improper Fraction Distractor (Option A):** Students often convert correctly to common denominators but fail to read the instruction to leave the answer as a **mixed number**. $\frac{99}{20}$ is mathematically equal but does not meet the rubric.
3. **The Common Denominator Error (Option C):** Multiplying the denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but failing to adjust the numerators correctly or getting confused by the large denominator.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=25% D=45%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
