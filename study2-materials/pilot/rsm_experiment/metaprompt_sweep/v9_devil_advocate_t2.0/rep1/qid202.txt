In my experience teaching UK Key Stage 3 and GCSE students, this question appears deceptively simple to an expert but contains classic "fraction traps." 

The main distractor is Option D ($3 \frac{3}{10}$), which captures students who instinctively add denominators when adding fractions. Option B ($\frac{18}{5}$) is a mathematically correct improper fraction, but because the question explicitly asks for a "mixed number," students who are proficient but forget to read the final instruction may lose marks or hesitate.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=10% C=30% D=35%
*At this level, "adding across" the bottom is a very high-frequency error. Many will also be confused by the mixed numbers and simply add all the digits ($2+1+1+2+5+5$) or choose C because it has a 10 on the bottom.*

basic: A=50% B=15% C=5% D=30%
*These students are learning the rules but often default to the "add everything" trap (D) when they are tired or rushing. Some will convert to improper fractions first and leave it as B, failing to read the requirement for a mixed number.*

proficient: A=80% B=10% C=0% D=10%
*Most proficient students follow the routine of adding the integers and fractions separately. The errors here are almost exclusively from misreading the instruction "as a mixed number" (choosing B) or a lapse in concentration (choosing D).*

advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
*High-ability students find the calculation trivial. The only risk is a "speed error" where they correctly calculate the value but click B because it is the first numerically equivalent value they see.*
