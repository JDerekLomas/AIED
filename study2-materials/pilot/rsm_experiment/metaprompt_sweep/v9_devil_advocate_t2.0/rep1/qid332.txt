In my experience as a teacher, this specific multi-step equation trips up many students due to the "order of operations in reverse" (BIDMAS/BODMAS) required for solving.

Tom follows the conventional approach of adding 5 to both sides first, which most students are taught as the standard "next step." Katie, however, represents a classic misconception. Students who struggle with algebraic structure often know they need to "multiply by the denominator" to "get rid of the fraction," but they frequently forget to multiply every term in the equation (the -5 as well as the 12). 

Low-ability students will often see Katie's $x-5=36$ and think, "Yes, $12 \times 3$ is $36$, so she must be right," failing to see that the 5 wasn't multiplied. High-ability students will recognise that Katie has failed to distribute the multiplication across the entire left-hand side.
