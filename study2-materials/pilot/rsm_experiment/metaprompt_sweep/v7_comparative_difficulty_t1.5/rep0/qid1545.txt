As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It is a classic "trap" question that targets **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)**.

In a Year 9 context, this isn't difficult because the arithmetic is hard; it's difficult because it triggers a strong **left-to-right processing bias**, which is a high-activation misconception. Students often feel "confident" while performing the wrong operations.

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**
(It scores a 6 because while the calculation is Primary-level, the structural trap is very effective even for 13-14 year olds.)

### **The Mechanics of the Trap**
*   **Left Side ($8 + 12 \div 4$):** The common error is $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$. The correct BIDMAS path is $12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8 + 3 = \mathbf{11}$.
*   **Right Side ($(8 + 12) \div 4$):** Brackets force the addition first. $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.
*   **The Conflict:** Students who ignore BIDMAS on the left will see $5 \square 5$ and confidently choose **C (=)**.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

#### **Below Basic (Working below Grade 3)**
*These students often lack a systematic approach and will likely add first on both sides, or guess based on the numbers "looking" the same.*
*   **A (>):** 10%
*   **B (<):** 10%
*   **C (=):** 75% (Confident misconception)
*   **D (≥):** 5%

#### **Basic (Working at Grade 3/4)**
*These students have heard of BIDMAS but apply it inconsistently. The visual similarity of the numbers on both sides strongly pulls them toward the "=" sign.*
*   **A (>):** 25% (Calculated correctly)
*   **B (<):** 5%
*   **C (=):** 65% (The "they look equal" trap)
*   **D (≥):** 5%

#### **Proficient (Working at Grade 5/6)**
*These students usually pause to calculate. Many will catch the BIDMAS rule on the left, though under time pressure, a significant minority will still fall for the visual "symmetry" of the expressions.*
*   **A (>):** 70% (11 > 5)
*   **B (<):** 5%
*   **C (=):** 20%
*   **D (≥):** 5%

#### **Advanced (Working at Grade 7+)**
*These students immediately identify the brackets as the "distinguisher" and verify the order of operations without prompting.*
*   **A (>):** 95%
*   **B (<):** 1%
*   **C (=):** 2%
*   **D (≥):** 2%

### **Teacher’s Insight:**
This is a high **"Confident Error"** question. If you gave this to a Year 9 class, you would see a lot of hands go up instantly for option C. It is an excellent "diagnostic" question to use at the start of a lesson to prove to students that they still need to be careful with "easy" numbers.
