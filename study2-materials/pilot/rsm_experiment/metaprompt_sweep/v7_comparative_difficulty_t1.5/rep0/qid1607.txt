This is a classic "lure" question that tests a student's ability to identify errors in inverse operations. It specifically targets the common misconception surrounding the transition from a multi-step equation to a final solution.

### Difficulty Rating: 4/10
For a Year 9 student, the algebra itself is "Basic" (Level 4/5 in GCSE terms). However, because the error in Step 2 is a very common "action" students perform themselves, they often fail to spot it when checking someone else's work. It has a high **misconception activation** rather than being "hard" in terms of cognitive load.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**The Misconception:** In Step 2, students see $+1$ and instinctively want to add $1$ to the $60$ to "get rid of it," forgetting that the inverse of addition is subtraction.

| Cohort | A (Correct) | B (Incorrect) | C (Incorrect) | D (Incorrect) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 10% | **65%** | 10% |
| **Basic** | **45%** | 5% | 40% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | **80%** | 2% | 15% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | **98%** | 0% | 2% | 0% |

#### Teacher’s Analysis:

*   **Below Basic (Low Prior Attainment):** These students often suffer from "Completion Bias." They see Step 1 is correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$) and, because they frequently make the addition error in Step 2 themselves, they lack the "internal alarm" to spot Isaac’s mistake. Option **C** will be the most popular choice here.
*   **Basic (Grade 3/4 Boundary):** These students are the most split. They will correctly verify Step 1. Many will pause at Step 2; some will realise $60-1=59$, but a significant portion will fall into the "confidently wrong" trap, assuming Isaac must be right because his numbers look "clean."
*   **Proficient (Grade 5/6):** Most will identify the error in Step 2 quickly. If they get it wrong, it’s usually due to rushing and not reading the word "only" in the options, or simply confirming Step 1 and assuming the rest follows.
*   **Advanced (Grade 7+):** These students should find this trivial. They are likely to mentally solve the equation themselves ($k=59$) before even looking at Isaac’s steps, making the error in Step 2 glaringly obvious.
