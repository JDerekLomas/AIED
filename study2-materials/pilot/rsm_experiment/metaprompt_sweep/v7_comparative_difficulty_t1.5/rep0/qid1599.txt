As an experienced UK maths teacher, I would categorize this as a **conceptual notation** question. In the Year 9 curriculum (Key Stage 3), students are transitioning from "arithmetic thinking" to "algebraic fluency."

The difficulty here isn't the calculation (there is none), but the structural understanding of how division bars act as grouping symbols (implicit brackets).

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
While the concept is taught in Year 7, many Year 9 students still struggle with the "visual hierarchy" of fractions. It is a 4 because while it's "simple," it targets a very common foundational weakness regarding the order of operations in fractions.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working towards GCSE Grade 1-2):**
These students often focus on the symbols in isolation rather than the structure. They are highly susceptible to "distractor C" because they see the $+4$ and assume it stays "separate" from the division, or "distractor D" because they confuse which term is the divisor.
*   **A=40% B=10% C=25% D=25%**

**Basic (Working towards GCSE Grade 3-4):**
These students have been told "division is a fraction," but they are "confidently wrong" when it comes to the position of terms. They often get the numerator and denominator swapped (Option D) because they read left-to-right but map it incorrectly to top-to-bottom.
*   **A=65% B=5% C=10% D=20%**

**Proficient (Working towards GCSE Grade 5-6):**
Most students at this level understand that the division bar replaces the $\div$ symbol and that everything following the symbol must go in the denominator. They have mostly ironed out the "swap" error.
*   **A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%**

**Advanced (Working towards GCSE Grade 7-9):**
For these students, this is a "level 1" difficulty question. They recognize algebraic conventions instantly as a language.
*   **A=99% B=0% C=0% D=1%**

### Teacher's Insights:
*   **The "D" Trap:** The most common "confident" error is D. Students often internalize that "the big/long part goes on the bottom," but in a rush, they simply swap them.
*   **The "C" Trap (The Misconception):** Students who choose C fail to realize that the brackets in $c \div (h+4)$ force the $(h+4)$ to be treated as a single entity. If the brackets were removed ($c \div h + 4$), C would be correct. This question perfectly tests if they understand that a fraction bar acts as a **grouping symbol**.
*   **Option B** is a "nonsense" distractor, usually only chosen by students who are clicking at random or have a profound misunderstanding of variables.
