This is a classic "trap" question that tests two distinct conceptual areas: **multiplicative inverses (reciprocals)** and **directed number rules (signs)**.

In my experience with Year 9 (ages 13–14), this is a high-misconception question rather than a random-guess question. Students often perform a "half-fix"—they know they need to flip the fraction but forget the sign, or they focus so much on making the answer "1" that they lose track of the negative sign required to cancel out the existing one.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the arithmetic is simple, the "cognitive load" of managing both the fraction flip and the double-negative logic simultaneously makes it challenging for a typical Year 9 student.

**Note on tiers:**
*   **Below Basic:** Working at KS2/low KS3 level (Level 3-4 equivalent).
*   **Basic:** Fluency with basic fractions but struggles with negatives.
*   **Proficient:** Understands reciprocals and negative rules in isolation.
*   **Advanced:** Mastery of algebraic manipulation and identity elements.

### Teacher's Commentary on the "Why":

*   **The Option A Trap (The "High Misconception"):** This will be the most common wrong answer. Basic/Proficient students know the reciprocal of $3/4$ is $4/3$ to get to a magnitude of $1$. However, their brain "stops" once they find the reciprocal. They see a negative in the question and a negative in the answer, and intuitively feel that the missing number should be positive. They overlook that $(-)\times(+) = (-)$.
*   **Option C (The "Reflector"):** Below Basic students often treat the equals sign like a mirror or an addition problem. They see $-3/4$ and want to "cancel it out" with a positive version of itself, confusing the rules of additive inverses (which would sum to $0$) with multiplicative inverses.
*   **Option D (The "Panic"):** Students who are overwhelmed by fractions often pick the number they already see, hoping there is some identity property they've forgotten.
*   **Option B (The Correct Answer):** Requires the student to hold two thoughts at once: "I need to flip it to get 1" AND "I need it to be positive $4/3$ for the result to stay negative... wait, no, $(-)\times(+)$ is $(-)$, so it must stay $4/3$." The common error is thinking two negatives make a positive; because the target is $-1$, they must realize they only need *one* negative sign in the product.
