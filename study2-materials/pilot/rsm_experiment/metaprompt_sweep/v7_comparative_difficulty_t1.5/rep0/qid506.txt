As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. On the surface, it’s a one-step linear equation. However, because it involves a unit fraction, it acts as a "wolf in sheep's clothing."

In a Year 9 context, this is a classic **"high misconception"** problem. Students don't guess randomly; they confidently apply a process they have misunderstood.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the algebra is "Level 3/4," the fractional arithmetic moves it up. For a Year 9 student, "dividing by 3" and "12" triggers a Pavlovian response to reach for the number 4, making this significantly harder than a standard equation like $3p = 15$.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**The Distractors:**
*   **A ($p = 1/4$):** The "Intuitive Error." Students see 3 and 12 and perform $12 \div 3$, keeping it as a fraction. They ignore the positional logic of the division.
*   **C ($p = 4$):** The "Integer Bias." Students ignore the fraction entirely and solve $12 \div 3$.
*   **D ($p = 1/9$):** A procedural error where students perhaps try to multiply by 3 but do it to the denominator of a $1/3$ they've imagined.

| Group | A | B (Correct) | C | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 40% | 10% | 40% | 10% |
| **Basic** | 55% | 20% | 15% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 25% | 60% | 5% | 10% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | 92% | 1% | 2% |

### Teacher’s Analysis:

1.  **Below Basic (Working at Year 7 level):** These students struggle with the reciprocal nature of the equation. They see the numbers 3 and 12 and simply hunt for a relationship. Option C is very attractive because it results in a "nice" whole number.
2.  **Basic (Targeting Grade 3/4 GCSE):** This is the **danger zone** for Option A. These students know they need to divide by 3. They perform $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$ but mentally process it as "What is a third of 12?" or simply divide the denominator by the coefficient because "12 divided by 3 is 4." They will be very confident in this incorrect answer.
3.  **Proficient (Targeting Grade 5/6 GCSE):** Most students here will successfully navigate the operation. They will either write it as $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$ or understand that the denominator must get larger ($12 \times 3$) because they are splitting a small piece into three even smaller pieces.
4.  **Advanced (Targeting Grade 7+ GCSE):** These students see the answer almost instantly. The only errors here would be "finger slips" or extreme rushing.

**Summary:** Expect Option A to be the "most popular wrong answer." It feels right to a student who has a surface-level grasp of inverse operations but weak fractional fluency.
