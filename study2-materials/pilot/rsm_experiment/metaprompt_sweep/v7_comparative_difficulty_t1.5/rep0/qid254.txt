As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it isn’t testing calculation—it is testing **conceptual precision** and **mathematical literacy**.

While "calculating a mean" is usually a difficulty 3 or 4, this specific question is a "trap" question. It targets two of the most common hurdles in KS3 maths: the role of zero in data sets and the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS).

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
For a Year 9 student, the arithmetic is trivial, but the distractors are psychologically "loud." Most students will instinctively look for the "sum divided by count" structure and fall into one of the built-in pitfalls before they realize the correct mathematical notation is absent.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to categories:**
*   **Below Basic:** Working below age-related expectations (Level 3/4 equivalent).
*   **Basic:** Target Grade 3-4; understands the "average" means adding and dividing.
*   **Proficient:** Target Grade 5-6; understands BIDMAS and inclusive data.
*   **Advanced:** Target Grade 7-9; precise mathematical logic.

| Category | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 30% | 20% | 45% | 5% |
| **Basic** | 55% | 25% | 10% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 40% | 15% | 5% | 40% |
| **Advanced** | 10% | 5% | 0% | 85% |

### Teacher’s Analysis of the Errors

*   **Option A (The "Zero doesn't count" Trap):** This is the most popular answer for the "Basic/Proficient" middle-ground. Students know they need to divide by 5 because there are five numbers, but they subconsciously believe that adding $0$ is "doing nothing," so they find the expression $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ mathematically synonymous with the correct method. They overlook that the expression $0+1+3+4+7$ is the formal numerator.
*   **Option B (The BIDMAS Trap):** Students who think in "calculator speak" often choose this. If you type $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$ into a scientific calculator, it will follow the order of operations and only divide the 7 by 5. Many Year 9s still struggle to translate "Divide the whole lot by 5" into a written linear expression using brackets.
*   **Option C (The "Ignore Zero" Trap):** Students who believe $0$ isn't a "real" piece of data will add the non-zero digits and divide by 4. This is a common misconception in the lower sets (Below Basic).
*   **Option D (The Correct Answer):** This requires the student to be "brave." To select D, a student must recognize that:
    1.  A is technically incorrect (missing the term $+0$, though it doesn't change the sum).
    2.  B is mathematically incorrect due to BIDMAS.
    3.  C is statistically incorrect.
    
    *Note: In some UK exam boards (like AQA or Edexcel), Option A might be argued as acceptable because $0+x=x$, but in a rigorous classroom setting, we use this to highlight that $0$ is an observation that must be represented.*
