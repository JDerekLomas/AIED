As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it perfectly illustrates the gap between **procedural fluency** and **conceptual understanding** of fractions and division.

For a Year 9 student (age 13-14), this is a "trap" question. Students are conditioned to look at the numbers 10 and 5 and immediately think of the relationship $10 \div 5 = 2$.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the arithmetic is simple, the algebraic structure (where the unknown is the denominator) is a major hurdle. In a typical Year 9 class, many students will confidently perform the wrong operation.

### Pedagogical Analysis

**1. The "High Misconception" Trap (Choice C: $p=2$)**
This will be the most common answer for Below Basic and Basic students. They see $10$, $5$, and $p$. Their brain subconsciously rearranges the equation to a familiar format ($10 \div 5 = p$ or $5 \times p = 10$). This is a "confident wrong answer"—students won't guess; they will calculate $2$ and be certain they are correct.

**2. The Reverse Error (Choice B: $p=50$)**
Students who remember that they need to "multiply" to move something from the bottom of a fraction often multiply the wrong side. They do $10 \times 5 = 50$, mistakenly thinking $p = 10 \times 5$ instead of $5 = 10 \times p$.

**3. The Threshold to Proficiency (Choice A: $p=0.5$)**
A "Proficient" student recognizes that $10 = 5 \div p$ means that $p$ must be smaller than 1, because 10 is larger than 5. They either algebraically rearrange ($10p = 5 \rightarrow p = 5/10$) or use logic ($5$ halved is $10$?). Interestingly, even proficient students often pause here because they dislike results that are decimals/fractions.

**4. The "Unsure" Factor**
Unlike "2 + 3", this question creates cognitive dissonance. In a Year 9 class, if you asked this at the start of a lesson, you would see a lot of hands go up for **C**, followed by a "Wait... no..." from the top 10% of the class. It is a classic formative assessment tool used to teach the "cross-multiplication" or "reciprocal" method.
