This is a staple GCSE foundation and higher tier topic. For a Year 9 class, this represents a "threshold" skill—one that many are currently mastering but where sign errors remain the primary pitfall.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
While the algebra itself is straightforward (FOIL/Grid method), the "double negative" makes this a high-misconception question. Students often "confidently get it wrong" because they remember to add/multiply the numbers but fail the integer arithmetic.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working towards Grade 2)**
*These students struggle with the structure of expansion. They often focus on the numbers but ignore the signs entirely, or mistakenly "simplify" $-5-7$ as $-2$.*
* **A=40% B=20% C=25% D=15%**
* *Rationale:* Option A is a massive distractor for students who calculate $-7 + 5$ or $7 - 5$ instead of $-5 - 7$.

**Basic (Working towards Grade 3/4)**
*These students know the "FOIL" or "Grid" method but are highly prone to the negative $\times$ negative error. Many believe a negative and a negative always make a negative, regardless of the operation.*
* **A=25% B=35% C=15% D=25%**
* *Rationale:* D is the most common "confident mistake" here; they correctly calculate $-12m$ but conclude that $-5 \times -7 = -35$.

**Proficient (Working towards Grade 5/6)**
*These students have automated the process and usually handle the linear term ($-12m$) correctly. Their only likely slip is a momentary lapse in sign rules for the constant term.*
* **A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%**
* *Rationale:* Most will get it right. Option D remains the primary "silly mistake" if they are rushing.

**Advanced (Working towards Grade 7+)**
*These students see the pattern instantly and treat it as a "10-second" question.*
* **A=1% B=98% C=0% D=1%**
* *Rationale:* Errors are negligible and usually down to misreading the question.

### Teacher's Note: The "Confidently Wrong" Factor
The most dangerous distractor is **D**. In my experience, a significant number of Year 9s will show the working $-5 \times -7$ and write $-35$ because they are mentally exhausted by the effort of calculating the $-12m$ and "default" back to a single negative sign. Option **A** is the "Guessers Choice" for those who haven't mastered the distributive property and just find any combination of 5 and 7 that looks familiar.
