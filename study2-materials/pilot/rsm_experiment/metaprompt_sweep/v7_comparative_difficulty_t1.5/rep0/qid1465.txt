This is a classic "trapped" order of operations question. While the calculations themselves are Year 4/5 level, the cognitive conflict between BIDMAS/BODMAS rules and the physical layout of the numbers makes it a recurring hurdle for Year 9 students.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
For a Year 9 student, the challenge isn't the arithmetic; it's the **priority of operations**. This falls at a 4 because while "order of operations" is a foundational topic, the specific inclusion of a subtraction *before* an addition of the same priority level is the most common pitfall in secondary school numeracy.

### Analysis of Misconceptions
*   **The Left-to-Right Error:** $(3 - 5) + 8 = 6$ (Correct).
*   **The "Addition Before Subtraction" Error (The BIDMAS Trap):** Students see "A" before "S" in the acronym and force it: $5 + (4 \times 2) = 13$, then $3 - 13 = -10$.
*   **The Linear Multiplication Error:** $(3 - 5 + 4) \times 2 = 4$.
*   **The Total Chaos Error:** $(3 - (5 + 4)) \times 2 = -12$.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working at KS2 levels)**
These students often ignore order of operations entirely or read the acronym strictly (Addition always before Subtraction), leading them to Option D.
*   **A (6): 20%** | **B (4): 25%** | **C (10%):** | **D (-10): 45%**

**Basic (Working at Grade 1-2 GCSE level)**
This group knows they must multiply first but is highly susceptible to the "Addition must come before Subtraction" myth. This is the peak of "confident but wrong."
*   **A (6): 35%** | **B (4): 10%** | **C (5%):** | **D (-10): 50%**

**Proficient (Working at Grade 4-5 GCSE level)**
These students have been corrected on the "Addition/Subtraction have equal priority" rule. Most will calculate correctly from left to right after the multiplication.
*   **A (6): 75%** | **B (4): 5%** | **C (5%):** | **D (-10): 15%**

**Advanced (Working at Grade 7+ GCSE level)**
These students see the structure instantly. The only errors here would be "finger slips" or over-thinking a simple problem.
*   **A (6): 96%** | **B (1%):** | **C (1%):** | **D (-10): 2%**

### Teacher's Note:
Option **D** is the strongest distractor. In a typical Year 9 classroom, you will see a heated debate between the students who got **6** and those who got **-10**. The students who got **-10** will argue the most passionately because they are "following the letters of BIDMAS," not realizing that Addition and Subtraction are a tied pair handled left-to-right.
