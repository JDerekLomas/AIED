As a UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because it touches on **implicit linear equations**, which Year 9s often find much more intimidating than the standard $y = mx + c$ format.

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 student (age 13-14), this is a "Goldilocks" question. It isn't mechanically complex, but it contains a high **"misconception activation"** profile. 

**The Hurdles:**
1.  **Implicit Form:** Most students are trained to substitute $x$ and calculate. Here, they must substitute $x=0$ and then solve a mini-equation ($2y=10$).
2.  **The "$4x$" Distractor:** Lower-ability students often see the $4x$ and $10$ and immediately try to combine them (leading to $14$ or $6$) or simply ignore the $2y$.
3.  **Coefficient Confusion:** Some will substitute $x=0$ correctly but then divide $10$ by $4$ instead of $2$ because the $4$ is the first coefficient they see.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to groups:**
*   **Below Basic:** Struggling with basic substitution and the concept of an equation.
*   **Basic:** Can substitute into $y=mx+c$ but struggles when $y$ has a coefficient.
*   **Proficient:** Working at "Expected Standard." Comfortable with one-step/two-step equations.
*   **Advanced:** Fluently rearranges equations or mentalises the substitution.

| Group | A (20) | B (3) | C (5) | D (2.5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 40% | 10% | 30% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 15% | 15% | 45% | 25% |
| **Proficient** | 5% | 5% | 80% | 10% |
| **Advanced** | 0% | 2% | 98% | 0% |

### Analysis of the Options:
*   **A (20):** **The "Operation Confusion" Trap.** Students see $4$, $x=0$, $2$, and $10$. They might think they need to do $10 \times 2$. Common among students who panic at algebraic notation.
*   **B (3):** **The Guess.** Students who don't know where to start often pick a number that "looks" like it belongs in a pattern with the other small integers.
*   **C (5):** **The Correct Answer.** $4(0) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 10 \rightarrow y = 5$.
*   **D (2.5):** **The Coefficient Trap.** The student correctly identifies that $x=0$ eliminates the $4x$, but then they divide $10$ by the *wrong* coefficient ($10 \div 4 = 2.5$). This is a high-level distractor for students who understand the process but have poor "attention to precision."

**Teacher's Verdict:** You will see a lot of "C" from students who have been taught "cover-up" methods for finding intercepts, but a surprising amount of "D" from mid-range students who rush.
