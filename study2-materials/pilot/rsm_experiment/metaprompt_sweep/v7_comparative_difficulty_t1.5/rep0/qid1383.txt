As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it is a "wolf in sheep’s clothing." While it appears to be a simple substitution task, it deliberately targets two of the most prevalent misconceptions in Key Stage 3: index laws versus multiplication, and the behavior of negative bases with even exponents.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 student, this is harder than it looks. It doesn't require complex multi-step procedures (like completing the square), but it requires a high level of "precision discipline." In a classroom setting, many students will rush this, confidently falling into the traps laid by distractors B and C.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to Distractors:**
*   **A (Correct):** Correct application of $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$.
*   **B (Misconception - Multiplication):** Student multiplies the base by the index ($3 \times 4$).
*   **C (Misconception - Sign):** Student calculates $3^4$ but assumes a negative base always stays negative, or types $-3^4$ into a basic calculator without brackets.
*   **D (Double Misconception):** Multiplies base by index and keeps the negative sign.

| Student Level | A (81) | B (12) | C (-81) | D (-12) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 40% | 15% | 35% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 20% | 45% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 60% | 5% | 30% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 95% | 0% | 5% | 0% |

### Analysis of the Distribution

*   **Below Basic (Working at Year 7 level):** These students often view index notation as a prompt to multiply the big number by the small number. They will split heavily between **B** and **D**, often choosing **D** because "the question has a minus sign, so the answer must have a minus sign."
*   **Basic (Working at Year 8/low Year 9 level):** This group is the "danger zone" for high-confidence errors. They know that $3^4$ involves repeated multiplication (getting to 81), but they have a deeply held misconception that "a negative number to a power stays negative." They will gravitate toward **C** in large numbers.
*   **Proficient (Secure Year 9):** These students are likely to remember that a negative multiplied by a negative is a positive. However, even here, **C** remains a significant distractor due to "calculator syntax error" logic (the belief that $-3^4$ and $(-3)^4$ are the same thing).
*   **Advanced (Targeting Grade 7-9 at GCSE):** These students have been "bitten" by this trick before in mocks or starters. They will consciously write out $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$ or use brackets mentally to ensure the positive result.
