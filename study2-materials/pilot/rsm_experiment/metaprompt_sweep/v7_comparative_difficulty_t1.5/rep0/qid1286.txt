This is a classic "subject-rearrangement" task embedded within a geometry context. For a Year 9 student, this is significantly more challenging than it looks because it requires three distinct steps: recalling (or identifying) a complex formula, inverse operations involving fractions, and handling the cubic power.

### DIFFICULTY: 8/10
While "completing the square" (the 10/10 benchmark) is conceptually denser, this question is high-difficulty because it is **abstract**. There are no numbers to work with, and the distractors are specifically designed to catch common algebraic slips (like multiplying by the numerator instead of the denominator).

### PREDICTED RESPONSE DISTRIBUTIONS

I have categorized the groups based on typical UK Year 9 attainment (Key Stage 3).

| Category | A | B | C (Correct) | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 40% | 25% | 15% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 30% | 25% | 25% | 20% |
| **Proficient** | 15% | 10% | 65% | 10% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 3% | 95% | 0% |

### ANALYSIS OF MISTAKES

**The "High Misconception" factor:**
This is a high-misconception question rather than a random-guess question. 

1.  **Distractor A (The Multiplier):** This is the "Confident Incorrect" leader for Below Basic/Basic students. Many students see $V$ and the elements of the sphere formula ($\pi, 4, 3$) and simply "mash" them together. They see the $\frac{4}{3}$ in the original formula and assume the $4$ stays on top when moving across the equals sign.
2.  **Distractor B (The $\pi$ slip):** This attracts students who understand they need to divide by $\pi$ but fail the "keep-change-flip" logic of dividing by a fraction ($\frac{4}{3}$).
3.  **Distractor D (The Cube Root error):** This attracts students who think the cube root only applies to the $V$ (perhaps confusing it with $r = \sqrt[3]{V}$ for a cube) and try to treat the constants as coefficients to be moved later.

**The "Proficient" Jump:**
Students at the "Proficient" level (working at a strong Grade 5/6 GCSE level early) generally succeed here because they have been taught to multiply by the denominator first:
1. $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$
2. $3V = 4\pi r^3$
3. $\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$

**The "Below Basic" struggle:**
In many Year 9 classrooms, the "Below Basic" group hasn't yet mastered the sphere volume formula. If they don't have the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ in front of them, they will guess randomly based on which option "looks" most like a maths formula, usually favoring **A** or **B**.
