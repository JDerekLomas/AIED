As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in Year 9 assessments. It is a "diagnostic" style question designed to catch students who understand the *procedure* of expanding (FOIL/Grid) but lack the *fluency* in directed numbers (integers).

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
For a typical Year 9 student, this is "Low Difficulty, High Danger." It doesn’t require the algebraic complexity of completing the square, but it triggers several high-frequency misconceptions regarding signs and operations.

### Analysis of Misconceptions
*   **The "Add instead of Multiply" error:** Students see $-1$ and $-4$ and their brain performs addition $(-1) + (-4) = -5$, rather than multiplication.
*   **The "Double Negative" error:** Students know $1 \times 4 = 4$, but forget that two negatives make a positive, choosing $-4$.
*   **The "Sign Blindness" error:** Students ignore the signs entirely, see $1 + 4$, and choose $+5$.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic:** 
*Working at KS2 levels/Low Year 7 level.* These students often confuse operations. They see the numbers and the gaps between them and default to addition/subtraction.
**A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%**

**Basic:** 
*Year 9 Foundation Tier.* They know they need to multiply because they recognise "expanding brackets," but they are highly susceptible to the "$-1 \times -4 = -4$" error because they haven't internalised negative number rules.
**A=40% B=40% C=5% D=15%**

**Proficient:** 
*Year 9 Mid-to-High Tier.* These students are likely to get it right, but a significant minority will make a "silly mistake" by adding the numbers under pressure.
**A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%**

**Advanced:** 
*Targeting Grade 7-9 at GCSE.* These students will find this trivial and see it as a "trick" question because it’s almost too simple for them.
**A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%**

### Final Distribution Summary Table

| Category | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 15% | 30% | 35% |
| **Basic** | 40% | 40% | 5% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 80% | 5% | 0% | 15% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0% | 1% |

**Teacher's Verdict:** This question isn't a "guess" question; it's a **"confident wrong answer"** question. Option D is the most dangerous distractor for lower-ability students (addition instead of multiplication), while Option B is the most dangerous for middle-ability students (sign error).
