As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it targets one of the most persistent misconceptions in secondary education: the "Hierarchy of Operations" trap (specifically within BIDMAS/BODMAS).

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
While the arithmetic itself is Year 4 level, the conceptual logic required to navigate Problem P correctly is a major stumbling block even for Year 11s. It is a high "misconception activation" question. Students don't guess; they choose an incorrect answer with absolute confidence.

**The "BIDMAS Trap":** 
Most UK students are taught "Addition then Subtraction" because A comes before S in the acronym. They fail to realise that Addition and Subtraction possess equal priority and must be solved left-to-right. Therefore, many will insist you must do $5+6$ first in Problem P.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic:** (Operating at KS2 level/Below Grade 4 trajectory)
These students often read left-to-right regardless of operators, or get overwhelmed by choice.
*   **A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%**
*   *Logic:* They often choose A because they simply go left-to-right for both, or C because they’ve been told "Plus comes first" for both.

**Basic:** (Low Year 9 sets/Grade 4-5 trajectory)
This group knows "BIDMAS" as a rigid rule but lacks the nuance of equal priority.
*   **A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%**
*   *Logic:* They correctly identify the multiplication in Q but fall into the trap of doing $5+6$ first in P because "A comes before S". **Option D is the "Confidently Wrong" peak.**

**Proficient:** (Mid-to-High Year 9 sets/Grade 6-7 trajectory)
These students have started to encounter the "left-to-right" rule for P but are still prone to lapses under pressure.
*   **A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%**
*   *Logic:* Most have been corrected on the P problem by their teacher recently. They know B is the intended answer, though the "A before S" ghost still haunts about a quarter of the group.

**Advanced:** (Top Sets/Grade 8-9 trajectory)
These students understand that Addition/Subtraction and Multiplication/Division are inverse pairs with equal priority.
*   **A=2% B=95% C=0% D=3%**
*   *Logic:* They see the trap immediately. Only minor "silly mistakes" (reading the options too fast) would lead them away from B.

### Summary Table

| Group | A | B (Correct) | C | D (Trap) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 40% | 10% | 30% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 10% | 15% | 15% | **60%** |
| **Proficient** | 5% | **65%** | 5% | 25% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | **95%** | 0% | 3% |

**Teacher's Note:** If you set this in a typical UK classroom, the debate between B and D will be the loudest part of the lesson. Half the class will argue that "The A is before the S in BIDMAS," which is the very misconception this question is designed to expose.
