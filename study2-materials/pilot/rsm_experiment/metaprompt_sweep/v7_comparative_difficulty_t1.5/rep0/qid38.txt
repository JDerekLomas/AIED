As an experienced UK maths teacher, I would categorize this question as a classic **"Confidence Trap."** While the algebra itself is relatively foundational (Year 8/9 level), it targets a specific mechanical weakness regarding denominators that often persists into GCSE Foundation.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this sits just above the midpoint. It is more difficult than standard fraction addition because the denominators are not identical, and it is more difficult than numerical fractions because students are prone to "over-generalising" algebraic rules.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Rationale for predictions:**
*   **A (The Correct Answer):** Requires the student to find a common denominator ($2x$). They must multiply the second fraction by $2/2$, giving $8/2x$. Then $3+8=11$.
*   **B (The Add-Across Error):** This is a high-activation misconception. Students add the numerators ($3+4=7$) and add the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). It feels "logical" to a student struggling with the concept.
*   **C (The Denominator Neglect):** Students identify they need a common denominator but lose the $2$ in the process, or simply add $3+8$ and decide $x$ is the "common" part.
*   **D (The Numerator-only Error):** Students recognize $2x$ is the common denominator but forget to adjust the numerator of the second fraction (they add $3+4$ but keep $2x$).

| Category | A (Correct) | B (Misconception) | C (Partial Error) | D (The "Half-way") |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | **60%** | 15% | 15% |
| **Basic** | 35% | 30% | 10% | **25%** |
| **Proficient** | **75%** | 5% | 5% | 15% |
| **Advanced** | **95%** | 1% | 2% | 2% |

### Teacher’s Analysis:
*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level almost universally use the "add across" method (Option B). It is the most common error in UK classrooms for this topic. They are "confidently wrong."
*   **Basic:** These students know they aren't supposed to just add the bottoms, but they often forget to balance the numerator. They will likely choose D because they've correctly identified $2x$ as the denominator but failed the "equivalent fraction" step.
*   **Proficient:** These students have mastered the algorithm for common denominators. Errors here are usually "slip" errors (copying 3 instead of 8).
*   **Advanced:** This should be a 10-second mental arithmetic task for an advanced Year 9 student. They are unlikely to be distracted by the lures.
