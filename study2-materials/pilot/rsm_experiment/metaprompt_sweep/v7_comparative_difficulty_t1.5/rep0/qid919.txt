As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. On the surface, it’s a simple substitution task, but it is a "landmine" question. It targets three specific high-frequency misconceptions simultaneously: decimal multiplication, the order of operations (BIDMAS), and the distinction between squaring and doubling.

For a Year 9 class, this isn't difficult because the concepts are complex; it’s difficult because it demands high "fluency hygiene."

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the arithmetic is "Primary school level" in theory, the combination of a coefficient ($3$) and a decimal squared ($0.3^2$) creates a high cognitive load for Year 9s who rely on intuitive number sense rather than formal rules.

### Prediction Rationale:
*   **The Trap (Option A: 0.81):** This is for students who do $(3 \times 0.3)^2$. They ignore BIDMAS and multiply before squaring.
*   **The Trap (Option C: 1.8):** This is the most common "below basic" error. They think squaring is doubling ($0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$), then $0.6 \times 3 = 1.8$.
*   **The Trap (Option D: 2.7):** This is the "Decimal Point Error." Students correctly calculate $3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27$, but misplace the decimal point because they think $0.3^2 = 0.9$ (forgetting that $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$).
*   **The Correct Answer (Option B: 0.27):** Requires knowing $0.3^2 = 0.09$, then $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working at Grade 1-2):**
*A=15% B=10% C=50% D=25%*
These students will likely double instead of square or simply guess between the numbers that "look like 27 or 81." Option C will be very high here.

**Basic (Working at Grade 3-4):**
*A=35% B=20% C=15% D=30%*
This group will struggle with the order of operations. Many will calculate $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$. Others will get $0.9 \times 3$ and arrive at $2.7$.

**Proficient (Working at Grade 5-6):**
*A=15% B=55% C=5% D=25%*
Most will remember BIDMAS. The battle here is the decimal point. Many "decent" students instinctively think $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. Option D is the main distractor for this cohort.

**Advanced (Working at Grade 7+):**
*A=2% B=90% C=3% D=5%*
Top-set Year 9s should handle this comfortably, though a few will make a "silly mistake" by rushing the decimal multiplication.

**Teacher's Note:** If I were marking this, I would expect a high degree of **"Confident Incorrectness."** Students won't guess randomly; they will perform a calculation, see their result as an option, and move on without questioning the logic. Option D is particularly dangerous because $2.7$ "feels" like a more reasonable magnitude than $0.27$ to a student with weak decimal sense.
