As an experienced UK maths teacher, I would categorize this as a **"Low Floor, High Trap"** question. While the arithmetic itself is straightforward (the denominators are already common), the presence of specific distractors makes it a litmus test for conceptual understanding versus rote-learned "rules."

### DIFFICULTY: 3/10
For a Year 9 student, the addition required ($2+1$ and $1/5+2/5$) is technically Year 4/5 content. However, in a Year 9 context, this falls at a 3 because students often "over-mathematize" simple problems, applying rules for multiplication to addition or forgetting the instruction regarding the format of the answer.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working below Age Related Expectations)**
These students often treat the numerator and denominator as four independent integers. The "Add the tops, add the bottoms" misconception is extremely powerful here.
*   **A=15% B=5% C=35% D=45%**
*   *Reasoning:* D is the classic "add everything" error ($2+1=3$, $1+2=3$, $5+5=10$). C represents adding the fractions and ignored the whole numbers, or a total breakdown of the algorithm.

**Basic (Developing understanding)**
These students know to keep the denominator the same, but they often forget the specific instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number, or they convert to improper fractions as a "safety" reflex and stop there.
*   **A=50% B=30% C=5% D=15%**
*   *Reasoning:* Many will correctly calculate $18/5$ and see it listed as option B. They stop there, feeling successful, and ignore that the question asks for a mixed number.

**Proficient (Meeting Age Related Expectations)**
These students have mastered the algorithm for adding fractions with common denominators and are observant enough to read the final instruction.
*   **A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%**
*   *Reasoning:* Most will get A. The small percentage for B represents those who go into "auto-pilot" and convert everything to improper fractions first, then forget to convert back.

**Advanced (Exceeding Age Related Expectations)**
These students spot the common denominator immediately and solve it mentally.
*   **A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%**
*   *Reasoning:* Error rates here are almost exclusively down to "silly mistakes" (reading the '+' as a '×') or extreme rushing.

### Teacher's Note on Misconceptions:
The "Confidence in being Wrong" score for **Option D** is very high for lower-ability sets. They see $3/10$ and it "looks" right because they have operated on every number visible in the question. **Option B** is the most dangerous distractor for mid-ability students; they perform correct maths but fail the "functional" part of the question (following the format instruction).
