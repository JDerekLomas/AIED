As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it moves away from procedural "solving" and into **conceptual fluency and order of operations**.

In a Year 9 classroom, this is a classic "trap" question. It tests whether students understand that an equation is a balance that must be maintained through consistent operations across *all* terms.

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
While the algebra itself is relatively simple (foundation tier GCSE level), the "distractor" provided by Katie is highly seductive. This isn't a difficulty 10 because it doesn't require complex manipulation, but it’s a 6 because it targets a very specific, high-frequency misconception regarding the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction.

### The Misconception:
*   **Tom** is correct: He added 5 to both sides ($12 + 5 = 17$).
*   **Katie** is incorrect: She multiplied the left side by 3 but failed to multiply the $-5$ by 3. She essentially did $3(\frac{x}{3}) - 5$, whereas the balanced operation requires $3(\frac{x}{3} - 5)$, which would result in $x - 15 = 36$.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working below Grade 4/D):**
These students often struggle with inverse operations. They might see "36" and think Katie must be right because $12 \times 3 = 36$. They rarely check the middle term.
*   **A=15% | B=35% | C=40% | D=10%**
*   *Insight:* High "Both" (C) selection because they think both look like "mathsy" things to do.

**Basic (Working at Grade 4-5/C):**
These students have been drilled in "do the same to both sides," but their application is patchy. Many will fall into Katie's trap because they associate the $\frac{x}{3}$ with the need to multiply by 3 immediately.
*   **A=40% | B=20% | C=35% | D=5%**
*   *Insight:* This group is most likely to "confidently get it wrong" by choosing C.

**Proficient (Working at Grade 6-7/B-A):**
These students usually know to "isolate the $x$ term first" (Tom's method). They will recognize Tom is right, but a significant portion will still see Katie’s "36" and assume she has just taken a different, valid path.
*   **A=65% | B=5% | C=28% | D=2%**
*   *Insight:* The jump from C to A happens here as students start to mentally check the expansion of $3(x/3 - 5)$.

**Advanced (Working at Grade 8-9/A*):**
These students look for the nuance. They will immediately spot that Katie didn't multiply the $-5$ by 3.
*   **A=92% | B=1% | C=5% | D=2%**
*   *Insight:* Errors here are usually due to rushing rather than a lack of understanding.

### Summary Table

| Category | A (Only Tom) | B (Only Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 35% | 40% | 10% |
| **Basic** | 40% | 20% | 35% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 65% | 5% | 28% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 92% | 1% | 5% | 2% |

**Teacher's Note:** This is an excellent "diagnostic question." If a large portion of your class chooses C, they haven't yet grasped that an operation applied to one side of an equation must apply to the *entire* expression on that side.
