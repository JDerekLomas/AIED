As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question through the lens of **fraction arithmetic**, which remains a significant hurdle for Year 9 students. 

While the concept is taught in Key Stage 2 and 3, mixed number addition with different denominators is a "multi-step" process where students often hunt for shortcuts that lead to common misconceptions.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this is mid-range difficulty. It isn't "hard" in terms of abstract reasoning, but it is high-risk for **procedural errors**. The instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number" is a crucial distractor filter.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to Distractors:**
*   **A ($ \frac{99}{20} $):** The mathematically correct value, but in the wrong *format* (improper fraction instead of mixed number).
*   **B ($ 4 \frac{19}{20} $):** The correct answer.
*   **C ($ \frac{99}{40} $):** Misconception: Multiplying the denominators ($10 \times 4$) instead of finding the Lowest Common Multiple.
*   **D ($ 4 \frac{8}{14} $):** The classic "Add across" error (add whole numbers, add numerators, add denominators). This is the highest "confidence" misconception.

| Group | A (Improper) | B (Correct) | C (Mult. Denom) | D (Add Across) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 15% | 25% | **50%** |
| **Basic** | 20% | **45%** | 15% | 20% |
| **Proficient** | 25% | **65%** | 5% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 10% | **88%** | 2% | 0% |

### Teacher’s Analysis:

1.  **The "Add Across" Trap (D):** Among "Below Basic" students, Option D will be the most popular choice. Students find fractions frustrating and will instinctively revert to the simplest logic: $2+2=4, 7+1=8, 10+4=14$. They will select this with high confidence.
2.  **The Format Penalty (A):** "Proficient" students often convert everything to improper fractions to calculate ($27/10 + 9/4 = 54/20 + 45/20 = 99/20$). A significant portion will stop there, ignoring the "Leave your answer as a mixed number" instruction.
3.  **The Denominator Dilemma (C):** Students who remember they need a common denominator but lack "number sense" will often just multiply $10 \times 4$ to get $40$. While they *can* get to the right answer from there, they often make arithmetic slips when scaling numerators by 4 and 10 respectively, leading to errors.
4.  **Advanced Success:** Advanced students will recognize that $10$ and $4$ go into $20$ almost instantly. Their main risk is a "silly error" in basic addition ($54 + 45$), but most will navigate this comfortably.
