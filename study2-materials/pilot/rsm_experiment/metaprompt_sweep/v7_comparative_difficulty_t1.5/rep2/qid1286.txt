This is a classic "subject-rearrangement" task embedded within a geometry context. For a Year 9 student, this represents a significant jump in cognitive load because it requires three distinct steps: recalling (or identifying) the volume formula, applying inverse operations correctly, and dealing with a fractional coefficient.

### DIFFICULTY: 8/10
While "solving a quadratic by completing the square" is technically more complex algebraically, it is a procedural algorithm. Rearranging a formula with a fraction ($\frac{4}{3}$) and a power of 3 often leads to higher error rates in Year 9 due to a lack of "fractional fluency" and the visual intimidation of the cube root.

### Distribution Analysis
*   **The "Inverse Error" (A):** Students see the $3$ and $4$ and know they need to "do something" with them. Many multiply by both because they struggle with the concept of dividing by a fraction.
*   **The "Pi Placement" (B):** This is for students who understand the $4$ and $3$ but get "lost" with $\pi$, often thinking it stays as a numerator because it's "at the top" in their minds.
*   **The Correct Logic (C):** The intended answer.
*   **The Visual Guess (D):** Common among students who don't understand that the cube root must apply to the entire expression, not just the $V$.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working at Year 7/8 level)**
*A=45% B=20% C=10% D=25%*
*   **Logic:** These students will likely pick A because the $4$, $\pi$, and $3$ are all present in a "multiplied" string, which looks like a standard volume calculation. D is also attractive because it looks "mathsy."

**Basic (Working at expected Year 9 level)**
*A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%*
*   **Logic:** High misconception activation. They will attempt to rearrange but will likely fail the "divide by 4, multiply by 3" step, leading to A or B. 

**Proficient (GCSE Foundation/Higher Crossover)**
*A=15% B=20% C=55% D=10%*
*   **Logic:** These students can perform the rearrangement $V = \frac{4\pi r^3}{3} \rightarrow 3V = 4\pi r^3$. Most will successfully move the $4\pi$ to the denominator, though some will make a clerical error (B).

**Advanced (Targeting Grade 8/9 GCSE)**
*A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%*
*   **Logic:** These students treat the formula as a literal equation and move the terms systematically. Errors here are usually due to rushing rather than a lack of understanding.
