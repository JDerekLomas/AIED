This is a fantastic "diagnostic" style question. It doesn't just test if a student can find a mean; it tests their understanding of **place value/zero as a placeholder** and their knowledge of **order of operations (BIDMAS)**.

In a typical Year 9 class, this is a "trap" question. Many students will perform the calculation correctly if asked to "find the mean," but they fail to spot the mathematical technicalities in the expressions provided.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the numbers are small, the difficulty lies in the high "misconception activation." It feels easy, which makes students reckless.

### Teacher’s Analysis of the Distractors:

*   **A) The "Zero doesn't count" Trap:** This is the most popular choice for "Basic" students. They know the formula is "sum divided by how many," but they subconsciously treat 0 as "nothing," so they don't see the need to write it in the numerator. *Mathematically, this expression is correct ($15 \div 5 = 3$), which makes it a very "confidently wrong" choice.*
*   **B) The BIDMAS Trap:** Students who rely on how they type things into a non-fractional calculator will choose this. They don't realize that without brackets, only the 7 is being divided by 5 ($0+1+3+4+1.4 = 9.4$). 
*   **C) The "Denominator" Trap:** For students who think 0 doesn't count as a "value," they will assume the set only has 4 numbers. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of data sets.
*   **D) The Correct Answer:** Option A is technically the correct *value*, but if the question is "which calculation shows the mean of **the following numbers**," one could argue the 0 must be represented to show the process of $n=5$. However, the real "gotcha" for advanced students is realizing that while A is numerically correct, it is often a lucky coincidence in the eyes of a purist. 

**Note to the teacher:** Most students will pick **A** and argue fiercely that they are right because "adding zero doesn't change the sum." This is a great springboard to discuss whether 0 counts as a "data point" (e.g., "If you scored 0 on a test, does it affect your average?").
