As an experienced UK maths teacher, I would categorize this question as a test of **Notation and Priority of Operations**. 

While the concept of "division as a fraction bar" is introduced in Year 7, Year 9 students still frequently struggle with the visual structure of algebra versus the linear nature of BIDMAS/PEDMAS. This question specifically targets a "confident misconception" regarding the "numerator vs denominator" order and the "horizontal bar as a grouping symbol."

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this is an "easy-mid" difficulty question. It isn't mathematically complex, but it is a "trap" for students who work too quickly or have a weak grasp of how division is represented visually.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to student tiers:**
*   **Below Basic:** Working significantly below age-related expectations (KS2 level).
*   **Basic:** Fluency in simple arithmetic, but struggles with abstract algebraic notation.
*   **Proficient:** Understands the "big rules" of algebra but may make "silly" errors under pressure.
*   **Advanced:** Fully understands the hierarchy of operations and algebraic equivalents.

| Tier | A | B | C | D | Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | **35%** | 10% | 20% | **35%** | High confusion between the dividend and divisor; D is the classic "flipped" fraction error. |
| **Basic** | **55%** | 5% | 15% | 25% | Most understand A is the structure, but C is a tempting "literal" translation of the sequence. |
| **Proficient** | **85%** | 2% | 5% | 8% | Most get it right, but a small portion will still reflexively put the "bigger" expression on top (D). |
| **Advanced** | **98%** | 0% | 1% | 1% | These students treat the fraction bar as a vinculum/bracket instinctively. |

### Teacher's Commentary:
*   **The "Trap" (D):** This is the highest "confidence" wrong answer. Students often struggle to remember whether the first number goes on the top or bottom. In their minds, $h+4$ looks "bigger" or "heavier," so they instinctively place it as the numerator.
*   **The "Literalist" (C):** Students who view algebra as a direct left-to-right translation will pick C. They see $c \div h$ and write $\frac{c}{h}$, then simply "tack on" the $+4$ without realizing the brackets change the entire denominator.
*   **The "Over-Thinker" (B):** Usually a very low response rate; this only happens if a student tries to "balance" the fraction by adding $+4$ to both sides, confusing this with equivalent fractions.
