This is a classic "trapped in the details" question. For a Year 9 student (ages 13–14), it bridges the gap between basic fraction operations and early algebraic manipulation.

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**

**Teacher’s Insight:**
While the calculation is simple (finding a reciprocal), this question is a "high misconception" trap. Many students understand the *concept* of the reciprocal (flipping the fraction) but have a weak grasp of how negative signs interact under multiplication to produce a specific result. This is a question where students "confidently get it wrong" by choosing A, assuming that "flipping" is the only step required and ignoring the sign needed to reach -1.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Below Basic (Working below Grade Level)**
*These students often associate "reciprocal" with "opposite" and get muddled between additive inverses and multiplicative inverses. Many will see the negative in the question and choose a positive answer just to "change something."*
*   **A=40% B=15% C=30% D=15%**
*   *Primary error:* Choosing C or A because they look "right" or they forget the result must be negative.

**Basic (Targeting Grade 3/4)**
*These students remember the rule "to get 1, flip the fraction." However, they often forget that to get -1, they need a positive multiplied by a negative. A is the most common "confident" wrong answer here.*
*   **A=55% B=25% C=10% D=10%**
*   *Primary error:* Selecting A (the reciprocal) but neglecting the sign.

**Proficient (Targeting Grade 5/6)**
*These students check their work. They will likely perform the mental check: "negative times what equals negative?" They know they need a positive number. Most will successfully navigate to A.*
*   **A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%**
*   *Success profile:* They recognize that $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -\frac{12}{12} = -1$.

**Advanced (Targeting Grade 7+)**
*These students treat this as a one-step linear equation ($-\frac{3}{4}x = -1$). They are highly unlikely to make a sign error because they understand the structural properties of rational numbers.*
*   **A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%**
*   *Success profile:* Near-instant recognition of the multiplicative identity and the sign balance.

### **Summary of the Trap**
The "Distractor A" ($4/3$) is the powerhouse here. In a Year 9 classroom, you will hear a student say, *"But you have to flip it to get one!"* They focus so hard on the **numerical value** 1 that they ignore the **sign** -1. Option B is the second most common error for students who think "flipping" always requires keeping the sign the same, which would result in a positive 1.
