As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently. While it appears simple, it is a "classic" diagnostic question designed to catch specific procedural misconceptions during the expansion of binomials.

### DIFFICULTY: 3/10
For a Year 9 student, the calculation itself ($1 \times 4$) is primary school level. However, the difficulty lies in the **simultaneous application of two rules**: the directed number rule (multiplying negatives) and the algebraic operation rule (identifying that we multiply, rather than add, when expanding brackets).

### Predicted Response Distributions

**below_basic:** These students often see numbers in a row and default to addition/subtraction. They see $-1$ and $-4$ and intuitively combine them to get $-5$. They may not yet associate "expanding brackets" with multiplication.
*   **A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60%**

**basic:** These students know they need to multiply because of the context of the question ("expanding brackets"). However, their grasp of negative number rules is shaky. They often remember "a negative and a negative makes a..." but get the sign wrong, or assume that because the numbers in the brackets are negative, the result must stay negative.
*   **A=40% B=45% C=5% D=10%**

**proficient:** Most students in this bracket have mastered the "Signs Same = Positive" rule for multiplication. They understand the "FOIL" or "Grid" method and correctly identify that these are the "Last" terms being multiplied.
*   **A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%**

**advanced:** For an advanced Year 9 student, this is trivial. Errors at this level are almost exclusively "slips" (misreading the question as asking for the sum) rather than misconceptions.
*   **A=97% B=1% C=1% D=1%**

### Teacher's Analysis of Misconceptions

1.  **The "Addition" Trap (D):** This is the high-confidence misconception. Students see $-1$ and $-4$ and their brain performs $-1 - 4 = -5$. This is the most common error for lower-attaining Year 9s.
2.  **The "Subtraction" Trap (C):** Similar to above, but the student performs a "difference" calculation or ignores one sign ($+4 - 1 = +5$ or $4 + 1 = 5$).
3.  **The Sign Error (B):** This student knows to multiply $(1 \times 4 = 4)$, but believes that "a minus and a minus stays a minus." This is a carry-over from addition rules (where $-1 + -4 = -5$) applied incorrectly to multiplication.
