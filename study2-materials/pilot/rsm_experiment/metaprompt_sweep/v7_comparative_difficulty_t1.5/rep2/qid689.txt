As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. On the surface, it is a one-step rearrangement. However, for a Year 9 student, it contains a significant "bottleneck" concept: **the unknown as the denominator.**

Most students are used to the structure $\frac{p}{5}=10$, where they simply multiply. When $p$ is on the bottom, it triggers a "confidence trap." Many students will perform an operation they know (multiplication) without checking if the logic holds.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the arithmetic is Year 4 level, the algebraic manipulation required to handle a denominator variable makes this harder than standard linear equations (like $2x + 3 = 11$). It ranks a 6 because it specifically targets a common structural misconception.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Definitions:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students working at KS2/early KS3 level; struggling with fractions.
*   **Basic:** Target Grade 3; can solve $x + 5 = 10$, but struggles with division structures.
*   **Proficient:** Target Grade 5; understands the "switch" rule but may rush.
*   **Advanced:** Target Grade 7+; intuitive understanding of reciprocals and verification.

| Group | A ($0.5$) | B ($50$) | C ($2$) | D (None) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | **65%** | 20% | 5% |
| **Basic** | 25% | **45%** | 25% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | **60%** | 15% | 20% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | **95%** | 2% | 3% | 0% |

### Teacher's Analysis of the Errors:

*   **The "Multiply Everything" Trap (Choice B - 50):** This is the most common error for Basic/Below Basic students. They see a '5' and a '10' and a fraction bar. Their brain signals "inverse of divide is multiply," so they do $10 \times 5 = 50$. This is a classic "Confident Wrong" answer.
*   **The "Commutative Division" Trap (Choice C - 2):** Students see 10 and 5 and simply divide the larger by the smaller. They assume $\frac{5}{p}$ is the same as $\frac{p}{5}$ or they believe $10 \div 5$ must be the intended path. This is a common "guess" for students who feel 50 is too large.
*   **The "Correct Swap" (Choice A - 0.5):** Proficient students know that to solve for $p$, they must multiply by $p$ then divide by 10 (effectively swapping the 10 and the $p$). They arrive at $p = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5$.
*   **The "Over-thinker" (Choice D):** Usually chosen by students who believe you "can't have a smaller number on top of a bigger one" in an equation, or those who get frustrated and assume it's a trick question.

**Summary:** For a typical Year 9 mixed-ability set, you will likely see a "Bimodal Distribution." Half the class will confidently select **B** and the other half will correctly select **A**. Very few will be "unsure"—they will simply apply the wrong rule with total certainty.
