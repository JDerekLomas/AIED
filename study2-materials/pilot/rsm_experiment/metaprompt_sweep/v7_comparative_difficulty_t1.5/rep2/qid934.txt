As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this as a classic "low ceiling, high trap" question. For a Year 9 student, it sits right at the intersection of substitution, solving linear equations, and interpreting tabular data.

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
While the arithmetic ($10 \div 2$) is easy, the **implicit form** of the equation ($4x + 2y = 10$) makes it significantly harder than the standard $y = mx + c$ format. Most Year 9s are conditioned to see $x$ and then do something to it to get $y$. When $x$ and $y$ are on the same side, the "flow" of the calculation is disrupted.

### The Misconception Profiles
*   **The "4 + 2 = 6" Thinker:** They might look at the numbers in the equation and try to combine them without substituting.
*   **The "x is 0" Eraser:** Many students will correctly identify that $4(0) = 0$, but then freeze at $2y = 10$. Some will think the $2$ must be subtracted ($10 - 2 = 8$) or that since $x=0$, the whole left side is $0$.
*   **The Proportionality Trap (Option A):** Students see $4$ and $10$ and think $4 \times 5 = 20$.
*   **The Intercept Swapper (Option D):** Students who confuse $x$ and $y$ intercepts or mistakenly divide 10 by 4 instead of 2.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working toward KS3 Stage 3/4):**
These students often struggle with the "equals" sign. Many will pick **C** simply because it looks like half of 10, or **A** because they try to multiply all the visible integers.
*   A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%

**Basic (Working at KS3 Stage 5/6):**
This group understands substitution but often fails at the "inverse operations" step. They see $x=0$, vanish the $4x$ term, but then guess how to handle the $2y$. A significant portion will pick **C** because $10 \div 2 = 5$ is an intuitive "clean" answer.
*   A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%

**Proficient (GCSE Grade 4/5 target):**
The majority will get this right. They substitute $x=0$, recognise that $2y=10$, and divide. The main errors here are "confident wrongness"—mistaking the coefficient of $y$ for $x$.
*   A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%

**Advanced (GCSE Grade 7-9 target):**
For these students, this is a 10-second task. The only risk is a "silly mistake" or misreading the table.
*   A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%

**Summary for Year 9 Teacher:**
Expect a high success rate for **B**, but use it as a diagnostic tool. If students pick **C**, they aren't solving $2y=10$, they are likely just picking a factor of 10. If they pick **D**, they are confused about which variable is being substituted.
