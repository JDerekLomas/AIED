As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it highlights the "traps" of BIDMAS (or BODMAS) that persist even into Key Stage 4.

The core of the issue here is that students are often taught BIDMAS as a rigid vertical hierarchy rather than a grouping of operations. Many students believe Addition **must** come before Subtraction simply because the letter 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym.

### Difficulty Rating: 4/10
While the arithmetic is simple (Year 4/5 level), the conceptual understanding of "equal priority" operations (Addition and Subtraction) is a persistent misconception. For a typical Year 9 class, this is an "easy" looking question that will catch out a surprising number of students.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to Understanding the Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Struggling with basic numeracy/order of operations.
*   **Basic:** Knows the acronym BIDMAS but follows it literally/rigidly.
*   **Proficient:** Understands order of operations but might still slip up on left-to-right rules.
*   **Advanced:** Fully understands that $+$ and $-$ have equal priority and $\times$ beats $+$.

| Category | A | B (Correct) | C | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 40% | 15% | 15% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 10% | 20% | 15% | 55% |
| **Proficient** | 5% | 65% | 5% | 25% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 95% | 1% | 2% |

### Teacher's Analysis of the Errors:

*   **Option D (The "BIDMAS Trap"):** This will be the most popular wrong answer. Students who have been taught "Addition then Subtraction" will see the $+6$ in Problem P and assume they must do $5+6$ first. They get Problem Q right but fall for the misconception in Problem P. This is a classic "confident wrong" scenario.
*   **Option A (The "Left-to-Right" Error):** These students ignore BIDMAS entirely and just work from left to right for both. This is common for students with very low numeracy confidence who treat maths like reading a sentence.
*   **Option B (The Correct Answer):** Requires the student to know two distinct rules: 1) Multiplication takes precedence over addition, and 2) Addition and Subtraction have equal priority (so we work left to right).
*   **Option C (The Worst of Both Worlds):** Rarely chosen; it implies they think addition always comes first, regardless of multiplication being present.

**Summary:** This is a high "misconception activation" question. I would expect many Year 9 students to confidently choose **D**, leading to a fantastic "teachable moment" when the teacher reveals why it’s actually B.
