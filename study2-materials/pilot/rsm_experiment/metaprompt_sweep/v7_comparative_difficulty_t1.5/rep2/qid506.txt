As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It is a classic "trap" question that exposes a lack of conceptual fluency with fractions and inverse operations. 

While the algebra itself is simple (one-step linear equation), the fractional result triggers a very high level of **misconception activation**. Students don't guess randomly here; they confidently perform the wrong operation.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a Year 9 student, this is harder than it looks. While "completing the square" (Difficulty 10) involves more steps, this question requires overcoming a powerful intuitive urge to make the numbers "fit" nicely.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working towards GCSE Grade 1-2)**
*   **A is the winner here.** These students see 3 and 12 and immediately think of the relationship $12 \div 3 = 4$. They ignore the fact that the 12 is a denominator.
*   **C is the "panic" choice.** They see 3 and 12, decide the answer must be 4, and ignore the fractional nature entirely.

**Basic (Working towards GCSE Grade 3-4)**
*   **A remains the dominant misconception.** They understand they need to divide by 3, but their mental model for $ \frac{1}{12} \div 3 $ is flawed. They instinctively "divide the bottom number" by the coefficient, or simply associate 3 and 12 with 4.
*   **B starts to appear** for those who remember they need to multiply the denominator.

**Proficient (Working towards GCSE Grade 5-6)**
*   **B is now the majority.** Most students in this bracket know that to solve for $p$, you divide by 3. They correctly calculate $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$.
*   **A still lingers** as a "silly mistake" caused by rushing.

**Advanced (Working towards GCSE Grade 7-9)**
*   **B is near universal.** These students have automated the process of multiplying the denominator when dividing a fraction by an integer.

### Teacher’s Insight:
The most common "confident" wrong answer is **A**. Students often mistakenly apply the rule for *multiplying* a fraction by 3 (which would be $\frac{3}{12}$ or $\frac{1}{4}$) instead of *dividing* by 3. They see a 3 and a 12 and their brain "wants" the answer to be 4 or 1/4.
