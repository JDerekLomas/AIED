This is a classic "lure" question that identifies whether a student understands inverse operations or is simply operating on autopilot with number patterns.

In Step 1, the student correctly multiplies by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). In Step 2, the student fails to subtract 1, instead adding it to the 60. This is a very common "high misconception activation" error where the student sees "$+1$" and instinctively moves it to the other side as an addition, or simply tries to make the numbers "fit" $(60+1=61)$.

For a typical Year 9 class (approx. age 13-14), I would rate this:

**DIFFICULTY: 4/10**

It is not technically difficult, but it is "tricky." Most Year 9s can solve a two-step equation, but when presented with someone else's working, their critical thinking often falters.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Bottom 25%):**
These students often struggle with fractions. Many will think Step 1 is wrong because they don't recognise that the vinculum (fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol.
*   **A=15% B=15% C=40% D=30%**

**Basic (Lower Middle):**
This is the "High Misconception" group. They will correctly identify that $15 \times 4 = 60$, but their grasp of inverse operations is shaky. They see the $+1$ and the $61$ and think "that looks right."
*   **A=30% B=5% C=55% D=10%**

**Proficient (Upper Middle):**
These students are more rigorous. They will mentally or physically solve $60 = 1 + k$ and realize $k$ should be $59$. They are likely to spot the error in Step 2.
*   **A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%**

**Advanced (Top 10%):**
These students will immediately identify the "add/subtract" error in Step 2.
*   **A=95% B=0% C=2% D=3%**

**Summary Analysis:**
The most common wrong answer will be **C**. Students in the middle ability range often "read" math steps like a story rather than verifying the logic; because 60 and 1 make 61, Step 2 *feels* correct to them. The "advanced" students will find this trivial (Difficulty 2), but for a "basic" student, it is a high-risk trap.
