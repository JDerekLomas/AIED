As an experienced UK maths teacher, I would place this question firmly in the "confidence without competence" category for Year 9. While it looks like a simple addition, it triggers a very specific, high-frequency misconception regarding denominators.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this is harder than standard integer fractions but easier than algebraic fractions with binomial denominators (e.g., $x+2$). The challenge here isn't the algebra; it's the "common denominator" logic.

### Pedagogical Analysis
The most dangerous distractor here is **B**. Students often "add across" (3+4 and 2x+x), treating the numerator and denominator as independent addition problems. This is a "confidently wrong" mistake. **D** is the classic "I forgot to multiply the numerator" error, where a student recognizes the common denominator is $2x$ but fails to scale the $4$.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic** (Working towards KS3 expectations)
*These students struggle with fraction rules in general. They are highly likely to add across the top and bottom.*
*   **A=10% | B=70% | C=10% | D=10%**

**Basic** (Meeting age-related expectations)
*These students know they need a common denominator but often make "partial" errors. They might choose 2x as the denominator but forget to change the 4 to an 8.*
*   **A=40% | B=20% | C=10% | D=30%**

**Proficient** (Strong GCSE Foundation/Low Higher)
*These students have practiced the routine. They will correctly identify the common denominator ($2x$) and adjust the second fraction to $8/2x$.*
*   **A=80% | B=5% | C=5% | D=10%**

**Advanced** (High-ability Year 9 / Level 7+)
*For these students, this is a "fluency" question. Errors would likely only be due to extreme haste.*
*   **A=98% | B=0% | C=1% | D=1%**

***

**Key for the Correct Answer (A):**
1. Recognize the common denominator is $2x$.
2. Multiply $\frac{4}{x}$ by $\frac{2}{2}$ to get $\frac{8}{2x}$.
3. $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.
