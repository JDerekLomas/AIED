As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. On the surface, it is a simple substitution into a quadratic formula. However, it is a "minefield" question because it targets three specific misconceptions simultaneously: decimal multiplication, the order of operations (BIDMAS), and the distinction between squaring and doubling.

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**
For a Year 9 student, this is harder than it looks. While "completing the square" (10/10) requires a complex multi-step algorithm, this question requires precise conceptual knowledge. Most students will *confidently* perform the wrong operation.

### **Misconception Activation**
This is a **High Misconception** question. Very few students will guess randomly; almost all will perform a calculation that leads directly to one of the distractors.
*   **The "Squaring Distractor" (0.81):** Students do $(3 \times 0.3)^2$. They multiply first, then square.
*   **The "Place Value Distractor" (2.7):** Students correctly square $0.3$ but think $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ (forgetting the second decimal place), then $0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$.
*   **The "Linear Distractor" (1.8):** Students mistake $x^2$ for $2x$, calculating $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Below Basic (Working at Grade 1-2):**
These students often struggle with BIDMAS and the concept of squaring. They are highly likely to double the number or multiply everything together.
*   **A=15% | B=10% | C=50% | D=25%**
*   *Primary error:* Calculating $3 \times 0.3 \times 2$ (Option C).

**Basic (Working at Grade 3-4):**
These students know to square first, but they almost always fail the decimal place value check. They believe $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$.
*   **A=10% | B=15% | C=10% | D=65%**
*   *Primary error:* $0.3^2 = 0.9$; then $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ (Option D). This is the most "popular" wrong answer in Y9.

**Proficient (Working at Grade 5-6):**
These students are wary of decimals but often succumb to the "bracket" instinct—multiplying $3$ and $0.3$ first because they appear together in the expression.
*   **A=40% | B=35% | C=5% | D=20%**
*   *Primary error:* Doing $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then squaring to get $0.81$. They are starting to get Option B correct, but under pressure, BIDMAS fails them.

**Advanced (Working at Grade 7+):**
These students have mastered BIDMAS and fractional/decimal multiplication. They recognize $0.3^2$ as $0.09$ or $(3/10)^2$ as $9/100$.
*   **A=5% | B=90% | C=0% | D=5%**
*   *Outcome:* Most will get B, but a small percentage might rush and choose D if they don't double-check their decimal points.

**Correct Answer: B (0.27)**
*Calculation: $3(0.3)^2 \rightarrow 3(0.09) \rightarrow 0.27$.*
