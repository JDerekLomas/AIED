As a UK maths teacher, I see this as a "bread and butter" GCSE Foundation topic that is surprisingly prone to execution errors. While the concept is taught in Year 6 (KS2), Year 9 students often struggle with the dual-processing requirement: managing the whole numbers while finding a common denominator for the fractions.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this is a **high-misconception** question rather than a guessing game. Students usually feel they "know how to do it," which leads to overconfidence and common systematic errors.

### The Misconception Profiles:
*   **The "Add Across" Error (Distractor D):** Students add the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$). This is the most common error in KS3.
*   **The Improper Fraction Trap (Distractor A):** High-performing students often convert to improper fractions ($27/10 + 9/4$) to ensure accuracy, find the correct sum ($99/20$), but then fail to read the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
*   **The Denominator Multiplication Error (Distractor C):** Students know they need a common denominator but simply multiply $10 \times 4$ to get 40, then fail to adjust the numerators correctly or forget to simplify.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working toward Grade 1/2):**
*Focus: Very high activation of the "add across" rule.*
*   A=10% | **B=15%** | C=25% | **D=50%**

**Basic (Working toward Grade 3/4):**
*Focus: Attempting a common denominator but making arithmetic slips or getting stuck at the improper fraction stage.*
*   A=30% | **B=40%** | C=15% | D=15%

**Proficient (Working toward Grade 5/6):**
*Focus: Strong understanding; the main error here is Distractor A (failing to convert back to a mixed number).*
*   A=15% | **B=75%** | C=5% | D=5%

**Advanced (Working toward Grade 7+):**
*Focus: High precision and attention to the final format required.*
*   A=3% | **B=95%** | C=1% | D=1%

### Teacher’s Insight:
The inclusion of **A** ($99/20$) is the "pro-level" distractor. In a high-stakes setting, even your best students might choose A because it is mathematically equivalent to the correct sum, and they often relax once they reach a numeric value that matches an option, neglecting the specific formatting instruction ("mixed number").
