This is a staple GCSE foundation and higher tier topic. For a Year 9 student, expanding double brackets is a core skill usually taught in the middle of the year.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10

While the "FOIL" or grid method is mechanical, this specific question is a "minefield" of directed number (integers) rules. It is not difficult because of the algebra, but because it tests three different sign rules simultaneously:
1.  $-5 + -7 = -12$ (Middle term)
2.  $-5 \times -7 = +35$ (Last term)
3.  The common misconception that "a minus and a minus always make a plus" (leading students to apply multiplication rules to the addition part of the expansion).

### Response Distributions

**Below Basic:** These students struggle with directed numbers. They often forget the "outer" and "inner" terms entirely or simply guess the signs. They are very likely to choose **D** because they see two minus signs in the question and assume the answer must end in a minus.

**Basic:** These students know the method but have "shaky" integer rules. They often get the $-12m$ correct but fail the $-5 \times -7$ calculation, incorrectly thinking it stays negative.

**Proficient:** These students have mastered the grid/FOIL method and usually remember that a negative times a negative is a positive. However, under time pressure, a small percentage may still make a sign slip.

**Advanced:** These students see the pattern instantly. Mistakes are rare and usually down to a "finger slip" rather than a lack of understanding.

| Group | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 20% | 20% | 40% |
| **Basic** | 15% | 45% | 10% | 30% |
| **Proficient** | 5% | 85% | 5% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 1% | 98% | 1% | 0% |

### Key Misconception Analysis:
*   **Choice D ($m^2 - 12m - 35$):** This is the "confident wrong" answer. Students correctly sum $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$, but then apply "addition logic" to the multiplication, thinking $-5 \times -7 = -35$ because "the numbers were negative to start with."
*   **Choice A ($m^2 - 2m - 35$):** This stems from students who subtract the numbers ($7-5$) instead of summing them, or confusedly apply the "difference of two squares" logic partially.
*   **Choice C ($m^2 + 12m + 35$):** The "all minus equals plus" misconception where students over-generalise and flip every sign in the expression to positive.
