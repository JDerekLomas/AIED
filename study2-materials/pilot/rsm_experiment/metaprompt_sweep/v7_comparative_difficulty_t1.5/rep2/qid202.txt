As a UK maths teacher, I see this as a standard "fluency" question that tests two distinct things: the arithmetic of fractions and the ability to follow a specific formatting instruction ("Leave your answer as a mixed number").

For a Year 9 student, the arithmetic here is intentionally "easy" because the denominators are common. The difficulty lies entirely in avoiding the common trap of adding denominators or failing to read the final instruction.

### DIFFICULTY: 3/10
In the context of the Year 9 curriculum (ages 13–14), this is considered a foundational skill. It ranks higher than simple addition but significantly lower than algebraic manipulation. It is a "high confidence, high error" question for lower-attaining students.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**below_basic (Working below age expectations / Foundation Tier lower end)**
*   **A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%**
*   *Rationale:* These students often intuitively add across the bottom ($5+5=10$), leading them to D. Some will see "Mixed Number" and gravitate towards A, but many will fall for the "add everything" misconception.

**basic (Working at age expectations / Grade 3-4 target)**
*   **A=75% B=10% C=5% D=10%**
*   *Rationale:* Most students at this level know to add the whole numbers and the numerators while keeping the denominator the same. A few will still lapse into adding denominators (D) under time pressure.

**proficient (Secure knowledge / Grade 5-6 target)**
*   **A=90% B=8% C=1% D=1%**
*   *Rationale:* These students find the calculation trivial. The only "wrong" answer they are likely to provide is B, usually because they converted to improper fractions to solve it and forgot to convert back to a mixed number as instructed.

**advanced (High achievers / Grade 7+ target)**
*   **A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%**
*   *Rationale:* Mastery is expected here. The only errors would be "silly mistakes" or misreading the instruction (B).

### Teacher's Analysis of Misconceptions:
*   **Option D (The "Add Across" Trap):** This is the classic fraction misconception. Students who treat numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers will confidently choose this.
*   **Option B (The "Instruction Ignore"):** Mathematically identical to A, but "incorrect" based on the prompt's constraint. This identifies students who are procedural "calculators" rather than "readers."
*   **Option C (The Multi-Error):** This attracts students who both add denominators and multiply/confuse the whole numbers.
