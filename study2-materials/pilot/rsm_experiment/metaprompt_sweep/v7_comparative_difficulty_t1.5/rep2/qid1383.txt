As a UK maths teacher, I find this specific question fascinating because it perfectly targets the "Order of Operations" and "Negative Number Powers" misconceptions that persist even into GCSE Higher Tier.

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**
While the calculation itself is simple (it’s just $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$), for a Year 9 student, the presence of the negative base combined with an even exponent is a high-level "trap." It isn't a 10/10 because there are no complex rearrangements or fractions, but it is certainly harder than solving a basic two-step equation.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Misconception Analysis:**
*   **The "-81" Trap (C):** This is the "High Misconception Activation" choice. Many students will type $-3^4$ into a non-scientific calculator or think $(-3) \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$. They often associate "negative in, negative out."
*   **The "12/-12" Trap (B/D):** This targets students who mistake powers for multiplication ($3 \times 4$).

| Category | A (81) | B (12) | C (-81) | D (-12) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 35% | 15% | 35% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 15% | 50% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 55% | 5% | 35% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 92% | 1% | 7% | 0% |

### **Teacher’s Commentary**

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level almost always default to multiplication. They see a 3 and a 4 and produce a 12. The choice between B and D is essentially a coin flip for them regarding the sign.
*   **Basic:** These students understand what an index is, but they lack "operational fluency" with negatives. This is the group most likely to get the question **confidently wrong**. They will calculate $3^4 = 81$ and then simply re-attach the negative sign because they believe the negative "stays" unless there's a reason for it to go away.
*   **Proficient:** These are your solid Grade 4/5 students. They know that a negative times a negative is a positive, but some will still trip up on the fourth power, losing track of the signs halfway through. They are often saved by remembering the rule: "Even power = positive result."
*   **Advanced:** These students recognise the trap immediately. They have been taught to use brackets when substituting: $T = (-3)^4$. They will likely be the only group where Option A is the overwhelming majority.
