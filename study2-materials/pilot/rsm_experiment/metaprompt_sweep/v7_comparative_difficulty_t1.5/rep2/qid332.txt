As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it moves away from procedural "solving" and into the realm of **mathematical reasoning** and **order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)**.

### Difficulty Rating: 6.5/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this is harder than actually solving the equation. Most Year 9 students are trained in a specific "step-by-step" procedure (usually adding 5 first). When presented with Katie's method, which requires multiplying every term by the denominator, many students lack the conceptual depth to recognise it as a valid (though rarer) algebraic move.

### The Pedagogy behind the Distractors
*   **Tom’s method** is the standard "inverse operations" approach ($+5$ to both sides). Most students will recognise this immediately.
*   **Katie’s method** tests a common misconception. To multiply by 3, you must multiply the **entire** side, not just the fraction. Many students mistakenly think you can "cancel" the 3 without touching the 5. Because Katie has failed to multiply the 5 by 3 (it should be $x - 15 = 36$), her working is **incorrect**.

**The Answer is A: Only Tom.**

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working at KS3 Stage 3/4):**
These students often struggle with fractions. They see the "36" in Katie's answer and assume she must be right because $12 \times 3 = 36$. They often guess "Both" because they believe there’s always more than one way to do things in maths, even if they can't follow the logic.
*   **A: 20% | B: 15% | C: 60% | D: 5%**

**Basic (GCSE Grade 2/3 equivalent):**
These students are comfortable adding 5 to 12. They will confidently identify Tom as correct. However, they are easily seduced by Katie’s 36. They often fail to notice the $-5$ hasn't been changed.
*   **A: 40% | B: 10% | C: 45% | D: 5%**

**Proficient (GCSE Grade 5/6 equivalent):**
This group is the "sweet spot" for the misconception. They know you can multiply by the denominator to "get rid of it." Because they often make the mistake of forgetting to multiply the non-fraction term themselves in their own work, they validate Katie’s mistake as a "correct rule."
*   **A: 55% | B: 5% | C: 35% | D: 5%**

**Advanced (GCSE Grade 7+ equivalent):**
These students have a high level of algebraic fluency. They will look at Katie's line and immediately spot the missing distribution (the $-15$). They understand that an equation is a balance and that multiplying one side by 3 requires multiplying the *entire* expression.
*   **A: 90% | B: 2% | C: 5% | D: 3%**

### Teacher's Summary
This is a high "misconception activation" question. Students won't guess randomly; they will **confidently** choose **C** because they recognize the components of the inverse operations ($+5$ and $\times3$) but haven't mastered the priority of operations when rearranging. Expect heated debates in the classroom!
