This question is a classic "trap" that tests **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)**. For a Year 9 student, it targets a fundamental misconception regarding the distributive property and the hierarchy of operations.

### **DIFFICULTY: 4/10**

While the arithmetic is simple (Year 4/5 level), the "Difficulty 4" rating reflects the high **misconception activation**. Many students are overconfident in their mental math but fail to apply BIDMAS rigorously when a calculation "looks" like it should be equal.

**The Math:**
*   **Left Side:** $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$
*   **Right Side:** $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$
*   **Answer:** $11 > 5$ (A)

**The Misconception:**
Students often see the same numbers and operators on both sides and instinctively assume they are equal (Option C). They ignore the bracket's impact on the order of addition and division, assuming that because $8+12 \div 4$ *contains* $8+12$, the brackets are just "extra."

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Below Basic (Working below Age Related Expectations):**
*These students often calculate left-to-right or guess based on the visual "balance" of the equation.*
*   **A=15% | B=15% | C=65% | D=5%**
*   *Rationale:* High "confidence in error" for C. They see $8+12$ and $4$ on both sides and assume equality.

**Basic (Working at Year 7-8 level):**
*They know BIDMAS exists but often apply it inconsistently or forget that division happens before addition on the left side.*
*   **A=35% | B=10% | C=50% | D=5%**
*   *Rationale:* Many will still fall for the visual symmetry (C), but some will perform the calculation and find the correct answer.

**Proficient (Working at Year 9 standard):**
*These students are wary of "trick" questions and will usually take 10 seconds to calculate both sides separately.*
*   **A=75% | B=5% | C=15% | D=5%**
*   *Rationale:* Most will correctly identify that the left side is 11 and the right is 5. C remains a "careless mistake" for those rushing.

**Advanced (GCSE Higher tier candidates):**
*These students see the structure immediately. They recognize that brackets change the order of operations.*
*   **A=95% | B=1% | C=3% | D=1%**
*   *Rationale:* Near-total accuracy. Any errors are purely due to extreme rushing.
