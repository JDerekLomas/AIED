As an experienced UK maths teacher, I would place this question firmly in the "confidence without competence" category for Year 9 students. This is a classic diagnostic question that tests whether a student has internalised the concept of equivalent fractions or is merely following "eye-ball" heuristics.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 class (approx. age 13-14), this is a mid-tier challenge. It sits below completing the square because it doesn't require a multi-step rearrangement, but it is significantly harder than adding fractions with common denominators because it triggers the most common algebraic misconception: adding the "bottoms."

### Misconception Profile:
*   **The "Add Across" Trap:** Students see $3+4$ and $2x+x$. They instinctively want to reach for Option B ($7/3x$). This is a "confident wrong" answer.
*   **The "Double the Top only" Trap:** Students recognize they need a common denominator of $2x$, but they forget to multiply the numerator of the second fraction. This leads them to Option D ($7/2x$).
*   **The Correct Logic:** Multiply $4/x$ by $2/2$ to get $8/2x$. Then $3/2x + 8/2x = 11/2x$ (Option A).

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working below age expectations):**
These students likely struggle with standard numerical fractions. They will treat the algebra as a distraction and simply add the numbers they see.
*   **A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%**
*   *Note: Heavy leaning towards B because "3+4=7" and "2x+x=3x" feels intuitively right to them.*

**Basic (Working at age expectations - Foundation Tier):**
These students know you shouldn't add the denominators, but their algebraic manipulation is shaky. They are likely to remember the denominator stays the same, but they won't know *which* denominator to pick.
*   **A=25% B=30% C=5% D=40%**
*   *Note: High D distribution here; they see 2x as the 'target', but forget to balance the second fraction's numerator.*

**Proficient (Secure in Higher Tier curriculum):**
These students understand common denominators and the need for equivalence. Most will get it right, but a significant minority will make a "careless" error by adding 3 and 4 instead of 3 and 8.
*   **A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%**
*   *Note: Most reach the correct answer, but the "7" in Option D remains a very strong distractor for those rushing.*

**Advanced (Top Set / G&T):**
These students have mastered algebraic fractions and usually perform a "cross-multiplication" or "balancing" method mentally without error.
*   **A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%**
*   *Note: Errors here are purely down to misreading the question.*
