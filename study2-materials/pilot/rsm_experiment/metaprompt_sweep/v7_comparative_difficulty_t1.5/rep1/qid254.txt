As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it doesn't test the **process** of addition; it tests **conceptual precision** regarding the role of zero and the order of operations ($BIDMAS$).

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
For a Year 9 class, this is harder than it looks. While the "maths" is easy, the question is designed to trigger two major misconceptions: 
1. **The "Zero doesn't count" fallacy:** Students often subconsciously treat zero as "nothing," leading them to believe it doesn't affect the divisor ($n$).
2. **The "Calculator linear entry" error:** Students often forget that a fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol.

### Response Distributions

| Group | A | B | C | D | Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | **45%** | 35% | 10% | These students focus on the "plus" and "divide" symbols. Many will choose **B** because it "looks" like how they type it into a cheap calculator, or **C** because they ignore the zero entirely. |
| **Basic** | **45%** | 20% | 25% | 10% | This group knows the zero must be included in the count ($n=5$), so they look for a denominator of 5. However, they lack the rigor to notice the $0+$ is missing in the numerator of **A**. |
| **Proficient** | **65%** | 5% | 10% | 20% | Most will pick **A** confidently, thinking they are clever for spotting $n=5$. They assume $0+$ is irrelevant to the sum. They are "confidently wrong." |
| **Advanced** | 20% | 0% | 0% | **80%** | Advanced students will spot the "trick." They know **A** is mathematically equivalent in value but technically incomplete as a "calculation of the mean," and crucially, they see that **B** fails $BIDMAS$ (only $7 \div 5$ happens). They correctly identify **D**. |

### Teacher’s Post-Mortem:
*   **The Trap in A:** Strictly speaking, $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ equals $3$, which *is* the mean. However, many teachers argue that to "calculate the mean," the 0 should be represented. More importantly, many students pick A for the wrong reason (they think the numerator is 15 and 15/5 is 3).
*   **The Trap in B:** This is the "BODMAS" trap. Without brackets, this calculation is $15.4$, not $3$.
*   **The Trap in C:** This is the most common conceptual error—excluding zero from the count of items.

**Correct Answer:** **A** is mathematically equivalent to the correct value ($15/5$), but in a strict multiple-choice environment designed by a "tricky" examiner, **D** is often the intended answer because A omits an element of the set and B lacks brackets. However, in a standard UK classroom, **A** would be the "distractor-heavy" correct-value choice. For this prediction, I have treated **A** as the "correct-looking" answer that most will gravitate towards, while the most mathematically rigorous students will pivot to **D**.
