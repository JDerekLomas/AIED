As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it moves away from standard procedural calculation and into **conceptual understanding of inverse operations**.

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
For a Year 9 student, the actual solving of $x/3 - 5 = 12$ is about a 4/10. However, this specific question format is more difficult (6/10) because it targets a common **procedural misconception**. Students are often taught to "do the same to both sides," but many fail to apply that to *every term* when multiplying.

*   **Tom** is correct (+5 to both sides).
*   **Katie** is incorrect (she multiplied $x/3$ and $12$ by 3, but forgot to multiply the $-5$).

This is a classic "high misconception activation" question. Students who rely on "moving numbers across the equals sign" rather than balanced operations will likely fall for Katie’s logic.

### Predicted Response Distributions

I have categorised the groups based on typical UK Year 9 attainment levels (Working Towards, Working At, and Working Above Age Related Expectations).

#### **Below Basic (Lower Tier / Set 4-5)**
*Students at this level often struggle with the order of operations and "clear" denominators first without adjusting the constant.*
*   **A (Only Tom): 20%**
*   **B (Only Katie): 30%**
*   **C (Both): 40%** (Many assume that because they see "legal" numbers, both must be right)
*   **D (Neither): 10%**

#### **Basic (Mid-Low Tier / Set 3-4)**
*This group has a high "Confidence in Error." They have learned that you can multiply by the denominator to "get rid of the fraction," and Katie's line looks "cleaner" to them.*
*   **A (Only Tom): 35%**
*   **B (Only Katie): 25%**
*   **C (Both): 35%**
*   **D (Neither): 5%**

#### **Proficient (Mid-High Tier / Set 2)**
*These students are starting to understand balancing. Most will recognise Tom is correct, but a significant portion will still see Katie’s move as a "valid alternative method" because they don't check the distribution of the 3.*
*   **A (Only Tom): 65%**
*   **B (Only Katie): 5%**
*   **C (Both): 25%**
*   **D (Neither): 5%**

#### **Advanced (Higher Tier / Set 1 / Top 10%)**
*These students understand that multiplication must be applied to the entire side of the equation. They will spot Katie's error immediately.*
*   **A (Only Tom): 92%**
*   **B (Only Katie): 1%**
*   **C (Both): 5%**
*   **D (Neither): 2%**

### Teacher's Note:
The "Both" (C) distractor is the most dangerous one here. In a Year 9 classroom, you will often hear a student say, "I did it Tom's way and got the answer, but Katie's way looks like it works too." This question is excellent for sparking a classroom discussion on **equivalence** versus **selective arithmetic**.
