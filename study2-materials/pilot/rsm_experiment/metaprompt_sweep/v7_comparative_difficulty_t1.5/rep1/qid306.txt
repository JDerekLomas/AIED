As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it highlights the "Order of Operations" trap that plagues students well into GCSE level.

### Difficulty Rating: 4/10

While the arithmetic is Year 4 level, the conceptual understanding of **associativity** versus **hierarchy** is a major hurdle. 
*   **Problem Q** tests hierarchy (Multiplication before Addition). Most Year 9s know BIDMAS/BODMAS well enough to get this.
*   **Problem P** tests left-to-right associativity. This is the "hidden" rule of BIDMAS. Because Addition and Subtraction have equal priority, you must work left-to-right. However, many students take the "A" before "S" in BIDMAS literally, leading them to believe addition must *always* come first.

This is a classic "confident misconception" question.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to the options:**
*   **A:** Left-to-right for both (Wrong hierarchy for Q)
*   **B: Correct Answer** (Left-to-right for P, hierarchy for Q)
*   **C:** "A before S" literalism for P, wrong hierarchy for Q
*   **D:** "A before S" literalism for P, correct hierarchy for Q (The most common trap)

#### Below Basic (Working towards Year 7 targets)
*Students here often lack a firm grasp of BIDMAS and tend to work strictly left-to-right, treating math like reading a sentence.*
**A=45% B=15% C=10% D=30%**

#### Basic (Achieving Year 7/8 targets)
*These students know "Multiplication before Addition" but are highly susceptible to the "A before S" trap in BIDMAS.*
**A=10% B=25% C=5% D=60%**

#### Proficient (On track for Grade 4/5 at GCSE)
*Students are beginning to understand that +/- are a "pair," but under pressure, the literal mnemonic (BIDMAS) still exerts a strong pull.*
**A=5% B=60% C=0% D=35%**

#### Advanced (On track for Grade 7+ at GCSE)
*These students recognize that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and that the question is a deliberate probe for that specific misconception.*
**A=2% B=92% C=0% D=6%**

### Teacher's Note:
The "D" response is the most dangerous. In a typical Year 9 classroom, you will see a "Split Class" between B and D. Students who choose D will argue passionately that "A comes before S in the word BIDMAS," making this an excellent "diagnostic question" to trigger a classroom discussion on the equal status of Inverse Operations.
