This is a classic "inverse relationship" problem that exposes how students handle variables in the denominator. Many Year 9 students rely on a "see two numbers, do an operation" heuristic rather than algebraic manipulation.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the numbers are small, the cognitive load is surprisingly high. In a Year 9 context, solving for a denominator is significantly harder than solving $5p = 10$ or $p/5 = 10$. This falls into the "confident but wrong" category.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working at Year 6/7 level)**
These students look at 10 and 5 and immediately multiply them because they see a fraction and assume the inverse is multiplication. They rarely check if their answer makes sense when plugged back in.
*   **A=10% | B=70% | C=10% | D=10%**

**Basic (Working at Year 8 level)**
These students know a division is involved. However, they almost always perform "Big Number divided by Small Number" regardless of the algebra. $10 \div 5 = 2$ is a very strong distractor for this group.
*   **A=15% | B=15% | C=65% | D=5%**

**Proficient (Secure Year 9)**
These students recognize that $p$ cannot be 2 (because $5/2$ is $2.5$). They either use a "triangle" method or multiply both sides by $p$ to get $10p = 5$. Some might still slip and say $10 \div 5 = 0.5$ by accident, but most will correctly identify $5 \div 10$.
*   **A=75% | B=5% | C=18% | D=2%**

**Advanced (GCSE Foundation/Higher target)**
These students see the structure immediately. They treat it as a reciprocal or a simple rearrangement. If they make an error, it's a "clerical" one, but it's rare.
*   **A=95% | B=1% | C=3% | D=1%**

### Teacher's Note: The "Trap"
Option **C** is the "Confidence Trap." A student who calculates $10 \div 5 = 2$ feels they have done "maths" and will select it without checking the logic. Option **B** is the "Procedure Trap" where students remember "to get rid of the bottom, you multiply," but they multiply the 10 and the 5. 

Success on this question relies on the student's ability to divide the divisor by the quotient, a concept that remains counter-intuitive for many until the end of Key Stage 3.
