As a UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because it touches on **implicit linear equations**, which Year 9 students often find much trickier than the standard $y = mx + c$ format.

### **Difficulty Rating: 6/10**
While the arithmetic involved is simple, the "cognitive load" is high for a Year 9 student. They are accustomed to tables where the $x$ value is plugged into a formula to get $y$. Here, the equation is not "solved for $y$," requiring either algebraic manipulation (rearranging) or the substitution and solving of a one-step/two-step equation.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Misconception Analysis:**
*   **The "4+1=5" Distractor (Option C):** This is a classic "high confidence, wrong answer" trap. Students see $x=0$, ignore the $4x$ entirely, and assume $2y=10$ or even just see the numbers 4, 2, and 10 and guess 5 because $10 \div 2 = 5$.
*   **The "Random Operations" (Option A):** Students who are overwhelmed often multiply everything ($4 \times 0 + 2 \times 10$ or $2 \times 10$).
*   **The "Gradient Trap" (Option D):** $10 \div 4 = 2.5$. Students often try to divide the constant by the coefficient of $x$.

| Student Level | A (20) | B (5) | C (5) | D (2.5) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 25% | 15% | 45% | 15% |
| **Basic** | 10% | 40% | 35% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 5% | 80% | 10% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 0% | 98% | 2% | 0% |

### **Teacher’s Commentary**

*   **Below Basic:** These students will suffer from "Number Grab Syndrome." They see 10 and 2, and they choose 5 (Option C) almost instantly without considering the $x=0$ substitution. Option A is also a strong distractor for those who just want to do "something" with the numbers provided.
*   **Basic:** This group is the most likely to fall into the **B vs C trap**. They understand they need to do something with $x=0$, but they might incorrectly conclude that $y$ must be 5 because $10 \div 2 = 5$ (which is actually correct) but then second-guess themselves or get confused by the 4. However, many will successfully compute $2y=10 \rightarrow y=5$. *Wait—re-evaluating: If $x=0$, $4(0) + 2y = 10$, so $2y = 10$, $y=5$. Option C is actually the correct answer.* 

**Correction on Logic:** 
Actually, looking at the math:
If $x = 0$: 
$4(0) + 2y = 10$
$0 + 2y = 10$
$y = 5$. 

**The real "Trap" is B (3).** In many Year 9 problems, the answer is a "nice" small integer like 3. A student might try to rearrange to $y = -2x + 5$ and make an error, or they might look at the table and assume a pattern. If the table had $x=1$, then $y=3$. Students often solve for the "next" box instead of the $x=0$ box.

**Revised Prediction (Correct Answer is C):**
*   **Below Basic:** Often pick **A** (multiplication).
*   **Basic:** Confidently pick **C** (correctly calculating $10 \div 2$).
*   **Proficient:** Pick **C** easily.
*   **Advanced:** Pick **C** instantly. 

This question is actually "easier" than it looks because $x=0$ eliminates the hardest part of the equation ($4x$). If the star were under $x=1$ or $x=2$, the difficulty would jump to an 8/10.
