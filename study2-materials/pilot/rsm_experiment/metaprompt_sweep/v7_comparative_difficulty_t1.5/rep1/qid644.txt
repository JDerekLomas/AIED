As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in Year 9 assessments (SATS-style or GCSE foundation preparation). It is a classic "trap" question that targets **operational signs** rather than the process of algebraic expansion itself.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
While the actual calculation is simple arithmetic, the context of "expanding brackets" adds cognitive load. For a Year 9 student, the challenge isn't the multiplication; it's the ability to correctly identify that the sign belongs to the term.

### Analysis of Student Thinking
This is a **high misconception activation** question.
*   **The Multiplier/Adder Confusion:** Students often see $(-1)$ and $(-4)$ and their brain defaults to addition ($-1 - 4 = -5$ or $1+4=5$) because they are used to combining terms at the end of an expansion.
*   **The Sign Neglect:** Students often ignore the negatives entirely, do $1 \times 4 = 4$, and then guess the sign based on "vibes" (often thinking two negatives must stay negative).

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic**
*These students struggle with directed numbers and often confuse the operation required when they see brackets.*
*   **A (+4): 20%**
*   **B (-4): 25%**
*   **C (+5): 15%**
*   **D (-5): 40%**
*   *Rationale:* High numbers will choose D because their instinct is to add the numbers they see.

**Basic**
*These students know "expand" means "multiply," but they are highly inconsistent with negative number rules.*
*   **A (+4): 35%**
*   **B (-4): 40%**
*   **C (+5): 5%**
*   **D (-5): 20%**
*   *Rationale:* They know to multiply ($1 \times 4$), but many believe a "negative and a negative make a negative" (a common linguistic confusion with "a negative plus a negative").

**Proficient**
*These students have mastered the FOIL or Grid method and are comfortable with directed numbers.*
*   **A (+4): 80%**
*   **B (-4): 10%**
*   **C (+5): 2%**
*   **D (-5): 8%**
*   *Rationale:* Most get it right. Errors come from "careless" slips where they perform the multiplication correctly but carry a negative sign over from the middle terms of a typical expansion.

**Advanced**
*These students identify the "trick" immediately.*
*   **A (+4): 98%**
*   **B (-4): 1%**
*   **C (+5): 0%**
*   **D (-5): 1%**
*   *Rationale:* Near-perfect accuracy; any errors are likely misclicks/bubbles.

### Teacher's Note
The most common "Confident Wrong Answer" here is **B** or **D**. Option D is the "additive" trap, and Option B is the "sign-blindness" trap. In a Year 9 classroom, I would use this question as a "starter" to highlight the importance of circling the sign with the number before starting a grid expansion.
