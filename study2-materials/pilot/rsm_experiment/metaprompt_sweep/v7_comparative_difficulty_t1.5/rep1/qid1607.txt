This is a classic "lure" question that tests structural understanding of inverse operations. For a Year 9 student, this falls into the category of a **high-misconception question.**

Students often perform the correct operation (multiplying or subtracting) but apply it to the wrong side of the equals sign or fail to maintain the balance of the equation.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
While the algebra itself is simple, the "trap" in Step 2 is highly effective. It is significantly easier than completing the square, but it catches students who are working on autopilot rather than checking their logic.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic:** Students at this level often struggle with fractions in equations. They may see "divide by 4" and "add 1" and just combine numbers randomly, or they might think Isaac must be right because "it looks like maths."
*   **A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%**
*   *Reasoning:* High selection of **C** because they trust the process shown and don't physically check the arithmetic.

**Basic:** These students understand that multiplying by 4 is the first step (recognising Step 1 is correct). However, they frequently make the "additive inverse error"—seeing a $+1$ and instinctively adding 1 to the other side instead of subtracting.
*   **A=30% B=10% C=50% D=10%**
*   *Reasoning:* This is the peak of the misconception. They "verify" Step 1, see $60$ and $1$ and think "61 makes sense," leading them to confidently choose **C**.

**Proficient:** Students at this level are starting to internalise that $+1$ requires a $-1$ to solve. They will spot the error in Step 2.
*   **A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%**
*   *Reasoning:* Most will correctly identify **A**. A small minority might overthink the fraction in the initial setup and suspect Step 1 is wrong, but the vast majority will identify the sign error in Step 2.

**Advanced:** These students will solve the equation mentally before looking at the steps ($60 - 1 = 59$).
*   **A=95% B=0% C=2% D=3%**
*   *Reasoning:* Near-total accuracy. They immediately see that $60 = 1 + k$ must lead to $k = 59$.

### Teacher's Note on Misconception Activation:
This is a **High Misconception** question. Students rarely guess randomly here; they "confidently get it wrong." The jump from $60 = 1 + k$ to $61 = k$ is a very common "reflex error" where the brain sees the $60$ and the $1$ and performs the easiest operation (addition) regardless of the equals sign.
