As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. On the surface, it’s a simple substitution. In reality, it is a "landmine" question that tests decimal place value, the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS), and the common misconception regarding squaring decimals.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a Year 9 student, the arithmetic is significantly harder than the algebraic concept. While they know $y = 3x^2$ means "square it, then triple it," the decimal $0.3$ creates high cognitive load. This is a classic "high misconception" question; students will choose an incorrect answer with high confidence.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**The Distractors:**
*   **A (0.81):** The "Order of Operations" error. The student multiplies $3 \times 0.3$ first to get $0.9$, then squares $0.9$.
*   **C (1.8):** The "Linear Thinking" error. The student doubles $0.3$ instead of squaring it, then multiplies by $3$ (or simply calculates $3 \times 0.6$).
*   **D (2.7):** The "Place Value" error. The student correctly squares $0.3$ but thinks it is $0.9$ (instead of $0.09$), then triples it.

| Group | A (0.81) | B (0.27) | C (1.8) | D (2.7) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 10% | 40% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 35% | 20% | 10% | 35% |
| **Proficient** | 20% | 45% | 5% | 30% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | 85% | 0% | 10% |

### Teacher's Analysis:

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the $x^2$ notation, frequently treating it as $x \times 2$. They will gravitate towards **C**, seeing numbers they recognize from the 3 and 6 times tables.
*   **Basic:** This is the most dangerous zone. These students know BIDMAS (square first), but they possess the "decimals make things smaller" confusion. They will calculate $0.3 \times 0.3$ as $0.9$. This leads them directly to **D**, which feels like a "correct" looking answer.
*   **Proficient:** Many will fall into the trap of **A** if they are rushing. They do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then square it. Only those who are disciplined with their written workings will consistently hit **B**.
*   **Advanced:** Most will correctly identify $0.3^2 = 0.09$ and $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. Their only likely error is a "slip" into answer D if they do it entirely mentally and lose track of the decimal place.
