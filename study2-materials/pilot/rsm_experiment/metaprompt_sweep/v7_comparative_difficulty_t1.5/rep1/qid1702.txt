As a UK maths teacher, I’ve seen this exact type of question trip up many Year 9 students. This falls into the "trap" category of questions because it looks simpler than it is, leading to high confidence in incorrect answers.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a Year 9 student, this is more challenging than a standard "find $y$ when $x$ is 2" question. It requires three distinct steps: **substitution** of a decimal, **rearranging** an equation with a negative coefficient, and **dividing** by 10. 

The "Difficulty 6" comes from the negative $y$ term ($-6y$) and the fact that they are solving for $x$, which is usually the "input," not the "output."

### PREDICTED RESPONSE DISTRIBUTIONS

**Calculations behind the distractors:**
*   **The Correct Answer (C):** $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$.
*   **The "Sign Error" Distractor (D):** $10x + 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 27 \Rightarrow x = 2.7$. (Student adds $6y$ instead of subtracting, or misinterprets the negative).
*   **The "Reversed Variables" Distractor (A):** $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y = -4.16$ (rounded to $4.25$ or similar confusion). Many students plug the given number into $x$ regardless of the table.

| Group | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 45% | 10% | 15% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 5% | 35% | 35% |
| **Proficient** | 10% | 5% | 70% | 15% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 1% | 95% | 2% |

### Teacher’s Commentary:
*   **Below Basic:** These students rarely look at the table labels. They see $0.5$ and the equation and immediately do $10 \times 0.5$. This leads them to Answer A or something similar. They are "confidently wrong."
*   **Basic:** This group recognizes they need to substitute $y$, but the negative sign in $-6y$ is a huge hurdle. They often calculate $10x - 3 = 30$ but then instinctively subtract the $3$ from $30$ because they see the minus sign and think of "inverse operations" poorly, leading to $27$ and then Answer D.
*   **Proficient:** These students handle the substitution and the two-step equation correctly. The decimal $0.5$ is friendly enough that they don't lose their way.
*   **Advanced:** This is a "10-second question" for them. The only risk is a "silly" arithmetic error, which is rare.

**Verdict:** This question has high **misconception activation**. Option D is a very "sticky" distractor for Year 9s who are still shaky on their directed numbers and linear rearrangements.
