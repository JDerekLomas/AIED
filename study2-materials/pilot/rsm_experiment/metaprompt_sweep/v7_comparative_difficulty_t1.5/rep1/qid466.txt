This is a classic "trap" question that tests two distinct conceptual hurdles: the **multiplicative inverse** and **integer signs**.

For a Year 9 student, the challenge isn't the arithmetic; it’s the "cognitive load" of managing the negative sign while simultaneously remembering the rule for flipping a fraction. This is a high-misconception question rather than a guessing question.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the operation is simple multiplication, the presence of the negative result combined with a negative coefficient creates a "sign blindness" effect. Many students will focus on the fraction flip and forget to balance the negative, or vice versa.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working towards Grade 2-3):**
These students often focus on "matching" or "reversing" without full conceptual understanding. They often see the negative in the question and assume the answer must be negative too (Option B), or they simply want to "cancel out" the numbers they see (Option C).
*   **A=15% B=40% C=35% D=10%**

**Basic (Working at Grade 4):**
These students know the "reciprocal" rule but are highly susceptible to the "Double Negative" misconception. They see a negative in the question and a negative in the answer and think "one negative makes a negative," missing that $(- \times + = -)$. They are most likely to confidently choose the wrong sign.
*   **A=30% B=55% C=10% D=5%**

**Proficient (Working at Grade 5-6):**
These students have mastered the mechanics of fractions. They know they need the reciprocal to get 1. They are much more likely to check the sign. However, under pressure, about a third will still make the "intuitive" error of keeping the sign negative.
*   **A=65% B=30% C=3% D=2%**

**Advanced (Working at Grade 7-9):**
These students will immediately identify the need for the reciprocal and perform a mental "sign check": *Negative times what equals negative? A positive.*
*   **A=92% B=7% C=0% D=1%**

### Teacher's Note: The "Confidently Wrong" Factor
The most common wrong answer will be **B**. 

Students are taught that the reciprocal of $2$ is $1/2$ and the reciprocal of $3/4$ is $4/3$. Because they see a minus sign in the question, their "pattern matching" brain often drags that minus sign along to the answer. They correctly identify the numerical inverse but fail the logic of the sign multiplication $(- \times - = +)$, forgetting that to keep a result negative, the second factor **must** be positive.
