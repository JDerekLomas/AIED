As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question through the lens of **Algebraic Notation and Convention**, a core part of the KS3 curriculum. 

While the concept seems simple to an expert, students in Year 9 often struggle with the "visual grammar" of algebra—specifically how a vinculum (fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol that replaces parentheses.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this is a "lower-intermediate" difficulty. It doesn't require calculation, but it tests the structural understanding of BODMAS/BIDMAS within algebra. It is a high-misconception question rather than a "random guess" question; students who get it wrong usually do so because they misunderstand the "order" of the division or the "packaging" of the $h+4$.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working toward Level 3/4):**
These students often struggle with the left-to-right order of division and don't realise that the denominator is a single block.
*   **A=40%** | **B=10%** | **C=20%** | **D=30%**
*   *Analysis:* A high number will flip the fraction (Option D) because they associate the "bigger" expression with the numerator, or they choose Option C because they see "$+4$" at the end of the original expression and want to see it at the end of the new one.

**Basic (Working at Level 5):**
These students know that division becomes a fraction, but are prone to "notational interference."
*   **A=65%** | **B=5%** | **C=15%** | **D=15%**
*   *Analysis:* Most will correctly identify A, but a significant minority will be lured by C if they haven't internalised that the fraction bar groups the $h+4$.

**Proficient (Working at Level 6/GCSE Grade 4-5):**
These students have mastered the transition from arithmetic notation to algebraic notation.
*   **A=90%** | **B=2%** | **C=5%** | **D=3%**
*   *Analysis:* High success rate. Errors here are usually due to "skimming" and accidentally selecting D (the reciprocal) by moving too fast.

**Advanced (Working at Level 7+ / GCSE Grade 7-9):**
*   **A=98%** | **B=0%** | **C=1%** | **D=1%**
*   *Analysis:* Near-total mastery. This is a 5-second question for them.

### Teacher's Note: The "Confidently Wrong" Factor
The most dangerous distractor here is **D**. In my experience, a surprising number of students in Year 9 still struggle with the "order" of division (the *Dividend* vs the *Divisor*). Because "$h+4$" is physically longer than "$c$", their brain instinctively wants to put the "heavier" part on the bottom of the fraction, which happens to be correct here, but if the question were $(h+4) \div c$, many would still choose A because it "looks" more balanced.
