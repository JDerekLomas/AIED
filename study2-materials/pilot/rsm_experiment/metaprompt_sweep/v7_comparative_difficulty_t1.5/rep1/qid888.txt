This is a classic "bread and butter" GCSE-prep question. For a typical Year 9 student, expanding double brackets is a core skill usually taught early in the year.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10

While the concept is straightforward, this specific question is designed as a "trap" regarding directed numbers (negatives). It isn't a difficulty 10 because there are no coefficients in front of the $m$ terms, but it is a "confident mistake" hotspot.

**The Misconception Profile:**
The primary "distractor" here is the interaction of negative signs.
*   **The Middle Term:** Students often correctly add $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$.
*   **The Constant Term:** This is the "kill zone." Many students instinctively see the two minus signs and either forget to multiply them correctly or apply "addition rules" to multiplication.
*   **The "Half-Right" Error:** Students often get $-12m$ but then write $-35$ because they think "a negative and a negative stay negative."

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working towards Grade 2-3)**
*Students here often struggle with the "FOIL" or Grid method steps and have very weak grasp of negative number rules.*
**A=40% B=15% C=10% D=35%**
*Reasoning: Many will simply subtract 5 from 7 to get "2" (Option A) or perform $-5 \times -7$ and conclude it must be negative (Option D).*

**Basic (Working at Grade 4)**
*Students know the method (Grid/FOIL) but are highly prone to sign errors under pressure.*
**A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%**
*Reasoning: They correctly identify the 12, but D is a massive magnet for students who believe "negative times a negative equals a negative" or who simply lose track of the final step.*

**Proficient (Working at Grade 5-6)**
*Students have automated the process and generally remember that $- \times - = +$.*
**A=2% B=85% C=5% D=8%**
*Reasoning: Most will get it right. Option D remains the only significant distractor for those working too quickly.*

**Advanced (Working at Grade 7+)**
*High-flyers see this as a 5-second task.*
**A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%**
*Reasoning: Errors here are almost exclusively "slips" or misreads of the options rather than conceptual failings.*
