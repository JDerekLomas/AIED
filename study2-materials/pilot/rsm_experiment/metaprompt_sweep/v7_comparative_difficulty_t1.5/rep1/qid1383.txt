As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it perfectly captures the transition from procedural fluency to conceptual mastery of indices and negatives.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 student (age 13-14), this is a "danger zone" question. While it appears simple, it targets a major misconception regarding the **even power of a negative number**. It is significantly more difficult than \(2+3\), but slightly more accessible than completing the square because the calculation itself is short. However, it has a high "misconception activation" rate.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Terminology breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** Struggling with basic arithmetic and order of operations.
*   **Basic:** Can substitute and knows $3^4$, but ignores sign rules.
*   **Proficient:** Understands negatives but is prone to "fast thinking" errors.
*   **Advanced:** Understands that $(-3)^4 = (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$.

| Group | A (81) | B (12) | C (-81) | D (-12) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 40% | 10% | 40% |
| **Basic** | 20% | 5% | 70% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 65% | 0% | 35% | 0% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 0% | 2% | 0% |

### Teacher's Commentary:

1.  **The "Linear" Trap (B & D):** Students in the **Below Basic** tier often default to multiplication when they see small superscripts ($3 \times 4$). They see the '3' and the '4' and gravitate toward 12 or -12.
2.  **The "Negative Preservation" Misconception (C):** This is the most common error for **Basic and Proficient** students. There is a deeply ingrained (and incorrect) "rule" in many students' heads that "if the question starts with a negative, the answer must stay negative."
3.  **The Calculator Effect:** If this were on a calculator paper, many students would type $-3^4$ into a scientific calculator. Without brackets, the calculator correctly follows BIDMAS and outputs **-81**. This reinforces the misconception for the "Proficient" students who are clever enough to use a tool but not yet wise enough to know the tool's syntax requirements.
4.  **Confident Error:** This is a classic "confident wrong" question. Students choosing **C** will rarely second-guess themselves because $3^4$ is indeed 81, and they feel they are being "faithful" to the negative sign.
