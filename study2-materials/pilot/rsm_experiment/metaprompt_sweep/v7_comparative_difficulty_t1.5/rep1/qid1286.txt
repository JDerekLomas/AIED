This is a classic "subject-rearrangement" task embedded within a geometry context. For a Year 9 student, this represents a significant jump in cognitive load because it requires three distinct steps: recalling (or identifying) the volume formula, applying algebraic manipulation, and dealing with fractional/radical notation.

### DIFFICULTY: 8/10
While "solving a quadratic" is procedural, changing the subject of a formula involving fractions and powers is often more abstract for Year 9s. This specific question has high "misconception activation" regarding the placement of $\pi$ and the reciprocal of the fraction $4/3$.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working towards GCSE Grade 1-2):**
These students likely do not know the sphere volume formula and will choose based on "visual patterns." They often gravitate towards options where numbers look like they are in their "natural" order.
*   **A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%**
*   *Reasoning:* Choice A looks "correct" because $4\pi/3$ is the familiar cluster of symbols from the volume formula; they don't realize that multiplying by the reciprocal is necessary.

**Basic (Working towards GCSE Grade 3-4):**
These students know the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ but struggle with multi-step rearrangement. Many will move the $3$ correctly but forget to move the $\pi$ below the line, or they will panic at the cube root.
*   **A=30% B=25% C=30% D=15%**
*   *Reasoning:* High confusion between A and C. Many will correctly identify that a cube root is needed but will guess the arrangement of the constants.

**Proficient (Working towards GCSE Grade 5-6):**
These students are comfortable with the formula and know that "to get rid of a fraction, you multiply by the denominator." This leads them directly to $3V$. 
*   **A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%**
*   *Reasoning:* Most will successfully isolate $r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$. They are unlikely to choose D because the radical doesn't encompass the whole expression.

**Advanced (Working towards GCSE Grade 7+ / Higher Tier):**
These students treat this as a standard procedural task.
*   **A=2% B=3% C=95% D=0%**
*   *Reasoning:* The only errors here are likely "slips" or misreading the question. They will identify C almost instantly by mentally moving the $3$ up and the $4\pi$ down.

### Teacher's Note:
The "Distractor" in this question is exceptionally strong in Option **A**. Many students see the $4/3 \pi$ from the original formula and assume it stays as a "block" during the transition, rather than being inverted. Choice **D** acts as a filter for students who understand the algebra but don't understand how radical notation (the cube root bar) must extend over the entire denominator.
