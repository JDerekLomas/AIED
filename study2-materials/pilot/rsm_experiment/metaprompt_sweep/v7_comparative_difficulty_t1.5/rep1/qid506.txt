This is a classic "trap" question that identifies a specific developmental gap in algebraic manipulation—specifically the transition from "knowing the operation" to "executing it on fractions."

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10

While the equation appears simple (it is a one-step linear equation), for a Year 9 student, the fractional result combined with a common misconception makes it significantly harder than it looks. It sits at a 6 because, while it doesn't require complex multi-step rearrangement, it high-jacks the "intuitive" brain which wants to see the numbers 3 and 12 and produce a 4.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key Misconceptions:**
*   **The "Division by Instinct" Trap (Option A):** Students see 3 and 12 and immediately think $12 \div 3 = 4$. They keep the fraction structure, resulting in $1/4$.
*   **The "Whole Number" Bias (Option C):** Students ignore the fraction entirely and solve as if it were $p/3 = 12$ or simply believe $3 \times 4 = 12$.
*   **The Calculation Error (Option D):** Thinking they need to square or simply subtracting/adding incorrectly.

| Category | A ($1/4$) | B ($1/36$) | C ($4$) | D ($1/9$) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 45% | 10% | 35% | 10% |
| **Basic** | 55% | 25% | 15% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 20% | 75% | 3% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 97% | 1% | 0% |

### Teacher's Analysis:

*   **Below Basic:** These students operate on "number association." They see 3 and 12 and hunt for a relationship. Option C is very attractive because it's a whole number. Option A feels "maths-y" because it maintains the fraction.
*   **Basic:** This is the **High Misconception Zone**. These students know they need to divide by 3. However, their mental model of division is flawed. They perform $\frac{1}{12 \div 3}$ instead of $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$. They will confidently choose **A** and be surprised when it is wrong.
*   **Proficient:** These students have moved past the "3 and 12 make 4" reflex. They will write down $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$ or $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$. They understand that dividing a fraction makes the denominator larger (the pieces smaller).
*   **Advanced:** These students see the equation as a scaling exercise or use reciprocal multiplication instantly. They are unlikely to be tripped up by the numbers 3 and 12.

**Verdict:** This is an excellent "hinge question." If more than 30% of your class chooses A, you need to stop and re-teach dividing fractions by integers before moving on to complex algebraic fractions.
