As a UK maths teacher, I see this as a foundational Year 9 question, but one that contains several "traps" regarding the instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number and the common misconception of adding denominators.

### DIFFICULTY: 3/10
For a Year 9 student, the arithmetic itself is trivial (Difficulty 2). However, the inclusion of denominators and the specific formatting requirement ("Leave your answer as a mixed number") elevates the difficulty to a 3. It is a "high confidence, high error" question for lower-attaining students.

### PREDICTED RESPONSE DISTRIBUTIONS

**Below Basic (Working below Age Related Expectations)**
These students often apply "whole number logic" to fractions. Their biggest pitfall is adding the denominators ($5+5=10$). They will likely choose D because it looks like a "complete" addition of all four numbers present.
*   **A: 30%** (Recognise the whole numbers)
*   **B: 10%** (Rarely convert to improper fractions correctly)
*   **C: 20%** (Add everything across: $2+1=3$ (as 18/5?), but often just messy arithmetic)
*   **D: 40%** (The "Classic" misconception: add the tops, add the bottoms)

**Basic (Working at Age Related Expectations - Lower Tier)**
These students know how to add fractions but are easily distracted by improper fractions or may second-guess the denominator.
*   **A: 65%** (Get it right but feel it’s "too easy")
*   **B: 10%** (Correct value, but failed to read the "mixed number" instruction)
*   **C: 5%** (Careless errors)
*   **D: 20%** (Still prone to the "add the denominators" instinct under pressure)

**Proficient (Working at Age Related Expectations - Upper Tier)**
These students have mastered the algorithm for common denominators. The main risk here is B—giving the mathematically equivalent answer but ignoring the formatting constraint.
*   **A: 85%** (Solid understanding)
*   **B: 10%** (The "Improper Fraction" trap—calculated correctly but ignored the prompt)
*   **C: 0%**
*   **D: 5%** (A rare slip-up)

**Advanced (Working above Age Related Expectations)**
For these students, this is a 5-second question. They read the constraints carefully.
*   **A: 98%** (Precision and speed)
*   **B: 2%** (Rare over-complication/rushing)
*   **C: 0%**
*   **D: 0%**

### Teacher’s Note:
The "High Misconception" element here is **Option D**. In my experience, even Year 9s who "know" not to add denominators will do so instinctively if they are rushing or if the question appears in a non-calculator mental starter. **Option B** is the "Distractor for the Diligent"—it tests if they are reading the full instructions or just "doing the sum."
