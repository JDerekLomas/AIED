As an experienced UK maths teacher, I’ve seen this exact type of problem trip up Year 9 students hundreds of times. While the arithmetic seems straightforward, it sits at a "danger zone" of mathematical fluency where overconfidence meets poor fraction discipline.

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**

For a Year 9 student, this isn't "hard" in terms of new concepts, but it is high-stakes for errors. Most students move away from drawing fraction circles and into purely procedural territory here. The instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number" is a significant distractor/filter.

### **The Psychology of the Options:**
*   **A (99/20):** This is the "Improper Impulse." Many students convert to improper fractions to calculate ($27/10 + 9/4 = 54/20 + 45/20 = 99/20$) but forget to convert back to a mixed number as requested.
*   **B (Correct):** $4 \frac{19}{20}$. Requires finding a common denominator (20) and adding correctly.
*   **C (99/40):** This targets the most common misconception in fraction addition: adding the numerators AND the denominators ($27/10 + 9/4 = 36/14$ ... wait, no, $99/40$ comes from multiplying the denominators).
*   **D (4 8/14):** The "Junior School Shortcut." Students add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and then add across the numerators and denominators ($7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$). This is the classic "confidently wrong" answer.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**below_basic (Working at KS2 levels, approx. Grade 1-2):**
*   **A=10% B=15% C=25% D=50%**
*   *Rationale:* These students almost always choose **D**. It looks "right" because it uses the numbers in the question directly without any "scary" denominator changes.

**basic (Working at Grade 3-4):**
*   **A=30% B=30% C=10% D=30%**
*   *Rationale:* They know they shouldn't just add denominators, so they try to find a common denominator but often fail. Many will get the correct value as an improper fraction and stop at **A**, thinking they’ve finished.

**proficient (Working at Grade 5-6):**
*   **A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%**
*   *Rationale:* These students have the process down. Errors here are usually "careless"—either forgetting to convert back to mixed (A) or a simple multiplication error ($7 \times 2 = 15$ etc.).

**advanced (Working at Grade 7+):**
*   **A=2% B=97% C=0% D=1%**
*   *Rationale:* This is trivial for them. The only risk is a "speed error" where they misread the question or the options, but they are highly unlikely to fall for the conceptual traps.

### **Teacher’s Insight:**
In a typical mixed-ability Year 9 classroom, you will see a massive split. You'll have a group who finish in 20 seconds (the **B** crowd) and a group who finish in 5 seconds and are incredibly confident that the answer is **D**. The "D" group is the hardest to teach because their method is "logical" to them, even though it's mathematically illegal.
