Here is the predicted breakdown based on common Year 9 misconceptions regarding BIDMAS/BODMAS and the left-to-right rule for addition and subtraction.

**Teacher's Notes on Common Errors:**
*   **The "Addition before Subtraction" Trap (Problem P):** This is the most prevalent error. Students are taught "BIDMAS," where 'A' comes before 'S'. Many students—even mid-ability ones—mistakenly believe they *must* do $5+6$ first, rather than working left-to-right. This makes options C and D very "attractive."
*   **Left-to-Right Habit (Problem Q):** Lower-ability students often ignore operation hierarchy entirely and simply work left-to-right, leading them to pick $4+5$ first.
*   **The Correct Logic (B):** A student must know that $+$ and $-$ have equal priority (Problem P) AND that $\times$ outranks $+$ (Problem Q).
