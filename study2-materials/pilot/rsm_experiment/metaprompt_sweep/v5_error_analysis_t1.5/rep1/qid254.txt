Having just marked a mountain of these papers, the "Zero" is the ultimate heartbreaker in this question. Many Year 9s treat zero as "nothing" rather than a piece of data. 

**Diagnostic breakdown:**
*   **Option A** is the "Half-Right" trap. Students remember they must divide by 5 (the number of items), but they omit the 0 from the numerator because they think "adding zero doesn't change the sum." This is actually the correct calculation, but many students select it for the wrong reason, while others avoid it because they don't see the '0' physically written in the sum.
*   **Option B** is the BIDMAS/Calculator error. Students who use a non-fractional calculator write this string and get $7.4$ (0+1+3+4+1.4) instead of 3. Many basic-level students don't realise that without brackets, this calculation is mathematically incorrect for the mean.
*   **Option C** is the "Counting" error. Students see four non-zero digits and decide there are only four numbers to average. This is the most common error for students who understand the *process* of a mean but not the *definition* of data.
*   **Option D** is the "Over-thinker" trap. Advanced students might pick this if they are pedantic about the notation in A or B, but usually, they recognise that adding 0 doesn't change the total, making A perfectly valid.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on my 200 papers:

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=20% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=2% D=5%
