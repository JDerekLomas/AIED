Having marked 200 of these scripts, I can tell you that BIDMAS (order of operations) remains the single biggest "banana skin" for Year 9. The trap here is that the left-hand side requires division before addition ($8 + 3 = 11$), whereas the right-hand side forces addition first due to brackets ($20 \div 4 = 5$). 

Students at lower levels almost invariably read from left to right like a sentence, leading them to think both sides equal 5, or making simple arithmetic slips under exam pressure.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **The Left-to-Right Trap (LHS):** Students doing $8+12$ first get $20$, then $\div 4 = 5$. If they do this, they see $5 = 5$ and pick **C**.
*   **The Addition Bias (RHS):** Some students struggle with the concept that brackets *change* the value; they might assume the brackets are "extra" and that the operations are essentially the same.
*   **The Guess Factor:** Below-basic students often pick **D** because it looks "more mathematical" even if they don't understand the inequality symbol.

Here are my predicted percentages based on the common errors seen in a typical UK Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=14% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
