To predict these results, I’ve looked at the common Year 9 pitfalls for this specific question:

*   **Option D (The "Adder" Trap):** This is the most common lower-ability error. Students simply add the numerators ($7+1$) and the denominators ($10+4$). It feels "natural" and avoids the complexity of finding a common denominator.
*   **Option C (Partial Error):** Students find a common denominator by multiplying $10 \times 4$ to get $40$, but often fail to adjust the numerators correctly or get lost in the conversion, ending up with an incorrect improper fraction.
*   **Option A (The "Nearly There" Trap):** Students correctly calculate the answer as $\frac{99}{20}$ (or $4 \frac{19}{20}$ and convert it), but **fail to read the instruction** "Leave your answer as a mixed number." This is a classic proficient-level mistake.
*   **Option B (Correct):** Requires finding the common denominator (20) and correctly adding the whole numbers and fractional parts, then respecting the formatting instruction.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=30% D=45%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
