Having marked several hundred of these papers, this specific question is a classic "fractional operation" trap. 

The most common error across the board is a misunderstanding of how to "move" the 3. Students see the 3 and the 12 and instinctively want to divide 12 by 3 to get 4, leading them to A or C. Even stronger students often fall into the trap of multiplying the numerator instead of the denominator when dividing a fraction by an integer.

Here is the breakdown of how Year 9 students typically perform on this item:

- **Option A ($1/4$):** The "Common Intuition" trap. Students see $12 \div 3 = 4$ and assume the answer must be $1/4$.
- **Option B ($1/36$):** The correct answer ($1/12 \div 3 = 1/12 \times 1/3$). 
- **Option C ($4$):** The "Total Confusion" trap. Students ignore the fraction entirely and just do $12 \div 3$.
- **Option D ($1/9$):** The "Subtraction/Addition" trap. Students somehow try to relate the 3 and 12 through addition or subtraction, or miscalculate $3 \times 3$.
