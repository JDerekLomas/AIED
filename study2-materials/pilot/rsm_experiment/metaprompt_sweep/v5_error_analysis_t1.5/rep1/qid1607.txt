In this equation, Step 1 is correct (multiplying by 4). However, in Step 2, Isaac should have subtracted 1 from 60 to get $k=59$. Instead, he likely added 1 to 60 ($60+1=61$), a classic "change the side, change the sign" error where the student performs the inverse operation incorrectly or simply joins the numbers.

**Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the initial multiplication and might guess based on the final answer "looking" right. They frequently see "60" and "1" and assume "61" is the logical next step regardless of the operation.
**Basic:** This group usually recognizes that Step 1 is correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$). However, the "addition" error in Step 2 is an extremely high-frequency mistake at this level; many will see $60=1+k$ and instinctively do $60+1$ because they are used to "solving" involving addition.
**Proficient:** These students will almost all identify that Step 1 is correct. Most will spot the error in Step 2, though a small percentage will skim too quickly and see a 60 and a 61 and assume it’s correct without checking the inverse.
**Advanced:** These students will check the steps systematically. They will identify the subtraction error in Step 2 immediately.
