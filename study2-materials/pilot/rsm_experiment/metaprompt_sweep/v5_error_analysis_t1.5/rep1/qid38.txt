To solve this problem, students must find a common denominator (likely $2x$). 

*   **Option A (Correct):** Students multiply $\frac{4}{x}$ by $\frac{2}{2}$ to get $\frac{8}{2x}$, then add: $\frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.
*   **Option B (Add across):** The most common lower-level error where students add the numerators $(3+4=7)$ and the denominators $(2x+x=3x)$. 
*   **Option D (The "Half-way" error):** Students recognize the common denominator should be $2x$, but forget to multiply the numerator of the second fraction. They calculate $\frac{3+4}{2x}$.
*   **Option C (Denominator confusion):** Students multiply the first fraction by something incorrectly or mistakenly believe the $2$ disappears, focusing only on the $11$.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=30% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=0% D=20%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=0% D=2%
