In my experience marking this specific topic with Year 9 students, the "negative sign trap" is one of the most reliable discriminators between middle and top-tier students. 

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Answer B (12):** This is the classic "multiplication instead of indices" error ($3 \times 4 = 12$). This is the go-to guess for students who haven't grasped the concept of powers.
*   **Answer D (-12):** Same as above, but "carrying" the negative sign through.
*   **Answer C (-81):** This is the most "attractive" wrong answer. Many students correctly calculate $3^4 = 81$ but incorrectly assume that because the input is negative, the output must be negative. It also mirrors how most non-scientific calculators handle $-3^4$ without brackets, leading to student reinforcement of the error.
*   **Answer A (81):** The correct answer. Requires the student to know both the index value and the "even power of a negative is positive" rule.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on a typical Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
