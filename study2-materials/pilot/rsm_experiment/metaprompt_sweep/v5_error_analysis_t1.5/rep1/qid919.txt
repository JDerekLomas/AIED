To predict the performance of these 200 Year 9 students, we must look at the specific misconceptions associated with squaring decimals and the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

**Distractor Analysis:**
*   **A ($0.81$):** This is the "Double Squaring" or "Coefficient Trap." Students square the $3$ to get $9$, and square the $0.3$ to get $0.09$, then multiply ($9 \times 0.09 = 0.81$). Alternatively, they do $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2$.
*   **B ($0.27$):** This is the **correct** answer: $3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.
*   **C ($1.8$):** This is the "Linear Error." Students multiply the coefficient by the $x$ value first ($3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$) and then, instead of squaring, they double it (a common confusion between $x^2$ and $2x$).
*   **D ($2.7$):** This is the "Decimal Point Displacement." Students correctly identify $3 \times 3^2$ as $27$, but fail to account for the two decimal places required when squaring $0.3$ ($0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$). They often think one decimal place in the question means one in the answer.

**Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** Struggle with the concept of $x^2$ and the decimal point. Often guess or perform $3 \times 0.3 \times 2$.
*   **Basic:** Understand substitution but often follow the expression left-to-right $(3 \times 0.3)^2$ or fail the "two decimal places" rule when squaring $0.3$.
*   **Proficient:** Understand BIDMAS but are highly susceptible to the "one decimal place" mental shortcut, making **D** the most attractive trap for them.
*   **Advanced:** Usually comfortable with squaring decimals ($0.09$) and the order of operations, though "silly mistakes" with decimal placement still occur.
