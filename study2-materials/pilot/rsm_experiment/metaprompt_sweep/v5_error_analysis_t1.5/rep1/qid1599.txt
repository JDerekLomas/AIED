In marking 200 of these papers, I've seen exactly where the misconceptions lie. The transition from arithmetic division symbols to the "fraction bar" is a hurdle for many Year 9s.

**Distractor Analysis:**
*   **Option B:** This is a classic "clinging to variables" error. Students who don't understand how operators move often feel that the '$+4$' must somehow be distributed or balanced across both terms.
*   **Option C:** This is the most common conceptual error. It stems from a failure to recognise the brackets as a grouping mechanism. Students often process the division first ($c/h$) and simply append the $+4$ at the end, neglecting BIDMAS/order of operations.
*   **Option D:** This is a "directional" error. These students know it's a fraction but haven't solidified that the dividend is always the numerator. They often place the "heavier" looking expression ($h+4$) on the bottom out of habit, or simply get the orientation backwards.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student performance:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=55% B=5% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=10% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%
