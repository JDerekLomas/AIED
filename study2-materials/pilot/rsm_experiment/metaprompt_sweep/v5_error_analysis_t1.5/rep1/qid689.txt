In marking this particular set of 200 papers, this question acts as a classic "cognitive trap" regarding the position of the unknown. 

Students at the **below_basic** level often ignore the fractional structure and simply apply an operation to the two numbers visible (10 and 5). Most will multiply them, leading to 50.

At the **basic** level, students recognize they need to divide, but they default to "Large Number ÷ Small Number" ($10 \div 5$), which leads to the most common attractor: $p=2$. They fail to see that $p$ is the divisor.

The **proficient** students usually realize that $10p = 5$, but a significant portion of them will still make a mental slip during the final step, accidentally calculating $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$ because it feels "more natural."

The **advanced** students treat this as a reciprocal or a formal algebraic manipulation ($p = 5/10$) and are the only group that consistently identifies $0.5$ as the correct answer.

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=25% D=5%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=65% D=5%
proficient: A=45% B=5% C=48% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
