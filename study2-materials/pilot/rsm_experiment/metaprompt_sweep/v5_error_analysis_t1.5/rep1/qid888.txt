In this question, students must navigate two primary hurdles: the sum of the linear terms ($-5 + -7 = -12$) and the product of the constants ($-5 \times -7 = +35$). 

The most common "trap" is the sign of the constant term. Students often remember "a negative and a negative make a positive," but under exam pressure, they frequently default to $5 \times 7 = 35$ and then simply carry down the minus sign from the bracket. Option D is the "attractive distractor" for students who can add negative numbers but are sloppy with multiplication signs. Option A represents students who find the difference between 5 and 7 rather than the sum.

**below_basic:** These students often struggle with directed numbers. They might guess or see "two minuses" and pick the answer with two minuses (D) or simply pick A because 2 and 35 are "number facts" they associate with these digits.
**basic:** These students likely know FOIL or the Grid Method but consistently fail on the "negative $\times$ negative = positive" rule, leading them heavily toward D.
**proficient:** Most will get the +35, but a small portion will still make a "sign slip" on the middle term or be tempted by the symmetry of Option C.
**advanced:** These students will accurately apply the distributive law and verify the signs.

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=10% B=35% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
