Having marked 200 of these, I can tell you that the "addition of denominators" is the bane of my life in Year 9. Even though this is a relatively simple addition with common denominators, students often overcomplicate it or fall back on primitive "add across" instincts.

Here is the breakdown of how the different groups typically perform:

**A) $3 \frac{3}{5}$ (Correct):** The straightforward answer. Most students can do $2+1$ and $1+2$.
**B) $\frac{18}{5}$ (Incorrect format):** These students know the math but fail to read the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number." They convert to improper fractions to add (the "safe" method they were taught) but forget to convert back.
**C) $\frac{18}{10}$ (Calculation/Logic error):** This is the "nightmare" answer. They add the numerators, add the denominators, and then just shove the whole numbers on the front or ignore them entirely. 
**D) $3 \frac{3}{10}$ (Conceptual error):** Extremely common in lower sets. They add the whole numbers correctly and add the numerators correctly, but they reflexively add the denominators ($5+5=10$) because they want to "do something" to the bottom of the fraction.
