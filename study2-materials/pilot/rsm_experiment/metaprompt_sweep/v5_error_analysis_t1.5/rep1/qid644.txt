In my experience marking this specific type of question, the common pitfalls involve the "signs rule" for multiplication and the confusion between multiplying and adding.

**-1 × -4 = ?**
*   **Error for B (-4):** This is the most common error for mid-tier students. They recognise multiplication is required, but they either believe a "minus and a minus make a minus" or they simply copy the sign of the larger digit.
*   **Error for D (-5):** This is a classic "operation slip." Students see the two numbers and instinctively add them (-1 + -4) rather than multiplying, often because the word "expand" triggers a mental process of combining terms.
*   **Error for C (+5):** Students add the digits but remember the "double negative makes a positive" rule, applying it to the wrong operation.

Students at the **advanced** level almost never miss the sign, whereas **basic** ability students struggle significantly with the distinction between $-1 \times -4$ and $-1 - 4$.
