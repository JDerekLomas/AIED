In my experience marking this specific type of algebra question, the "balance method" versus the "multiplying everything" method is a classic stumbling block for Year 9s.

**Tom's method** is the standard approach: adding 5 to both sides. It feels safe and is taught first.
**Katie's method** is the "trap." Students often remember they need to "multiply by the denominator" but forget that they must multiply *every* term in the equation, not just the fraction and the result. They fail to multiply the -5 by 3.

Here is how the 200 papers usually break down:

**Below Basic:** These students often guess or see that Katie's "36" comes from $12 \times 3$ and think it looks "mathsy" enough to be right, without checking the $-5$.
**Basic:** Most can follow Tom’s logic (adding 5), but they frequently fall for Katie’s logic because they recognize $12 \times 3 = 36$ as a valid step in some context. They are highly likely to choose "Both."
**Proficient:** These students usually recognize Tom is definitely right. They pause at Katie; some will spot the error with the -5, but many still think you can just "move the 3" to the other side of the equals sign.
**Advanced:** These students are checking for the distribution of the multiplication. They will see that Katie should have written $x - 15 = 36$.
