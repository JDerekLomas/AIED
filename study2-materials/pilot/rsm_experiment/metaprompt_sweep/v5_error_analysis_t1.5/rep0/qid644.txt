In my experience marking this specific type of question, the errors are highly predictable. Students at the lower end of the spectrum frequently confuse multiplication with addition (the "arithmetic operator slip"), leading them to see $-1$ and $-4$ and conclude the answer is $-5$ or $+5$. 

The most common "trap" for mid-range students is the sign rule. While they know they must multiply $1 \times 4$, many instinctively believe that because the numbers in the brackets are negative, the result must stay negative. Only the top-tier students consistently apply the "negative times a negative equals a positive" rule correctly under exam pressure.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=35% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=75% B=20% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
