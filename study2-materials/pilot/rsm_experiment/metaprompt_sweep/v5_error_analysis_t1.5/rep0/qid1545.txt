To predict these results, I’ve looked at the common misconceptions surrounding BIDMAS/Order of Operations that I see regularly in Year 9 mocks.

**The "Left-to-Right" Trap:** "Below basic" and "Basic" students often ignore priority and calculate $8+12$ first on the left-hand side ($20 \div 4 = 5$). Since the right-hand side is also $5$, they gravitate towards **C (=)**. 
**The "Addition First" Habit:** Some students incorrectly believe addition should happen before division (perhaps misremembering the acronym), leading them to conclude both sides are equal.
**Proficient/Advanced Success:** "Proficient" students usually remember division comes first ($8 + 3 = 11$), and "Advanced" students check their work twice to ensure they haven't fallen for the "visual symmetry" of the numbers.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
