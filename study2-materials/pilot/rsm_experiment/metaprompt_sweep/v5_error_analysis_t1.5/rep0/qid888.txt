To predict these percentages, I have evaluated the most common Year 9 misconceptions regarding expanding double brackets with two negative constants.

**The "Attractive" Errors:**
*   **The Negative Multiplication Trap:** The most common error is $(-5) \times (-7) = -35$. This makes option D highly attractive to students who can add $(-5) + (-7)$ correctly but fail the sign rule for multiplication.
*   **The Difference Trap:** Option A comes from students "finding the difference" between 5 and 7 to get 2, or simply subtracting 5 from 7 and ignoring the signs of the terms.
*   **The Sign Overload:** Option C is for students who know a "double negative makes a positive" but apply it indiscriminately to both the middle term and the constant term.

**Breakdown by Ability Level:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often struggle with the concept of FOIL/Grid method and frequently make mistakes with directed number addition and multiplication.
*   **Basic:** Can usually get the $m^2$ and the $12m$, but will almost reflexively write $-35$ because they see two minus signs in the question.
*   **Proficient:** Understand the process well but are prone to "sign slips" under exam pressure, particularly with the final constant.
*   **Advanced:** Usually have the mental fluencies to double-check that a negative multiplied by a negative must result in a positive constant.

basic: A=10% B=30% C=20% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
