In this question, the difficulty lies in the implicit form of the equation ($4x + 2y = 10$). Students must first substitute $x=0$, leaving them with $2y=10$, and then solve for $y$. 

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option C (5):** The correct answer ($10 \div 2$).
*   **Option B (3):** A very "attractive" error for middle-ability students. They substitute $x=1$ instead of $x=0$, or they look for a linear pattern and assume the next value is an integer based on $x=1 \rightarrow y=3$. 
*   **Option A (20):** Common among lower-ability students who multiply the constants ($4 \times 5$ or $2 \times 10$) or perform $10 \times 2$ instead of $10 \div 2$.
*   **Option D (2.5):** Students who confuse $x$ and $y$, or divide $10 \div 4$ because 4 is the first coefficient they see.
