To predict the performance of a Year 9 cohort on this question, we have to look at the "hidden" operation in Step 2.

In **Step 1**, Isaac correctly multiplies by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). This is a standard first step that most students recognise. 
In **Step 2**, Isaac makes a classic "inverse operation" error. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$, he sees the "$+1$" and performs the same action on the other side ($60 + 1 = 61$) rather than the inverse, or perhaps he mistakenly "moves" the 1 and changes the wrong sign.

**Predicted Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with multi-step logic. They see the correct multiplication in Step 1 and assume the whole thing must be correct, or they guess.
*   **Basic:** This group is the most likely to fall for the trap. They recognise that Step 1 is right ($15 \times 4$ is definitely 60), and their own algebraic manipulation is shaky enough that they don't spot the sign error in Step 2. Option C is very "attractive" here because the numbers look "tidy".
*   **Proficient:** These students usually have a "check" instinct. They might initially think it's C, but then quickly realize $61+1$ divided by 4 isn't 15. They correctly identify that Step 1 is valid but Step 2 is a blunder.
*   **Advanced:** These students will spot the error instantly. They rarely make the inverse-operation mistake and are highly unlikely to select C or D.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=2% C=20% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
