In my experience marking this specific type of algebraic equation—where the unknown is the denominator—Year 9 students frequently fall into the "division is commutative" trap or simply perform the operation on the two numbers they see in the order that feels most natural.

**The Logic Behind the Errors:**
*   **Option B ($p=50$):** This is the most common error for **Below Basic** students. They see a division sign and a 10, so they "undo" it by multiplying $10 \times 5$. It follows a memorized rule (inverse operations) but applied without logical checking.
*   **Option C ($p=2$):** This is the "high-frequency trap." Students mentally calculate $10 \div 5$ because it results in a whole number. In their heads, they restructure the equation to $\frac{10}{5} = p$ because $5 \div 10$ feels "wrong" or harder to calculate. Even **Basic** students often fall for this because 2 "feels" like a right answer.
*   **Option A ($p=0.5$):** The correct answer. To get here, a student must either multiply by $p$ first ($10p = 5$) or recognise that $p = 5/10$. **Proficient** students usually get here, though some still rush and choose C. **Advanced** students verify by subbing back in: $5 \div 0.5 = 10$.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on 200 mock papers:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=40% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=23% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
