Having marked hundreds of these, here is my breakdown of how Year 9 students tackle this classic "zero in the mean" trap.

**Teacher's Notes on Common Errors:**
*   **The Zero Trap (Option C):** This is the most "attractive" error for students who follow the "sum divided by how many numbers" rule but subconsciously only count "visible" or non-zero digits. 
*   **The Bidmas Trap (Option B):** This catches students who know the components of the mean but don't understand that a fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol. On a calculator, entering "0+1+3+4+7 ÷ 5" yields 16.4 because it only divides the 7 by 5.
*   **The Conceptual Shortcut (Option A):** This is the correct answer. The zero doesn't change the sum, but it *must* be included in the count. High-ability students see this immediately; mid-ability students often doubt it because they don't see the "0" written in the numerator.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=50% D=5%
**Reasoning:** These students almost universally ignore the zero when counting. They see 4 "actual" numbers and choose C. Option B is also very popular because it looks like a standard horizontal sum.

basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
**Reasoning:** A real split here. Many have been taught the "count the zero" rule but second-guess themselves because the zero isn't explicitly written in the numerator of Option A. They often revert to C.

proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
**Reasoning:** Most in this bracket recognize that adding zero doesn't change the total, so they accept Option A. A small portion still falls for the "divide by 4" trap if they are working too quickly.

advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
**Reasoning:** These students understand that the numerator is the sum and the denominator is the count ($n=5$). They are immune to the visual absence of the zero in the addition.
