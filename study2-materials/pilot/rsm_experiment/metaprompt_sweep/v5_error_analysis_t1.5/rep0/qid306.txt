Here is the predicted breakdown based on common misconceptions seen in Year 9 mock exams, specifically regarding BIDMAS/BODMAS and the left-to-right rule for addition/subtraction.

**Teacher's Notes on Common Errors:**
*   **The "A before S" Trap:** In Problem P, many students wrongly believe Addition *must* come before Subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS. This makes options C and D very attractive to middle-ability students.
*   **The "Read Left-to-Right" Trap:** In Problem Q, lower-ability students ignore order of operations entirely and just process numbers as they appear.
*   **The Correct Logic:** In Problem P, addition and subtraction have equal priority, so you work left-to-right (4-5). In Problem Q, multiplication takes priority. Therefore, **B** is the correct answer.
