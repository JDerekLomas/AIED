To predict these results, I’ve analysed the common pitfalls for Year 9 students:
*   **The "Add Across" Trap (D):** This is the classic lower-ability error where students add the numerators ($7+1$) and denominators ($10+4$) separately. It feels "natural" and avoids the complexity of finding a common multiple.
*   **The Mixed Number Oversight (A):** Proficient students often convert everything to improper fractions immediately ($\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4}$) to avoid mistakes. Many calculate the correct total ($\frac{99}{20}$) but fail to read the instruction to "leave as a mixed number."
*   **Denominator Errors (C):** Students who multiply the denominators ($10 \times 4$) but fail to adjust the numerators correctly, or simply multiply the denominators and then add the numerators, often end up with 40 as a base.
*   **The Conceptual Path (B):** This is the correct path: $2+2=4$ and $\frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20}$.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on a 200-paper sample:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=25% D=50%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=35% B=55% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=10% B=88% C=1% D=1%
