In my experience marking this specific type of algebra question for Year 9, the distinction between these two methods reveals exactly where a student’s understanding of inverse operations and "balancing" lies.

**Tom's method** is the standard "step-by-step" approach (adding 5 to both sides). Most students find this intuitive.
**Katie's method** represents a common misconception regarding the distributive property (or lack thereof) when multiplying through. Many students forget that to multiply the equation by 3, they *must* multiply every term, including the -5. Therefore, \(x - 5 = 36\) is a very "attractive" error because students see the \(x/3\) and the \(12\) and multiply them, but "bring down" the -5 unchanged.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

**below_basic:** These students struggle with two-step equations. They often pick D because they don't recognise either operation, or B because they intuitively feel multiplication should come first but miss the distributive step.
**basic:** These students know "add 5" is correct, so they gravitate towards A. They often see Katie’s "36" and think "3 times 12 is 36, that looks right," leading many to C.
**proficient:** These students are solid on the standard algorithm (Tom), but the trap in Katie's working is designed specifically for this level. They often fail to spot that the -5 wasn't multiplied.
**advanced:** These students check the validity of the step by either performing the operation themselves or substituting a value. They will recognise that Katie failed to multiply the -5 by 3.

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%
