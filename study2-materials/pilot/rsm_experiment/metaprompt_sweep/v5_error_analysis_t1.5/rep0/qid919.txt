To predict these results, I have analysed the common misconceptions associated with squaring decimals and the order of operations (BIDMAS).

**Misconception Analysis:**
*   **Option B (0.27):** This is the correct answer. $(0.3)^2 = 0.09$, then $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$.
*   **Option A (0.81):** This comes from an "order of operations" error. The student multiplies 3 by 0.3 first to get 0.9, then squares 0.9. This is the most common conceptual trap for middle-ability students.
*   **Option D (2.7):** This is a place value error. The student knows $3 \times 3^2 = 27$, but misplaces the decimal point, often thinking "one decimal place in the question, so one in the answer," forgetting that squaring 0.3 creates two decimal places.
*   **Option C (1.8):** This is a doubling error. The student "squares" by multiplying by 2. $0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$, then $0.6 \times 3 = 1.8$.

**Predicted Percentages:**
