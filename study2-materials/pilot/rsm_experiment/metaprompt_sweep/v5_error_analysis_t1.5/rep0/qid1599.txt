In marking this question for Year 9, the main challenge is not the concept of division as a fraction, but rather the structural interpretation of the brackets and the "left-to-right" reading of the expression.

**Error Analysis:**
*   **Option B (Attractive Distractor for Below Basic):** Students often "distribute" the operation incorrectly or feel the need to balance the expression by adding the constant to the numerator as well.
*   **Option C (The Order/Brackets Trap):** This is the most common error for "Basic" students. They often ignore the brackets or fail to realise the fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol. They translate the $c \div h$ first and then append the $+4$ at the end.
*   **Option D (The Reciprocal Trap):** Students who have just learned about "keep-change-flip" for fractions often habitually swap the order of terms in any division problem, thinking the variable always goes on the bottom or the larger "chunk" goes on top.
*   **Option A (Correct):** Proficient students recognise the vinculum (fraction bar) replaces the $\div$ symbol and brackets.

**Predicted Results:**

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=10% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%
