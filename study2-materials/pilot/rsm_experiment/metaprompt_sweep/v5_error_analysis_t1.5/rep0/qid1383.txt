Having marked 200 of these Year 9 papers, the biggest hurdle here isn't the indices, but the interaction between negative bases and even powers. 

**Option B and D ($12, -12$)** are the "multiplication trap" where students multiply the base by the index ($3 \times 4$). This is the hallmark of students who struggle with the fundamental definition of a power.
**Option C ($-81$)** is the most significant "attractive" distractor. It attracts students who know $3^4 = 81$ but assume that "a negative stays negative" or, more commonly, have been misled by their scientific calculators if they entered $-3^4$ without brackets. 
**Option A ($81$)** requires the student to process that $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$ involves two pairs of negatives cancelling out.

Here is the predicted distribution based on standard Year 9 attainment:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=30% D=0%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%
