In this Year 9 mock, students find rearanging formulae involving fractions and roots particularly challenging. Many can recall $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ but crumble when performing the inverse operations in the correct order.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A is the "multiplication trap":** Students see the $\frac{4}{3}$ and automatically multiply $V$ by the numerator ($4$) rather than the reciprocal. It looks "neat" to keep the $4$ on top.
*   **B is the "lost $\pi$ trap":** Students correctly invert the fraction but forget that $\pi$ is attached to the numerator (effectively $\frac{4\pi}{3}$). They leave it in the denominator of the original fraction's position.
*   **C is the correct answer:** Requires multiplying by $3$, dividing by $4\pi$, then cube rooting.
*   **D is the "order of operations error":** Students try to cube root $V$ first and then treat the $\frac{3}{4\pi}$ as a coefficient to be applied outside the radical.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=30% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=3% C=90% D=2%
