To predict these results, I have analysed the common cognitive pathways Year 9 students take when faced with substituting into a linear equation where the unknown is $x$:

*   **The Trap (C):** The most common "natural" error is for students to assume the table wants them to find $y$ given $x$. They substitute $x = 0.5$ instead of $y = 0.5$. $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y \approx -4.16$, but more simply, students often do $(30 + 3) \div 10 = 3.3$ or similar faulty rearrangements involving the $0.5$.
*   **The Arithmetic Slip (D):** Solving $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$ leads to $10x - 3 = 30$. Students then subtract 3 instead of adding it, giving $10x = 27$, hence $x = 2.7$. This is highly "attractive" as it uses the correct substitution but fails on basic inverse operations.
*   **The Sign Error (B):** Students arrive at $10x - 3 = 30$ but somehow treat the constant as positive on the left, or mangle the division by 10 with a negative sign.
*   **The Correct Path (A):** $10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$? No—wait, let's re-calculate as a student would: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$. 

*Correction on Option A vs C:* Actually, $3.3$ is the correct answer mathematically ($33/10$). Therefore, Option C is the correct answer. I will adjust the "attractive distractors" accordingly. D (2.7) is the standard inverse operation error (subtracting 3). A and B (4.25) usually come from students trying to involve the '6' and '10' in a division before adding ($30/10 + 6/0.5$ or similar nonsensical combinations).
