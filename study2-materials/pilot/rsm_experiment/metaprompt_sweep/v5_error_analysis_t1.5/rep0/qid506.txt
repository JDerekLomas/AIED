Having just spent several hours trawling through 200 of these papers, this question is a classic "fraction-action" trap. Students see the 3 and the 12 and their brains immediately hunt for a relationship between them.

**Teacher's Reflection:**
*   **The Trap for (A):** The most common error. Students see $3$ and $12$ and simply divide $12 \div 3$. They ignore the fact that the $12$ is in the denominator.
*   **The Trap for (C):** Students "cross-multiply" incorrectly or treat the equation as $\frac{p}{3} = 12$, leading to $3 \times 12$. They also often just guess a whole number because they are uncomfortable with fractions.
*   **The Trap for (D):** Usually a result of students thinking they need to "square" or somehow combine the numbers into a common square number, or simply a miscalculation of $3 \times 3$.
*   **The Correct Path (B):** Requires understanding that to isolate $p$, you must divide by $3$, which is equivalent to multiplying the denominator by $3$ ($12 \times 3 = 36$).

Here is the predicted breakdown based on my Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=50% B=10% C=35% D=5%
basic: A=55% B=25% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
