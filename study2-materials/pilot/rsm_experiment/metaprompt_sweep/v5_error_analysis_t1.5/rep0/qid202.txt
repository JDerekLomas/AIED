Having marked hundreds of these scripts, this question is a classic "read the full instructions" test. While the arithmetic is simple, the "Leave your answer as a mixed number" constraint and the temptation to add the denominators are the primary distractors.

*   **Error A (Correct):** Adding whole numbers (3) and numerators (3) over the common denominator.
*   **Error B (Incorrect Form):** Students convert correctly to $11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$, but stop there and ignore the instruction to provide a mixed number.
*   **Error C (The Double Error):** Adding numerators AND denominators ($3/10$) and ignoring the whole numbers. Common in students who have a weak grasp of fractions as parts of a whole.
*   **Error D (Denominator Addition):** Students add the whole numbers (3) and the numerators (3), but then add the denominators ($5+5=10$). This is the most "attractive" trap for lower-ability students.
