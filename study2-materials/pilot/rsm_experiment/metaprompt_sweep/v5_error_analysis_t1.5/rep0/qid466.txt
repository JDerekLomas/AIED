To get to a product of 1, a fraction must be multiplied by its reciprocal. To keep the sign negative, the second number must be positive. 

*   **A is correct.**
*   **B is the most common error:** Students remember the rule "flip it" for reciprocals but often feel they must also change or keep the negative sign to "make it match" or because they are over-applying the rule for perpendicular gradients ($-\frac{1}{m}$).
*   **C & D:** These are chosen by lower-ability students who confuse multiplication rules with addition rules (thinking they need to add something to get to a whole number) or simply repeat the digits provided in the question.

Here are the predicted percentages:
