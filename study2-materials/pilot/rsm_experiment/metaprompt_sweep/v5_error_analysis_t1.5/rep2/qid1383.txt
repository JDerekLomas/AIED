In my experience marking this specific topic with Year 9 students, the "negative base" is the ultimate trap. Many students understand that $3^4 = 81$, but their grasp of how powers interact with negative signs is often shaky, especially if they are overly reliant on non-scientific calculators or mental "shortcuts."

Here is my prediction of the results after marking a large cohort like 200 papers:

**below_basic:** A=10% B=45% C=10% D=35%
*At this level, "4 lots of 3" is the most common thought process. Many will simply multiply the base by the index ($3 \times 4$). They see the negative sign and often attach it to their final answer (D), though some ignore it (B).*

**basic:** A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
*Students here recognize that $k^4$ means $k \times k \times k \times k$. However, they almost universally fall into the "negative times negative" trap. They often calculate $3^4 = 81$ and then reflexively put a minus sign in front of it because the input was negative, leading them to C.*

**proficient:** A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
*These students are generally confident with powers and know that $3^4 = 81$. A significant minority will still fall for the "it stays negative" rule (Option C), but the majority will correctly identify that four negatives multiply to make a positive.*

**advanced:** A=96% B=0% C=4% D=0%
*High-achieving Year 9s will spot the even power immediately. The only ones who get this wrong are those making a "transcription error" or those who typed `-3^4` into a calculator without brackets and trusted the output of -81.*

**Summary of Predictions:**
below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=65% B=05% C=25% D=05%
advanced: A=96% B=00% C=04% D=00%
