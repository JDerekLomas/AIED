After marking hundreds of these papers, the primary issue with this specific question isn't usually the addition itself, but rather the instruction to "leave as a mixed number" and the classic "denominator addition" trap.

**Reflections on the errors:**
*   **A (The Correct Answer):** Most students find this easy as the denominators are already the same. The "partitioning" method ($2+1$ and $1/5+2/5$) is the standard approach here.
*   **B (The 'Improper' Pitfall):** This is a very "attractive" wrong answer for proficient students. They instinctively convert to improper fractions to add ($11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$) but forget to convert back to a mixed number as requested.
*   **C (The Combined Trap):** This is the "Below Basic" hallmark—adding the numerators and adding the denominators ($3/10$) and then multiplying the whole numbers ($2 \times 1$) or just mangling the operation entirely.
*   **D (The Denominator Error):** Students who know to add the whole numbers but feel that "everything must be added" will add the denominators, resulting in $3/10$. This is the most common error for students at the "Basic" level.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=55% B=10% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
