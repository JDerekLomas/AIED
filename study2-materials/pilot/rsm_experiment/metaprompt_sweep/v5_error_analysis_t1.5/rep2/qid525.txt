To calculate the correct answer:
$2 \frac{7}{10} + 2 \frac{1}{4} = 4 + (\frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20}) = 4 \frac{19}{20}$

**Teacher’s Marking Notes:**
*   **The Trap (Option D):** Adding the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$). This is the most common error among low-ability students who forget they need a common denominator.
*   **The Format Error (Option A):** These students used the correct common denominator ($20$) and calculated $4 \frac{19}{20}$, but then converted it back to an improper fraction ($\frac{99}{20}$). While mathematically equal, the question specifically asked for a mixed number, and mid-range students often "over-simplify."
*   **The Denominator Error (Option C):** Students who find a common denominator by simply multiplying $10 \times 4$ to get $40$, but then either fail to scale the numerators correctly or make a calculation slip.
*   **Proficient vs. Advanced:** Proficient students usually get the common denominator right but occasionally fall for the format trap. Advanced students read the full instruction ("Leave your answer as a mixed number") and execute the fractional addition flawlessly.
