To predict these percentages, I’ve considered the most common "Year 9 traps." This question specifically tests the understanding of the unknown in the denominator. 

**Option B ($p=50$)** is the classic multiplication error where students see "10" and "5" and assume they must multiply ($10 \times 5 = 50$). 
**Option C ($p=2$)** is the most "attractive" distractor; students recognize that 10 and 5 are related by a factor of 2, but they divide the larger number by the smaller ($10 \div 5$) regardless of the algebraic structure. 
**Option A ($p=0.5$)** is the correct answer, but it requires two steps ($10p = 5$ then $p = 5/10$) or the insight that 5 must be halved to get 10. Many students find $5/10 = 0.5$ counter-intuitive compared to $10/5 = 2$.

Below are the predicted distributions:

below_basic: A=5% B=45% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=28% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=4% D=0%
