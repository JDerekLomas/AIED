In this Year 9 mock, students find this question deceptively tricky because the equation $4x + 2y = 10$ is in implicit form rather than the standard $y=mx+c$. 

*   **Error Analysis for A (20):** This is the "operation flip." Students see $4$, $x=0$, $y$, and $10$. They ignore the $2$, multiply $4 \times 5$ to get 20, or mistakenly think they need to multiply $4 \times 10$ and divide by $2$. 
*   **Error Analysis for B (3):** This is the "sequence hunter" error. Students assume the $y$ row must be a simple arithmetic progression. They look at $x=0, 1, 2...$ and $4, 2, 10$ and try to "find a pattern" that fits a common difference, often guessing 3 because it sits between 2 and 4.
*   **Error Analysis for C (5):** The most "attractive" trap. Students correctly substitute $x=0$, leaving $2y=10$. They then perform the division. However, many students mistakenly think the $4$ is irrelevant and just look for what makes the equation work with the constants they see ($10 \div 2$).
*   **Error Analysis for D (2.5):** This is the "division swap." Students see $4$ and $10$ and calculate $10 \div 4 = 2.5$, completely ignoring the coefficient of $y$.
