In this Year 9 cohort, the most common trap is the "Left-to-Right" fallacy. Students often ignore the BIDMAS/BODMAS priority of multiplication over addition and subtraction, calculating $(3-5+4) \times 2$. 

The "Attractive" errors break down as follows:
- **Option B (The Correct Answer):** $3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6$. Wait, correction: $3 - 5 = -2$. Then $-2 + 8 = 6$. So **Option A** is the correct answer ($6$). 
- **Option B (The Mistake):** $3 - (5+4) \times 2 = 3 - 9 \times 2 = -15$ (Not listed) OR $3-5+8$ but incorrectly doing $5+8=13$ then $3-13 = -10$ (Option D).
- **Option C (-12):** Left-to-right processing: $3-5 = -2$; $-2+4 = 2$; $2 \times 2 = 4$... No, wait. Option C comes from $(3 - (5+4)) \times 2 = -6 \times 2 = -12$.
- **Option D (-10):** A very common high-frequency error: $3 - (5 + 8) = 3 - 13 = -10$. This happens when students know they must do $4 \times 2$ first, but then see the addition sign and "group" the $5 + 8$ before dealing with the subtraction at the front.
