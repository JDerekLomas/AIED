In this Year 9 cohort, the primary obstacle is place value when squaring decimals. Many students follow the correct process $(0.3^2 \times 3)$ but struggle with the number of decimal places in the squaring stage.

**Distractor Analysis:**
- **A (0.81):** A classic "order of operations" error. The student multiplies $3 \times 0.3$ first to get $0.9$, then squares it. This is the most common error for mid-ability students who know they need to square something but forget BIDMAS/PEMDAS.
- **C (1.8):** A "doubling instead of squaring" error. The student calculates $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$. 
- **D (2.7):** A "place value" error during the square. The student thinks $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ (instead of $0.09$), then multiplies by $3$. This feels very "right" to a student who is working too quickly.
- **B (0.27):** The correct answer. Requires knowing $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$ and then multiplying by $3$.

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 mock papers:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=30% B=45% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=0% D=5%
