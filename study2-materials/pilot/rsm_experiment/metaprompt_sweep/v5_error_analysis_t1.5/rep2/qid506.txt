After marking 200 of these, I can tell you this is a classic "separator" question. Many students see the 3 and the 12 and their brains immediately jump to "multiplication" or "division" involving the integers, without respecting the fraction.

**Error Analysis:**
*   **Option A ($1/4$):** This is the most common error. Students see "3" and "12" and perform $12 \div 3$, ignoring the fact that 12 is a denominator.
*   **Option B (Correct):** To solve $3p = 1/12$, you must divide by 3 (or multiply by $1/3$), giving $p = 1/36$.
*   **Option C ($4$):** A "Below Basic" classic. They rearrange $3p = 1/12$ into $p = 12 \div 3$ as if the 12 were a whole number on the other side.
*   **Option D ($1/9$):** A calculation confusion where they might try to multiply 3 by 3 instead of 12, or perform $3^2$ for some reason—less common, but happens.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=55% B=30% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=75% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=97% C=1% D=0%
