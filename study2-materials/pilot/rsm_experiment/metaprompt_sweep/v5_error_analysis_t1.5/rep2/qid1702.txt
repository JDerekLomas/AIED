To predict these results, I’ve analysed the common misconceptions associated with this specific linear equation.

**The "Traps" in this question:**
*   **The Sign Error (Option B):** Students often struggle with the $-6y$ when substituting. They calculate $10x - 3 = 30$, but then mistakenly add 3 to both sides to get $10x = 33 \rightarrow 3.3$ (Option C) or, more commonly, subtract 3 as if it were a positive constant, or mess up the rearrangement of the negative term.
*   **The Reverse Substitution (Option D):** Lower-ability students often mistake the row order and substitute $0.5$ for $x$ instead of $y$. If $x = 0.5$, then $5 - 6y = 30 \rightarrow -6y = 25 \rightarrow y \approx -4.16$. However, some simply do $(30 - 3)/10 = 2.7$, treating the equation as if it were $10x + 6y = 30$.
*   **The Decimal/Division Error (Option C):** $10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 33 \rightarrow x = 3.3$. This is the most common "logical" error for middle-ability students who correctly substitute but fail the basic arithmetic of moving $-3$ across the equals sign.
*   **Correct Calculation (Option A):** $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 33 \rightarrow x = 3.3$. Wait—looking at my own marking experience, the math for A is actually $10x = 30 + 3 \rightarrow 33$. **Actually**, Option A ($4.25$) often comes from students thinking $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$ means $10x = 30 + 3$ (which is $3.3$), but if they think $6 \times 0.5$ is $6.5$ or some other variant, they go adrift. Actually, A is $33/10$ but often students see the $.3$ and gravitate towards the 'prettier' $3.3$. 

*Re-evaluating A vs C:* If $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, $x = 3.3$. **C is the correct answer.** If the correct answer is C, then A and B are the "attractive" distractors based on $0.5 \times 6 = 3$ errors.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
