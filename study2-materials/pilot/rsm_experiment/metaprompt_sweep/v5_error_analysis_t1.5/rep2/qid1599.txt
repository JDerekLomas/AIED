In marking 200 of these Year 9 papers, the main hurdles are the conceptual shift from the division symbol $(\div)$ to the fraction bar, and the "direction" of that division.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option B:** A "copying error" or hallucination where students feel the need to balance the expression by adding $+4$ to the numerator because it is in the denominator.
*   **Option C:** A failure to understand the significance of the brackets. Students perform $c \div h$ first and then simply append the $+4$ at the end. This is a very common "visual" error.
*   **Option D:** The "Order Trap." Many students (particularly at the lower end) struggle with the fact that in algebra, the first term goes on top. They often reflexively put the "heavier" expression on top or simply reverse the order.

**Predicted Distributions:**
