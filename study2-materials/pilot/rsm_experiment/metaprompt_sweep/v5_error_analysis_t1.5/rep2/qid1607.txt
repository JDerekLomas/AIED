After marking 200 of these papers, the pattern is very clear. This question isn't testing algebraic manipulation as much as it's testing "inverse operation" logic. 

**Step 1** is almost universally accepted because $15 \times 4 = 60$ is a "friendly" calculation. 
**Step 2** is the trap. Students see $60$, $1$, and $k$. Their brain yells "inverse operation," but instead of subtracting 1 to undo the $+1$, many impulsively add it because they are mentally rushing or confused by the direction of the equation.

Here is the breakdown of how Year 9 students typically perform on this specific distracter:

- **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the first step (multiplication) or simply guess based on the "look" of the numbers. They often choose C because the steps "look like" maths.
- **Basic:** This group is the most likely to fall for the trap. They correctly validate $15 \times 4 = 60$ (Step 1), but then instinctively add $60 + 1$ to get $61$. They select C because they think they've confirmed the arithmetic.
- **Proficient:** These students recognise the error in Step 2. They know you should subtract 1 to get $k=59$. They are the primary cohort selecting A.
- **Advanced:** These students spot the error immediately. Very few will fall for the trap, though a tiny percentage might overthink it and choose D if they misread the notation.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=10% D=3%
advanced: A=97% B=1% C=1% D=1%
