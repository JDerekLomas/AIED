In my experience marking this specific type of question for Year 9s, the results are always a fascinating insight into how they internalise BIDMAS/BODMAS.

**Problem P ($4-5+6$)** is the "super trap." Lower-ability students have been told "Addition comes before Subtraction" in the acronym, so they rigidly apply $5+6$ first. More capable students understand that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be done left-to-right.

**Problem Q ($4+5 \times 6$)** is much better understood across all levels because the hierarchy between multiplication and addition is more strictly reinforced in primary school.

Here is the breakdown of how 200 Year 9 students typically distribute their answers:

**below_basic:** A=15% B=15% C=35% D=35%
*They often focus purely on the letters in BIDMAS. Because 'A' comes before 'S', they choose D or C. They struggle to distinguish between the two problems, leading to a high spread across options containing $5+6$.*

**basic:** A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
*These students usually get Problem Q right ($5 \times 6$) because the rule for multiplication is "loud" in their heads. However, they almost always fail Problem P, rigidly applying the 'Addition before Subtraction' rule, leading them to Option D.*

**proficient:** A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
*Most of these students have grasped that addition and subtraction are equal priority (left-to-right), leading them to $4-5$. A small cohort still gets "fooled" by the acronym order in Problem P but gets Problem Q correct.*

**advanced:** A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
*Almost all top-set students recognise the left-to-right rule for $4-5+6$ and the hierarchy for $5 \times 6$. The few errors here are usually down to overthinking or simple misreads of the options.*
