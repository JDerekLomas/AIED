To predict these percentages, I have considered the classic pitfalls for Year 9 students:
1. **The Negative Multiplication Rule:** Lower-ability students frequently remember that "a negative and a negative make a..." but apply it inconsistently, or assume the answer must be negative because the inputs are.
2. **Operation Confusion:** Students at the 'Below Basic' level often add the numbers ($-1 - 4 = -5$ or $-1 + -4$) rather than multiplying them, as their brain defaults to the "collecting like terms" mindset often taught alongside expansion.
3. **Sign Blindness:** 'Basic' level students often perform the multiplication ($1 \times 4 = 4$) but ignore the signs entirely, or take the sign of the larger number.

Here is the predicted breakdown based on a typical 200-paper sample:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
