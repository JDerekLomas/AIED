To arrive at these predictions, I have considered the following common student misconceptions:

*   **Option A (The Inverse Trap):** This is the most "attractive" distractor. Students frequently remember the rule for reaching 1 (the reciprocal) but forget how that interacts with a negative sign. They see a negative in the question and a negative in the answer and assume the star must be positive because "the negative is already there."
*   **Option B (The Correct Answer):** This requires a student to understand that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive, and that to get back to 1, you need the reciprocal.
*   **Option C (The Identity Error):** Found most often in lower-ability papers where students struggle with fractions. They see numbers and signs and guess based on familiarity, often thinking they need to "add" something back to reach zero or one.
*   **Option D (The Repetition Error):** Common in the "Below Basic" category, where students simply mirror the number provided in the question because they don't understand the multiplicative inverse.
