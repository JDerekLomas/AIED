In this Year 9 mock, this question is a classic test of algebraic manipulation involving formulas. Students struggle significantly with "undoing" a fraction, often multiplying by the numerator instead of the denominator.

**The Error Patterns:**
*   **Choice C (Correct):** Students must multiply by 3, divide by $4\pi$, then cube root.
*   **Choice A (The "Multiply everything" error):** This is the most common mistake for lower-attaining students. They see $4$, $3$, and $\pi$ and essentially "bring them over" to the other side without considering whether they should be multiplying or dividing. They assume all constants go to the numerator.
*   **Choice B (The "Misplaced $\pi$" error):** These students correctly handle the $4/3$ fraction by multiplying by 3 and dividing by 4, but they treat $\pi$ as being "attached" to the $V$ side or fail to move it to the denominator correctly.
*   **Choice D (The "Order of Operations" error):** These students remember the cube root is involved but fail to see that the entire fraction must be inside the radical. They try to "extract" parts of the formula.

Here is the predicted distribution based on marking similar Year 9 cohorts:

below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=65% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=93% D=2%
