In this context, I am looking for the student's ability to apply the FOIL method (First, Outside, Inside, Last) and correctly manipulate directed numbers, specifically the rule that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive.

**Error Analysis:**
*   **Option B (Correct):** Students correctly sum $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$ and multiply them to get $+35$.
*   **Option D (The "Sign Error" Trap):** This is the most common mistake. Students successfully add the negatives to get $-12m$, but instinctively write $-35$ because they see two minus signs in the question and associate the whole expression with subtraction, or simply forget the "minus times minus" rule.
*   **Option A (The "Difference" Trap):** These students find the difference between 7 and 5 ($2$) rather than the sum. This often happens with students who use a "guess and check" approach to factorising and confuse the two processes.
*   **Option C (The "Ignore Signs" Trap):** These students treat all numbers as positive, often just memorising that $m \times m = m^2$ and $5+7=12$ and $5 \times 7=35$, ignoring the operators entirely.

**Predicted Distributions:**

**below_basic:** A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
*Students at this level often guess or pick C because they don't like dealing with negatives. Many pick D because the "minus" look of the question makes a negative constant feel right.*

**basic:** A=15% B=40% C=10% D=35%
*These students know how to expand but are highly prone to the sign error in the final term (Option D). They have moved past just adding everything (C).*

**proficient:** A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
*These students are reliable with the method but can still make a "silly mistake" under exam pressure, usually by forgetting that $-5 \times -7 = +35$.*

**advanced:** A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%
*High-achieving Year 9s will spot the double negative instantly. Errors here are almost exclusively due to Rushing or misreading the letters.*
