To solve $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, students must find a common denominator (usually $2x$). This requires doubling the numerator of the second fraction: $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$ (Option A).

**Common Errors observed in Year 9 scripts:**
*   **The "Add Across" Error (B):** Adding the numerators ($3+4=7$) and the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). This is the most common misconception for students who treat fractions like integers.
*   **The "Double Denominator" Error (D):** Students recognize the common denominator is $2x$, but forget to multiply the numerator of the second fraction, leading to $(3+4)/2x$.
*   **The "Half-Correct" Algebra (C):** Students correctly double the $4$ to $8$ and add to $3$ to get $11$, but then incorrectly "simplify" the denominator by removing the coefficient or "cancelling" the $2$.
