As a UK maths teacher, I see this as a classic "barrier" question. While the algebra involved is relatively standard, the presence of a decimal ($0.5$), the subtraction of a negative result, and the rearrangement required often trip up Year 9 students.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 student, this is slightly above midway difficulty. It’s not just "plug and play" because the student has to substitute into $y$, not $x$, and then deal with a multi-step linear equation involving decimals. 

**The Trap:** Most students who get this wrong will succumb to **High Misconception Activation**. They will likely subtract $3$ from $30$ instead of adding it, or they will incorrectly handle the division by $10$.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**The Correct Working:**
1. Substitute $y = 0.5$: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30$
2. Rearrange: $10x = 33$
3. Solve: $x = 3.3$ (**Answer C**)

#### Below Basic (Working below Grade 4)
*Students at this level struggle with the negative sign or confuse $x$ and $y$. Many will perform $10 \times 0.5$ instead of $6 \times 0.5$.*
*   **A=40%** (Calculated $30 + 10(0.5) = 35$, then perhaps divided by something or guessed.)
*   **B=10%** (Random negative guess.)
*   **C=15%** (Lucky guess or basic intuition.)
*   **D=35%** (Calculated $30 - 3 = 27$, then divided by $10$ to get $2.7$. This is the most common error: forgetting that subtracting a term becomes addition on the other side.)

#### Basic (Grade 4 target)
*Students understand substitution but often make a sign error when moving the $-3$ across the equals sign.*
*   **A=10%**
*   **B=10%**
*   **C=30%** (Starting to master the balance method.)
*   **D=50%** (The "subtract to solve" misconception is very strong here: $30 - 3 = 27$.)

#### Proficient (Grade 5/6 target)
*Students are comfortable with two-step equations and decimal multiplication. They usually remember to add $3$ to $30$.*
*   **A=5%**
*   **B=5%**
*   **C=80%** (Should navigate the steps accurately.)
*   **D=10%** (Slip-up on the inverse operation.)

#### Advanced (Grade 7+ target)
*These students treat this as a "fluency" check. The only risk is a "silly" calculation error.*
*   **A=1%**
*   **B=1%**
*   **C=96%**
*   **D=2%**

### Teacher's Note: Why Option D is the "Confidently Wrong" Answer
In the UK curriculum, Year 9s are often taught the "Change the side, change the sign" rule. However, many students see the minus sign in $10x - 6y$ and intuitively think the relationship involves "taking away" from 30 to find $x$. Option D ($2.7$) is a high-distractor because $30 - 3 = 27$ "feels" cleaner to a student than $30 + 3 = 33$.
