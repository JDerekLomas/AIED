As a UK maths teacher, I would classify this as a "high-distractor" question. It doesn’t just test the ability to solve an equation; it tests the understanding of **equivalent operations** and the **distributive property** of multiplication over subtraction.

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 student, solving the equation linearly is around a 4/10. However, evaluating Katie’s specific claim moves this into a higher difficulty bracket. Most students are taught a specific "flow" (add 5, then multiply by 3). Katie’s method (multiplying everything by 3 first) is mathematically valid but frequently executed incorrectly by students (who would typically forget to multiply the -5), leading to a high "confidence" in the wrong answer.

**Correct Answer: A (Only Tom)**
*   **Tom** is correct because adding 5 to both sides is the standard next step.
*   **Katie** is incorrect because if you multiply the equation by 3, you must multiply *every term*. Her line should have been $x - 15 = 36$.

### Predicted Response Distributions

| Group | A (Only Tom) | B (Only Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 15% | **55%** | 10% |
| **Basic** | 35% | 10% | **45%** | 10% |
| **Proficient** | **60%** | 5% | 30% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | **85%** | 2% | 10% | 3% |

### Analysis of the Distributions:

*   **Below Basic/Basic:** These students will demonstrate a massive preference for **Option C**. This is a classic "Misconception Activation." They see that $12 \times 3 = 36$ and that the fraction $\frac{x}{3}$ has been cleared, so it *looks* right to them. They fail to notice that the $-5$ remained unchanged. They are often "confidently wrong."
*   **Proficient:** This group is the most interesting. Many will pause at Katie's suggestion. Some will realise she forgot to multiply the 5, but a significant portion (roughly 30%) will succumb to the "it looks like a valid move" trap. They know Tom is right, so they are choosing between A and C.
*   **Advanced:** These students usually check the "legality" of the move by substituting a value or by mentally applying the bracket expansion rule: $3(\frac{x}{3} - 5) = 12 \times 3 \rightarrow x - 15 = 36$. They will correctly identify Tom as the only valid voice.

**Teacher's Note:** This is an excellent diagnostic question to use before teaching "equations with brackets" or "clearing denominators." It highlights exactly which students treat equations as "moving things" versus "doing the same thing to both sides."
