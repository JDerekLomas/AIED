As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. On the surface, it is a simple one-step linear equation. However, because it involves a unit fraction, it acts as a "wolf in sheep's clothing."

In a Year 9 classroom, this is a high-misconception question. Students are far more likely to "confidently get it wrong" than to guess randomly. They see the numbers 3 and 12 and their brains immediately hunt for 4, 9, or 36, but the positional relationship often trips them up.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While "completing the square" (10/10) involves more procedural steps, this question has a much higher "trap density" for a Year 9 student than a standard equation like $3p = 12$ (which would be a 2/10).

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working toward Grade 2/3):**
*Focus: Inverse operations and "number bonds" mindset.*
*   **A=40% B=15% C=30% D=15%**
*   **Analysis:** Many will see 3 and 12 and instinctively perform $12 \div 3 = 4$, ignoring the fact that 12 is the denominator. Option A is the "trap" choice for those who think they are doing the right inverse. Option C is for those who disregard the fraction entirely.

**Basic (Working at Grade 4):**
*Focus: Standard procedures, prone to calculation errors.*
*   **A=45% B=30% C=10% D=15%**
*   **Analysis:** This group knows they need to divide by 3. However, many will mistakenly calculate $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$ as $\frac{3}{12}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{4}$ (Option A). This is a very common "confident error."

**Proficient (Working at Grade 5/6):**
*Focus: Clearer understanding of fractions and balancing.*
*   **A=20% B=65% C=5% D=10%**
*   **Analysis:** Most students here recognise that dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying the denominator by 3 ($12 \times 3 = 36$). Those who get it wrong usually do so because they rushed and fell for the "looks like 4" bait in Option A.

**Advanced (Working at Grade 7+):**
*Focus: Fluidity with reciprocals and algebraic manipulation.*
*   **A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%**
*   **Analysis:** High-achieving Year 9s should spot this immediately. The only errors here would be "silly" slips or misreading the question as $p/3 = 1/12$.

### Teacher's Note: The Misconception Activation
The danger here is **Option A**. In a typical classroom, I would expect a lively debate between those choosing A and B. The "A" group believes they have followed the rule ("Divide by 3"), but they have not mastered the division of a fraction by an integer. Option B requires the student to understand that $1/12 \div 3$ actually results in a *smaller* value, not a larger one.
