As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It is a classic "trap" question that targets the hierarchical nature of BIDMAS (Order of Operations). While the calculation is simple, the psychological pull to process left-to-right is incredibly strong for Year 9 students.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a Year 9 student, the arithmetic itself is difficulty 2, but the logical application under "exam pressure" elevates this. It sits at a 6 because it triggers a **high misconception activation**. Students won’t guess randomly; they will calculate two different values with high confidence, even if one is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of operational priority.

### PREDICTED RESPONSE DISTRIBUTIONS

**The "Trap":**
*   **Left Side:** Many will do $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$. (Incorrect, should be $8 + 3 = \mathbf{11}$).
*   **Right Side:** Brackets first: $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$. (Correct).
*   **The Misconception:** If a student calculates the left side as 5 and the right side as 5, they will confidently choose **C (=)**.

#### **below_basic (Working at KS2 levels/Year 7 entry)**
*   **A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%**
*   *Rationale:* Almost all students in this bracket will perform operations from left to right. They see the numbers are the same on both sides and, regardless of the bracket, assume they resolve to the same value.

#### **basic (Targeting GCSE Grade 2/3)**
*   **A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%**
*   *Rationale:* This group "knows" BIDMAS exists but struggles to apply it when the "easier" operation (addition) comes first. They are still highly likely to fall for the $20 \div 4 = 5$ trap on the left.

#### **proficient (Targeting GCSE Grade 5/6)**
*   **A=65% B=10% C=20% D=5%**
*   *Rationale:* These students have had the BIDMAS "lecture" enough times to hesitate. They will correctly identify the left side as $8 + 3 = 11$ and the right side as $20 \div 4 = 5$. Since $11 > 5$, they will choose A. The 20% choosing C represents those who make a "silly mistake" under time pressure.

#### **advanced (Targeting GCSE Grade 8/9)**
*   **A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%**
*   *Rationale:* Top-set Year 9s see this as a "spot the trick" question. They will instinctively look for the operation hierarchy. Errors here are usually due to extreme rushing rather than lack of knowledge.

### Teacher's Note:
This is a "high-confidence, low-accuracy" question for middle-ability sets. When reviewing the answer, the "Ooh!" moment in the classroom is usually quite loud as they realize they ignored the division priority on the left-hand side.
