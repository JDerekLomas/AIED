As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question as a classic "diagnostic" trap. It doesn't test the full process of FOIL or grid expansion; instead, it targets the specific operational rules that often derail students mid-calculation.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10

**Teacher’s Rationale:**
In a Year 9 context, this isn't mathematically complex, but it is high in **misconception activation**. While expanding brackets is a standard Year 8/9 skill, students frequently "trip" over the signage and the operation. This is a question where students are often **confident but wrong**. They see two numbers and their brain instinctively performs an operation—often addition instead of multiplication, or neglecting the signs.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to categories (Year 9 UK context):**
*   **Below Basic:** Working towards a Grade 1/2. Struggling with basic directed numbers.
*   **Basic:** Solid Grade 3. Can expand $(x+3)(x+4)$ but hits a wall with negatives.
*   **Proficient:** Target Grade 5/6. Understands the FOIL/Grid method well.
*   **Advanced:** Target Grade 7+. Mastery of algebraic manipulation.

| Category | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 15% | 15% | **60%** |
| **Basic** | 25% | **45%** | 5% | 25% |
| **Proficient** | **70%** | 20% | 2% | 8% |
| **Advanced** | **98%** | 2% | 0% | 0% |

### Analysis of the Mistakes:

*   **Choice D (-5):** The most common error for **Below Basic** students. They see "1" and "4" and perform addition because they struggle with the concept that "expanding" requires multiplication. They keep the negative sign because "the numbers are negative."
*   **Choice B (-4):** The "Common Slip." This is very common among **Basic** students who know they must multiply ($1 \times 4 = 4$), but haven't mastered the rule that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive. They often think, "There are minus signs, so the answer is minus."
*   **Choice C (+5):** Rare, but chosen by students who add the numbers and correctly apply the (incorrectly placed) rule that two negatives make a plus.
*   **Choice A (+4):** The correct answer. **Proficient** students have moved past the "adding instead of multiplying" hurdle and correctly apply directed number rules. **Advanced** students find this trivial but occasionally drop a mark if they are rushing.
