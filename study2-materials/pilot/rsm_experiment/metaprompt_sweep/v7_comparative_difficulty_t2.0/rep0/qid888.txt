This is a classic "bread and butter" topic for the KS3 curriculum. Expanding double brackets is typically introduced in Year 8 and solidified in Year 9.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10

While it requires multiple steps (FOIL or the Grid Method), the algebra itself is linear. The primary challenge here isn't the process of multiplication, but **directed number arithmetic**. Year 9 students often "confidently get it wrong" because they remember the algebra steps but slip up on the signs—specifically, the "double negative" for the constant term and the "addition of negatives" for the coefficient of $m$.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key Misconceptions:**
*   **A ($m^2 - 2m - 35$):** This represents a student "finding the difference" between 7 and 5 for the middle term and failing the negative multiplication rules for the end.
*   **C ($m^2 + 12m + 35$):** The student knows that a negative times a negative is a positive, but wrongly applies that logic to the *addition* of $-5m$ and $-7m$.
*   **D ($m^2 - 12m - 35$):** The most common error. The student adds the negatives correctly for the middle term but fails the "negative $\times$ negative = positive" rule for the constant.

#### below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%
*These students are likely guessing or applying incorrect sign rules across the board. They often think $-5 + -7$ is $+12$ or that $-5 \times -7$ must be negative because there are "so many minus signs."*

#### basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
*These students have the "FOIL" or "Grid" method down but are prone to a single sign error. Option D is a very "sticky" distractor here; they get the $-12m$ but lapse on the final $-5 \times -7$.*

#### proficient: A=5% B=85% C=0% D=10%
*These students are fluent in double bracket expansion. Most errors will be due to rushing or a "slip of the pen" on the final sign. Option C is almost never picked here as they know the middle term must be negative.*

#### advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0% D=1%
*At this level, the process is automated. Only an extreme lapse in concentration leads to an incorrect answer. They will often perform this expansion mentally in seconds.*

**Correct Answer: B**
$(m \times m) + (m \times -7) + (-5 \times m) + (-5 \times -7)$
$= m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35$
$= m^2 - 12m + 35$
