This is a classic "Year 9 litmus test" question. On the surface, it is a straightforward arithmetic calculation, but it is riddled with "distractor traps" that exploit common fragile mental models regarding fractions.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10

While "completing the square" (Difficulty 10) requires a multi-step algebraic process, this question only requires basic numeracy. However, it rates higher than a 2 or 3 because it requires finding a common denominator (unlike simple addition) and handling mixed numbers. In a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class, the struggle isn't the "maths"; it’s the **instruction literacy** (ignoring the "mixed number" requirement) and **misconception activation** (adding denominators).

### PREDICTED RESPONSE DISTRIBUTIONS

*   **A ($99/20$):** The "Mathematically Correct but Instructionally Blind" choice. Students convert to improper fractions and add correctly, but fail to convert back.
*   **B ($4 \frac{19}{20}$):** The correct answer.
*   **C ($99/40$):** The "Double Error" choice. These students try to use improper fractions but add the denominators together ($20+20=40$).
*   **D ($4 \frac{8}{14}$):** The "Lazy Adder" misconception. Adding the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), adding the numerators ($7+1=8$), and adding the denominators ($10+4=14$). This is the most common lower-set error.

#### **Below Basic (Working at Grade 1-2)**
*These students struggle with the concept of a common denominator. They will almost instinctively add across the top and bottom.*
**A=5% B=15% C=20% D=60%**

#### **Basic (Working at Grade 3)**
*These students know they need a common denominator but often get lost in the process or forget to simplify. Option D remains a strong "temptation" if they are rushing.*
**A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%**

#### **Proficient (Working at Grade 4-5)**
*The "typical" Year 9 student. They know how to do the math, but many will ignore the "Leave as a mixed number" instruction or make a small calculation error when converting to 20ths.*
**A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%**

#### **Advanced (Working at Grade 6+)**
*High confidence and high accuracy. The only errors here are "silly" slips or potentially choosing A because they stopped working the moment they hit a correct numerical value.*
**A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%**

### Teacher's Insight:
The "danger" in this question isn't the difficulty; it's the **distractor D**. In a low-stakes environment, up to 40% of a Year 9 cohort will choose D because it "looks right" visually. Option A acts as a filter for students who follow algorithms (converting to improper) rather than looking for the most efficient path (adding whole numbers and fractions separately).
