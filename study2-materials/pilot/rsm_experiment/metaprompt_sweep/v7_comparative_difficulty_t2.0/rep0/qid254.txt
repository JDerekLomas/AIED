As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it doesn't test the **calculation** of the mean, but rather the **structural understanding** of mathematical notation and the role of zero.

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
For a Year 9 class, this is harder than it looks. While "finding the mean" is a primary school skill (Difficulty 3), this question specifically targets two high-frequency misconceptions:
1.  **The "Zero doesn't count" fallacy:** Students often ignore 0 when counting the number of items ($n$).
2.  **Order of Operations (BIDMAS) in linear notation:** Students often forget that a fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol, whereas a linear string of operations requires brackets.

**Option A** is the correct answer (mathematically equivalent to $(0+1+3+4+7) \div 5$).
**Option B** is the "BIDMAS Trap" (only the 7 is being divided by 5).
**Option C** is the "Zero doesn't count" trap.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic:** These students focus on "doing" the mean. They often think zero is "nothing," so they discount it from the denominator. They are very likely to pick C.
**Basic:** These students know they need to divide by 5, but their understanding of notation is weak. They will see the correct numbers in A and B and may pick B because it "looks like" a calculation they would type into a basic calculator (often forgetting that the calculator would then give the wrong answer).
**Proficient:** These students recognize that 0 must be included in the count. They are the group most likely to fall for the BIDMAS trap (B) because they understand the *logic* of the mean but are still shaky on formal algebraic priority.
**Advanced:** These students spot that A is mathematically sound (as adding 0 doesn't change the numerator) and recognize that B is incorrect due to the order of operations.

| Level | A (Correct) | B (BIDMAS Trap) | C (n=4 Trap) | D (Distractor) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 20% | **60%** | 5% |
| **Basic** | 30% | **40%** | 25% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | **55%** | 30% | 10% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | **95%** | 2% | 1% | 2% |

### Teacher's Verdict:
This is a **high-misconception** question. Most students will answer confidently, but a significant portion of the mid-range will be "confidently wrong." Specifically, the transition from **C** to **B** to **A** represents a clear journey of mathematical maturity in a Year 9 classroom.
