This is a classic "subject-rearrangement" task embedded within a geometry context. For a Year 9 student, this is significantly more challenging than a standard numerical volume calculation because it requires **three distinct layers of fluency**: recalling/identifying the correct formula, applying algebraic inverse operations, and managing nested fractions/radicals.

### DIFFICULTY: 8/10
While "completing the square" (the 10/10 benchmark) involves a multi-step procedure, this question tests a student's ability to manipulate variables under a cube root. For most Year 9s, the "look" of the answers (the "maths-phobia" factor) makes this very intimidating.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key Misconceptions:**
*   **The Multiplier Trap:** Many students struggle to decide whether the $4\pi$ or the $3$ goes on top. They often mistakenly "multiply by the top and divide by the bottom" incorrectly when rearranging $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.
*   **Visual Distractors:** Option A appeals to those who remember the formula but simply shove the variables together without performing inverse operations.
*   **The Root Boundary:** Option D is the "false friend" for students who think the cube root only applies to the $V$ rather than the whole expression.

| Level | A | B | C (Correct) | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 45% | 20% | 15% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 30% | 25% | 25% | 20% |
| **Proficient** | 10% | 15% | 60% | 15% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 3% | 93% | 2% |

### Analysis by Group:

*   **Below Basic:** These students will gravitate toward **A**. It "looks" most like the volume formula ($4\pi$ and $3$ are present). They often guess based on visual familiarity rather than performing algebraic steps.
*   **Basic:** This group knows they need to "move" things, but they often get the reciprocal wrong. They might multiply by 4 and divide by 3. Their choice between **B and C** is effectively a 50/50 coin flip, but they often get distracted by **D** because it looks "cleaner."
*   **Proficient:** These students will write down $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ and attempt to solve for $r$. The most common error here is a "slippage" in algebra, such as dividing by 4 and then failing to realise the 3 moves to the numerator. They are likely to reach the correct answer but may hesitate at the radical.
*   **Advanced:** High-performing Year 9s will treat this as a standard Literal Equation problem. They will identify $r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$ almost instantly and look for the cube root. The only risk is a "silly mistake" or misreading the options.
