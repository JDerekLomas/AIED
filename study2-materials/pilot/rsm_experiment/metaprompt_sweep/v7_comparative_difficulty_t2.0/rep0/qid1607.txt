This is a classic "lure" question that identifies whether a student understands inverse operations or is simply moving numbers around using half-remembered rules.

In Step 1, the student correctly multiplies by 4. In Step 2, the student sees a positive 1 and incorrectly adds it to the other side to "get rid of it," rather than subtracting it. This is a very common "high misconception activation" point.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
For a Year 9 student, the algebra itself is foundational (Level 4/5), but because the question is presented as an "error analysis" task, it requires a higher level of metacognition than just solving the equation themselves. It specifically targets the most common error in two-step equations.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working toward Year 7 targets)**
*These students struggle with the initial multiplication and often guess based on "looks right." Many will assume the whole process is wrong because they don't recognize the first step.*
A=15% B=20% C=25% **D=40%**

**Basic (Standard Year 8/low Year 9 ability)**
*This group typically falls for the trap. They recognize Step 1 is correct but make the same sign error as Isaac in Step 2, leading them to believe both steps are valid.*
A=25% B=5% **C=60%** D=10%

**Proficient (Securing Year 9 targets / GCSE Grade 4-5)**
*These students are beginning to double-check work. They will likely re-solve the equation on paper, spot that $k$ should be $59$, and identify Step 2 as the error. However, a significant portion will still rush and pick C.*
**A=65%** B=2% C=30% D=3%

**Advanced (Working at Grade 7-9 level)**
*These students see the trap immediately. They verify each operation independently and are rarely caught out by sign errors in multi-choice formats.*
**A=95%** B=0% C=4% D=1%

### Teacher’s Analysis:
*   **The Trap:** The move from $60 = 1 + k$ to $61 = k$ is the "confident error." Students often think "1 is positive, so 60 + 1 = 61." 
*   **The Results:** If this were a class test, I would expect the modal answer to be **C** for a mid-set Year 9 class, which allows for a great "Why are we all wrong?" discussion during feedback. Only your top 30% of students typically avoid the impulse to agree with Step 2.
