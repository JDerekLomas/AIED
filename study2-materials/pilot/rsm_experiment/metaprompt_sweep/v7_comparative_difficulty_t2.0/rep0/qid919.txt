As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It isn’t difficult in terms of the operations required, but it is a "minefield" for decimal place value and order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). 

The key misconception here is **"Square then multiply" vs "Multiply then square"**, compounded by the common error that **$0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$**.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a Year 9 student, this ranks higher than it looks. While "completing the square" (your 10/10) requires a complex multi-step algorithm, this question requires navigating three distinct conceptual hurdles simultaneously: indices on decimals, place value, and BIDMAS. Many students will "confidently" get this wrong.

### PREDICTED RESPONSE DISTRIBUTIONS

**Logic behind the options:**
*   **A ($0.81$):** The "Order of Operations" error. Student does $(3 \times 0.3)^2$, resulting in $0.9^2$.
*   **B ($0.27$):** The **Correct** answer. $0.3^2 = 0.09$, then $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$.
*   **C ($1.8$):** The "Multiplication" error. Student squares the coefficient ($3^2 = 9$) and multiplies by $x$ ($0.2$), or simply doubles $0.3$ and triples it. 
*   **D ($2.7$):** The "Decimal Point" error. Student knows $3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27$ but calculates $0.3^2$ as $0.9$ (instead of $0.09$). This is the most "attractive" wrong answer for mid-range students.

| Group | A (Distractor) | B (Correct) | C (Random/Err) | D (Misconception) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 15% | 35% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 25% | 10% | 40% |
| **Proficient** | 15% | 55% | 5% | 25% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | 90% | 0% | 5% |

### Teacher's Commentary:
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the notation $3x^2$ entirely. Many will simply add the numbers or multiply $3 \times 0.3$ and stop, or guess C.
*   **Basic:** This is the high-misconception zone. They know they need to "do something" with a square. A huge number of these students will say $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then $0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$. They will select **D** with 100% confidence.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually remember to square first, but about a quarter will still fall into the $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ trap.
*   **Advanced:** Most will recognise the decimal place trap ($0.09$) and correctly calculate $0.27$. Those who fail here usually do so by rushing and selecting A due to a momentary BIDMAS lapse.
