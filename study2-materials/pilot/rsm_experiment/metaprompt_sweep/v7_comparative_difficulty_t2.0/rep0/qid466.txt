As a UK maths teacher, I see this as a classic "low floor, high ceiling" diagnostic question. It tests three distinct areas of Year 9 fluency: fraction multiplication, the concept of a multiplicative inverse (reciprocal), and the rules of directed numbers (signs).

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this sits at a 6. While the arithmetic is simple, the "trap" density is high. Students often perform one transformation correctly (inverting the fraction) while neglecting the second (the sign), leading to a high rate of confident but incorrect answers.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working toward Grade 2/3)**
*Students in this tier often struggle with the "mechanics" of what -1 signifies. Many will assume they need the "same" number to get a result or will simply ignore the negative signs entirely.*
*   **A: 20%** | **B: 20%** | **C: 30%** | **D: 30%**
*   **Rationale:** Guessing is high here. D is a popular "visual" match, and C represents a misunderstanding that a negative times a positive equals a negative, but they forget to flip the fraction.

**Basic (Working at Grade 4/GCSE Foundation)**
*These students know that $3/4 \times 4/3 = 1$. This makes Option A the "super-distractor." They identify the reciprocal but suffer from "Sign Fatigue"—they see a minus in the question and a minus in the answer and assume the middle number must be positive.*
*   **A: 55%** | **B: 25%** | **C: 10%** | **D: 10%**
*   **Rationale:** High confidence in getting it wrong. They perform the "flip" and stop thinking.

**Proficient (Working at Grade 6/GCSE Higher)**
*These students have mastered directed numbers. They know that to get a negative answer, the signs must be different. They will pause and check: "Negative $\times$ Positive = Negative."*
*   **A: 80%** | **B: 10%** | **C: 5%** | **D: 5%**
*   **Rationale:** This is where the highest accuracy is found. The "Basic" error is identified and avoided.

**Advanced (Working at Grade 8/9)**
*These students treat it as an algebraic rearrangement ($x = -1 \div -3/4$). They are less likely to make sign errors because they verify their answer by substitution.*
*   **A: 95%** | **B: 3%** | **C: 1%** | **D: 1%**
*   **Rationale:** Only "silly" slips in mental calculation lead to errors here.

### Teacher's Note on Misconceptions:
**Option A** is the "Confidence Trap." In my experience, if you ask this to a middle-set Year 9 class, more than half will circle **A** within five seconds. They correctly identify that they need the reciprocal to get "1", but their brains bypass the sign logic because they are so satisfied with finding the $4/3$.
