As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It is a classic "wolf in sheep’s clothing." While it looks simple, it targets a fundamental misunderstanding of algebraic structure and the "division is commutative" myth.

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**
For a Year 9 student, this is significantly harder than it looks. While "completing the square" (10/10) is procedurally complex, this question is conceptually tricky. Students often operate on "autopilot" with one-step equations. If the variable is on the denominator, their mental heuristic often defaults to "take the two numbers and divide the big one by the small one."

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**The Misconception (The "Confidence" Trap):**
The primary distractor here is **C ($p=2$)**. Students see $10$ and $5$; they know $10 \div 5 = 2$. They often rewrite the equation mentally as $p = 10 \div 5$. Because $2$ is an integer and a "nice" number, they select it with high confidence.

**A ($p=0.5$)** is the correct answer, found by multiplying by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, then $p = 5/10$.

| Group | A (Correct) | B (Multiply) | C (The Swap) | D (Giving up) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 5% | 40% | 45% | 10% |
| **Basic** | 20% | 15% | 60% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 55% | 5% | 38% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 92% | 1% | 7% | 0% |

### **Teacher’s Commentary on the Distributions:**

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the operation itself. They might see "divide" and decide to do the opposite (multiply), leading them to $10 \times 5 = 50$ (Option B).
*   **Basic:** This is the most dangerous category for this specific question. These students are comfortable with basic equations like $2p=10$ or $p/2=10$. Because they are used to "big $\div$ small," they will jump at **Option C** ($10 \div 5 = 2$) without testing the result. This is a classic "confident wrong" group.
*   **Proficient:** These students have started to learn that when the unknown is "downstairs," you must multiply it out first. However, under timed conditions, a large chunk (approx. 38%) will still fall into the $10 \div 5$ trap because it feels more "natural" than $5 \div 10$.
*   **Advanced:** These students recognise the reciprocal nature of the equation or accurately perform the two-step rearrangement ($10p=5 \rightarrow p=0.5$). The few who get it wrong usually make a silly arithmetic slip rather than a conceptual one.
