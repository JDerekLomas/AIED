As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this as a classic "trap" question. It targets one of the most persistent misconceptions in Key Stage 3: the rigid, literal interpretation of the acronym **BIDMAS** (or BODMAS/PEMDAS).

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
While the arithmetic itself is Year 4 level, the conceptual hurdle is significant for Year 9. Many students "confidently get it wrong" because they follow the letter of the law (Addition comes before Subtraction in the acronym) rather than the mathematical principle (Addition and Subtraction have equal priority).

*   **Problem P Trap:** Many students believe you **must** do Addition before Subtraction. They see $+ 6$ and want to pair it with $5$, often incorrectly resulting in $4 - 11$.
*   **Problem Q Trap:** This is the standard order of operations test; most Year 9s know Multiplication beats Addition, but "below basic" students still read left-to-right.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to options:**
*   **B (Correct):** Follows left-to-right for P; follows priority for Q.
*   **D (The "BIDMAS Trap"):** Treats addition as higher priority than subtraction for P; follows priority for Q.
*   **A (Left-to-Right bias):** Just calculates in the order written.

| Cohort | A | B (Correct) | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 45% | 15% | 5% | 35% |
| **Basic** | 20% | 35% | 5% | 40% |
| **Proficient** | 5% | 65% | 0% | 30% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 95% | 0% | 3% |

### Teacher's Commentary on the Distributions:

*   **Below Basic:** These students generally ignore BIDMAS and work left-to-right (Option A). They feel successful because $4-5+6$ is "easy" if you just go in order.
*   **Basic:** This is the most interesting group. These students have been taught BIDMAS but haven't mastered the "Equal Priority" rule. Because **A**ddition comes before **S**ubtraction in the name, they will gravitate heavily toward **Option D**. They are "confidently wrong."
*   **Proficient:** Most have been corrected on the $A/S$ priority rule, but under exam pressure, a significant chunk (roughly 30%) will still fall back on the literal BIDMAS acronym and choose **Option D**.
*   **Advanced:** These students recognise that Addition/Subtraction are inverse operations and move left-to-right (or treat it as $4 + -5 + 6$). They will almost all select **Option B**.
