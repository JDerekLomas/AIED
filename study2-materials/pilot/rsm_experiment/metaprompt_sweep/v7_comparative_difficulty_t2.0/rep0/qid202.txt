As an experienced UK maths teacher, I would categorize this as a **"confidence trap"** question.

For a Year 9 student (13-14 years old), the arithmetic itself is relatively simple because the denominators are the same. However, the presence of distractions—specifically the request for a "mixed number" versus an equivalent improper fraction, and the classic "add the denominators" misconception—creates a specific spread of results.

### DIFFICULTY: 3/10
While "3" seems low, it sits there because the denominators are common. If they were different ($2 \frac{1}{2} + 1 \frac{1}{3}$), the difficulty would jump to a 6 or 7.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to responses:**
*   **A (Correct):** Followed the steps, read the instruction for a mixed number.
*   **B (Misinterpretation):** Correct mathematical value, but failed to provide a mixed number (Improper fraction).
*   **C (Compounded Error):** Added numerators and denominators, and converted incorrectly/ignored whole numbers.
*   **D (The Classic Misconception):** Added the whole numbers (3) and numerators (3), but also added the denominators (10).

| Group | A (Correct) | B (Improper) | C (Random/Err) | D (Add Denoms) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 10% | 30% | 40% |
| **Basic** | 55% | 15% | 5% | 25% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 10% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0% | 1% |

### Teacher’s Analysis:

1.  **The "D" Trap:** Students in the "Below Basic" and "Basic" tiers have a high "misconception activation" here. They see an operation and apply it to every number they see. Adding $5+5$ to get $10$ is the most common error in fraction addition globally.
2.  **The "B" Distractor:** Advanced and Proficient students often default to improper fractions because that is how they are taught to handle complex calculations. A significant handful will do the math correctly as $18/5$ and tick B immediately without re-reading the "mixed number" constraint.
3.  **Performance Gap:** In Year 9, fractions are a "marker" topic. Students who understand the concept of a "whole" will find this trivial (Difficulty 2). Students who view fractions as two separate numbers separated by a line will find this highly confusing (Difficulty 6).
