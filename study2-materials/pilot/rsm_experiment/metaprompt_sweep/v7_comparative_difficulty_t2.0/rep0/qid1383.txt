As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it perfectly illustrates the gap between procedural knowledge and conceptual mastery of directed numbers and index notation.

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this sits at a **6**. While the arithmetic itself is simple, the question is a "minefield" of potential misconceptions. It tests three distinct areas: powers of negative numbers, index vs. coefficient confusion ($3^4$ vs $3 \times 4$), and the specific convention of how negatives are handled in squaring/powing.

This is a classic "High Misconception" question. Students won't guess randomly; they will calculate an answer they feel confident in, unaware that they have missed a sign rule or misapplied an operation.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Year 9 Performance Levels (UK context):**
*   **Below Basic:** Students working significantly below age-related expectations (Level 3/4).
*   **Basic:** Students beginning to grasp algebra but shaky on negatives (Level 5).
*   **Proficient:** Secure at age-related expectations (Level 6).
*   **Advanced:** Targeting Grade 8/9 at GCSE (Level 7/8+).

| Level | A (81) | B (12) | C (-81) | D (-12) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 35% | 15% | **40%** |
| **Basic** | 25% | 15% | **45%** | 15% |
| **Proficient** | **65%** | 5% | 25% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | **95%** | 0% | 5% | 0% |

### Teacher's Commentary on the "Why":

*   **The Case for D (-12):** At the **Below Basic** level, the most common error is the confusion between index and multiplication ($k \times 4$). These students see $-3$ and $4$, and immediately compute $-3 \times 4 = -12$.
*   **The Case for C (-81):** This is the most dangerous distractor for **Basic/Proficient** students. They know that $3^4 = 81$, but they possess a shaky "shortcut" rule that says "if there is a minus in the question, there's a minus in the answer." Even more common: students who use a scientific calculator correctly for most things but type `-3^4` into it—the calculator follows BIDMAS and calculates $-(3^4)$, yielding $-81$. Without brackets, they are doomed.
*   **The Case for B (12):** Less common than -12, but chosen by students who ignore signs entirely until the very end, or think $k^4$ means $k \times 4$ but forget the negative.
*   **The Correct Answer (81):** To get this right, a student must consciously write $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$. They must pair the negatives: $(-3 \times -3) = 9$ and $(9 \times 9) = 81$. Advanced students recognise the rule: *Any negative base raised to an even power yields a positive result.*
