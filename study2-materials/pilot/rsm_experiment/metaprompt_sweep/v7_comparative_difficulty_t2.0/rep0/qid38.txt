As a UK maths teacher, I would place this question firmly in the **middle-tier of GCSE Foundation/Higher crossover** material. For a Year 9 class, it bridges the gap between numerical fraction arithmetic and algebraic manipulation.

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**

**Teacher’s Analysis:**
This is a classic "trap" question. Students often have a high level of false confidence here. They see "addition" and "fractions" and immediately apply a "top + top, bottom + bottom" logic if they aren't thinking algebraically.

*   **Option A (The Correct Answer):** Requires the student to find a common denominator ($2x$). They must scale the second fraction by $2/2$ to get $8/2x$, then add the numerators.
*   **Option B (The "Add Everything" Misconception):** This is for students who add the numerators ($3+4=7$) and the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). This is the most common "confidently wrong" error.
*   **Option C (The "Forget the 2" Misconception):** Students recognise they need a common denominator but choose $x$, effectively "ignoring" or dividing the $2x$ by 2 without adjusting the numerator.
*   **Option D (The "Miscalculation" error):** Students find the common denominator $2x$, but simply add $3+4$ without scaling the second fraction.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Below Basic (Working at Grade 1-2):**
*These students treat the algebra like a set of independent numbers. Most will simply add across the top and bottom.*
*   **A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%**

**Basic (Working at Grade 3-4):**
*These students know they need a common denominator but struggle with the "balanced" fraction. Many will select $2x$ as the base but forget to double the 4.*
*   **A=30% B=25% C=15% D=30%**

**Proficient (Working at Grade 5-6):**
*The typical Year 9 "On Track" student. They remember the rules for adding fractions. Some might still make a "silly" slip under time pressure (Option D).*
*   **A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%**

**Advanced (Working at Grade 7+):**
*These students see the common denominator $2x$ instantly. They are unlikely to be caught by the distractors unless they misread the '+' for a '×'.*
*   **A=95% B=1% C=2% D=2%**
