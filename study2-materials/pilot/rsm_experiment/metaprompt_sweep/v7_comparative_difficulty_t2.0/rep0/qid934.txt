As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this as a classic "barrier" question. While the arithmetic is simple, the equation is presented in an **implicit form** ($4x + 2y = 10$) rather than the explicit form ($y = mx + c$) that Year 9 students are more comfortable with.

The main challenge here isn't the substitution ($x=0$), but the structural layout of the table and the tendency of students to "guess" a pattern before actually calculating.

### **DIFFICULTY: 4/10**
(It ranks higher than simple substitution because the $2y$ requires a division step, but lower than completing the square because $x=0$ simplifies the expression significantly.)

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Key Misconceptions:**
*   **The "Coefficients" Error:** Some students look at the numbers in the equation ($4$ and $10$) and try to combine them without substituting ($10 \times 4$ or $10 \div 4$).
*   **The "Gradient" Guess:** Students often assume the $y$-intercept is simply the "result" of the equation (10) or mistakenly divide $10$ by the $x$-coefficient ($10/4 = 2.5$).
*   **The Successful Substitution:** Replacing $x$ with $0$ leads to $2y = 10$, which requires dividing by 2 to get $5$.

#### **below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=35% D=40%**
Students in this tier often struggle with the algebraic structure. A significant portion will see the numbers $4, 2, 10$ and assume the answer is $10 \div 4 = 2.5$ (Option D), assuming the $x$ and $y$ values have a simple multiplicative relationship. Option C (the correct answer) will be hit often simply because "5" feels like a mathematically "neat" factor of 10.

#### **basic: A=5% B=10% C=65% D=20%**
At this level, students understand they need to do "something" with the $x=0$. Many will successfully cover up the $4x$ term and see $2y = 10$, correctly identifying $y=5$. However, the distraction of $10 \div 4 = 2.5$ remains a high-activation misconception for those who rush.

#### **proficient: A=2% B=3% C=90% D=5%**
Year 9 students working at a proficient level are accustomed to tables of values. They will instinctively substitute $x=0$, recognize that $4(0)$ disappears, and solve the remaining one-step equation ($2y = 10$).

#### **advanced: A=0% B=1% C=99% D=0%**
Advanced students will find this trivial. They may spend a split second wondering if it’s a trick question because the $x=0$ substitution is so straightforward, but they will almost universally select C.

### **Teacher’s Note on "The Star" placement:**
By placing the star at $x=0$, you are testing the **y-intercept**. If you had placed the star at $x=1$ or $x=2$, the difficulty would jump to a **6/10**, as students would have to deal with subtracting $4x$ from 10 before dividing by 2, introducing significantly more room for computational error.
