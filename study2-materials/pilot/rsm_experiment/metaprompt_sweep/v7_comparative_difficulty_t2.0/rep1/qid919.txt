As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this as a classic "trick" question that targets **Order of Operations (BIDMAS)** and **Place Value** within the context of algebra. 

Many Year 9 students understand the substitution concept but struggle with the mechanics of squaring decimals and the hierarchy of operations. They often perform $(3 \times 0.3)^2$ or simply make a decimal point error.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the substitution itself is "simple," the success rate in a typical mixed-ability Year 9 classroom is surprisingly low due to the high "misconception activation" of the distractors.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to Distractors:**
*   **A (0.81):** The "Incorrect Order of Operations" error. Student does $(3 \times 0.3) = 0.9$, then $0.9^2 = 0.81$.
*   **B (0.27):** The "Correct Logic, Correct Answer." Student does $0.3^2 = 0.09$, then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.
*   **C (1.8):** The "Forgot the Square" error. Student simply does $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$ or treats $x^2$ as $2x$, resulting in $3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$.
*   **D (2.7):** The "Place Value/Mental Maths" error. Student knows $3^3$ is 27 and guesses where the decimal goes, or does $3 \times 0.9$ (failing to square 0.3 correctly as 0.09).

| Group | A | B (Correct) | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 15% | 35% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 40% | 20% | 15% | 25% |
| **Proficient** | 30% | 45% | 5% | 20% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | 90% | 0% | 5% |

### Teacher's Commentary:
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the notation $x^2$. Many will treat it as $x \times 2$, leading them straight to **C**.
*   **Basic:** This is the "danger zone." These students know they need to multiply and square, but they will almost universally do the multiplication first. Option **A** is a very "confident" wrong answer for this group.
*   **Proficient:** Students here know BIDMAS/indices come first. However, the calculation $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$ is a notorious "banana skin." Many will mistakenly think $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, which leads them to answer **D** ($3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$).
*   **Advanced:** Usually comfortable with decimals and the distinction between $3x^2$ and $(3x)^2$. Only rare slips in mental arithmetic would move them away from **B**.
