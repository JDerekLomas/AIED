As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. On the surface, it looks like a simple substitution task, but it contains a "trap" that catches even mid-to-high ability Year 9 students.

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
For a Year 9 student, this is harder than it looks. While "completing the square" (10/10) is algebraically more complex, this question relies on **deciphering an implicit form**. Most Year 9 students are drilled in $y = mx + c$. When they see $4x + 2y = 10$, their instinct is to perform a single operation rather than solve a two-step equation or rearrange.

### Misconception Profile: "The Confidence Trap"
This is not a "random guess" question. This is a **high-misconception question**. 
*   **The $x=0$ trap:** Students see $x=0$ and often assume the answer is simply the constant at the end of the equation ($10$) or half of it without considering the variable coefficient correctly.
*   **The Operation Confusion:** Many will see the $4$, $x$, and $2$, and try to "combine" them into the $10$ incorrectly.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working towards GSCE Grade 1-2):**
*These students often ignore the variables and look for simple arithmetic relationships or pick numbers they see in the equation.*
*   **A (20):** High. They see $4$, $2$, and $10$ and assume multiplication ($4 \times 5 = 20$ or $10 \times 2 = 20$).
*   **C (5):** Common. They see $4x$, ignore it because $x=0$, and see $2y = 10$, but often just guess $10 \div 2$. Wait—C is actually the correct answer. Interestingly, these students often get it right by "accident" through simplified logic.

**Basic (Working towards GCSE Grade 3-4):**
*These students know substitution but struggle with the $2y$.*
*   **A (20):** Lower than below basic, but still present.
*   **B (3):** Low.
*   **C (5):** They usually substitute $0$, get $2y=10$, and divide. This group performs well here because $x=0$ simplifies the expression.
*   **D (2.5):** They might divide $10$ by the $4$.

**Proficient (Working towards GCSE Grade 5-6):**
*The "Danger Zone". These students over-index on $y = mx + c$ patterns.*
*   **C (5):** The vast majority will get this right.
*   **D (2.5):** They try to rearrange to $y = -2x + 5$ but make a mistake and do $10/4$.
*   **B (3):** If they look at the table as a sequence, they might assume a "step" without calculating.

**Advanced (Working towards GCSE Grade 7+):**
*Total fluency.*
*   **C (5):** Should be near 100%. Any error is a "silly" calculation slip.

**DIFFICULTY: 6/10**

**below_basic:** A=40% B=10% C=40% D=10%
*(Note: High "accidental" success rate for C here)*

**basic:** A=15% B=5% C=70% D=10%

**proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%

**advanced:** A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%

### Teacher’s Reflection:
The reason this isn't a 2/10 or 3/10 difficulty is the **format**. If the question asked "Solve $4(0) + 2y = 10$", success would be 90%+. Because it is presented as a **Table of Values**, students look for patterns across the $x$ values first. If the star had been under $x=1$, the difficulty would jump to an 8/10 because it would involve a two-step equation $(4 + 2y = 10)$. Under $x=0$, you are mostly testing their ability to not be intimidated by the $4x$ term.
