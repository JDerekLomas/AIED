As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it targets one of the most persistent misconceptions in secondary education: the literal interpretation of the acronym **BIDMAS/BODMAS**.

### Difficulty Rating: 4/10
While the arithmetic is simple (Year 4/5 level), the conceptual trap regarding the order of operations makes it challenging for a Year 9 student. Many students “confidently get it wrong” because they follow the letters of BIDMAS as a strict hierarchy (Addition *before* Subtraction) rather than treating them as equal priority.

### The Misconception (The "Addition Trap")
*   **Problem P:** Many students believe Addition (A) must happen before Subtraction (S) because A comes before S in the acronym. They will mistakenly choose $5+6$ as the first step.
*   **Problem Q:** Most Year 9s are confident that Multiplication comes before Addition.

**The correct answer is B.** In Problem P, Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and are solved left-to-right. Therefore, $4-5$ is first.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students struggling with numeracy and basic rules.
*   **Basic:** Students who remember the BIDMAS acronym but interpret it literally.
*   **Proficient:** Students who understand equal priority (Left-to-Right rule).
*   **Advanced:** Students with high fluency and conceptual clarity.

| Group | A (Incorrect/Incorrect) | B (Correct/Correct) | C (Incorrect/Incorrect) | D (Incorrect/Correct) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 45% | 10% | 15% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 5% | 15% | 10% | **70%** |
| **Proficient** | 2% | **65%** | 3% | 30% |
| **Advanced** | 0% | **95%** | 0% | 5% |

### Analysis of the Predicted Data:

*   **The "D" Trap (The BIDMAS Literalists):** This will be the most popular answer across a typical Year 9 cohort (the "Basic" group). Students in this category feel very confident. They correctly identify that $5 \times 6$ is first in Problem Q, but their rigid adherence to "A comes before S" leads them to choose $5+6$ for Problem P.
*   **The "A" Error:** This is common among students who don't know BIDMAS at all and simply work left-to-right for everything, ignoring the multiplication rule in Q.
*   **Proficient vs. Advanced:** "Proficient" students usually get this right, but under exam pressure, about 30% of them will revert to the "D" shortcut because it is so deeply ingrained. Only the "Advanced" students have truly moved past the acronym to understand the mathematical properties at play.
