As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question through the lens of **notation vs. calculation**. For a Year 9 student (age 13-14), they have moved past "the basics" of arithmetic and are expected to treat the vinculum (fraction bar) as a grouping symbol.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10

**Teacher’s Rationale:**
While the concept is fundamental, this falls into the "confidently wrong" category for middle-to-lower sets. Students often struggle with the "order of operations" within fractions. The difficulty is not in the maths itself, but in the visual literacy of algebra. It ranks below a 5 because there is no actual calculation required—only recognition.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to tiers:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students working at KS2/early KS3 level (struggle with order of operations).
*   **Basic:** Target Grade 2-3 (can simplify terms but prone to visual distractors).
*   **Proficient:** Target Grade 5 (secure in standard algebraic notation).
*   **Advanced:** Target Grade 7+ (completely fluent).

| Tier | A | B | C | D | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 30% | 15% | 40% | 15% | High selection of **C**. Students see "$+4$" at the end of the original expression and look for a term that ends in "$+4$" regardless of the fraction bar length. |
| **Basic** | 55% | 10% | 15% | 20% | Most recognize the fraction bar as division, but many fall for **D** (the "First-Term-Bottom" flip) or **C** (misunderstanding the denominator scope). |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 2% | 8% | 5% | Most get this correct, but a small minority might still doubt whether the denominator needs the brackets to stay "whole" and choose **C**. |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 0% | 1% | 1% | Trivial for this group; errors are likely "misclicks" or lack of attention to detail. |

### Misconception Activation Profile:

1.  **The "Visual Pattern" Trap (Distractor C):** In the original expression, $+4$ is the last thing written. In C, $+4$ is the last thing written. For students who process maths as a linear string of characters rather than structural units, C is highly attractive.
2.  **The "Commutative Confusion" (Distractor D):** There is a persistent misconception that division can be written in any order, or that the "longer" part of the expression belongs on the top to "hold it up."
3.  **The "Compelling Change" (Distractor B):** Students often feel that "doing algebra" requires changing all the letters/numbers to make it look "more different." B provides a sense of symmetry that can trick the "Below Basic" cohort.
