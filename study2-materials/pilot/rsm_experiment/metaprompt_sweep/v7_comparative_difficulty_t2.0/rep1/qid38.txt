As a UK maths teacher, I would classify this as a **high-misconception question**. 

While Year 9s (ages 13–14) are taught algebraic fractions, many struggle with "algebraic hygiene"—the tendency to apply numeric rules inconsistently when $x$ is involved. The main "trap" here isn't just a lack of knowledge; it is the instinctive urge to add horizontally across the top and the bottom when the denominators look similar but are not identical.

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**
(On your scale, this sits above basic linear equations but below completing the square. It requires two distinct steps: finding a common denominator and accurately summing the numerators.)

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Key to options:**
*   **A ($11/2x$):** Correct. ($\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}$)
*   **B ($7/3x$):** "The Horizontal Adder." Adds $3+4$ and $2x+x$. (Classic misconception).
*   **C ($11/x$):** The "Forgot the 2." Gets the numerator right but simplifies the denominator incorrectly.
*   **D ($7/2x$):** The "Numerator Only." Recognises $2x$ as a denominator but forgets to scale the second fraction.

| Category | A (Correct) | B (Misconception) | C (Partial) | D (Partial) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | **60%** | 10% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 35% | **40%** | 10% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | **75%** | 10% | 5% | 10% |
| **Advanced** | **95%** | 2% | 1% | 2% |

### **Teacher’s Insight:**
*   **Below Basic / Basic:** Option **B** will be the most popular choice. Students at this level often treat algebraic fractions like a "string of numbers." They see $3, 4, 2x, x$ and simply perform $3+4$ and $2+1$ to get $7/3x$. They are "confidently wrong."
*   **Proficient:** These students know they need a common denominator. However, many will succumb to the error in Option **D**—they will change the $x$ to $2x$ in the denominator but forget to multiply the $4$ by $2$, resulting in $(3+4)/2x$.
*   **The Trap:** Unlike many multiple-choice questions where one answer is obviously "random," B, C, and D all correspond to specific, common mental shortcuts taken by Year 9s. I expect a "confident" but low accuracy rate in lower sets.
