This is a classic "conceptual trap" question. It targets a very specific and frequent misconception regarding inverse operations.

In Step 1, the student correctly multiplies by 4. In Step 2, however, the student sees a $+1$ and instinctively performs an addition $(60+1)$ rather than the inverse operation (subtraction, $60-1$). This is a "confident error" rather than a guess.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
For a Year 9 student, the algebra itself is simple (one-step/two-step), but the "spot the mistake" format increases cognitive load. The difficulty lies entirely in the psychological urge to add because they see a plus sign.

### Teacher’s Analysis:

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with "multi-step" logic. They see Step 1 is "correct-ish" and Step 2 "uses the numbers provided," leading them to pick **C**. They are "confidentially wrong"—they believe they have verified both steps because $15 \times 4 = 60$ and $60 + 1 = 61$ are both true arithmetic facts, ignoring the algebraic requirement for inverse operations.
*   **Basic:** This group usually identifies that something is wrong with Step 2, but a significant portion will still fall into the "positive/negative" trap. Many will correctly choose **A** because they have just finished a unit on solving equations and have the phrase "do the opposite" fresh in their minds.
*   **Proficient:** These students rarely fall for this. They will instinctively solve the equation for themselves $(k=59)$ and compare it to Isaac's steps. 
*   **Advanced:** For this group, the question is trivial. They will identify the mistake in Step 2 instantly as a failure to subtract.

**The "High Misconception" factor:** The choice of **C** is the "distractor of death." Students who don't understand that equations must remain balanced will simply check the arithmetic $(60+1=61)$ and assume the logic follows.
