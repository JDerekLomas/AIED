This is a classic "inverted" algebraic equation that targets a specific structural misconception. In my experience, Year 9 students often treat the variable as a multiplier rather than a divisor when it's on the denominator.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10

While the arithmetic is simple (involving 5 and 10), the **conceptual demand** is higher than a standard one-step equation like $10=5p$. The presence of $p$ as a denominator creates a "confident error" pattern.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Rationale:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students see "10" and "5" and perform the most obvious operation: multiplication. They assume the division bar is just "part of the algebra look" and reach $50$.
*   **Basic:** These students understand they need to divide, but they automatically divide the larger number by the smaller number ($10 \div 5 = 2$), failing to recognize that $p$ is the divisor. This is the **most common "confident" mistake.**
*   **Proficient:** These students have mastered "cross-multiplication" or "switching" (knowing that if $a = b/c$, then $c = b/a$). They correctly calculate $5 \div 10$.
*   **Advanced:** These students see the relationship instantly.

| Group | A ($0.5$) | B ($50$) | C ($2$) | D (None) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 50% | 35% | 5% |
| **Basic** | 20% | 15% | 60% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 2% | 12% | 1% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 1% | 0% |

### Teacher's Notes:
Option **C** is the "distractor king" here. Students who get C feel they have done "real maths" because they performed a division ($10/5$), making it a very high-misconception question. To improve Year 9 performance on this, I usually teach them to "multiply up" by $p$ first to get $10p = 5$, turning it into a standard linear equation.
