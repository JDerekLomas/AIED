As a UK maths teacher, I see this as a standard Year 7/8 skill being checked for fluency in Year 9. On the surface, it looks easy because the denominators are the same, but the inclusion of multiple representations and common misconceptions makes it a bit more subtle than it first appears.

### DIFFICULTY: 3/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this is considered a "routine" fluency task. However, the requirement to leave it as a mixed number (A vs B) and the temptation to add denominators (C vs D) will catch out students who are coasting or have shaky foundational concepts.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Students working at KS2/early KS3 levels)**
These students often lack the conceptual model of what a fraction represents. They frequently use "the add everything" strategy—adding the whole numbers and adding both numerators and denominators.
*   **A=15% B=5% C=30% D=50%**
*   *Note: Option D is the "Classic Misconception" where they add denominators (5+5=10). Option C is chosen by those who lose the whole numbers and just perform "sum/sum".*

**Basic (Working toward a Grade 3 at GCSE)**
These students know you don't add denominators, but they often struggle with the instruction "leave as a mixed number." They might convert to improper fractions first and then forget to convert back, or get overwhelmed by choice.
*   **A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%**
*   *Note: A is the leader here, but they are still susceptible to the "add the bottoms" error (D) when rushing.*

**Proficient (Secure Grade 4/5 potential)**
These students have mastered the algorithm. They can see that $2+1=3$ and $\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$ immediately. The main risk here is not reading the "Mixed Number" instruction and choosing B.
*   **A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%**
*   *Note: They will largely ignore C and D as they know denominators must stay the same.*

**Advanced (Aiming for Grade 7-9)**
These students see the answer instantly. The only reason they would get this wrong is through an "eye-slip" or an extremely careless reading of the prompt.
*   **A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%**
*   *Note: Even top students occasionally pick B if they solve by converting to $\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5}$ and fail to do the final conversion.*

### Teacher's Reflection:
This question has **high misconception activation** regarding Option D. In a typical Year 9 classroom, you will always see a handful of hands go up for "denominator addition." The most "dangerous" part of this question isn't the math—it’s the distractors. Most students won't guess randomly; they will confidently calculate $1+2=3, 5+5=10$ and choose D, feeling they have done a good job.
