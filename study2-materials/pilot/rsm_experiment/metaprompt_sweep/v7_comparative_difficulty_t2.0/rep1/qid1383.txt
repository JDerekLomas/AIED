As a UK maths teacher, I find this specific question fascinating. It is a classic "trap" question that tests two distinct things: the mechanical skill of substitution and the conceptual understanding of powers of negative numbers.

For a Year 9 student, the calculation $3^4 = 81$ is usually within their reach, but the interaction between the negative sign and the even exponent is where the majority of errors occur. This is a high "confidence in error" question.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the arithmetic is simple, the misconception activation is very high. It is significantly harder than a standard "find the area of a rectangle" (Difficulty 3-4) but lacks the multi-step complexity of higher-tier algebra (Difficulty 9-10).

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Low prior attainment)**
*These students struggle with powers, often treating them as multiplication ($3 \times 4$). They frequently ignore signs or lose them in the process.*
* **A (81): 15%**
* **B (12): 40%** (Misconception: $k \times 4$)
* **C (-81): 10%**
* **D (-12): 35%** (Misconception: $-3 \times 4$)

**Basic (Working towards expectations)**
*These students know that $3^4$ is $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$. However, they almost universally believe that if you plug a negative number into a formula, the result "stays" negative.*
* **A (81): 25%**
* **B (12): 10%**
* **C (-81): 60%** (The dominant misconception: $(-3)^4 = -81$)
* **D (-12): 5%**

**Proficient (Meeting expectations)**
*These students are careful with substitution. They will likely write down $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$ and "pair up" the negatives. However, many will still be tripped up if they are relying on their calculator memory without using brackets.*
* **A (81): 65%**
* **B (12): 0%**
* **C (-81): 35%** (Even strong students fall for the "a negative squared is positive, but a power of 4 feels negative" trap or simple sign-errors.)
* **D (-12): 0%**

**Advanced (Exceeding expectations)**
*These students have mastered index laws and the nuances of negative bases. They recognize that any even power of a real number must be non-negative.*
* **A (81): 95%**
* **B (12): 0%**
* **C (-81): 5%** (Usually due to a "silly mistake" or over-speeding.)
* **D (-12): 0%**

### Teacher's Note:
The "Confidence Factor" here is very high for Answer C. If you ask a Year 9 student why they chose -81, they will often confidently state: "Because 3 to the power of 4 is 81, and it's a minus 3, so it's minus 81." They apply the negative sign at the very end as a "flavoring" rather than a part of the base being multiplied.
