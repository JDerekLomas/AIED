This is a classic "subject-specialist" question. While the underlying operation (changing the subject of a formula) is standard, the multi-step nature involving a fraction, $\pi$, and a cube root makes it a high-cognitive-load task for Year 9.

### DIFFICULTY: 8/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this is an 8. It sits just below completing the square because while the steps are logical, it tests three distinct areas of weakness simultaneously: algebraic manipulation of fractions, understanding that $\pi$ is a coefficient rather than a variable, and the inverse operation of a cube.

### PREDICTED RESPONSE DISTRIBUTIONS

I have categorized the cohorts based on typical UK progress stages (Working Towards, Expected, Exceeding).

**below_basic (Working Towards / Low Tier)**
*Misconception:* These students usually try to match symbols rather than rearrange. They often think $\frac{4}{3}$ must remain $\frac{4}{3}$ in the answer. Option A is a "confident wrong" choice because it keeps the original fraction intact.
**A=45% B=20% C=15% D=20%**

**basic (Expected / Foundation-Higher crossover)**
*Misconception:* They know they need to "move" the 3, but often stumble on whether to multiply or divide. They recognize that $r^3$ requires a cube root, which rules out D, but they often leave $\pi$ in the numerator by accident or follow the visual pattern of the sphere formula too closely.
**A=25% B=30% C=35% D=10%**

**proficient (Exceeding / Higher Tier)**
*Process:* These students can successfully perform the two-step rearrangement ($3V = 4\pi r^3$, then $r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$). The primary trap here is the visual similarity between B and C. If they rush, they may invert the fraction incorrectly.
**A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%**

**advanced (High Achieving / Level 8-9)**
*Process:* These students handle the literal equations with ease and recognize that $\pi$ stays with the 4 in the denominator.
**A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%**

### Teacher's Note: The "Why"
*   **The Trap (Option A):** Students who lack algebraic confidence see the $\frac{4}{3}$ and $\pi$ in the original formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) and assume they must appear the same way in the answer.
*   **The Calculation Error (Option B):** This represents a student who knows the 3 moves to the top, but forgets that $\pi$ is multiplied by the 4 and thus must be divided along with it.
*   **The Distractor (Option D):** This tests for a radical misunderstanding of the cube root's scope, pulling the fraction out of the radical entirely.
