As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in Year 9 assessments (AQA/Edexcel Foundation Tier style). 

While "expanding brackets" is a standard procedural skill, this question isolates a specific sub-skill: **integer multiplication combined with algebraic sign rules.** It is a classic "trap" question designed to catch students who focus on the digits rather than the operations.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
For a typical Year 9 student, the calculation is basic, but the "confidence in error" is high. It ranks a 4 because while the maths is "easy," the misconception rate remains stubbornly high even among middle-ability sets.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic:** *Students at this level often confuse the operations (multiplication vs. addition) and struggle with negative numbers. They see "1" and "4" and perform an addition because they aren't fully fluent in the "FOIL" or Grid method context.*
*   **A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%** (Significant lean towards -5 because they see $-1$ and $-4$ and simply "combine" them via addition).

**Basic:** *These students know they should be multiplying because they recognise the context of expanding brackets. However, they almost always miss the "double negative" rule, leading to a "confident wrong" answer.*
*   **A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%** (Heavy bias toward -4. They know $1 \times 4 = 4$, but think "a negative stays negative").

**Proficient:** *These students have a solid grasp of the four operations and the rules of directed numbers. They recognize that multiplying two negatives produces a positive.*
*   **A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%** (Majority correct, with a few "silly" sign errors remaining).

**Advanced:** *Students at this level should find this trivial and see through the distractor immediately.*
*   **A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%** (Almost perfect accuracy, with rare slips).

### Teacher's Insight: The "Confident Wrong" Factor
This is a high **misconception activation** question. 
1.  **The Operation Trap:** Many lower-ability students see two numbers inside brackets and intuitively add them (leading to **D**).
2.  **The Sign Trap:** The most common mistake for the "Basic" cohort is choosing **B**. In their heads, they reason: *"1 times 4 is 4, and there are minus signs there, so the answer is minus 4."* They haven't yet internalized that the signs are operators attached to the terms, not just aesthetic labels.
