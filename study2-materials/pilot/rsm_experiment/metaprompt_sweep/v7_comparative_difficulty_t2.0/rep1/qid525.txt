This is a classic "trap" question for a Year 9 group. While the arithmetic is theoretically covered in Key Stage 2 (Year 6), the retention of the specific algorithm—and the discipline to convert back to the requested form—remains a sticking point for many.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10

**Teacher’s Perspective:**
This sits squarely in the "confidently wrong" category for many. Students often remember fragments of rules. The "Low Stakes" mistake is simply adding the numerators and denominators (Option D). The "Medium Stakes" mistake is performing the calculation correctly but ignoring the instruction to leave it as a mixed number (Option A).

The primary challenge here isn't the concept of addition; it’s the **procedural stamina** required to find a common denominator (20) and the **reading comprehension** to provide the correct final format.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic:**
*Likely to apply "addition across" (2+2=4, 7+1=8, 10+4=14) or simply pick a number that looks like a fraction they’d expect.*
* **A=15% | B=20% | C=15% | D=50%**

**Basic:**
*Understand that a common denominator is needed but often choose the easiest one (40) rather than the lowest (20). Many will calculate it as an improper fraction ($\frac{99}{20}$) but forget to convert it back, or get caught out by Option D if rushing.*
* **A=40% | B=30% | C=10% | D=20%**

**Proficient:**
*Solid understanding of fractions. They will likely find the common denominator of 20 and calculate $\frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$. They are more likely to notice the "Mixed Number" instruction but might still slip into selecting A because it represents their raw result.*
* **A=15% | B=75% | C=5% | D=5%**

**Advanced:**
*Will see the "Mixed Number" instruction immediately. Will likely work with whole numbers and fractions separately ($4 + \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20}$) or quickly convert and revert without error.*
* **A=2% | B=96% | C=1% | D=1%**

### Distractor Analysis:
*   **A ($ \frac{99}{20} $):** The "Process over Product" trap. Correct numerical value, but violates the "mixed number" constraint.
*   **B ($ 4 \frac{19}{20} $):** The Correct Answer.
*   **C ($ \frac{99}{40} $):** The "Common Denominator via Multiplication" error, where the student multiplies denominators but forgets to adjust numerators or makes an error in the conversion.
*   **D ($ 4 \frac{8}{14} $):** The "Add across" misconception (7+1 over 10+4). This is the most common intuitive error for lower-attaining students.
