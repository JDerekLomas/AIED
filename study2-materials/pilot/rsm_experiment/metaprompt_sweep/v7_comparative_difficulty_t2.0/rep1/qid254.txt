As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it doesn't test the ability to add; it tests **conceptual precision** and **order of operations (BIDMAS)**.

While calculating a mean is usually a "Difficulty 3" task, this specific question is a "trap" question designed to expose two specific pedagogical hurdles: the role of zero in data sets and the standard notation of the arithmetic mean.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
For a Year 9 student, the arithmetic is trivial, but the logical pitfalls make it harder than a standard "find the mean" task. This is a classic "confident mistake" question.

### The Misconceptions
*   **Zero Exclusion (Option C):** Students often subconsciously believe zero "doesn't count." They conflate "the value is nothing" with "the data point doesn't exist."
*   **Order of Operations (Option B):** In the UK curriculum, students are taught BIDMAS. Option B, if typed exactly into a basic calculator or written as a linear string, only divides the 7 by 5, not the sum. 
*   **The "Invisible" Zero (Option A):** This is the correct mathematical process ($\frac{\Sigma x}{n}$), even though the 0 isn't explicitly written in the numerator (as $0+x=x$).

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic:**
*Targeting students struggling with the definition of 'Mean' or basic notation.*
*   **A=15% | B=20% | C=55% | D=10%**
*   *Rationale:* A huge proportion will choose **C** because they believe the divisor must match the "active" numbers. Some will choose **B** because it "looks" like the right steps in a line.

**Basic:**
*Targeting students who know how to calculate mean but are prone to "the zero trap".*
*   **A=40% | B=10% | C=45% | D=5%**
*   *Rationale:* This group is split. Half will recognize there are five numbers ($n=5$), but many will still be seduced by **C**, thinking they shouldn't count the zero in the denominator.

**Proficient:**
*Targeting students comfortable with data and basic BIDMAS.*
*   **A=75% | B=5% | C=15% | D=5%**
*   *Rationale:* Most will correctly identify **A** because $1+3+4+7$ is the same as $0+1+3+4+7$, and the division by 5 is correct. They avoid **B** because they recognise it lacks necessary brackets.

**Advanced:**
*Targeting students with high attention to detail.*
*   **A=90% | B=2% | C=3% | D=5%**
*   *Rationale:* Almost all will see through the zero trick. A small handful might overthink the lack of the "0+" in the numerator of **A** and mistakenly pivot to **D**, but the majority will identify **A** as the only algebraically sound representation.

**Teacher's Note:** If you are using this in a Year 9 lesson, expect a heated argument between the "Option A" and "Option C" camps. It is a fantastic starter for a discussion on why we include zero values (e.g., goals scored in a football match).
