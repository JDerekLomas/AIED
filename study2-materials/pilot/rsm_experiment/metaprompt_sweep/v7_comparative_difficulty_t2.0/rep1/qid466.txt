As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It’s a "wolf in sheep’s clothing" because it targets a very specific cognitive load issue: the interaction between **reciprocals** and **negative number rules**.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this sits at a 6. While the arithmetic is simple, it is a high-misconception question. Students "know" that to get 1, you flip the fraction (reciprocal), but their "negative number alarm" often rings too loudly or not loudly enough. They are highly likely to confidently choose the wrong answer.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic** (Working towards KS3 targets, likely struggles with fractions):
*   **Prediction:** They will likely ignore the negative sign entirely and look for a "matching" fraction or get confused by the 1. Many will pick C because they see the "3" and "4" and ignore the reciprocal logic.
*   **A=15% B=20% C=45% D=20%**

**Basic** (Securing KS3 content, understands basic fraction multiplication):
*   **Prediction:** High misconception activation here. They know that a number times its reciprocal is 1. They see the negative sign in the question and assume the answer must be negative (Option B) because they are misapplying the "adding negatives" logic or over-correcting.
*   **A=30% B=45% C=15% D=10%**

**Proficient** (GCSE Foundation/Higher crossover, comfortable with directed numbers):
*   **Prediction:** This group performs best but still trips up. They will recognise that $(-) \times (+) = (-)$. They will consciously check the signs. However, under time pressure, a significant minority will still pick B because "it looks more complete."
*   **A=65% B=25% C=5% D=5%**

**Advanced** (Top set Year 9, target Grade 8/9):
*   **Prediction:** Most will see this as an identity question ($\text{number} \times \text{reciprocal} = 1$). They will instantly spot that to keep the product negative, the star must be positive.
*   **A=90% B=8% C=1% D=1%**

### Teacher's Analysis of the Errors:
*   **The "Reciprocal Trap" (B):** This is the most common "confidently wrong" answer. Students remember that reciprocals are for "getting to 1," and they see the minus sign at the start, so they reflexively put a minus sign in the star. They forget that $(-1) \times (-1) = +1$.
*   **The "Identity Confusion" (C/D):** These students are guessing or thinking about addition (where you'd need the additive inverse to get to zero).
*   **The "Correct Logic" (A):** Requires two distinct steps of thought: 1) What fraction flips it to 1? and 2) What sign keeps the product negative? Most mistakes happen because students only perform step 1 and then "guess" the sign based on visual symmetry.
