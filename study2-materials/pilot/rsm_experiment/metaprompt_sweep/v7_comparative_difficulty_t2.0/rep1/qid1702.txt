As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It appears simple, but it targets a specific "cognitive trap" regarding the order of substitution and basic arithmetic with decimals.

### **DIFFICULTY: 6/10**

For a typical Year 9 class, this sits just above the midpoint. While the algebra is "Level 5/6" (Old National Curriculum), the friction comes from the decimal $0.5$ and the requirement to rearrange the equation or solve for $x$ rather than the usual $y$.

**The "High Misconception" Factor:**
This is a classic "confident mistake" question. Many students will subconsciously swap the $x$ and $y$ values or struggle with the signs when moving terms across the equals sign.

### **PREDICTED RESPONSE DISTRIBUTIONS**

#### **Below Basic (Students working at KS3 Grade 1-2)**
*These students struggle with the concept of substitution. They often look for patterns in the numbers or guess based on the "look" of the equation.*
*   **A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%**
*   **Rationale:** Choice **C** is the "Distractor King." Many students will see $10x$, ignore the $y$ term, and try to divide $30/10$ and somehow adjust for the $6$. Or they simply guess $3.3$ because $30/10 = 3$.

#### **Basic (Students working at KS3 Grade 3 / GCSE Grade 3)**
*These students know to substitute, but often substitute into the wrong variable or make sign errors.*
*   **A=15% B=40% C=30% D=15%**
*   **Rationale:** This group often makes the mistake: $10x = 30 - 3$. They see $-6(0.5) = -3$ and "move it over" as $-3$ instead of $+3$. This leads to $10x = 27 \rightarrow 2.7$, or they mess up the negative entirely. **B** is a common "calculator error" or logic flip.

#### **Proficient (Students working at KS3 Grade 4-5 / GCSE Grade 4-5)**
*These students follow the process correctly: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30$.*
*   **A=75% B=10% C=5% D=10%**
*   **Rationale:** Most will successfully reach $10x = 33$. A small portion will still stumble at the final step ($33/10$) or perform the subtraction $30-3$ (Option D).

#### **Advanced (Students working at KS3 Grade 6+ / GCSE Grade 6-9)**
*These students are fluent in rearranging and substitution.*
*   **A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%**
*   **Rationale:** The only errors here are likely "silly" slips—reading the $y$ as the $x$ or a momentary lapse in mental arithmetic.

### **Teacher’s Breakdown of the Distractors:**
*   **A (3.3): The Correct Answer.** ($10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$).
*   **B (-4.25) & D (2.7):** Created by sign errors. If a student does $30 - 3 = 27$, they get **D**. If they substitute $x=0.5$ instead of $y=0.5$ (swapping variables), they get $5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y = -4.16$ (roughly **B**).
*   **C (3.3 / 4.25 confusion):** Often students arrive at 3.3 but second-guess if the question is "trickier" than it looks, or they misread $10x - 6(0.5)$ as something requiring the addition of 10.
