This is a classic "trap" question. To a seasoned teacher, this screams **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)** combined with **directed number (integers)**. 

While the individual components are taught early, putting them together in Year 9 creates a high "misconception activation." Many students follow BIDMAS like a rigid set of instructions (doing addition before subtraction) rather than treating addition and subtraction as equal priority from left-to-right.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10
For Year 9, this is technically a Grade 2/3 GCSE skill, but it is a "confident mistake" question. It’s not mathematically complex, but it is psychologically deceptive.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to options:**
*   **A (6): Correct.** $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = 6$.
*   **B (4): Misconception (Rigid BIDMAS).** $4 \times 2 = 8$. Then student sees "Addition then Subtraction" and does $5 + 8 = 13$, then $3 - 13 = -10$. (Wait, -10 is D. Students who do $3-5=-2$, then $-2+8$ but make a sign error might hit 4).
*   **C (-12): Misconception (Left to Right).** Ignores BIDMAS. $3-5 = -2$. Then $-2 + 4 = 2$. Then $2 \times 2 = 4$. Or, $3-5+4 = 2 \times 2$. (Less likely but common in very low sets).
*   **D (-10): High Misconception (The "Addition First" Trap).** $4 \times 2 = 8$. Student then adds 5 and 8 to get 13. Finally $3 - 13 = -10$. This is the most common error for students who "know" BIDMAS but don't understand it fully.

#### **below_basic (Working at Grade 1-2)**
*These students often ignore priority of operations or struggle with negative numbers.*
**A=15% B=15% C=30% D=40%**
*Commentary:* High attraction to Option D. A large chunk will also simply work left-to-right (leading toward C/B-range).

#### **basic (Working at Grade 3)**
*These students remember the BIDMAS acronym but treat 'A' as strictly before 'S'.*
**A=30% B=10% C=10% D=50%**
*Commentary:* This group is most likely to get it "confidently wrong." They believe they are being clever by doing the addition $(5+8)$ before the subtraction.

#### **proficient (Working at Grade 4-5)**
*These students are beginning to understand left-to-right priority and integer arithmetic.*
**A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%**
*Commentary:* Most will get it right, but a significant minority will still fall into the $3-13$ trap if they are working too quickly.

#### **advanced (Working at Grade 6+)**
*These students see the terms as $+3, -5, +8$.*
**A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%**
*Commentary:* Almost total mastery, though a rare "slip of the pen" can occur.
