As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it moves away from procedural "solving" and into the realm of **mathematical reasoning** and **order of operations**.

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this is significantly harder than simply solving the equation. While the equation itself is a "Level 5" task, the diagnostic nature of the question forces students to evaluate different balancing methods. 

*   **Tom** represents the standard "add 5 to both sides" approach. 
*   **Katie** represents a common mistake where students multiply by the denominator but forget to multiply **every term** by that number.

This is a classic "confident misconception" question. Most students will instinctively choose Tom and dismiss Katie, or (if they are wary) assume there must be a "trick" and choose both.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to groupings:**
*   **Below Basic:** Working below GCSE Grade 2 (struggles with basic operations).
*   **Basic:** Target Grade 3-4 (can solve one-step and some two-step equations).
*   **Proficient:** Target Grade 5-6 (confident with inverse operations and fractions).
*   **Advanced:** Target Grade 7-9 (fluid with algebraic manipulation and spotting errors).

| Group | A (Only Tom) | B (Only Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 40% | 15% | 35% | 10% |
| **Basic** | 75% | 5% | 15% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 2% | 10% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 92% | 1% | 5% | 2% |

### Analysis of Choices:

*   **A (Only Tom) - The Correct Answer:** This requires identifying that Tom has correctly balanced the equation by adding 5 to both sides. Most proficient students will spot this and correctly identify that Katie’s "multiplying by 3" neglected the `-5` term.
*   **C (Both) - The High-Confidence Misconception:** This is the "distractor" for middle-attaining students. Students often learn the rule "if there's a divide-by-3, you multiply by 3" but apply it locally to the fraction only, rather than the entire side of the equation. Katie’s line looks "mathsy" enough to be a valid alternative step to a student who hasn't fully mastered the distributive property of multiplication over an entire side of an equation.
*   **B (Only Katie):** Rare. This occurs usually in students who have a fixed rule in their head that "you must clear the fraction first" and believe Tom’s way is "illegal" or messy.
*   **D (Neither):** Usually a blind guess or a result of arithmetic errors (e.g., thinking $12 + 5$ is not $17$).

### Teacher’s Insight:
The "Basic" and "Proficient" groups actually have the highest percentage for **A**, but not necessarily because they understand why Katie is wrong. It is because Tom’s way is the *only* way they were taught. The "Advanced" students are the only ones who can articulate that for Katie to be correct, her line would have to be $x - 15 = 36$.
