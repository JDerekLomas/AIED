This is a classic "bread and butter" question for Key Stage 3 algebra, but it is heavily laden with "negative number traps." In a Year 9 context, this measures operational fluency with signs more than the conceptual understanding of the FOIL/Grid method itself.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the method is standard, the requirement to process three separate negative number operations ($–5 + –7$ and $–5 \times –7$) pushes this from a simple 4/10 (where signs are positive) to a 6/10. It is a "high misconception" question where students are often confident but incorrect.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic:** 
*Focus: Usually forget the "middle term" or lose track of signs entirely. Often pick A because they simply find the difference between 5 and 7, or D because they think "negative times negative must be negative."*
**A=40% B=15% C=15% D=30%**

**Basic:** 
*Focus: They know the FOIL/Grid method and know there should be a middle term, but they struggle with directed number rules. They will likely get the 12 but miss the $+35$.*
**A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%**

**Proficient:**
*Focus: Strong understanding of the distributive law. Most errors here are "slips" (calculation errors) rather than "flops" (conceptual errors). B is the dominant choice.*
**A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%**

**Advanced:**
*Focus: Mastery of the topic. Any errors are rare and usually down to extreme haste.*
**A=1% B=98% C=1% D=0%**

### Teacher’s Analysis of Misconceptions:
*   **The "Addition vs Multiplication" Trap (Option A):** This is for students who don't fully distribute the brackets. They might do $m \times m$ and then $5 - 7$ or $7 - 5$, ending up with $-2m$. 
*   **The Sign Swap (Option C):** This student knows $5 + 7 = 12$ and knows $-5 \times -7$ is positive, but they ignore the negative signs on the $m$ terms entirely, essentially treating the problem as $(m+5)(m+7)$.
*   **The "Double Negative" Logic Error (Option D):** This is the most common "confidently wrong" answer for intermediate students. They correctly calculate $-5 + -7 = -12$, but their brain misfires on the last step, thinking "The question has minuses in it, so the answer should have minuses in it," resulting in $-35$.
