As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. On the surface, it’s a one-step linear equation. However, because it involves a unit fraction, it acts as a "wolf in sheep's clothing."

In a Year 9 context, this is a classic **"Confidence Trap."** Many students will not feel the need to write down their working (multiplying by 1/3 or dividing by 3) and will instead rely on mental number bonds or "intuitive" arithmetic.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the mechanics are simple, the **misconception activation** is extremely high. In a Year 9 classroom, this is significantly harder than $3p = 12$. The fraction creates a cognitive load that pushes students toward "pretty" numbers rather than correct algebraic processes.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Key to Distractors:**
*   **A ($p = 1/4$):** The "Visual Shortcut." Students see 3 and 12 and immediately think $12 \div 3$. They keep it as a fraction because the question has a fraction.
*   **B (Correct):** Students recognize that to isolate $p$, they must divide by 3 (or multiply by 1/3), resulting in $\frac{1}{12 \times 3}$.
*   **C ($p = 4$):** The "Reciprocal Error." Similar to A, but the student ignores the fraction structure entirely or thinks they need to "flip" the fraction to solve it.
*   **D ($p = 1/9$):** The "Squaring/Tripling confusion." Students sometimes confuse the coefficient 3 with the relationship between 3 and 12, or perform $3 \times 3$ incorrectly. (Less common).

| Group | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 45% | 10% | 40% | 5% |
| **Basic** | 55% | 20% | 20% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 30% | 55% | 10% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | 92% | 2% | 1% |

### Teacher’s Analysis:

1.  **The "Below Basic" group** will largely guess based on the numbers they see. Since 3 goes into 12 four times, they will gravitate toward **A** and **C** in almost equal measure, depending on whether they think the answer "looks" like a fraction.
2.  **The "Basic" group** is actually *more* likely to get this wrong than the group below them because they have just enough knowledge to be dangerous. They know they need to "divide by 3," but they will perform $12 \div 3$ instead of $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$, leading them firmly to **Option A**. This is where the highest "Confident Wrong" percentage sits.
3.  **The "Proficient" group** usually survives this by writing down the step: $p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 \rightarrow \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$. However, even here, a significant minority will rush and pick A.
4.  **The "Advanced" group** recognizes this as a standard manipulation and is unlikely to be tripped up, unless through pure overconfidence/carelessness.
