As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it perfectly captures the intersection of **substitution**, **powers**, and **directed numbers**—a "triple threat" for a Year 9 student.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the operation is simple (it's not long division or complex algebra), it scores a 6 because it is a **high-misconception** task. Even students who understand indices often trip over the negative sign. In a UK classroom, this is a classic "Grade 4" GCSE-style foundation/higher crossover question.

### Analysis of the "Confidence in Error"
This is not a "random guess" question. Students will be very confident in their wrong answers. 
*   **The Sign Trap:** Many believe that if the input is negative, the output must be negative. 
*   **The Operation Trap:** Weaker students see a small 4 and a big 3 and multiply them.
*   **The Calculator Trap:** If they use a non-CAS calculator and type $-3^4$, it will give $-81$ (due to BIDMAS), reinforcing the misconception.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working at KS3 Stage 3/4)**
*Focus: Struggles with the concept of powers and negative integers.*
*   **A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%**
*   *Logic:* These students often revert to multiplication. They see $3$ and $4$ and think $12$. They are more likely to pick $-12$ because the input was $-3$.

**Basic (Working at Grade 3 GCSE)**
*Focus: Understands powers but fails on the "Negative $\times$ Negative" rule.*
*   **A=20% B=5% C=70% D=5%**
*   *Logic:* They know $3^4 = 81$, but they firmly believe that a negative number raised to *any* power stays negative. Option C is the ultimate "distractor" here.

**Proficient (Working at Grade 5/6 GCSE)**
*Focus: Understands indices and basic negative rules, but prone to "Silly Mistakes".*
*   **A=65% B=0% C=35% D=0%**
*   *Logic:* Most will correctly pair the negatives ($(-3) \times (-3) = 9$; $9 \times 9 = 81$), but a significant minority will overthink it or fall into the "calculator notation" trap.

**Advanced (Working at Grade 7-9 GCSE)**
*Focus: Fluency in algebraic manipulation and number properties.*
*   **A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%**
*   *Logic:* These students recognise that an even exponent always results in a positive real value. They are unlikely to be caught out unless they are working far too quickly.
