As a UK maths teacher, I have seen this specific structure of equation trip up students countless times. 

While it looks "easier" than completing the square, the cognitive load is surprisingly high because the variable is in the denominator. This is a classic **"high misconception"** question. Many students don't guess randomly; they confidently apply an operation that feels "maths-y" but is algebraically incorrect.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a Year 9 class, this sits just above the midpoint. Most can solve $2p = 10$ or $p/5 = 10$ easily, but the "unknown on the bottom" forces a two-step rearrangement (or a mental reciprocation) that many haven't mastered.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic** (Working towards KS3 expectations)
*   **A: 20% | B: 60% | C: 15% | D: 5%**
*   *Reasoning:* These students see the numbers 10 and 5 and immediately want to multiply them. The "50" feels like a "big" enough answer to be right. They lack the conceptual understanding that $p$ must be small to result in a larger whole number.

**Basic** (Securing KS3 / Foundation GCSE target)
*   **A: 40% | B: 30% | C: 25% | D: 5%**
*   *Reasoning:* This group often identifies that multiplication is wrong, but they perform the division in the order they see it (10 divided by 5), leading them to $p = 2$. However, "A" becomes the strongest "confident mistake" here because they know the answer should be $1/2$ but might struggle with decimal conversions or "feel" like $0.5$ is more sophisticated.

**Proficient** (Aiming for GCSE Grade 5/6)
*   **A: 70% | B: 5% | C: 20% | D: 5%**
*   *Reasoning:* Most students at this level understand that $10p = 5$, therefore $p = 5/10$. The primary error here is the "Commutative Division" trap—students accidentally doing $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$ under exam pressure.

**Advanced** (Top set Year 9 / Higher GCSE)
*   **A: 95% | B: 0% | C: 5% | D: 0%**
*   *Reasoning:* These students either instantly recognise the inverse relationship or fluently rearrange. The only errors here are "silly slips" where a student moves too fast and selects C ($10 \div 5$).

### Teacher's Note on Misconceptions:
The **"C" (p=2)** response is the most dangerous attractor. Students are habituated to "Large Number ÷ Small Number." When they see $10$ and $5$, their brain short-circuits to $10 \div 5 = 2$ without checking if $5 \div 2$ actually equals $10$. This is why I rate it a 6—it tests logic and checking-back skills more than just memorised procedures.
