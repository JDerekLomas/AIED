This is a classic "subject-manipulation" question that bridges the gap between Geometry and Algebra. For a typical Year 9 student, this is significantly more difficult than it looks, primarily because it requires multiple steps of algebraic inversion involving fractions and a non-standard root.

### DIFFICULTY: 8/10
While Year 9s are taught the volume of a sphere formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, they rarely practice rearranging it to make $r$ the subject. Most Year 9 practice involves substituting values *into* the formula. Converting a "word formula" into an abstract algebraic manipulation is a High Level 6/Low Level 7 skill in the UK curriculum.

### Predicted Response Distributions

| Group | A (%) | B (%) | C (%) | D (%) | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 35% | 30% | 15% | 20% | They often choose A or B because they see $4$ and $\pi$ together and assume the $3$ stays at the bottom. This group is essentially guessing based on visual patterns. |
| **Basic** | 40% | 25% | 20% | 15% | **A** is the strongest "confidently wrong" distractor. Students think they need to multiply the existing terms of the formula, failing to realize the reciprocal nature of moving a fraction to the other side. |
| **Proficient** | 20% | 15% | 55% | 10% | These students know they need to "undo" the $\frac{4}{3}$, resulting in $\frac{3}{4}$. They might briefly look at D but realize the cube root must cover the entire expression. |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 3% | 93% | 2% | Advanced students will work this out on paper or mentally isolate $r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$. They are unlikely to be tripped up by the distractors unless they make a very hasty reading error. |

### Teacher’s Insight:
*   **The "Confidently Wrong" factor:** This is high for option **A**. Many students internalize the sphere formula as "four-thirds-pi-r-cubed." When asked to reverse it, their intuition often tells them to keep the "four-thirds" intact as a single block, leading them to simply "tack on" the V.
*   **Notation Barriers:** For Year 9s, the $\sqrt[3]{\dots}$ notation extending over a fraction is visually intimidating. Weak students may opt for **D** because it looks "tidier" or resembles linear equations they are more comfortable with.
*   **Common Pitfall:** The most frequent error is multiplying by 4 and dividing by 3 (retaining the fraction's original orientation), rather than multiplying by 3 and dividing by 4.
