As an experienced UK maths teacher, this is a fantastic "diagnostic" style question. It specifically targets the **priority of operations** when rearranging equations, a major sticking point in Key Stage 3.

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 student, this is more challenging than it looks. While "Solving for $x$" might be a 4/10, evaluating the *validity* of multiple methods (especially when one contains a very common misconception) requires a higher level of fluency. 

### Teacher's Analysis
The core of this question lies in **Katie's mistake**.
*   **Tom** follows the "Reverse BIDMAS" logic (balancing the -5 first). This is correct.
*   **Katie** attempts to multiply by 3 before dealing with the constant. For her line to be correct, she must multiply *every* term by 3, resulting in $x - 15 = 36$. However, a vast number of students believe you can simply multiply the fraction and the answer, "leaving the -5 for later."

This is a high **misconception-activation** question. Many students will confidently choose "Both" because Katie's $x$ and $36$ look "right" to the untrained eye.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working at Grade 1-2):**
These students often struggle with the basic mechanics of inverse operations. Many will see the 3 and the 12 and think "12 times 3 is 36" and choose Katie, or guess randomly.
*   **A: 20% | B: 30% | C: 35% | D: 15%**

**Basic (Working at Grade 3-4):**
These students have learned the "flow" of two-step equations. They likely know Tom is right, but they often fall for the "illusion of validity" in Katie’s working because they frequently make the same mistake in their own books (forgetting to multiply the constant).
*   **A: 40% | B: 15% | C: 40% | D: 5%**

**Proficient (Working at Grade 5-6):**
The majority of these students understand the "balancing" method. They will recognize Tom’s move as the standard way to solve. However, about 20% will still be lured by "Both" because they haven't yet mastered the distributive property applied to an entire equation.
*   **A: 70% | B: 5% | C: 20% | D: 5%**

**Advanced (Working at Grade 7+):**
These students can spot the flaw in Katie's logic immediately (the "missing -15"). They are unlikely to be fooled and will see Tom's move as a standard first step.
*   **A: 95% | B: 0% | C: 3% | D: 2%**

### Final Summary for a typical mixed-ability Year 9:
**DIFFICULTY: 6/10**

*   **below_basic:** A=20% B=30% C=35% D=15%
*   **basic:** A=40% B=15% C=40% D=5%
*   **proficient:** A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
*   **advanced:** A=95% B=0% C=3% D=2%
