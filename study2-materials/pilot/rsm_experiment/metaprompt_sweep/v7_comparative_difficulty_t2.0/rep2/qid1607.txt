This is a classic "lure" question that tests structural understanding of algebraic operations. For a Year 9 student, this falls into the category of a question where they **confidently get it wrong** because they perform the correct *type* of operation but in the wrong *direction*.

### **DIFFICULTY: 4/10**

While the arithmetic is simple, the psychological trap in Step 2 is very high for students who rely on "rules of thumb" (like "move it to the other side and change the sign") rather than balancing the equation.

*   **Step 1:** Almost everyone recognizes that they need to multiply by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$).
*   **Step 2:** The misconception is triggered here. A student sees $60 = 1 + k$. They know they need to "do something with the 1." Instead of subtracting 1 from 60, they incorrectly apply the "inverse" logic by thinking "I need to add 1 to the 60," resulting in 61.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Key for Categories:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students working significantly below age-related expectations (struggling with basic 1-step equations).
*   **Basic:** Students who know the "rules" of algebra but apply them inconsistently.
*   **Proficient:** Students at age-related expectations (Level 5/6 in old money; Grade 4/5 GCSE).
*   **Advanced:** Top-set students (Grade 7-9 GCSE).

| Category | A (Step 1 Only) | B (Step 2 Only) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 10% | **65%** | 10% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 5% | **60%** | 10% |
| **Proficient** | **55%** | 5% | 35% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | **92%** | 1% | 5% | 2% |

### **Analysis of the Distribution:**
*   **The Trap (Option C):** This is the most popular answer for **Below Basic** and **Basic** students. They see $15 \times 4 = 60$ and feel successful. They then see $+1$ and $+k$ and $61$, and their brain registers "60 plus 1 is 61," overlooking the fact that they should be isolating $k$ by subtracting.
*   **The Mastery (Option A):** As we move to **Proficient** and **Advanced**, students have the "check" mechanism. They see Step 1 is correct but pause at Step 2, realizing $60 - 1 = 59$.
*   **The Anomalies (B and D):** These will be very low across all sets. Step 1 is mathematically intuitive enough ($15 \times 4$) that very few students will claim Step 1 is "wrong" while claiming Step 2 is "right."
