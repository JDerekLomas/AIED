As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific problem as a "classic" diagnostic question. It probes whether a student understands that a common denominator requires a **multiplicative** relationship rather than an **additive** one, and whether they can handle the algebraic variable correctly.

For a Year 9 class (13-14 year olds), this sits squarely in the middle of the "Algebraic Fractions" topic, which is often introduced toward the end of Key Stage 3 for higher-ability sets.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the arithmetic is simple, the "distractor" logic is very strong here. Many Year 9 students can solve linear equations or expand brackets confidently but revert to incorrect "intuitive" rules when faced with algebraic fractions.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Rationale for the distractors:**
*   **A (Correct):** Student identifies common denominator $2x$ and correctly doubles the numerator of the second fraction $(8/2x)$.
*   **B (Misconception):** "Add across the top, add across the bottom." Extremely common for lower-attaining students who treat numerators and denominators as independent integers ($3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$).
*   **C (Calculation Error):** Student finds the correct numerator ($3+8=11$) but forgets the denominator is $2x$, or incorrectly simplifies $11/2x$ to $11/x$.
*   **D (Denominator Ignored):** Student correctly identifies the common denominator $2x$ but fails to scale the numerator of the second fraction, simply adding $3+4$.

| Group | A (Correct) | B (Distractor) | C (Error) | D (Common) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | **65%** | 5% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 35% | 30% | 10% | **25%** |
| **Proficient** | **70%** | 10% | 5% | 15% |
| **Advanced** | **95%** | 2% | 1% | 2% |

### Teacher’s Notes:
*   **The "Confidentially Wrong" factor:** This is high. Students choosing **B** will rarely guess; they will calculate it rapidly and feel certain because $3+4=7$ and $2+1=3$.
*   **The "Hidden 1" Problem:** Many Year 9s see $x$ and $2x$ and don't immediately recognise that they only need to multiply the second fraction by 2. They may attempt to cross-multiply to get a denominator of $2x^2$, leading them into a mess of simplification they aren't prepared for.
*   **Year 9 Context:** If this is a "Foundation" tier Year 9 class, the difficulty jumps to an **8/10**. If it is a "Higher" tier set, it is a **4/10** check-challenge.
