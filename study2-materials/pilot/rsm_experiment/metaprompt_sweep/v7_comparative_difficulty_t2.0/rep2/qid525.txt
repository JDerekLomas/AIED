This is a classic "trap" question for a Year 9 group. While the arithmetic is theoretically Key Stage 2/Early Key Stage 3 level, the format of the options intentionally targets specific cognitive biases and procedural misconceptions.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10

In a typical UK Year 9 classroom, this is a mid-tier difficulty. It isn't complex, but it requires "finiteness"—the ability to complete every step of a multi-stage process without reverting to a shortcut.

**The primary misconceptions being tested here:**
*   **The "Add Across" Trap:** Students adding denominators $(10+4=14)$ and numerators $(7+1=8)$.
*   **The Improper vs. Mixed Number confusion:** Students who do the math correctly but fail to convert back to the required format (or see the equivalent value and stop).
*   **The Common Denominator error:** Multiplying the denominators $(10 \times 4 = 40)$ but forgetting to adjust the numerators accordingly.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Students working at KS2 level/lower sets):**
High "confidence in error." These students will almost instinctively add across the numerators and denominators. They will see Option D, notice the $4$ $(2+2)$ and the $8/14$ $(7+1$ and $10+4)$, and select it without hesitation.
*   **A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%**

**Basic (Working at grade/targeting Grade 3-4):**
These students know they need a common denominator, but often choose $40$ over the lowest common multiple of $20$. They are prone to getting the numerator $99$ (converting to improper) but failing to convert back to a mixed number as requested, leading them to A.
*   **A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%**

**Proficient (Secure Grade 5-6):**
These students have mastered the algorithm. They will likely convert to $4 \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$. A few might lose a mark by giving the improper fraction (A), but most will read the prompt for a mixed number.
*   **A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%**

**Advanced (Grade 7-9):**
These students will solve this mentally. They will automatically dismiss D and C, calculate the decimal equivalent ($2.7 + 2.25 = 4.95$) or use common denominators to reach B instantly.
*   **A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%**

### Analysis of the Options:
*   **A ($\frac{99}{20}$):** The correct value, but the wrong *format*. It catches the "halfway-correct" student.
*   **B ($4 \frac{19}{20}$):** The correct answer.
*   **C ($\frac{99}{40}$):** Result of multiplying denominators but failing to adjust numerators (or a partial conversion error).
*   **D ($4 \frac{8}{14}$):** The "Universal Misconception"—adding integers, then adding numerators and denominators directly.
