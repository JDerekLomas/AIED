As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it highlights the "traps" of BIDMAS (Order of Operations) that even Key Stage 3 students frequently fall into.

### **Difficulty Rating: 4/10**
While the arithmetic itself is trivial (Difficulty 1), the conceptual misunderstanding surrounding the "addition vs. subtraction" hierarchy is a classic Year 9 pitfall. Students are often taught BIDMAS/BODMAS as a rigid linear ladder rather than as tiers.

*   **Problem P:** Tests the misconception that "A" comes before "S" (Addition before Subtraction). In reality, they have equal priority and are solved left-to-right.
*   **Problem Q:** Tests the standard hierarchy (Multiplication before Addition).

### **The "Confidence" Factor**
This is a **high-misconception question**. Students won't guess randomly; they will confidently select the wrong answer (D) because they have memorised the acronym BIDMAS literally.

### **Predicted Response Distributions**

**Note on groupings:**
*   **Below Basic:** Struggling with basic numeracy.
*   **Basic:** Knows the acronym BIDMAS but interprets it literally (linear order).
*   **Proficient:** Understands standard order but occasionally forgets the left-to-right rule for $+/-$.
*   **Advanced:** Fully understands that $+/-$ and $\times/\div$ are inverse pairs with equal priority.

| Group | A | B (Correct) | C | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 15% | 10% | **55%** |
| **Basic** | 5% | 20% | 5% | **70%** |
| **Proficient** | 5% | **55%** | 5% | 35% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | **95%** | 1% | 2% |

### **Teacher’s Commentary on the Data:**

1.  **The "Option D" Trap:** Among **Basic** students, Option D will be the "landslide" winner. These students have "learnt" BIDMAS. Because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym, they will insist that $5+6$ must be done first in Problem P. This is one of the most persistent misconceptions in lower secondary maths.
2.  **Problem Q is the Filter:** Options A and C are rarely picked by anyone above "Below Basic" because the rule that Multiplication precedes Addition is usually well-drilled by Year 9.
3.  **The Proficient Split:** **Proficient** students are in a "transitional" phase. Many will correctly identify $5 \times 6$ for Problem Q, but under the pressure of a multiple-choice format, 35-40% will still fall back on the literal "A before S" rule for Problem P, leading them to D.
4.  **The Correct Path (B):** Only the **Advanced** students (and the top end of Proficient) consistently remember the "Left-to-Right" tie-breaker rule for addition and subtraction. In Problem P, because they have equal priority, we simply work from left to right ($4-5$ first).
