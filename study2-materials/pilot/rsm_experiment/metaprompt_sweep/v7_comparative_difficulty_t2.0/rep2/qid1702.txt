As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It appears simple, but it targets a specific "cognitive trip-wire": the transition from integer to decimal substitution within a linear rearrangement.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a typical Year 9 class, this sits just above the midpoint. While the algebra is technically "easier" than completing the square, the decimal $0.5$ and the negative coefficient $-6y$ create significant friction.

### The Misconception Profile: "The Decimal Trap"
This is a high **misconception activation** question rather than a random guess question.
*   **The "Plus vs Minus" error:** Students often forget that subtracting a negative becomes an addition, or conversely, they add $3$ to $30$ instead of $30 + 3$ when they move it across.
*   **The Calculation Error:** $6 \times 0.5$ is frequently miscalculated as $6.5$ or $12$ by lower-attaining students.
*   **The Rearranging Error:** Students often get $10x = 33$ then struggle to divide by 10, or they subtract 3 and get $27$, leading them directly to Distractor D.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working at Grade 1/2)**
*These students struggle with the order of operations and the equals sign. Many will see "30", "10", and "0.5" and try to combine them without formal substitution.*
**A=10% B=10% C=30% D=50%**
*D is the "Common Sense" trap: $30 \div 10 = 3$, and $0.5$ is "around there", or they calculate $30 - 3 = 27$ and shift the decimal.*

**Basic (Working at Grade 3)**
*These students can substitute $0.5$ but will make a sign error. They will likely get $10x - 3 = 30$, but then calculate $10x = 27$ instead of adding the 3.*
**A=15% B=5% C=20% D=60%**
*D is the dominant distractor here ($30 - 3 = 27$, then $27 \div 10 = 2.7$).*

**Proficient (Working at Grade 4/5 - Target Y9 level)**
*These students know to substitute and add 3 to both sides. Most will reach $10x = 33$.*
**A=75% B=5% C=10% D=10%**
*The majority will correctly identify A ($33 \div 10 = 3.3$ wait... see how easy the slip is? The correct answer is **3.3**, but if they calculate $30 + 3$ then divide by 10, they get 3.3. **Wait, checking the options...**)*

**Teacher's Note on the Options provided:**
If we solve: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$.
Option C is the correct answer. Interestingly, if a student does $30 + 12$ (doubling instead of halving), they get $4.2$, leading them toward Option A.

**Advanced (Working at Grade 6+)**
*These students treat this as a "quick mark" and are unlikely to slip up unless through sheer over-confidence.*
**A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%**

### Final Predicted Distribution (Total Class Average)
**A=22% B=4% C=44% D=30%**

*   **C (Correct)** is the winner, but only just.
*   **D (The Subtract-3 Error)** will be the most common mistake.
*   **A (The Addition/Scaling Error)** will catch those who get confused between halving and doubling when multiplying by 0.5.
