As a UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. On the surface, it is a simple substitution. However, it sits at a "perfect storm" of three common misconceptions: decimal squaring, order of operations (BIDMAS), and basic multiplication facts.

For a Year 9 student (13-14 years old), the challenge isn’t the algebra; it’s the arithmetic of decimals.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
While the concept is Year 7/8, the decimal arithmetic makes it harder for a Year 9 student than solving a linear equation like $3x + 5 = 20$. It is a high-misconception question rather than a random-guess question.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working at Grade 1-2):**
These students often ignore the indices or multiply the base by the power ($0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$) then multiply by 3. They struggle with decimal places.
*   **A=10% B=40% C=40% D=10%**
*   *Logic for B:* $0.3 \times 3$ is $0.9$, then "square it" but getting the decimal point wrong ($0.9^2 \rightarrow 0.27$ or $0.3^3 = 0.27$).
*   *Logic for C:* This is the "Confidentially Wrong" zone. They do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, then $0.9 \times 2 = 1.8$.

**Basic (Working at Grade 3-4):**
These students know to square first, but they almost always fail the decimal place rule.
*   **A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%**
*   *Logic for A:* $0.3^2 = 0.9$ (common error), then $0.9 \times 0.9 \times \dots$ they get lost and pick something that looks "squared" like $0.81$. Or they do $3 \times 0.3$ and then square the result $(0.9^2 = 0.81)$. This is the most common procedural error.

**Proficient (Working at Grade 5-6):**
These students remember BIDMAS (Square before Multiply) and know that $3 \times 3 = 9$. The battle is whether they think $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.9$ or $0.09$.
*   **A=25% B=55% C=5% D=15%**
*   *Logic for B:* They correctly square $0.3$ to get $0.09$. Then they multiply $0.09 \times 3$. However, a huge portion will mentally slip and do $3 \times 9 = 27$ and place the decimal to make it $0.27$.

**Advanced (Working at Grade 7+):**
These students have high number sense and likely convert to fractions $(\frac{3}{10})^2$ mentally or are fluent in decimal multiplication.
*   **A=2% B=8% C=0% D=90%**
*   *Logic for D:* $0.3^2 = 0.09$. Then $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$. Wait—**Correction for D:**
    Actually, many advanced students will reflexively perform $3 \times (0.3)^2$ as $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. **Option B is actually the correct mathematical answer.**

### Final Distribution (Correct Answer: B)
*The trap here is that Option D looks more "realistic" to a student who forgets a decimal place, but B is the correct calculation ($3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$).*
