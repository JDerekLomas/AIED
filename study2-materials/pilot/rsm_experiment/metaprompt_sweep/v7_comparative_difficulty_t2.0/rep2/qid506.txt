As an experienced UK maths teacher, this is a classic "trap" question. On the surface, it looks like a simple one-step linear equation. However, because it involves fractions and the inverse operation of multiplication, it triggers high-frequency misconceptions regarding how to "move" numbers across an equals sign.

### Difficulty Rating: 6/10
For a Year 9 student, this is significantly harder than a standard integer equation (e.g., $3p = 12$). While the steps are "Basic Skills," the cognitive load added by the fraction makes it a high-misconception task. Many students will intuitively try to make the numbers "fit" into whole number answers or common fractions.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Misconception Analysis:**
*   **A ($1/4$):** The most common error. Students see 3 and 12 and immediately think $12 \div 3$. They ignore the fact that 12 is a denominator.
*   **B ($1/36$):** The **Correct** answer. Requires multiplying both sides by $1/3$ (or dividing by 3).
*   **C (4):** Students multiply 12 by $1/3$ but put the answer in the numerator, or simply see "3 and 12" and perform $12 \div 3 = 4$.
*   **D ($1/9$):** A "confusion" error where students might try to square the 3 or misapply a different operation.

| Group | A ($1/4$) | B ($1/36$) | C (4) | D ($1/9$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 50% | 10% | 30% | 10% |
| **Basic** | 55% | 25% | 15% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 30% | 60% | 8% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | 93% | 2% | 0% |

### Teacher's Commentary on the Distributions:
*   **Below Basic / Basic:** These students will **confidently get it wrong.** They see a 3 and a 12; their brain bypasses the algebraic structure and goes straight to number bonds. $12 \div 3 = 4$ is so deeply ingrained that Option A becomes an "irresistible distractor." In fact, Basic students often score *worse* than Below Basic on A because they have enough knowledge to know the answer shouldn't be a whole number (C), but not enough to handle the denominator correctly.
*   **Proficient:** These students know they need to divide by 3. The error here usually comes from "stacking" fractions. They might write $\frac{1/12}{3}$ and then accidentally compute it as $\frac{3}{12}$.
*   **Advanced:** Most should get this right, though "silly slips" usually lead to Option A through pure speed and lack of checking.
