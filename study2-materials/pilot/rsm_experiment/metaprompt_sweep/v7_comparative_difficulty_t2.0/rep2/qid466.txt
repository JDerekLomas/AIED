As a UK maths teacher, I see this as a classic "distractor" question that tests two distinct concepts simultaneously: **multiplicative inverses (reciprocals)** and **directed number arithmetic (signs)**.

Year 9 students (ages 13–14) often grasp the "flipping" mechanism of fractions but frequently suffer from "sign fatigue"—once they've performed one operation, they neglect the negative sign or over-apply the "two negatives make a plus" rule.

### DIFFICULTY: 6/10
For a Year 9 class, this sits slightly above the middle. It isn’t mathematically complex, but it is high-friction. It intentionally activates the misconception that the answer should be negative because the target ($-1$) is negative.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic:** *Working towards KS3 expectations. Likely to confuse operations or simply look for a "matching" number.*
*   **A=10% B=30% C=20% D=40%**
*   *Rationale:* Many will choose **D** simply because it "matches" the fraction already there, or **B** because they know the fraction must flip but don't grasp the sign rules yet.

**Basic:** *Understand the "reciprocal" rule for making 1, but highly susceptible to sign errors.*
*   **A=40% B=45% C=5% D=10%**
*   *Rationale:* This group knows they need a 4 and a 3 to cancel out. However, a significant portion will fall for the "Negative $\times$ Positive = Negative" trap and confidently pick **A**. Others will overthink and pick **B** thinking "I need a negative answer, so I need a negative in the question."

**Proficient:** *Confident with fractions; mostly stable with negative numbers.*
*   **A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%**
*   *Rationale:* The majority will correctly identify that $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1$. The 15% who pick **B** are likely the "confident errors"—students who instinctively think a negative answer *always* requires two negatives (confusing the rule for a positive product).

**Advanced:** *Strong conceptual understanding of identity and inverses.*
*   **A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%**
*   *Rationale:* High-achieving Year 9s will see this as a simple application of $a \times \frac{1}{a} = 1$. They will check the signs last and move on quickly.

### Teacher's Note on Misconception Activation:
This is a **High Misconception** question. Unlike a question where a student might guess "C" because they are lost, students here will often choose **B** with high confidence. They see the negative sign on the result and instinctively feel they must preserve that "negativity" by including another minus sign in the star, failing to realize the existing $-\frac{3}{4}$ already provides it.
