As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating because it doesn't test the **process** of division, but rather the **conceptual understanding** of zero and the **order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)**.

In a Year 9 context, this is a classic "trap" question.

### Difficulty Rating: 4/10
While the numbers are small, the cognitive load is high due to the presence of the number zero and the subtle formatting of Option B. Most students "know" how to find a mean, but many lack the precision to identify these specific pitfalls.

### The Misconceptions
1.  **The "Zero Doesn't Count" Myth:** Students often believe that because zero has no numerical value in addition, it shouldn't be counted in the divisor (Option C).
2.  **The BIDMAS Trap:** Option B looks like a horizontal transcription of the mean formula. Many students forget that without brackets, only the $7$ is divided by $5$.
3.  **Correct logic, hidden answer:** Option A is mathematically identical to the correct process (as $0$ adds nothing to the numerator but remains in the count). However, some students might doubt it *because* the $0$ isn't visible in the sum.

### Predicted Response Distributions

| Group | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 40% | 40% | 10% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 20% | 45% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 65% | 5% | 15% | 15% |
| **Advanced** | 90% | 2% | 3% | 5% |

#### Teacher’s Analysis of the Distribution:
*   **Below Basic:** These students will jump at **B** because it "looks" like the calculation they would type into a basic calculator (and they aren't thinking about the fraction bar acting as a grouping symbol). Or they choose **C** because they simply count the non-zero digits.
*   **Basic:** This is the peak area for the **C** misconception. These students understand the "Add them up, divide by how many there are" rule, but they intuitively feel that 0 is "nothing," so they divide by 4.
*   **Proficient:** These students recognize that **A** is the correct numerical value. However, a small portion of proficient/high-achieving students might overthink and choose **D**, arguing that the 0 *must* be explicitly written in the numerator for the calculation to be "formally" correct, even though A is mathematically equivalent.
*   **Advanced:** They see through the tricks immediately. They know adding 0 changes nothing ($n+0=n$), so Option A is the only mathematically sound expression for the mean.
