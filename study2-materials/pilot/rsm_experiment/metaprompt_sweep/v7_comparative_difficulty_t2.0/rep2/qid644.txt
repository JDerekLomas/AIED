As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in Year 9 assessments. While the mechanical skill of expanding brackets is a standard Grade 4 (GCSE) or Stage 8/9 (KS3) topic, this question targets the **"signs and operations"** bottleneck rather than the algebraic process itself.

### DIFFICULTY: 4/10

**Teacher’s Analysis:**
This is a high "misconception activation" question. The arrows isolate the constants, removing the complexity of the $p$ variables, but forcing a direct confrontation with directed numbers. Students often "confidently get it wrong" because they process the numbers visually before applying rules.

The two main "distractor traps" here are:
1.  **The Operation Trap:** Seeing "1" and "4" and mentally adding them because there are two terms (leads to 5).
2.  **The Sign Trap:** Overlooking the negative signs or knowing a negative is involved but failing to remember that "a negative times a negative is a positive."

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic** (Working toward Year 7/8 expectations):
These students often struggle to distinguish between the operation required (multiplication) and the numbers they see. They often default to addition.
*   **A (+4): 25%** (May get the right answer by luck or partial rule following)
*   **B (-4): 20%** (Identifies one negative but ignores the other)
*   **C (+5): 15%** (Sees 1 and 4, thinks "total", assumes positive)
*   **D (-5): 40%** (**The most common error**) These students see $-1$ and $-4$ and treat it as a column addition problem $(-1 - 4 = -5)$.

**Basic** (Securing Year 8/9 basics):
These students know that "expanding" means multiplying, but their grasp on negative number rules is shaky under pressure.
*   **A (+4): 40%**
*   **B (-4): 45%** (The "single negative" error: they see $- \times -$ and their brain says "it must be negative")
*   **C (+5): 5%**
*   **D (-5): 10%** (Slightly better at identifying multiplication as the goal)

**Proficient** (Meeting Year 9 expectations):
These students are currently practicing FOIL or Grid Method. They are wary of "the double negative."
*   **A (+4): 75%** (Most identify that $-1 \times -4 = 4$)
*   **B (-4): 20%** (Common slip due to rushing or "sign blindness")
*   **C (+5): 2%**
*   **D (-5): 3%**

**Advanced** (Working at Greater Depth / Grade 7-9):
For these students, this is a "low floor" check. The only errors here would be through extreme carelessness/oversight.
*   **A (+4): 96%**
*   **B (-4): 3%**
*   **C (+5): 0%**
*   **D (-5): 1%**

### Summary of Predicted Performance:
The **"confidently wrong"** answer for Year 9 is **D (-5)**. Students in lower sets frequently conflate the rules for *adding* negatives with the rules for *multiplying* them. In a standard Year 9 mixed-ability cohort, you will likely see a surprisingly high percentage of students choosing **B** or **D**.
