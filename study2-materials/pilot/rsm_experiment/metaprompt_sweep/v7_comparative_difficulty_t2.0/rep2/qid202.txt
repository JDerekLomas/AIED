As a UK maths teacher, I look at this and see a question that is technically "easy" but contains a significant instruction trap and a classic misconception regarding denominators.

For a Year 9 student (13-14 years old), addition of fractions with **common denominators** is a primary school skill (KS2). However, by Year 9, students have often been conditioned to "convert to improper fractions first" for all fraction operations, which leads to errors, or they fall into the trap of adding the denominators.

**DIFFICULTY: 3/10**
(It would be a 2/10 if not for the "Mixed Number" instruction and the common denominator distractor.)

### Predicted Response Distributions

**below_basic:** 
These students often lack "fraction sense." The most common error here is adding everything—the whole numbers, the numerators, and the denominators—leading them directly to D. 
*   **A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%**

**basic:**
These students know to add the whole numbers and the numerators, but many still possess the "add the bottoms" misconception when they aren't concentrating, or they get confused and try to simplify into a format they recognise.
*   **A=55% B=10% C=5% D=30%**

**proficient:**
These students can do the calculation easily. However, "Proficient" Year 9s often default to turning everything into improper fractions (\(11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5\)). If they don't read the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number," they will confidently choose B.
*   **A=75% B=20% C=0% D=5%**

**advanced:**
These students identify the common denominator, add the parts mentally, and satisfy the formatting requirement of the question without needing to convert to improper fractions.
*   **A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%**

### Teacher's Note on Misconception Activation:
The "Confident Wrong" answer here is **B** for high-ability students (ignoring formatting) and **D** for lower-ability students (the classic \(\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d}\) error). Option **C** acts as a "noise" distractor for students who multiply denominators or perform partial calculations.
