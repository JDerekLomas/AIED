This is a staple question for the UK Year 9 curriculum. It tests two distinct skills: the algebraic structure of expanding double brackets (FOIL/Grid method) and the application of directed number rules (integer arithmetic).

### **DIFFICULTY: 4/10**

While expanding brackets is a "Grade 4" (GCSE foundation) skill, the "double negative" makes this a classic trap. Students in Year 9 often grasp the "method" of multiplication quickly but stumble on the final constant term $(-5 \times -7)$.

**The Misconception Profile:**
*   **High Confidence/High Error:** This is not a "random guess" question. Students who get this wrong usually do so with high confidence because they successfully performed three out of the four multiplications correctly but failed the signs.
*   **The "Double Negative" Trap:** Option D is the most "attractive" wrong answer for middle-ability students who correctly sum $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$ but believe that "a negative and a negative stay negative" when multiplying.

### **PREDICTED RESPONSE DISTRIBUTIONS**

#### **Below Basic (Working at Grade 1-2)**
*These students struggle with the FOIL method itself and often add terms instead of multiplying, or simply ignore the signs entirely.*
*   **A=40% B=15% C=15% D=30%**
*   *Note: High distribution on A because they often subtract 5 from 7 to get "2".*

#### **Basic (Working at Grade 3)**
*These students know how to expand but are highly susceptible to the "$-5 \times -7 = -35$" error.*
*   **A=10% B=30% C=10% D=50%**
*   *Note: D is the primary distractor here; they get the $-12m$ correct but fail the sign on the constant.*

#### **Proficient (Working at Grade 4-5)**
*These students are generally reliable with the method and are beginning to self-correct on signs. Most will identify that $-5 \times -7$ results in a positive.*
*   **A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%**
*   *Note: Errors here are usually due to "exam fog" or rushing.*

#### **Advanced (Working at Grade 6+)**
*These students have automated the process of double negatives.*
*   **A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%**
*   *Note: Only fluke calculation slips would lead to an incorrect answer.*

### **Teacher’s Analysis of Options:**
*   **A ($m^2-2m-35$):** Attracts students who **added/subtracted** 5 and 7 instead of combining like terms or used $7 - 5$ for the middle term.
*   **B (The Correct Answer):** Requires correct FOIL and correct sign rule: $(- \times - = +)$.
*   **C ($m^2+12m+35$):** Attracts students who ignore the negative signs in the brackets entirely and treat it as $(m+5)(m+7)$.
*   **D ($m^2-12m-35$):** The most common misconception. Students correctly sum $-5$ and $-7$ to $-12$, but incorrectly apply the addition sign rule to the multiplication of the constants.
