As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question fascinating. It isn't just a test of substitution; it is a test of algebraic fluency and structural awareness.

While "completing the square" is a Grade 7/8 GCSE skill, solving a linear equation for $y$ given $x=0$ is theoretically a Year 7 skill. However, the **format** of this question is a significant "distractor" because the equation is written in the form $ax + by = c$ rather than the functional form $y = mx + c$.

### Difficulty Rating: 4/10
For a typical Year 9 student, this is a "deceptively simple" question. Most will feel confident, but many will trip over the "Zero Effect" or the coefficient of $y$.

### The Psychology of the Distractors:
*   **A (20):** The "Confidence Gap." Students multiply 4 by 5 (the range of x) or simply mix up $4x + 2y$ as $4 \times 5$. 
*   **B (3):** The "Visual Guess." Some students try to find a pattern in the $x$ row and apply it incorrectly, or miscalculate $10 - 4 = 6$ then $6 \div 2$.
*   **C (5):** **The Primary Misconception.** Students see $x=0$, ignore the $4x$ term, and instinctively see "half of 10" or they think if $x$ is 0, $y$ must be the "other half" of the equation's constants. 
*   **D (2.5):** The "Equation Solver Error." Students confuse $x$ and $y$ or think they need to divide 10 by 4.

### Predicted Response Distributions

**Below Basic (Working towards GSCE Grade 1-2):**
*Focus: Recognition of numbers but poor grasp of algebraic substitution.*
*   **A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%**
*   *Note:* C is highly attractive here because they see "0" and "10" and pick the halfway point, or simply guess.

**Basic (Targeting GCSE Grade 3-4):**
*Focus: Can substitute but often fails when the equation isn't $y = ...$*
*   **A=10% B=20% C=55% D=15%**
*   *Note:* This group will confidently get it wrong. They will calculate $4 \times 0 = 0$, but then forget the $2$ in front of the $y$, concluding that $y = 10$. Wait—since 10 isn't an option, they will panic and choose 5 because it "feels" like a mathsy answer to 10.

**Proficient (Targeting GCSE Grade 5-6):**
*Focus: Comfortable with two-step equations and substitution.*
*   **A=2% B=8% C=15% D=75%**
*   *Note:* Most will correctly substitute $4(0) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 10 \rightarrow y = 5$. **Wait—the answer is 5.** Looking at my own logic, the trap isn't that they get it wrong; the trap is the coefficient!
*   **CORRECTION:** I must re-evaluate. If $x=0$, then $2y=10$, so $y=5$. This makes **C** the correct answer. 

**REVISED Predicted Response Distributions (Targeting C as Correct):**

| Group | A (20) | B (3) | **C (5)** | D (2.5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 25% | 20% | 40% | 15% |
| **Basic** | 10% | 15% | 65% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 2% | 3% | 90% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 0% | 0% | 100% | 0% |

**Teacher's Reflection:**
In Year 9, the biggest "incorrect" group would usually come from students who see $4x$ and think the first $y$ value must be the $y$-intercept if it were in $y=mx+c$ form. However, because $x=0$, the
