To predict the performance on this question, we must acknowledge the "illusion of simplicity." While a mathematician sees a one-step division, a student sees a fraction and a coefficient, which triggers specific misconceptions regarding reciprocal operations and basic multiplication facts.

**The Logic of the Errors:**
*   **Option A ($1/4$):** This is the most common "intuitive" error. Students see 3 and 12 and instinctively perform $12 \div 3$. They often ignore the fractional positioning or assume they should multiply the fraction by 3 by cancelling the 12.
*   **Option C ($4$):** Students ignore the "1 over" part entirely, treating the equation as $3p=12$.
*   **Option D ($1/9$):** A systematic error where students subtract or perform an incorrect operation involving $3 \times 3$.
*   **Option B ($1/36$):** The correct answer, requiring the understanding that dividing by 3 is equivalent to multiplying the denominator by 3.
