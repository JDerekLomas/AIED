To accurately predict student performance on this question, we must look at the specific misconceptions surrounding decimals and the order of operations (BIDMAS).

Many students will perform $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then square $0.9$ to get $0.81$ (Option A), incorrectly applying the multiplication before the index. Others will correctly square $0.3$ but mistakenly think $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ rather than $0.09$, leading them to $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ (Option D). This is the most common "successful" route for middle-ability students who forget to count decimal places. Option B ($0.27$) is the correct result of $3 \times 0.09$. Option C ($1.8$) usually stems from $2 \times 3 \times 0.3$ or similar doubling errors.
