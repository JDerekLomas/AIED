As a teacher, my initial reaction is that this is a simple question about including zero in the count. However, looking at the distractors through the eyes of a student, it is much more subtle. 

Option B is a classic "calculator error" trap; many students write calculations horizontally and forget that BIDMAS/BODMAS requires the division to happen before the addition. Option C is the most common conceptual error (ignoring the zero as a "nothing" value). Option A is mathematically correct, but students often hesitate because the "0" isn't explicitly written in the numerator, even though adding it doesn't change the sum.

Here is my prediction of the performance distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=40% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=45% B=20% C=15% D=20%
advanced: A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
