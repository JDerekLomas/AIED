To predict these percentages, I have looked at this through the lens of common classroom misconceptions in the UK (KS3/KS4).

Step 1 is a correct multiplication ($15 \times 4 = 60$).
Step 2 contains a "sign flip" error. Isaac should have subtracted 1 ($60 - 1 = 59$) but instead added 1 ($60 + 1 = 61$).

**Teacher Insight:** Many students see $+1$ on the right and instinctively think "move it to the other side and change the sign," but in the heat of a multiple-choice question, a huge number of students perform the inverse operation *incorrectly* or simply associate the numbers 60 and 1 with 61 without thinking about the subtraction. Lower-ability students often think that because the first step is right, the whole thing "looks right," leading to a high percentage choosing C.

basic: A=35% B=5% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=4% D=2%
