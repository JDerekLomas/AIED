As an experienced teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle this specific concept. While it looks like a simple substitution, it targets two major "tripwires":
1.  **The "Multiplication vs Power" error:** Lower-ability students often multiply the base by the index ($3 \times 4$).
2.  **The "Negative Power" error:** This is the most significant trap. Many students believe that "a negative number raised to any power stays negative," or they perform $(-3) \times (-3) = 9$, then $9 \times (-3) = -27$, and finally $-27 \times (-3) = -81$ because they lose track of the signs or assume the negative must persist.

Crucially, many students use scientific calculators incorrectly for this; if they type $-3^4$ without brackets, the calculator gives $-81$ (BIDMAS/Order of Operations rules). This leads even proficient students to choice C.
