To predict the performance on this question, we must look beyond the simple rule of reciprocals. As a teacher, I know the negative sign is the primary "distractor" here. 

**Below Basic students** often ignore signs entirely or choose a number that "looks like" the ones in the question. They frequently think they need to add or subtract to reach -1, leading them to choose C or D.
**Basic students** understand the reciprocal rule ($\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = 1$) but have a fragile grasp of directed numbers. Many will correctly identify $4/3$ but forget that "negative $\times$ positive = negative."
**Proficient students** are comfortable with the concept of a reciprocal but frequently make "sign errors" when under pressure, making A a very strong distractor for them as they fixate on getting the product to be "1" and overlook the negative sign required for the result.
**Advanced students** will recognize that $(-a) \times b = -c$, and since $c=1$, $b$ must be the positive reciprocal.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
