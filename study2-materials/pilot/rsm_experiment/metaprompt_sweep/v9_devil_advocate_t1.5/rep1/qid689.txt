As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen that many students struggle with equations where the unknown is in the denominator. The most common error is "number-order bias," where students perform the operation $10 \div 5$ or $10 \times 5$ because those are the numbers they see in front of them, regardless of the algebraic structure.

Option C ($p=2$) is the strongest distractor because it satisfies the intuitive $10 \div 5$ logic. Option B ($p=50$) appeals to those who think multiplication is always the inverse of division without checking the position of the variable.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=50% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=23% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
