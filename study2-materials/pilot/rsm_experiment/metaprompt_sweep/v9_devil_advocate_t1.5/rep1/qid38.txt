To predict student performance accurately, we must look beyond the simplicity of the algebraic common denominator and consider the specific traps students fall into at different levels.

The correct answer is **A**. To solve this, students must find a common denominator (typically $2x$). $\frac{4}{x}$ becomes $\frac{8}{2x}$, and $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

**Common Errors:**
*   **The "Add Across" Error (Option B):** Adding numerators ($3+4=7$) and adding denominators ($2x+x=3x$). This is the most common misconception for students who treat fractions like integers.
*   **The "Double the Denominator" Error (Option D):** Adding the numerators ($3+4=7$) but picking one of the existing denominators ($2x$). 
*   **The "Forgotten Denominator Change" Error (Option C):** Multiplying the second numerator by 2 to get 8, then adding 3 to get 11, but losing the $2$ in the denominator during the process.

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will reflexively add the top and bottom (Option B). Some will guess D because it "looks" like the right parts.
*   **Basic:** They recognize the need for a common denominator but often fail the execution. A large portion will get as far as 7 but put it over $2x$ (Option D), while others will fall for the "add everything" trap (Option B).
*   **Proficient:** These students know they need $2x$ as the denominator. The main error here is arithmetic or forgetting to multiply the 4 by 2, leading to Option D.
*   **Advanced:** Most will see the common denominator $2x$ instantly, though under time pressure, a small percentage may make a slip or pick D by adding $3+4$ without adjusting the second fraction.
