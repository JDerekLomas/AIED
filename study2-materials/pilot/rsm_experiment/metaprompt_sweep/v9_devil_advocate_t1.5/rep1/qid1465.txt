To accurately predict student performance on this BIDMAS/BODMAS question, we must look past the simple arithmetic and identify the three major psychological hurdles:
1.  **Multiplication priority:** Forgetting to do $4 \times 2$ first leads to $(3-5+4) \times 2 = 4$ (Option B).
2.  **Left-to-Right vs. Addition First:** Many students are taught "Addition before Subtraction" (the 'A' before 'S' in BIDMAS). This leads them to incorrectly group $(3 - (5+4))$ or calculate the $5+4$ first, resulting in $3-9+8$ or similar errors. 
3.  **Negative Number Handling:** $3-5$ is a common friction point. Students who skip the order of operations often end up with $-10$ (Option D) by calculating $3-5 = -2$, then adding $4$ to get $2$, then multiplying by $2$ to get $4$—or variations involving the sign.

**Option A (6)** is the correct answer: $3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = 6$.
**Option B (4)** is the most common "Calculation Order" error: $(3-5+4) \times 2$.
**Option C (-12)** is a "Rigid BIDMAS" error: $3 - (5+8) = 3 - 13 = -10$, but often skewed by sign errors to reach -12 or via $(3-5+4)$ miscues.
**Option D (-10)** is a "Rigid BIDMAS" error: $3 - (5+8) = -10$, where the student performs addition before subtraction strictly.
