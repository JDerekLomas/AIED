To predict student performance on this question, we must look at the specific algebraic pitfalls involved in rearranging the volume of a sphere formula: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

**Common Errors:**
1.  **Multiplication/Division confusion:** When moving $\frac{4}{3}$, students often fail to "flip" the fraction or incorrectly multiply the $V$ by 4 instead of 3. (Leads to Option A).
2.  **$\pi$ placement:** Students frequently assume $\pi$ stays in the numerator or gets separated from the numerical fraction incorrectly. (Leads to Option B).
3.  **Incomplete root application:** High-ability students occasionally struggle with the typesetting of the cube root; some may think the root only applies to the $V$ if they aren't careful. (Leads to Option D).

**Analysis by Level:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often pick Option A because it contains all the correct symbols but treats them as if they are all being multiplied by $V$, or they simply guess.
*   **Basic:** Many will correctly identify that a cube root is needed but will make a "cross-multiplication" error, placing the 3 on the bottom or the 4 on top.
*   **Proficient:** These students know the formula and the steps. However, under exam pressure, a significant minority will mistakenly group $\pi$ with the 3 instead of the 4 when dividing.
*   **Advanced:** Usually comfortable with the reciprocal nature of $\frac{3}{4\pi}$.
