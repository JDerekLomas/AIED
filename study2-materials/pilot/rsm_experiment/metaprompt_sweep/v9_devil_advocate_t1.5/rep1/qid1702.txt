To predict these percentages, I have evaluated the likely cognitive pathways and common errors:
1.  **Rearranging errors:** Students often struggle with $10x - 6y = 30$. A common mistake is $10x = 30 - 6y$, leading to $10x = 27$ and $x = 2.7$ (Option D).
2.  **Inverse operations:** Subtracting $6 \times 0.5$ (which is $3$) is often mistakenly treated as adding it on the other side before the sign is accounted for, or students simply do $30 + 3$ and divide by $10$ to get $3.3$ (Option C).
3.  **Substitution/Calculation:** $10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$. This is the correct path.
4.  **Misidentifying variables:** Some students will put the $0.5$ into the $x$ instead of the $y$, calculating $5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y \approx -4.2$ (Option B).

The "easy" trap here is assuming students will correctly handle the negative sign and the division. Many find decimals within a linear equation daunting and will look for a number that "looks right."
