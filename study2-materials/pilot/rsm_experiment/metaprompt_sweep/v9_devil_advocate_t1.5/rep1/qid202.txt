As an experienced teacher, my initial reaction is that this is a "level 1" fraction problem. However, looking through the lens of student misconceptions, there are several hurdles. 

The most common trap for lower-ability students is the "add everything" strategy, where they add the numerators and the denominators separately. For middle-ability students, the conversion between improper fractions and mixed numbers often leads to a "correct but wrong format" error. Even though option B is mathematically equivalent, the instruction specifically asks for a mixed number, which many students (especially at the "Basic" level) will overlook if they've been taught to convert to improper fractions first to perform the addition.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=10% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0% D=1%
