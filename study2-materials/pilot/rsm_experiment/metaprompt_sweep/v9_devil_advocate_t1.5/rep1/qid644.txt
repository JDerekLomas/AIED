As an experienced teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle the FOIL/grid method for expanding brackets. While this looks like a simple "negative times a negative" question, the common pitfalls in a UK classroom are specific. 

Low-ability students often "process" the numbers they see without applying the correct operation (multiplication); they see a -1 and a -4 and perform an addition/subtraction, leading to -5 or +5. Mid-level students often remember to multiply but forget the sign rule, choosing -4. Advanced students almost always get this right, though a tiny margin of error exists for "speed slips."

The most common "distractor" for those struggling with algebra is Option D (-5), as students frequently confuse the rules for adding negative numbers with the rules for multiplying them.
