In my experience as a teacher, Problem P is a notorious "trap" for students who have been taught the BIDMAS/BODMAS mnemonic without a deep understanding of operator priority. Many students believe that 'A' (Addition) must strictly come before 'S' (Subtraction). Consequently, even proficient students often incorrectly choose to perform $5+6$ first. Problem Q is more standard, but lower-ability students still tend to work strictly from left to right.

The "Addition before Subtraction" misconception is one of the most persistent errors in Key Stage 3 and 4, often leading to "Option D" being a very popular, yet incorrect, choice.

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=25% D=35%
proficient: A=15% B=40% C=10% D=35%
advanced: A=10% B=80% C=2% D=8%
