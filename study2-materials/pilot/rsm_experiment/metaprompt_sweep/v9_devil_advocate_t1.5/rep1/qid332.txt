In my experience teaching KS3 and KS4, this specific equation structure is a classic "trap" for students. 

While Tom’s step (adding 5 to both sides) is the standard procedure, Katie’s step is a very common misconception. Many students believe they can "multiply by the denominator" to "get rid of the fraction," but they consistently forget that the multiplier must apply to *every* term on both sides, not just the fraction and the answer. They see the $\frac{x}{3}$ and the $12$ and think $x - 5 = 36$ looks "mathematical."

**Below Basic** students often struggle with the order of operations in reverse. They are likely to guess or choose Katie because "multiplying the big numbers" feels like progress.
**Basic** students usually know they should "do the opposite," but often try to do the easiest "opposite" first. Many will see Katie's logic as valid.
**Proficient** students are the most likely to be split. They recognize Tom is right, but many haven't yet mastered the distributive property when multiplying equations, leading them to think Katie's shortcut is also a valid "alternative method."
**Advanced** students will spot that Katie failed to multiply the $-5$ by $3$.
