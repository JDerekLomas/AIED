As a UK maths teacher, I have seen many students tackle linear equations in tables. At first glance, this looks like a simple substitution task, but it contains two significant "traps" for lower-ability students.

1.  **The "Add" Trap:** Many students see $4x + 2y = 10$ and, when $x=0$, assume that because $4+0=4$, the remaining part must be $10 - 4$ or simply $4 + 6$. However, a more common error is seeing the numbers $4, 2, 10$ and mentally performing $4 + 2 + x = 10$, leading them to $4$. 
2.  **The Coefficient Trap:** Many students substitute $x=0$ correctly to get $2y=10$, but then perform $10 - 2$ instead of $10 \div 2$, or they associate the $y$ value with the $x$ coefficient ($4$) or the result of $10 \div 4$ (leading to $2.5$).
3.  **The "5" Distractor:** $C$ is the correct answer ($2y = 10 \Rightarrow y = 5$).
4.  **The "20" Distractor:** Students often multiply the constants they see ($4 \times 5$ or $2 \times 10$) when they get confused by the algebra.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=45% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=75% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=95% D=3%
