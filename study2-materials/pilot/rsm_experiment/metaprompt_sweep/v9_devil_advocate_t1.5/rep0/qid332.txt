In my experience teaching KS3 and KS4, this specific problem type is a classic "traps and pitfalls" question involving the order of operations in inverse algebraic steps. 

Most students (Basic/Proficient) find Tom's step intuitive because they are taught to "deal with the loose constant first." However, Katie's step is the primary source of error. To get \(x-5=36\), a student has multiplied the first and last terms by 3 but neglected to multiply the \(-5\). This is one of the most common mistakes in GCSE foundation algebra. 

Many "Proficient" students will see Katie's line and think, "Yes, you can multiply by 3," without checking if she distributed it to every term. This leads to a high number of 'C' responses. Advanced students will spot that for Katie to be right, the line must be \(x-15=36\).
