As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common student misconceptions regarding BIDMAS (order of operations) and decimal arithmetic. 

The common pitfalls here are:
1. **Miscalculation of $0.3^2$**: Many students believe $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. This leads them to $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ (Option D).
2. **BIDMAS error**: Multiplying $3$ and $0.3$ first to get $0.9$, then squaring it to get $0.81$ (Option A).
3. **Linearity error**: Ignoring the square entirely and doing $3 \times 0.3$ or $3 \times 0.6$, leading to $0.9$ or $1.8$ (Option C).

While the correct answer is B ($0.3^2 = 0.09$; $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$), the "trap" of Option D is incredibly strong even for proficient students because $0.3^2 = 0.9$ is one of the most persistent decimal errors in the UK curriculum.
