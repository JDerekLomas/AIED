To predict the performance of UK students (typically GCSE level) on this question, we must look at the specific common misconceptions regarding algebraic fractions.

**The "Trap":**
The most common mistake at the lower levels is "adding across"—adding the numerators and adding the denominators ($3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$), leading to option B.

At the mid-level, students often understand they need a common denominator ($2x$), but they make a "half-step" error. They change the second fraction to $\frac{8}{2x}$ but then forget to add the 3, or they incorrectly think they need to multiply *both* denominators together to get $2x^2$ and then struggle to simplify.

**A (Correct):** $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$
**B (Add across):** $\frac{3+4}{2x+x} = \frac{7}{3x}$
**C (Denominator error):** Successfully doubles the 4 to 8, but forgets the "2" in the denominator.
**D (Numerator error):** Adds the numerators correctly ($3+4=7$) but uses the denominator $2x$ without adjusting the 4.
