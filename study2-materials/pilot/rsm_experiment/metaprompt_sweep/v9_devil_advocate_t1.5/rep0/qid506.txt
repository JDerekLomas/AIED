As a UK maths teacher, I have seen many students tackle linear equations involving fractions. On the surface, this looks like a simple "divide by 3" problem. However, the presence of the fraction $\frac{1}{12}$ triggers common misconceptions regarding the reciprocal and the relationship between multiplication and division.

**Common Pitfalls:**
*   **The "Multiplying" Error (Option A):** Many students see $3$ and $12$ and instinctively link them via the number $4$. They often think "3 goes into 12 four times" and mistakenly treat the problem as $12 \div 3$, leading to $p = 4$ or $p = 1/4$.
*   **The "Reciprocal" Error (Option C):** Students often flip the fraction when they see a division-like operation, resulting in $p=4$.
*   **The Inverse Confusion (Option D):** Some students mistake $3p$ as needing to be squared or think the 3 somehow becomes a 9 when interacting with the fraction structure.

While $p = \frac{1}{36}$ (Option B) is the correct answer achieved by dividing both sides by 3 ($\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$), many students will fail to multiply the denominators.

Here is the predicted percentage distribution:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=65% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
