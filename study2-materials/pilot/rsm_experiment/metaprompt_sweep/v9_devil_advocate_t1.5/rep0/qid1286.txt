As an experienced teacher, my initial reaction is that this is a straightforward rearrangement task. However, experience tells me that many students struggle with "literal equations" where numbers are absent. 

Common pitfalls I've observed:
1.  **Reciprocal Confusion:** Many students struggle to decide whether the $3$ or the $4$ goes on top. They often associate the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ so strongly with the formula that they leave it intact or flip the entire thing incorrectly.
2.  **Visual Association:** Some students will pick Option A because it "looks" most like the volume formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) as all symbols are in the same relative positions, ignoring the algebraic mechanics of moving terms across the equals sign.
3.  **The "$\pi$ factor":** Lower-ability students often forget that $\pi$ is a multiplier and try to keep it next to the radius without moving it to the denominator.
4.  **The Radical sign:** While most recognise the need for a cube root, Option D attracts students who try to "separate" the cube root from the fraction.

Here is my prediction based on GCSE-level performance data for a Grade 6/7 (Target grade) topic:

below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
