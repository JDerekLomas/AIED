To predict student performance accurately, we must look beyond the simple arithmetic and focus on the **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)**, which is a notorious "poverty trap" in school mathematics.

**Left side: $8 + 12 \div 4$**
Students must divide first ($12 \div 4 = 3$), then add ($8 + 3 = 11$). However, many lower-ability students instinctively work left-to-right, performing $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.

**Right side: $(8 + 12) \div 4$**
The brackets force the addition first: $20 \div 4 = 5$.

**The Trap:**
Lower-ability students will calculate the left side incorrectly as 5 (by ignoring BIDMAS) and see the right side as 5, leading them to choose **C (=)**. 
Middle-ability students often remember that brackets "do something" but might misapply the rule or second-guess their BIDMAS, often landing on **B (<)** if they calculate 11 vs 5 correctly, or **C** if they are overwhelmed.
Only students solid in BIDMAS (Advanced) will confidently see $11 > 5$.

Here is the predicted distribution based on typical UK classroom misconceptions:

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=10% C=23% D=2%
advanced: A=94% B=3% C=2% D=1%
