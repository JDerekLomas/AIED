As an experienced teacher, I have seen many students fall into the "zero doesn't count" trap or fail to respect the order of operations when writing out a calculation on a single line.

**A is the correct answer.** Even though it omits the "$+0$" in the numerator, the sum remains identical, and dividing by $5$ correctly accounts for all values in the data set.

**The Traps:**
1.  **The "Zero Trap" (Option C):** Many students at the "basic" level believe that because zero has no value, it should be ignored entirely, leading them to divide by 4.
2.  **The "Calculator Trap" (Option B):** This is a classic BIDMAS/PEMDAS error. If typed exactly like this into a scientific calculator, only the 7 is divided by 5. Students often overlook this when seeing it written in a horizontal string.
3.  **The "Missing Zero" doubt (Option D):** Higher-ability students might hesitate because the 0 is literally missing from the sum in A, even though mathematically it makes no difference.

Here is my prediction of student performance:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=15% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=1% D=5%
