As an experienced teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle powers and negatives. The "obvious" answer to a mathematician is A, but this question is a minefield for students.

There are three primary traps here:
1.  **The Negative Base Trap:** Students often calculate $3^4 = 81$ and then reflexively re-attach the negative sign, thinking that because the base was negative, the result must stay negative. This leads them to C.
2.  **The Calculator Trap:** If a student types $-3^4$ into a standard scientific calculator without brackets, the calculator correctly follows BODMAS and gives $-81$. Students often trust the calculator over their own knowledge of even powers.
3.  **The Multiplier Trap:** Lower-ability students often multiply the base by the index ($3 \times 4$), leading to B or D.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=38% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=0% C=8% D=0%
