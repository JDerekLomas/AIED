In my experience teaching across the KS3 and KS4 curriculum, this specific combination of problems highlights two very different misconceptions: the "Addition before Subtraction" rule-following trap and the standard Order of Operations.

In Problem P, many students (even proficient ones) have been taught BODMAS/BIDMAS and interpret the "A" before "S" as a strict rule that addition must happen before subtraction, leading them to prioritize \(5+6\). In Problem Q, while BIDMAS helps them identify multiplication should come first, the left-to-right reading habit is a strong competitor for lower-ability students.

The most dangerous distractor here is **Option D**, because it rewards a rigid, literal interpretation of the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS.
