To predict these percentages, I have considered the specific pitfalls of the UK Foundation and Higher tiers. 

The equation $4x + 2y = 10$ is not in the standard $y = mx + c$ format, which is the primary source of error for lower-ability students. While "advanced" students will instinctively substitute $x=0$ and solve the one-step equation, "below basic" students often perform a calculation based on the first numbers they see ($4 + 2 + 10 = 16$ or $4 \times 5 = 20$). Option D ($2.5$) is a strong distractor for those who divide 10 by 4, perhaps confusing which variable is being eliminated.

**Below Basic:** Many will see the 4 and 10 and try to multiply them or find a way to get 20 (Option A). Others will look at the constants in the equation ($4+2$) and guess 5 or 3 as "middle" numbers.
**Basic:** These students often understand they need to do something with 10 and 2, but many will mistakenly look at the $x$ coefficient ($4x$) and perform $10 \div 4 = 2.5$ (Option D). 
**Proficient:** These students usually recognize substitution but may occasionally make a sign error or mental arithmetic slip.
**Advanced:** These students will correctly identify that when $x=0$, $2y=10$, therefore $y=5$.

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=45% D=30%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=85% D=8%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=98% D=1%
