In my experience teaching the UK curriculum (GCSE Foundation and Higher), this specific question type—expanding double brackets with two negative constants—is one of the most common pitfalls in algebra.

Teachers often overestimate how many students remember that "a negative times a negative is a positive." Even for "proficient" students, the cognitive load of adding the linear terms (-5 and -7) while simultaneously multiplying them often leads to a sign error in the final constant term. Option D is a very "attractive" distractor because students arrive at -12 correctly but then keep the negative sign for the multiplication, assuming the "negative pattern" continues.

Here is my prediction of the performance distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
