In my experience teaching this specific type of linear equation, Step 2 is a "classic" error that catches out far more students than one might expect. 

Step 1 is mathematically correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$). However, in Step 2, Isaac should have subtracted 1 from 60 to get $k=59$. Instead, he likely looked at $60 = 1 + k$ and instinctively added 1 to 60, either through a misapplied "change the side, change the sign" rule or simply seeing the numbers and "grouping" them upward. 

Lower-ability students often see any completed "maths-looking" work and assume it is correct if the arithmetic ($15 \times 4 = 60$ and $60 + 1 = 61$) feels right. High-ability students occasionally slip up by rushing, but usually spot the inverse operation error upon review.
