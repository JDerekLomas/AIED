To predict the performance of UK students (typically Years 8–11) on this question, we must look beyond the simple arithmetic and consider common misconceptions regarding negative signs and reciprocals.

**Teacher's Reflection:**
The primary "trap" here isn't the fraction multiplication itself, but the sign management. Many students successfully identify that a reciprocal is needed to reach a magnitude of 1, leading them to $4/3$. However, even at the "proficient" level, there is a strong tendency to think that to get a negative answer, one must multiply by a positive (forgetting that the $-1$ is the *product*, not an addition/subtraction context). 

A very common mistake for "basic" students is to assume the answer is $3/4$ (Option C) because they associate the "inverse" with simply removing the negative sign, or Option D because they think multiplying by itself (or its absolute value) is a "default" move when stuck.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=35% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=10% B=88% C=1% D=1%
