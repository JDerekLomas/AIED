As a UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle equations where the unknown is in the denominator. This is a classic "trap" question.

The primary pitfall here is the "larger number divided by smaller number" instinct. Many students see 10 and 5 and immediately think $10 \div 5 = 2$, leading them to Option C. They ignore the algebraic structure in favour of a comfortable calculation. Others will perform the inverse operation incorrectly ($10 \times 5 = 50$), leading to Option B. Only those who can conceptually grasp that $5 \div 0.5 = 10$ (or multiply both sides by $p$) will reach Option A.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=50% D=5%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=10% C=22% D=3%
advanced: A=92% B=3% C=4% D=1%
