To predict these percentages, I have considered the most common misconceptions found in UK classrooms for Year 7-9 students (KS3). 

While the calculation looks straightforward, the main "traps" involve how students handle denominators and the specific instruction to "leave the answer as a mixed number."

*   **Option A** is the correct answer ($3 \frac{3}{5}$).
*   **Option B** is mathematically equivalent ($\frac{18}{5}$) but ignores the "mixed number" instruction. High-ability students occasionally do this out of habit if they are used to leaving answers as improper fractions.
*   **Option C** involves adding the numerators AND the denominators ($\frac{1+2}{5+5} = \frac{3}{10}$) and losing the whole numbers, or a total misunderstanding of the operation.
*   **Option D** ($3 \frac{3}{10}$) is the most common error for Basic/Below Basic students: adding the whole numbers correctly but adding the denominators together (e.g., $5+5=10$).

below_basic: A=35% B=5% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
