As a UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle FOIL or the grid method for expanding brackets. While this looks like a simple arithmetic check, it specifically targets the two most common misconceptions in secondary algebra: sign rules for multiplication and the confusion between multiplying and adding.

**Below Basic** students often look at $-1$ and $-4$ and see an addition/subtraction problem rather than a multiplication. "Minus one take away four" is a very common thought process, leading them to $-5$.

**Basic** students understand that "expanding" means multiplying, but they frequently lose track of the signs. Many believe that if there are minus signs in the brackets, the result must be negative, leading them to $-4$.

**Proficient** students know to multiply and know that "two minuses make a plus," but under the pressure of a multiple-choice format, a significant minority will still default to addition or lose a sign.

**Advanced** students will see this as trivial but must still be careful not to rush.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=5% D=50%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=96% B=2% C=1% D=1%
