In assessing this question, one must account for the specific pitfalls of decimal manipulation and negative numbers, which are frequent sources of error for UK students in KS3 and KS4. 

The correct calculation is: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$.

Common student errors:
1. **The "Subtracting the 3" error:** Students correctly find $6 \times 0.5 = 3$, but instead of adding it to the other side to cancel the minus sign, they subtract it ($30 - 3 = 27$, leading to **D**).
2. **The "Sign Flip" error:** Students mistake the $-6y$ as needing a sign flip early or lose the negative, leading to $10x = 30 - 3$ then accidentally applying a secondary sign error (leading to **B**).
3. **The "Division/Multiplication confusion":** Lower ability students often see $0.5$ and divide $6$ by it (getting 12) rather than multiplying, leading to $10x - 12 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 42 \Rightarrow 4.2$ (leading to **A** as the "closest looker").
