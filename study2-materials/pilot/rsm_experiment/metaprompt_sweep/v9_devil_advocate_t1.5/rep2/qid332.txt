In my experience as a teacher, this specific equation is a classic "threshold" problem. While Tom’s method is the standard approach (adding 5 to both sides), Katie’s method is the "multiplication trap."

Many students believe that to "get rid of the fraction," you can simply multiply the result by the denominator, forgetting that **every term** in the equation must be multiplied by 3. Because Katie's equation looks "cleaner" and follows the common heuristic of "moving the 3 over," a significant number of basic and proficient students will validate her working without checking the distribution across the -5. 

Lower-ability students often guess "Both" (C) because they have been taught there are "many ways to solve a problem," leading to a false sense of tolerance for incorrect algebraic steps. Advanced students will spot that Katie failed to multiply the 5 by 3 to get $x - 15 = 36$.
