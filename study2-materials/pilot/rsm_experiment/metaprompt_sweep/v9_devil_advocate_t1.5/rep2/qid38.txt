To predict student performance accurately, we must identify the common misconceptions. While many students find algebraic fractions difficult, this specific problem is a "trap" of common denominators.

**Common Errors:**
1.  **"Add across" (The most common error):** Students add the numerators ($3+4=7$) and add the denominators ($2x+x=3x$), leading to option **B**.
2.  **Numerator calculation error:** Students multiply the 3 by something unnecessarily, or correctly identify $2x$ as the common denominator but then add incorrectly.
3.  **Partial scaling:** Students recognise the need for a common denominator of $2x$, scale the second fraction to $\frac{8}{2x}$, but then somehow lose the 2 or miscalculate the sum.
4.  **Successful students:** Recognise that $\frac{4}{x} = \frac{8}{2x}$, therefore $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$, leading to **A**.

**Ability Level Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** Almost universally apply the "add across" rule or guess randomly based on digits they see.
*   **Basic:** Understand fractions need a common denominator but struggle with algebraic terms; many will incorrectly reach B or D.
*   **Proficient:** Generally handle common denominators well but approximately 15-20% will make a "careless" error like $3+4=7$ without scaling the numerator, leading to D.
*   **Advanced:** Should find this straightforward, but under time pressure, a small percentage will still "add across" if rushing.
