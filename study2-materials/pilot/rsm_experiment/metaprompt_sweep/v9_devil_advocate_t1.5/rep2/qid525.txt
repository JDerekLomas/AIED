As an experienced teacher, I have to look beyond the procedural simplicity of this calculation and consider the specific traps laid in the multiple-choice options.

Common pitfalls for this specific question:
1. **The "Add Across" Trap (Option D):** Lower-ability students frequently add the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$), then add the whole numbers. This leads directly to $4 \frac{8}{14}$.
2. **The Common Denominator Error (Option C):** Students who know they need a common denominator often multiply the two denominators together ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but fail to adjust the numerators correctly, or they convert to an improper fraction incorrectly over that denominator.
3. **Format Ignoring (Option A):** The question explicitly asks for a **mixed number**. Option A is numerically correct ($4 \frac{19}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$), but it is an improper fraction. Even high-ability students under exam pressure sometimes calculate the value correctly as an improper fraction and select it without re-reading the final formatting requirement.
4. **Calculational slips:** The correct common denominator is 20. $2 \frac{14}{20} + 2 \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$.

Here is the predicted distribution based on these common student behaviours:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=30% D=45%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=20% B=65% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=10% B=88% C=1% D=1%
