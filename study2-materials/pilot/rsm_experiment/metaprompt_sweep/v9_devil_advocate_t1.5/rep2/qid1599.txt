In my experience teaching KS3 and KS4, this question touches on "hidden" bracket rules and fraction notation. While it looks simple, students at lower ability levels often view division as a left-to-right process and struggle to visualize the horizontal bar as a grouping mechanism. 

The biggest pitfall is Option D (reversing numerator/denominator) and Option C (losing the group). Below basic students often see "c" and "h" and "+4" and pick Option B because they feel the "4" should be applied more broadly, or Option D because they instinctively put the larger-looking expression on the bottom without checking the dividend.

Here is my prediction of the performance breakdown:

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=65% B=5% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=5% D=8%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
