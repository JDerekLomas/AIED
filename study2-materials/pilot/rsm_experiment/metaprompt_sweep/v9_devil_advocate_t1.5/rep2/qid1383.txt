As a UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle powers of negative numbers. The primary hurdle here is not the calculation ($3^4 = 81$), but the conceptual understanding of how negative signs behave under even exponents. 

Many students, even those at the "proficient" level, fall into the "calculator trap" where they type $-3^4$ into a scientific calculator without brackets, resulting in $-81$. Others confuse powers with multiplication ($3 \times 4 = 12$). Below-basic students frequently gravitate towards options B and D because they see "3" and "4" and perform the simplest operation possible.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=40% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=35% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=38% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=0% C=8% D=0%
