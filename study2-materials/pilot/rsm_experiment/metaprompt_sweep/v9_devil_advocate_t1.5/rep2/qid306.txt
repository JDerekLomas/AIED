As an experienced teacher, I have seen thousands of students grapple with BIDMAS/BODMAS. The "danger zone" in this question isn't Problem Q (most students identify the need for multiplication); it is the "Addition" vs "Subtraction" priority in Problem P.

Many students are taught the acronym BIDMAS and take it literally, believing that **A**ddition must always come before **S**ubtraction because 'A' precedes 'S' in the word. They will incorrectly group the $(5+6)$ in Problem P, leading them to Option D. Even proficient students often fall into this "A before S" trap unless they have been specifically taught that addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right.

Below are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=25% C=20% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=45% C=5% D=45%
advanced: A=2% B=85% C=3% D=10%
