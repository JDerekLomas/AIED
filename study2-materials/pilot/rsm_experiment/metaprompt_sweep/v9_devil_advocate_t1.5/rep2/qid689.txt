As a UK maths teacher, I have seen this specific structure of equation trip up thousands of students. The primary issue here is **proportional reasoning vs. mechanical operations**. 

Students who struggle often follow a "larger divided by smaller" rule of thumb, or they incorrectly apply inverse operations by multiplying the numbers they see ($10 \times 5 = 50$) or dividing the way that feels "natural" ($10 \div 5 = 2$). The correct algebraic move—multiplying by $p$ and then dividing by 10—is a two-step process that many students try to bypass with a single-step intuition.

**Choice A ($0.5$)** is the correct answer ($5 \div 0.5 = 10$ or $p = 5/10$).
**Choice B ($50$)** is the result of students multiplying 10 and 5 because they see a division sign and think they must multiply.
**Choice C ($2$)** is the most common distractor; students see 10 and 5 and simply divide the larger by the smaller ($10 \div 5$) without respecting the position of the variable.
