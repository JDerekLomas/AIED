As an experienced teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle this specific structure of equation. While it looks simple, it is a classic "trap" question.

The most common error is a "misapplied inverse operation" where students see the 3 and the 12 and instinctively think of $12 \div 3 = 4$, leading them to Option A ($1/4$) or Option C (4). Students at the **below_basic** level struggle with the concept of dividing a fraction by a whole number and often perform the multiplication $3 \times 12$ to get $36$ but then aren't sure where to put it, or they simply gravitate towards the "nicer" number 4.

**Proficient** students understand they need to divide by 3, but a significant portion will still calculate $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$ incorrectly as $\frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}$ (mistakenly multiplying the numerator). Only the **advanced** students consistently remember that dividing by 3 is equivalent to multiplying the denominator by 3.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
