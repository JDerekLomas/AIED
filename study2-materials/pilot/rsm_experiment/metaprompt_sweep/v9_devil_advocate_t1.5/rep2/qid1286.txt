To predict student performance on this question, we must look at the specific algebraic manipulation required to rearrange $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

Even though "Advanced" students will find this straightforward, there are several common pitfalls for other tiers:
1. **Reciprocal Confusion:** Many students struggle with dividing by a fraction ($\frac{4}{3}$). They often multiply by the numerator instead of the denominator, leading them to Option A.
2. **The $\pi$ placement:** Students frequently move $\pi$ to the wrong side of the fraction bar or forget to include it in the cube root entirely (Option D).
3. **The Cube Root:** Lower-ability students often stop at $r^3$ or apply a square root, though the options here all involve cube roots to guide them.

**below_basic:** Students at this level often guess based on visual familiarity. They see $4/3$ in the original formula and look for $4/3$ in the answer, or they mistakenly associate the $\pi$ with the numerator.
**basic:** These students know they need to rearrange, but often make one "move" incorrectly—most commonly failing to "flip" the fraction when moving it to the other side of the equation.
**proficient:** Most will identify that $3V$ is the first step ($3V = 4\pi r^3$), but a significant minority will then misplace the $4\pi$.
**advanced:** High-performing GCSE students (Grade 7-9) have practiced subject-change drills extensively; they will identify C almost instantly.

basic: A=25% B=30% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
