To predict these percentages, I have considered the following common student misconceptions:
1.  **Sign Blindness:** Many students forget that a negative multiplied by a positive yields a negative. They see a negative answer and assume the multiplier must also be negative.
2.  **The Reciprocal Rule:** Proficient students know they need the "flipped" fraction but can become over-confident and neglect the sign.
3.  **Additive vs Multiplicative Inverse:** Below-basic students often confuse "getting back to 1 (or -1)" with the operations used to get back to zero, leading them to simply change the sign (Option C) or keep the number the same (Option D).
4.  **Calculational Error:** A significant number of students believe that to "cancel" a fraction, you use the same fraction again.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=30% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=85% B=12% C=2% D=1%
