As an experienced teacher, I have seen many students tackle linear equations in tables. At first glance, this looks like a "substitute $x=0$" task, which should be simple. However, the implicit nature of the equation ($4x + 2y = 10$ rather than $y = mx + c$) is a major hurdle for lower-ability students.

**Common pitfalls:**
*   **The "4+2=6" or "10-4=6" trap:** Students often perform the first operation they see. 
*   **Confusion with intercepts:** Many students see $4x$ and think the first value must be 4, or they see the 10 and try to divide it by 4 (Option D).
*   **Option A (20):** Students often multiply everything they see ($4 \times 5$ or $2 \times 10$).
*   **Option D (2.5):** This is a very common mistake where students solve for the $x$-intercept ($10 \div 4$) instead of the $y$-intercept, or simply divide 10 by 4 because they are used to $x$ being the focus.
*   **Option B (3):** Surprisingly common as a "guess" because students think there must be a pattern of 2, 3, 4 across the $y$ values.

**Ability Level Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often guess based on the numbers visible. Option A looks "mathematical" because it's $4 \times 5$. Many will pick D because $10 \div 4 = 2.5$ feels like "solving."
*   **Basic:** They know they need to do something with the 10 and the 2, but often get confused by the $4x$ term. They have a 50/50 chance of picking C or D.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually substitute $x=0$ correctly but might make a mental arithmetic error. They are the most likely to confidently select C.
*   **Advanced:** These students recognise this as finding the $y$-intercept immediately.
