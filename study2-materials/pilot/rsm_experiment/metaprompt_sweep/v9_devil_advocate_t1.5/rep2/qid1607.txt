To predict these percentages, I have applied the "teacher's blind spot" filter. At first glance, this looks like a basic two-step equation. However, the placement of the variable on the right-hand side and the specific error in Step 2 (adding 1 instead of subtracting 1) are classic pitfalls for UK students in Years 7-9.

**Step 1** is correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$). 
**Step 2** is incorrect because Isaac added 1 to 60 ($60 + 1 = 61$) instead of subtracting it ($60 - 1 = 59$).

Students often select "Both are correct" (C) because they see $60$ and $1$ and intuitively feel $61$ is a "related" number, failing to perform the inverse operation. Low-ability students often guess (D) because they find fractions intimidating.
