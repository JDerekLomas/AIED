To accurately predict student performance on this question, we must look beyond the simple arithmetic and consider the common misconceptions in the UK Key Stage 3 and GCSE curriculum.

While "minus times a minus equals a plus" is taught early, it is frequently misapplied or forgotten under the pressure of "expanding brackets"—a topic where students are often overwhelmed by multiple steps. 

1.  **The "Addition" Trap:** Many students, particularly those at the "below_basic" and "basic" levels, see $-1$ and $-4$ and mentally perform $-1 - 4$, leading them to choose $-5$ (Option D) or $+5$ (Option C). This is a classic "operation confusion" error.
2.  **The "Sign" Trap:** Students who know they must multiply ($1 \times 4 = 4$) often struggle with the sign, defaulting to negative because the terms themselves are negative.
3.  **Visual Processing:** Because this isn't asking for the full expansion, some students overthink the "arrows" and assume there must be more to it than simple multiplication.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
