To predict these percentages accurately, we must look at the specific psychological traps within the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

The left side ($8 + 12 \div 4$) is the primary "trap." Students at lower ability levels almost instinctively read left-to-right. They will add 8 and 12 to get 20, then divide by 4 to get **5**.
The right side $(8 + 12) \div 4$ explicitly forces them to add first because of the brackets, also resulting in **5**. 
Therefore, a very large number of "Below Basic" and "Basic" students will conclude the answer is **C (=)** because they calculate both sides as 5.

Students at the "Proficient" level know BIDMAS exists but often apply it inconsistently or experience "attentional bias" where the plus sign feels like it's "linking" the 8 and 12. "Advanced" students will correctly see the left side as $8 + 3 = 11$ and the right side as $20 \div 4 = 5$, concluding $11 > 5$.

The distractor D is rarely chosen as it feels "too complex" for a simple comparison.

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
basic: A=30% B=10% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=28% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%
