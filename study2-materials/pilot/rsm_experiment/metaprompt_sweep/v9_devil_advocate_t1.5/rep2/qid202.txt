As a UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle fraction arithmetic. At first glance, this looks like a "gimme" question because the denominators are the same. However, the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number" and the specific distractors provided reveal the common pitfalls.

**Teacher's Insight:**
*   **A is the correct answer.** It is reached by adding integers ($2+1=3$) and adding numerators ($1+2=3$).
*   **B is the correct value but wrong format.** Students who habitually convert to improper fractions first ($11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$) often forget to convert back to a mixed number as requested.
*   **D is the "denominator adder."** This is the single most common misconception in fraction addition (adding both top and bottom). 
*   **C combines two errors:** Adding denominators ($5+5=10$) and failing to handle the whole numbers correctly (often multiplying $1 \times 2$ or simply ignoring the "3" and just adding the fractions incorrectly).

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=10% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=82% B=12% C=1% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
