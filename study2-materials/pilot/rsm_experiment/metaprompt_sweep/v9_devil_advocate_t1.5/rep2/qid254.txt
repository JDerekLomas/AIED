As an experienced teacher, I have seen many students fall into the "zero is nothing" trap or fail to respect the order of operations when writing calculations on a single line.

Option A is mathematically correct ($0+1+3+4+7$ is the same as $1+3+4+7$, and there are 5 numbers), but many students struggle with the concept of zero being a "value" that contributes to the count. Option B is a classic BIDMAS/PEMDAS error (only the 7 is divided by 5). Option C is the most common error: students often exclude the zero from the count of numbers, thinking "there are four numbers that aren't zero."

Here is my prediction of the percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=50% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=50% B=10% C=30% D=10%
advanced: A=85% B=2% C=8% D=5%
