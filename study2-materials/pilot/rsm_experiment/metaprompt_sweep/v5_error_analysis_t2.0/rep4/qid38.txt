To solve $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator. Multiplying the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$ gives $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

**Teacher's Analysis of Distractors:**
*   **A (Correct):** Requires recognizing the need for a common denominator and multiplying the numerator of the second fraction.
*   **B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** The classic "add across" error ($3+4$ and $2x+x$). This is highly attractive to lower-ability students who treat fractions like integers.
*   **D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** The student recognizes $2x$ as the common denominator but forgets to scale the second numerator, simply adding $3+4$. This is a very common "mid-tier" error.
*   **C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** A less common error, usually involving incorrect cancelling of the '2' or an attempt to multiply the first fraction instead of the second.
