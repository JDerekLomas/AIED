In Year 9, the multi-step linear equation is a classic hurdle. The primary conflict here is the "Order of Operations in Reverse." 

**Tom's method** follows the standard classroom procedure: deal with the addition/subtraction first (add 5 to both sides). This feels "safe" to most students. 
**Katie's method** involves multiplying by the denominator first. This is mathematically sound *if* done correctly ($x - 15 = 36$), but Katie fails to multiply the $-5$ by $3$. Many students miss this subtlety, believing that multiplying the $x/3$ and the $12$ is sufficient.

*   **Below Basic** students often guess or focus on the simplest-looking change. They often think Katie is right because "multiplication undoes division" and they ignore the middle term entirely.
*   **Basic** students recognize Tom's move as the "standard" way they were taught, so they back Tom. Many will assume Katie is wrong because she didn't add the 5 first.
*   **Proficient** students are the most likely to fall for the trap. They know you *can* multiply first, but they often fail to apply the multiplication to the constant term (the $-5$), making Katie's statement look plausible to them.
*   **Advanced** students recognize that for Katie's move to be valid, she must multiply every term by 3 ($x - 15 = 36$). They identify only Tom as correct.
