Having marked 200 of these scripts, this question is a classic "trap" involving the zero.

**The Logic Behind the Errors:**
*   **A (The Correct Method):** Many students realise the sum stays the same but forget that the zero counts as a data point in the divisor. However, here A is actually correct because the numerator effectively ignores the zero (since $0+1+3+4+7 = 1+3+4+7$) but keeps the correct count of 5.
*   **B (The Calculator Error):** Students who use scientific calculators without using the fraction button or brackets get this result ($0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$ becomes $15 \div 5 = 3$, but bidmas makes it $0+1+3+4+1.4$). It "looks" right as a horizontal string.
*   **C (The Count Error):** The most common mistake. Students see four non-zero digits and assume they should divide by 4, completely discounting the 0 as a piece of data.
*   **D (The Over-thinker):** Often chosen by students who think A is wrong because the '0+' isn't explicitly written in the numerator.
