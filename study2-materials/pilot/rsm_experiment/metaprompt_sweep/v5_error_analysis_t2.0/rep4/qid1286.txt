Based on marking hundreds of these papers, here is the breakdown of how Year 9 students typically handle rearranging the sphere volume formula.

**Reflections on common errors:**
*   **The "Multiplying by the fraction" trap (A):** Many students see $4/3$ and decide to multiply $V$ by $4$ then $3$ without considering the inverse operation.
*   **The "Division confusion" (B):** Students often remember that $\pi$ goes on the bottom, but fail to flip the fraction correctly, leading to $4/3$ staying as is.
*   **The "Linear logic" (D):** Lower-ability students often forget that the cube root applies to the entire expression, or they attempt to isolate $r$ by moving numbers haphazardly without balancing the equation.
*   **Proficient vs. Advanced:** Proficient students usually get the algebra right but might make a transcription error. Advanced students are the only ones who consistently deal with the reciprocal of $4/3$ correctly ($3/4$).
