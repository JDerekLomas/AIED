To predict these percentages, I have evaluated the likely misconceptions at each level:

*   **Option A ($0.81$):** A "squared the coefficient" error. Students do $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$. This is very common for students who don't understand BIDMAS/BODMAS in an algebraic context.
*   **Option C ($1.8$):** The most common lower-ability error. Students double the value instead of squaring it ($3 \times 0.3 \times 2 = 1.8$) or mistakenly calculate $2(3x)$.
*   **Option D ($2.7$):** A place value/decimal point error. Students calculate $3 \times 3^2$ and then misplace the decimal point, often forgetting that $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$, not $0.9$.
*   **Option B ($0.27$):** The correct answer ($3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$).

Here is the predicted distribution for a Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=35% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=65% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
