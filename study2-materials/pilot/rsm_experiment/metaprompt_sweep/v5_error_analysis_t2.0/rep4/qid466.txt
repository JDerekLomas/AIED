To get a result of $-1$ when multiplying by $-\frac{3}{4}$, a student must identify that the missing value must be the **reciprocal** and must have a **positive product** (meaning the signs must match, or in this case, the second value must be positive because the result is negative).

**Thinking Process:**
*   **The Trap (Option B):** This is the most "attractive" distractor. Students are drilled that "two negatives make a positive." Because the target is $-1$, many students see the negative sign on $-\frac{3}{4}$ and reflexively pick a negative fraction ($-4/3$) because they associate "finding the reciprocal" with "keeping the same sign."
*   **Calculation Error (Option C):** Common at lower levels; students see $-3/4$ and $-1$ and think "What do I add/subtract?" or simply pick the positive version of the original fraction.
*   **The Inverse Error (Option D):** Choosing the same number is a classic confusion between additive and multiplicative inverses.

**Teacher's Predictions:**

*   **Below Basic:** These students often ignore signs or reciprocals and look for "similar looking" numbers. They frequently pick D because they see $-3/4$ in the question.
*   **Basic:** This group usually knows it’s a reciprocal but almost always falls into the "double negative" trap, thinking they need a negative to "match" the first fraction, not realizing two negatives would result in positive $1$.
*   **Proficient:** These students correctly identify the reciprocal ($4/3$). About a third will still make a silly sign error, but the majority will double-check that $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1$.
*   **Advanced:** These students see the answer immediately and rarely fall for the sign trap.
