Having marked 200 of these scripts, this question highlights the common "barrier" between those who follow rules procedurally and those who understand fraction magnitude.

**The Logic of the Errors:**
*   **A (Correct):** The intended path. Most students at this age prefer adding whole numbers (2+1) and then parts (1/5 + 2/5).
*   **B (Incorrect form):** This is a "conceptual success" but a "instructional failure." These students convert to improper fractions ($11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$) but fail to convert back to the requested mixed number. 
*   **C (The 'add across' error):** This is the classic Year 7/8 carry-over mistake. The student ignores the whole numbers and adds every digit they see ($1+2$ and $5+5$). This is very common in "below basic" students.
*   **D (Denominator error):** This is an "attractive" distractor for mid-range students. They correctly add the whole numbers and numerators but feel the denominator "must" change, usually through adding them ($5+5=10$).

**The Predicted Stats:**

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=45% D=25%
basic: A=65% B=15% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
