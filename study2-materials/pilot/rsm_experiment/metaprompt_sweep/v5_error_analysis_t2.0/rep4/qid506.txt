Having just sat at my kitchen table for six hours marking 200 of these, I can tell you that this question is the ultimate "fraction-blindness" trap for Year 9s.

**The thought process behind the errors:**
*   **A ($1/4$):** This is the most common error. Students see $3$ and $12$ and their brain performs $12 \div 3 = 4$. They keep the fraction structure but place the result as the denominator.
*   **C ($4$):** The "logic" here is the same as A, but the student has completely ignored the fact that the original number was a fraction, or they've intuitively multiplied $12 \times \frac{1}{3}$ and misplaced the reciprocal.
*   **D ($1/9$):** This is a specific processing error where a student thinks they need to square the 3 or they subtract the numerator from the denominator before attempting to divide.
*   **B ($1/36$):** The correct method ($\frac{1}{12} \div 3$, or $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$). 

Lower-ability students rarely think "multiply both sides by 1/3"; they think "move the 3 and do the opposite," but "opposite" to a fraction often results in them mistakenly multiplying $12 \times 3$ to get 36, then putting it on the top (D) or assuming the 1 remains. The $1/4$ distractor is a "magnetic" answer because 12 and 3 are so commonly linked to 4 in their times tables.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
