Having marked 200 of these scripts, this question is a classic "fraction trap" that separates those who follow rote procedures from those who understand the reciprocal nature of division.

**Thinking Process:**
*   **The Trap for Option A:** This is the most common error. Students see "3" and "12" and instinctively perform $12 \div 3$. They ignore the fact that the 12 is a denominator, leading them to $1/4$.
*   **The Trap for Option C:** These students simply multiply $3 \times 12$ but forget it’s a fraction, or they perform $12 \div 3 = 4$ and lose the fraction structure entirely.
*   **The Trap for Option D:** A smaller group often misidentifies the coefficient or subtracts 3 from the 12 incorrectly, or tries to square/cube roots subconsciously.
*   **Correct Answer (B):** Requires multiplying both sides by $1/3$ or dividing by 3. $1/12 \times 1/3 = 1/36$. Only the high-ability students avoid the lure of the "easy" division $12 \div 3$.
