To solve $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator. The most common error is failing to scale the numerator of the second fraction when equalising the denominators to $2x$ (resulting in $\frac{3+4}{2x} = \frac{7}{2x}$), or simply adding across the numerators and denominators (resulting in $\frac{7}{3x}$).

**A) $\frac{11}{2x}$** (Correct: $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}$)
**B) $\frac{7}{3x}$** (The "freshman's dream": adding $3+4$ and $2x+x$)
**C) $\frac{11}{x}$** (Correct numerator but forgot the $2$ in the denominator)
**D) $\frac{7}{2x}$** (Found the common denominator but forgot to multiply the numerator $4 \times 2$)
