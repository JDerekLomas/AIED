To predict the performance of Year 9 students on this specific question, we must look at the common misconceptions surrounding squaring decimals and the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

**The Calculation Logic:**
*   **The Correct Method:** $0.3^2 = 0.09$, then $0.09 \times 3 = \mathbf{0.27}$ (Option B).
*   **Distractor A (0.81):** The student squares both numbers or squares the result of $(3 \times 0.3)$. They do $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$. This is a very common "Linear-first" BIDMAS error.
*   **Distractor C (1.8):** The student misunderstands the exponent. They calculate $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$. 
*   **Distractor D (2.7):** A simple place value error when multiplying $3 \times 0.09$, or more likely, doing $0.3 \times 3 = 0.9$ and then accidentally multiplying by 3 again but misplacing the decimal.

**Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often struggle with decimals and powers. They frequently pick C because they treat squaring as "multiplying by 2".
*   **Basic:** They know to square $0.3$, but they often think $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ (forgetting the second decimal place). This leads them to $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ (Option D). Alternatively, they follow the expression left-to-right (Option A).
*   **Proficient:** They usually follow BIDMAS correctly but are highly susceptible to the "one decimal place" trap ($0.3^2 = 0.9$). Many will land on D.
*   **Advanced:** These students know that $3^2=9$ means $0.3^2 = 0.09$. They are the only ones consistently reaching B.
