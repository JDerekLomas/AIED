To predict these results, I’ve looked at the common misconceptions surrounding the **order of operations in reverse** (SAMDEB) when solving two-step equations.

**The "Katie Trap":** This is the most common error. Students see a denominator and want to "multiply everything by 3" to get rid of it. However, they frequently forget that they must multiply *every term* on both sides, including the $-5$. Those who don't distribute the multiplication to the constant see $x - 5 = 36$ as perfectly logical.

**The "Tom Strategy":** Adding 5 to both sides is the standard, taught method for this equation. Most students recognise this as "moving the 5," making Tom appear correct to almost everyone except those with severe arithmetic or inverse-operation confusion.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=22% D=3%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%
