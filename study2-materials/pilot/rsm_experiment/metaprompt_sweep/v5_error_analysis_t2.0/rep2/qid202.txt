Having marked 200 of these scripts, this question highlights the common "add the denominators" misconception and the "improper vs mixed" instruction hurdle. 

**Diagnostic Analysis:**
*   **Option A (Correct):** Adding whole numbers ($2+1=3$) and adding numerators ($1+2=3$) while keeping the denominator constant. 
*   **Option B (Instructional Error):** The correct value as an improper fraction ($\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}$). Many students default to converting everything to improper fractions first and forget to convert back despite the instruction.
*   **Option C (Conceptual Disaster):** Adding the numerators and the denominators ($\frac{3}{10}$) without regard for the whole numbers or common denominators.
*   **Option D (The Denominator Trap):** Adding the whole numbers correctly but then adding the denominators ($5+5=10$). This is the most "attractive" error for lower-attaining students.
