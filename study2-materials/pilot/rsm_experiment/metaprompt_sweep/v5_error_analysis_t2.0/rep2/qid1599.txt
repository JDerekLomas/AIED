In marking 200 of these Year 9 mocks, the common pitfalls for this specific question are "division order" (the fraction flip) and "term-by-term division" (failing to see the expression in brackets as a single denominator).

**Option D** is the most dangerous trap for mid-range students who understand that division becomes a fraction, but habitually put the "bigger" looking expression or the second term on top, or simply confuse numerator and denominator placement. **Option C** attracts those who struggle with BIDMAS/order of operations in an algebraic context, effectively "dropping" the brackets.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 performance:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=20% D=25%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
