In this Year 9 mock, this question specifically tests the intersection of index laws, negative numbers, and substitution. 

The most "attractive" error is **C**, caused by the common misconception that a negative number raised to an even power remains negative, or by students entering `-3^4` into a non-scientific calculator without brackets. Options **B** and **D** represent the standard confusion between exponents and multiplication (doing $k \times 4$ instead of $k^4$).

**below_basic:** A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
(Most will default to multiplication ($3 \times 4 = 12$); the negative sign is often applied haphazardly.)

**basic:** A=25% B=15% C=40% D=20%
(Students here recognize powers but frequently fall for the "negative base trap" (Option C). They also still have a high tendency to multiply the base by the index (Option D).)

**proficient:** A=60% B=5% C=30% D=5%
(These students know $3^4=81$. The primary hurdle remaining is whether they believe $(-3)^4$ is positive or negative. Option C is the dominant error for this group.)

**advanced:** A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
(Nearly all high-level Year 9 students know that an even power results in a positive value. The tiny margin for C accounts for those working too quickly and making a "silly" sign error.)
