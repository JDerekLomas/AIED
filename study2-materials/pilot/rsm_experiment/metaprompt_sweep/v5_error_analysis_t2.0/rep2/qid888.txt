In this context, I am looking for common misconceptions surrounding "Directed Numbers" (integers) and the FOIL/Grid method. 

The primary pitfalls for Year 9s here are:
1.  **The "Add then Multiply" rule for signs:** Students often remember that a "negative and a negative make a positive," but apply it inconsistently. They may correctly get $+35$ for the constant but then think $-5 + -7$ equals $+12$ (Option C) or a positive minus a negative becomes subtraction (Option A).
2.  **The Constant Sign:** By far the most common error is correctly calculating $-5 - 7 = -12$ but then incorrectly multiplying $-5 \times -7$ to get $-35$. This makes Option D a very "attractive" distractor for middle-attainment students who focus heavily on the linear term.
3.  **Basic Arithmetic:** "Below Basic" students often mistake $-5$ and $-7$ as having a difference of 2, leading to Option A.

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 mock papers:

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=0% D=2%
