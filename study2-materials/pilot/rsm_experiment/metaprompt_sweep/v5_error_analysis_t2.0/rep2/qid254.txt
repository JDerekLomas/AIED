Having marked hundreds of these scripts, this specific question is a classic "trap" designed to test both the conceptual understanding of the number zero in statistics and the mathematical literacy of BODMAS/BIDMAS.

Here is the breakdown of why students choose these options:
*   **Option A (The Correct Answer):** This requires the student to realise that the zero must be included in the count of the denominator (5 numbers total) even if it doesn't change the sum.
*   **Option B (The Calculator Trap):** Many lower-ability students write this. It represents exactly how they would type it into a non-scientific calculator or a cheap phone app. They don't realise that without brackets or a fraction bar, only the 7 is being divided by 5.
*   **Option C (The "Zero Doesn't Count" Error):** Extremely common at the Basic and Proficient levels. Students often learn the rule as "add up the numbers that are there," and they see the 0 as "nothing," leading them to divide by 4.
*   **Option D (The Over-Thinker):** Some advanced students might pick this if they believe Option A is "wrong" because the 0 isn't explicitly written in the numerator (even though $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 1+3+4+7$).
