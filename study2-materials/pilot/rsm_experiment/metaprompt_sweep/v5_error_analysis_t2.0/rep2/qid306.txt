To predict these results, I’ve considered the most common Year 9 misconceptions regarding BIDMAS (order of operations).

In **Problem P**, the "addition comes before subtraction" myth is the single biggest trap. Students see 'A' before 'S' in BIDMAS and incorrectly think they must calculate $5+6$ first, regardless of the negative sign. 
In **Problem Q**, the classic error is reading from left-to-right, performing $4+5$ before the multiplication.

*   **Option A** is for the student who works purely left-to-right (ignores priority rules).
*   **Option B** is the correct application of priority (Left-to-right for equal priority $+/-$; multiplication before addition).
*   **Option C** is the "worst" answer, applying the addition myth in P and the left-to-right error in Q.
*   **Option D** is for the student who follows the *literal* acronym order of BIDMAS ($A$ comes before $S$), leading to an error in P, even though they correctly prioritise the multiplication in Q.
