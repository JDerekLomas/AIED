In my experience marking hundreds of these Year 9 algebra questions, the "Katie error" is one of the most persistent misconceptions. 

Students at the lower end often default to performing the "inverse" operation they see first without regard for order of operations (BIDMAS in reverse for equations). Tom's method is the standard "balance" approach (adding 5 to both sides). Katie's method is the "multiply everything by 3" approach, but students frequently forget that the -5 must also be multiplied by 3. Because $x-5=36$ *looks* like a logical step (clearing the fraction), it is incredibly "attractive" to students who understand the concept of inverses but not the distributive property.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=20% B=35% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=28% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%
