After marking hundreds of these papers, it's clear that this question hinges entirely on a student's commitment to the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

The LHS is $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$. 
The RHS is $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$.
Since $11 > 5$, the correct answer is **A**.

The primary trap for lower-ability students is reading the LHS from left to right ($8+12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$). This leads them to see $5 \square 5$, making Option C (equal to) the most common "common-sense" error. Students in the middle often correctly identify the RHS as 5, but lapse on the LHS by not applying BIDMAS, reinforcing the choice of C.

**below_basic:** A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
(These students almost exclusively work left-to-right. They see $8+12$ on both sides and assume equality, or calculate $5 = 5$ and pick C.)

**basic:** A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%
(Students here are aware of BIDMAS but often apply it inconsistently. Many will calculate the RHS correctly but still fall into the left-to-right trap on the LHS.)

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
(At this level, the majority identify that the division on the left must happen first. The errors here are usually from rushing or slight mental arithmetic slips.)

**advanced:** A=97% B=1% C=1% D=1%
(High-achievers see the structure immediately. Only a rare 'silly mistake' under exam pressure would lead to an incorrect answer.)
