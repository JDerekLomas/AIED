Having marked 200 of these, I can tell you that this is one of the most common "trip-up" questions in the Year 9 curriculum.

The common errors are very predictable:
*   **B (50)** is the most common error for **Basic** students because they see a 10 and a 5 and immediately perform the most basic operation (multiplication) to "clear" the fraction, but they multiply $10 \times 5$ instead of understanding that $p$ is the denominator.
*   **C (2)** is the classic "Calculation Instinct" error. Students see 10 and 5 and their brain outputs "2" because $10 \div 5 = 2$. They ignore the structure of the equation and just divide the larger number by the smaller one. This is highly attractive to **Below Basic** and **Basic** students.
*   **A (0.5)** requires the student to correctly rearrange the equation to $10p = 5$ and then $p = 5/10$. This is where **Proficient** students live. **Advanced** students handle this instinctively, while weaker students rarely reach the decimal/fraction stage correctly.

Here are the predicted percentages based on a typical Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=45% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
