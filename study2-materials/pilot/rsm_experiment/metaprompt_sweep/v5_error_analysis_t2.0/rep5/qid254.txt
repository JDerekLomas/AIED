Having just marked a stack of these, the "zero" in the data set is always the undoing of a Year 9 student. They often treat it as "nothing," leading to its omission in the sum or, more frequently, its omission from the divisor.

Here is the breakdown based on common misconceptions:

*   **A is the correct calculation.** It recognizes that the sum remains the same whether the 0 is written or not, but it must be counted in the divisor ($n=5$).
*   **B is a classic "calculator" error.** Students know the steps (add then divide) but don't understand the order of operations (BIDMAS). On a calculator, this sequence divides only the 7 by 5.
*   **C is the "invisible zero" error.** Students assume that because a number has no value, it shouldn't be counted in the total number of values ($n=4$).
*   **D is for the over-thinkers** who believe the 0 *must* be explicitly written in the numerator for the expression to be "correct," even if the value is the same.

**Predicted Performance:**
