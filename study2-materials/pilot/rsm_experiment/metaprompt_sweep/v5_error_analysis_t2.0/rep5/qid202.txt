Having marked 200 of these scripts, this question highlights the common conflict between Year 9 students' ability to perform the basic operation and their ability to follow specific formatting instructions (the requirement for a mixed number).

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A (Correct):** The most straightforward path. Adding the integers $(2+1)$ and the fractions $(1/5+2/5)$. 
*   **B (Misinterpreting Format):** This is a very "attractive" wrong answer for higher-ability students. They often convert to improper fractions $(\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5})$ to ensure accuracy, then forget to convert back to a mixed number as requested by the prompt.
*   **C (The "Add Everything" Error):** Common in lower sets where students add the numerators AND the denominators $(1+2=3, 5+5=10)$. They then forget or ignore the whole numbers entirely.
*   **D (The Denominator Trap):** Students who correctly add the whole numbers $(2+1=3)$ but succumb to the classic misconception of adding the denominators $(5+5=10)$.
