To solve $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, students must find a common denominator (usually $2x$). This involves doubling the numerator and denominator of the second fraction: $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

**Teacher's Marking Notes:**
*   **The Trap (Option B):** This is the classic "add across" error ($3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$). It is highly attractive to below-basic students who treat algebraic fractions like integers.
*   **The Logic Error (Option D):** Students recognise they need $2x$ as a denominator but forget to adjust the numerator of the second fraction. They simply add $3+4$ over the "biggest" denominator.
*   **The Partial Logic (Option C):** Rare, but happens when a student tries to make the denominator $x$ by dividing the first fraction by 2 but fails to handle the 3 correctly, or clears denominators entirely as if it were an equation.
