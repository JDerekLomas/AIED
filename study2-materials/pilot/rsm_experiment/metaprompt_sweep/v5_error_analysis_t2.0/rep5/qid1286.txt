To predict the performance for this Year 9 mock question, we must consider the rearranging steps for $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

*   **Option C** is the correct answer.
*   **Option A** is a "multiplication trap." Students see the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ and instinctively multiply $V$ by the numerator and $\pi$, failing to understand they must multiply by the reciprocal or divide.
*   **Option B** is the result of partially correct logic but misplaced symbols—usually multiplying by 4 and dividing by 3 instead of vice-versa.
*   **Option D** represents a fundamental algebraic failure: taking the cube root of only $V$ and then attempting to apply the rest of the formula coefficients as a linear multiplier.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=15% D=20%
*(These students guess based on which looks 'most like' the sphere formula or perform one-step operations incorrectly.)*

basic: A=35% B=25% C=25% D=15%
*(The "multiplication trap" is highly attractive here. They know $r^3$ involves a cube root but struggle with the fraction/coefficient division.)*

proficient: A=15% B=15% C=65% D=5%
*(Most can rearrange multi-step equations, but some still slip up on the fraction $4/3$ or accidentally leave $\pi$ in the numerator.)*

advanced: A=2% B=3% C=95% D=0%
*(The only errors here are likely due to rushing rather than a lack of understanding.)*
