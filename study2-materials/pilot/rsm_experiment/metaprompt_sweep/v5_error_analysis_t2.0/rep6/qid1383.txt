In my experience marking this specific question type, the negative sign is the primary "discriminator." 

Students at the lower end often confuse powers with multiplication. Students in the middle usually understand powers but struggle with the sign rule (odd vs. even powers) or, crucially, they use a non-scientific calculator and type $-3^4$ without brackets, which yields $-81$, making Option C an incredibly "sticky" distractor. Only the highest achievers consistently remember that a negative number raised to an even power must be positive.

**Error Analysis:**
*   **A (81):** The correct calculation.
*   **B (12):** The common "multiplication error" ($k \times 4$ or $-3 \times 4$ but ignoring the sign).
*   **C (-81):** The "sign error." Students do $3^4$ correctly but assume the negative persists, or they rely on a calculator without using brackets.
*   **D (-12):** The "multiplication error" where the negative sign is retained ($k \times 4$).

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on a typical Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
