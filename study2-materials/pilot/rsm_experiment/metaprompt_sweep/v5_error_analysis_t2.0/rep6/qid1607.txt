After marking 200 of these, I’ve seen exactly where students trip up on this two-step equation.

**Step 1** is almost universally managed correctly ($15 \times 4 = 60$). The "trap" is **Step 2**. To solve $60 = 1 + k$, the inverse operation is subtraction ($60 - 1 = 59$). However, many students see the "$1$" and the "$60$" and instinctively "collect" them to make $61$, incorrectly adding instead of subtracting. 

*   **Below Basic** students often think both steps look "maths-y" enough to be right, or they guess D because they assume a trick question.
*   **Basic** students often get Step 1 right but fall for the additive inverse error in Step 2, leading them to Option C.
*   **Proficient** students usually spot the error in Step 2, knowing that it should be $k = 59$, thus choosing A.
*   **Advanced** students see the error instantly and rarely second-guess themselves.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=2% C=15% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
