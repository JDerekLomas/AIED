After marking 200 of these, the "star" question in a table of values remains a classic separator. The implicit nature of $4x + 2y = 10$ is significantly more difficult for Year 9s than the standard $y = mx + c$ format.

Here is my prediction based on those scripts:

**Calculation Analysis:**
*   **A (20):** A common "blind multiplication" error where students see $x=0$, but then mistakenly calculate $4 \times 5 = 20$ or confuse the coefficient of $y$ as a multiplier for the total.
*   **B (3):** This is the "slope/pattern" error. Students find $y=5$ for $x=0$ correctly, then find $y=3$ for $x=1$, but because "3" is the second number in their mental sequence, they occasionally tick it by misreading which box the star is in.
*   **C (5):** The correct answer. If $x=0$, $4(0) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 10 \rightarrow y = 5$.
*   **D (2.5):** The "operation reversal" or "division trap." Students divide the total (10) by the coefficient of $x$ (4) instead of the coefficient of $y$. 

**Breakdown by ability:**

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=20% D=30%
*(Note: These students often guess based on the numbers they see in the equation; 2.5 and 20 are very attractive to them.)*

basic: A=15% B=20% C=40% D=25%
*(Note: These students often start to solve it but get confused by the two variables; many will do 10 divided by 4 or simply lose track of the 0.)*

proficient: A=5% B=10% C=75% D=10%
*(Note: Most will substitute $x=0$ correctly. The few who miss it usually fail to divide by the coefficient of $y$ or misread the table.)*

advanced: A=0% B=2% C=96% D=2%
*(Note: These students will find this trivial; errors here are almost exclusively due to rushing or misclicking.)*
