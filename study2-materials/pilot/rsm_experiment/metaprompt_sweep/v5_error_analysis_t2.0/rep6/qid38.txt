To simplify $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator. The most direct method is changing $\frac{4}{x}$ into $\frac{8}{2x}$. Adding these gives $\frac{11}{2x}$ (Option A).

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** The classic "add across" error ($3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$). This is the most common mistake for students who lack confidence with fractions.
*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** A partial success where the student recognizes $2x$ as the common denominator but fails to adjust the numerator of the second fraction, simply adding $3+4$.
*   **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** A calculation error where the student correctly identifies 11 but mistakenly "simplifies" the denominator or doubles the first fraction instead of the second.

**Predicted Performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** High density on Option B; these students treat fractions as four independent integers.
*   **Basic:** Many fall for Option D. They know denominators must be the same to add, but forget the "equivalent fraction" rule for the numerator.
*   **Proficient:** Most will reach Option A, though a small percentage will make a silly error leading to D.
*   **Advanced:** Should achieve near 100% accuracy, only dropping marks to rare "processing" slips.
