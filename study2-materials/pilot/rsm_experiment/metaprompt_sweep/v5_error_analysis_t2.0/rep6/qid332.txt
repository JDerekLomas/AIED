To predict the performance for this Year 9 mock question, we must look at the specific algebraic misconceptions at play.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Tom's logic (+5 to both sides):** This is the standard first step taught in UK schools ("add the constant first"). Most students recognize this as correct.
*   **Katie's logic (Multiply by 3):** This is the classic "balance" trap. To multiply by 3, you must multiply *every* term. Katie failed to multiply the -5. 
*   **The Trap:** Weak students see \(12 \times 3 = 36\) and assume the line is correct because the arithmetic is correct, ignoring the distribution rule. Proficient students often fall for "Only Katie" because they have been told "clear the fraction first" but haven't mastered doing it to the whole side.

**Predicted Distributions:**

**below_basic:** (Students guess based on what 'looks' like maths or choose D because they are confused).
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=30% D=15%

**basic:** (These students recognize Tom's +5, but they are very likely to think Katie's \(12 \times 3\) is clever/correct as well).
basic: A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%

**proficient:** (These students are confident with Tom, but a significant portion will still overlook that Katie didn't multiply the -5).
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%

**advanced:** (Top set Year 9s should spot that Katie failed to distribute the 3, but a few might rush and see C as an easy mark).
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%
