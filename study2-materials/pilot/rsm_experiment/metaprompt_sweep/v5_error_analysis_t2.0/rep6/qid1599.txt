To predict these results, I have considered the following common Year 9 misconceptions:
*   **The Dividend/Divisor Swap (D):** Weak students often assume the "bigger" expression ($h+4$) must be the denominator, or they simply confuse the order of division operations.
*   **The "Floating Constant" Error (C):** Students who treat algebra as a left-to-right transcription often write the fraction for the first two terms they see ($c \div h$) and then just append the $+4$ at the end.
*   **The Miscopy Error (B):** This is a "noise" distractor where students accidentally repeat the $+4$ on the numerator, often because they are looking at the bracketed term too intensely.
*   **Bracket Awareness:** High-ability students recognise that the brackets mandate the fraction bar act as a grouping symbol.

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 Year 9 mock papers:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=55% B=5% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=8% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
