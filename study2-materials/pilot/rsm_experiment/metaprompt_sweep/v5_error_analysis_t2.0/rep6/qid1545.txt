To arrive at these predictions, I have considered the most common Year 9 misconceptions regarding **BIDMAS/BODMAS**. 

**The Thought Process:**
*   **The Trap:** Students often read maths from left to right like a sentence. On the LHS, $8 + 12 \div 4$, a weaker student will do $8+12=20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$. This leads them to think both sides equal $5$, making Option **C** the most attractive distractor for "Below Basic" and "Basic" tiers.
*   **The Logic:** $8 + (12 \div 4) = 11$, whereas $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 5$. Since $11 > 5$, **A** is the correct answer.
*   **The Errors:** Students who remember "Brackets first" but forget "Division before Addition" will correctly evaluate the RHS as $5$ but incorrectly evaluate the LHS as $5$, choosing **C**. Students who guess or have a vague notion that the side with the brackets "must be bigger" choose **B**. **D** is rarely chosen unless a student is genuinely guessing at symbols they don't recognise.

Here are the predicted percentages based on a typical UK Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=50% D=5%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=10% D=0%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
