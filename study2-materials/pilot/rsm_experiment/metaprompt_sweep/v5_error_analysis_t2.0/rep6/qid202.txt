Having marked thousands of these over the years, I can tell you that the main barrier here isn't the addition itself, but the "processing noise" of the fractions. 

**Option A** is the correct answer. It's a simple case of adding the wholes and the numerators.
**Option B** is the correct value but wrong format. Many students reflexively convert to improper fractions and forget to convert back, especially if they’ve been drilled on "mixed to improper" all week.
**Option C** is the classic "add everything" error—adding numerators and denominators. It's very common among those who struggle with the concept of a common denominator.
**Option D** is a hybrid error: adding the whole numbers correctly but then adding the denominators as if they were numerators.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=45% D=25%
basic: A=55% B=15% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=4% C=0% D=0%
