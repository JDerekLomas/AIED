After marking hundreds of these, this is a classic "fraction fatigue" question. Even high-performing Year 9s can stumble because they see the 3 and the 12 and instinctively want to divide 12 by 3 to get 4, rather than dividing the fraction by 3.

**Teacher's breakdown of errors:**
*   **A ($p = 1/4$):** The most common mistake. Students see $3$ and $12$, know they need to "do something with the 3", and perform $12 \div 3 = 4$, then place it back in the denominator.
*   **C ($p = 4$):** Common for students who struggle with reciprocal operations. They multiply by 12 and divide by 3 (essentially treating the $1/12$ as just 12).
*   **D ($p = 1/9$):** A rare but specific error where students think they need to subtract or square/triple the denominator in some way, or mistype $3 \times 3$.
*   **B ($p = 1/36$):** The correct answer ($\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$). Requires understanding that "dividing by 3" is the same as "multiplying the denominator by 3".
