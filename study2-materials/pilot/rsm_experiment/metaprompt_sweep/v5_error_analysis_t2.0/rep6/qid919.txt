To predict the results for this question, I have analysed the following common pitfalls:
*   **The "Squaring Decimal" Trap (B vs D):** This is the primary hurdle. Many students correctly calculate $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$ and then multiply by 3 to get $0.27$ (Option B). However, a vast number of students (even those comfortable with algebra) intuitively think $0.3^2 = 0.9$. They then calculate $0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$ (Option D).
*   **Order of Operations (A):** Lower-ability students often multiply before squaring: $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$.
*   **The Linear Slip (C):** Students who ignore the square or misinterpret $x^2$ as $2x$ will calculate $3 \times (0.3 \times 2) = 1.8$.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=1% B=94% C=0% D=5%
