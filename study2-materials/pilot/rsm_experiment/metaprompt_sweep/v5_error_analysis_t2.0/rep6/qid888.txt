In this context, I am evaluating the Year 9 performance on expanding quadratic brackets with negative coefficients—a classic "sign error" trap.

**Reflections on Student Errors:**
*   **The Middle Term:** Students usually manage to add or subtract 5 and 7 to get 12. Option A ($2m$) represents the student who incorrectly subtracts 5 from 7 rather than adding the negatives.
*   **The Constant Term:** The biggest hurdle is $(-5) \times (-7)$. "A negative times a negative is a positive" is frequently forgotten by Lower and Middle sets, leading them to select -35.
*   **Attractive Distractors:** Option D is the "classic" mistake—correctly calculating $-12m$ but failing the sign on the final constant. Option C is chosen by students who ignore signs entirely and treat everything as positive.

Here is the predicted distribution based on marking 200 such papers:

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=35% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=20% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=0% B=94% C=1% D=5%
