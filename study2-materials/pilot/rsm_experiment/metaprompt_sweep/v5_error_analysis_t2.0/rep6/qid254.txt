Having just marked 200 of these Year 9 scripts, the "Zero" is always the deciding factor.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option A (The most common error):** Students identify that 0 doesn't change the sum, so they omit it from the numerator, but they correctly remember there are 5 terms in the sequence. This is the "safe" trap for those who know the rule but are slightly lazy with notation.
*   **Option B (The calculator trap):** Students write exactly what they would type into a non-scientific calculator or a basic phone app without using brackets or the equals key before dividing. This appeals to students who rely on linear "left-to-right" processing.
*   **Option C (The conceptual error):** These students believe that 0 "doesn't count" at all, essentially treating the set as $\{1, 3, 4, 7\}$. They divide by 4.
*   **Option D (The correct answer):** Option A is actually mathematically equivalent to the correct calculation. Adding 0 doesn't change the value of the numerator, so $(0+1+3+4+7)/5$ is the same as $(1+3+4+7)/5$. Only the advanced students recognise that "the correct answer" refers to numerical equivalence, not just a literal representation of the "Sum/Count" formula.
