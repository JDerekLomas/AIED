Having marked hundreds of these papers, here is the breakdown of how Year 9 students typically perform on this specific mixed-number addition.

**Teacher's Notes on Common Misconceptions:**
*   **The Trap (Option D):** This is the "classic" Year 9 error. Many students (even those who generally know what they are doing) see addition and instinctively add both the numerators AND the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$).
*   **The Misread (Option B):** This represents students who have been drilled to convert everything to improper fractions first. They reach $18/5$ and, in their rush, fail to read the final instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number.
*   **The Confusion (Option C):** Usually chosen by students who have no clear method; they add the numerators, add the denominators, and forget the whole numbers entirely.
*   **Success (Option A):** Straightforward for students who recognize the common denominator.

**Predicted Performance:**
