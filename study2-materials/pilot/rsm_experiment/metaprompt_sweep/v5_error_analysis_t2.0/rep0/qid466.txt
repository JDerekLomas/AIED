To arrive at these percentages, I've considered the following common Year 9 misconceptions:

*   **The Sign Trap:** Students often fixate on the numerical value and forget the product of two negatives is a positive. Many students see $-1$ and instinctively think they need another negative to "keep it negative," leading them to pick B.
*   **Reciprocal Confusion:** Lower-ability students often mistake the reciprocal ($4/3$) for the additive inverse or simply repeat the fraction given in the question (C or D). 
*   **Attractive Errors:** B is the most common "strong student" error—they know they need the reciprocal but over-correct the signs. A is only chosen consistently by students who correctly verify that $(-3/4) \times (4/3) = -12/12 = -1$.
