To predict these percentages, I have considered the following common misconceptions found in Year 9 scripts:

*   **Option A (0.81):** This is the result of calculating $(3x)^2$ rather than $3(x^2)$. Students multiply 3 by 0.3 to get 0.9, then square it. This is an incredibly common BIDMAS error where students "read" the equation from left to right.
*   **Option B (0.27):** This is the correct answer. It requires squaring 0.3 (0.09) and then multiplying by 3.
*   **Option C (1.8):** This results from doubling instead of squaring (calculating $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$) or mistakenly multiplying $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then doubling that.
*   **Option D (2.7):** This is a place value error. Students square 0.3 and get 0.9 (forgetting the second decimal place), then multiply by 3 to get 2.7. 

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=20% B=65% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=92% C=1% D=2%
