In this Year 9 mock, this question is a classic "sign-trap" and "operation-confusion" task. 

The common errors are:
- **-12 (Option D):** The student confuses power notation with multiplication ($ -3 \times 4 $) and ignores the rules for signs. This is extremely common for lower-ability students.
- **-81 (Option C):** This is the most "attractive" trap. The student correctly calculates $3^4 = 81$ but assumes that a negative input must result in a negative output, or they are mentally simulating a non-casio calculator that processes $-3^4$ as $-(3^4)$. Even some proficient students fall for this.
- **12 (Option B):** Confuses power with multiplication but loses the negative sign.
- **81 (Option A):** The correct answer.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on 200 papers:

basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
