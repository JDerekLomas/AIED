To predict the performance of 200 Year 9 students on this question, we must look at the cognitive load and common misconceptions regarding implicit linear equations.

**The "Trap" Analysis:**
*   **A (20):** A common "number grabber" error. Students see $4$, $2$, $10$, and $0$. They might think $4 + 2 + 10 + 4 = 20$ or perform $4 \times 5 = 20$. This is a guess for students overwhelmed by variables.
*   **B (3):** This is the result if a student mistakes the $x$ and $y$ values, or assumes a gradient relationship incorrectly (e.g., $10 - 4 - 3...$). More likely, it is a random selection when they can't balance the equation.
*   **C (5):** The "Gold Standard" misconception. Students substitute $x=0$, getting $4(0) + 2y = 10$, and correctly solve $2y=10$. This is the intended correct answer.
*   **D (2.5):** The "Divided by everything" error. Students see the $4$, ignore the $x=0$, and think they need to divide $10$ by $4$ instead of $2$. Or, they rearrange to $y = -2x + 5$ but divide the gradient by the constant.
