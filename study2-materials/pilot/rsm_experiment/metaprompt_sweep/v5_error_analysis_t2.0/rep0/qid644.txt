To determine these percentages, I have looked at three primary factors: 
1. **The Arithmetic vs. Operation confusion:** Many students in Year 9 still reflexively add numbers when they see them adjacent, leading to the "5" answers. 
2. **The Sign Rule:** The double negative is the classic "filter" for the proficient level. 
3. **The 'Magic' minus:** Below-basic students often assume that if a negative is present, the answer must stay negative.

**A (+4):** Correct application of $(-1) \times (-4)$.
**B (-4):** Correct multiplication, but failed to apply the negative $\times$ negative rule.
**C (+5):** Added the absolute values $(1+4)$ or confused rules ($ -1 -4$ somehow becoming positive).
**D (-5):** Incorrectly performed $(-1) - 4$ instead of multiplying. This is a very "attractive" trap for students who forget they are "expanding" (multiplying).

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
