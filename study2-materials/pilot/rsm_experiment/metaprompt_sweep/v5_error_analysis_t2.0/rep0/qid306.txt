Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on typical Year 9 mock exam data.

**Teacher's Marking Notes:**
*   **The "Reading Left to Right" Trap:** Below-basic and basic students tend to default to a linear processing of mathematics. This leads them toward Option A (incorrectly applying left-to-right logic to Problem Q).
*   **The BIDMAS Addition Trap:** The most common misconception in Year 9 for "Problem P" is that because the 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in BIDMAS, the addition *must* be performed first. This makes the **D** response incredibly attractive to proficient students who know their acronyms but don't understand the equal priority of addition/subtraction.
*   **Left-to-Right Tie-break:** Students who understand that addition and subtraction have equal priority should work left to right for Problem P ($4-5$ first).
