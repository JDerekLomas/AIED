Having marked hundreds of these papers, here is how the students typically perform on this specific question regarding the "invisible" zero.

**The Thinking Behind the Stats:**
*   **The Trap (C):** The most common conceptual error is students thinking that the digit "0" doesn't "count" as a piece of data. They add the numbers correctly but divide by 4.
*   **The BODMAS Trap (B):** This is highly "attractive" because it mirrors how a student would type it into a non-scientific calculator or a cheap phone calculator without pressing equals before dividing.
*   **The Correct Logic (A):** The 0 is omitted from the numerator because it adds nothing to the sum, but is included in the denominator (5) because it is a value in the set. Advanced students see this instantly; basic students find it suspicious.
*   **The Skeptic (D):** Usually chosen by students who believe the 0 *must* be physically written in the numerator (e.g., $(0+1+3+4+7)/5$) and conclude that because it's missing, the answer is "None".
