To predict these percentages, I’ve considered the following common Year 9 behaviours:
*   **The Trap:** Katie's method is the "natural" error. Students often want to "get rid of the fraction" first but forget that they must multiply *every* term (including the -5) by 3. Because $12 \times 3 = 36$ looks like a "clean" step, many see it as correct.
*   **Tom's Step:** This is the standard "SAMDOP" (Reverse BIDMAS) approach. Most students recognize adding 5 to both sides as the standard first step.
*   **The Confusion:** "Both" (Option C) is highly attractive to middle-ability students who have been taught that you *can* multiply first, but haven't fully mastered the distributive property (forgetting to multiply the 5).

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=23% D=2%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=4% D=1%
