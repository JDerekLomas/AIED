To predict these percentages, I have analysed the following common pitfalls for Year 9 students:

*   **Option C (3.3):** The "Attractive Distractor." Students correctly substitute $y = 0.5$ to get $10x - 3 = 30$, but then make a common algebraic error by **subtracting** 3 instead of adding it ($10x = 27$), leading to $2.7$. *Wait—recalculating:* If they do $10x = 33$, they get **3.3**. This is the most common error for students who understand substitution but struggle with inverse operations across the equals sign.
*   **Option D (2.7):** Similar to C, but the student subtracts the 3 ($10x = 30 - 3$).
*   **Option B (-4.25):** The "Calculation Scramble." Students mix up $x$ and $y$. They plug $0.5$ into $x$: $(10 \times 0.5) - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y \approx -4.16$. They often round this or get lost in the signs and pick the closest negative decimal.
*   **Option A (3.3):** The Correct Answer ($10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$). 

Note: Looking at the options provided, there is a discrepancy in standard test design (usually $3.3$ is the intended correct answer). If the intended answer is A ($4.25$), it suggests a different equation entirely. However, for $10x - 6y = 30$, when $y = 0.5$:
$10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$.

Assuming **C is the correct answer** based on the math provided:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=40% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%
