To predict the results for this question, I have focused on the common misconception involving the commutative property (or lack thereof) in division. 

For many **Basic** students, their mental model for solving equations is "combine the two numbers using whatever operation feels right." To them, $10 \div 5 = 2$, so they instinctively gravitate toward C. 

**Below Basic** students often associate equations with multiplication if they see "grouping" or they simply multiply the two visible digits ($10 \times 5$) resulting in 50. 

The **Proficient** students know the steps to rearrange ($10p = 5$), but many stumble at the final hurdle, performing $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$, making Option C the strongest distractor for this middle-tier group. Only **Advanced** students consistently identify that the dividend is smaller than the divisor.

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=40% D=5%
basic: A=15% B=25% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=35% B=10% C=53% D=2%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=5% D=0%
