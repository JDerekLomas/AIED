In this Year 9 mock, this question specifically tests two potential pitfalls: the multiplication of negative integers and the confusion between operations (multiplication vs. addition). 

**The Thought Process:**
*   **The Trap (C and D):** Weaker students often see two numbers and "combine" them. $-1 - 4 = -5$ or seeing $1$ and $4$ and thinking addition. This is incredibly common under exam pressure for **Below Basic** students who forget they are *expanding* (multiplying).
*   **The Sign Error (B):** This is the "proficient trap." Students know they must multiply $1 \times 4$, but their mastery of directed numbers is shaky. They see two minus signs and their brain tells them the answer must stay negative.
*   **Advanced Catch:** These students have internalized "minus times a minus equals a plus" and won't be distracted by the addition options.

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 mock papers:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=75% B=22% C=1% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
