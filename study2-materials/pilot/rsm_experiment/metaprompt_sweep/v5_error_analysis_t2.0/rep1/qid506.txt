After marking hundreds of these, I've noticed this specific question is a "fraction trap." Students see the numbers 3 and 12 and their brains immediately jump to the factor pair $(3, 4)$ without considering the operation required.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A ($1/4$):** The most common mistake. Students see $3$ and $12$ and simply divide $12$ by $3$. They ignore the fact that the $12$ is in the denominator. This is a classic "number association" error.
*   **B (Correct):** To solve $3p = 1/12$, you must divide both sides by $3$ (or multiply by $1/3$). This gives $1/36$. 
*   **C ($4$):** These students "flip" the fraction to $12$ and then divide by $3$, or they simply multiply $3$ and $12$ and somehow think the answer is a whole number.
*   **D ($1/9$):** A rarer error where students square the $3$ or confuse the coefficient with a denominator ($3^2$ or similar).
