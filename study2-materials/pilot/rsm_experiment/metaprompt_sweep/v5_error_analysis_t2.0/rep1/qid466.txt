To reach the product of $-1$, the missing value must be the **reciprocal** of the original fraction. However, students frequently struggle with the "double negative" rule.

**The Logic behind the errors:**
*   **Option A (4/3):** The most common mistake. Students correctly identify that they need to "flip" the fraction to get a value of 1, but they apply the "opposite sign" rule as if they were looking for a sum of zero, or they simply forget that a negative times a positive is still a negative.
*   **Option C (3/4):** Common among lower-ability students who believe "multiplied by its positive version" makes it negative.
*   **Option D (-3/4):** A common confusion between the identity for multiplication and the rule for $(-1) \times (-1) = 1$. They see the answer is $-1$ and think "multiplying it by itself" is the shortcut.
