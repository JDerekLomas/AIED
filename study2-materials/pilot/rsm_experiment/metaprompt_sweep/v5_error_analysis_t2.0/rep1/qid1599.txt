To predict these percentages, I am considering the following common pitfalls for Year 9 students:
*   **The Dividend/Divisor Swap (D):** This is a very common error for students who understand that a fraction bar means divide, but habitually put the "larger-looking" expression or the second term on top.
*   **The Order of Operations/Bracket Neglect (C):** Students who view algebra as a left-to-right reading exercise often ignore the grouping effect of the bracket, leading them to think the $+4$ is separate from the division.
*   **Visual Similarity (B):** This is a classic "clutching at straws" error for those who see $c$, $h$, and $4$ and pick the option that contains the most components from the question, or misread the initial $c \div$.
*   **The Trap for "Proficient" students:** Even those who are comfortable with algebra can lose a mark to Option D if they are rushing and haven't mastered the specific discipline of "numerator first."

Here is the predicted distribution based on marking a typical 200-student Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=5% C=20% D=30%
proficient: A=80% B=2% C=8% D=10%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
