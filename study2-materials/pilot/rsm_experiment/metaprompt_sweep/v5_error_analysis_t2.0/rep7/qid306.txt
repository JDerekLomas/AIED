To predict these percentages, I’ve drawn on the common Year 9 misconceptions regarding BIDMAS/BODMAS.

**The Logic Behind the Traps:**
*   **Problem P (The "Addition First" Trap):** Many students take the "A" before "S" in BIDMAS literally. They see $5+6$ and think they must do that first, often resulting in $4-11=-7$. Students who understand that addition and subtraction have equal priority (working left to right) will correctly choose $4-5$.
*   **Problem Q (The Left-to-Right Trap):** This is the classic order of operations error. Lower-ability students instinctively work left to right regardless of the operators, calculating $4+5$ first.
*   **"B" is the correct answer:** It requires understanding left-to-right priority for P and operator hierarchy for Q.

**The Predicted Breakdown:**

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=45% D=30%
*(Note: These students often over-rely on the 'A comes before S' rule for P, and work left-to-right for Q. Option C is the most common magnet here.)*

basic: A=10% B=45% C=25% D=20%
*(Note: At this level, many have mastered the 'Multiply before Add' rule for Q, but still fall for the 'Addition before Subtraction' trap in P, leading them to D.)*

proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
*(Note: Most have cleared the hurdle of BIDMAS priority. The remaining errors are usually over-thinking the addition priority in P.)*

advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
*(Note: High-fliers almost always recognise that + and - are co-equal. Errors here are usually due to rushing or misreading the question.)*
