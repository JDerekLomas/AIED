After marking 200 of these, the patterns are very clear. 

The biggest pitfall is the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number." Students who find the correct value but express it as an improper fraction (B) lose the mark, a classic "low-hanging fruit" error for middle-attaining students. 

The "add everything" error leads to option D, where students add the whole numbers, the numerators, AND the denominators ($5+5=10$). This is incredibly common for below-basic students who lack a conceptual understanding of what a denominator represents. Option C represents the "all-out panic" error, where they convert to improper fractions but still add the denominators ($11/5 + 7/5 = 18/10$).

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=5% C=25% D=50%
basic: A=55% B=15% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
