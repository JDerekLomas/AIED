To predict the outcome for this Year 9 mock, we have to look at how students handle two-step linear equations with negative signs and decimals.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A (3.3):** The "Common Addition" error. Students substitute $y = 0.5$ to get $10x - 3 = 30$. They then incorrectly subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding (getting 27) or make a division error. However, $3.3$ is more commonly reached by students who rearrange to $10x = 30 + 3$, getting $33$, then dividing by 10. **This is the correct answer.**
*   **B (2.7):** The "Sign Error" trap. Students calculate $6 \times 0.5 = 3$, but they see the minus sign and think "subtract 3 from 30". $10x = 30 - 3 = 27$, so $x = 2.7$. This is an extremely common mistake for students who aren't confident with inverse operations.
*   **C (4.25):** The "Substitution Flip" error. Some students swap $x$ and $y$. They put $x = 0.5$ into the equation: $5 - 6y = 30 \rightarrow -6y = 25 \rightarrow y \approx -4.16$. However, some simply do $(30 + 10 \times 0.5) \div 6 = 35 \div 6 \approx 5.8$ or variations. More commonly, $4.25$ is a distractor for those who add $30 + 6 + 0.5 \dots$ and get lost in arithmetic.
*   **D (-4.25):** The "Lost in Negatives" error. Often chosen by students who see a negative in the original equation and feel the answer "should be negative."
