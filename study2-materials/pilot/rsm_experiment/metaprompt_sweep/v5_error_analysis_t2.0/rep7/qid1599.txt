In marking this particular question across 200 scripts, the most common pitfall is not the concept of a fraction as division, but rather the **direction of the operation** and the **placement of terms within the expression**.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A (Correct):** Shows understanding that the entire expression following the $\div$ sign serves as the denominator.
*   **B (Miscopying/Over-generalisation):** Students see the "$+4$" at the end and feel it needs to be "balanced" or distributed across the numerator. This is an "attractive" error for students who have just learned about adding fractions but haven't mastered algebraic notation.
*   **C (Order of Operations Error):** Students who think from left to right and ignore the importance of the bracket, essentially calculating $(c \div h) + 4$. This is a very common Year 9 error.
*   **D (Inverse Error):** The "division is a fraction" rule is remembered, but the order is swapped. This is the most common error for middle-ability students who rush.

Here are the predicted percentages based on typical Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=55% B=10% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=3% D=10%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
