In this Year 9 mock, students find the implicit form ($4x+2y=10$) much more difficult than the standard $y=mx+c$. Even with $x=0$, the "2y" term causes significant friction.

*   **Option C (5)** is the correct answer.
*   **Option B (3)** is the "natural trap": students correctly identify $x=0$ leaves $2y=10$, but then mistakenly subtract 2 instead of dividing by 2 ($10-2=8$, not an option, so they guess a number that looks right or confuse it with the next $y$-value in a sequence). Alternatively, they think $4+2+y=10$, so $y=4$, or simply guess 3 because they expect a small integer sequence.
*   **Option A (20)** is for those who multiply 4 by 0 correctly, but then multiply 10 by 2 (or think $y=10 \times 2$). 
*   **Option D (2.5)** comes from dividing 10 by 4, effectively solving for $x$ if $y$ were 0, or confusing the coefficients.

**Student Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many see the number 4 and 10 and try to multiply/add them. Some skip the 0 entirely.
*   **Basic:** They know $x=0$ means $4 \times 0$ disappears, but struggle with $2y=10$. They often subtract 2 or pick B (3) because it "looks" like it belongs in a pattern.
*   **Proficient:** Generally handle the substitution but 10-15% will forget to divide by 2 or make a silly arithmetic slip.
*   **Advanced:** Usually spot the $x=0$ shortcut immediately.
