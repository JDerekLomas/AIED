In Year 9, "order of operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS) remains a persistent hurdle. After marking 200 of these, the patterns are predictable: 

**Option A (6)** is the correct answer $(4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 + 8 = 6)$. Even students who remember BIDMAS often trip on the final addition/subtraction, erroneously thinking Addition must happen before Subtraction $(3 - 13 = -10)$, leading them elsewhere.

**Option B (4)** comes from the most common Year 9 mistake: moving strictly left-to-right $(3-5 = -2$, then $-2+4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4)$. This "feels" natural to students who treat maths like reading a sentence.

**Option C (-12)** is a variation of the left-to-right error but with a sign mistake, or sometimes adding the 5 and 4 first then multiplying $(3 - 9 \times 2)$.

**Option D (-10)** is the "false BIDMAS" trap. Students remember they must do Multiplication first $(8)$ and Addition second $(5+8=13)$, resulting in $3-13$. This is a very "attractive" error for mid-level students who have learned the acronym but not the "left-to-right" rule for equal priority operations.
