Having just sat at my kitchen table for eight hours marking 200 of these, I can tell you that this question is a "wolf in sheep's clothing." At first glance, it looks like simple one-step algebra, but the presence of the fraction on the right-hand side triggers what I call "operational confusion."

**The Trap Analysis:**
*   **A ($p = 1/4$):** This is the most "attractive" error. Students see 3 and 12 and immediately think $12 \div 3$. They lose track of the fact that 12 is in the denominator. They essentially solve $3p = 12$ but keep the 1 on top, or they try to multiply by 3 instead of dividing.
*   **B ($p = 1/36$):** The correct answer. Requires the student to multiply both sides by $1/3$ or recognize they are dividing a fraction by an integer ($\frac{1}{12} \div 3$).
*   **C ($p = 4$):** Common for students with very low algebraic fluency. They ignore the fraction bar entirely and treat it as $3p = 12$, or they multiply 12 by $1/3$ but forget it was a denominator.
*   **D ($p = 1/9$):** A "distractor by proximity." Students might try to subtract 3 from 12 because they are confused about inverse operations, or they misidentify the relationship between the numbers.

Here is the predicted breakdown of my mark book:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=94% C=0% D=1%
