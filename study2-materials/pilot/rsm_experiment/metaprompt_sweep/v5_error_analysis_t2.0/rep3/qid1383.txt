In my experience marking this specific topic with Year 9 students, the "negative base" rule is a notorious differentiator. Even higher-ability students can be tripped up by their own calculators if they don't use brackets correctly, but at the "Advanced" level, the familiarity with the pattern of $(-1)^{even} = positive$ usually wins out.

Here is the breakdown of how these 200 papers usually look:

**The rationale behind the errors:**
*   **B & D (12 / -12):** These students are performing the common misconception of multiplying the base by the index ($3 \times 4 = 12$). This is rampant in the lower tiers.
*   **C (-81):** This is the most "attractive" trap. It comes from two places: (1) thinking that a negative input must produce a negative output, and (2) entering `-3^4` into a scientific calculator without brackets, which follows BIDMAS/BODMAS by doing $3^4$ first and then applying the negative.
*   **A (81):** The correct answer.
