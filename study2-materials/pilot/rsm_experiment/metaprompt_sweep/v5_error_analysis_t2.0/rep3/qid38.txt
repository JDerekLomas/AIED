To simplify $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, the correct method is to find a common denominator ($2x$). Multiplying the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$ gives $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$ (Option A).

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** The classic "add across" error. Students add the numerators ($3+4$) and the denominators ($2x+x$). This is extremely common for lower-ability students who treat fractions as two separate sets of addition.
*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** Students recognise they need a common denominator but forget to adjust the numerator. They change $\frac{4}{x}$ to $\frac{4}{2x}$ and then add $3+4$.
*   **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** A less common "halfway" error where the student correctly gets 11 but somehow loses the 2 in the denominator through a misunderstood simplification or by attempting to multiply the whole expression by 2 as if solving an equation.
