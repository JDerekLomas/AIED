After marking 200 of these, I can tell you that this specific question is a classic "trapping" question. 

Many students at the lower end see the "correct" looking multiplication in Step 1 and then intuitively feel that adding 1 to 60 (to get 61) "feels" right because they see a subtraction sign in their mind's eye or simply inverse the wrong way. The most common error is Step 2, where students do $60 + 1$ instead of $60 - 1$. 

Higher-ability students spot that $61-1$ would be 60, but $1+61$ is 62, catching the sign error in Step 2 immediately.

Below is the predicted percentage breakdown based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=65% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=5% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=5% D=2%
