In this context, I am evaluating the Year 9 performance on the expansion of $(m-5)(m-7)$. This is a classic "signs trap" question.

**Diagnostic Teacher Notes:**
*   **The "-2 Error" (Option A):** Common for students who think $(-5) + (-7)$ means finding the difference between the two numbers (essentially $7 - 5 = 2$) rather than moving further left on the number line.
*   **The "+12 Error" (Option C):** Very common for students who know they must "combine 5 and 7" but ignore the signs entirely, or who think that because the last term is positive ($+35$), the middle term must also be positive.
*   **The Final Term Error (Option D):** This is the most common error among "Basic" students. They correctly sum $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12m$, but their knowledge of the rule "a negative times a negative is a positive" is shaky or forgotten in the heat of the exam.
*   **Target (Option B):** The correct application of FOIL or the grid method, correctly handling $-5 \times -7 = +35$ and $-5 - 7 = -12$.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%
