Having marked hundreds of these papers, here is the breakdown based on typical Year 9 misconceptions.

The presence of the number **0** is the primary "distractor" here. Many students at lower ability levels feel that zero "doesn't count" and will attempt to exclude it from the count of items (Option C). Others will recognize it needs to be included in the division but forget to write it in the numerator (Option A). Option B is the "calculator trap"—students often write or type exactly that sequence without brackets, forgetting BIDMAS/order of operations.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=5%
*Lower ability students often ignore the zero entirely (C) or write the expression as a linear string (B) without realizing it only divides the final number by 5.*

basic: A=35% B=25% C=30% D=10%
*This group knows they must divide by 5, but they often see Option A as "correct enough" because adding zero doesn't change the sum. They struggle to realize that mathematically, A is the only valid expression for the mean here.*

proficient: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
*Proficient students identify that 0 is part of the dataset (dividing by 5) and recognize that \(0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7\) is equal to \(1 + 3 + 4 + 7\). They usually spot the BIDMAS error in B.*

advanced: A=92% B=2% C=1% D=5%
*High-ability students see the equivalence immediately. The 5% choosing D are often "over-thinkers" who might argue that because the 0 isn't explicitly written in the numerator of A, the expression is "incomplete," despite it being mathematically correct.*

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=05%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=92% B=02% C=01% D=05%
