To a Year 9 student, "Order of Operations" often presents two distinct psychological hurdles: the strict hierarchy of BIDMAS/BODMAS and the common misconception that "Addition comes before Subtraction" because 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym.

In **Problem P**, lower-ability students fixate on the 'A' before 'S' rule, incorrectly believing they must do $5+6$ first (Option D). Stronger students know that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and are solved left-to-right. 
In **Problem Q**, the trap is simply reading left-to-right and adding $4+5$ before multiplying. This is the "low-hanging fruit" error that even intermediate students fall for when rushing.

**Option B** is the mathematically correct path ($4-5$ first due to left-to-right; $5 \times 6$ first due to Multiplication priority).

**Prediction of Results:**

**below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=30% D=45%**
*(The majority here see the '+' in Problem P and apply BIDMAS literally, thinking Addition *must* happen before Subtraction. They also read Q left-to-right. Option D is the "ultra-literal" BIDMAS error.)*

**basic: A=10% B=25% C=20% D=45%**
*(Students at this level are still heavily prone to the $5+6$ trap in Problem P. They are beginning to remember that multiplication comes first in Problem Q, but many still pick D over B.)*

**proficient: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%**
*(These students have mastered the multiplication priority in Problem Q. However, roughly a third of this cohort will still get tricked by Problem P, insisting that the 'A' in BIDMAS means they cannot do $4-5$ first.)*

**advanced: A=0% B=92% C=0% D=8%**
*(Advanced students know Addition/Subtraction are left-to-right. Only a small percentage will make a "silly" slip or overthink the BIDMAS acronym to the point of choosing D.)*
