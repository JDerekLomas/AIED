In this Year 9 mock, students frequently trip up on the distinction between adding and multiplying directed numbers. The "attractive" trap here is the additive error (-1 and -4 makes -5), which often persists in the lower sets.

*   **Error for B (-4):** Ignoring the negative sign on the 1 or applying the "one negative makes the answer negative" rule incorrectly.
*   **Error for C (+5):** Identifying that two negatives make a plus, but then adding the numbers (1 + 4).
*   **Error for D (-5):** Performing addition (-1 - 4) instead of multiplication. This is the most common conceptual error for students who see "expanding" as a series of number manipulations but forget the operation.

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 papers:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=10% D=45%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
