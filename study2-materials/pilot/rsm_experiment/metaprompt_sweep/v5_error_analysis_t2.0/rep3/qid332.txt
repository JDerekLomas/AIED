To predict the results for this Year 9 question, we have to consider the common misconceptions regarding the order of operations when rearranging equations.

**The Thinking Behind the Predictions:**

*   **Tom's Method (Correct):** Adding 5 to both sides is the standard first step taught in UK schools. It's the "flowchart" method most students are comfortable with.
*   **Katie's Method (Incorrect):** This is a very "attractive" error. Students often know they need to "multiply by 3" to remove the fraction, but they frequently forget to multiply *every* term on the left-hand side (failing to distribute the 3 to the -5). This leads them to think \(x - 5 = 36\) is valid.
*   **The Trap:** Because Katie's result ($36$) looks "clean" and stems from a recognisable operation ($12 \times 3$), many students will believe both are valid paths, leading to a high percentage of **C** answers.

**Predicted Percentages:**

**below_basic:** A=25% B=20% C=45% D=10%
*(These students often guess or choose C because "they both look like they're doing something mathsy." Many struggle with inverse operations entirely.)*

**basic:** A=40% B=15% C=40% D=5%
*(At this level, students recognize Tom's move as 'correct' but are highly susceptible to Katie's trap, assuming that you can just "move" the 3 to the other side without affecting the -5.)*

**proficient:** A=65% B=5% C=28% D=2%
*(Most proficient Year 9s know to add 5 first. However, a significant minority will still be tricked by Katie's logic because $12 \times 3 = 36$ feels like a 'correct' step in isolation.)*

**advanced:** A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%
*(Advanced students will immediately spot that Katie failed to multiply the -5 by 3. They understand that $x-15=36$ would have been correct, making Katie's statement false.)*
