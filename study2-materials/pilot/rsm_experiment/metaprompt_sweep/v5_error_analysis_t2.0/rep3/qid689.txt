Having marked 200 of these, I’ve seen these exact pitfalls today. 

The primary trap here is the "commutable division" fallacy—students see a 10 and a 5 and reflexively perform $10 \div 5$ because they are conditioned to divide the larger number by the smaller one. **Option C** is the ultimate "attractive nuisance." 

Even "basic" students who remember they need to multiply $p$ up often stop at $10p = 5$ and then mistakenly conclude that $10 \div 5$ is the next step rather than $5 \div 10$. **Option B** is for the students who see a fraction and simply "do the opposite" by multiplying the two integers shown ($10 \times 5$), showing no understanding of the variable's position.

Here is the breakdown of the predictions based on those scripts:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=40% D=5%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=38% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
