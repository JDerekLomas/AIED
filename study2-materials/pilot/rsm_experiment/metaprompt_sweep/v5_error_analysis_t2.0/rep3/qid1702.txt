To predict the performance of Year 9 students on this question, we must look at the specific algebraic pitfalls. The correct calculation is: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, so $x = 3.3$ **(Option C)**.

The primary traps are:
1.  **The Addition/Subtraction Error (A):** Students do $10x = 30 - 3$ instead of $30 + 3$. This gives $27 / 10 = 2.7$ **(D)**. However, many students perform the calculation $10x = 30 + (6 \times 0.5)$, but then somehow confuse the sign later or attempt to use the "move and change" rule incorrectly with the multiplier, or calculate $(30 + 12.5)/10$ if they think the $y$ value is actually $x$.
2.  **The Inverse Error (D):** This is the most common distractor for mid-to-low ability. They successfully substitute but subtract 3 from 30 rather than adding it.
3.  **The Sign Swap (B):** This attracts students who think the answer must be negative because the original equation has a minus sign, or they get tangled in "balancing" the sides.
4.  **Misinterpreting the Table:** Lower ability students often swap $x$ and $y$ or think $0.5$ is a multiplier for the $x$.

Here is the predicted distribution based on typical Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=35% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=75% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%
