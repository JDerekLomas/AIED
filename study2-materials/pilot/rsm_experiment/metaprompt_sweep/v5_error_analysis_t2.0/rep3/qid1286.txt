In this Year 9 mock, students find the rearrangement of the sphere formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) notoriously difficult because it involves three distinct steps: moving the fraction, dividing by $\pi$, and applying the cube root.

*   **Option C (The Correct Answer):** Requires the steps in the correct order: multiply by 3, divide by $4\pi$.
*   **Option A:** A very common "lazy" rearrangement where the student keeps the $4\pi/3$ intact but moves it to the other side without reciprocating. It "looks" right because all components are there.
*   **Option B:** An error in grouping; the student correctly moves the $\pi$ and the 4 to the denominator but forgets that the 3 must move to the numerator.
*   **Option D:** Usually chosen by students who try to cube root before rearranging, or simply guess because it looks "mathsy" without following algebraic logic.
