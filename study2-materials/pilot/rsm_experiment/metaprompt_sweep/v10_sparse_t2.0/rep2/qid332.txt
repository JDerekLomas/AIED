As a UK maths teacher, I would categorize these levels based on typical GCSE performance (Grades 1-9). This specific question tests **Order of Operations in Reverse (SAMDOB/BIDMAS)** and the ability to maintain equality through inverse operations.

Here is the prediction of student responses:

### **Predicted Responses**

| Ability Level | A (Tom) | B (Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** (Grade 1-2) | **55%** | 15% | 10% | 20% |
| **Basic** (Grade 3-4) | **65%** | 10% | 15% | 10% |
| **Proficient** (Grade 5-6) | **82%** | 3% | 12% | 3% |
| **Advanced** (Grade 7-9) | **96%** | 0% | 4% | 0% |

### **Teacher’s Commentary & Misconception Analysis**

**Correct Answer: A (Only Tom)**
*   **Tom** is correct because he applied the inverse of $-5$ ($+5$) to both sides first.
*   **Katie** is incorrect because she only multiplied the term $\frac{x}{3}$ and the $12$ by 3, forgetting to multiply the $-5$. If she wanted to multiply by 3 first, her line should have been $x - 15 = 36$.

#### **Below Basic**
Students at this level often guess based on "looks right." Many will pick **A** because adding 5 to 12 feels like the "natural" first step. However, a significant number will pick **D** because they find fractions intimidating and assume neither person knows what they are doing. Some may pick **B** simply because they see "multiply by 3" and see that $12 \times 3 = 36$, ignoring the structure of the equation.

#### **Basic**
These students have been drilled in "do the same to both sides." Most will recognize Tom's method ($+5$ to both sides) as the standard way they were taught. The 15% who choose **C** do so because they have a vague memory that "you can multiply to get rid of a fraction," and they don't look closely enough at the $-5$ to realise it wasn't multiplied.

#### **Proficient**
Most students here are fluent in two-step equations. The minority who choose **C** are often "over-confident" students who work too quickly. They see Katie multiplied the 3 and the 12 and assume she is using an alternative valid method (which it would be, had she distributed the 3 to the 5).

#### **Advanced**
These students almost universally choose **A**. They have high algebraic fluently and immediately spot the "distributive law" error in Katie’s working. The tiny percentage choosing **C** usually comes from students who misread the question as "Who has the correct final answer?" and mistakenly think Katie’s line would eventually lead to the right result.
