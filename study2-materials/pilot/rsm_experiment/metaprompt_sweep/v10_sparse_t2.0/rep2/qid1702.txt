As a UK maths teacher, I would analyse this question based on GCSE foundation and higher tier expectations. The core challenge here is a multi-step algebraic substitution involving a decimal and a negative coefficient for $y$, which is a common "stumbling block" for students.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic (Working at Grade 1–2)**
*Focus: Intuition, basic arithmetic errors, and difficulty with the negative sign.*
*   **A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%**
*   **Why:** Many students at this level will perform $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, correctly get $10x - 3 = 30$, but then mistakenly **subtract** 3 instead of adding it ($10x = 27 \Rightarrow x = 2.7$), leading to **D**. Others will simply guess or attempt to add $6 + 0.5$, resulting in nonsensical answers. **A** is the most popular "blind guess" because it looks like a calculated number.

**basic (Working at Grade 3–4)**
*Focus: Methodical substitution but prone to signs and inverse operation errors.*
*   **A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%**
*   **Why:** These students know to substitute $0.5$ for $y$. However, the calculation $10x - 3 = 30$ often becomes $10x = 33$ (leading to **C**—a common "clean" decimal mistake) or $10x = 27$ (leading to **D**). They often choose **A** because they "over-adjust" for the decimal and assume the answer must be more complex than 3.3.

**proficient (Working at Grade 5–6)**
*Focus: Stronger algebraic manipulation, mostly correct arithmetic.*
*   **A=10% B=5% C=75% D=10%**
*   **Why:** Students at this level usually follow the correct process: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$. Errors usually occur if they misread the question as $x = 0.5$ instead of $y = 0.5$.

**advanced (Working at Grade 7–9)**
*Focus: Fluency and verification.*
*   **A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%**
*   **Why:** High-attaining students will treat this as a "quick mark." They will solve it mentally or with minimal working and likely double-check by substituting 3.3 back into the equation.

### Summary Table

| Ability Level | A (4.25) | B (-4.25) | C (3.3) | D (2.7) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **below_basic** | 40% | 10% | 30% | 20% |
| **basic** | 35% | 15% | 25% | 25% |
| **proficient** | 10% | 5% | 75% | 10% |
| **advanced** | 1% | 1% | 97% | 1% |

**The Correct Answer is C.**
1. Substitute $y = 0.5$: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
2. Simplify: $10x - 3 = 30$
3. Rearrange: $10x = 33$
4. Solve: $x = 3.3$
