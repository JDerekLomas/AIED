Here are the predicted response distributions based on standard UK Key Stage 3 and GCSE performance data.

The question tests the ability to substitute $x=0$ into a linear equation ($4x + 2y = 10$) and solve for $y$.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic:** A=40% B=15% C=35% D=10%
*   **Reasoning:** These students often struggle with the structure of equations. A significant number will choose **A (20)** because they multiply the numbers they see ($4 \times 5 = 20$ or $10 \times 2 = 20$) or incorrectly process the "4x" and "2y" alongside the 10. Many choose **C (5)** as a "common sense" guess because it is half of 10, or they successfully eliminate $4x$ but then simply look at the $10$.

**basic:** A=15% B=20% C=55% D=10%
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level understand they need to substitute $x=0$. They correctly identify that $4(0) = 0$. However, a common error is failing to perform the final division; they see $2y = 10$ and some mistakenly select **B (3)** through poor arithmetic, but the majority successfully reach **C (5)**.

**proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** Most students at this level (roughly Grade 4/5 GCSE) will substitute $x=0$ correctly to get $0 + 2y = 10$. They are comfortable with one-step equations and will correctly divide by 2 to reach $y = 5$. Errors here are usually due to "exam fog" or misreading the question.

**advanced:** A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%
*   **Reasoning:** For higher-tier students, this is a "rebound" mark. Substitution and basic linear rearrangement are foundational skills. The only errors would be extreme carelessness or bubbling the wrong letter on a grid.

### Analysis of Distractors
*   **A (20):** Created by multiplying $4 \times 5$ (anticipating $y$) or doubling 10. Common for students who "word-match" numbers without algebraic logic.
*   **B (3):** Often a result of a subtraction error ($10 - 4 - 3$ type logic) or a guess.
*   **C (5):** **Correct Answer.** Result of $2y = 10$.
*   **D (2.5):** Results from students who confuse the coefficients and divide $10$ by $4$ instead of $2$.
