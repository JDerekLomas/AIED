In the context of the UK curriculum (GCSE Higher Tier), this question tests **subject rearrangement** and recall of the **sphere volume formula** ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$). 

Common errors include inverted fractions during division, forgetting that $\pi$ is in the numerator, and incorrectly applying the cube root to only part of the expression.

**below_basic:** (Grade 3/Lower 4) Students at this level often struggle to recall the formula or panic when seeing $V$ as a variable instead of a number. They are likely to guess based on visual familiarity or "standard" fraction looks.
**basic:** (Grade 5) These students usually know the formula but make algebraic slips. Many will divide by 3 and multiply by 4 (inverting the $\frac{4}{3}$ incorrectly) or lose $\pi$ in the process.
**proficient:** (Grade 7) These students are confident in rearranging but may still fall for the "visual trap" of Option B if they don't carefully write out the steps of dividing by $\frac{4}{3}\pi$.
**advanced:** (Grade 8/9) These students perform the multi-step rearrangement ($3V = 4\pi r^3 \rightarrow \frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$) mentally and recognize the cube root must encompass the entire fraction.
