Here are the predicted response percentages for UK Year 9/10 students, based on common misconceptions encountered in the GCSE foundation and higher tiers.

**below_basic (Working towards Grade 1-2)**
*   **Likely error:** High percentage choosing A. Students at this level often treat $-5$ and $-7$ as terms to be added/subtracted directly (e.g., $-7 - (-5)$ or $7 - 5 = 2$) rather than knowing to sum them for the middle term. They also frequently struggle with the "negative x negative = positive" rule for the final constant.
*   **A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%**

**basic (Grade 3-4)**
*   **Likely error:** High percentage choosing D or C. These students know the FOIL/Grid method and correctly sum $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12m$. However, they often falter on the final step $(-5 \times -7)$, either getting the sign wrong (D) or assuming that because the brackets have minuses, the answer must be "all plus" (C).
*   **A=15% B=35% C=20% D=30%**

**proficient (Grade 5-6)**
*   **Likely error:** Small percentage choosing D. Students here are comfortable with expanding brackets but can make a "slip" under timed conditions, specifically with the signs of the final term. They are generally reliable with the linear term ($ -12m $).
*   **A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%**

**advanced (Grade 7+)**
*   **Likely error:** Negligible. These students recognize the pattern immediately. If they get it wrong, it is usually a recording error or misreading the letters.
*   **A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%**

### Teacher Analysis of Distractors:
*   **A ($m^2-2m-35$):** The "Difference" error. Student added 5 and -7 or found the difference between 5 and 7 for the middle term.
*   **B (Correct):** Correct application of $(-5) + (-7) = -12$ and $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$.
*   **C ($m^2+12m+35$):** The "Sign Ignore" error. Student ignored the negative signs within the brackets and treated it as $(m+5)(m+7)$.
*   **D ($m^2-12m-35$):** The "Negative Constant" error. Student correctly identified $-12m$ but failed to multiply the two negatives to reach $+35$. This is the most common "higher-level" mistake.
