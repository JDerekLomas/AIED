As a UK maths teacher, I would categorize these levels based on typical GCSE performance (Foundation vs Higher) and the common misconceptions surrounding directed numbers and the distributive law (FOIL/Grid method).

The main "distractors" here are:
*   **Sign error (B):** Forgetting that a negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive.
*   **Operation error (C/D):** Adding the terms ($-1 - 4 = -5$ or similar) instead of multiplying them.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses:

### **below_basic (Working at Grade 1/2)**
*These students often struggle to distinguish between the rules for addition and multiplication of directed numbers. Many will see "1 and 4" and default to addition.*
*   **A (+4):** 20%
*   **B (-4):** 25%
*   **C (+5):** 15%
*   **D (-5):** 40%
*(The most common error here is D, treating it as -1 + -4).*

### **basic (Working at Grade 3/4)**
*These students know that "expanding brackets" involves multiplication, but their grasp of negative number rules is shaky. They are likely to perform the multiplication but fail the sign check.*
*   **A (+4):** 35%
*   **B (-4):** 45%
*   **C (+5):** 5%
*   **D (-5):** 15%
*(B is the "dominant" wrong answer here; they do $1 \times 4 = 4$ and assume it stays negative because they see minus signs.)*

### **proficient (Working at Grade 5/6)**
*These students are fluent in the process of FOIL or the Grid Method. The majority will correctly identify that a negative times a negative is a positive, though a few will make a "rushed" sign error.*
*   **A (+4):** 80%
*   **B (-4):** 15%
*   **C (+5):** 2%
*   **D (-5):** 3%
*(The majority get the correct answer, with B being the only significant distractor due to exam pressure/speed).*

### **advanced (Working at Grade 7+)**
*At this level, students see the constant term multiplication as a trivial sub-step. Errors are extremely rare.*
*   **A (+4):** 96%
*   **B (-4):** 3%
*   **C (+5):** 0%
*   **D (-5):** 1%
*(Almost all will select A; a tiny percentage might misclick B if it's a digital test or a "brain fade").*
