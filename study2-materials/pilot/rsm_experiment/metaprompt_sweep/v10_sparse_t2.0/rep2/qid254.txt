As a UK maths teacher, I would expect to see the following distribution. The "trap" here is the presence of the **zero**. Students often struggle with whether to include zero in the sum (numerator) or the count (denominator).

**Teacher’s Analysis:**
*   **The Trap (A vs. C):** Does the 0 count as a value? Weakest students ignore it entirely (C). Mid-level students include it in the count but think it doesn't need to be in the sum (A).
*   **The Calculator Error (B):** This tests knowledge of BODMAS/Order of Operations. Without brackets, this calculation would only divide the 7 by 5.
*   **The Correct Answer (D):** The correct calculation is $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$ or $(0+1+3+4+7)\div 5$. Because "0" is missing from the numerator in A, and brackets are missing in B, D is technically the only correct choice.

**below_basic:** A=30% B=25% C=40% D=5%
*   *Rationale:* These students often have the "count only the numbers you can see that aren't zero" misconception. They will gravitate heavily toward **C**. Many will also pick **B** because it looks like a standard horizontal sum they would type into a basic calculator.

**basic:** A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%
*   *Rationale:* Students at this level know there are 5 numbers, so they usually reject C. However, many believe that because adding 0 doesn't change the total, Option **A** is mathematically identical to the "correct" way. They rarely spot the technicality required for D.

**proficient:** A=55% B=5% C=5% D=35%
*   *Rationale:* Most will lean toward **A** because, numerically, it gives the correct final value (15/5 = 3). However, the "Higher" tier students will start to question if Option A is a "complete" representation of the mean. This group is split between the "it works" crowd and the "it's not formal enough" crowd.

**advanced:** A=15% B=0% C=0% D=85%
*   *Rationale:* Advanced students (targeting Grade 8/9) are trained to be pedantic. They will instantly recognize that **B** is wrong due to BODMAS and that **A** is technically an incomplete expression of the mean formula, even if the sum is the same. They will choose **D** and be able to justify exactly why the other expressions are structurally flawed.
