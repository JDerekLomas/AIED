In the UK secondary curriculum, this question targets **KS3/KS4 Algebra (solving linear equations)**.

The error in Step 2 is a classic "inverse operation" confusion. Isaac should have subtracted 1 ($60 - 1 = 59$) but instead added it ($60 + 1 = 61$).

Here is the predicted distribution of student responses by ability level:

**below_basic:** A=25% B=15% C=50% D=10%
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level often perceive any "mathematical looking" work as correct. Many will see the $15 \times 4 = 60$ and the appearance of $61$ and assume because the numbers "feel" related, both must be right (Option C). Others may guess randomly.

**basic:** A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** These students usually recognize Step 1 is correct (multiplying by the denominator). However, a high percentage will fall for the "operator fatigue" trap in Step 2. They see $60$ and $1$, and their brain automatically completes the addition to get $61$ without checking if "adding 1" is the correct inverse of "+1".

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** Most students at this level have mastered one-step and two-step equations. They will identify that Step 1 is the correct first move and will successfully spot the sign error in Step 2. The 15% choosing C are likely those rushing who didn't double-check the final arithmetic.

**advanced:** A=95% B=1% C=2% D=2%
*   **Reasoning:** Advanced students (Target Grade 7-9) will solve the equation mentally before even looking at the steps. They will immediately see $k=59$ and identify Step 2 as a basic computational/logic error. Errors here are almost exclusively due to misreading the question.
