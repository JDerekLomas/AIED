In the UK secondary curriculum, this question tests two distinct concepts: **reciprocals** (the multiplicative inverse) and **negative number rules** (the product of two negatives is a positive).

Middle-ability students (Basic/Proficient) frequently struggle with the interplay of these two rules, often "dropping" the negative sign or believing that the reciprocal of a negative number must become positive.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic** (KS3 Year 7/8 Low Attainment / Foundation Tier GCSE Grade 1-2)
*Many students here do not yet understand the reciprocal. They often choose C or D because they see the numbers 3 and 4 and assume the answer must look exactly the same.*
**A=10% B=15% C=45% D=30%**

**basic** (KS3 Year 9 Developing / Foundation Tier GCSE Grade 3)
*Students likely recognise that the fraction needs to flip (reciprocal), but they will be highly confused by the negative sign. A common misconception at this level is that "flipping" a fraction also involves changing its sign, or that two negatives make a negative.*
**A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%**

**proficient** (KS3 High Attainment / Higher Tier GCSE Grade 4-6)
*These students generally understand that to get a product of 1, you need the reciprocal. However, the "-1" target is a distractor. Many will correctly identify $4/3$ as the reciprocal but fail to apply the rule that $(-) \times (+) = (-)$. They will mistakenly choose B thinking they need another negative to reach the target.*
**A=65% B=25% C=5% D=5%**

**advanced** (GCSE Grade 7-9 / A-Level)
*These students instinctively know that to keep the product negative, the multiplier must be positive. They quickly identify the multiplicative inverse ($4/3$). Errors here are usually due to "careless" reading of the negative sign in the question.*
**A=92% B=5% C=2% D=1%**

### Teacher's Summary of Errors:
*   **The "Same Sign" Trap (Option B):** This is the most common error for proficient students. They think: *"The answer is -1, and my starting number is negative, so my star must be negative too."* They forget that a negative times a negative would result in positive 1.
*   **The "Reciprocal means Negative" Myth (Option B):** A persistent misconception where students think "inverting" a fraction also means "inverting" the sign.
*   **Visual Matching (Option C/D):** Below-basic students often assume the "star" must be a version of the number already present in the equation.
