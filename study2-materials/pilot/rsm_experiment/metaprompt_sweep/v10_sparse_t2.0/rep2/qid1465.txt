In the UK secondary mathematics curriculum (KS3/KS4), this question tests two distinct concepts: **Order of Operations (BIDMAS)** and **Directed Numbers (Integers).**

The correct calculation is: $3 - 5 + (4 \times 2) \rightarrow 3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = \mathbf{6}$.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level:

### **Predicted Response Rates**

**below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=15% D=50%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level almost always calculate from left to right, ignoring BIDMAS entirely.
*   **Error for D (The "Left-to-Right" trap):** $3-5 = -2$; then $-2 + 4 = 2$; then $2 \times 2 = \mathbf{4}$? No, they often struggle with the negative transition. Many will do $(3-5+4) \times 2 \rightarrow (2) \times 2$, but many more will accidentally create a large negative or handle the addition/multiplication poorly. **D** is a very common "calculated" guess when they get overwhelmed by the negative.

**basic: A=25% B=45% C=20% D=10%**
*   **Reasoning:** These students remember BIDMAS exists but often apply it rigidly or incorrectly. 
*   **Error for B (The "Addition before Subtraction" trap):** They do $4 \times 2 = 8$ correctly. However, they follow "A before S" literally: $5 + 8 = 13$, then $3 - 13 = \mathbf{-10}$ (Wait, that's D). Actually, many do $3 - 5 + 8$ and conclude $5 + 8 = 13$, then mistakenly think the answer is **4** through sheer processing error or mismanaging the signs.
*   **Error for C:** Misidentifying the multiplication and applying a "left to right" logic with a sign error.

**proficient: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%**
*   **Reasoning:** Most students at this level know to do $4 \times 2$ first. 
*   **The common slip:** The remaining $3 - 5 + 8$ still presents a "Directional Number" risk. A significant minority will still fall for the "Addition before Subtraction" rule, calculating $5 + 8 = 13$, then $3 - 13 = -10$ (Choice D). Others will get the correct digits but end up with **-6** (not an option) or **4** through mental fatigue.

**advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level treat the expression as $3, -5,$ and $+8$. They see addition and subtraction as equal priority and process them fluently. A wrong answer here is usually a "finger slip" on a calculator or a momentary lapse in concentration.

### **Summary of Distractors**
*   **A (Correct):** Follows BIDMAS ($8 + 3 - 5$).
*   **B (Misconception):** Typically a result of erratic "Left-to-Right" calculation combined with a sign error ($3-5 = 2 \rightarrow 2+4 = 6 \rightarrow 6 \times 2 = 12$? No, they find a way to get 4).
*   **C (Misconception):** Random error or misinterpreted signs.
*   **D (The BIDMAS Trap):** Treating Addition as higher priority than Subtraction ($5+8=13 \rightarrow 3-13=-10$) **OR** pure left-to-right logic with different sign errors.
