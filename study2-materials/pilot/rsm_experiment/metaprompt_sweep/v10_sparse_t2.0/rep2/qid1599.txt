As a UK maths teacher, I would expect the distribution of results to reflect common misconceptions regarding the order of operations (BIDMAS), the visual "balance" of fractions, and the reciprocal error.

In the UK context:
*   **Below Basic** students often guess based on visual similarity or struggle with the concept of the vinculum (fraction bar) acting as a grouping symbol.
*   **Basic** students often recognize that division becomes a fraction but struggle with the placement of the numerator vs. denominator.
*   **Proficient** students understand the convention but may still fall for the "look-alike" distractor (C).
*   **Advanced** students near-universally recognize the standard algebraic notation.

Here are the predicted percentages:

**below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=25% D=15%**
*   *Analysis:* High distribution across all answers. Many will choose B because it "balances" the +4 on both sides, or C because they perform the division \(c/h\) first and then just "add the 4" separately.

**basic: A=55% B=15% C=20% D=10%**
*   *Analysis:* Most start to recognize A is the "maths way" of writing it, but a significant portion will still choose C (standard left-to-right processing without recognizing the brackets) or D (reciprocal error, putting the 'heavy' expression on top).

**proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%**
*   *Analysis:* Most have mastered the convention that the divisor goes in the denominator and the brackets disappear once the vinculum is used.

**advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%**
*   *Analysis:* This is a foundational "fluency" check for advanced students. Errors here are usually due to rushing/misreading rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.
