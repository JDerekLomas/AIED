As a UK maths teacher, I would analyse this question as a classic "distractor" problem involving division by a decimal or fractional result. This often catches out students who rely on "big number divided by small number" heuristics rather than algebraic manipulation.

Here is the predicted distribution based on UK Year 7–11 performance:

**below_basic:** 
*Often chooses C because they see the numbers 10 and 5 and assume the larger must be divided by the smaller ($10 \div 5 = 2$).*
**A=15% B=30% C=40% D=15%**

**basic:**
*Likely to fall for B ($10 \times 5 = 50$) because they know they need to "undo" the division but don't understand the placement of the variable in the denominator.*
**A=30% B=45% C=20% D=5%**

**proficient:**
*The majority will identify the correct answer, but a significant portion will still rush and pick C due to "calculator brain" (seeing 10 and 5 and intuitively thinking 2).*
**A=65% B=15% C=18% D=2%**

**advanced:**
*Should have a near-perfect success rate. They will instinctively swap $p$ and 10 or multiply through by $p$. Any errors here are likely "silly" transcription mistakes.*
**A=96% B=2% C=2% D=0%**

### Teacher Analysis of Distractors:
*   **A (0.5):** The Correct Answer ($5 \div 10$).
*   **B (50):** The **Inverse Error.** The student sees a fraction (division) and tries to undo it by multiplying the two visible numbers ($10 \times 5$). 
*   **C (2):** The **Commutative Error.** The student assumes division is commutative ($10 \div 5$) or follows the pattern "Big $\div$ Small." This is the most common error for students who lack confidence in algebra.
*   **D (No solution):** Chosen by students who feel $5$ is "too small" to be divided into 10 without knowing about fractions/decimals.
