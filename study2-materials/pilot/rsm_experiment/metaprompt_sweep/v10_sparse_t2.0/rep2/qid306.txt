In the UK secondary curriculum, this question probes two specific areas: left-to-right processing for addition/subtraction of equal priority (Problem P) and the application of BIDMAS/order of operations (Problem Q).

Here is a prediction of Year 7–9 student responses based on typical classroom misconceptions:

**below_basic:** A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** These students almost exclusively work left-to-right regardless of the operators involved. They see $4+5$ in Problem Q and calculate it immediately. A few might pick C if they have heard the "Addition before Subtraction" myth but lack the numeracy to apply it to Problem Q.

**basic:** A=35% B=45% C=10% D=10%
*   **Reasoning:** This group is beginning to remember BIDMAS ("Multiplication before Addition"), so they often get Problem Q right. However, they frequently struggle with Problem P, either following a strict "Addition before Subtraction" rule from the acronym (leading to $5+6$) or sticking to left-to-right. The competition between A and B is high here.

**proficient:** A=10% B=75% C=5% D=10%
*   **Reasoning:** Most students at this level understand that $\times$ takes priority (Problem Q). For Problem P, they generally understand that $+$ and $-$ have equal priority and should be done left-to-right. A small number still fall into the "A before S" trap (Option D) due to how BIDMAS is taught as a literal sequence.

**advanced:** A=5% B=90% C=0% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** High-ability students recognise that addition and subtraction are inverse operations with equal priority, confidently choosing $4-5$ for Problem P. They rarely miss the order of operations in Problem Q. Any errors are usually due to overthinking the question rather than a lack of knowledge.

### Key to Correct Answer (B):
*   **Problem P:** $+$ and $-$ are equal priority; we work left-to-right ($4-5$ first).
*   **Problem Q:** $\times$ has higher priority than $+$ ($5 \times 6$ first).
