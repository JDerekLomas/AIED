In the UK secondary mathematics curriculum, this question assesses understanding of **Order of Operations (BIDMAS)**. 

The calculation on the left ($8 + 12 \div 4$) requires division before addition, resulting in $8 + 3 = \mathbf{11}$. 
The calculation on the right ($(8 + 12) \div 4$) requires brackets before division, resulting in $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$. 
Since $11 > 5$, the correct answer is **A**.

Here is the predicted distribution of student responses by ability level:

**below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=50% D=5%**
*   **Reasoning:** These students almost universally read from left to right. They calculate the left side as $8+12=20$, then $20 \div 4=5$. Seeing the right side also has $8, 12, 4$, they assume it must be the same and choose **C**. If they notice the brackets and think they "change" things but aren't sure how, they often guess **B**.

**basic: A=35% B=20% C=40% D=5%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level have heard of BIDMAS but apply it inconsistently. Many will still fall into the "left-to-right" trap on the first expression. A significant portion will correctly solve the right side (5) but incorrectly solve the left side (5), leading them to **C**. Those who remember "Divide before Add" will get it right.

**proficient: A=75% B=10% C=10% D=5%**
*   **Reasoning:** Most students at this level routinely apply BIDMAS. They will identify that the lack of brackets on the left changes the order. Errors here are usually due to "careless" mental arithmetic (e.g., $12 \div 4 = 4$) rather than a conceptual misunderstanding of the order of operations.

**advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%**
*   **Reasoning:** Advanced students (Level 7-9) will recognise this immediately as a conceptual check on BIDMAS. They are unlikely to make an arithmetic error on such simple integers and will identify that the left-hand side is $8+3$ while the right-hand side is $20 \div 4$. Any wrong answers are likely accidental misclicks or misreading the inequality signs.
