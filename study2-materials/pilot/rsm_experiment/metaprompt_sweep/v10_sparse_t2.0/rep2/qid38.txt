In a UK secondary school context (Key Stage 3 or GCSE), this question tests the ability to find a common denominator involving algebraic terms.

The correct answer is **A**: $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic:** (Targeting Grade 1-2 / Lower Foundation)
Students at this level often treat algebraic fractions like integers or apply "add the tops, add the bottoms" logic without considering common denominators. 
*   **B** is the most common distractor here ($3+4$ and $2x+x$).
*   **A=15% B=55% C=15% D=15%**

**basic:** (Targeting Grade 3-4 / Foundation)
These students know they need a common denominator but often make a computational slip or fail to multiply the numerator when adjusting the denominator.
*   **D** is a very high "near miss" for these students ($3+4$ over the larger denominator $2x$).
*   **A=30% B=25% C=10% D=35%**

**proficient:** (Targeting Grade 5-6 / Higher)
Students understand the process of equivalent fractions. However, under time pressure, a common mistake is incorrectly doubling the $3$ instead of the $4$, or failing to simplify.
*   **A** becomes the clear frontrunner as they recognize the need for $2x$ as the denominator.
*   **A=70% B=5% C=10% D=15%**

**advanced:** (Targeting Grade 7-9 / Top Set)
These students perform the operation mentally almost instantly. If they get it wrong, it is usually a "silly mistake" or a reading error, rather than a conceptual one.
*   **A=94% B=1% C=2% D=3%**
