In a UK secondary school context (Key Stage 3 or GCSE), this question tests three distinct skills: substitution into a non-linear formula, squaring a decimal, and the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

Here is the prediction of student responses by ability level:

**below_basic:**
**A=10% B=25% C=55% D=10%**
*   **Analysis:** The majority of students at this level struggle with indices (powers). The most common error is multiplying the base ($x$) by the power, calculating $0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$. They then multiply this by $3$ to get **C (1.8)**. Some may ignore the square entirely and do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ (leading them to guess A as it "looks" similar), or pick B through a misunderstood memory of the 3 times table.

**basic:**
**A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%**
*   **Analysis:** These students recognize that $x^2$ means $x$ times itself, but they usually fail the decimal calculation. They calculate $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ (forgetting the second decimal place). Then, $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$, but since **D** looks too simple, they might choose **A (0.81)** because $0.9 \times 0.9$ or $0.3^4$ type confusion sets in. **B (0.27)** becomes the "smart guess" if they successfully calculate $3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27$ but misplace the decimal point.

**proficient:**
**A=15% B=65% C=5% D=15%**
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level (Grade 4/5) usually remember BIDMAS. They correctly square $0.3$ to get $0.09$. They then multiply $3 \times 0.09$ to arrive at the correct answer **B (0.27)**. The main pitfall here is the "decimal slip," where they do the BIDMAS correctly but think $0.3^2 = 0.9$, leading them to **D**.

**advanced:**
**A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%**
*   **Analysis:** These students (Grade 7+) have high arithmetic fluency. They are unlikely to be tricked by the order of operations and are comfortable with the fact that $(3/10)^2 = 9/100$. They will double-check the decimal placement and consistently reach **B**.

### Key to Options:
*   **A ($0.81$):** Common for students who think $(3 \times 0.3)^2$, i.e., doing multiplication before the power.
*   **B ($0.27$):** **Correct answer** ($3 \times 0.09$).
*   **C ($1.8$):** Calculated as $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$.
*   **D ($2.7$):** Calculated as $3 \times 0.9$ (mistakenly thinking $0.3^2 = 0.9$).
