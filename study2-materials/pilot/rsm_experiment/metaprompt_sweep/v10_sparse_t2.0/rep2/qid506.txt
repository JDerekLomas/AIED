Here is the predicted distribution of student responses based on typical UK secondary school data for Key Stage 3 and GCSE foundation/higher tiers.

**Key Misconceptions:**
*   **The "3 into 12" error (Choice A):** Students see the numbers 3 and 12 and perform $12 \div 3$, ignoring the fractional position of the 12.
*   **The "Linear Multiplication" error (Choice C):** Students attempt to "isolate $p$" by multiplying the 12 and the 3 ($12 \div 3$ or $12/3$ intuition, leading to 4).
*   **The "Add/Subtract" error (Choice D):** Students erroneously link 3 and 12 through addition or subtraction (though less common in this specific layout).

### Predicted Responses by Ability Level

**below_basic:** 
*(These students often struggle with the concept of an inverse operation applied to a fraction and frequently guess based on number bonds they recognize.)*
**A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%**

**basic:** 
*(Students at this level often correctly identify that they need to divide by 3, but perform the calculation as $12 \div 3$ because dividing a fraction feels counter-intuitive.)*
**A=55% B=25% C=10% D=10%**

**proficient:** 
*(Students understand the algebraic step "divide both sides by 3" but approximately one-third will still make a computational error when dividing the unit fraction.)*
**A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%**

**advanced:** 
*(These students instinctively treat $3p = 1/12$ as $p = 1/(12 \times 3)$ or multiply by the reciprocal $1/3$ accurately.)*
**A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%**

### Teacher Commentary:
*   **The Most Common Distractor is A.** In a mixed-ability UK classroom, you will find that "below_basic" and "basic" students see 3 and 12 and immediately write 4 or $1/4$. They are looking for a "clean" relationship between the numbers.
*   **Success on Choice B** usually indicates a student has moved past "instrumental understanding" (just moving numbers around) to "relational understanding" (knowing that dividing a twelfth into three parts makes the denominator larger).
