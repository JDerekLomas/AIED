As a UK maths teacher, I would analyse this question based on three common misconceptions: 
1. **The Index vs. Multiplication error:** Multiplying the base by the index (e.g., $3 \times 4 = 12$).
2. **The Negative Power parity error:** Believing that because the base is negative, the answer must stay negative, regardless of the even exponent.
3. **The "Calculator Entry" error:** Thinking $-3^4$ is the same as $(-3)^4$.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level:

**below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%**
*   **Analysis:** At this level, students struggle with index notation itself. The most attractive distractor is **B** ($3 \times 4$). They see the negative sign and often simply carry it through to the result (**D**) without a deep understanding of why. Option A is a rare "lucky" correct guess.

**basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%**
*   **Analysis:** These students recognise that $k^4$ means $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$, avoiding the multiplication error. However, they almost universally succumb to the "Negative sign persists" misconception. They see a negative input and assume a negative output, leading them strongly toward **C**.

**proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%**
*   **Analysis:** Most students at this level have mastered the "even power equals positive result" rule. Those who get it wrong (Option **C**) usually do so because they are over-reliant on calculators; if they type $-3^4$ without brackets, the calculator gives $-81$ (due to BIDMAS), and they lack the confidence to override it.

**advanced: A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%**
*   **Analysis:** Advanced students (targeting Grades 8/9 at GCSE) see this as a "low-hanging fruit" question. The only errors here are rare "slip-of-the-pen" moments where they move too quickly and select **C** because they are mentally processing the negative $k$.
