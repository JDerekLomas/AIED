In the UK secondary mathematics context, this question tests two distinct skills: **Order of Operations (BIDMAS)** and **Directed Numbers (Arithmetic with Negatives).**

The correct calculation is: $3 - 5 + (4 \times 2) \rightarrow 3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = \mathbf{6}$.

### Prediction of Student Responses

**below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=45% D=30%**
Students at this level almost always work strictly left-to-right, ignoring BIDMAS entirely.
*   **Most common error (C):** $(3 - 5 + 4) \times 2 \rightarrow 2 \times 2 = 4$; however, lower ability students often struggle with $3-5$ and mistakenly get $-6 \times 2 = -12$ or similar negative-influenced guesses. 
*   **Error (D):** $3 - (5+4) \times 2 \rightarrow 3 - 18 = -15$, but rounded to a likely "looking" number.

**basic: A=35% B=20% C=35% D=10%**
These students have heard of BIDMAS but often apply it incorrectly or have a weak grasp of negative number lines.
*   **The "Addition before Subtraction" Trap (B):** Many believe 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, so they do $3 - (5 + 8) = 3 - 13 = -10$ (Wait, they see 4... calculation error common here). Or they do $3 - 5 + 8$, but sum the 5 and 8 first: $3 - 13 = -10$ (often miscalculating to B).
*   **Left-to-Right (C):** $(3-5)+4 = 2 \rightarrow 2 \times 2 = 4$ (Resulting in B) or getting lost and picking C.

**proficient: A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%**
These students know to do $4 \times 2$ first. The primary hurdle here is the subsequent directed number calculation: $-2 + 8$.
*   **Correct (A):** Most will reach $3 - 5 + 8$ and correctly navigate the number line to get 6.
*   **The BIDMAS Trap (B/D):** A significant minority will still fall for the "Add before Subtract" rule, calculating $5 + 8 = 13$, then $3 - 13 = -10$.

**advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%**
At the advanced level (targeting Grade 7-9 GCSE), BIDMAS and negative integers are second nature.
*   **Correct (A):** The vast majority will identify the term $+8$ immediately. 
*   Any errors (B or D) would be due to extreme haste or a momentary "brain fade" regarding the priority of addition/subtraction.

### Key to the options:
*   **A (Correct):** $3 - 5 + 8 = 6$
*   **B (Mistake):** Doing $(3-5+4) \times 2 \rightarrow 2 \times 2 = 4$ OR Addition before Subtraction trap.
*   **C (Left-to-Right error):** Calculations like $(3-5+4) \times 2$ with sign errors.
*   **D (Negative/BIDMAS error):** $3 - (5+8) = -10$.
