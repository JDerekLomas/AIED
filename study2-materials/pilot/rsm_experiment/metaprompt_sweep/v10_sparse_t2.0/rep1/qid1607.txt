In the UK secondary curriculum (Key Stage 3/4), this question tests a student's ability to inverse operations across an equals sign—specifically multiplying by a denominator and then subtracting a constant.

The common misconception here is the **"sign change" error** in Step 2: the student sees the $+1$ and adds it to $60$ instead of subtracting it.

### Teacher Prediction by Ability Level

**below_basic:** (Targeting Grade 1-2 / low KS3)
These students struggle with formal algebraic steps. They often guess based on the "maths looks right" (60 and 61 are sequential). Many will see "60" in Step 1 and assume the whole thing is correct because $15 \times 4 = 60$ is a calculation they recognise.
**A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%**

**basic:** (Targeting Grade 3-4)
These students usually recognise that $15 \times 4 = 60$ is correct (Step 1). However, a very high percentage will fall for the "add to both sides" trap. They see $+1$ and instinctively move to the other side by adding. Because they found a path to the answer $k=61$, they will confidently select C.
**A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%**

**proficient:** (Targeting Grade 5-6)
These students are beginning to internalise that "the inverse of addition is subtraction." They will validate Step 1 correctly, but they will pause at Step 2. They will identify that Isaac should have subtracted 1. Therefore, they will isolate Step 1 as the only correct part.
**A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%**

**advanced:** (Targeting Grade 7+)
These students treat two-step equations as a routine process. They will check Step 1 ($15 \times 4 = 60$) and Step 2 ($60 - 1 = 59$) almost instantly. They will notice Isaac's error in Step 2 immediately.
**A=92% B=2% C=4% D=2%**

### Final Predicted Percentages:

**below_basic:** A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
**basic:** A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
**proficient:** A=65% B=05% C=25% D=05%
**advanced:** A=92% B=02% C=04% D=02%
