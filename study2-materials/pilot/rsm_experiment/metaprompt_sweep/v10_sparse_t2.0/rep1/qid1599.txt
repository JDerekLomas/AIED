In the UK secondary mathematics curriculum (Key Stage 3 and GCSE), this question tests a student's ability to translate linear operations into fractional algebraic notation.

The primary "distractors" here target common misconceptions: **D** is a "term reversal" error, while **C** is an "order of operations" error regarding the scope of the division bar.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic (Working towards Grade 2)**
*These students often struggle with the "visual" layout of algebra. They frequently select **D** because they intuitively place the longer expression on top, or **B** because they feel they need to "add something" to the numerator to make it look balanced.*
**A=25% B=25% C=20% D=30%**

**basic (Working towards Grade 4)**
*Students at this level recognize that division is shown as a fraction, but they often struggle with the grouping nature of the brackets. **C** is a very common trap here, as they see the $h$ as the immediate neighbor to the division sign and "detach" the $+4$.*
**A=55% B=10% C=25% D=10%**

**proficient (Working towards Grade 6)**
*These students have a solid grasp of algebraic conventions. They understand that the expression in the brackets must remain as a single entity (the denominator). Errors usually occur only through haste.*
**A=85% B=3% C=8% D=4%**

**advanced (Working towards Grade 8/9)**
*At this level, the "vinculum" (the fraction bar) is correctly understood as an implied grouping symbol. The success rate here should be near total.*
**A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%**
