Here is the predicted distribution of responses for UK students based on common misconceptions found at GCSE level (Key Stage 4).

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A (The 'Difference' Error):** Student calculates $-7 + 5$ or confuses the difference between 7 and 5 for the middle term instead of the sum.
*   **B (Correct):** FOIL/Grid method applied correctly ($m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35$).
*   **C (The 'Positive' Error):** Student assumes two negatives make everything positive, or simply ignores the signs of the constants entirely.
*   **D (The 'Multiplication' Error):** Student correctly sums $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$, but fails the "negative $\times$ negative = positive" rule for the final term.

### Predicted Responses by Ability Level

**below_basic:** 
*These students often guess or focus only on the numbers 5 and 7 without understanding the quadratic structure or signed number rules.*
**A=30% B=20% C=35% D=15%**

**basic:** 
*Targeting Grade 3/4. Usually comfortable with $m \times m = m^2$ and finding the middle term $-12m$, but very prone to the common error that $(-5) \times (-7) = -35$.*
**A=15% B=35% C=15% D=35%**

**proficient:** 
*Targeting Grade 5/6. Understands the FOIL/Grid method. The main risk here is a lapse in concentration regarding the final sign.*
**A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%**

**advanced:** 
*Targeting Grade 7+. Should identify the correct answer almost instantly; errors are likely high-speed slips only.*
**A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%**
