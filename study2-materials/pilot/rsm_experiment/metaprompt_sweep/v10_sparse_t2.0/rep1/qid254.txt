As a UK maths teacher, I would interpret these ability levels in the context of GCSE targeting (Grades 1-9). This specific question tests two "hidden" hurdles in averages: the role of zero as a value and the order of operations (BIDMAS).

Here is the prediction of student responses:

**below_basic** (Targeting Grade 1-2)
*Focus: Often forget the zero exists as a value and struggle with the division notation.*
* **A=20%**
* **B=30%** (Attracted to the horizontal layout; often miss the lack of brackets)
* **C=40%** (Common misconception: "0 doesn't count, so divide by 4")
* **D=10%**

**basic** (Targeting Grade 3-4)
*Focus: Understand they need to add them all, but frequently ignore the 0 when counting the total numbers (denominator).*
* **A=25%** (Identify 5 numbers, but "forget" to write +0)
* **B=20%**
* **C=45%** (Strongly believe that because 0 doesn't change the sum, it shouldn't be counted in the divisor)
* **D=10%**

**proficient** (Targeting Grade 5-6)
*Focus: Understand the concept of the mean with a zero, but vulnerable to BIDMAS traps in calculator/linear entry.*
* **A=60%** (Correctly identify that adding 0 is implicit and the divisor is 5)
* **B=25%** (This is the "Calculator Trap"—they know the steps but don't spot that B only divides the 7 by 5)
* **C=10%**
* **D=5%**

**advanced** (Targeting Grade 7-9)
*Focus: Precision and spotting mathematical technicalities.*
* **A=85%** (Correctly identify A is the only valid mathematical expression)
* **B=5%** (Unlikely to miss the BIDMAS error)
* **C=0%**
* **D=10%** (Advanced students sometimes overthink and pick D because the 0 isn't explicitly in the numerator of A, even though the value is identical)

### Summary Table
| Level | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **below_basic** | 20% | 30% | 40% | 10% |
| **basic** | 25% | 20% | 45% | 10% |
| **proficient** | 60% | 25% | 10% | 5% |
| **advanced** | 85% | 5% | 0% | 10% |

**Teacher's Note:** Option **B** is the classic "scientific calculator error." Option **C** is the most common conceptual error regarding the mean. Option **A** is correct because $0+1+3+4+7 = 1+3+4+7$, so the numerator value is correct and the denominator reflects the correct count of five data points.
