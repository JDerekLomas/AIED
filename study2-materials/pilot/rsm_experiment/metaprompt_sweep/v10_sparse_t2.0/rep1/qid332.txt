In the context of the UK curriculum (KS3/GCSE), this is a classic diagnostic question testing "Order of Operations in Reverse" (SAMDOB) versus distributive properties.

Here is the prediction of student responses by ability level:

### **Predicted Responses (%)**

| Ability Level | A (Only Tom) | B (Only Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 45% | 15% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 55% | 25% | 15% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 70% | 10% | 18% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 88% | 2% | 10% | 0% |

### **Teacher Analysis of Responses**

**Correct Answer: A (Only Tom)**

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level often struggle with the structure of fractions. Many will guess **B** because they see the "$\times 3$" and want to apply it immediately to the 12 to "get rid of the fraction." They often fail to realize that if you multiply by 3, you must multiply *every* term (including the $-5$).
*   **Basic:** These students are usually taught the "flowchart" or "inverse operations" method (add 5 first, then multiply by 3). Because Tom follows the standard procedure they've practiced, they select **A**. They see Katie’s line as "breaking the rules" because she didn't multiply the 5.
*   **Proficient:** These students are confident in solving two-step equations. They recognize Tom is performing the most efficient first step. Some may choose **C** if they have a loose understanding of "multiplying everything by the denominator" but haven't quite mastered the distributive property over subtraction.
*   **Advanced:** Almost all will correctly identify **A**. The small percentage choosing **C** represents students who over-analyze the question, thinking Katie *could* be right if she meant to multiply the whole equation, but then realize she failed to multiply the constant term ($-5$).

### **The Common Misconception**
The trap in this question is **Katie's method**. To make Katie’s line ($x - 5 = 36$) correct, the original equation would have needed to be $\frac{x-5}{3} = 12$. Students who do not distinguish between a "fraction over the whole side" and a "fraction as a single term" consistently get this wrong.
