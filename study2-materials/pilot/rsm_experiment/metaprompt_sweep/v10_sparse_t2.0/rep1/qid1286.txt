In the context of the UK curriculum (GCSE Higher Tier), this question tests a student's ability to recall the formula for the volume of a sphere ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) and successfully rearrange it to make $r$ the subject.

The most common errors involve incorrect algebraic manipulation (multiplying by 4 and dividing by 3 instead of vice-versa) and confusion regarding the placement of $\pi$.

**below_basic:** (Target Grade 3/4) Students at this level often don't know the formula or struggle with three-step rearrangement. Many will pick A because the numbers 4, 3, and $\pi$ are in their "familiar" positions from the standard formula, or B due to a random guess.

**basic:** (Target Grade 5/6) Students likely remember the formula but often make a "cross-multiplication" error, mistakenly multiplying $V$ by 4 instead of 3.

**proficient:** (Target Grade 7) These students generally rearrange correctly but may pause to ensure the cube root extends over the entire fraction. C is the clear dominant choice here.

**advanced:** (Target Grade 8/9) These students perform the rearrangement ($3V = 4\pi r^3 \rightarrow \frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$) fluently and are unlikely to be distracted by the incorrect algebraic structures.
