Here is the predicted distribution of student responses based on typical UK secondary school assessment data (Year 9–11).

### The Mathematical Thinking behind the options:
*   **A (20):** Operational error. The student multiplies all visible numbers $(4 \times 5 \text{ or } 2 \times 10)$ or performs $4 + 10 + 2 + 4$.
*   **B (3):** Calculation error/Inverse error. Student correctly identifies $x=0$, simplifies to $2y=10$, but then calculates $10 - 2 + 0$ or makes a systematic error in division. Or, more likely, they guess a small integer because it "looks right" in a sequence.
*   **C (5):** **Correct answer.** Substitution of $x=0$ leading to $2y=10$, therefore $y=5$.
*   **D (2.5):** Reverse substitution/Confusion. The student thinks they need to solve for $x$ when $y=0$ (finding the x-intercept instead of the y-intercept) or incorrectly divides 10 by 4.

### Predicted Responses

**below_basic (Working at Grade 1-2):**
*Focus on additive relationships or simply combining all numbers seen in the question.*
**A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%**

**basic (Working at Grade 3-4):**
*Understand that substitution is required, but often struggle with the two-step linear equation or divide by the wrong coefficient.*
**A=15% B=20% C=45% D=20%**

**proficient (Working at Grade 5-6):**
*The majority correctly substitute $x=0$. Errors are usually due to "careless" mental arithmetic or swapping the x and y coordinates (finding the x-intercept).*
**A=5% B=10% C=75% D=10%**

**advanced (Working at Grade 7-9):**
*Fluent in substitution and solving linear equations mentally. Errors are negligible and usually down to misreading the equation.*
**A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%**
