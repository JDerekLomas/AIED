In the UK secondary mathematics curriculum, this question targets **balancing linear equations involving fractions**. The common misconceptions usually revolve around the inverse operation (multiplying instead of dividing) or performing the division incorrectly (treating $12 \div 3$ rather than $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$).

Here is the prediction of student responses by ability level:

**below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%**
*   **The Logic:** Students at this level often gravitate towards **Option A**. They see the numbers 3 and 12 and perform the most familiar division ($12 \div 3 = 4$), placing it in the numerator or denominator intuitively. **Option C** is also popular because they ignore the fraction entirely and simply solve for "the gap" between 3 and 12 using multiplication ($3 \times 4 = 12$).

**basic: A=35% B=30% C=15% D=20%**
*   **The Logic:** These students know they need to divide $\frac{1}{12}$ by 3, but they struggle with the mechanics of dividing fractions. Many will still fall for the "12 divided by 3" trap (**Option A**). However, a significant portion will attempt the calculation and successfully reach $12 \times 3 = 36$ in the denominator (**Option B**). **Option D** appears from those who confuse $3^2$ or subtract 3 from 12 incorrectly.

**proficient: A=10% B=80% C=2% D=8%**
*   **The Logic:** Students at this level understand that to solve $3p = x$, you must divide $x$ by 3. They correctly identify that $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$ is equivalent to $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$. They are much less likely to choose Option A, as they have developed a sense of scale (knowing that $p$ must be smaller than $\frac{1}{12}$).

**advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0% D=1%**
*   **The Logic:** These students treat this as a one-step fluency task. They immediately see the operation as multiplying the denominator by 3. Errors here are almost exclusively down to "silly mistakes" (transcription errors or misreading the question), but the vast majority will select **Option B** instantly.
