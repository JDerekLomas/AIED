In the context of the UK curriculum (GCSE Foundation/Higher), this question tests linear substitution and solving simple equations.

The correct mathematical process is:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$ (**Answer C**)

### Predicted Responses

**below_basic (Working at Grade 1–2):** 
These students often struggle with negative signs or use "intuitive" operations rather than algebraic ones.
*   **A (4.25):** Very high. They may calculate $30 + 6 + 6.5$ or misinterpret $6y$ as adding.
*   **D (2.7):** They often do $30 - 3$ then divide by 10 (subtracting the $6y$ value instead of adding it).
*   **A=40% B=15% C=15% D=30%**

**basic (Working at Grade 3–4):**
Students can substitute but frequently make one sign error or calculation slip.
*   **D (2.7):** This is the "standard" mistake—forgetting that $-6y$ becomes $+3$ on the other side.
*   **A (4.25):** Resulting from a mistake like $10x = 30 + 12.5$ or similar confusion.
*   **A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%**

**proficient (Working at Grade 5–6):**
Students at this level are usually secure with substitution and two-step equations.
*   **D (2.7):** A lingering mistake for those rushing through the "change side, change sign" rule.
*   **A (4.25):** Rare at this level; usually a transcription error.
*   **A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%**

**advanced (Working at Grade 7+):**
High level of accuracy expected; mistakes are almost exclusively down to "silly" arithmetic slips under time pressure.
*   **C (3.3):** The vast majority will identify this easily.
*   **D (2.7):** The only viable distractor if they do $30-3$ in their head.
*   **A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%**
