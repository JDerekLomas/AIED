In the UK context, these problems test two distinct areas of "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS): the left-to-right rule for addition/subtraction, and the priority of multiplication over addition.

**Teacher Analysis:**
*   **Problem P:** Tests the common misconception that Addition comes *before* Subtraction because 'A' precedes 'S' in BIDMAS. In reality, they have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right. Correct first step: $4-5$.
*   **Problem Q:** Tests the core understanding that Multiplication takes priority over Addition. Correct first step: $5 \times 6$.
*   **Correct Answer: B**

Here is the predicted distribution of student responses by ability level:

### **below_basic**
*These students typically read all math problems like a sentence (left-to-right) regardless of operators. They have little to no internalised BIDMAS rules.*
**A=65% B=20% C=10% D=5%**
*   **A is the "left-to-right" trap.** Most will choose this because it feels natural to start at the beginning of both strings.
*   **C/D** are low because they require jumping to the middle of the expression, which these students rarely do spontaneously.

### **basic**
*These students have been taught BIDMAS/BODMAS but over-apply it. They often strictly follow the letter order, believing Addition MUST happen before Subtraction.*
**A=15% B=25% C=15% D=45%**
*   **D is the most common answer here.** These students know $5 \times 6$ comes first in Q, but they rigidly believe $5+6$ must come first in P because "A comes before S."
*   **B** (Correct) is starting to appear as some understand the left-to-right rule.

### **proficient**
*These students are reliable with multiplication priority. The main hurdle is whether they have unlearned the "A before S" myth.*
**A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%**
*   **B is the majority.** Most Year 8/9 proficient students have been corrected on the left-to-right nature of AS/DM.
*   **D remains the "high-level" distractor.** Even good students often fall back on the mnemonic literalism when working quickly.

### **advanced**
*These students treat the expressions as terms and understand operator hierarchy perfectly.*
**A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%**
*   **B is the overwhelming choice.** Errors are usually due to misreading the question rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.
*   **D** captures the tiny percentage who might second-guess the left-to-right rule under exam pressure.
