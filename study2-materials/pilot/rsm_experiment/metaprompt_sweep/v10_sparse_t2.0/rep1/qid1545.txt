In the UK secondary curriculum, this question tests **BIDMAS** (Order of Operations). The common pitfalls involve reading the expression strictly left-to-right (ignoring division priority) or assuming that the same numbers must yield the same result regardless of brackets.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level:

**Below Basic (Working towards GCSE Grade 1-2)**
*Students at this level often calculate sequentially (Left-to-Right) or guestimate based on the "visual length" of the sum. Many will calculate $8+12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$ for both sides, leading them to choose "Equal".*
*   **A ($>$):** 20%
*   **B ($<$):** 15%
*   **C ($=$):** 60%
*   **D ($\geq$):** 5%

**Basic (GCSE Grade 3-4)**
*These students are aware of BIDMAS but frequently misapply it. Many will correctly solve the right side ($20 \div 4 = 5$) but will still struggle with the lack of brackets on the left, often falling into the left-to-right trap. They are less likely to choose "D" as they understand it's a comparison of two fixed values.*
*   **A ($>$):** 40%
*   **B ($<$):** 15%
*   **C ($=$):** 40%
*   **D ($\geq$):** 5%

**Proficient (GCSE Grade 5-7)**
*Most students here will correctly identify that $12 \div 4$ must happen first on the left side ($8 + 3 = 11$) and the brackets happen first on the right ($20 \div 4 = 5$). Errors usually occur from mental arithmetic slips rather than conceptual misunderstanding.*
*   **A ($>$):** 80%
*   **B ($<$):** 10%
*   **C ($=$):** 8%
*   **D ($\geq$):** 2%

**Advanced (GCSE Grade 8-9 / A-Level)**
*At this level, students will instantly recognise the structure of the problem. They will compute $11 > 5$ almost reflexively or recognise that the left side is "8 plus a bit" while the right side is "a quarter of 20".*
*   **A ($>$):** 97%
*   **B ($<$):** 1%
*   **C ($=$):** 1%
*   **D ($\geq$):** 1%

**Teacher's Key for the student's working:**
*   **Left Hand Side:** $8 + (12 \div 4) \rightarrow 8 + 3 = \mathbf{11}$
*   **Right Hand Side:** $(8 + 12) \div 4 \rightarrow 20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$
*   **Result:** $11 > 5$ (Option A)
