As a UK maths teacher, I would analyse this question as a test of "functional reciprocal understanding" vs. "procedural misapplication."

Many students struggle when the unknown is the denominator. The most common error is the "division by intuition," where students simply divide the larger number by the smaller number regardless of their position.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

**below_basic:** A=20% B=25% **C=45%** D=10%
*   **Reasoning:** At this level, many students follow a "biggest divided by smallest" heuristic. They see 10 and 5 and immediately compute $10 \div 5 = 2$. They often ignore the structure of the equation entirely. Choice B is also attractive as a "multiplication guess" ($10 \times 5$).

**basic:** A=35% **B=30%** C=25% D=10%
*   **Reasoning:** Students have learned they need to "do something" to move the $p$. However, they often use the inverse operation on the wrong side. They might multiply both sides by 5 (instead of $p$) to get $p=50$. Choice A starts to emerge here as some students intuitively realise $p$ must be "smaller" but can't quite show the work.

**proficient:** **A=65%** B=10% C=20% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** Most students at this level can rearrange the formula correctly: $10p = 5$, therefore $p = 5/10$. However, a significant "lapse" group will still choose C because they perform the final division $10 \div 5$ out of habit, even after correctly rearranging the equation to the linear form.

**advanced:** **A=95%** B=1% C=3% D=1%
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level recognise this as a simple reciprocal relationship ($p = 5/10$) or mentally check their work by substituting the answer back into the equation: $5 \div 0.5 = 10$. Errors here are almost exclusively due to rushing/human error.
