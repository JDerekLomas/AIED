In the UK secondary curriculum, this question targets **expanding binomials**, specifically the rule for multiplying directed numbers (integers).

Here is the predicted distribution of responses based on typical student misconceptions encountered in Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4 (GCSE).

### Predicted Student Responses

| Ability Level | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 20% | 25% | 40% |
| **Basic** | 40% | 25% | 10% | 25% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 10% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0.5% | 0.5% |

### Teacher's Rationale and Analysis

#### **Below Basic (Low Prior Attainment / Working towards Grade 1-2)**
*   **Most popular answer: D (-5)**
*   These students often confuse the operation required when expanding brackets. They see $-1$ and $-4$ and perform **addition** instead of multiplication ($(-1) + (-4) = -5$).
*   They often choose Option C if they remember "two minuses make a plus" but still perform addition ($1 + 4 = 5$).

#### **Basic (Grade 3-4)**
*   **Most popular answer: A (+4)**
*   Students at this level generally understand that brackets involve multiplication. However, there is still a significant pull toward **B (-4)**.
*   The error in B usually stems from the "one minus" rule; they see the negative sign on one number and apply it to the result, or they simply carry over the sign of the larger digit.
*   D remains a "distractor" for those who panic and revert to additive reasoning.

#### **Proficient (Grade 5-7)**
*   **Most popular answer: A (+4)**
*   These students have mastered the mnemonic "Negative $\times$ Negative = Positive." 
*   Errors at this level are usually "slip" errors (Option B) rather than conceptual ones. They are unlikely to choose C or D because they correctly identify the operation as multiplication.

#### **Advanced (Grade 8-9)**
*   **Most popular answer: A (+4)**
*   This is a "base level" skill for an advanced student. They will identify the terms as $-1$ and $-4$ instantly. 
*   The 2% margin of error accounts for simple "exam hall blindness" where a student might glance at the question too quickly.

### Teacher Tip for Intervention:
To clear up the common **D (-5)** error, I would ask the student: *"When we expand $(x+2)(x+3)$, do we do $2+3$ or $2 \times 3$ for the last term?"* This usually prompts them to self-correct the operation for the negative numbers.
