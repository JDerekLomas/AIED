In a UK secondary school context (Key Stage 3 or GCSE), this question tests three distinct skills: substitution, the order of operations (BIDMAS), and calculating with decimals.

The most common "distractor" in this question is option A, which results from performing the operations in the wrong order: multiplying $3$ by $0.3$ first ($0.9$), then squaring it ($0.9^2 = 0.81$).

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic (Working at Grade 1/2)**
*These students struggle with indices and often interpret $x^2$ as $x \times 2$. They also struggle with decimal placement.*
*   **A=10% B=15% C=50% D=25%**
*   **Primary Logic:** Most will choose **C**. They calculate $0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$, then $3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$. Others may guess **D** simply because the digits "27" look familiar from 3 times 9.

**basic (Working at Grade 3/4)**
*These students are aware that they should square first, but frequently make errors when squaring decimals or succumb to the temptation of working left-to-right.*
*   **A=45% B=15% C=15% D=25%**
*   **Primary Logic:** **A** is the dominant error here (the "Linear Trap"). They do $(3 \times 0.3)^2$. A significant number will reach **D** through correct methods, while some will choose **B** because they correctly get $0.09$ but then struggle with the decimal multiplication.

**proficient (Working at Grade 5/6)**
*These students understand BIDMAS and can square numbers, but are prone to "decimal slips" (thinking $0.3^2 = 0.9$).*
*   **A=15% B=10% C=5% D=70%**
*   **Primary Logic:** The majority will get **D**. They know to square $0.3$ first. The main error resulting in **A** or **B** comes from misplaced decimals (e.g., $0.3^2 = 0.09$, but then they calculate $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$ but doubt themselves and pick the "sensible looking" B).

**advanced (Working at Grade 7+)**
*These students have mastered index notation and the manipulation of decimals.*
*   **A=2% B=3% C=0% D=95%**
*   **Primary Logic:** These students systematically calculate $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$, then $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$ (**D**). The very small percentage of errors would be "finger slips" or over-confidence leading to a rushed B.

***

**Correct Answer: D ($0.27$)**
*Step 1: $0.3^2 = 0.09$*
*Step 2: $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$*
