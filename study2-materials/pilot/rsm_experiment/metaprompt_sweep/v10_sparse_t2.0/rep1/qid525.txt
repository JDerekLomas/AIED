Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical UK Key Stage 3 and GCSE misconceptions and performance data.

**The Logic behind the errors:**
*   **D (The "Add across" error):** Adding numerators ($7+1$) and denominators ($10+4$). Common in lower sets.
*   **A (The "Improper fraction" result):** The student calculates correctly but ignores the instruction to leave it as a mixed number.
*   **C (The "Common Denominator" error):** Students multiply denominators ($10 \times 4$) but fail to adjust the numerators correctly, or simply lose track of the integer.

**below_basic:** A=10% B=15% C=25% D=50%  
*Students at this level almost instinctively add the denominators (10+4=14). They struggle with the concept of a common denominator and are likely to choose D because it "looks" like the numbers in the question.*

**basic:** A=20% B=35% C=15% D=30%  
*At this level, students know they need a common denominator but often forget to multiply the numerators accordingly. The choice of B increases as they begin to manage the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) separately, but many still fall for the simplicity of D.*

**proficient:** A=25% B=60% C=10% D=5%  
*Proficient students (roughly Grade 4/5) usually find the common denominator of 20. Their most frequent mistake is calculating the correct value ($\frac{99}{20}$) and stopping there, missing the "Mixed Number" instruction, leading them to A.*

**advanced:** A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%  
*Advanced students (Grade 7+) will process the whole numbers and fractions separately ($4 + \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20}$) or convert to improper fractions and back with high accuracy. Errors here are usually "slip" errors or misreading the final format requirement.*
