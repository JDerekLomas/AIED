Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical UK Year 7–9 performance data and common misconceptions encountered in the classroom.

**Key Misconceptions:**
*   **C (Below Basic):** The "Add Everything" error—adding the whole numbers ($2+1$), the numerators ($1+2$), and the denominators ($5+5$).
*   **D (Basic):** The "Denominator Error"—successfully adding whole numbers and numerators but mistakenly adding the denominators.
*   **B (Proficient/Advanced):** The "Instruction Oversight"—calculating the value correctly as an improper fraction but failing to convert it back to a mixed number as requested.

### **Predicted Student Responses**

**below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=45% D=25%**
Students at this level often treat the components of the fraction as four independent integers. Choice **C** is highly attractive because it follows the logic of "add across everything." Choice **D** is also common as they recognize the whole number should be 3 but apply the same additive logic to the bottom of the fraction.

**basic: A=45% B=10% C=15% D=30%**
Students here are starting to remember that the denominator stays the same, but the temptation to add the denominators (Choice **D**) remains the most frequent pitfall. They are less likely to choose **C** as they recognize $2+1=3$.

**proficient: A=80% B=10% C=2% D=8%**
Most students in this bracket have mastered the procedure for adding fractions with like denominators. The errors here are usually down to "examination rush." Choice **B** occurs when a student converts to improper fractions to add ($\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5}$) but forgets the final step of converting back to a mixed number.

**advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%**
Advanced students will almost certainly get the numerical value correct. The tiny percentage of errors would likely fall on **B** (ignoring the "mixed number" instruction) or a simple clerical error.
