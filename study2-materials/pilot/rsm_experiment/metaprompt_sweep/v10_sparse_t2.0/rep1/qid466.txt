Here are the predicted response patterns for UK Year 8 or 9 students (approx. ages 12–14) based on typical misconceptions regarding fractions and directed numbers.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
*   **A:** Reciprocal found correctly, but the negative sign is ignored/lost.
*   **B: (Correct)** Reciprocal and sign rule applied.
*   **C:** Confusion with "additive inverse" or simply picking the positive version of the number in the question.
*   **D:** Mirroring the question; a common guess when the relationship between numbers isn't understood.

**below_basic:** 
*Most likely to choose D or C. These students often see multiplication as "keeping things the same" or struggle with the concept of a reciprocal entirely.*
A=15% B=15% C=35% D=35%

**basic:**
*Students understand they need to "flip" the fraction (A or B), but usually falter on the double negative rule. There is a strong tendency to believe that because the target is negative, the answer must be positive (A).*
A=50% B=20% C=15% D=15%

**proficient:**
*The majority will identify the need for a reciprocal. Most will correctly apply the rule that a negative times a positive results in a negative, thus selecting B. Some will still make a "sign error" slip.*
A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%

**advanced:**
*High fluency with multiplicative inverses and negative integers. Error rates here are typically down to "silly" misreads of the question rather than lack of knowledge.*
A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
