In a UK secondary school context (Key Stage 3 or 4), this question tests the ability to find a common denominator involving algebraic terms. 

Here is the prediction of student responses by ability level:

**Correct Answer: A ($\frac{11}{2x}$)**

---

### **below_basic**
**A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%**
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level often treat algebraic fractions like integers or apply "intuitive" (but incorrect) rules. 
*   **The "B" Distractor:** This is the most common error. Students simply add the numerators ($3+4=7$) and add the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). 
*   **The "D" Distractor:** Students recognise they need a common denominator and pick $2x$, but they forget to adjust the second numerator, leading to $\frac{3+4}{2x} = \frac{7}{2x}$.

### **basic**
**A=40% B=20% C=5% D=35%**
*   **Analysis:** These students understand that they cannot just add the denominators, but they frequently fail the execution of finding an equivalent fraction.
*   **The "D" Distractor:** Many will identify $2x$ as the common denominator but only "copy" the 4 across without doubling it.
*   **Success rate:** About 4 in 10 will successfully identify that the second fraction must become $\frac{8}{2x}$.

### **proficient**
**A=85% B=5% C=2% D=8%**
*   **Analysis:** GCSE Grade 5/6 students are generally reliable with linear algebraic fractions. 
*   **The "A" Success:** They will multiply the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$ to get $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}$ and reach $\frac{11}{2x}$ comfortably. 
*   **Errors:** Occasional "silly mistakes" where they calculate $3+8=11$ but then accidentally add the denominators to get $\frac{11}{4x}$ (not listed as an option here) or revert to $D$ due to rushing.

### **advanced**
**A=98% B=0% C=0% D=2%**
*   **Analysis:** Higher Tier students (targeting Grade 7+) will find this trivial.
*   **Success rate:** Nearly 100%. Any errors are likely purely clerical or down to misreading the question as a multiplication instead of an addition.
