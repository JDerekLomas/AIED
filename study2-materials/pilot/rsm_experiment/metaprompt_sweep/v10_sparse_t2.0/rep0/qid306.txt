In the UK secondary school context (Year 7–9), these questions specifically target the application of **BIDMAS/BODMAS** and the "left-to-right" rule for equal priority operations.

The correct answer is **B**.

### Teacher's Rationale and Analysis

**Below Basic (Working well below age-related expectations):**
*   **Most common error (A):** These students almost always read calculations purely left-to-right, regardless of the operators involved. They treat maths like reading a sentence. They likely haven't internalised BIDMAS yet or apply it inconsistently.
*   **Why B is low:** It requires acknowledging that "order of operations" exists and correctly applying it to only one of the two scenarios.

**Basic (Working toward expectations):**
*   **The BIDMAS Trap (D):** At this level, students have been taught BIDMAS/BODMAS, but they often take the acronym **literally**. Because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym, they mistakenly believe they must *always* do addition first in Problem P. This leads them to answers C or D.
*   **Split (A vs B):** There is often a 50/50 toss-up here between those following the left-to-right "reading" habit and those trying to remember the BIDMAS rule.

**Proficient (Meeting age-related expectations):**
*   **Success in Problem Q:** Most students at this level understand that Multiplication takes priority over Addition.
*   **The "Equal Priority" Hurdle:** Some proficient students still fall for the **D** trap (Addition before Subtraction). However, UK curriculum teaching heavily emphasises that + and - have equal priority, so the majority will correctly identify that Problem P should be done left-to-right.

**Advanced (Exceeding expectations / Higher Tier GCSE):**
*   **Fluency:** These students recognise that in Problem P, the minus sign is effectively a negative property of the 5. They are comfortable with left-to-right execution and immediate application of BIDMAS hierarchy.
*   **High B:** Errors at this level are usually due to "skimming" the question too quickly rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.
