Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on typical UK secondary school data (GCSE Foundation/Higher).

**The Correct Answer is A.**

### Predicted Responses

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Misconception) | C (Calculation Error) | D (The "Add Top/Bottom" Error) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 20% | 15% | 50% |
| **Basic** | 40% | 25% | 10% | 25% |
| **Proficient** | 75% | 10% | 5% | 10% |
| **Advanced** | 96% | 2% | 1% | 1% |

### Teacher's Analysis of Distractors

*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$): The Additive Misconception.**
    Students at the **Below Basic** and lower **Basic** levels frequently apply "freshman’s dream" logic to algebraic fractions. They add the numerators ($3+4=7$) and pick one of the denominators (usually the larger one) or assume $x+2x = 2x$ in some vague sense. This is the most common error for students who lack a grasp of common denominators.

*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$): Adding Everything.**
    This is common among students who try to apply fraction addition but think they must add both the numerators and the denominators ($3+4$ and $2x+x$). This is a very common mistake at the **Below Basic/Foundation** level.

*   **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$): Misplaced Factor.**
    This student recognises they need a common denominator and chooses $x$. They correctly identify that they need to multiply $4$ by $2$, but they accidentally "lose" the 2 in the denominator during the final step or conclude that since both now have $x$, the 2 is no longer needed.

*   **Option A ($\frac{11}{2x}$): Correct Logic.**
    **Proficient** and **Advanced** students will quickly identify $2x$ as the lowest common multiple. They rewrite the second fraction as $\frac{8}{2x}$ and correctly sum the numerators. **Advanced** students will rarely miss this, as it is a standard procedural fluency task for them.
