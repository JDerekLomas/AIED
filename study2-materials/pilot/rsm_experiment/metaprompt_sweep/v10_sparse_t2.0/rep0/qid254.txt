As a UK maths teacher, I would categorize this question as a test of two distinct skills: understanding that **zero is a data value** and recognizing **correct mathematical notation (order of operations)**.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses based on typical student misconceptions at KS3/KS4 level:

**below_basic:** A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
*   **A/C bias:** These students often believe 0 "doesn't count." They will split between dividing by 5 (total items including zero) and dividing by 4 (the "meaningful" numbers).
*   **Note:** Many will choose A because they have been taught "add them up and divide by how many there are," but they mentally skip the 0 in the sum while acknowledging it in the count.

**basic:** A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
*   **The "Zero" trap:** Most students at this level understand that the 0 must be counted in the divisor, leading them firmly to A. 
*   **Notation ignorance:** They see the fraction bar in A as "correct" and do not realize that $0+1+3+4+7$ is technically the same sum as $1+3+4+7$.
*   **Option B:** Some will choose B because it looks like how they type it into a non-scientific calculator, unaware of BIDMAS errors.

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=10% D=10%
*   **The Over-Confidence:** These students have mastered the "include the zero" rule. They will look at A, see a denominator of 5, and immediately tick it.
*   **Calculation over logic:** They are less likely to fall for C, but they might still overlook the fact that 0 is missing from the numerator in Option A (even though adding 0 doesn't change the sum, the *calculation* structure is technically incomplete compared to the definition).

**advanced:** A=30% B=5% C=5% D=60%
*   **Attention to detail:** These students will notice that Option A technically omits the $+0$. While numerically the same, they may argue that "None of them" is the most rigorous answer because A is missing a term, and B is mathematically incorrect due to BIDMAS (only the 7 is divided by 5).
*   **The BIDMAS check:** They will immediately discard B because of the lack of brackets. 
*   **The 0 debate:** If they decide $1+3+4+7$ is a valid representation of the sum, they choose A. If they are taught strictly to follow the "sum of all data," they will choose D.

### Predicted Data Summary Table

| Ability Level | A (Omit 0 in sum) | B (BIDMAS Error) | C (Omit 0 in count) | D (Correct/Rigorous) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **below_basic** | 45% | 10% | 40% | 5% |
| **basic** | 60% | 15% | 20% | 5% |
| **proficient** | 75% | 5% | 10% | 10% |
| **advanced** | 30% | 5% | 5% | 60% |

**Teacher's Note:** This is a "trick" question. Mathematically, the value of (A) is the correct mean, but as a representation of the *process*, it is flawed. Advanced students often overthink whether the absence of "$+0$" makes the calculation "wrong." Most UK exam boards would accept A as the "correct" calculation in a multiple-choice context, but higher-ability students are trained to be suspicious of such omissions.
