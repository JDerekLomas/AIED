As a UK maths teacher, I would categorize these ability levels based on GCSE target grades (Foundation vs Higher) and their grasp of algebraic and directed number rules.

The specific "trap" in this question is twofold: the **negative $\times$ negative** rule and the **multiplication vs addition** confusion.

### Predicted Student Responses

| Ability Level | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** (Grade 1-2) | 15% | 35% | 10% | **40%** |
| **Basic** (Grade 3-4) | 35% | **45%** | 5% | 15% |
| **Proficient** (Grade 5-6) | **75%** | 20% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** (Grade 7-9) | **98%** | 2% | 0% | 0% |

### Teacher's Rationale and Analysis

#### **Below Basic: Focus on D (-5)**
At this level, students often struggle to distinguish between operations. When they see $-1$ and $-4$, their brain performs **addition** (e.g., "I owe £1, then I owe £4, so I owe £5"). They ignore the instruction "multiplies" in favor of the most intuitive visual combination of the digits. 

#### **Basic: Focus on B (-4)**
Students at this level understand that the instruction is to multiply ($1 \times 4 = 4$). However, they often fall into the "Common Negative" trap. They see negative signs and assume the answer must be negative. They have not yet solidified the "double negative makes a positive" rule for multiplication, often confusing it with adding negatives.

#### **Proficient: Focus on A (+4)**
These students have mastered the mechanics of FOIL/Grid Method and the rules of directed numbers. The majority will correctly identify that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive. The 20% choosing **B** are likely making "silly mistakes" under exam pressure or misreading the signs.

#### **Advanced: Focus on A (+4)**
For a Grade 7-9 student, this is a "check-and-move-on" question. Any errors here would be purely down to a visual lapse or misreading the question as asking for the sum of the constants rather than the product, though this is rare at this level.
