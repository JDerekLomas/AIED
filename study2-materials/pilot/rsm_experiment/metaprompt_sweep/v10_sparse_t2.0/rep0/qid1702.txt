As a UK maths teacher, I would analyse this question based on GCSE foundation and higher tiers. This question tests **substitution** and **solving two-step linear equations**, complicated by a decimal and a negative coefficient for $y$.

Here is the prediction of student responses by ability level:

**Below Basic (Grade 1-2)**
Students at this level struggle with the negative sign and the structure of the equation. Many will perform "reverse operations" incorrectly or simply try to combine the numbers seen in the question ($10, 6, 30$ and $0.5$) using basic arithmetic.
*   **A (4.25): 15%**
*   **B (-4.25): 10%**
*   **C (3.3): 45%** (Likely to do $30 \div 10 = 3$ and then "add" the $0.3$ because $0.6 \times 0.5$ is seen, or misinterpreting the decimal).
*   **D (2.7): 30%** (Miscalculating $30 - 3 = 27$ then failing to divide by 10, or general guessing).

**Basic (Grade 3-4)**
These students know to substitute $y = 0.5$ but often make an error with the negative sign (treating $-6y$ as $+6y$) or struggle with the decimal multiplication $6 \times 0.5$.
*   **A (3.3): 50%** (The most common error: $10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 33 \rightarrow x = 3.3$).
*   **B (-4.25): 10%** (Confusion with rearranging).
*   **C (4.25): 15%** (Incorrectly moving terms across the equals sign).
*   **D (2.7): 25%** (Thinking $10x + 3 = 30$, leading to $10x = 27$).

**Proficient (Grade 5-6)**
These students will substitute $0.5$ correctly and identify $6 \times 0.5 = 3$. They generally handle the inverse operations correctly but may still make a "sign error" when moving the $-3$ across the equals sign.
*   **A (3.3): 85%** (Correct working: $10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$).
*   **B (-4.25): 2%**
*   **C (4.25): 5%**
*   **D (2.7): 8%** (Occasional arithmetic error $30 - 3$ instead of $30 + 3$).

**Advanced (Grade 7+)**
These students treat this as a "one-mark" warm-up question. They are fluent in substituting and solving mentally or with minimal jottings.
*   **A (3.3): 98%**
*   **B (-4.25): 0%**
*   **C (4.25): 1%**
*   **D (2.7): 1%**

### Teacher's Summary Table:

| Ability Level | A (3.3) | B (-4.25) | C (4.25) | D (2.7) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 10% | 45% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 50% | 10% | 15% | 25% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 2% | 5% | 8% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 0% | 1% | 1% |

**The Correct Answer is C (Wait - Correction below)**
*Correction based on the Maths:*
1. Substitute $y=0.5$: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
2. Simplify: $10x - 3 = 30$
3. Add 3 to both sides: $10x = 33$
4. Divide by 10: **$x = 3.3$**

*Note: In the original prompt, A was listed as 4.
