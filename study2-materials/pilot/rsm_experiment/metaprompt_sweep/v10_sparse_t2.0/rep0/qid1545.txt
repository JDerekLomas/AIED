In the UK context, this question primarily tests **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction).

The mathematical reality is:
*   Left Side: $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = \mathbf{11}$
*   Right Side: $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$
*   Therefore, **$11 > 5$**, making **A** the correct answer.

Here is a prediction of Year 7–9 student responses by ability level:

### **below_basic**
*These students typically work left-to-right regardless of operators or equate "maths problems" as needing to be equal.*
*   **A=15% B=15% C=65% D=5%**
*   **Reasoning:** The most common error here is "additive equivalence" or simply guessing. Many will calculate the left side as $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$ (left-to-right) and see that it matches the right side, leading them firmly to **C**.

### **basic**
*These students have heard of BIDMAS but apply it inconsistently, often prioritizing Addition because it appears first in their mental "left-to-right" scan.*
*   **A=30% B=20% C=45% D=5%**
*   **Reasoning:** A large portion will still perform $8+12$ first on the left side, concluding $20 \div 4 = 5$ on both sides (Answer **C**). Those who correctly get 11 vs 5 often second-guess themselves because the numbers are the same on both sides.

### **proficient**
*These students generally follow BIDMAS but may make a "clerical" arithmetic error or confuse the $>$ and $<$ symbols.*
*   **A=75% B=10% C=10% D=5%**
*   **Reasoning:** Most will correctly identify that $8 + 3 = 11$ and $20 \div 4 = 5$. The small percentage choosing **B** usually understand the values but mix up the inequality signs (a common "L" shape confusion for Lesser than).

### **advanced**
*These students have mastered order of operations and rarely make sign errors.*
*   **A=96% B=2% C=1% D=1%**
*   **Reasoning:** High-ability students will instantly recognise the structure of the problem as a test of brackets. They may not even calculate the full values, simply recognising that $8 + \text{something}$ is significantly larger than $\frac{1}{4}$ of $(8+12)$. Mistakes here are usually due to extreme haste.
