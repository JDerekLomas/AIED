Here are the predicted response patterns for UK secondary students (typically Year 9 or 10) based on common misconceptions related to directed numbers and expansion.

**below_basic:** (Target Grade 1–2)
These students often struggle with the "sum and product" rules. Many will simply find the difference between 5 and 7 to get -2, or fail to apply the rule that a negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive.
*   **A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%**
*   *Common Error:* Selecting **A** because they do $7 - 5 = 2$ and attach the negative sign, or **D** because they see two minus signs and assume the final constant must be negative.

**basic:** (Target Grade 3–4)
Students at this level generally understand the FOIL or Grid method and can get the $m^2$ and $12m$ parts. Their main pitfall is the final constant $(-5 \times -7)$.
*   **A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%**
*   *Common Error:* Selecting **D** is the classic "Basic" error—they correctly add $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12m$, but conclude that a "negative" problem must end in a negative constant.

**proficient:** (Target Grade 5–6)
These students have mastered directed number multiplication rules. They are less likely to make sign errors but may occasionally rush and pick the wrong sign for the linear term.
*   **A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%**
*   *Outcome:* The majority will identify that $-5 + -7 = -12$ and $-5 \times -7 = +35$. Errors here are usually due to "examination slip" rather than lack of knowledge.

**advanced:** (Target Grade 7+)
High-achieving students will view this as a "one-look" question. 
*   **A=1% B=98% C=0% D=1%**
*   *Outcome:* Near-perfect accuracy. Any wrong answer is likely a misclick or a momentary lapse in concentration.
