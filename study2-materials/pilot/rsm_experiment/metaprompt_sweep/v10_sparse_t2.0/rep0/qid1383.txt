As a UK maths teacher, I see this specific question as a "trap" regarding BIDMAS/order of operations and the properties of negative indices.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses based on typical classroom performance levels:

**below_basic:** 
**A=10% B=45% C=10% D=35%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level often fail to recognise $k^4$ as index notation, instead treating it as $k \times 4$. They will perform $-3 \times 4$ to get $-12$ (Option D) or simply $3 \times 4$ and ignore the sign (Option B).

**basic:** 
**A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%**
*   **Reasoning:** These students know that $3^4 = 81$, but they struggle with the rules of powers of negative numbers. A common misconception at this level is that "if the base is negative, the answer must stay negative." They likely typed $-3^4$ into a non-scientific calculator or followed the visual cue of the minus sign without applying the "even power = positive result" rule.

**proficient:** 
**A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%**
*   **Reasoning:** Most students at this level have mastered the idea that a negative multiplied by a negative an even number of times results in a positive. However, a significant minority will still make a "reflex" error, choosing -81 because they see the negative in the question and don't pause to think about the expansion $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$.

**advanced:** 
**A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%**
*   **Reasoning:** GCSE Grade 7-9 students (Advanced) should get this correct almost every time. The only errors here would be "finger slips" on a calculator or misreading the power as a 3 ($k^3$). They are well-aware of the importance of brackets when substituting negative values.

**Teacher's Summary Table:**

| Level | A (81) | B (12) | C (-81) | D (-12) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **below_basic** | 10% | 45% | 10% | 35% |
| **basic** | 20% | 10% | 60% | 10% |
| **proficient** | 65% | 5% | 25% | 5% |
| **advanced** | 98% | 0% | 2% | 0% |
