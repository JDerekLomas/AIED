In the UK secondary curriculum (Key Stage 3/4), this question tests the ability to rearrange multi-step linear equations. Step 1 requires multiplying by the denominator ($15 \times 4 = 60$), and Step 2 requires subtracting 1 from both sides ($60 - 1 = 59$). 

Isaac's error is in **Step 2**, where he adds 1 instead of subtracting it. Therefore, the correct answer is **A (Only step 1)**.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic:** 
*These students struggle with the order of operations and inverse operations. Many will see "1" and "60" and intuitively add them, leading them to believe both steps are correct.*
*   **A=15% B=20% C=55% D=10%**

**basic:**
*Students at this level likely recognize that Step 1 is correct (multiplication). However, they frequently make "sign errors" or follow a gut feeling that 61 follows 60, making C a very common "distractor" choice.*
*   **A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%**

**proficient:**
*These students generally understand inverse operations. They will perform the mental check ($60 - 1$) and identify Isaac’s mistake in Step 2. Some may still rush and pick C, but the majority will identify Step 1 as the only valid move.*
*   **A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%**

**advanced:**
*Advanced students will solve the equation mentally in seconds. They will specifically look for the error in Step 2 and are unlikely to be tricked by the common addition error.*
*   **A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%**
