In a UK secondary school context (Key Stage 3 or GCSE), this question tests three distinct skills: **substitution**, **knowledge of BIDMAS** (indices before multiplication), and **decimal place value**.

The most common "distractor" in the UK curriculum is typically the result of performing multiplication before the exponent ($3 \times 0.3 = 0.9 \rightarrow 0.9^2 = 0.81$).

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic (Working towards Grade 2)**
*These students struggle with decimal multiplication and the order of operations. Many will multiply $3$ by $0.3$ first and then square it, or they may perform $3 \times 0.3$ and mistake it for the final answer.*
*   **A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%**
*   *Primary error:* Squaring $0.9$ (A) or confusing $x^2$ with $x \times 2$, leading to $3 \times 0.3 \times 2 = 1.8$ (C).

**basic (Grade 3-4)**
*Students at this level are aware of BIDMAS but frequently make mistakes when squaring decimals (thinking $0.3^2 = 0.9$).*
*   **A=25% B=40% C=15% D=20%**
*   *Primary error:* Squaring $0.3$ to get $0.09$ is difficult; many think $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. Then $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ (D). Alternatively, $3 \times 0.09$ is calculated as $0.27$ (B), but many get stuck at the decimal stage and guess A.

**proficient (Grade 5-6)**
*These students usually remember BIDMAS correctly. The hurdle here is specifically the decimal place value in $0.09 \times 3$.*
*   **A=10% B=70% C=5% D=15%**
*   *Primary error:* The majority will identify that $0.3^2 = 0.09$. Some will still slip up on the final multiplication and shift the decimal point one place too few (D).

**advanced (Grade 7+)**
*These students are fluent in decimal arithmetic and understand the priority of indices.*
*   **A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%**
*   *Logic:* $0.3^2 = 0.09$. Then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. Accuracy is very high at this level.

### Summary of Options
*   **A (0.81):** The "BIDMAS Trap" – did $(3x)^2$ instead of $3(x^2)$.
*   **B (0.27):** **Correct answer.**
*   **C (1.8):** The "Linear Trap" – calculated $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$.
*   **D (2.7):** The "Decimal Trap" – calculated $0.3^2$ as $0.9$, then multiplied by $3$.
