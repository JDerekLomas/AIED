In the UK context, this question assesses knowledge of **multiplicative inverses (reciprocals)** and **directed number rules**. 

Common misconceptions usually involve either "flipping" the fraction but forgetting the sign, or confusing the operation with addition (looking for the additive inverse).

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic:** 
*These students struggle with the concept of a reciprocal and often pick the same number or its positive counterpart.*
**A=15% B=15% C=35% D=35%**
*   **Analysis:** High weighting on C and D. Students often think "to make it 1, it needs to be the same number" or "it needs to be the opposite sign of the same number." They rarely understand that a fraction must be inverted to result in 1.

**basic:**
*These students likely know they need to "flip" the fraction, but the "minus times minus equals plus" rule is a major stumbling block.*
**A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%**
*   **Analysis:** A is the "distractor of death" here. Students recognize the reciprocal ($4/3$) but erroneously think that because the answer is negative (-1), the star must be positive. They haven't mastered that two negatives produce a positive.

**proficient:**
*These students have a solid grasp of reciprocals and are beginning to apply sign rules more consistently.*
**A=20% B=65% C=10% D=5%**
*   **Analysis:** The majority identify the reciprocal ($4/3$) and apply the rule that a negative must be multiplied by a positive to remain negative. They correctly identify that $(-) \times (+) = (-)$.

**advanced:**
*These students can perform the algebraic manipulation ($x = -1 \div -3/4$) mentally or immediately recognise the property of reciprocals.*
**A=5% B=92% C=2% D=1%**
*   **Analysis:** Errors at this level are usually "slips" or rushing. Most will immediately see that $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1$.
