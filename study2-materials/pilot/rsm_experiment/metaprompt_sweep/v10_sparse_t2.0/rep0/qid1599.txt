In the UK secondary curriculum, this question assesses a student's understanding of **Algebraic Notation** (writing division as a fraction) and the **Order of Operations** (preserving the bracketed grouping).

Below are the predicted response patterns across ability levels (Working Towards, Expected, and Exceeding targets).

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic (Working Towards Grade 1/2)**
*These students struggle with the visual translation from a linear operation to a vertical fraction. They often choose B because they see two symbols on the right side of the division sign and assume "everything needs more detail," or C because they process the equation left-to-right and ignore the significance of the brackets.*
**A=25% B=30% C=35% D=10%**

**basic (Working Towards Grade 3/4)**
*These students recognize that a fraction bar represents division. However, many will pick C, demonstrating a "procedural superficiality" where they divide the first two terms they see and simply append the '+ 4'. Option D is a common 'order error' where they know it's a fraction but swap the numerator and denominator.*
**A=45% B=10% C=30% D=15%**

**proficient (Working Towards Grade 5/6)**
*These students are secure with the convention that the numerator is the dividend and the denominator is the divisor. Most will correctly identify that the brackets group $h+4$ together under the fraction bar. A small percentage may still get tripped up by the "top-heavy" look of a long denominator and opt for D.*
**A=75% B=5% C=10% D=10%**

**advanced (Working Towards Grade 7+)**
*At this level, students see the expression $h+4$ as a single unit (a binomial). The translation from $\div$ to a fraction bar is automatic. Errors here are rare and usually attributed to haste rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.*
**A=94% B=1% C=3% D=2%**

### Teacher Analysis of Distractors:
*   **A (Correct):** Shows division as a fraction and maintains the grouping.
*   **B (Misconception):** Adding 'ghost' terms—students often feel algebra needs to look "symmetrical" or balanced.
*   **C (BIDMAS/Order of Ops error):** The most common mistake. Students ignore the brackets and assume $c$ is only being divided by $h$.
*   **D (Inverse error):** Misunderstanding which term is the divisor. A common issue for students who struggle with the phrase "divided by."
