Here is the predicted response data based on typical misconceptions seen in UK Key Stage 3 and GCSE classrooms.

**The Correct Answer is B (\(4 \frac{19}{20}\)).**

### **Predictions by Ability Level**

**below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=30% D=45%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level often follow the "Add the Tops, Add the Bottoms" strategy for fractions. They will add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and then simply add $7+1$ and $10+4$ to get $4 \frac{8}{14}$ (**Option D**). **Option C** is also a high attractor as it shows a failure to find a common denominator (often just multiplying denominators and numerators across).

**basic: A=20% B=35% C=15% D=30%**
*   **Reasoning:** Many students at this level have been taught to convert to improper fractions first to "be safe" ($\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4}$). They may successfully reach $\frac{99}{20}$, but because the question asks for a mixed number, they fail at the final hurdle or assume **Option A** (the improper equivalent) must be the intended answer. A significant number will still fall for the "Add the Tops/Bottoms" trap of **Option D**.

**proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%**
*   **Reasoning:** Proficient students (Grade 4/5) generally know to find a common denominator of 20. Most will add the whole numbers separately ($4$) and the fractions ($14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20$). Errors usually occur when they convert to improper fractions and make a basic arithmetic slip in the multiplication or addition (leading to **Option A**).

**advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students working at Grade 7+ rarely struggle with the concept. They will almost exclusively reach **Option B**. The few who choose **Option A** usually do so by misreading the final instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number.

### **Teacher Analysis of Distractors**
*   **A ($\frac{99}{20}$):** The "Calculation correct, format wrong" trap. Tests if the student follows the specific constraint of the question (Mixed Number).
*   **C ($\frac{99}{40}$):** The "Double Denominator" error. Often happens when students multiply the denominators ($10 \times 4$) but forget to adjust numerators correctly, or mistakenly think they need to add the denominators after finding a common one.
*   **D ($4 \frac{8}{14}$):** The classic "Naive Addition" error. Whole + Whole, Top + Top, Bottom + Bottom. This is the most common misconception in UK schools for lower-attaining groups.
