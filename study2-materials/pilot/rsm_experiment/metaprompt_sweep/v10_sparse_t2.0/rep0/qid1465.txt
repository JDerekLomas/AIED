In the UK secondary school context, this question tests two distinct skills: **Order of Operations (BIDMAS)** and **Directed Numbers (Arithmetic with Negatives)**.

The correct calculation is: $3 - 5 + (4 \times 2) = 3 - 5 + 8 = 6$.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level:

### **below_basic:** A=10% B=30% C=20% D=40%
*   **Analysis:** These students almost never use BIDMAS instinctively. They will work strictly left-to-right: $3-5 = -2$; then $-2+4 = 2$; then $2 \times 2 = 4$ (**B**).
*   Many will struggle with the negative transition in $3-5$, leading them to calculate $5-3=2$, then $2+4=6$, then $6 \times 2 = 12$. If they see -12 or -10, they may guess **D** because "take away" often suggests a negative result to them.

### **basic:** A=35% B=45% C=10% D=10%
*   **Analysis:** Most students at this level have heard of BIDMAS but apply it incorrectly or "partially."
*   **The "Left-to-Right" Trap:** A huge portion will still calculate $3-5+4$ first, then multiply by 2, resulting in **B**.
*   **The "Addition before Subtraction" Trap:** Some believe 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS strictly. They do $5+4=9$, then $3-9 = -6$, then $-6 \times 2 = -12$ (**C**), though the multiplication usually pulls them back to the start.
*   Those who get **A** likely did the multiplication first ($8$) but then guessed or stumbled through the $3-5+8$ part.

### **proficient:** A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%
*   **Analysis:** Proficient students (Grade 4/5) know to do $4 \times 2 = 8$ first.
*   The primary error here isn't the order of operations, but the directed number calculation. After getting $3-5+8$, they might do $3-5 = -2$, then $-2+8 = 6$ (**A**).
*   The 15% who choose **B** are those who defaulted to left-to-right arithmetic under the pressure of a timed multiple-choice quiz.

### **advanced:** A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
*   **Analysis:** For advanced students (Grade 7+), this is a "check-your-work" question. They recognize the BIDMAS trap instantly.
*   Any errors here are "slips" (computational brain-farts) rather than a lack of conceptual understanding. They are very unlikely to choose D or C.
