In the context of the UK curriculum (GCSE Foundation/Higher), this question tests the understanding of **order of operations in inverse calculations**. 

Students often struggle with "floating" terms. Tom’s method follows the standard "BIDMAS in reverse" (undoing the subtraction first), while Katie’s method represents a common misconception regarding how to multiply through a term-led equation.

### **Predicted Student Responses**

| Ability Level | A (Only Tom) | B (Only Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 45% | 25% | 10% |
| **Basic** | 40% | 20% | 35% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 75% | 5% | 18% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 94% | 1% | 5% | 0% |

### **Teacher Insight / Analysis of Mistakes**

*   **Below Basic (Grade 1–2):** These students often have a "compulsion to calculate." They see the $3$ and the $12$ and assume multiplying them ($36$) is the first priority regardless of structure. They choose **B** because it looks like a "quick fix" to the fraction.
*   **Basic (Grade 3–4):** This group is split. Many have been taught to "add 5 to both sides" as the golden rule, leading them to Tom (**A**). However, a significant portion will fall for the trap of **C**, believing that in math, you can simply choose which part of the equation to "move" first without affecting the balance of the whole side.
*   **Proficient (Grade 5–6):** Most will correctly identify Tom as being right. The "Both" (**C**) option remains the strongest distractor here. Students at this level might think Katie is "partially right" but just forgot the 5, or they may mistake the equation for $\frac{x-5}{3}=12$, where Katie *would* be correct.
*   **Advanced (Grade 7–9):** These students recognize that Katie has failed to multiply the constant ($-5$) by $3$. They understand that for Katie’s line to be correct, the entire left side would need to be over the denominator of $3$. They will almost universally choose **A**.

**The Correct Answer is A.**  
*Tom correctly added 5 to both sides. Katie multiplied by 3 but failed to multiply the -5 by 3 (which should have resulted in $x-15=36$).*
