In the context of the UK curriculum (GCSE Higher Tier), this question tests **changing the subject of a formula** involving powers and roots. The most common error is mismanaging the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ during the division phase.

Here is the prediction of student responses by ability level:

**below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%**
*   **Reasoning:** These students often struggle to recall the volume of a sphere formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. Many will choose **A** because they see all the "correct" numbers and symbols and assume they should be multiplied together. Others choose **D** because they attempt a square root or simply guess based on the visual arrangement.

**basic: A=20% B=45% C=25% D=10%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level usually recall or look up the formula. However, they frequently make errors when dividing by a fraction. They often "move" the 3 to the denominator (choosing **B**) instead of multiplying $V$ by 3. **B** is a very common distractor for students who know they need a cube root but fail the algebraic manipulation.

**proficient: A=5% B=15% C=75% D=5%**
*   **Reasoning:** These students (aiming for Grade 6/7) are comfortable with the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. They correctly identify that to isolate $r^3$, they must multiply by 3 and divide by $4\pi$. The majority will land on **C**, though a small percentage may still get caught by the "3 on the bottom" trap of option B if working too quickly.

**advanced: A=1% B=2% C=96% D=1%**
*   **Reasoning:** Grade 8/9 students will find this a standard "rearranging formulae" task. They are less likely to be tricked by the fractional coefficient. They will perform the steps $3V = 4\pi r^3 \Rightarrow \frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$ mentally and select **C** almost instantly.

**Correct Answer: C**
