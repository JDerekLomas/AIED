In the UK secondary curriculum, these problems test two specific concepts: **Left-to-Right Associativity** for addition/subtraction, and **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)**.

**The Correct Answer is B.**

### Pedagogical Context for Predictors:
*   **Problem P Trap:** Many students are taught "Addition before Subtraction" because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS. This is a common misconception; they should be done left-to-right. Therefore, many students across all levels incorrectly pick **D**.
*   **Problem Q Trap:** Lower-ability students often work strictly left-to-right regardless of operators, leading them to **A**.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic:** (Targeting KS3 Stage 3/4 or Foundation Tier GCSE)
*Often ignore BIDMAS entirely or find the acronym confusing. Most will calculate purely left-to-right for both problems.*
**A=65% B=10% C=15% D=10%**

**basic:** (Targeting Grade 3/4 GCSE)
*Starting to apply BIDMAS for multiplication (Problem Q) but almost always fall into the "Addition before Subtraction" trap for Problem P because they follow the letters of the acronym literally.*
**A=15% B=30% C=10% D=45%**

**proficient:** (Targeting Grade 5/6 GCSE)
*Understand that multiplication comes first. However, the "Addition before Subtraction" misconception is remarkably persistent even at this level.*
**A=5% B=55% C=5% D=35%**

**advanced:** (Targeting Grade 7-9 GCSE or A-Level)
*Aware that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be handled left-to-right. They recognize the "BIDMAS Trap."*
**A=2% B=92% C=1% D=5%**

### Key Summary for Teachers:
The high percentage for **D** in the mid-tiers is the "BIDMAS Trap." Students think they are being clever by remembering the acronym, not realising that A and S are equal priority. **B** is the only mathematically correct answer.
