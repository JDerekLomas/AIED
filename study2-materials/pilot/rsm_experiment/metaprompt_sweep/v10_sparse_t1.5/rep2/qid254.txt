As a UK maths teacher, I would expect the following distribution of responses based on typical misconceptions regarding the number zero, the order of operations (BIDMAS), and the formula for the mean.

### Teacher’s Analysis of Misconceptions:
*   **A (The Correct Process):** Students recognise that 0 must be included in the count of numbers ($n=5$) but doesn't change the sum.
*   **B (The Calculator/BIDMAS error):** Students know to add them and divide by 5, but do not understand that a linear string calculation without brackets leads to only the 7 being divided (BIDMAS).
*   **C (The "Zero Doesn't Count" error):** A very common misconception where students believe 0 "doesn't count" and therefore divide by 4.
*   **D (The Over-thinker):** Students who think that because "0" isn't written in the numerator of Option A, it is technically incorrect.

### Predicted Responses

**below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=55% D=10%**
*At this level, the most dominant misconception is that 0 is "nothing," so the mean is calculated as the sum of the non-zero digits divided by four. Many will also pick B because it looks like a standard calculation string.*

**basic: A=35% B=20% C=35% D=10%**
*Students at this level are often split. They are starting to remember that the "count" includes all numbers in the set, but the visual pull of four non-zero numbers often leads them to choose C.*

**proficient: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%**
*Proficient students (typically aiming for a Grade 4/5 at GCSE) usually understand that the denominator must be 5. Some might still be tripped up by the BIDMAS trap of Option B or the absence of the "0" in the numerator of Option A.*

**advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%**
*Advanced students will immediately identify that adding 0 is identity-neutral, so $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$ is equivalent to $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$. They will spot the BIDMAS error in B instantly.*
