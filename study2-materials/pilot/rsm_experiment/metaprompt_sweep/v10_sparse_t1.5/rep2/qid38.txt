Here is a prediction of student performance based on typical UK Key Stage 4 (GCSE) cohorts.

**The Correct Answer is A.**

### Predicted Responses by Ability Level

**below_basic: A=15% B=50% C=10% D=25%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level frequently apply the "add across" misconception for all fractions. 
    *   **B** is the most popular distractor because they add the numerators ($3+4=7$) and the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). 
    *   **D** is chosen by those who recognize $2x$ as a common denominator but fail to adjust the second numerator.

**basic: A=35% B=30% C=10% D=25%**
*   **Reasoning:** These students (typically targeting a Grade 4) are beginning to remember that denominators must be the same. 
    *   Many will still fall for **B** out of habit. 
    *   Many will choose **D** because they identify the common denominator of $2x$ but simply add the original numerators ($3+4$) without doubling the $4$.
    *   **A** is reached by those who remember to "multiply the top and bottom of the second fraction by 2."

**proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students targeting Grades 6-7 usually have a solid grasp of equivalent fractions.
    *   The most common error here is a "silly mistake" represented by **D**, where they correctly identify the denominator but forget to scale the second numerator.
    *   They rarely "add across" (B), as this rule is well-drilled by this stage.

**advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%**
*   **Reasoning:** Grade 8-9 students see this as a foundational skill. 
    *   Errors at this level are almost exclusively down to extreme "exam fatigue" or misreading the question. 
    *   **C** might be an occasional error if they mistakenly "cancel" an $x$ or try to multiply both sides by $x$ as if it were an equation.

### Teacher's Note on Distractors:
*   **A (Correct):** $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$
*   **B (The "Freshman Error"):** $\frac{3+4}{2x+x} = \frac{7}{3x}$
*   **C (Numerator double-counting):** Doubling both numerators or failing to treat the common denominator correctly.
*   **D (The "Half-way" error):** Finding the common denominator $2x$ but forgetting to multiply the $4$ by $2$.
