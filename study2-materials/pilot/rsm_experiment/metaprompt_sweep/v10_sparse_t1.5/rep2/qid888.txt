Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical UK secondary school performance levels (Key Stage 3/4).

**Key misconceptions being tested:**
*   **A:** Difference between the terms ($7 - 5 = 2$) rather than the sum ($7 + 5 = 12$).
*   **B:** Correct application of the "double negative" rule and correct addition.
*   **C:** Ignoring the negative signs during the addition/linear phase.
*   **D:** Multiplication error (forgetting that $-5 \times -7 = +35$).

### **below_basic**
*Students at this level often guess based on "familiar" numbers or ignore sign rules entirely. They may subtract the two constants to get the middle term and guess the sign of the final constant.*
**A=40% B=15% C=25% D=20%**

### **basic**
*Students are likely using FOIL or the Grid Method but frequently trip up on directed numbers (integers). Many will correctly add $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$, but will fail the $-5 \times -7$ multiplication, choosing a negative 35.*
**A=15% B=30% C=20% D=35%**

### **proficient**
*Students are confident with the expansion process. Most will get the correct signs for the $-12m$. The most common remaining error is a momentary lapse in concentration regarding the $+35$ (negative times a negative).*
**A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%**

### **advanced**
*Students have mastered quadratic expansion and the rules of directed numbers. Errors at this level are usually rare "silly mistakes" (clerical errors).*
**A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%**
