As a UK maths teacher, I would categorize this question (rearranging and substituting into a linear equation) as a typical **Foundation Tier GCSE** or **Higher Tier Grade 4** task. 

The main "distractor" here is the handling of the negative sign and the division by 10.
**Correct calculation:** 
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$ **(Option C)**

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level:

**below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=20% D=30%**
*   **A is the most popular choice here:** Students often struggle with the "minus" in the equation. They see $10x - 3 = 30$ and perform $30 - 3$ to get $27$, then divide by $10$ to get $2.7$, but then somehow pivot to 4.25 by adding 6 and 0.5 then dividing. Or, more commonly, they try to add 6 and 30 ($36$) then divide by $10$ ($3.6$) but guess A because it "looks" like a coordinate calculation.
*   **D** is a very common error: $10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 27$ (subtracting 3 instead of adding it).

**basic: A=25% B=10% C=40% D=25%**
*   Students at this level are comfortable substituting $0.5$ to get $3$.
*   However, many will make the "inverse operation" error: $10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 27 \Rightarrow x = 2.7$ (**Choice D**).
*   Choice **C** begins to emerge as they remember to "add 3" to the other side.

**proficient: A=10% B=5% C=75% D=10%**
*   Most students here will successfully navigate the two-step equation $10x - 3 = 30$.
*   The small percentage choosing **D** is due to a "silly mistake" with the negative sign. 
*   **A** remains a minor distractor for those who substitute $0.5$ for $x$ instead of $y$ by mistake ($5 - 6y = 30 \rightarrow -6y = 25 \rightarrow y \approx -4.16$), then panic and pick the closest positive value.

**advanced: A=2% B=1% C=96% D=1%**
*   Students at this level will perform the algebraic manipulation mentally or via quick jotting with very high accuracy.
*   The rare incorrect answers are usually "transcription errors" (misreading the numbers in the table).
