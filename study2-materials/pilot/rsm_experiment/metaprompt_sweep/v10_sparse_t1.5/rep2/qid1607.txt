As a UK maths teacher, I would categorize these ability levels based on GCSE target grades (Foundation vs. Higher tier) and their typical understanding of inverse operations and "balancing" an equation.

The error in Step 2 is a classic "sign change" or "operation confusion" mistake. While Isaac correctly multiplied by 4 in Step 1, he added 1 in Step 2 instead of subtracting it.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic (Target Grade 1-2)**
*Students at this level often struggle with multi-step processes and may guess based on the final answer "looking right" or because they see "correct-looking" numbers (60 and 61).*
*   **A: 25%**
*   **B: 15%**
*   **C: 50%** (The most common guess; they see Step 1 is right and assume the rest follows.)
*   **D: 10%**

**basic (Target Grade 3-4)**
*These students can usually identify that $15 \times 4 = 60$, but they often make "sign errors." Many will see $60 = 1 + k$ and reflexively add the 1 to the 60 to get 61, confirming Step 2 as "correct" in their minds.*
*   **A: 35%**
*   **B: 10%**
*   **C: 45%** (High percentage of students will fall for the additive error.)
*   **D: 10%**

**proficient (Target Grade 5-6)**
*These students are more rigorous. Most will spot that the $+1$ requires a $-1$ to solve. However, under exam pressure, a small margin will still overlook the sign error in Step 2.*
*   **A: 70%** (Correct answer)
*   **B: 5%**
*   **C: 20%**
*   **D: 5%**

**advanced (Target Grade 7-9)**
*Fluency in algebra is high here. They will instantly identify the inverse operation of $+1$ as $-1$ and likely solve the equation mentally before even looking at Isaac's steps.*
*   **A: 94%** (Correct answer)
*   **B: 1%**
*   **C: 3%**
*   **D: 2%**

### Teacher's Note on Common Misconceptions:
*   **The "Move and Change" Myth:** Students who are taught to "move the 1 to the other side and change the sign" often forget which sign to change or whether to add or subtract.
*   **Verification:** Advanced students are more likely to check the answer by substituting 61 back into the original equation ($\frac{62}{4} \neq 15$), whereas Below Basic students rarely verify their solutions.
