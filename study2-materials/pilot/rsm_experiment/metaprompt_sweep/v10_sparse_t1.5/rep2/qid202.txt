Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical UK secondary school performance data and common misconceptions encountered in the classroom.

**below_basic:** 
*Likely to add the numerators and the denominators separately or ignore the whole numbers entirely.*
*   **A=15%** (May get it right by luck/intuition)
*   **B=10%** (Converting to improper fractions is usually too complex for this level)
*   **C=35%** (Adds the numerators and denominators: $2+1=3$ [ignored], $1+2=3$, $5+5=10$)
*   **D=40%** (Adds whole numbers $2+1=3$, adds numerators $1+2=3$, adds denominators $5+5=10$. This is the "classic" error at this level.)

**basic:**
*Can handle basic fractions but often trips up on the "keep the denominator" rule or misreads the final format requirement.*
*   **A=45%** (Starts to understand the denominator stays the same)
*   **B=10%** (Calculation correct, but fails to see it is an improper fraction)
*   **C=10%** (Starting to move away from this error)
*   **D=35%** (The most common "persisting" error: adding the denominators)

**proficient:**
*Strong grasp of the algorithm. Main errors come from rushing or failing to read the specific instruction "leave as a mixed number".*
*   **A=80%** (Standard successful application of the rule)
*   **B=15%** (Calculates correctly but converts to improper fraction, perhaps out of habit for harder addition questions)
*   **C=2%** (Rare error for this level)
*   **D=3%** (Occasional "brain fade" error)

**advanced:**
*Near-perfect accuracy. Errors are usually due to pure clerical slips (reading 1/5 as 2/5).*
*   **A=96%** (Correct answer)
*   **B=3%** (Over-complicating by converting to improper first and forgetting to convert back)
*   **C=0%** (Fundamental misunderstanding not present)
*   **D=1%** (Very rare "silly" mistake)

**Key Teacher Insights:**
*   **The "D" Trap:** For *Below Basic* and *Basic* students, adding the denominators ($5+5=10$) is the single most common distractor. 
*   **The "B" Trap:** *Proficient* students are often taught to convert everything to improper fractions to solve more difficult addition ($e.g. 2\frac{1}{3} + 1\frac{3}{4}$). Because of this "procedural heavy" teaching, they may provide option B and lose the mark because they didn't convert back to a mixed number as requested.
