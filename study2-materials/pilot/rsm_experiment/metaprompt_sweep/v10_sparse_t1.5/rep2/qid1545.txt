In the UK context (KS3/KS4), this question primarily tests **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction).

The correct mathematical derivation is:
*   Left Side: $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = \mathbf{11}$
*   Right Side: $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$
*   Therefore: $11 > 5$. Correct Answer: **A**.

Here is the prediction of student responses by ability level:

**below_basic:** A=25% B=15% C=55% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** These students rarely apply BIDMAS. They tend to read left-to-right. Left side: $8+12=20, 20 \div 4 = 5$. Right side: $8+12=20, 20 \div 4 = 5$. Because both calculations look the same to them, they overwhelmingly choose **C**.

**basic:** A=40% B=15% C=40% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level have heard of BIDMAS but apply it inconsistently. Many will calculate the right side correctly (because of the brackets) but will still calculate the left side left-to-right, leading them back to $5 = 5$. The "A" votes come from those who remember to divide first on the left but might make a mental arithmetic error.

**proficient:** A=75% B=10% C=10% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** Most students at this level automatically apply BIDMAS. The 25% error margin accounts for "speed errors" where they see the same numbers and assume equality, or mistakenly think the brackets on the right make that side "bigger" because they are performed first.

**advanced:** A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
*   **Reasoning:** These students identify the structure of the problem immediately. The tiny margin for error represents rare clerical slips. They recognise that $8 + 3$ is obviously larger than $20 \div 4$ without needing to write it down.
