In the UK secondary curriculum (Key Stage 3/4), this question tests three distinct skills: term identification (recognizing the negative sign belongs to the number), operation selection (multiplication vs. addition), and integer rules (negative $\times$ negative).

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level:

| Ability Level | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 30% | 15% | 35% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 25% | 5% | 25% |
| **Proficient** | 80% | 15% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0% | 1% |

### Teacher's Rationale and Error Analysis:

*   **Below Basic (Low Progress / Foundation Tier):**
    These students struggle with the concept of "expanding" vs "simplifying." A common mistake here is **additive thinking**; they see $-1$ and $-4$ and mentally combine them to get $-5$ (D). They may also simply "join" the numbers together, ignoring the signs, or choose -4 (B) because they don't yet grasp that the negative signs cancel out during multiplication.

*   **Basic (Mid-Foundation Tier):**
    These students recognize that brackets involve multiplication. However, their grasp of **Directed Numbers (Integers)** is shaky. Many will correctly identify $1 \times 4 = 4$, but will assume a "negative and a negative make a negative" (a very common misconception) or simply forget to carry the negative from the first bracket, leading them to B.

*   **Proficient (Higher Tier / Grade 5-6):**
    These students have been drilled in "FOIL" or the "Grid Method." They know the Last terms involve multiplying $-1 \times -4$. The most likely error here is a "slip" where they get the sign wrong (B), but the majority will confidently arrive at A.

*   **Advanced (Targeting Grade 8-9):**
    These students treat this as a trivial step. If they get it wrong, it is likely a misread of the question (e.g., adding instead of multiplying) rather than a lack of conceptual understanding. They are highly unlikely to choose C or D.
