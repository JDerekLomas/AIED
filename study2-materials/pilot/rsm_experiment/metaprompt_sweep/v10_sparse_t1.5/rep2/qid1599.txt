As a UK maths teacher, I would expect to see the following distribution. This question tests the understanding of the horizontal fraction bar as a grouping symbol (replacing brackets) and the non-commutative nature of division (order matters).

**Teacher’s Analysis:**
*   **A is correct.**
*   **B** is a "copy-paste" error where students assume digits from the operation (4) should appear in both numerator and denominator.
*   **C** is a BIDMAS/Order of Operations error, where the student fails to realise the fraction bar must cover the whole expression $(h+4)$.
*   **D** is the classic "division is commutative" error, where the student knows it becomes a fraction but puts the terms the wrong way around.

**below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=25% D=30%**
*At this level, responses are almost random. Many will choose D because "the bigger bit looks better on the bottom" or because they simply reverse the order. C is very common because they see "c ÷ h" and just "tack on" the +4.*

**basic: A=55% B=5% C=15% D=25%**
*Students at 'basic' level recognise that division becomes a fraction. However, a significant number will still struggle with the orientation (D) or fail to understand that the bracketed expression must remain together under the bar (C).*

**proficient: A=85% B=2% C=5% D=8%**
*These students are secure with algebraic notation. The small percentage of errors usually comes from rushing and picking D (reversing the dividend and divisor) or a momentary lapse in BIDMAS logic (C).*

**advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%**
*Advanced students view $c$ as the numerator and $(h+4)$ as a single entity (the denominator) instantly. Errors here are almost exclusively due to misreading the question or accidental clicking/circling.*
