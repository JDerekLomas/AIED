Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical UK Year 9/10 (KS3/KS4) attainment data and common misconceptions regarding linear equations and substitution.

### Teacher Analysis of Options:
*   **A (20):** Confusion with operations. Student may see $4+2+4+10$ or incorrectly multiply the constants together ($2 \times 10$).
*   **B (3):** The value for the next cell in the table ($x=1$). This is a common "distractor" for students who don't read the table headers and try to solve for $y$ when $x=1$ (i.e., $4(1) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 6 \rightarrow y=3$).
*   **C (5):** **The Correct Answer.** Substitution of $x=0$ results in $2y=10$, so $y=5$.
*   **D (2.5):** Incorrectly dividing the total (10) by the coefficient of $x$ (4), or a misunderstanding of the relationship between 10, 4, and 2.

### Predicted Responses

**below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%**
Students at this level often guess based on the numbers visible in the equation. Many will see "4", "2", and "10" and pick **A** (20) or **D** (2.5) via arbitrary calculation. Their understanding of "substitution" is weak; they may ignore the $x=0$ instruction entirely.

**basic: A=10% B=40% C=35% D=15%**
This group understands they need to "do something" with the table. A very common mistake here is finding the value for the *wrong* column. They might solve for $x=1$ because they assume the "star" isn't the starting point, or they might struggle to handle the $0$. **B** is a high-probability distractor here.

**proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%**
Students at the "expected standard" (Grade 4/5) usually handle substitution well, especially when $x=0$ because it eliminates one term. The main errors here are usually "slip" errors or misreading the question as $x+y=...$ rather than $4x+2y=...$

**advanced: A=1% B=2% C=96% D=1%**
At this level (Grade 7+), $x=0$ is recognized immediately as the y-intercept. They will mentally cover the $4x$ term and solve $2y=10$ almost instantaneously. Errors are extremely rare and usually down to extreme rushing.
