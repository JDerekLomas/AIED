In the UK secondary context (KS4/GCSE), this question tests the ability to recall the volume of a sphere formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) and successfully rearrange it to make $r$ the subject.

The most common errors involve incorrect algebraic manipulation (multiplying by the numerator instead of the denominator) and a lack of familiarity with the cube root notation.

**below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=15% D=20%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level often do not know the formula. Option **A** is the most popular guess because it "multiplies everything together," which feels like a standard volume calculation. Option **D** is chosen by those who think the 3 and 4 stay in their original vertical positions regardless of the side of the equation.

**basic: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%**
*   **Reasoning:** These students (Grade 4/5) usually recall the formula but struggle with the two-step rearrangement ($V \div \frac{4}{3}$). Many will correctly move the $\pi$ (leading to **B**) but will multiply by $4$ and divide by $3$ out of habit, essentially performing the inverse operations in the wrong order.

**proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level (Grade 6/7) can reliably rearrange the formula. They recognise that to isolate $r^3$, they must multiply by $3$ and divide by $4\pi$. The most common mistake here is a "slip of the pen" where the $\pi$ stays on top (**B**) or they fail to include the whole fraction under the radical.

**advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%**
*   **Reasoning:** Higher-tier students (Grade 8/9) see this as a routine "change of subject" task. Errors are negligible and usually down to misreading the options. They instantly look for the $3V$ and $4\pi$ pairing as the inverse of $\frac{4}{3}\pi$.
