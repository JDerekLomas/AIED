As a UK Maths teacher, I see this specific question as a classic "distractor trap" involving negative bases and index laws. This typically appears on a Foundation Paper (GCSE) or as an introductory substitution question at Key Stage 3.

The key misconceptions here are:
1.  **Confusion between multiplication and powers** (e.g., $(-3) \times 4 = -12$).
2.  **The "Negative sign" error**: Forgetting that an even power of a negative number results in a positive value.
3.  **Calculator Input Error**: Typing $-3^4$ into a scientific calculator without brackets (which gives $-81$).

Here is the predicted distribution:

**below_basic:** (Targeting Grade 1/2)
*Students often confuse the operation required. They likely see '3' and '4' and perform basic multiplication.*
**A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%**
*Reasoning: Most will calculate $3 \times 4$ or $-3 \times 4$. D is popular because they see the negative sign and include it in their multiplication.*

**basic:** (Targeting Grade 3/4)
*Students understand that it means $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$, but they struggle with the sign or make a calculation error.*
**A=25% B=15% C=50% D=10%**
*Reasoning: Many will correctly compute 81 but believe that "if the input is negative, the answer must stay negative." Option C is the highest distractor here.*

**proficient:** (Targeting Grade 5/6)
*Students generally know how indices work, but some will be caught out by the "calculator logic" or the rule for even powers.*
**A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%**
*Reasoning: The majority get it right, but a significant minority will still pick C, either by misremembering the rule "even power = positive" or by relying on a mental model of $-3^4$.*

**advanced:** (Targeting Grade 7+)
*These students are fluent in substitution and index laws.*
**A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%**
*Reasoning: High-ability students recognize $(-3)^4 = (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$. The 5% error rate usually accounts for "silly mistakes" or over-thinking the notation.*
