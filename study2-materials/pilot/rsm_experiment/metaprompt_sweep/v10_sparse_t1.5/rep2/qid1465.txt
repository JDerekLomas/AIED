In the UK secondary mathematics context, this question tests two distinct skills: application of **BIDMAS** (Order of Operations) and fluency with **directed numbers** (negative integers).

The correct calculation is: $3 - 5 + (4 \times 2) = 3 - 5 + 8 = 6$.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level:

**below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%**
*   **Rationale:** These students almost always work strictly left-to-right, ignoring BIDMAS rules entirely. They calculate $(3-5) = -2$, then $(-2+4) = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = \mathbf{4}$ (**Option B**). A significant portion will also struggle with the negative number addition, often doing $3-5=2$, then $2+4=6$, then $6 \times 2 = \mathbf{12}$ (represented by distractors C and D via sign errors).

**basic: A=25% B=45% C=15% D=15%**
*   **Rationale:** Students at this level have heard of BIDMAS but often misapply it. Many "over-index" on the "A" coming before "S", incorrectly thinking they must add before they subtract ($5+8=13$, then $3-13 = \mathbf{-10}$, **Option D**). However, the "left-to-right" intuition is still strongest here, leading the majority to **Option B**.

**proficient: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%**
*   **Rationale:** These students know to multiply first to get $8$. The main hurdle is the subsequent calculation $3 - 5 + 8$. Most will successfully navigate this to get **6 (Option A)**. Those who fail here usually do so because they mistakenly add the $5$ and $8$ first due to the "A before S" mnemonic trap, leading back to **Option D**.

**advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%**
*   **Rationale:** Advanced students (targeting Grades 7-9 at GCSE) recognise that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and understand the term-based structure of the expression. They will correctly perform the multiplication first and handle the directed numbers without issue. Errors here are usually due to extreme haste rather than lack of knowledge.
