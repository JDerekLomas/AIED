In the context of the UK National Curriculum, this question tests two distinct skills: understanding the **order of operations (BIDMAS)** and **squaring decimals**. 

The correct calculation is $y = 3 \times (0.3^2) = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic (Working at KS3 Stage 3 or Grade 1/2 GCSE)**
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level often conflate $3x^2$ with $(3x)^2$ or simply multiply all visible numbers. Many struggle with the place value of $0.3 \times 0.3$.
*   **Primary Distractors:** **A** (calculating $0.9^2$) or **C** (doing $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ then doubling it).
*   **Prediction:** A=30% **B=15%** C=35% D=20%

**basic (Working at Grade 3/4 GCSE)**
*   **Analysis:** These students usually know to square before multiplying by 3 (BIDMAS), but their mental arithmetic with decimals is the main pitfall. Many will believe $0.3^2 = 0.9$.
*   **Primary Distractor:** **D**. If they think $0.3^2 = 0.9$, they will calculate $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$.
*   **Prediction:** A=15% **B=35%** C=10% D=40%

**proficient (Working at Grade 5/6 GCSE)**
*   **Analysis:** These students have a solid grasp of BIDMAS. They are less likely to fall for Distractor C. However, under timed conditions, the "common sense" check of where the decimal point sits in $0.3 \times 0.3$ is still a frequent slip-point.
*   **Primary Distractor:** **D** remains the most attractive error for this group.
*   **Prediction:** A=5% **B=70%** C=5% D=20%

**advanced (Working at Grade 7-9 GCSE)**
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level are fluent in squaring decimals (thinking of it as $3/10 \times 3/10 = 9/100$) and consistently apply indices before multiplication.
*   **Primary Distractor:** Likely no specific distractor; errors would be due to rare "calculator-entry" style slips or overthinking.
*   **Prediction:** A=1% **B=96%** C=1% D=2%

| Ability Level | A (0.81) | B (0.27) | C (1.8) | D (2.7) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **below_basic** | 30% | 15% | 35% | 20% |
| **basic** | 15% | 35% | 10% | 40% |

### Teacher's Note on Distractors:
*   **A ($0.81$):** Common for students who do $(3 \times 0.3)^2$. They mistake the order of operations.
*   **B ($0.27$):** **Correct Answer.**
*   **C ($1.8$):** Common for students who think $x^2$ means "multiply by 2." They do $3 \times 0.3 \times 2$.
*   **D ($2.7$):** The "Decimal Slip." The student knows the order of operations but incorrectly calculates $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$.
