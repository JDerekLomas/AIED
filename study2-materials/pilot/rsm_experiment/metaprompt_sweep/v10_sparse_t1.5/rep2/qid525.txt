Here is a breakdown of how students across the UK (typically Year 7–9) perform on this specific style of fraction arithmetic question.

As a teacher, I’ve weighted these predictions based on common misconceptions: **D** is the classic "add the tops, add the bottoms" error; **A** is the correct value but ignores the "mixed number" instruction; and **C** is a failure to find a common denominator correctly.

**below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=25% D=50%**
*   **The logic:** These students almost universally fall for the "Low Road" strategy. They add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and then simply add the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$), leading directly to **D**. They have little concept of common denominators.

**basic: A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%**
*   **The logic:** Students at this level know they need a common denominator, but often struggle to find the *lowest* one. Many will multiply $10 \times 4$ to get $40$, but then make a multiplication error with the numerators, leading to **C**. Some will successfully convert to improper fractions but forget to convert back to a mixed number, choosing **A**.

**proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%**
*   **The logic:** These students usually handle the common denominator of $20$ well ($4 \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$). The main reason they drop marks is "exam haste"—failing to read the final instruction to provide a mixed number, which leads them to select the improper fraction **A**.

**advanced: A=2% B=97% C=0% D=1%**
*   **The logic:** High-ability students will instinctively find the LCM (20). They are highly unlikely to make the "add across" error. The only reason they would miss the mark is a rare "slip of the pen" or a total misread of the multiple-choice options.

**Summary Table:**
*   **below_basic:** A=10% B=15% C=25% D=50%
*   **basic:** A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%
*   **proficient:** A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
*   **advanced:** A=02% B=97% C=0% D=01%
