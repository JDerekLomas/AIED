As a UK maths teacher, here is a prediction of how students at different levels (Key Stage 3/Key Stage 4) would approach this multiple-choice question on reciprocals and directed numbers.

### Teacher’s Analysis
The question tests two distinct concepts:
1.  **Multiplicative Inverse (Reciprocals):** Knowing that a fraction multiplied by its flip equals 1.
2.  **Directed Numbers:** Knowing that (negative) $\times$ (positive) = (negative).

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic:**
Students at this level often struggle with fraction operations and negative number rules. Many will see the $-\frac{3}{4}$ and $-1$ and assume they need to "match" the fraction (Option D) or use its positive counterpart (Option C). Others may guess the reciprocal (Option A) but lose track of the sign.
*   **A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%**

**basic:**
These students usually recognise that a fraction must "flip" to become a whole number (reciprocal). However, a common misconception at this level is that to make an answer negative, the multiplier must also be negative. They often confuse the rule for adding negatives with the rule for multiplying them.
*   **A=40% B=35% C=10% D=15%**

**proficient:**
Most students here have mastered the reciprocal. They know that $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = 1$. The main "distractor" here is the sign. Many will perform the calculation $(\text{negative}) \times (\text{positive}) = (\text{negative})$ correctly, leading them to A. Some may overthink the "double negative" rule and choose B incorrectly.
*   **A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%**

**advanced:**
Students at this level see this as a basic algebraic step ($-\frac{3}{4}x = -1$). They quickly identify that to maintain a negative product, they must multiply by a positive value. They will identify the reciprocal immediately and verify the signs.
*   **A=95% B=4% C=0% D=1%**
