As a UK maths teacher, I would categorize these ability levels based on GCSE targeting (Grade 1-3 for Basic, 4-6 for Proficient, 7+ for Advanced).

This specific question tests **procedural understanding of the order of operations in reverse** (BIDMAS/BODMAS in reverse for solving equations). 

*   **Tom** is performing the "Addition" step first (+5 to both sides). This is the standard, most efficient method taught in UK classrooms.
*   **Katie** is attempting to "Multiply out the denominator" first. This is a mathematically valid step, but a common trap: she has forgotten to multiply the $-5$ by $3$. Her line should be $x - 15 = 36$.

### Predicted Responses

**below_basic (Targeting Grade 1-2)**
*Focus: Intuition and guessing. Likely to recognize the "17" as looking "right" because 12+5 is 17.*
**A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%**

**basic (Targeting Grade 3)**
*Focus: Procedural "rules." Many students at this level are taught "get rid of the -5 first," so they strongly back Tom. However, a significant number fall for Katie's logic because "multiplying everything by the bottom number" is a half-remembered rule.*
**A=55% B=10% C=30% D=5%**

**proficient (Targeting Grade 4-6)**
*Focus: Emerging algebraic rigor. This is the "danger zone" for this question. Students are becoming confident with clearing denominators and often fail to distribute the multiplication across the constant term. They often believe both methods are equally valid "different ways" of starting.*
**A=60% B=5% C=32% D=3%**

**advanced (Targeting Grade 7-9)**
*Focus: Identifying the distributive property. High-ability students will instantly spot that Katie failed to multiply the -5. They will see Tom is correct and Katie is a common misconception.*
**A=88% B=2% C=8% D=2%**

### Summary Table

| Ability Level | A (Tom) | B (Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **below_basic** | 45% | 15% | 30% | 10% |
| **basic** | 55% | 10% | 30% | 5% |
| **proficient** | 60% | 5% | 32% | 3% |
| **advanced** | 88% | 2% | 8% | 2% |

**Teacher's Note:** Option **C** is the most common "distractor" for middle-to-high ability students who understand that equations can be solved in different orders but haven't yet mastered the rule that a multiplier must apply to *every* term on both sides of the equation.
