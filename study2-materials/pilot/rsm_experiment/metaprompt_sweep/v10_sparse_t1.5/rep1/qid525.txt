Here are the predicted response patterns based on typical UK secondary school student errors (Key Stage 3 and GCSE).

**Key to Distractors:**
*   **A ($ \frac{99}{20} $):** The mathematically correct value, but in improper fraction form. Students who ignore the instruction "leave your answer as a mixed number" will choose this.
*   **B ($ 4 \frac{19}{20} $):** The correct answer.
*   **C ($ \frac{99}{40} $):** Common error: adds the numerators correctly after finding a common denominator, but mistakenly adds the denominators ($20 + 20 = 40$).
*   **D ($ 4 \frac{8}{14} $):** The most common lower-ability error: adds the whole numbers ($2+2$), then simply adds the numerators ($7+1$) and adds the denominators ($10+4$).

### Predicted Responses

**below_basic:** A=5% B=15% C=30% D=50%
*   **Rationale:** Students at this level almost always apply "add the tops, add the bottoms." They will see $7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$ and immediately gravitate toward D.

**basic:** A=15% B=40% C=20% D=25%
*   **Rationale:** These students know they need a common denominator but often forget the process halfway through. Many will still fall for D, while others will successfully convert to $\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4}$ but then add the denominators to get 40 (Choice C).

**proficient:** A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
*   **Rationale:** Most will get the correct value. The primary error here is not reading the final line of the prompt. Having calculated $\frac{99}{20}$ (a common method is to convert to improper fractions first), they will select A because it matches their working out, overlooking the "mixed number" requirement.

**advanced:** A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
*   **Rationale:** High-ability students will recognize the need for a common denominator (20) and will usually follow the instruction to provide a mixed number. The small percentage for A accounts for "silly mistakes" under timed pressure.
