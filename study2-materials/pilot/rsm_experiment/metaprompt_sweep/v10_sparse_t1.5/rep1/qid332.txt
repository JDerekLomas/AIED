In the context of the UK National Curriculum, this question tests the understanding of **inverse operations** and the **order of operations** when rearranging linear equations.

The common misconception tested here is whether students understand that when multiplying by the denominator (3), they must multiply *every term* in the equation, not just the fraction and the result.

### Predicted Student Responses

| **Basic** | 45% | 20% | 25% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 75% | 5% | 15% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 95% | 1% | 3% | 1% |

### Teacher Commentary and Rationale

#### **Below Basic (Low G3 / Grade 2)**
Students at this level often guess based on what "looks" like a maths rule they recognise. Many will choose **B** because they see the number 3 and the number 12 and perform $12 \times 3 = 36$, assuming that "getting rid of the fraction" is always the first and only priority, regardless of the other terms.

#### **Basic (G4 / Grade 3)**
These students are beginning to understand the "flow" of an equation. They are more likely to recognise that adding 5 to both sides is a "safe" first step. However, a significant number will choose **C** because Katie’s working ($x - 5 = 36$) looks plausible to them—they often fail to realise that if Katie multiplies by 3, she must also multiply the -5.

#### **Proficient (G5-6 / Grade 4-5)**
Most students at this level have been taught "Change the side, change the sign." They will correctly identify that Tom has added 5 to both sides correctly ($12 + 5 = 17$). They are trained enough to spot that Katie has "forgotten" to multiply the -5 by 3, which allows them to confidently reject Katie and choose **A**.

#### **Advanced (G7+ / Grade 6-9)**
These students see the structure of the equation instantly. They recognise that Tom’s method is the standard, efficient first step. They can verify Katie is wrong by "distributing" the multiplication across the entire left-hand side, noting that Katie’s line should have been $x - 15 = 36$. They almost exclusively choose **A**.

**Correct Answer: A (Only Tom)**
