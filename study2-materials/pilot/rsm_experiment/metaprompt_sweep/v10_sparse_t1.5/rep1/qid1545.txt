In the UK secondary mathematics curriculum, this question assesses understanding of **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)**.

The correct mathematical steps are:
*   Left Side: $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = \mathbf{11}$
*   Right Side: $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$
*   Conclusion: $11 > 5$, therefore **A** is correct.

Here is the predicted distribution of student responses by ability level:

### **below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=50% D=5%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level often treat math as a "left-to-right" process. They will likely calculate the left side as $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$ and the right side also as $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$. Because they get $5 = 5$, the majority will select **C**. Some may guess **B** if they feel the brackets "add value" to the right side.

### **basic: A=35% B=20% C=40% D=5%**
*   **Reasoning:** These students have heard of BIDMAS but apply it inconsistently. Many will still default to the left-to-right calculation for the first expression ($8+12 \div 4 = 5$) and therefore pick **C**. However, a significant portion will correctly identify that the division on the left should happen first, leading them to $11 > 5$.

### **proficient: A=75% B=10% C=12% D=3%**
*   **Reasoning:** Proficient students generally apply BIDMAS correctly. Most will calculate $11$ and $5$ accurately. Errors here are usually "slip" errors (arithmetic mistakes like $20 \div 4 = 4$) rather than conceptual ones. A small number might still be tricked by the visual similarity of the numbers and instinctively choose **C**.

### **advanced: A=96% B=2% C=1% D=1%**
*   **Reasoning:** Advanced students will instantly recognize this as a test of BIDMAS. They will likely solve it mentally in seconds. The very low margin for error accounts for rare instances of over-thinking or misreading the division sign as a plus sign.
