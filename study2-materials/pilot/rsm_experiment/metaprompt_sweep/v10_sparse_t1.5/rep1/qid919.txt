In the context of the UK National Curriculum, this question tests a combination of **substitution**, **order of operations (BIDMAS)**, and **decimal place value**.

The correct calculation is: $0.3^2 = 0.09$, then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

Here is a prediction of how students across different ability levels (Year 9/GCSE) would likely respond:

### **below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=35% D=20%**
*   **Analysis:** These students struggle with BIDMAS and decimal multiplication.
*   **C (1.8)** is often the most common wrong answer here: students perform $(3 \times 0.3)^2$, leading to $0.9^2$. They then make a decimal error $(0.9 \times 2$ or $0.9 \times 0.9 = 1.8)$.
*   **A (0.81)** comes from doing $(3 \times 0.3)^2$ correctly as $0.9^2 = 0.81$. They ignore the order of operations entirely.
*   **D (2.7)** is a guess based on moving the decimal point of $3 \times 3 \times 3$ randomly.

### **basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%**
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level know they should square first but fail the decimal calculation, or they know the numbers involve "27" but cannot place the decimal.
*   **B (0.27)** starts to appear as they correctly identify $0.3^2 = 0.09$, but many still fall for the **A (0.81)** trap (multiplying $3 \times 0.3$ first).
*   **D (2.7)** is a very common "distractor" for this level: they do $3 \times 3^2 = 27$ and then try to "fix" the decimal point by moving it one place because $0.3$ has one decimal place.

### **proficient: A=10% B=75% C=5% D=10%**
*   **Analysis:** These students (aiming for Grade 5/6) generally understand BIDMAS ($Indices$ before $Multiplication$).
*   **B (0.27)** is the dominant answer.
*   The errors remaining are usually "slips." **D (2.7)** remains the main distractor because they might calculate $3 \times 0.09$ and mentally slip the decimal point one place to the right, or simply perform $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then accidentally multiply by 3 again instead of squaring.

### **advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%**
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level (Grade 7+) have mastered decimal arithmetic and the priority of operations.
*   **B (0.27)** should be nearly universal.
*   Any incorrect answers are likely due to extreme haste or misreading the $x^2$ as $2x$.
