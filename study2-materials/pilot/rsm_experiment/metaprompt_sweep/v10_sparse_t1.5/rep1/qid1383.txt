As a UK maths teacher, I would expect the common misconceptions to centre around two areas: confusing multiplication with indices (linear vs power) and the rules of negative signs when squaring/raising to an even power.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses based on typical classroom performance data:

**below_basic:** 
**A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%**
*At this level, students rarely grasp index notation. They will almost certainly treat \(k^4\) as \(k \times 4\). The split between B and D depends on whether they ignore the negative sign or attempt to include it.*

**basic:** 
**A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%**
*Students here usually know that \(3^4 = 81\). However, the most common error at this level is the "negative stays" misconception. They calculate \(3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81\) and then simply re-attach the negative sign from the question, leading them to C.*

**proficient:** 
**A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%**
*These students are fluent with powers and usually understand that an even exponent results in a positive product. The 20% choosing C represents those who might be over-reliant on non-scientific calculators (or entering it into a calculator as \(-3^4\) without brackets), which yields -81.*

**advanced:** 
**A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%**
*Top-tier students will instantly recognise that \( (-3)^4 = (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81 \). Any errors here are typically down to extreme "exam haze" or calculation slips, though these are rare for this level of difficulty.*

***

**Teacher's Summary of Distractors:**
*   **A (81):** The correct answer.
*   **B (12):** The "Multiplication Error" ($3 \times 4$).
*   **C (-81):** The "Negative Parity Error" (forgetting that an even number of negatives make a positive).
*   **D (-12):** Combined error (multiplied by 4 and kept the negative sign).
