In the UK secondary mathematics context, this question tests two distinct skills: **Order of Operations (BIDMAS)** and **Directed Numbers (Arithmetic with Negatives).**

The correct calculation is: $3 - 5 + (4 \times 2) \rightarrow 3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = \mathbf{6}$ (Option A).

Here is the predicted distribution based on common misconceptions at each KS3/KS4 ability level:

### **below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%**
*   **The Logic:** Students at this level often work strictly left-to-right, ignoring BIDMAS entirely.
*   **The Error:** Many will do $(3-5+4) \times 2 = 2 \times 2 = 4$ (**B**). Others will struggle with $3-5$ being a negative number, leading them to guess between **C** and **D**. They see "$-12$" and "$-10$" as "maths-looking" answers for those who know "negatives are involved."

### **basic: A=35% B=45% C=10% D=10%**
*   **The Logic:** These students know the acronym BIDMAS exists, but they often apply it too rigidly or fail the negative number calculation.
*   **The Error:** The most common mistake here is still the left-to-right "reading" of the question: $3-5 = -2$, then $-2+4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = \mathbf{4}$ (**B**). Because they "did some taking away" and got a positive answer, they feel confident. They are less likely to choose C or D than Below Basic students.

### **proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%**
*   **The Logic:** These students prioritises the multiplication ($4 \times 2 = 8$).
*   **The Error:** The main pitfall for a proficient student is the remaining calculation: $3 - 5 + 8$. A common "BIDMAS trap" is thinking **A**ddition must come before **S**ubtraction. They might erroneously calculate $5 + 8 = 13$ and then do $3 - 13 = \mathbf{-10}$ (**D**), or $3 - (5+8)$ leading to **C**. However, most "proficient" UK students know Addition and Subtraction have equal priority.

### **advanced: A=96% B=2% C=1% D=1%**
*   **The Logic:** Advanced students recognise that Multiplication is performed first and that Addition/Subtraction are solved left-to-right (or treated as terms in an expression).
*   **The Error:** The 4% margin covers "slips" (computational errors) rather than conceptual misunderstandings. A student might accidentally calculate $3 - 5 = -3$ or similar under exam pressure.

***

**Key for the distracted answers:**
*   **A (6):** Correct ($3 - 5 + 8$).
*   **B (4):** Left-to-right error ($3-5+4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$).
*   **C (-12):** Left-to-right error with a sign mistake, or $(3-5-4) \times 2$.
*   **D (-10):** BIDMAS "Addition before Subtraction" trap ($3 - [5+8]$).
