Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical UK classroom performance data for Key Stage 3 and GCSE Foundation/Higher students.

**Predicted Response Distributions:**

**below_basic:** A=15% B=10% C=45% D=30%
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level often struggle with the "rules" of fractions. They are highly likely to add across the numerators AND denominators ($1+2=3$ and $5+5=10$), leading them to **D**. A significant portion will also treat the whole numbers and numerators as one sequence, occasionally resulting in **C**.

**basic:** A=40% B=15% C=15% D=30%
*   **Analysis:** These students have a loose grasp of adding whole numbers ($2+1=3$). However, the "common denominator" rule is still shaky. Many will still fall for the trap of adding the denominators ($5+5=10$), making **D** a very popular distractor. Some may convert to improper fractions correctly but fail to convert back, leading them to **B**.

**proficient:** A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
*   **Analysis:** These students understand that the denominator remains the same. The main "risk" here isn't the calculation, but the instruction. Even though **B** is numerically equal, proficient students occasionally provide the improper fraction out of habit, despite the question asking for a mixed number.

**advanced:** A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
*   **Analysis:** Mastery is high. Errors here are almost exclusively "slips" (copying a number wrong) or ignoring the "mixed number" instruction. They recognize that $3 \frac{3}{5}$ is the simplest and requested form immediately.

**Teacher's Notes on Distractors:**
*   **A (Correct):** The intended path (add wholes, add parts).
*   **B (Incorrect form):** Correct value, but ignores the "mixed number" instruction.
*   **C (Computational error):** Ignores whole numbers or attempts to add everything across.
*   **D (Conceptual error):** The most common mistake in the UK curriculum—adding the denominators together.
