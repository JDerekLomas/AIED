Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical misconceptions encountered in the UK secondary maths curriculum (KS3/KS4).

In this specific problem, the primary distractors are **inverse operation confusion** (multiplying instead of dividing) and **misapplication of fraction arithmetic** (dividing the denominator by the coefficient rather than multiplying it).

### **Predicted Responses**

**below_basic:** A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
*   **Analysis:** Many students at this level struggle with the "one-third of a fraction" concept. **A** is the most common "guess" because they see 3 and 12 and immediately think of the relationship $12 \div 3 = 4$. **C** is also popular as they simply multiply 3 and 12 but ignore the fractional structure entirely.

**basic:** A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%
*   **Analysis:** Students are starting to understand they need to divide by 3, but they often perform the operation incorrectly. **B** is the correct answer, but **A** remains a strong "low-confidence" distractor because they see the numbers 3 and 12 and assume the answer must involve a 4.

**proficient:** A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level generally recognise that $p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3$ is equivalent to $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$. Most will correctly identify **B**. Errors are usually due to rushing and picking **A** because it "looks right" visually ($12 \div 3$).

**advanced:** A=2% B=97% C=0% D=1%
*   **Analysis:** Advanced students (likely Target Grade 7-9) will treat this as a one-step operation. They will instinctively multiply the denominator by the coefficient. Errors would be extremely rare and likely due to clerical slips.

### **Teacher’s Notes on Distractors:**
*   **Distractor A ($1/4$):** The most common error. Students divide 12 by 3 instead of dividing $1/12$ by 3.
*   **Distractor B (Correct):** $p = \frac{1}{12 \times 3} = \frac{1}{36}$.
*   **Distractor C ($4$):** Students ignore the fraction entirely and treat the equation as $p/3 = 12$ or simply perform $12 \div 3$ and move the result to the numerator.
*   **Distractor D ($1/9$):** A "distractor by proximity"—students occasionally misread the 12 or subtract 3 from 12 in a moment of cognitive overload.
