Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical misconceptions encountered in the UK GCSE Mathematics curriculum (Foundation and Higher tiers).

### Analysis of Distractors
*   **A (The Correct Answer):** $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.
*   **B (Add across):** Adding the numerators ($3+4$) and adding the denominators ($2x+x$). This is the most common error with all fractions.
*   **C (Incorrect LCM):** Multiplying the first fraction's numerator by 1 and the second by 2, but then forgetting the denominator stays $2x$, or simply thinking $3 + (2 \times 4) = 11$ and putting it over $x$ because $x$ looks "simpler."
*   **D (Numerators only):** Correctly identifying the common denominator as $2x$, but forgetting to scale the second numerator (simply doing $3+4$ over $2x$).

### Predicted Responses

**below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%**
*Students at this level struggle with the concept of a common denominator. Their primary instinct is to add across (Option B). If they recognise the need for a common denominator, they often forget to adjust the numerator (Option D).*

**basic: A=35% B=25% C=10% D=30%**
*Typically Grade 3/4 students. They are starting to understand that denominators must be the same. However, the "equivalent fractions" step (multiplying the 4 by 2) is frequently missed, leading them to Option D. Option B remains a strong distractor for those rushing.*

**proficient: A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%**
*Typically Grade 5/6 students. Most will correctly identify that $\frac{4}{x}$ is $\frac{8}{2x}$. The main source of error here is the "silly mistake" of failing to multiply the 4, or a cognitive load error resulting in Option D.*

**advanced: A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%**
*Typically Grade 7+ students. This is a foundational algebraic fraction question for them. Errors would be extremely rare and likely down to misreading the question or a momentary lapse in concentration.*
