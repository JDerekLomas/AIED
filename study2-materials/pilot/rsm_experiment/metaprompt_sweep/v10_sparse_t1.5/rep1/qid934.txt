In a UK secondary school context (Key Stage 3 or GCSE), this question tests the ability to substitute values into a linear equation in the form $ax + by = c$.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses based on student ability levels:

**below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=35% D=10%**
*   **A (20):** These students often lack "algebraic fluency" and simply multiply all visible numbers ($4 \times 1 \times 5$ or $4 \times 2 + 10 = 18 \approx 20$).
*   **C (5):** This is a very common "guess." Students see the $10$ at the end and divide it by the $2$ next to the $y$, completely ignoring the $4x$ term.
*   **B (3):** Rare; usually a random guess.

**basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%**
*   **C (5):** The dominant error here. Students substitute $x=0$ correctly to get $4(0) + 2y = 10$, but then mistakenly think $0 + 2y = 10$ means they just need to consider the $10$. However, many will see $2y = 10$ and correctly reach 5. The high percentage here is because "5" feels like a "clean" answer that relates to 10 and 2.
*   **B (3):** Some may try to solve $4+2=6$ and $10-6=4$, getting lost in the operations.

**proficient: A=5% B=75% C=15% D=5%**
*   **B (3):** Most proficient students will correctly substitute $x=0$, leaving $2y = 10 \rightarrow y=5$. **Wait—the math is actually $y=5$.**
*   *Correction on the math logic:* If $x=0$, $4(0) + 2y = 10 \implies 2y = 10 \implies y = 5$.
*   *Re-evaluating based on the correct answer (C):* 
    *   **B (3)** is actually the answer if $x=1$. Some students will solve for the second column instead of the first ($x=0$).
    *   **D (2.5)** is a "half of five" error.

**Corrected Predictions (Goal is C=5):**

**below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=30% D=15%**
*   Many will choose **A** by doing $4 \times 5 = 20$ (looking at the coefficients).

**basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%**
*   Most will successfully identify that $4 \times 0 = 0$. They are then left with $2y = 10$ and can mentally solve for 5.

**proficient: A=2% B=8% C=85% D=5%**
*   The majority will use the formal method: $4(0) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 10 \rightarrow y = 5$.

**advanced: A=0% B=2% C=98% D=0%**
*   Advanced students will solve this almost instantly by inspection. The only errors would be misreading the table and providing the value for $x=1$ (which would be $y=3$, answer B).

**Final Table:**
below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=8% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=98% D=0%
