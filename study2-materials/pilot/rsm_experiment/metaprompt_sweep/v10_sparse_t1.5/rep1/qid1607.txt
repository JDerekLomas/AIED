In the UK secondary mathematics curriculum (KS3/KS4), this question tests the ability to inverse operations correctly and identify common algebraic misconceptions.

Step 1 is **correct** ($15 \times 4 = 60$).
Step 2 is **incorrect**. Isaac added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting 1. The correct answer is $k=59$.
Therefore, the correct option is **A**.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%**
*   **Analysis:** Students at this level often lack "fluency check" skills. Many will see that $60+1=61$ is a correct sum in isolation and assume the whole process is correct (Option C). Others may guess randomly or incorrectly assume the multiplication in Step 1 was the error.

**basic: A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%**
*   **Analysis:** These students are more likely to recognise that Step 1 is correct. However, a significant portion will still fall into the "operator trap" in Step 2. They see a $+1$ and instinctively think the next number should be one higher ($60 \to 61$), failing to realise they must perform the inverse operation to solve for $k$.

**proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%**
*   **Analysis:** Proficient students (aiming for GCSE Grade 4/5) generally understand inverse operations. Most will correctly identify that Step 2 requires subtraction. The 15% opting for C are likely those who worked too quickly and didn't verify the final step, a common "careless" error at this level.

**advanced: A=94% B=1% C=3% D=2%**
*   **Analysis:** Advanced students (GCSE Grade 7+) will solve the equation mentally before even looking at the steps. They will immediately spot the sign error in Step 2. The very small percentage of errors would be attributed to misreading the question (e.g., thinking the question asked which step was *wrong*).
