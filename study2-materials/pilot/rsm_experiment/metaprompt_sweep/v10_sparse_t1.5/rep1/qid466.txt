In the UK secondary curriculum (Key Stage 3/4), this question tests three distinct concepts: reciprocal properties, multiplying fractions, and the rules of directed numbers (negative signs).

Here is the predicted distribution of responses based on typical student misconceptions and mastery levels:

**below_basic:** 
*Students at this level often struggle with the concept of a reciprocal and the rules for multiplying two negatives. They are likely to choose C or D because they see the numbers already present in the question and assume the answer must be the same or the simple positive version.*
**A=15% B=10% C=40% D=35%**

**basic:** 
*Students here often recognize that a "flip" (reciprocal) is required to get back to 1. However, they frequently forget the sign rule, incorrectly believing that because the target is -1, the multiplier must also be negative (ignoring that a negative times a negative equals a positive).*
**A=25% B=45% C=20% D=10%**

**proficient:** 
*These students (typically Grade 4/5) understand that $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = 1$. Most will correctly navigate the negative signs, realizing that since the result is negative and one factor is already negative, the missing factor must be positive. However, a significant minority will still make a "sign error" under pressure.*
**A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%**

**advanced:** 
*Students at this level (Grade 7+) instinctively recognize this as a reciprocal property question ($x \cdot \frac{1}{x} = 1$). They will perform a quick mental check on the signs and reach the correct answer almost immediately.*
**A=94% B=4% C=1% D=1%**

### Summary Table

| Level | A (Correct) | B (Sign Error) | C (Value Error) | D (Identity Error) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **below_basic** | 15% | 10% | 40% | 35% |
| **basic** | 25% | 45% | 20% | 10% |
| **proficient** | 70% | 20% | 5% | 5% |
| **advanced** | 94% | 4% | 1% | 1% |

**Teacher's Note on Common Misconceptions:**
*   **The "Same Sign" Trap:** Weakest students think $- \times - = -$. This leads them to Choice B.
*   **The "Additive Inverse" Confusion:** Students may confuse the reciprocal (for multiplication) with the additive inverse (for addition), leading them to look for something that "cancels" the fraction visually rather than mathematically.
