As a UK maths teacher, I would analyse this question based on the common pitfalls associated with **GCSE Foundation and Higher** tiers (Grades 1-9).

The core difficulty here lies in the multi-step nature of the rearrangement: multiplying by a decimal, moving a negative term (or subtracting from a constant), and dividing by 10.

### The Correct Calculation:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$ (**Option C**)

### Predicted Responses:

*   **Below Basic (Grade 1-2):** These students often struggle with the order of operations and negative signs. A common error is calculating $30 - 3 = 27$ then dividing by 10 (Option D), or confusing which variable to substitute into, sometimes trying to solve $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$.
*   **Basic (Grade 3-4):** These students can substitute but often make an algebraic error. The most common is "balancing" the $-3$ by subtracting it from $30$ instead of adding ($10x = 27$), leading to D.
*   **Proficient (Grade 5-6):** These students generally navigate the algebra well but may occasionally slip on the sign change or decimal placement.
*   **Advanced (Grade 7-9):** These students will perform the rearrangement fluently, often mentally or with minimal working.

**below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=30% D=40%**
*(Logic: High guesswork. D is attractive because they see 30 and 3 and subtract them instinctively. C is often hit by accident or simple substitution.)*

**basic: A=10% B=5% C=45% D=40%**
*(Logic: Major distractor is D. Students substitute correctly to get $10x - 3 = 30$ but then perform $30 - 3$ to "move" the 3 over.)*

**proficient: A=5% B=2% C=85% D=8%**
*(Logic: Most have mastered one-step rearrangement and the use of the inverse. Small errors in arithmetic account for the rest.)*

**advanced: A=1% B=0% C=98% D=1%**
*(Logic: This is a "buffer" question for advanced students; errors are purely down to misreading the numbers.)*

### Key to Distractors:
*   **A (4.25):** Result of incorrectly solving $6y = 10x - 30$ with $x=0.5$ (misidentifying which row is which).
*   **D (2.7):** The "Sign Error" king. $10x = 30 - 3$ instead of $30 + 3$. Very common in the UK Foundation tier.
