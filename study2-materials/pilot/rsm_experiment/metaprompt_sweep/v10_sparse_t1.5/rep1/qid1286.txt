In the UK secondary curriculum (GCSE Higher Tier), this question tests the ability to recall the volume of a sphere formula and rearrange equations involving cube roots and fractions.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level:

**below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level often struggle to recall the formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$). Many will guess based on "familiar looking" arrangements. **A** is a common trap because they often remember the 4, 3, and $\pi$ but multiply them together rather than performing inverse operations. **D** is chosen by those who think the 3 and 4 move outside the root.

**basic: A=25% B=20% C=35% D=20%**
*   **Reasoning:** These students likely remember the formula or look it up but struggle with the multi-step rearrangement. Many will make a mistake in the order of operations (e.g., dividing by 3 instead of multiplying by 3). **C** starts to emerge as the lead, but confusion between multiplication/division for the constants remains high.

**proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students working at a Grade 6/7 level generally know the formula and understand that to isolate $r^3$, they must multiply by 3 and divide by $4\pi$. The most common error here is **B**, where the student incorrectly moves the 3 to the denominator instead of the numerator.

**advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%**
*   **Reasoning:** Grade 8/9 students (A/A*) treat this as a routine manipulation task. They are comfortable with the reciprocal of $\frac{4}{3}$ being $\frac{3}{4}$ and will systematically move terms to isolate $r$. The few errors usually stem from misreading the options or "calculator-brain" typos in their mental working.
