As a UK maths teacher, I would expect to see the following distribution. The "algebraic fraction" notation is a key threshold in Key Stage 3 (Years 7–9). Students at the lower end often struggle with the "vinculum" (fraction bar) acting as a grouping symbol.

**Predicted Student Responses:**

**below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=40% D=15%**
*   **Reasoning:** Many students at this level do not yet associate the fraction bar with division. **C** is a common "left-to-right" error where they see $c$, see a division bar, see $h$, and then just tack the $+4$ on the end. Some pick **B** simply because they feel there should be more "symmetry" or numbers in the numerator.

**basic: A=55% B=10% C=15% D=20%**
*   **Reasoning:** These students recognise that division means a fraction, but they frequently invert the relationship (the "big number goes on top" mentality or general confusion over divisor/dividend), leading to a high percentage of **D**. **C** remains a distraction for those who don't understand that the brackets force the $+4$ into the denominator.

**proficient: A=85% B=2% C=5% D=8%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level (working at a solid GCSE Grade 4/5) have mastered the convention that the denominator acts as a bracketed expression. Errors here are usually due to "examination rush" (skimming the question and clicking **D** by mistake) rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.

**advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%**
*   **Reasoning:** This is a fundamental "fluency" skill for higher-tier students. Anything other than **A** would be considered a rare "silly mistake" or a misclick on a digital platform.
