This question is a classic diagnostic tool in UK secondary schools (Year 7-10). It tests the understanding of the "denominator as the unknown" and distinguishes between those who understand algebraic structure and those who simply perform operations on the numbers they see.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level:

**below_basic:** 
A=30% **B=35%** C=25% D=10%
*   **Analysis:** At this level, students often use "number grabbing." They see 10 and 5 and assume the operation must be multiplication ($10 \times 5 = 50$). C is chosen by those who think it must be $10 \div 5$. D is a "safe" guess for those confused by the fraction.

**basic:** 
A=35% **B=30%** C=30% D=5%
*   **Analysis:** These students are beginning to rearrange but often get the division backwards. They might recognize it involves division but calculate $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$, leading them to C. Many still default to B (multiplication) because it feels more "natural" than getting a decimal answer.

**proficient:** 
**A=65%** B=10% C=20% D=5%
*   **Analysis:** Most students here have learned the "swap" trick (switching the $p$ and the 10) or correctly multiply by $p$ and then divide by 10. The common error here is still C, driven by the instinctive desire for the larger number to be divided by the smaller number ($10 \div 5$).

**advanced:** 
**A=95%** B=0% C=5% D=0%
*   **Analysis:** Advanced students (likely aiming for Grade 7-9 at GCSE) will see that $p$ must be a fraction/decimal because $10$ is larger than $5$. They will instantly identify $p = 5/10$ and simplify to $0.5$. The rare error C would only occur through extreme haste.

### Teacher's Guide to the Distractors:
*   **A (Correct):** Shows understanding of $p = 5/10$.
*   **B (Multiplication error):** Student thinks they need to "get rid" of the 5 by multiplying.
*   **C (Reverse division):** Student correctly identifies division is needed but assumes it must be $Large \div Small$ ($10 \div 5$).
*   **D (Conceptual hurdle):** Student believes an equation cannot be solved if the numerator is smaller than the result.
