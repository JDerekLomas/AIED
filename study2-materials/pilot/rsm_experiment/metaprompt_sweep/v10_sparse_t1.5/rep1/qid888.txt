Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical UK secondary school assessment data (Key Stage 3/GCSE level).

### **Pedagogical Analysis**
The common pitfalls in this specific question revolve around directed numbers (integers). Students must correctly navigate two negative signs:
1.  **The Sum:** $-5 + -7 = -12$
2.  **The Product:** $-5 \times -7 = +35$

### **Predicted Responses**

**below_basic:** (Target Grade 1–2)
*These students often "do something" with the numbers but struggle with FOIL/Grid methods and signs.*
**A=40% B=15% C=20% D=25%**
*   **Rationale:** Choice A is very common here; students often subtract the smaller number from the larger ($7-5=2$) and then follow the sign of the larger number. D is chosen because they remember "negative times positive is negative."

**basic:** (Target Grade 3–4)
*These students know to add and multiply, but usually fail the "minus times a minus" rule.*
**A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%**
*   **Rationale:** The "Basic" student knows $5+7=12$, narrowing it to B, C, or D. However, the misconception that "two minuses make a minus" or simply seeing minus signs in the question leads them frequently to Choice D.

**proficient:** (Target Grade 5–6)
*These students are fluent in the method but make occasional "slips" under exam pressure.*
**A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%**
*   **Rationale:** Most get it right (B). The most common remaining error is Choice D, where a student performs the addition correctly ($-12$) but fails the multiplication sign $(-5 \times -7)$.

**advanced:** (Target Grade 7–9)
*These students have mastered integer rules and algebraic expansion.*
**A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%**
*   **Rationale:** Errors at this level are rare and usually down to misreading the question (e.g., thinking it was $m+7$) rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.

### **Summary of Distractors**
*   **A ($m^2 - 2m - 35$):** The "Difference" distractor. For students who confuse adding with finding the difference.
*   **C ($m^2 + 12m + 35$):** The "Ignoring Signs" distractor. For students who treat everything as positive.
*   **D ($m^2 - 12m - 35$):** The "Sign Slip" distractor. The most common error for mid-tier students (multiplying $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-35$).
