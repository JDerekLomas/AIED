In the UK secondary curriculum, this question targets a specific sub-skill of expanding binomials: the ability to identify and correctly multiply the constant terms, specifically handling the "double negative."

Here is the prediction of student responses by ability level (roughly mapped to GCSE target grades 1-9):

**below_basic (Target 1-2):**
*   **A=15% B=40% C=25% D=20%**
*   **Analysis:** Many students at this level struggle with directed numbers. **B (-4)** is the most common "guess" because they see the digit 4 and a minus sign, or they simply combine the digits without a clear rule. **C/D** are popular because students frequently confuse *multiplication* with *addition* when expanding, calculating $-1 - 4 = -5$ or ignoring signs to get $+5$.

**basic (Target 3-4):**
*   **A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%**
*   **Analysis:** These students understand that they need to multiply ($1 \times 4$). However, the "negative $\times$ negative = positive" rule is still shaky. Many will choose **B** because they see "minus signs in the brackets" and assume the answer must remain negative. Others still default to addition/subtraction (**C/D**) when they panic.

**proficient (Target 5-6):**
*   **A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%**
*   **Analysis:** At this level, students are fluent with the FOIL/Grid method. They know that these specific arrows represent the "Last" terms and that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive. Errors here are usually due to "slips" or rushing, leading to **B**.

**advanced (Target 7-9):**
*   **A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%**
*   **Analysis:** For high-achieving students, this is a trivial component of a larger problem. The only errors would be unforced cognitive slips. They would find the addition-based distractors (**C/D**) illogical.

**Key Teacher Insights:**
*   **Distractor B (-4)** is the "Negative Sign Trap."
*   **Distractor D (-5)** is the "Operation Confusion" (adding instead of multiplying).
*   The primary pedagogical hurdle here isn't the algebra; it's the **integer arithmetic** embedded within the algebra.
