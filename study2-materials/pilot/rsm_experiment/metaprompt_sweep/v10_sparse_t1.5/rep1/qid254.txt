As a UK maths teacher, this question is a classic "trap" designed to test understanding of the number zero as a data point and the priority of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

Here is the prediction of student responses by ability level:

**below_basic:** 
*These students often view '0' as 'nothing' and therefore irrelevant to the calculation. They also lack awareness of formal notation requirements.*
**A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%**

**basic:**
*Students at this level know they need to divide by how many numbers there are, but frequently ignore the 0 when counting the set, leading them to C. Many will also choose B because it looks like "sum then divide" without realizing the lack of brackets makes it mathematically incorrect.*
**A=25% B=30% C=40% D=5%**

**proficient:**
*These students recognize that 0 must be included in the count (denominator of 5). However, many will see the numerator of A ($1+3+4+7$) and think "adding 0 doesn't change the total, so this is correct," forgetting that the fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol. Some will fall for B if they are reliant on calculator syntax.*
**A=55% B=15% C=10% D=20%**

**advanced:**
*Advanced students will spot the nuances immediately. They will see that A is actually mathematically correct (as $0+1+3+4+7 = 1+3+4+7$), but they will pause at B (missing brackets) and C (wrong denominator). They are the most likely to correctly identify that A is technically a valid calculation for the mean, even if "atypical."*
**A=85% B=2% C=3% D=10%**

### Teacher's Note on the "Correct" Answer:
In a strict mathematical sense, **A is the correct answer**. 
*   **A** equals $15/5 = 3$, which is the mean. Adding 0 doesn't change the sum.
*   **B** is incorrect due to BIDMAS: $0+1+3+4+(7 \div 5) = 9.4$.
*   **C** is incorrect because the set contains 5 data points, not 4.
*   **D** is the "distractor" for students who think A is wrong because the '0' isn't explicitly written in the numerator.
