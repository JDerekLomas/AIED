In the UK secondary maths curriculum, this question tests two specific areas of "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS):
1.  **Hierarchy:** Multiplication comes before Addition.
2.  **Associativity/Direction:** Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right.

**The correct answer is B.**

Here is a prediction of how UK students (Years 7–9) would respond by ability level:

### **below_basic**
*Students at this level generally read mathematics like a sentence, from left to right, regardless of operators. They often ignore the BIDMAS hierarchy entirely.*
*   **A=70%** (Pure left-to-right strategy for both problems).
*   **B=10%** (Guessed correctly or remembered a rule for Q).
*   **C=15%** (Misinterpreting "Addition comes before Subtraction" in BIDMAS literally).
*   **D=5%** (Inconsistent application).

### **basic**
*Students have been introduced to BIDMAS. They correctly apply it to Problem Q (Multiplication first), but they fall into a common trap with Problem P, thinking Addition **must** happen before Subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym.*
*   **A=15%** (Relies on left-to-right but knows some rules).
*   **B=30%** (Starting to master left-to-right associativity).
*   **C=5%** (Rare).
*   **D=50%** (The "BIDMAS Trap": They incorrectly believe $5+6$ must happen first because Addition is listed first in the acronym).

### **proficient**
*These students are secure in the hierarchy (Multiplication first) and are beginning to understand that Addition and Subtraction are inverse operations with equal priority.*
*   **A=5%** (Careless reading).
*   **B=75%** (Secure in BIDMAS and left-to-right convention).
*   **C=0%**
*   **D=20%** (High-achieving students who still rigidly follow the acronym letters without understanding equal priority).

### **advanced**
*These students understand that Addition/Subtraction are "Level 1" operations and are worked left-to-right. They also recognise that $4-5+6$ is effectively $4 + (-5) + 6$.*
*   **A=2%** (Misclick/Mistake).
*   **B=95%** (Complete mastery of order of operations).
*   **C=0%**
*   **D=3%** (Occasional over-thinking of the acronym).

**Teacher's Note on "The D Trap":** 
In UK classrooms, **Option D** is the most common "sophisticated" error. Students who are taught BIDMAS as a rigid hierarchy often calculate $4 - (5+6) = -7$ instead of $(4-5) + 6 = 5$. Distinguishing between the Proficient and Advanced levels usually comes down to whether they understand that **AS** (Addition/Subtraction) and **DM** (Division/Multiplication) are tied pairs.
