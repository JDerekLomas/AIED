In the UK context, this question primarily tests **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). It specifically targets the common misconception that operations should be performed strictly from left to right.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses based on typical UK Key Stage 3 and 4 performance data:

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic:** (Targeting Grade 1-2 / Bottom Set)
*Students here almost always calculate from left to right, ignoring order of operations entirely.*
* **A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%**
* **Logic:** They calculate the left side as $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$. They calculate the right side as $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$. Seeing "the same numbers," they choose **C (=)**.

**basic:** (Targeting Grade 3-4 / Lower-Middle Set)
*Students have heard of BIDMAS but apply it inconsistently or make arithmetic errors.*
* **A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%**
* **Logic:** A large portion still defaults to "left-to-right" logic (Resulting in C). Some may correctly calculate the left side as $8+3=11$, and the right side as $20 \div 4 = 5$. Because $11 > 5$, they choose **A**. However, "Left-to-right" remains the dominant distractor.

**proficient:** (Targeting Grade 5-6 / Upper-Middle Set)
*Students generally know to divide before adding, but some may rush and miss the brackets on the right.*
* **A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%**
* **Logic:** Most will successfully perform $12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8+3=11$ for the left. They correctly identify $20 \div 4 = 5$ for the right. Since $11 > 5$, the correct answer **A** is selected.

**advanced:** (Targeting Grade 7-9 / Top Set)
*Students are fluent in order of operations and mental arithmetic.*
* **A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%**
* **Logic:** These students instinctively identify the structure of the expressions. They see the left as $8 + (12/4)$ and the right as $(8/4) + (12/4)$, instantly recognizing the left side must be larger without needing to do the full calculation.

### Teacher's Commentary
*   **The "C" Trap:** In UK classrooms, the most common error is the "Reading Method" (left to right). Lower-ability students see the same digits and operators and assume the answer is **C**, believing brackets are "optional" or just for decoration.
*   **The "A" Logic:** Left side is $8 + 3 = \mathbf{11}$. Right side is $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.
*   **Distractor D:** Is rarely chosen except by students who are guessing or misunderstand the symbol's meaning.
