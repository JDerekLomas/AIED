In the UK context, this question assesses the understanding of **reciprocals** and the **multiplication of directed numbers (signs)**.

Common misconceptions include:
*   **Reciprocal confusion:** Knowing the numbers must "flip" but forgetting the sign.
*   **Additive inverse confusion:** Thinking the answer should be the opposite sign of the original fraction (treating it like $x + (-3/4) = 0$).
*   **The "cancel out" fallacy:** Choosing $3/4$ or $-3/4$ because the numbers look familiar and they want the expression to disappear.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level (expressed in percentages):

**below_basic:** 
A=25% B=20% C=35% D=20%
*Likely to guess. C is often the most popular distractor here because students associate "making 1" with balancing the fraction's values but forget the negative sign entirely.*

**basic:** 
A=45% B=25% C=20% D=10%
*Students at this level often identify that they need to flip the fraction to $4/3$, but the "negative $\times$ negative = positive" rule is frequently misapplied. They may pick A because they think the negative sign in the question should be cancelled out by a positive.*

**proficient:** 
A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
*Most will recognise that a negative multiplied by a positive results in a negative, and that the reciprocal is required to reach an absolute value of 1. Those who miss it usually select A due to a hasty sign error.*

**advanced:** 
A=2% B=97% C=1% D=0%
*High-attaining students will instinctively identify the need for the multiplicative inverse (reciprocal) and correctly manage the signs. Errors here are almost exclusively down to "silly" misreads of the question.*
