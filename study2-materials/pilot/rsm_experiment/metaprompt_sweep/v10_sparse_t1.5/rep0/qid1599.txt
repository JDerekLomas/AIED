In the UK secondary curriculum (Key Stage 3 and 4), this question tests the transition from "arithmetic" thinking to "algebraic" notation, specifically the use of the vinculum (fraction bar) as a grouping symbol.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level (GCSE target grades 1–9).

**below_basic (Target Grades 1-2)**
*Focus: Misunderstanding of notation and basic transcription errors.*
**A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%**
*   **Rationale:** At this level, students often guess. **C** is a very common error because they may see "divided by $h$" and then just "add 4" at the end, failing to recognise the brackets. **D** represents a common confusion regarding which variable is the dividend and which is the divisor.

**basic (Target Grades 3-4)**
*Focus: Familiarity with fractions but struggling with grouping (BIDMAS).*
**A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%**
*   **Rationale:** More students recognise that division looks like a fraction (**A**), but many still choose **C** because they are used to working left-to-right and don't realise the fraction bar must cover the entire expression $(h+4)$. **B** is a "distractor" for students who think the $4$ must be applied to both terms.

**proficient (Target Grades 5-6)**
*Focus: Solid understanding of algebraic conventions.*
**A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%**
*   **Rationale:** Most students at this level understand that the vinculum acts as a bracket. The main "slip" remains **C**, often caused by rushing and not noticing the impact of the brackets in the original horizontal calculation.

**advanced (Target Grades 7-9)**
*Focus: Mastery of notation.*
**A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%**
*   **Rationale:** For high-achieving students, this is a "low-demand" retrieval task. Errors here are almost exclusively due to "silly mistakes" (optical slips) rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.

**Summary Table:**
**below_basic:** A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%
**basic:** A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%
**proficient:** A=75% B=05% C=15% D=05%
**advanced:** A=96% B=01% C=02% D=01%
