As a UK maths teacher, I would analyse the distractors based on common misconceptions regarding directed numbers and the FOIL method (Firsts, Outers, Inners, Lasts).

*   **Distractor A ($m^2 - 2m - 35$):** The "Difference" error. The student subtracts 5 from 7 to get the middle term and multiplies -5 and 7 to get -35 (sign error).
*   **Distractor C ($m^2 + 12m + 35$):** The "Everything is Positive" error. The student ignores the minus signs entirely or thinks "two negatives make a positive" applies to the addition in the middle.
*   **Distractor D ($m^2 - 12m - 35$):** The "Last Sign" error. The most common mistake where the student correctly adds $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$, but incorrectly thinks a negative multiplied by a negative is a negative.

Here are the predicted response distributions:

**below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%**
Students at this level struggle with directed numbers. Many will pick A because they simply find the difference between 5 and 7 ($2$) or pick C because they don't like dealing with negatives. Correct answers here are often lucky guesses.

**basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%**
Students understand the FOIL/Grid method process but frequently trip up on signs. "Negative times a negative is a positive" is often forgotten for the final term, leading them heavily toward D.

**proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%**
These students (Grade 4/5 at GCSE) usually remember the process. The majority will get it right, but a significant minority will still make the "negative times negative is negative" error for the constant term (D).

**advanced: A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%**
Students at this level (Grade 7+) perform these expansions fluently. Errors are usually down to "exam slip" or rushing rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.
