In the context of the UK National Curriculum, this question assesses a student's understanding of **order of operations** and **inverse operations** within algebra. It specifically targets a common misconception: whether a multiplication or division applied to one side of an equation must apply to *every* term or just the fraction.

### **Predicted Student Responses**

**below_basic**
*Students at this level often struggle with two-step equations and typically choose the operation they "see" first. They likely recognize Tom’s move (adding 5) as the standard first step taught in "flowchart" methods.*
*   **A: 55%** (Identify Tom’s step as "the way you do it.")
*   **B: 15%** (Miscalculate Katie’s 36 and think she's just wrong.)
*   **C: 10%** (Guessing.)
*   **D: 20%** (Confusion leads to a "neither" response.)

**basic**
*These students are comfortable with Tom's "add 5 to both sides." However, they usually hold a rigid view of algebra. They see Katie’s move as an "error" because they forget that multiplying the whole equation by 3 is mathematically valid, even if it’s not the most efficient path.*
*   **A: 65%** (Confident in Tom; certain Katie "forgot to multiply the 5.")
*   **B: 10%** (Misunderstanding the order of operations.)
*   **C: 15%** (Beginning to see algebraic equivalence.)
*   **D: 10%** (Overthinking the format.)

**proficient**
*Students here are fluent in two-step equations. The "distributive" nature of multiplication across an equation is the separator here. Many will still fall into the trap of thinking Katie is wrong because she didn't multiply the $-5$ by $3$.*
*   **A: 40%** (Still the most common answer due to the "rule" that you must multiply *everything*.)
*   **B: 5%** (Rare; they know Tom is correct.)
*   **C: 50%** (They recognize Katie's move is a valid algebraic manipulation, provided they check if $x-15=36$ was the intent. **Note:** In this specific question, Katie is actually **incorrect** because she didn't multiply the $-5$, but many proficient students might misread it or debate it.)
*   **D: 5%**

**advanced**
*Advanced students will look at Katie's line ($x-5=36$) and instantly spot the error. They know that if you multiply by 3, you must multiply the $-5$ as well to get $x-15=36$. Therefore, they will correctly identify that only Tom followed a valid step.*
*   **A: 85%** (Recognize Tom is correct and Katie failed to multiply all terms.)
*   **B: 2%** (Would not ignore Tom's obvious correct step.)
*   **C: 10%** (May rush and assume Katie is performing a "multiply by 3" step without checking the $-5$.)
*   **D: 3%**

### **Summary Table**

| Ability Level | A (Only Tom) | B (Only Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **below_basic** | 55% | 15% | 10% | 20% |
| **basic** | 65% | 10% | 15% | 10% |
| **proficient** | 40% | 5% | 50% | 5% |
| **advanced** | 85% | 2% | 10% | 3% |

**Teacher's Note:** The "Correct" answer is **A**. Tom added 5 to both sides ($12+5=17$). Katie attempted to multiply by 3, but failed to multiply the constant term $-5$ by 3, which would have resulted in $x-15=36$. Proficient students often score lower on this specific distractor (C) because they encourage the idea that there is "more than one way" to solve it, and may overlook the arithmetic error in Katie's specific line.
