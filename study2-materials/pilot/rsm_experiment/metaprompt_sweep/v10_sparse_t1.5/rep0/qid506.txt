Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on typical UK secondary school performance data (GCSE foundation/higher tiers).

### **The Common Pitfalls**
*   **A ($p = \frac{1}{4}$):** The "multiplication bias." Students see 3 and 12 and perform $12 \div 3$ because it results in a "clean" integer, ignoring that the 12 is in the denominator.
*   **B ($p = \frac{1}{36}$):** **The Correct Answer.** Requires understanding that to isolate $p$, you must divide by 3 (or multiply by $\frac{1}{3}$).
*   **C ($p = 4$):** Complete reversal. Students invert the fraction and divide 12 by 3.
*   **D ($p = \frac{1}{9}$):** Squaring or "magic" math. Students often associate $3 \times 3 = 9$ and try to apply it to the fraction erroneously.

**below_basic:** 
*Students at this level struggle with the concept of "doing the same to both sides" when fractions are involved. They will likely guess based on familiar number facts (3 and 12).*
**A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%**

**basic:**
*Students understand they need to divide by 3, but many will mistakenly divide the 12 by 3, resulting in Option A. Option C remains a popular distractor for those who struggle with reciprocal operations.*
**A=40% B=35% C=15% D=10%**

**proficient:**
*These students (Grade 4-5) recognize that dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying the denominator by 3. However, under time pressure, some will still fall for the "12 divided by 3" trap.*
**A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%**

**advanced:**
*These students (Grade 7+) see the structure of the equation immediately. Errors here are rare and usually down to simple misreads rather than conceptual misunderstanding.*
**A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%**
