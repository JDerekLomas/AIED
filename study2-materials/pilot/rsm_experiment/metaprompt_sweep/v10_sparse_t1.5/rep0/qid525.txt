Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on common misconceptions encountered in the UK KS3/KS4 curriculum.

**Distractor Analysis:**
*   **A ($ \frac{99}{20} $):** The correct value, but in the wrong format (improper fraction instead of mixed number).
*   **B ($ 4 \frac{19}{20} $):** The correct answer.
*   **C ($ \frac{99}{40} $):** Incorrect common denominator (multiplying 10 and 4 but not adjusting numerators correctly, or adding the denominators).
*   **D ($ 4 \frac{8}{14} $):** The classic "Add the whole numbers, add the numerators, add the denominators" error.

### **Predicted Responses by Ability Level**

**below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=25% D=50%**
*   **Logic:** At this level, students almost universally add across the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$), leading them directly to **D**. If they attempt a common denominator, they often multiply the two denominators together to get 40 but fail to scale the numerators, leading to **C**.

**basic: A=15% B=40% C=15% D=30%**
*   **Logic:** These students know they need a common denominator but often forget the step. **D** remains a strong "temptation." Many will successfully reach the value $4 \frac{19}{20}$ but some may convert everything to improper fractions first and stop at $ \frac{99}{20} $ (**A**), forgetting the instruction to leave it as a mixed number.

**proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%**
*   **Logic:** Proficient students (Grade 4/5) generally master the algorithm for adding fractions. Most will correctly find the common denominator of 20. The few errors here usually come from misreading the final instruction (selecting **A**) or a minor arithmetic slip in the numerator ($14+5$).

**advanced: A=2% B=97% C=0% D=1%**
*   **Logic:** Advanced students (Grade 7+) will find the common denominator mentally. The only likely error is a "silly mistake" or failing to read the "mixed number" requirement, though at this level, they are conditioned to look for the most "finished" looking form.
