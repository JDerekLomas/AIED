In a UK secondary school context (Key Stage 3 or 4), this question tests the ability to find a common denominator involving algebraic terms.

The correct answer is **A: $\frac{11}{2x}$**.

### Predicted Student Responses

**below_basic (Working at Grade 1–2 / KS3 Step 1-2)**
Students at this level often treat fractions as four independent numbers rather than parts of a whole. They are highly likely to add across the numerators and denominators.
*   **Prediction:** A=15% **B=60%** C=15% D=10%
*   **Logic for B:** They perform $(3+4) / (2x+x) = 7/3x$. This "add across" strategy is the most common misconception in fraction addition.

**basic (Working at Grade 3–4 / Foundation Tier)**
Students recognize they need a common denominator but often struggle with the execution or get confused by the $x$.
*   **Prediction:** A=35% B=25% **C=20%** **D=20%**
*   **Logic for C/D:** Many will try to make the denominators match but fail the "equivalent fraction" rule. They might change $4/x$ to $4/2x$ (forgetting to double the 4), leading to $7/2x$ (**D**). Or, they might mistakenly believe the $2$ in $2x$ "cancels out" if they multiply the second fraction by $2$, leading to an answer over $x$ (**C**).

**proficient (Working at Grade 5–6 / Intermediate)**
Students understand the need for a common denominator ($2x$) and know how to adjust the numerator. However, "careless" errors still occur under time pressure.
*   **Prediction: A=75%** B=5% C=5% D=15%
*   **Logic for D:** This is the "silly mistake" category. The student knows the denominator is $2x$, but simply adds $3+4$ without doubling the $4$ first.

**advanced (Working at Grade 7–9 / Higher Tier)**
Students at this level view this as a trivial task. Errors, if any, are usually due to misreading the question.
*   **Prediction: A=98%** B=0% C=1% D=1%
*   **Logic:** These students instinctively see $4/x$ as $8/2x$.
