This question is a classic diagnostic tool used in UK secondary schools (KS3 and GCSE) to identify misconceptions regarding **division commutativity** and **algebraic manipulation** when the variable is in the denominator.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses by ability level:

### **Predicted Student Responses**

| Ability Level | A (0.5) | B (50) | C (2) | D (None) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 40% | 35% | 5% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 15% | 35% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 5% | 10% | 0% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 1% | 0% |

### **Teacher Analysis & Rationales**

#### **Below Basic (Foundation Tier / Working Towards)**
*   **The B (50) Trap:** These students often see a '10' and a '5' and assume multiplication is required because "algebra is hard," leading them to $10 \times 5$.
*   **The C (2) Trap:** Students at this level frequently treat division as commutative (like addition). They calculate $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div p$.
*   **Guessing:** High interference from random selection due to lack of inverse operation knowledge.

#### **Basic (Low GCSE C-Grade / Level 4-5)**
*   **The C (2) Error:** This is the most common mistake for this cohort. They understand that $10$ and $5$ are related by a factor of $2$, but they perform $10 \div 5$ because it feels "natural" to divide the larger number by the smaller one.
*   **The A (0.5) Correct Answer:** Students who have mastered basic one-step equations start to realize that if $10p = 5$, then $p$ must be less than 1.
*   **The B (50) Error:** Some still default to multiplication if they can't remember the "swap" rule for denominators.

#### **Proficient (High GCSE / Level 6-7)**
*   **The A (0.5) Success:** These students typically use the "swap" method ($p = 5/10$) or multiply by $p$ and then divide by $10$. They have high fluency with fractions and decimals.
*   **The C (2) Careless Error:** Even at this level, students in a rush may quickly see $10$ and $5$ and instinctively write $2$ before re-reading the structure of the fraction.

#### **Advanced (A-Level Prospect / Level 8-9)**
*   **The A (0.5) Mastery:** These students identify the structure immediately. They may see it as a ratio ($10:1$ is the same as $5:0.5$) or solve it formally without algebraic "shortcuts."
*   **Minimal Errors:** Any errors here are usually "slip-ups" (transcription errors) rather than conceptual misunderstandings.
