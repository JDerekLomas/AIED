Here is a prediction of student responses based on typical UK Year 9/10 (KS3/KS4) performance data and common misconceptions regarding linear equations and substitution.

### Analysis of Distractors:
*   **A (20):** Calculated by multiplying $4 \times 5$ (from the 10 and 2). Often a result of "number grabbing."
*   **B (3):** Calculated by incorrectly solving $4(0) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 4 + 2y = 10$. Student treats $4(0)$ as $4$ rather than $0$.
*   **C (5):** **Correct answer.** $4(0) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 10 \rightarrow y = 5$.
*   **D (2.5):** Calculated by $10 \div 4$. Student ignores the $y$ coefficient or confuses the variables.

### Predicted Responses

**below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%**
Students at this level struggle with the concept of substitution and the presence of two variables. Many will pick **A** because they see the numbers 4, 2, and 10 and perform a random operation. They may also guess **C** simply because it "looks" like it fits a pattern $(0, 2, 4, 6...)$ without doing the algebra.

**basic: A=15% B=25% C=45% D=15%**
These students understand they need to substitute $x=0$. However, a significant portion will fall for the "Zero Property" error (treating $4 \times 0$ as $4$) leading them to answer **B**. Others might correctly identify that the $4x$ part disappears but fail at the final division.

**proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%**
Proficient students (Targeting GCSE Grade 4/5) are generally comfortable with substitution when one term becomes zero. Most will see that $2y = 10$, therefore $y = 5$. Errors here are usually due to rushing rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.

**advanced: A=0% B=2% C=97% D=1%**
Students at this level (Targeting GCSE Grade 7+) will solve this mentally almost instantly. The only errors would be "silly" slips or misreading the equation as $y = 4x + 10$ (which isn't offered as an option, so they would likely self-correct).
