As a UK maths teacher, I would expect the following distribution of responses based on typical student misconceptions at Key Stage 3 and 4 (GCSE).

The primary distractor for lower-ability students is confusing exponentiation with multiplication (yielding 12 or -12). For middle-ability students, the main hurdle is the "negative base" rule (yielding -81).

### **Predicted Student Responses**

**below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level often treat $k^4$ as $k \times 4$. They will likely calculate $-3 \times 4 = -12$ (Option D) or simply $3 \times 4 = 12$ (Option B). They have very little grasp of indices or negative number rules in this context.

**basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%**
*   **Reasoning:** These students recognise that $k^4$ means $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$, getting them to the digit 81. However, they almost universally believe that "a negative number stays negative" or they perform $(-3 \times -3) \times -3 \times -3$ and lose track of the signs, assuming the final answer must be negative (Option C).

**proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%**
*   **Reasoning:** Most students at this level (Grade 5/6) know that an even power results in a positive answer. They will correctly calculate 81. However, a significant portion will still be tripped up by "calculator logic"—if they typed $-3^4$ into a standard scientific calculator without brackets, it would show $-81$, and they often replicate this error in manual calculations.

**advanced: A=95% B=1% C=4% D=0%**
*   **Reasoning:** High-ability students (Grade 7+) are well-drilled in the substitution of negative numbers using brackets. They recognise that $(-3)^4$ means $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$, which results in positive 81. Errors here are usually due to rare computational slips rather than conceptual misunderstanding.
