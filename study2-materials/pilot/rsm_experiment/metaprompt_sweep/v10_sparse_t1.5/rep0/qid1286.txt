In the UK secondary context (GCSE/A-Level), this question tests the ability to recall the formula for the volume of a sphere ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) and successfully rearrange it to make $r$ the subject. 

Common errors include:
*   **A:** Incorrectly multiplying by 4 and $\pi$ instead of dividing.
*   **B:** Forgetting to move the 3 to the top (multiplying the whole equation by 3).
*   **D:** Misapplying the cube root only to the $V$ or failing to group the terms under the radical.

Here is the predicted distribution:

**below_basic:** A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
*These students often struggle to recall the formula correctly or lack the algebraic skills to perform inverse operations. Option A is a common "guess" because it groups the constants together.*

**basic:** A=25% B=30% C=30% D=15%
*Students at this level likely know the formula but struggle with the multi-step rearrangement (specifically the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$). Many will pick B because they see the 4 and 3 but aren't sure which one goes on top.*

**proficient:** A=10% B=15% C=65% D=10%
*Target Grade 5/6 students. Most will correctly identify that $3V$ is the first step of the rearrangement. Errors here are usually due to rushing or accidentally picking B by misreading the denominator.*

**advanced:** A=2% B=3% C=93% D=2%
*Target Grade 7-9 or A-Level students. These students have mastered literal equations and will fluently rearrange the formula to find C. Errors are usually down to "finger slips" or clerical errors.*
