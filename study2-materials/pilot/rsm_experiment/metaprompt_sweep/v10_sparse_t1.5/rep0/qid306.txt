In the UK secondary curriculum (Key Stage 3 and 4), students are taught the **BIDMAS** (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction) mnemonic. 

The common pitfalls are:
1.  **Left-to-Right bias:** Thinking math is always done like reading (leads to A).
2.  **BIDMAS Rigidity:** Believing Addition *must* come before Subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym (leads to D).

Here is the prediction of student responses by ability level:

**below_basic:** 
A=65% B=10% C=15% D=10%
*Reasoning:* These students almost exclusively work left-to-right. They rarely apply order of operations rules unless a bracket is visible. They will likely choose A because it "follows the order of the numbers."

**basic:** 
A=25% B=20% C=15% D=40%
*Reasoning:* This group knows the BIDMAS acronym but over-applies it. They correctly identify $5 \times 6$ is first in Problem Q, but they fall into the "Addition before Subtraction" trap for Problem P, leading them to Option D.

**proficient:** 
A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
*Reasoning:* Most students at this level understand that Multiplication precedes Addition. However, a significant portion still struggles with the "Addition and Subtraction are equal priority" rule, meaning many will still gravitate toward D.

**advanced:** 
A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%
*Reasoning:* Advanced students recognize that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and are solved left-to-right. They also comfortably identify that Multiplication takes precedence in Problem Q. Only a small minority will make a "slips" or hold onto the rigid BIDMAS ordering.
