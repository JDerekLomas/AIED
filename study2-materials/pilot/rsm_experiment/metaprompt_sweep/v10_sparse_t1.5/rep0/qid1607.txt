In the UK secondary curriculum, this question targets **KS3/GCSE Algebra (solving linear equations)**. 

The mathematical "trap" here is the inverse operation in Step 2. While Isaac correctly multiplies by 4 in Step 1, he incorrectly adds 1 instead of subtracting 1 in Step 2.

Here is the prediction of student responses based on typical classroom data and common misconceptions (such as "doing the same to both sides" but using the wrong operation).

**Correct Answer: A**

***

**below_basic:** A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level often struggle with multi-step logic. Many will choose **C** because the numbers "look right" ($60+1=61$). They see a 60 and a 1 and instinctively add them without considering the algebraic rules of inverse operations.

**basic:** A=40% B=10% C=35% D=15%
*   **Reasoning:** These students usually recognise that Step 1 is correct (multiplying $15 \times 4$). However, a significant portion will still fall for the "plus/minus" trap in Step 2. They know they need to "move the 1," but they use the sign currently in front of the $k$ rather than the inverse operation.

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** Proficient students (Grade 4/5) are generally reliable at solving two-step equations. Most will spot that Step 2 should be $k = 59$. The 15% choosing **C** are likely rushing or performing a "visual check" rather than solving it on paper.

**advanced:** A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
*   **Reasoning:** Students working at Grade 7+ will find this a very simple "spot the mistake" problem. Errors here are almost exclusively down to "silly mistakes" (reading the question too quickly) rather than a lack of algebraic understanding.

### Summary of Misconceptions
*   **Step 1:** Rarely flagged as incorrect because "15 times 4 is 60" is a familiar calculation.
*   **Step 2:** The "Additive Inverse" error. Students see $+1$ and instinctively think of the next number in the sequence ($60, 61$) rather than the inverse operation ($-1$).
