Here are the predicted response percentages for UK students based on the national curriculum expectations for Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3.

**Common Misconceptions behind the options:**
*   **A:** Correct application of adding whole numbers and parts.
*   **B:** Correct sum, but converted to an improper fraction (ignoring the "leave as mixed number" instruction).
*   **C:** Adding both the numerators AND the denominators ($1+2=3, 5+5=10$) and ignoring the whole numbers.
*   **D:** Correct addition of whole numbers and numerators, but incorrectly adding the denominators ($5+5=10$).

### **Teacher Commentary**

*   **Below Basic (Working Towards):** Students at this level often treat the fraction as four separate integers. The most common error is **C**, where they add everything in sight (1+2 and 5+5). They lack the conceptual understanding that the denominator represents the "size" of the parts and shouldn't be added.
*   **Basic (Expected Standard):** These students usually know to add the whole numbers (2+1=3). However, the "Add the Denominator" trap (**D**) remains highly seductive. About a third of students at this level will consistently provide $3 \frac{3}{10}$ as their answer.
*   **Proficient (Greater Depth):** These students have mastered the algorithm for common denominators. The main pitfall here is **B**. Some students are so habituated to converting mixed numbers into improper fractions as their "first step" for all fraction work that they provide the improper version and forget to convert it back as requested.
*   **Advanced:** These students will identify the common denominators immediately. Their only errors would be due to "careless reading" of the instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number, though at this level, that is rare.
