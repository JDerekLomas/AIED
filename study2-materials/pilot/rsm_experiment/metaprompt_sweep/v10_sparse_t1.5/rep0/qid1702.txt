As a UK maths teacher, I would categorize this as a **GCSE Foundation/Higher Tier crossover question** (typically Grade 4/5 difficulty). It tests the ability to substitute into a linear equation and rearrange to find an unknown, often involving decimal arithmetic and directed numbers.

The star represents $x$ when $y = 0.5$.
Calculation: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 33 \rightarrow x = 3.3$.

Here is the prediction of student responses by ability level:

**below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=20% D=30%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level struggle with formal substitution and balancing equations. Many will pick **A** because they perform a "random" operation with the numbers seen ($30 + 6 + 6.5 + 0.5 \dots$) or try to solve for $y$ despite $y$ being given. Option **D** is a common distractor for students who calculate $30 - 3 = 27$ then divide by 10, failing to "add" the 3 to the other side when rearranging.

**basic: A=20% B=10% C=45% D=25%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students have a grasp of substitution but often make "sign errors" or errors in the order of operations. Option **C** becomes the modal answer, but many will still choose **D** because they move the $-3$ across the equals sign and subtract it (getting $27$) rather than adding it.

**proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%**
*   **Reasoning:** These students (aiming for Grade 5/6) generally know the process: Substitute $0.5$, calculate $3$, add $3$ to $30$, and divide by $10$. Errors here are usually due to "silly" arithmetic mistakes rather than a lack of understanding of the algebraic process.

**advanced: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%**
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level (Grade 7+) will find this straightforward. They will instinctively move from $10x - 3 = 30$ to $x = 3.3$ mentally or with minimal working. Outliers are purely down to misreading the question (e.g., swapping $x$ and $y$).
