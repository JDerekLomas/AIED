In the context of the UK National Curriculum, this question tests a student's ability to handle **indices (squaring decimals)** and **substitution (order of operations/BIDMAS)**.

The correct calculation is $3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

### Predicted Responses by Ability Level

**below_basic (Working at KS3 Level 3-4 / Grade 1-2)**
*   **A (0.81):** 40% — This is the most common error. The student multiplies 3 by 0.3 first to get 0.9, then squares 0.9. They lack understanding of BIDMAS/Indices priority.
*   **B (0.27):** 10% — Likely a lucky guess or rudimentary calculator use.
*   **C (1.8):** 30% — The student confuses $x^2$ with $2x$. They calculate $3 \times (0.3 \times 2) = 1.8$ or even $0.3^2 = 0.6$, then $3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$.
*   **D (2.7):** 20% — The student thinks $(0.3)^2 = 0.9$, then calculates $3 \times 0.9$. A common decimal placement error.

**basic (Working at GCSE Grade 3-4)**
*   **A (0.81):** 35% — The "brackets/multiplication first" error (BIDMAS) is still very prevalent here.
*   **B (0.27):** 30% — Starting to understand that squaring comes first, but decimal place value remains a hurdle.
*   **C (1.8):** 15% — The "multiply by 2" instead of "square" misconception.
*   **D (2.7):** 20% — Incorrectly squaring $0.3$ as $0.9$. This is the "mental math" trap for this tier.

**proficient (Working at GCSE Grade 5-6)**
*   **A (0.81):** 15% — Occurs when rushing (the $(3x)^2$ trap).
*   **B (0.27):** 65% — Students at this level generally know BIDMAS and can accurately square $0.3$ to get $0.09$.
*   **C (1.8):** 5% — Rare at this level.
*   **D (2.7):** 15% — The most common distraction for proficient students is misplacing the decimal point when squaring $0.3$.

**advanced (Working at GCSE Grade 7-9)**
*   **A (0.81):** 2% — Very rare careless error.
*   **B (0.27):** 95% — High fluency with substitution and decimals.
*   **C (1.8):** 1% — Misreading the power.
*   **D (2.7):** 2% — A rare slip-up in mental arithmetic regarding the decimal place.
