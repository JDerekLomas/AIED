In the UK secondary mathematics context (KS3/KS4), this question tests two distinct skills: **Order of Operations (BIDMAS)** and **Directed Numbers (Arithmetic with Negatives)**.

The correct calculation is: $3 - 5 + (4 \times 2) \rightarrow 3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = \mathbf{6}$ (Option A).

### Error Analysis:
*   **A (6):** Correct application of BIDMAS and negative number arithmetic.
*   **B (4):** BIDMAS applied, but calculation error: $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 8$ mistakenly calculated as $10 - 6$ or similar confusion with the signs.
*   **C (-12):** Left-to-right processing (Ignoring BIDMAS): $(3 - 5) + 4 \times 2 \rightarrow -2 + 4 \times 2 \rightarrow 2 \times 2 = 4$ (No), or more likely $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times -?$. Actually, C is often reached by $(3 - 5 + 4) \times 2 = 4$, or miscalculating $3 - (5+8) = 3 - 13 = -10$.
*   **D (-10):** Common BIDMAS error: Treating Addition as having priority over Subtraction (the 'A' before 'S' trap): $3 - (5 + 8) = 3 - 13 = -10$.

### Predicted Responses by Ability Level

**below_basic (Working towards Grade 1-2)**
*Students at this level often ignore BIDMAS entirely or struggle significantly with negative integers.*
**A=15% B=20% C=30% D=35%**
*   **Logic:** Most will work strictly left-to-right. $3-5$ becomes $2$ or $-2$. They often add $5+4$ first because it's "easier" than dealing with the minus sign, leading to D.

**basic (Working towards Grade 3-4)**
*Students know the acronym BIDMAS but apply it rigidly/literally.*
**A=30% B=15% C=10% D=45%**
*   **Logic:** This is the "BIDMAS Trap" zone. Because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym, they will almost certainly do $5+8=13$ first, then $3-13 = -10$. They believe they are following the rules correctly.

**proficient (Working towards Grade 5-6)**
*Students understand that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and are competent with negatives.*
**A=75% B=10% C=5% D=10%**
*   **Logic:** Most will identify the multiplication first. The primary source of error here is a "slip" in directed number arithmetic (e.g., $-2 + 8 = -6$ or $10$).

**advanced (Working towards Grade 7+)**
*Students have automated the order of operations and rarely make sign errors.*
**A=96% B=2% C=1% D=1%**
*   **Logic:** Only a careless "speed error" would lead to a wrong answer here. They recognize $3 - 5 + 8$ as a simple linear calculation.
