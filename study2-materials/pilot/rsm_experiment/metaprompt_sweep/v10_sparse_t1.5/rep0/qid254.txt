As a UK maths teacher, this question is a classic "trap" designed to test a student's understanding of the role of **zero** in statistics and **BIDMAS/Order of Operations**.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

**below_basic:** 
A=30% B=15% C=50% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** Many students at this level believe that zero "doesn't count." They will add the non-zero digits and divide by 4 (Option C). Option A is also popular because they recognise the need to divide by 5 but visually disregard the 0 in the numerator.

**basic:** 
A=55% B=20% C=20% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** At this level, students know there are 5 numbers, so they look for a division by 5. Option A looks "correct enough" because adding 0 doesn't change the sum. A significant portion will choose B because it matches how they would type it into a non-scientific calculator, unaware of BIDMAS errors.

**proficient:** 
A=75% B=10% C=5% D=10%
*   **Reasoning:** Most students at this level understand that the 0 must be included in the count of numbers ($n=5$). Since $0+1+3+4+7$ is mathematically identical to $1+3+4+7$ in terms of result, they will identify **A** as the functionally correct calculation. Some might hesitate and choose D if they are strictly looking for the 0 to be written in the numerator.

**advanced:** 
A=92% B=2% C=1% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** These students recognise that Option A is mathematically sound ($15/5 = 3$). They will instantly dismiss B due to the lack of brackets (BIDMAS would only divide the 7 by 5) and dismiss C for the incorrect divisor. A few "perfectionists" might choose D because the 0 is missing from the expression, but most will accept A as the only valid identity.

### Summary Table

| Ability Level | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **below_basic** | 30% | 15% | 50% | 5% |
| **basic** | 55% | 20% | 20% | 5% |
| **proficient** | 75% | 10% | 5% | 10% |
| **advanced** | 92% | 2% | 1% | 5% |

**Correct Answer: A** (While 0 is not written, $0+1+3+4+7 = 1+3+4+7$, and the divisor of 5 correctly accounts for the 0 in the data set.)
