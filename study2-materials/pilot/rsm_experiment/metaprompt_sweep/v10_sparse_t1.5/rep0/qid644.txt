In the UK secondary mathematics context (KS3/KS4), this question tests two specific skills: the ability to identify that "expansion" involves multiplication, and the ability to multiply two negative integers.

Common misconceptions include:
*   **Additive Misconception:** Adding $-1$ and $-4$ to get $-5$ or $+5$.
*   **Sign Error:** Correct multiplication of digits ($1 \times 4$) but failing the "negative $\times$ negative = positive" rule.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses by ability level:

### **Below Basic (Low Progress / Target Grade 1-2)**
*Students at this level often confuse the operations required for expansion or struggle with basic directed number rules.*
**A=20% | B=30% | C=10% | D=40%**
*   **Logic:** The most common error here is **D**. These students see $-1$ and $-4$ and instinctively add them together ($1 + 4 = 5$ and keep the sign). Some pick **B** because they remember to multiply but forget that two negatives make a positive.

### **Basic (Emerging / Target Grade 3-4)**
*Students have started to link 'brackets' with multiplication but frequently make sign errors.*
**A=40% | B=35% | C=5% | D=20%**
*   **Logic:** A large portion will now correctly identify multiplication. However, the "negative $\times$ negative" rule is notoriously unstable at this level. There is a high chance of them selecting **B** ($-4$). Some will still fall for the additive trap (**D**).

### **Proficient (Secure / Target Grade 5-6)**
*Students are familiar with FOIL/Grid method and are generally confident with directed numbers.*
**A=75% | B=15% | C=2% | D=8%**
*   **Logic:** Most will correctly identify that $-1 \times -4 = +4$. The remaining errors usually come from rushing (sign error resulting in **B**) or a momentary lapse into addition (**D**).

### **Advanced (High Achiever / Target Grade 7-9)**
*Students have mastered the distributive law and integer arithmetic.*
**A=96% | B=2% | C=1% | D=1%**
*   **Logic:** At this level, anything other than **A** is usually a "slip" (reading the numbers too quickly) rather than a lack of conceptual understanding. They will instinctively apply the "two negatives make a positive" rule correctly.
