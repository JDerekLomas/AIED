Here is my prediction based on the common misconceptions I see daily in my Year 9 classroom.

I expect a heavy lean toward option B and D. Many students will handle the squaring incorrectly or apply the multiplication before the index (BIDMAS error). Those who see $3 \times 3 \times 3$ will reflexively jump to a variation of 27.

**Why they will get it wrong:**
*   **The "Double it" trap:** Some lower-ability students still struggle with the concept of squaring, often doubling the base ($0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$) then multiplying by 3 to get $1.8$.
*   **The BIDMAS slip:** Many mid-range students will do $(3 \times 0.3)^2$, resulting in $0.9^2 = 0.81$. They see the $3x$ as a single unit to be squared.
*   **The Decimal point disaster:** The most common error will be $0.3^2 = 0.9$. They know $3 \times 3 = 9$ and assume one decimal place stays as one decimal place. This leads them to $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$. 
*   **The Triple 3:** A few will do $3 \times 0.3 \times 0.3$ but lose track of the place value, resulting in $0.27$.

**The Prediction:**
