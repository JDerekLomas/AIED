Here is the predicted distribution for your Year 9 class, based on typical misconceptions regarding BIDMAS/BODMAS and the distributive property.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The "Visual Pattern" Trap:** Many students in the lower brackets will see $8+12$ on both sides. They ignore the brackets and the division order, assuming that because the numbers are the same, the result must be equal (Choice C).
*   **Left-to-Right Linear Processing:** Students often ignore BIDMAS and calculate $8+12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$ for the left side. This leads them to conclude $5 = 5$, firmly landing them on Choice C.
*   **The "Bigger is Better" Intuition:** Students who struggle with operations often perceive the right side as "bigger" because the brackets group the addition first, creating a large number (20) before it is shrunk by the division.
*   **Miscounting the LHS:** Proficient students will correctly identify the left side as $8+3=11$ and the right side as $20 \div 4 = 5$, correctly selecting A.
