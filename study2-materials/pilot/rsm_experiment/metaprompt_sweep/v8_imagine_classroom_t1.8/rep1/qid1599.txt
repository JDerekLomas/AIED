As your teacher, I know exactly how this is going to play out across the different desks in the room.

The **Advanced** group (your Oscar and Maya types) will find this trivial. They treat the division sign and the fraction bar as synonymous. The only "danger" for them is overthinking whether they need to expand the denominator, which isn't an option here.

The **Proficient** group (the steady middle) will largely get it right, though a few like Leo might see the "c" and the "4" and reflexively think they need to do "something" to the numbers, drifting toward B.

The **Basic** group is where the "visual noise" of algebra takes over. They often struggle with the "order of operations" in a fraction. Many will pick **D** because they subconsciously prefer the heavier expression (h+4) to be on top, or they just get the divisor and dividend swapped. 

The **Below Basic** group will be a total split. Students like Chloe will pick **C** because they see "c ÷ h" and just "tack on the +4" at the end, ignoring the brackets entirely. The brackets feel like an annoyance they can just solve left-to-right. Others will pick **B** simply because it "looks more like a full equation."

Here is my predicted distribution based on our class profile:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=10% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=0% D=10%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
