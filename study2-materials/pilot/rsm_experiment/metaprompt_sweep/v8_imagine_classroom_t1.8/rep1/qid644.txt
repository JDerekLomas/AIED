Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 class, based on common cognitive traps regarding negative numbers and operational confusion.

**The Logic Behind the Prediction:**
*   **A (Correct):** Students who remember "two minuses make a plus" and "expand means multiply."
*   **B (-4):** A very common error. Students see the $1$ and the $4$ and know that $1 \times 4 = 4$, but they see two minus signs and their brain tells them the answer *must* be negative because the numbers they are looking at are negative. They lose the rule under pressure.
*   **C (+5):** These students are "additive thinkers." Even though we are expanding brackets, they see $-1$ and $-4$ and their brain performs addition ($1 + 4$).
*   **D (-5):** This is the "classic" Year 9 mistake for this topic. These students understand that they are combining $-1$ and $-4$, but they use the rules for **collecting like terms** (addition/subtraction) instead of **expanding** (multiplication). They think: "I owe a pound, I borrow four more, I owe five pounds."
