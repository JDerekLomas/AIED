In this Year 9 class, the common pitfalls will be "adding across" (adding numerators and denominators) and failing to read the instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number.

**Below Basic (6 students):** These students often see fractions as four independent numbers. **Leo and Sarah** will immediately choose **D** because $7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$. It feels "right" and doesn't require finding a common denominator, which they find intimidating.

**Basic (9 students):** These students know they need a common denominator but will likely use 40 instead of 20. **Harvey** will calculate $4 \frac{28+10}{40} = 4 \frac{38}{40}$. Not seeing that exact mixed number, he might panic and choose **C** because it has 40 in the denominator, or successfully simplify to **B** if he keeps his cool. **Tyler** will do the hard work of converting to improper fractions ($27/10 + 9/4$), get $99/20$, and pick **A** because he forgot to read the "mixed number" instruction.

**Proficient (10 students):** Most like **Amelie and Jake** will comfortably find the common denominator of 20 and reach $4 \frac{19}{20}$. A couple might lose a mark by converting to $99/20$ and stopping there (**A**).

**Advanced (5 students):** These students like **Maya** will mentally process this in seconds. They will look for $19/20$ and $4$ immediately. The only risk is "over-thinking" and accidentally selecting A if they are rushing to get to the next question, but most will follow the format instructions perfectly.
