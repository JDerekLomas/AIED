To predict the outcome for my Year 9s, I have to look at the classic "algebraic fraction" traps. This isn't just about addition; it’s about how students perceive the relationship between the denominator and the numerator when there is a variable involved.

**The Mistakes & Student Logic:**
*   **The "Add Across" Group (Option B):** These students treat fractions like they are lists of numbers. They see $3+4$ and $2x+x$. Their brains tell them to simplify by grouping like terms horizontally. These are my students who are still shaky on common denominators and view $x$ as just another number to be added.
*   **The "Double it but forget the top" Group (Option D):** These students recognize the common denominator needs to be $2x$. They successfully transform the second fraction's denominator to $2x$, but in their rush, they forget to multiply the numerator (4) by 2. They add $3+4$ over the new denominator.
*   **The "I forgot how to add fractions" Group (Option C):** Usually a result of a total brain-fade where they think they can cancel the $x$ or they just focus on the $4/x$ and ignore the $2x$ entirely.
