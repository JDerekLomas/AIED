To set the scene for my Year 9s: This is a classic "changing the subject of the formula" question masquerading as a geometry problem. Even though we’ve covered volume, the moment you remove the numbers and leave them with variables and cube roots, half the class will panic.

**Predicting the mental hurdles:**
*   **The "Top-Heavy" Trap (A):** Students like Chloe and Jack often struggle with fraction division. They know the formula involves $4/3$, and in their heads, they "move" it by multiplying by $4/3$ instead of multiplying by $3$ and dividing by $4$. They see $\frac{4}{3}$ in the original formula and look for $\frac{4}{3}$ in the answer.
*   **The "Pi Problem" (B):** This is for my middle-attainers who know the $\pi$ is on the top of the fraction in the volume formula, so they assume it stays "important" on top, or they simply lose track of it during the rearrangement. 
*   **The "Linear Thinkers" (D):** This is for Leo, who hates roots. He might try to pull the $3/4$ out from under the root or just pick the one that looks the "cleanest" without the root symbol covering the whole fraction.
*   **The Correct Path (C):** My higher-ability students like Aisha and Sam will systematically multiply by 3, divide by $4\pi$, and then apply the cube root.

Here is my predicted distribution for my 30 students:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=30% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=95% D=0%
