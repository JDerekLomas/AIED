**Predictive Analysis:**

My **below_basic** students (the "bottom set" triers) are likely to go for **B**. To them, the "3" at the bottom looks annoying, and their instinct is to multiply everything by 3 to "get rid of the fraction." However, they lack the conceptual understanding of distribution; they will multiply the 12 but completely forget that the $-5$ must also be multiplied. To them, Katie's line looks "cleaner."

My **basic** and **proficient** students are most likely to choose **A**. They have been drilled in the "Change Side, Change Sign" or "Balance" method. They see the $-5$, they want to $+5$ it to the other side immediately. This is the standard procedure they've mastered. Because they are so focused on the step-by-step algorithm, they will view Katie’s line as "breaking the rules." They think you *must* move the 5 first, and therefore conclude Katie is wrong.

My **advanced** students are the only ones who will think about "both." They’ll realise that while Katie’s method is unconventional and slightly "messier" (usually leading to $x-15=36$), the question asks if it *could* be a correct next line. They will spot that if you multiply the *entire* equation by 3, you get $x - 15 = 36$. Many will initially fall for the trap and pick A, but the top-tier thinkers will catch that Katie has failed to multiply the 5, leading them back to A. However, a specific group of high-achievers often "over-think" Katie's logic—wondering if there's a different way to represent the equation—but ultimately, the strongest students will correctly identify that Katie is wrong because she didn't multiply the $-5$, and they will join the proficient group in picking **A**. 

**The real "sting" in this question?** Most of the class will pick **A** for the right reason (Tom is right), but they will incorrectly assume Katie is wrong simply because she did the "wrong step first," rather than noticing she did the "right step (multiplying by 3) mathematically incorrectly."
