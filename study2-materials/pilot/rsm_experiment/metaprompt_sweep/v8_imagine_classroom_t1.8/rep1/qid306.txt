Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30 students.

**Teacher's Insight:**
The "trap" here isn't Problem Q (most Year 9s have BIDMAS drilled in for multiplication); it’s the **'A' in BIDMAS**. Students often think Addition *must* come before Subtraction because the letter A comes before S. This leads them to prioritize \(5+6\) in Problem P, despite the rule that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right.

**Predicting the "Whys":**
*   **The "BIDMAS Robots" (Option D):** These students (mostly in the Basic/Proficient categories) will confidently choose D because they are following the acronym literally. They see the "+" in \(4-5+6\) and think, "Addition first, always."
*   **The Left-to-Right Group (Option B):** These are my solid thinkers who understand that P is a string of equal-priority operations, but they often get tripped up if they overthink the acronym.
*   **The Left-to-Right Purists (Option A):** These students forget order of operations entirely and just read both problems like a sentence.

basic: A=15% B=25% C=5% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=55% C=0% D=40%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
