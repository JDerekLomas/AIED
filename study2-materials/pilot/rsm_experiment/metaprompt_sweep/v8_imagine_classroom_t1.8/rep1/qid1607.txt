In my Year 9 class, this is a classic "balancing vs. arithmetic" trap. Even the students who can solve equations often trip up on Isaac's mistake in Step 2 because it looks "mathsy" enough to be right at a glance.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**

*   **The "Plus means Plus" Error (The common mistake):** In Step 2, many students will see the $+1$ and instinctively think they need to add it to the 60. Their brains are on autopilot: they see "1" and "60" and "k", and their hand writes 61 before their logic kicks in to do the inverse operation. This is why Option C is the most dangerous distractor.
*   **The "One-Step Wonder":** Some students (my lower ability ones) will be so impressed that Isaac correctly multiplied 15 by 4 that they'll assume the rest of the question must be right too. They won't even look closely at Step 2.
*   **The Over-thinkers:** A few students might think Step 1 is wrong because they've been taught to subtract the 1 *before* dealing with the fraction (even though that's not possible here without messy decimals), leading them to pick D.

**The Predicted Distribution:**
