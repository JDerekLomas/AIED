To a teacher, this is a classic "inverted operation" trap. Many Year 9s don't actually read the algebraic structure; they perform a mental "scan" for numbers and choose an operation that feels natural. They see 10 and 5 and their brain shouts "2" before they’ve even looked at the denominator.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The "Divide the Big by the Small" instinct (The C-Trap):** Even my mid-range students often default to "What is 10 divided by 5?" or "5 times what is 10?" They are used to $x$ being the numerator or the subject. To them, the relationship between 10, 5, and 2 is so strong it overrides the fraction line.
*   **The "Linear Move" (The B-Trap):** Some students recognise they need to multiply to get rid of the fraction, but then they multiply 10 by 5, leading them to $p=50$. They don't realise they've effectively solved $10 = p/5$.
*   **The "Half" logic (The A-correctors):** The advanced students will realise $10$ is double $5$, so $p$ must be a half.

**The Prediction:**

below_basic: A=5% B=30% C=60% D=5%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=50% B=15% C=35% D=0%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
