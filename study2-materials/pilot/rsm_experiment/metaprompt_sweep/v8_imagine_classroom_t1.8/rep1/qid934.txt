To give you the context behind these numbers: **C (5)** is the correct answer, but this question is a "trap" for Year 9s who are used to equations starting with $y=...$

The **"Below Basic"** group (e.g., Tyler or Chloe) will see the $4$, the $x=0$, and the $10$ and just add or multiply them without logic, or they'll see the $2y=10$ part and perform $10 \div 4$ because they are fixated on the coefficient of $x$. **A (20)** is a common "blind" answer where they multiply $4 \times 5$.

The **"Basic"** group (e.g., Leo) will often pick **B (3)**. Why? Because they assume $x$ and $y$ follow a simple pattern. They look at $4x+2y=10$, see the numbers 4, 2, and 10, and subconsciously expect the answer to be something small that "fits" a sequence, or they'll try to solve for $y$ but lose a minus sign or divide by 2 then add 1.

The **"Proficient"** group (the bulk of the class) will get it right, but a significant number will fall for **D (2.5)**. This is the most common "smart" mistake. They will correctly identify they need to divide 10 by something, but they'll divide $10$ by the $4$ (the first coefficient they see) rather than the $2$.

The **"Advanced"** group (e.g., Maya) will see that $x=0$ makes the $4x$ term vanish instantly, leaving a simple one-step equation.

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=0% B=15% C=65% D=20%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
