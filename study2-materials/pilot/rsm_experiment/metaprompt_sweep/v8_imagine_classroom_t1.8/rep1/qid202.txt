Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 class of 30 students. 

**The Rationale:**
*   **The Trap (Option B):** My "Proficient" kids often over-complicate things. They’ve had "change to improper fractions" drilled into them so hard for multiplication that they’ll do it here by habit. They'll get $\frac{18}{5}$ and stop, forgetting the instruction to leave it as a mixed number.
*   **The Classic Error (Option D):** My "Basic" group will add the whole numbers (3) and the numerators (3), but their instinct to "add everything" will lead them to add the denominators ($5+5=10$). It feels "fairer" to them.
*   **The Guess (Option C):** My "Below Basic" students will often just perform any operation on all four visible small numbers ($2+1+2+3$) or get overwhelmed by the notation and pick the one with the biggest denominator.

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=10% C=0% D=40%
proficient: A=70% B=25% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
