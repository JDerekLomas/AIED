To give you the predicted breakdown for a typical mixed-ability Year 9 class, I have categorized the students based on their current working levels. This specific question is a "classic" trap because it involves dividing a fraction by an integer, which triggers specific misconceptions about whether the denominator gets smaller or larger.

Here is how I predict my class will perform:

**below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=30% D=0%**
*   **The Logic:** My "Below Basic" group will almost exclusively look at the numbers $3$ and $12$ and try to find a shortcut. Most will choose **A** because their brain says "12 divided by 3 is 4," and they keep it as a fraction. Those who choose **C** are simply doing $12 \div 3 = 4$ and ignoring the fact that it was $1/12$. They won't even consider B or D as they "feel" like too much work.

**basic: A=45% B=40% C=5% D=10%**
*   **The Logic:** This group is the most dangerous. They know they need to "divide by 3." However, many still struggle with the mechanics of fractions. About half will see the $12$ and the $3$ and impulsively go to **A** because $12 \div 3 = 4$ feels more "right" than $12 \times 3 = 36$. Those who get it right (**B**) are usually the ones who literally write out "$\div 3$" on their paper and remember that dividing a fraction means the denominator grows. A few will pick **D** because they get confused with $3^2$.

**proficient: A=10% B=85% C=0% D=5%**
*   **The Logic:** These students have mastered the "keep, change, flip" or the rule that dividing by a whole number is the same as multiplying the denominator. The 10% picking **A** are my "silly mistake" culprits—the ones who work too fast and think $1/12 \div 3$ is "a third of 12" instead of "a third of a twelfth."

**advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%**
*   **The Logic:** My Advanced group will find this trivial. They will instantly see the relationship as $p = \frac{1}{12 \times 3}$. They are unlikely to be tripped up by the arithmetic.
