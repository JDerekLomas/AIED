Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9s. Even though the maths seems straightforward, negative indices and powers are a classic "banana skin" for this age group.

**The "Why":**
*   **The B and D trap:** These are the "multipliers." About 15-20% of the class (mostly my 'below_basic' and 'basic' students) will instinctively do $3 \times 4$ because they see two numbers and their brain takes the path of least resistance.
*   **The C trap (The "Negative Rule" confusion):** This is the most common error for middle-attainers. They correctly calculate $3^4 = 81$, but they see a negative in the question and assume the answer must be negative. They have "learnt" that $(-3)^2$ is $9$, but for some reason, their working memory fails them on higher powers, or they are subconsciously applying the rule for $(-1) \times (81)$.
*   **The Advanced trick:** My top-set students will breeze through this, but even then, one or two might rush and pick C because they’ve been over-drilling linear equations where negative signs persist.

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=0% C=25% D=0%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
