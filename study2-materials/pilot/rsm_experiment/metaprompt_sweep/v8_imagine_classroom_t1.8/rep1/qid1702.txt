To predict the results for this Year 9 class, I’m looking at the specific pitfalls of this linear equation. 

For the **below_basic** group (about 6 students), they will likely struggle with the substitution and the negative sign. Many will try to "do something" with 30, 10, and 6, or they will substitute 0.5 for $x$ instead of $y$. Others will perform $30 \div 10$ and ignore the $y$ term entirely, or guess $3.3$ (C) because $10/3 \approx 3.33$.

For the **basic** group (about 10 students), the "0.5" is a trap. They will correctly substitute $y = 0.5$ but falter at the negative. They'll do $6 \times 0.5 = 3$, but instead of adding it to 30 ($10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33$), they will subtract it ($10x + 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 27$). This makes **D** the most common wrong answer.

For the **proficient** group (about 10 students), most will get the correct answer (C), but some will perform the inverse operation incorrectly. They see $-6y$ and $y=0.5$ as $-3$, but in their hurry to rearrange $10x - 3 = 30$, they might mistakenly think they need to move the 10 first or treat it as $30 - 3 = 27$.

The **advanced** group (4 students) will see that $6 \times 0.5 = 3$, add it to 30 to get 33, and divide by 10 to get 3.3.

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=35% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=30% D=60%
proficient: A=0% B=5% C=80% D=15%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
