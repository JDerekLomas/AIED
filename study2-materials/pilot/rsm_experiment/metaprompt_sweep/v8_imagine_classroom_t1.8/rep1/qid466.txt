Based on my experience with Year 9, this is a classic "sign vs. reciprocal" trap. Even students who know how to multiply fractions often get bamboozled by the interplay between the negative result and the negative multiplicand.

The biggest hurdle isn't the arithmetic; it's the cognitive load of balancing the rule "flip the fraction to get 1" against the rule "a negative times a positive is a negative."

**The Breakdown:**
*   **The "Double Negative" Mistake:** My mid-range students often panic when they see negatives and "over-correct." They know they need a negative result, so they instinctively reach for a negative star, forgetting that two negatives would make the result positive 1.
*   **The Reciprocal Reflex:** My stronger students will see $-1$ and think "reciprocal" immediately, but about 20% of them will move too fast and pick B because they think they need to keep the sign the same as the original fraction to "match" the negative energy of the equation.

Here is how I expect my class of 30 to respond:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=40% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=20% C=5% D=0%
advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
