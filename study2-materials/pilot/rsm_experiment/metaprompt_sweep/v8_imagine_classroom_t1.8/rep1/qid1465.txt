Here is the predicted distribution and analysis for my Year 9 class of 30.

**below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=55% D=20%**
These students (like *Leo* and *Sasha*) often view math as a "left-to-right" reading exercise. They will ignore BODMAS entirely: $3-5$ is $-2$, add $4$ is $2$, multiplied by $2$ is **4 (B)**. However, the majority will fall into the "Addition before Subtraction" trap. They see the $+$ sign and do $5+4=9$ first. Then they do $3-9 = -6$, but since they often lose the sign or rush, they'll multiply $2 \times -6$ to get **-12 (C)**. D is the result of adding first, then subtracting, then multiplying while ignoring the negative nature of the 5.

**basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%**
This is the danger zone. Most of these students (like *Tyler*) remember "BODMAS" but take it literally: A (Addition) comes before S (Subtraction). They will calculate $4 \times 2 = 8$, then do $5 + 8 = 13$, then $3 - 13 = -10$ (**D**). Or, they will correctly do the multiplication first ($8$), but then process the string $3-5+8$ as $3 - (5+8) = -10$ because they think addition *must* happen before subtraction. Those who get it right (**A**) are the ones who treat addition and subtraction with equal priority from left to right.

**proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%**
These students (like *Amira*) are confident with $4 \times 2 = 8$. The only reason they get it wrong is "The Trap." They know they should go left-to-right for addition and subtraction, but the "A" before "S" in the acronym is a strong psychological pull. About 20% of this group will still fall for the $3 - (5+8)$ calculation or lose a negative sign during the $3-5$ step.

**advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%**
Students like *Jack* and *Priya* won't even blink. They see the expression as terms: $3$, $-5$, and $+8$. They won't fall for the acronym trap because they understand that subtraction is just the addition of a negative number. They'll likely do $8+3-5$ or $8-2$ in their heads instantly.
