Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9s.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**

*   **Option B (The Correct Answer):** My proficient and advanced students will navigate the "double negative" for the final term without issue.
*   **Option D (The Main Pitfall):** This will be the most common error. Students like **Jack** and **Leo** often remember the rule "negative times a negative equals a positive" for the middle term addition ($ -5 + -7 = -12 $), but then their brains "run out of steam" by the fourth multiplication. They see two minus signs in the bracket and instinctively put a minus sign at the end of their expression, forgetting they are multiplying $-5 \times -7$.
*   **Option A (The "Difference" Error):** Students like **Chloe** will focus on the numerical difference between 5 and 7. They’ll do $7-5$ to get $2$ for the middle term, ignoring the actual algebraic process because they are rushing and looking for numbers they recognize.
*   **Option C (The Sign Swapper):** A few students who struggle with directed numbers, like **Mason**, will correctly calculate 12 and 35 but assume that because there are two minuses in the question, they "cancel out" to make everything positive.
