Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30 students.

**Teacher's Commentary:**
The presence of the **0** is the primary "distractor." Students often view 0 as "nothing," leading them to believe it shouldn't be counted in the divisor (Option C). Furthermore, the lack of brackets in Option B is a classic BIDMAS trap that trips up even mid-attaining students who are thinking about the calculator entry rather than the formal fraction. 

*   **A will be the most common correct answer.** 
*   **C** will be chosen by students who think 0 "doesn't count."
*   **B** will be chosen by those who mentally rehearse the calculator keystrokes without considering order of operations.
