Here is the predicted breakdown for my Year 9s. Even the bright ones can trip up on indices when a negative sign is involved.

**The Logic of the Wrong Answers:**
*   **Students picking B/D:** These are the "multiplier" thinkers. They see $3$ and $4$ and instinctively do $3 \times 4$. If they chose D, they remembered the negative but ignored the power rules.
*   **Students picking C:** This is the most common error. These students know $3^4 = 81$, but they assume a negative input must yield a negative output, or they are subconsciously thinking of how a non-scientific calculator treats $-3^4$ without brackets.
*   **Students picking A:** They correctly identify that a negative number raised to an even power results in a positive product.
