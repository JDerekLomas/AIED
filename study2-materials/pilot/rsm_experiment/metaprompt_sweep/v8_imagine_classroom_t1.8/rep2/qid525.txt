To give you my prediction for this Year 9 class, I need to look at the "hidden" hurdles in this question. 

For many, the trap isn't the addition—it's the format. Even my bright kids often forget to read the instruction "leave your answer as a mixed number." My "Basic" group (who struggle with confidence) will almost certainly add the numerators and denominators across because it feels "safe." Meanwhile, my "Below Basic" group will likely hit a wall with the common denominator and just pick something that looks like it has the right numbers in it.

Here is how I expect the 30 students to divide:

**The Breakdown:**

*   **The "D" Trap (D=4 8/14):** This is for my students who are rushing. They see 7+1 and 10+4. It looks logical, and they feel a sense of relief when they see it as an option.
*   **The "A" Hurdle (A=99/20):** This will catch my "Proficient" students. They know exactly how to do the math, they convert to improper fractions, find the common denominator of 20, get 54/20 + 45/20 = 99/20... and then stop. They forget the question asked for a mixed number.
*   **The "C" Confusion (C=99/40):** This is the "lost at sea" answer. They know they need to multiply something, so they multiply the denominators (10x4) but don't adjust the numerators correctly.

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=30% D=50%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=40% B=50% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=10% B=90% C=0% D=0%
