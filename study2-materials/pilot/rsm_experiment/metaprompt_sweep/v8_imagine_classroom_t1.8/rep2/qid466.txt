Based on my experience with this Year 9 group, they are going to struggle far more with the "minus times a minus" logic than the actual fraction arithmetic. Even my middle-ability kids tend to panic when they see three different minus signs in a single linear equation.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The "Double Negative" Trap:** A significant number of students (the 'basic' and 'proficient' groups) will correctly identify that the digits need to be flipped ($4/3$), but they will see the negative in the question and the negative in the answer and think: *"I need a positive to keep things simple"* or *"A negative is already there, I don't need another one."* They forget that a negative times a positive stays negative.
*   **The "Visual Matcher":** My below-basic students will often pick C or D because they just want the numbers to look like the ones already on the screen, or they think "the opposite of a negative is a positive" and pick C without calculating.

Here is my predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=50% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=45% B=50% C=5% D=0%
advanced: A=5% B=95% C=0% D=0%
