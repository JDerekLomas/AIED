Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9 class. 

The main hurdle here isn't the substitution, but the "decimal danger zone." My middle-to-lower sets often forget that squaring a decimal smaller than 1 makes it smaller, while my higher achievers sometimes rush and apply the coefficient (3) before the exponent.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **Students choosing B (0.27):** This will be the most common error. These students (like Liam and Chloe) will do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then attempt to "square" it, or more likely, they will calculate $0.3^2 = 0.09$ and then correctly multiply by 3, but their mental decimal placement will slip.
*   **Students choosing C (1.8):** These students (like Jack) see the "2" and multiply everything by it. They do $0.3 \times 3 \times 2 = 1.8$. It’s the classic "power means multiply by 2" misconception.
*   **Students choosing A (0.81):** This is the "BODMAS" breaker. They will do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ first, then square the result $(0.9^2)$.
