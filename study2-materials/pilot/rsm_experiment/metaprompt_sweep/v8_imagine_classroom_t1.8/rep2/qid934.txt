Here is the predicted distribution for a typical mixed-ability Year 9 class.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The 'C' Trap (Most Common):** Students see $x=0$ and jump straight to the answer $5$ (Option C). Half of them do this because they correctly calculate $2y=10$, but the other half simply look at the $y$-intercept logic ($y = mx + c$) and assume the first box is always the "constant" from the end of the equation.
*   **The 'A' Distractor:** These are my "number grabbers." They see the $4$, the $2$, the $10$, and the $0$. They mistakenly think they need to multiply $4 \times 5$ or do something involving $2 \times 10$ because "0 makes things disappear."
*   **The 'D' Distractor:** This catches the students who confuse the roles of $x$ and $y$. They divide $10$ by $4$ (the coefficient of $x$) instead of dividing by $2$.

**The Result Prediction:**

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=30% C=55% D=10%
proficient: A=0% B=75% C=20% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=5% D=0%
