Here is the predicted distribution and analysis for my Year 9 class of 30.

**The "Below Basic" group (approx. 5 students):**
These students (like Tyler and Lexi) struggle with the concept of a formula with no numbers. They see the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ in the original volume formula and immediately look for $\frac{4}{3}$ in the answer. They don't realise the $3$ moves to the top and the $4$ moves to the bottom when rearranging. They pick A because it "looks" the most like the original sphere formula.

**The "Basic" group (approx. 10 students):**
These students (like Chloe and Sam) know they need to rearrange $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$. They understand they need a cube root. However, their algebraic manipulation is "sticky." They often forget that $\pi$ is in the numerator ($4\pi/3$). When they try to move the $\pi$, they get confused about whether it stays with the $4$ or the $3$, leading many to choose B.

**The "Proficient" group (approx. 10 students):**
These are my solid Grade 5/6 sleepers. They know the formula and can move the $3$ up and the $4\pi$ down. Most will land on C. A few will pick D because they rush and think the cube root only applies to the $V$, not the entire fraction, or they get the reciprocal of the fraction mixed up during the "change side, change sign" process.

**The "Advanced" group (approx. 5 students):**
My high-flyers (like Leo and Maya). They can do this in their heads. They will instantly identify C.
