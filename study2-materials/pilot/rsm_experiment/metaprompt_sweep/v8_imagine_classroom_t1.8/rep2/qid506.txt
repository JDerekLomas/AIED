To give you my honest prediction for my Year 9s: many of them are going to fall into a classic trap here. To the "below basic" students, the $3$ and the $12$ are just screaming to be turned into a $4$, and because it's a fraction problem, they'll stick it in a fraction. My "proficient" kids often over-correct; they know they need to divide, but they'll accidentally multiply the numerator instead of the denominator because they're working too quickly.

Here is how I expect the 30 students to split:

below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=25% D=5%
**Rationale:** These students (like Tyler or Kyra) see "3" and "12" and immediately think "4". Option A feels "right" because it's a fraction, and Option C is their backup because they prefer whole numbers. They aren't thinking about inverse operations; they are looking for a relationship between the digits.

basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
**Rationale:** This group (like Leo) knows they need to divide by 3. However, they will struggle with $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$. A large chunk will get confused and think "what's a third of 12?" which leads them back to 4 (Option A). Those who remember "Keep-Change-Flip" will get to B, but many will make a mental arithmetic error and land on D.

proficient: A=10% B=80% C=0% D=10%
**Rationale:** Most of these students (like Sarah) will nail it. They understand that $3p = \frac{1}{12}$ means $p = \frac{1}{12 \times 3}$. The ones who miss it will likely do $12 \div 3$ out of habit, even though they know the rule, simply because $\frac{1}{4}$ looks like a more "standard" answer than $\frac{1}{36}$.

advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
**Rationale:** My top-set flyers (like James or Amina) will see this as a one-step operation. They might double-check it because $\frac{1}{36}$ feels like a small, "ugly" number, but they will trust their algebraic manipulation.

below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=25% D=5%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=0% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
