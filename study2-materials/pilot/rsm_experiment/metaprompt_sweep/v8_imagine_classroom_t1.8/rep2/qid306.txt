Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30 students.

In my experience, the "trap" in Problem P is far more lethal than the one in Problem Q. Many students have "BIDMAS" drilled into their heads alphabetically; they see **A** (Addition) comes before **S** (Subtraction) in the acronym and mistakenly believe they *must* add 5 and 6 before touching the 4. This is a classic case of over-correcting for a rule they don’t fully understand.

**below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%**
These students (about 6-7 in the class) are guessing or following the "left-to-right" instinct for everything until they remember BIDMAS exists, at which point they panic and pick **D** because it feels more "mathematical." Those picking **A** just calculate left-to-right without thinking about rules at all.

**basic: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%**
This group (about 8-10 students) is the most likely to get it wrong. They know BIDMAS, but they follow it literally. They will look at Problem P and say, "Addition comes first," leading them straight to $5+6$. They'll get Problem Q right because they know "Multiply before Add," making **D** their confident, but incorrect, choice.

**proficient: A=10% B=60% C=0% D=30%**
These students (about 8 students) are starting to realise that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority. However, under the pressure of a quick quiz, a few will still fall back into the "A before S" trap of the literal acronym. Most will correctly identify **B**.

**advanced: A=5% B=95% C=0% D=0%**
The top set (4-5 students) will see the trap immediately. They understand the "left-to-right" rule for operations of equal priority. The only ones getting it wrong are those who overthink it or misread the question as asking for the *value* rather than the *step*.
