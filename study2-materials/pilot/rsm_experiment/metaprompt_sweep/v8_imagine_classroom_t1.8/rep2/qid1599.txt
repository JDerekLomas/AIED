**Teacher’s Notes and Predictions:**

*   **The "BIDMAS" Trap (Option C):** My middle-to-lower ability students (the 'basic' group) often have a surface-level memory of order of operations. They see the division sign and the brackets, but their brains try to "simplify" the visual by removing the brackets first. They will select C because they think the fraction line replaces the division sign only for the letters, leaving the "+4" to trail off at the end. 
*   **The "Upside-Down" Confusion (Option D):** Several students who actually understand that division equals a fraction will still get this wrong. There is a persistent misconception that the "bigger" expression or the "group" should be the foundation (the denominator), or they simply haven't solidified that the first term is the numerator. I expect my 'proficient' kids to make this silly error if they are rushing.
*   **The "Ghost Numbers" (Option B):** This is for my students who panic when they see letters. They feel the 'c' looks lonely and try to "balance" the fraction by adding the 4 to the top as well. It’s a total guess based on a half-remembered rule about equivalent fractions.
*   **The 'Advanced' Group:** For my top set students, this is a "3-second question." They will likely be annoyed that I’m even asking it, but it's a good diagnostic to catch any lurking denominator/numerator confusion before we move onto algebraic fractions.
