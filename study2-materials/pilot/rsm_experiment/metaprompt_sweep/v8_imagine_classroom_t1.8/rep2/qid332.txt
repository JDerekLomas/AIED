To predict this, I have to think about "Order of Operations" versus "Balance Methods." Year 9s often treat algebraic rules as a set of rigid, chronological steps rather than equivalent balances.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The Tom Trappers (A):** These are my "BIDMAS" robots. They have been taught that you *must* deal with the addition/subtraction before the multiplication/division. To them, Katie's move isn't just different; it feels "illegal."
*   **The Katie Supporters (B):** These students often struggle with fractions. They see the $3$ and want it gone immediately. However, their fatal flaw is forgetting that the $3$ must divide *everything* on the left. They’ll see $x-5=36$ as perfectly logical because they "multiplied by 3" but forgot to distribute it to the $-5$.
*   **The Proficient Split (C vs A):** My strongest students will see that while Katie *could* be right if she multiplied everything, her specific line $x-5=36$ is wrong because the $5$ didn't become $15$. Therefore, they will settle on A.
*   **The Guessers (D):** Usually, students who are overwhelmed by the fraction $x/3$ and assume there's a trick they don't understand.

**The Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** Will mostly pick **B**. They see "multiply by 3" as a magic wand that removes the denominator and moves the 3 to the 12, ignoring the 5 entirely.
*   **Basic:** Will be split between **A** and **B**. They know "inverse operations" but are inconsistent in applying them to all terms.
*   **Proficient:** High concentration on **A**. They are confident in the "standard" way (adding 5 first) and will correctly identify that Katie’s math $(x-5=36)$ is a failed attempt at clearing the fraction.
*   **Advanced:** Most will get **A** correctly. A few might overthink it and wonder if "correct next line" allows for skipped steps, but they will ultimately spot Katie's distribution error.

below_basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=40% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=10% D=0%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
