Here is the predicted distribution for a typical mixed-ability Year 9 class.

below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=60% D=0%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%

**The Rationale & Student Profiles:**

*   **The "Exclude Zero" Trap (Choice C):** This is the biggest pitfall for my **Below Basic** and lower **Basic** students (e.g., *Tyler* and *Chloe*). They have a deep-seated mental rule that "zero means nothing." When they see "Divide by $n$," their brains automatically count the "real" numbers. They think they are being clever by not letting the 0 "ruin" the average.
*   **The Calculator Logic Trap (Choice B):** This will snag the students who rely heavily on their phones or basic scientific calculators without thinking about BODMAS/BIDMAS (e.g., *Jayden*). They read the expression left-to-right. In their heads, they are performing the sum first, but they won't notice that mathematically, Option B only divides the 7 by 5. 
*   **The "0 is a placeholder" Insight (Choice A):** Most **Proficient** students (e.g., *Amara*) will correctly identify that while 0 doesn't add value to the numerator, it is a crucial data point for the denominator. They see $1+3+4+7$ as a simplified version of $0+1+3+4+7$.
*   **The "It’s a Trick" Overthinkers (Choice D):** My **Advanced** students (e.g., *Leo*) and some skeptical **Proficient** kids will hover over D. They will argue that Option A is "technically" incomplete because the 0 isn't written in the numerator. They’ll stall, wondering if I'm testing them on the formal definition of the sum of *all* elements. Usually, the Advanced kids will settle on A as the "best" fit, but a few will choose D just to prove a point during the feedback session.
