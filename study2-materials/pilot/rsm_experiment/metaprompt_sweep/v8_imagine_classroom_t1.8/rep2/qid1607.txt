As a Year 9 teacher, I know exactly what’s going to happen here. This is a classic "sign error" trap masked by a "checking" exercise.

**The Predicted Breakdown:**

The "Advanced" kids will breeze through, see that Step 2 requires subtracting 1, and confidently pick A. My "Basic/Proficient" middle-ground students are the biggest risk; they understand that $15 \times 4 = 60$, so they feel Step 1 is "safe." Once they see 60 and 1, their brains go on autopilot. They see the $+1$ and their eyes just do "60 plus 1 is 61," completely ignoring the inverse operation required to move across the equals sign. They'll pick C because Step 1 "looks right" and the arithmetic in Step 2 ($60+1=61$) is "true," even if the algebraic logic isn't.

The "Below Basic" group will likely pick D. Why? Because they often think "The question is asking me to find a mistake, therefore there *must* be mistakes." They see a fraction and immediately assume the first step of multiplying must be wrong because they personally hate dividing.

**The Predicted Distribution:**

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=30% D=50%
basic: A=25% B=5% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
