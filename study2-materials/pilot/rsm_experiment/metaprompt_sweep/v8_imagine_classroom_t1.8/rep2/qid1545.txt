Here is the predicted breakdown for a typical Year 9 class in the UK, based on common misconceptions surrounding BIDMAS (Order of Operations) and the visual "distractor" of the identical numbers.

**The Classroom Instinct:**
Most students will be lured by the fact that both sides contain an 8, a 12, and a 4. The "Working Memory" trap here is the left side: students often read it left-to-right, doing $8+12=20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$. Because the right side *also* simplifies to $20 \div 4 = 5$ (due to the brackets forcing the addition), many students will confidently select 'Equal'. 

**The Error Profiles:**
*   **The "Left-to-Right" Group:** These students ignore BIDMAS hierarchy. They see $8+12 \div 4$ and do the addition first because it appears first. They find $5=5$ and choose **C**.
*   **The "Visual Pattern" Group:** They won't even calculate. They see the same digits and signs and assume the brackets are just "fluff" or don't change the outcome of those specific numbers. They choose **C**.
*   **The Proficient/Advanced:** They spot the division must happen first on the left ($8+3=11$). They compare $11$ to $5$ and correctly choose **A**.
