To give you an honest prediction for a typical Year 9 class, we have to look at the psychological "potholes" in this specific equation. 

The main hurdle isn't the algebra; it's the decimal and the negative sign. When students see $y=0.5$, a large group will instinctively "half" something because $0.5$ is a half. When they see $-6y$, they often lose the negative during the transposition or add $3$ to $30$ instead of dealing with the fact that $6 \times 0.5$ is $3$.

Here is my predicted distribution based on how they'll "see" the math:

*   **Choice C (3.3):** This is the "autopilot" error. They do $10x = 30 + 3$ but then treat the $.3$ as the decimal because they see $x=33/10$.
*   **Choice D (2.7):** The most common mistake. They subtract the $3$ from $30$ (treating the $-6y$ as if it were already on the other side or failing to handle the inverse operation correctly).
*   **Choice A (4.25) & B (-4.25):** These are the "I'm lost" guesses, where they try to divide 30 or 17 by something entirely unrelated, or they accidentally use the 4 from the 4.25 because they swapped $x$ and $y$.

**The "Why" behind the students:**
*   **The "Lower" group** will pick D because "subtraction" feels right when you're moving things across an equals sign, and 2.7 looks like a "maths teacher answer."
*   **The "Proficient" group** usually gets to $10x - 3 = 30$ but then hits a 50/50 chance of correctly adding the 3. Half will fall for the "3.3" trap because dividing by 10 feels like just adding a decimal point.
*   **The "Advanced" group** will mentally substitute $y$, get $10x - 3 = 30$, move to $33$, and select 3.3. Wait—some of my very best will actually pause, realize $33 \div 10$ is exactly 3.3, and be the only ones to cruise to the answer without hesitation.
