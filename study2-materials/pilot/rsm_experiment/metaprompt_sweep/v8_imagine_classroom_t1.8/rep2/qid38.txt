To predict the outcome for my Year 9s, I have to look at the classic "traps." For the weaker students, fractions are still a source of "add everything" panic. For the middle-attainers, the $2x$ vs $x$ denominator is a prime candidate for a "multiplication forgetfulness" error.

Here is how I expect the 30 students to split across the levels:

**The Thinking Behind the Mistakes:**
*   **The "Adders" (Option B):** These students (likely my Below Basic group) see the plus sign and simply add the numerators ($3+4$) and the denominators ($2x+x$). In their minds, they are being logical and efficient. They find fractions stressful and just want to "merge" the numbers.
*   **The "Over-compensators" (Option D):** These students (Basic) recognize they need a common denominator of $2x$, but they only change the denominator and forget to scale the numerator. They’ll change $4/x$ to $4/2x$ and get $7/2x$. They think they've done the "clever" part by matching the $x$ terms.
*   **The "Double Counters" (Option C):** A few might multiply both sides unnecessarily or lose the $2$ entirely.
*   **The "Proficient/Advanced":** These students will instinctively double the 4 to 8, then add the 3 to get 11 over the common denominator $2x$.

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
