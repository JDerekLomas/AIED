Here is the predicted distribution for a typical mixed-ability Year 9 class. 

**The Rationale:**
*   **The Trap (Option D):** This is the biggest hurdle for my "Basic" and "Below Basic" students. There is a deep-seated instinct to add everything they see. They will add the whole numbers ($2+1=3$), add the numerators ($1+2=3$), and then—almost reflexively—add the denominators ($5+5=10$). In their minds, they are being thorough.
*   **The Format Fail (Option B):** My "Proficient" students often default to "proper mathematician mode" and convert everything to improper fractions. They’ll get $11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$. Because it’s a mathematically correct value, they’ll tick B immediately, completely ignoring the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number." 
*   **The Confusion (Option C):** These students are overwhelmed. They’ve mixed up the rules for multiplication and addition. They added the numerators but then decided to add the denominators because they know "something has to change" when you calculate.

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=10% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=70% B=20% C=0% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
