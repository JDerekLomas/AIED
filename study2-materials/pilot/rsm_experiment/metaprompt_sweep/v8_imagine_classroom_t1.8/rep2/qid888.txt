Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9 class of 30, based on their typical progress with quadratic expansion at this stage in the term.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**

*   **Option B (The Correct Answer):** Most of the class is solid on FOIL or the Grid Method. They know "negative times a negative is a positive."
*   **Option D (The Most Likely Trap):** This is where my "rushed" students land. Students like *Leo* or *Chloe* will correctly calculate -5 + -7 = -12 for the middle term, but then their brain shifts gears. They see the two minus signs in the original bracket and reflexively put a minus sign at the end, forgetting that $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$.
*   **Option A (The Difference Error):** I expect one or two students, like *Jack*, who still get "adding directed numbers" confused. They'll look at 5 and 7 and find the difference (2) instead of the sum (12), often because they are visualising a number line incorrectly.
*   **Option C (The "Ignore the Sign" Error):** This is for my students who are still overwhelmed by algebra. They just see 5 and 7, add them to get 12, multiply to get 35, and keep everything positive because it's "easier."
