Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 class of 30, based on my experience of common misconceptions with directed numbers and expanding brackets.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The Adders (C and D):** Students like **Archie** and **Chloe** will see the numbers 1 and 4 and immediately add them. Even though the question says "multiplies," their brains are on "auto-pilot" mode for combining terms. Archie will choose -5 because "a negative and a negative stay negative." 
*   **The Sign Slippers (B):** This is where **Leo** and **Mia** fall. They know it's multiplication (1 × 4 = 4), but they haven't internalised the "two negatives make a positive" rule yet, or they simply see the minus sign on the 4 and assume the final answer must be negative.
*   **The Confident Corrects (A):** The advanced students like **Sita** and **James** will spot the trap immediately. They’ve been bitten by negative signs before and will take the extra half-second to tick off "negative times negative equals positive."
