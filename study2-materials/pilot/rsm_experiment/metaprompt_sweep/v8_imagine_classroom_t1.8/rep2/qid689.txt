Based on my experience with Year 9, many students struggle when the unknown is in the denominator. They instinctively try to perform a calculation with the two numbers they see ($10$ and $5$) rather than performing inverse operations. Students in the "below basic" group will almost certainly default to multiplication because they assume the variable must be the largest number, while those in the middle will simply divide in the "easy" direction ($10 \div 5$).

The specific pitfall here is the "inverse division" trap; students see $10$ and $5$ and their brain skips to $10 \div 5 = 2$, ignoring the fact that the $5$ is the numerator.

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=30% D=0%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=65% D=0%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=15% D=0%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
