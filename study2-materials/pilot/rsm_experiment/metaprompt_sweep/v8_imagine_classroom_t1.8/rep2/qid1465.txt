Here is the predicted distribution and the reasoning behind the mistakes for my Year 9s.

**The "Why":**
*   **The Left-to-Right Trap (Answer B):** This is the biggest hurdle. Despite years of BIDMAS, many students still read maths like a sentence. They will do $3-5 = -2$, then $-2+4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$. They feel confident because the arithmetic is simple.
*   **The Addition before Subtraction Trap (Answer D):** Students who remember BIDMAS rigidly often think "A" comes before "S". They will do $4 \times 2 = 8$, then they see $-5+8$ as $-(5+8)$. They’ll calculate $3 - 13 = -10$.
*   **The Bracket Hallucination (Answer C):** A few will see the minus sign and decide to "group" the end, doing $(5+4) \times 2 = 18$, then $3-18 = -15$, but they'll settle for -12 because they messed up the subtraction or misread the numbers.
*   **The Successes (Answer A):** $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 + 8$. The key here isn't just knowing to multiply first; it's being able to handle the directed number calculation $-2 + 8$ or $3 + 3$.
