Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30 students.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
Even though this is Year 9, the acronym **BIDMAS/BODMAS** remains a double-edged sword. 

The biggest "trap" for your mid-attaining (Basic/Proficient) students isn't Problem Q (multiplication over addition)—they've had that drilled into them since Year 7. The trap is **Problem P**. Because "A" (Addition) comes before "S" (Subtraction) in the acronym, a significant number of students believe they *must* calculate $5+6$ first, leading them to choose **D**. They treat BIDMAS as a rigid hierarchy rather than recognizing that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right. 

Conversely, your "Below Basic" students often default to "Reading Order" for everything, which makes them get P right by accident but fail Q, leading them to **A**.

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=5% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=0% D=30%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
