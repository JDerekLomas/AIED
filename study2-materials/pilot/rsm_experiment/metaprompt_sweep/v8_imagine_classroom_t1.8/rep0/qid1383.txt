Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30 students.

**Teacher's Reflection:**
The biggest hurdle here isn't the arithmetic; it’s the "sign rules." 
*   The **Below Basic** group will likely forget what indices even mean, treating it as a multiplication problem ($3 \times 4$). 
*   The **Basic** group will know it means $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$, but they struggle with negative numbers. In their minds, "a negative squared is a positive, but three or four negatives? That must go back to being negative." 
*   The **Proficient** group will reach $81$, but many will hesitate and add a negative sign because the question started with one—they lack the confidence to trust that the power of 4 cancels the minus. 
*   The **Advanced** students will instinctively know that even exponents yield positive results.

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=0% C=35% D=0%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
