To give you the predicted breakdown for my Year 9s, I have to look at the "illusion of simplicity" here. While this is a one-step equation, the fraction on the right-hand side creates a massive cognitive load for students who haven't fully internalised inverse operations with rational numbers.

Here is how I expect my 30 students to perform:

**The Thinking Behind the Mistakes:**
*   **The Choice A Trap (The "Number Bond" Instinct):** Many students in the lower and middle sets (below_basic and basic) will see '3' and '12' and immediately think '4'. They won't think about whether they are multiplying or dividing; they just see a relationship between the digits. They see $\frac{1}{12}$, they see 3, and their brain jumps to $\frac{1}{4}$ because 12 divided by 3 is 4.
*   **The Choice C Trap (The Reciprocal Error):** Some students will correctly identify they need to "get rid of the fraction" but will do so by multiplying the 3 by 12 rather than dividing the fraction by 3. They effectively flip the operation because they find $1/12$ intimidating to work with.
*   **Choice B (The Correct Logic):** Only the students who can confidently articulate that $p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3$, which is the same as $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$, will land here.

below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
