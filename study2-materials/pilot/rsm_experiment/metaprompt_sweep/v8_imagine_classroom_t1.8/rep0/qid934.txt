Here is the predicted distribution based on typical Year 9 classroom misconceptions.

The primary hurdle here is that the equation is not in the "easy" $y = mx + c$ format. While $x=0$ is the easiest substitution, many students fail to perform the algebraic rearrangement correctly, while others suffer from "pattern seeking" (looking at the numbers 4, 2, and 10 and performing an operation that feels "right").

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **A (20):** These students are "calculating" without understanding. They see $x=0$, $4$ and $5$. They multiply $4 \times 5$ because they want the numbers to relate to the $10$ in some way, or they think the $x$ and $y$ swap.
*   **B (3):** This is a very common "middle-set" mistake. They substitute $x=1$ (the next column) or they mentally calculate $4 + 2 = 6$, $10 - 6 = 4$, etc. It’s a "process noise" error.
*   **C (5): Correct.** $4(0) + 2y = 10 \Rightarrow 2y = 10 \Rightarrow y = 5$.
*   **D (2.5):** These students divide $10$ by $4$ because they see the $4$ first and remember that $x=0$ usually "eliminates something," but they eliminate the $y$ term instead of the $x$ term.
