To set the scene for my Year 9s: we’ve done the volume of a sphere formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ last week, but many are still reliant on their "formula stickers" in their books. Rearranging formulas with fractions and powers is the "final boss" of the term.

**The Mistakes & Personalities:**
*   **The "Top Heavy" Guessers (Option A):** This will be my most common error. Students like *Leo* and *Sienna* see the $4$, the $\pi$, and the $3$ and just want to multiply everything together because they struggle with the concept of an inverse operation when it looks like a fraction. They see the $3$ on the bottom and assume they should bring it "up" to join the others.
*   **The "Lost the $\pi$" group (Option B):** *Jack* will get halfway there. He’ll correctly move the $3$ to the top ($3V$) but then forget that $\pi$ is a number attached to the $4$. He’ll divide by 3 and multiply by 4 because he's rushing.
*   **The "Linear thinkers" (Option D):** These are my students who are terrified of the cube root symbol. They see a cube root on the $V$ but want the numbers outside of it because they don't believe a fraction can "live" inside a root.
