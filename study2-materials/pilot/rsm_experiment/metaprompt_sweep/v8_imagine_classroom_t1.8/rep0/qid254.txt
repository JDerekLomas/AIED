Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30 students.

**The Context:**
*   **The Zero Trap:** This is the primary hurdle. Many students view zero as "nothing" rather than a data point. 
*   **The Calculator/BODMAS Trap:** Option B is a classic "linear input" error that students make on scientific calculators. 
*   **The Fraction vs. Value Trap:** Option A is technically the correct calculation, but students often hesitate because the zero isn't physically written in the numerator, even though adding zero doesn't change the sum.

**The Distribution:**

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%

**The Analysis of Errors:**

*   **The "Zero isn't a number" group (Basic/Below Basic):** These students will flock to **C**. Their internal logic is: "Zero is nothing, so there are only four numbers to divide by." They will see the 4 in the denominator and feel it is the most logical "fit" for the visible non-zero digits.
*   **The "Scientific Calculator" group (Below Basic):** These students will pick **B**. They are used to typing strings into their Casios exactly as they see them. They don't realise that without brackets, the calculator will only divide the 7 by 5 ($0+1+3+4+(7 \div 5)$). They identify the operation symbols and the numbers and assume it's correct.
*   **The "Visual Match" group (Basic/Proficient):** Many will pick **A**. While the 0 is missing from the numerator, these students recognise that adding 0 is identity, and the divisor is 5, which counts all the items. They see it as the "best" representation.
*   **The "Pedantic/Overthinkers" (Advanced):** A small handful of high-flyers will pick **D**. They will argue that A is technically an *incomplete* representation of the process even if the result is the same. They will look for a fraction with $0+1+3+4+7$ on top, and not finding it, they'll choose "None" because the zero is "missing" from the sum.
