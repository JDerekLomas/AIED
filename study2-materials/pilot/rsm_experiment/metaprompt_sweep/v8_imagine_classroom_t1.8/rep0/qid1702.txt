To predict the performance of my Year 9s, I have to account for "decimal dread" and the classic mistake of mixing up the $x$ and $y$ variables. Even though the question provides $y = 0.5$, a significant number of students will substitute $0.5$ for $x$ because it's the first variable they see.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The Option C Trap (The 'X substitution' error):** Students in the below_basic and basic tiers often assume the first row of a table is what you plug into the equation. They will calculate $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$, leading to $5 - 6y = 30$, then $-6y = 25$, getting roughly $y = -4.16$, but because $3.3$ "looks like" a third of 10, they'll guess C. Alternatively, they just see 30, 10, and 6 and try to divide 10 by 3.
*   **The Option D Trap (Calculation error):** Students substitute correctly: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, which becomes $10x - 3 = 30$. However, they fail the inverse operation, subtracting 3 from 30 to get 27, then dividing by 10 to get 2.7. 
*   **The Option B Trap (Sign error):** They reach $10x - 3 = 30$, correctly add 3 to get 33, but then get confused by the subtraction sign in the original equation and decide the answer must be negative.

**Predicted Distribution:**

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
