Here is my prediction for the Year 9 cohort after teaching this topic for two weeks. Even though the question is relatively standard, the signs are always the undoing of middle-ability students.

**Predicted Student Reasoning:**

*   **Option B (Correct):** My **advanced** students and some **proficient** ones will apply FOIL/Grid method systematically and remember that $-5 \times -7 = +35$.
*   **Option D (The Main Pitfall):** This will be the most common error. Students like **Jake and Chloe** will correctly sum $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12m$, but their brains will switch off for the final term. They see two minus signs and their instinct says "the answer involves a minus," resulting in $-35$. 
*   **Option A (The Difference Error):** Students like **Leo** who struggle with directed numbers will "find the difference" between 7 and 5 instead of adding them, leading to $-2m$. They often confuse the rules for adding/subtracting with the rules for multiplying.
*   **Option C (The Sign Flip):** A few students who over-rely on the "two negatives make a positive" rule will apply it indiscriminately to both the middle term and the end term.
