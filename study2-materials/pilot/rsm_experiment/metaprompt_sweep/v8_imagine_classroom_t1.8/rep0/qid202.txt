Here is the predicted distribution for a typical mixed-ability Year 9 class. 

**The Rationale:**
The "Below Basic" group will almost certainly succumb to the "add everything" trap, summing the denominators to get 10. The "Basic" group will likely calculate the correct value but fail to follow the specific instruction to provide a mixed number, or they will convert to improper fractions and get stuck. The "Advanced" group will find this trivial, but 1 or 2 may still rush and tick the improper fraction (B) by accident.

**Student Thought Processes:**
*   **The "Adders" (Choice D):** Students like **Tyler** or **Kayla** will see the numbers and instinctively think, "2+1=3, 1+2=3, 5+5=10." It feels symmetrical and "complete" to them to change every number in the expression.
*   **The "Format-Blind" (Choice B):** Someone like **Leo** will immediately convert both to $\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5}$, get $\frac{18}{5}$, see it as an option, and click it instantly. He knows how to do the math but doesn't read the final sentence of the prompt.
*   **The "Confused Overthinkers" (Choice C):** A few students who remember a "rule" about denominators but can't quite place it might try to multiply them or add them while ignoring the whole numbers entirely, resulting in a nonsensical fraction.

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=10% D=50%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=0% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
