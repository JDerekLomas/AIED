To a Year 9 class, this is a classic "trapping" question. At first glance, Step 1 looks right because they know $15 \times 4 = 60$. Step 2 looks right because $60 + 1 = 61$. The mistake in Step 2 is the inverse operation, but many students "autopilot" when they see a 60 and a 1, assuming addition.

Here is how I predict my 30 students will split, based on their typical classroom habits:

**Below Basic (approx. 5 students):** These students struggle with the fraction bar and basic operations. They might guess D because they lack confidence, or C because "60 and 1 makes 61" feels instinctively right without checking the sign.
**Basic (approx. 10 students):** This is the bulk of the class. They will correctly see Step 1 as multiplication ($15 \times 4 = 60$). However, when they get to Step 2, they see $+1$ and their brain triggers "add one" instead of "subtract one." They will confidently choose C, convinced they’ve verified the logic.
**Proficient (approx. 10 students):** These students are wary of traps. They will identify that $k$ should be 59. They will look at Step 2, see it says 61, and correctly identify that only Step 1 works.
**Advanced (approx. 5 students):** These students see the mistake instantly. They might spend a second overthinking if there’s a "trick" in Step 1 (like the fraction bar being shorter), but they will almost all land on A.

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=0% C=70% D=0%
proficient: A=80% B=0% C=20% D=0%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
