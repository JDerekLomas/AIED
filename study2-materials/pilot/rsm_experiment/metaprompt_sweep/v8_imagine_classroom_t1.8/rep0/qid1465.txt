Here is the predicted distribution and the pedagogical reasoning behind the mistakes for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The Left-to-Right Trap (Answer B):** This is the most common Year 9 error. Students see $3-5+4$ first and calculate as they read: $3-5 = -2$; then $-2 + 4 = 2$; then $2 \times 2 = 4$. They often forget that BODMAS/BIDMAS isn't just a list, but a hierarchy where multiplication takes priority over the subtraction at the start.
*   **The Sign Swap / Subtraction Error (Answer A):** Students who correctly do $4 \times 2 = 8$ first often struggle with the directed number part. They see $3-5+8$. A common mistake is to do $5+8 = 13$ (treating the 5 as positive) and then $3-13 = -10$, or they simply get muddled with the number line and end up at 6 by ignoring the negative sign correctly.
*   **The Bracket Confusion (Answers C & D):** The students picking these are often over-complicating it. They think there *must* be hidden brackets. $(3-5+4) \times 2$ leads to $4$, while $(3-(5+4)) \times 2$ leads to $-12$. These students are guessing based on "looking" for a harder operation.
