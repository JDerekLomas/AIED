Here is the predicted distribution for your Year 9 class, based on typical misconceptions regarding the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

**The Breakdown:**
*   **The LHS (Left Hand Side):** Many students will erroneously add 8+12 first to get 20, then divide by 4 to get **5**. Those who remember BIDMAS will get $8 + 3 = \mathbf{11}$.
*   **The RHS (Right Hand Side):** Most will correctly calculate the bracket first to get $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.
*   **The Trap:** Students who make the mistake on the LHS will see $5 \square 5$ and gravitate instantly to "=".

**The Prediction:**

below_basic: A=5% B=15% C=80% D=0%
*Context: These 6-7 students (the "bottom set" mindset) will work left-to-right on both sides. They see the numbers 8, 12, and 4 repeated and assume symmetry. They'll calculate $8+12=20, 20 \div 4 = 5$ for both sides and pick C. Some might pick B because the RHS has "protective" brackets, making it feel "bigger" intuitively.*

basic: A=20% B=10% C=70% D=0%
*Context: These 9-10 students know BIDMAS exists but apply it inconsistently. They will get the RHS right (5), but their eyes will deceive them on the LHS. They’ll read $8+12 \div 4$ and subconsciously group the addition because it's what they'd say aloud ("Eight plus twelve... divided by four"). The pull of $5=5$ is a very strong distractor for this group.*

proficient: A=75% B=5% C=20% D=0%
*Context: These 10 students are your reliable 'Grade 4/5' targets. Most will catch the division on the LHS ($12 \div 4 = 3$) and compare $11 > 5$. The 20% who get it wrong are the ones rushing; they'll spot the same numbers on both sides and "logic" their way to '=' without picking up a pen.*

advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
*Context: Your top 4 students. They will see the trap immediately. They might even chuckle that you gave them such an "easy" one, not realising that half the room is currently falling into the $5=5$ pitfall.*
