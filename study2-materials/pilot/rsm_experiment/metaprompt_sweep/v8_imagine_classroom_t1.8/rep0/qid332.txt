To predict this distribution, I have to consider the classic Year 9 pitfall: **BIDMAS in reverse** vs. **the "multiply everything" instinct**. 

Even my high achievers sometimes overthink Katie’s suggestion because they know they *can* multiply the whole equation by 3, but they forget that the $-5$ must also be multiplied. My middle-ability students (Basic/Proficient) often treat the fraction as a "house" that only contains the $x$ and the $3$, assuming the $-5$ is separate and therefore stays as it is when "moving" the 3.

**Who will get it wrong and why?**
*   **The "Rule Followers" (Basic):** They will pick **A**. They have been drilled to "move the added/subtracted number first." To them, Katie's move looks "illegal" because it ignores the priority they've been taught.
*   **The "Action-Oriented" (Proficient):** They will pick **C**. These students recognize that Katie is "multiplying by 3," which is a valid inverse of "divide by 3." However, they will fail to notice that Katie didn't multiply the $-5$ by 3. They see $x$, $36$, and the original $-5$ and think, "Yep, the math checks out."
*   **The "Advanced" Students:** Most will spot the mistake in Katie's term-to-term consistency, but 10-15% will rush, see Katie's $36$ ($12 \times 3$), and assume she's just a genius skipping a step, falling into the trap of Option C.

Here is the predicted distribution for my 30 students:

below_basic: A=50% B=10% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=5% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=45% B=5% C=45% D=5%
advanced: A=80% B=0% C=20% D=0%
