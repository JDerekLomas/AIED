Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9s.

Even though they have done expanding brackets recently, there is a recurring mental trap with the "FOIL" method where students stop thinking about multiplication and start thinking about the numerical gap between the numbers, or they simply "lose" the sign of the first term because it feels like a subtraction operator rather than a negative property.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The "Adders" (C and D):** Students like **Tyler and Chloe** will see $-1$ and $-4$ and their brains will default to addition. They see two negatives and think "make it a bigger negative" (yielding -5) or they remember the rule "two negatives make a positive" but apply it to addition (yielding +5).
*   **The "Sign Droppers" (B):** **Leo and Mia** often forget that the sign belongs to the term. They will see $1 \times 4 = 4$ and then just "bring down" the minus sign from the middle of the second bracket without considering the first -1.
*   **The "Proficient" (A):** The majority will correctly identify that the arrows represent the "Last" in FOIL and correctly multiply $-1 \times -4$.

basic: A=50% B=20% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
