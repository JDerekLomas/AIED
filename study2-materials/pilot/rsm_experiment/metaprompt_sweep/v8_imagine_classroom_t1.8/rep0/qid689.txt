To predict the outcome for my Year 9s, I have to look at the classic "bigger divided by smaller" trap. Many of my middle-set students see the numbers 10 and 5 and their brains immediately perform $10 \div 5$ because it's a "cleaner" calculation than $5 \div 10$.

Even my stronger students can trip up if they are rushing; they see the structure of a one-step equation and intuitively think "multiply to undo division," leading them to $10 \times 5 = 50$. Only the students who actually write down the step of multiplying by $p$ first will consistently find $0.5$.

Here is my predicted distribution based on my current class:

below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=60% D=0%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=40% D=0%
proficient: A=65% B=15% C=20% D=0%
advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%

**The reasoning behind the wrong answers:**
*   **The 'C' students (The Majority of Lower/Basic):** These students suffer from "commutative intuition." They see 10 and 5 and subconsciously assume the order doesn't matter. They calculate $10 \div 5 = 2$ because it results in a whole number, whereas $5 \div 10$ feels "wrong" or "impossible" to them in a quick-fire setting.
*   **The 'B' students:** These students have remembered half of the rule. They know that to "move" a number from the bottom of a fraction, you multiply. They do $10 \times 5$ and don't stop to think if the resulting $50 = 5/50$ makes any sense.
*   **The 'A' students:** These are the ones who either used a "formula triangle" method correctly or, more likely, performed the two-step algebraic process: $10p = 5$, therefore $p = 5/10$.
