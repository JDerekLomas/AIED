As a Year 9 teacher, I’m looking at this question and immediately seeing the "danger zones." While it looks like a standard fraction addition, the presence of the mixed number format in the prompt vs. the options is where the battle is won or lost.

Here is my prediction for the classroom of 30:

**Below Basic (approx. 5 students):**
These are my students who are still terrified of fractions. They see the numbers and just want to "do something" to make the problem go away. They will almost certainly go for **D**. Why? Because $2+2=4$, $7+1=8$, and $10+4=14$. It feels "logical" to them to just add straight across. It’s the path of least resistance.
**below_basic: A=0% B=10% C=10% D=80%**

**Basic (approx. 10 students):**
This group knows they need a common denominator, but they get "denominator fatigue." Some will calculate the correct common denominator (20) but forget to multiply the numerators, leading to an incorrect result. However, a significant portion will fall into the **A** trap. They’ve been drilled to convert to improper fractions ($27/10 + 9/4$) to solve, they get the correct total of $99/20$, and they stop there because they see the number on the screen. They’ll ignore the "Leave as a mixed number" instruction because they’re so relieved to see their calculation match an option.
**basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%**

**Proficient (approx. 10 students):**
These students have the routine down. They’ll likely add the integers ($2+2=4$) and then find the common denominator of 20 for the fractions ($14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20$). They are less likely to fall for D because they know "the rule" about denominators. A few might still get lured by A if they are over-thinkers who prefer improper fractions.
**proficient: A=10% B=85% C=0% D=5%**

**Advanced (approx. 5 students):**
These students will spot the "mixed number" requirement immediately. They won't even look at A or C because they aren't mixed numbers. They will mentally calculate $14/20 + 5/20$ in seconds.
**advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%**
