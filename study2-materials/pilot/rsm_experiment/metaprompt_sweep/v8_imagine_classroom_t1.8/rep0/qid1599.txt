To predict this, I’m thinking of my "Middle Set" Year 9s. We’ve covered algebraic fractions, but under the pressure of a quick "exit ticket" or diagnostic question, their eyes often skip over the structure of the expression. 

The **Below Basic** group (the "flighty" workers) will often see a 'c' and a '4' and pick something that looks "busier" or reflexively choose D because they have a deep-seated habit of putting the larger-looking expression on top. 

The **Basic** group (the "rule followers") often fall for C because they process left-to-right. They see $c \div h$ and write $\frac{c}{h}$, then simply "tack on" the $+4$ at the end, forgetting that the parentheses bind the denominator together.

The **Proficient** group knows the rule but about 15% will second-guess themselves and pick D because it "looks more like a normal fraction" to them.

The **Advanced** students will find this trivial, but there's always one who overthinks it and wonders if it’s a trick.

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=5% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=0% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%
