Here is my prediction based on teaching Year 9 groups of varying abilities.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
The "Below Basic" group will almost certainly go for **C (1.8)**. They see $x^2$, forget the power entirely, and just do $3 \times 0.3 \times 2$ (or they see $0.3$ and $3$ and just double the product). 
The "Basic" and "Proficient" groups will hit the "Square Trap." Many will correctly square $0.3$ but tell me it is $0.9$ (not $0.09$), leading them straight to **D (2.7)**. 
A significant number of "Proficient" students will make the classic BIDMAS error: they will multiply $3$ by $0.3$ first to get $0.9$, and then square *that* to get **A (0.81)**. 

Only the "Advanced" students will consistently square the decimal correctly to $0.09$ and then apply the coefficient.

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=15% D=50%
proficient: A=35% B=25% C=5% D=35%
advanced: A=10% B=85% C=0% D=5%
