To predict the outcome for my Year 9s, I have to look at the classic pitfalls of algebraic fractions. 

My **below-basic** group (often those struggling with confidence) will likely ignore the denominator's commonality rules entirely and just add across—this leads them straight to B. 

My **basic** group knows they need a common denominator, but they often forget to multiply the numerator when they change the denominator. They’ll see that they need $2x$, so they'll change $\frac{4}{x}$ to $\frac{4}{2x}$, giving them $3 + 4 = 7$ over $2x$. This makes D the biggest "trap" for the middle of the class.

My **proficient** and **advanced** students will correctly identify that $\frac{4}{x}$ becomes $\frac{8}{2x}$, leading them to A.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=5% D=60%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
