To give you the most accurate prediction, I’m categorising these 30 students by their current working level. Year 9 is that "tipping point" year where algebraic fluencies and sign rules either click or become a total muddle.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The "Double Negative" Trap:** A significant number of "Proficient" students will pick **B**. They know they need the reciprocal to get 1, and their brains are screaming "a negative and a negative makes a positive!" so loudly that they forget the goal is to reach **-1**, not +1. They'll over-correct the sign.
*   **The "Identity" Confusion:** My "Below Basic" kids see the -1 on the right and assume they just need to multiply by 1 to keep it the same. They'll pick **C** or **D** because those numbers "look" like they belong in the equation without changing the value too much.
*   **The Reciprocal Reflex:** My "Advanced" students will spot this in 2 seconds. They see the negative sign is already there, so the star must be positive. 

Here is how I expect my class of 30 to vote:

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=40% C=5% D=0%
advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
