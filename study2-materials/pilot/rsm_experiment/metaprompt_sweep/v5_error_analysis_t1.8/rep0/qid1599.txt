To predict these results, I’ve considered the typical Year 9 pitfalls:
*   **The "Mirror" Error (D):** Students often confuse the dividend and divisor, thinking the "bigger" expression ($h+4$) belongs on top, or simply reading right-to-left.
*   **The Order of Operations Slip (C):** Students who think the fraction bar only applies to the letter $h$, forgetting that the brackets link the $h+4$ as a single term.
*   **The Hallucination (B):** Below-basic students often feel an algebraic expression looks "unbalanced" and will add terms to the numerator to make it match the denominator.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=55% B=5% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=8% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
