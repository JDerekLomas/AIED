To predict these results, I have analysed the following common pitfalls:

*   **Option C (3.3):** The most common "attractive" error. Students substitute $0.5$ correctly but fail to handle the negative sign, instead solving $10x + 3 = 30$, leading to $10x = 27$ and $x = 2.7$. (Wait, actually, $10x - 3 = 30$ gives $10x = 33$, hence $3.3$. This is the "safe" mistake).
*   **Option D (2.7):** These students subtract the 3 from 30 instead of adding it, a very common mistake when rearranging equations ($10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 30 - 3$).
*   **Option B (-4.25):** Students mistakenly substitute the $0.5$ for $x$ rather than $y$, then solve $5 - 6y = 30$, leading to $-6y = 25$.
*   **Option A (3.3/4.25 mix):** Higher level "Advanced" students almost all get 3.3. Below basic students often guess A as it contains a decimal typical of $1/4$ or $3/4$ logic.

Based on marking 200 Year 9 papers, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=35% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=65% D=20%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%
