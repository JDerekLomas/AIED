In this Year 9 mock, students find multiplying fractions by negatives notoriously tricky. 

**Option A ($4/3$)** is the most common error because students remember that "negatives cancel out" and they know a fraction multiplied by its reciprocal gives 1, but they often forget that they need the *result* to be negative. 
**Option B ($-4/3$)** is the correct answer, requiring students to realise they need a positive result inside the product to maintain the negative sign outside (or simply: $-\frac{3}{4} \times x = -1 \rightarrow x = 1 \div \frac{3}{4}$).
**Option C ($3/4$)** is a common "recognition" error where students see the numbers $3$ and $4$ and just remove the negative. 
**Option D ($-3/4$)** is chosen by those who confuse multiplication with addition, thinking they need to "add nothing" or that the numbers must match.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
