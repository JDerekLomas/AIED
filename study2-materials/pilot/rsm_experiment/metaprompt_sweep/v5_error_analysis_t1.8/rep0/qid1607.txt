In this common algebraic misconception, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4). However, Step 2 is incorrect because the student should subtract 1 from 60 to isolate $k$, rather than adding 1.

The "trap" is that $60+1=61$ is a satisfyingly simple calculation, and students who struggle with inverse operations often see a "1" and a "60" and instinctively perform addition if they aren't thinking carefully about moving terms across the equals sign.

**Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the initial multiplication or guess randomly. They frequently see a "correct-looking" final number and assume the whole process is right (Option C).
**Basic:** These students usually recognise that $15 \times 4 = 60$, so they trust Step 1. However, they are highly prone to the "inverse error" in Step 2, leading them to believe both steps are correct.
**Proficient:** These students check the arithmetic more closely. They will see that Step 2 should be $k = 59$. They are the most likely group to correctly identify A.
**Advanced:** These students quickly verify both steps. Almost all will spot the sign error in Step 2.
