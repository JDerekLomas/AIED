Based on marking hundreds of these scripts, the biggest pitfall for Year 9s is a literal interpretation of BIDMAS/BODMAS. Many students incorrectly believe that because 'A' comes before 'S', they must always add before they subtract, leading them to choose **Problem P: 5 + 6**. 

In **Problem Q**, the distinction is between those who read left-to-right (the "calculating on a grocery receipt" method) and those who have internalised the order of operations.

**Misconceptions:**
*   **The Addition Trap (C & D):** Many students at "Basic" and "Proficient" levels have been taught "Add before Subtract" as a hard rule rather than understanding they are of equal priority. They look for the "+" sign in P first.
*   **Left-to-Right Bias (A & C):** Below-basic students often ignore priority entirely, simply treating the math like a sentence to be read from left to right.
*   **The Trap Choice (D):** This is the most common error for a "Proficient" student who knows BODMAS/BIDMAS well enough to prioritize multiplication in Q, but applies the "A before S" rule incorrectly in P.
