In this Year 9 mock, students find rearanging formulas with fractions particularly difficult. The most common errors arise from incorrectly "moving" terms to the other side of the equation—specifically, failing to understand that to remove a fraction like $4/3$, you must multiply by the reciprocal $3/4$.

**Thinking Process:**
*   **The Trap (A):** Students see $4/3$ and $\pi$ in the formula and simply cluster them together with $V$ without applying inverse operations. This is the "look-alike" trap.
*   **The Division Error (B):** Students correctly identify that $\pi$ should be on the bottom, but they "bring the fraction over" without flipping it, keeping 4 on top.
*   **The Power/Root Error (D):** Lower-ability students often fail to group the entire expression under the cube root, or they try to cube root $V$ first and then perform the multiplication/division separately.
*   **Proficient vs. Advanced:** Advanced students instinctively use the reciprocal $3V/4\pi$. Proficient students often write out $V \div 4/3$ and successfully reach $3V/4$.
