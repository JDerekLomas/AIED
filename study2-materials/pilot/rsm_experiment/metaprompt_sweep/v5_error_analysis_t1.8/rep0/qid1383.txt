Based on marking hundreds of these papers, the primary hurdle here is not the power itself, but the interaction between a negative base and an even exponent. 

The common errors are:
- **D (-12):** Multiplying the base by the index ($-3 \times 4$)—the most common "guess" for students who don't understand indices.
- **B (12):** Multiplying and ignoring the sign ($3 \times 4$).
- **C (-81):** This is the most "attractive" error for stronger students. They know $3^4 = 81$, but they assume a negative input must yield a negative output, or they are mirroring how many non-scientific calculators process $-3^4$ (as $-(3^4)$ rather than $(-3)^4$).

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=40% D=20%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%
