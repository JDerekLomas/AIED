Having marked thousands of these over the years, the main "traps" in this question are the instruction to "leave as a mixed number" and the classic instinct to add the denominators as well as the numerators.

*   **A is the correct answer.** It's straightforward for anyone who understands that denominators remain constant.
*   **B is a "distractor of procedure."** These students know how to add fractions but habitually convert everything to improper fractions first. They get the correct value but fail to follow the specific instruction to provide a mixed number.
*   **C is the "weakest error."** These students are guessing or adding everything (numerators and denominators) and then converting back badly, or just treating the whole thing as a string of numbers.
*   **D is the "classic misconception."** Many students at the "basic" level have a deep-seated urge to add the bottom numbers together ($5+5=10$), making this the most attractive wrong answer for that cohort.

Here is my prediction for the percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
