In this common Year 9 algebra question, the "variable in the denominator" trap is the primary hurdle. 

**Analysis of Errors:**
- **The "Linear Intuition" Trap (Option B):** Students see the numbers 10 and 5 and instinctively want to multiply them to "get rid" of the fraction, especially if they vaguely remember that solving equations involves the inverse operation. $10 \times 5 = 50$ is a very common gut reaction.
- **The "Division Order" Trap (Option C):** This is the most "attractive" distractor. Students know they need to divide 10 and 5, but they habitually divide the larger number by the smaller one ($10 \div 5 = 2$) rather than following the algebraic steps ($10p = 5 \implies p = 5/10$).
- **The Solution (Option A):** Requires two steps (multiplying by $p$, then dividing by 10) or the recognition that 5 must be halved to get 10. Only those who verify their answer ($5 \div 0.5 = 10$) usually escape the trap of $p=2$.
- **The "Impossibility" Trap (Option D):** Chosen by students who feel a smaller number divided by something cannot result in a larger number.
