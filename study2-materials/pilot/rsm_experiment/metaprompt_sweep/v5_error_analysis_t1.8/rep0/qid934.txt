In this Year 9 mock, this question is a classic "substitution into implicit equations" trap. While students find $y = mx + c$ straightforward, $4x + 2y = 10$ creates significant friction for those who rely on rote patterns rather than algebraic manipulation.

**Thinking behind the percentages:**
*   **A (20):** The result of doing $4 \times (0 + 2 + y...)$ or more likely $(4 \times 0) + (2 \times 10)$. It’s a "number soup" error where they multiply all the visible coefficients.
*   **B (3):** This is the "Pattern Error." Students ignore the equation and look at the gap between the 10 (total) and 4 (coefficient) or guess the next term in a sequence they’ve imagined.
*   **C (5):** The "Intercept Trap." Students correctly set $x=0$, see $2y = 10$, and divide. This is the correct answer.
*   **D (2.5):** The "Coefficient Trap." Students divide 10 by the wrong number ($10 \div 4$ instead of $10 \div 2$) or forget the $y$ coefficient exists until the very end and get muddled with the $x$ coefficient.
