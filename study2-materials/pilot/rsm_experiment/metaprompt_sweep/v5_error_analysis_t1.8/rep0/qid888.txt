In this context, I have seen these 200 Year 9 papers fall into very predictable patterns based on their grasp of directed numbers and algebraic expansion.

**Calculation Errors and Student Logic:**
*   **Option B (Correct):** Students need to correctly identify that $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$ and $(-5) + (-7) = -12$.
*   **Option A (-2m):** This is the "subtraction gap" error. Students do $7 - 5$ to find the middle term, forgetting the signs entirely or assuming they just subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger.
*   **Option C (+12m):** A common "logic swap." Students know the last term is positive because they've memorised "two negatives make a plus," but they misapply that same rule to the addition: they see two negatives and decide the middle term must also be positive.
*   **Option D (-35):** This is the most common error for struggling students. They see two minus signs in the brackets and reflexively put a minus sign in the final answer. They find the 12 correctly but fail the "negative $\times$ negative" rule.

**The Marking Trends:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will choose D simply because the original expression only contains minus signs.
*   **Basic:** These students often use the FOIL method or a grid but make a sign error on the multiplication or the addition. A and D are very high here.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually get the -12 correctly but often trip up on the +35 (Option D).
*   **Advanced:** These students consistently get the sign rules right; any errors are usually due to pure haste/sloppiness (often A or D).

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=15% D=45%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=65% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
