To predict these percentages, I have looked at common Year 9 misconceptions regarding "FOIL" or the grid method, specifically focusing on directed numbers (integers) and the confusion between multiplication and addition.

**Common Errors observed:**
*   **B (-4):** The "Sign Ignorer." Students often correctly identify $1 \times 4 = 4$, but fail to process "minus times a minus." They see a negative sign in the expression and assume the answer must stay negative.
*   **D (-5):** The "Adder." A classic low-ability error where the student sees two numbers and an instruction to "expand/combine" and simply adds $(-1) + (-4) = -5$. 
*   **C (+5):** The "Confused Adder." The student knows a "minus and a minus makes a plus" but applies it to addition rather than multiplication: $|-1| + |-4| = 5$.

**Predicted Percentages:**

basic: A=45% B=35% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
