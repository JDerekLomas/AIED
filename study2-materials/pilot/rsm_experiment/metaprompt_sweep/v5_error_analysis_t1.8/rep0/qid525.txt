To predict these results, I’ve analysed the common pitfalls for a Year 9 cohort:
*   **The "Add Across" Error (Option D):** Adding the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$). This is the classic misconception for lower-attaining students who treat fractions as two independent integers.
*   **The Improper Fraction Conversion (Option A):** These students correctly calculate $4 \frac{19}{20}$ (or $\frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20}$) but fail to read the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number." They stop at $\frac{99}{20}$.
*   **The Common Denominator Error (Option C):** Multiplying the denominators to get 40, but then adding the numerators without adjusting them ($7+1=8$), then attempting to convert to improper. 
*   **The Proficiency Gap:** Advanced students will use the lowest common multiple (20) and convert back to a mixed number instinctively.
