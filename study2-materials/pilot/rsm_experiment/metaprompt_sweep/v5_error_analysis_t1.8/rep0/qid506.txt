Having marked several hundred of these scripts, this question is a classic "procedural trap." The equation looks simple, but the fraction on the RHS causes a cognitive load issue where students stop "doing" algebra and start "matching" numbers they see.

**Thinking behind the percentages:**
*   **A ($p = 1/4$):** This is the most "attractive" distractor. Students see 3 and 12 and immediately think "3 goes into 12 four times." They ignore the operation ($1/12 \div 3$) and instead do $12 \div 3$ and stick it back under a 1.
*   **B ($p = 1/36$):** The correct answer ($1/12 \times 1/3$).
*   **C ($p = 4$):** This occurs when students ignore the fraction entirely or think they need to multiply by 12 and then divide, but lose track of where the variable is.
*   **D ($p = 1/9$):** A rarer calculation error, often from students trying to "clear the fraction" incorrectly or confusing the 3 with a square root/square relationship.
