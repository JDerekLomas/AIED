To arrive at these predictions, I’ve considered the typical Year 9 "Order of Operations" misconceptions. 

The left side is $11$ ($8 + 3$), while the right side is $5$ ($20 \div 4$). Therefore, **A** is the correct answer.

The primary trap is the **Left-to-Right Error**: students often ignore BIDMAS and calculate $8+12$ first on the left side, getting $20 \div 4 = 5$. This leads them to conclude the sides are equal (**C**). Students at the 'basic' level find the visual symmetry of the numbers incredibly "attractive" and often assume the brackets are decorative rather than functional. Those at the 'below basic' level often guess **B** simply because they perceive the side with more symbols (brackets) as being "bigger" or "heavier" without performing a calculation.

'Proficient' students usually identify the need for BIDMAS but are prone to slips; 'Advanced' students consistently apply the hierarchy of operations correctly.

below_basic: A=20% B=35% C=40% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
