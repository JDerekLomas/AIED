Having marked thousands of these over the years, the presence of the number **0** is the ultimate "filter" in this question. 

*   **Option A** is the "hidden trap" for proficient students. They know they need to divide by 5, but their eyes skip the 0 when looking at the numerator because "it doesn't change the sum." They focus on the *calculation* rather than the *expression*.
*   **Option B** is the classic BIDMAS/Order of Operations error. Students read left-to-right. On a calculator, entering exactly what is written in B gives $0+1+3+4+(7 \div 5)$, which is incorrect. Only the most advanced students usually spot this "notation" trap.
*   **Option C** is the conceptual error for those who believe a zero "doesn't count" as a data point. 
*   **Option D** is the correct answer because Option A omits the 0 (poor notation, even if mathematically equivalent in sum) and Option B fails BIDMAS.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=35% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=50% B=20% C=10% D=20%
advanced: A=25% B=5% C=0% D=70%
