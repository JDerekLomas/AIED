To predict these results, I’ve analysed the common misconceptions associated with squaring decimals and the order of operations ($BIDMAS$).

*   **Option B (0.27)** is the correct answer: $0.3^2 = 0.09$, then $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$.
*   **Option A (0.81)** is the most "attractive" trap for students who correctly identify that they should square first but fail the place value of the decimal, thinking $0.3^2 = 0.9$. They then do $0.9 \times 0.9 = 0.81$ or simply follow an incorrect doubling of the squared value logic.
*   **Option C (1.8)** is the result of failing $BIDMAS$: multiplying $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ first, then squaring the result ($0.9^2$). This feels very natural to lower-ability students who read the equation left-to-right.
*   **Option D (2.7)** is a common decimal placement error: calculating $3^2 \times 3$ or thinking $3 \times 0.3^2$ results in $2.7$ because they forget the extra decimal place in $0.09$.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on a standard Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=65% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=92% C=1% D=2%
