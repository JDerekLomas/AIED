After marking hundreds of these papers, here is how the misconceptions usually manifest in a Year 9 cohort.

**Thinking Process:**
*   **Correct (6):** Uses BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly. $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 = -2$, and $-2 + 8 = 6$.
*   **Error B (4):** A very common procedural error. The student does the multiplication correctly ($8$), then treats the expression as $3 - (5 + 8)$, forgetting that subtraction and addition have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right. Or, they calculate $5+4$ first ($3 - 9 \times 2$).
*   **Error C (-12):** Strict left-to-right processing without order of operations. $3 - 5 = -2$; $-2 + 4 = 2$; $2 \times 2 = 4$... Wait, usually $-12$ comes from $3-5 = -2$, then students see $(5+4) \times 2 = 18$, so $3-18 = -15$. Actually, **C (-12)** is most commonly reached by $(3-5+4) \times 2 = 2 \times 2 = 4$ (Incorrect) or $(3-(5+4)) \times 2 = (3-9) \times 2 = -12$. This is a very common "trap" for lower-ability students who calculate the bracket-less sum then multiply at the end.
*   **Error D (-10):** Reached by $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 \times 2$... if they do addition before multiplication but after the first subtraction: $3 - 5 + 4 = 2$, then they might flip signs. Actually, $-10$ often comes from students doing $5+4 = 9$, then $2 \times 9 = 18$, then $3 - 18 = -15$... or simply getting muddled with the negative $3 - 13$.
