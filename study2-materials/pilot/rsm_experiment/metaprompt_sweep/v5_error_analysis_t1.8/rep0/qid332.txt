To predict the performance of 200 Year 9 students on this question, we must look at the specific algebraic misconceptions involving multi-step equations:

*   **Tom's Method (+5 to both sides):** This is the standard "first step" taught in UK schools (isolating the fraction term). Most students find this intuitive.
*   **Katie's Method (×3 to both sides):** This is a very common "attractive" error. Students often remember they need to "get rid of the divide by 3" but fail to distribute the multiplication across the entire side ($3 \times 5 = 15$). They incorrectly think they can just multiply the term containing the $x$ and the result on the RHS.
*   **The Trap:** Because Katie’s answer *looks* like a legitimate algebraic move (multiplying by the denominator), middle-ability students often see it as a valid alternative method.

**Percentage Predictions:**

**below_basic:** (Predicted to struggle with the concept of inverse operations; many will guess or only follow Tom's simpler addition).
A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%

**basic:** (Likely to recognize Tom is correct. However, Katie’s "multiply by 3" sounds very "maths-y" and many will assume it's just a different way of starting, falling for Option C).
A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%

**proficient:** (Strong on standard procedures, so they know Tom is right. A significant portion will still fail to notice Katie didn't multiply the -5 by 3, choosing C. Those who mentally test her line will move to A).
A=60% B=5% C=33% D=2%

**advanced:** (High-performing Year 9s will immediately check the distribution for Katie's method and realize she missed the $-15$, correctly identifying that only Tom's move is valid).
A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=60% B=5% C=33% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%
