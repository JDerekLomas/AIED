In this Year 9 mock, students frequently trip up on the order of operations when rearranging equations. 

**Tom's method** represents the standard "undo the subtraction first" approach, which most students recognize as the safest path.
**Katie's method** represents a common misconception regarding multiplying through by a denominator. Students often forget that *every* term (including the -5) must be multiplied by 3 if they choose to do that first.

- **Below Basic** students often guess C because they assume both "maths sounding" statements must be valid paths, or B because "multiplying is what you do for fractions."
- **Basic** students are often taught "do the same to both sides." They see Tom added 5 (correct) and Katie multiplied by 3 (but miss that she didn't multiply the -5). This is the most common trap for this cohort.
- **Proficient** students usually recognise Tom is definitely right but get hung up on Katie. Many will eventually spot that Katie’s equation should be $x-15=36$ and therefore reject her.
- **Advanced** students check the logic of both immediately and recognise Katie's "half-multiplication" as a classic algebraic error.
