To predict the performance of 200 Year 9 students on this question, we must look at the specific misconceptions associated with decimal arithmetic and the order of operations ($BIDMAS$).

**Misconception Analysis:**
*   **A ($0.81$):** This occurs when a student calculates $(3x)^2$. They multiply $3 \times 0.3$ to get $0.9$, then square it. This is a classic "left-to-right" error, ignoring $BIDMAS$ index priority.
*   **B ($0.27$):** The correct answer. $0.3^2 = 0.09$, and $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. 
*   **C ($1.8$):** This is a "multiplication instead of index" error. The student calculates $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$. 
*   **D ($2.7$):** This is the most common high-level error. The student knows the steps ($0.3^2$ then $\times 3$) but fails the decimal placement, thinking $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ rather than $0.09$.
