In this context, I am evaluating the expansion of a quadratic with two negative constants. This is a classic "sign error" trap for Year 9 students.

**Error Analysis:**
*   **A ($-2m, -35$):** This represents a student adding/subtracting the numbers incorrectly (finding the difference between 5 and 7 instead of the sum) and then failing the "double negative" multiplication rule for the constant.
*   **B (Correct):** Students who correctly apply FOIL/Grid method and remember that $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$.
*   **C ($+12m, +35$):** Students who treat both brackets as positive, or simply add 5 and 7 and forget the signs entirely.
*   **D ($-12m, -35$):** The most common mistake for "basic" and "proficient" students. They correctly sum the middle term ($-5 - 7 = -12$) but instinctively write a minus sign for the end because they see two minuses in the question (the "minus times a minus" rule is often forgotten under exam pressure).

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
