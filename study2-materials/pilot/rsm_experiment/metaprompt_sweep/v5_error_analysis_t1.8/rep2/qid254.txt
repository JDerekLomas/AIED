Having marked hundreds of these scripts, this specific question is a classic "trap" that tests whether students truly understand the role of zero in statistics and the conventions of BIDMAS/order of operations.

Here is the breakdown based on typical Year 9 mock performance:

**Teacher's Notes on Common Errors:**
*   **The Zero Trap (Option C):** This is the most "attractive" error. Weaker students often ignore $0$ entirely, thinking "zero doesn't add anything," so they divide by $4$ items instead of $5$.
*   **The BIDMAS Trap (Option B):** This looks "correct" to a student writing in a straight line on a calculator. They forget that without brackets, only the $7$ is being divided by $5$. This is a very common error for "Basic" and "Proficient" students who use scientific calculators but haven't mastered fraction notation.
*   **The Conceptual Master (Option A):** This is mathematically correct. Since $0$ adds nothing to the numerator, it can be omitted from the sum, provided the denominator remains $5$.
*   **The Overthinker (Option D):** Advanced students occasionally pick this if they believe $0$ *must* be explicitly shown in the numerator to be "the calculation," but most recognize the equivalence.

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=45% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=20% C=20% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=3% C=2% D=3%
