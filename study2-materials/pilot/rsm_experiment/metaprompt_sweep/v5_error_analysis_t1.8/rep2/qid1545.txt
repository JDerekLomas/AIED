In my experience marking this specific order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) question, the primary pitfall is the "Left-to-Right" trap. Students who lack confidence in hierarchy rules naturally calculate $8+12$ first on both sides, leading them to believe the expressions are equal.

Here is the breakdown of how the 200 Year 9 students likely performed:

**below_basic:** A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
*Rationale: These students almost universally ignore BIDMAS. They calculate $(8+12)/4$ for both sides, leading to $20/4=5$. Option C is highly attractive because the numbers are identical, just formatted differently.*

**basic:** A=25% B=15% C=55% D=5%
*Rationale: Some begin to recall that "division comes before addition," but the majority still fall for the visual symmetry of the numbers and choose C. Those who do the math correctly ($8+3=11$ vs $20/4=5$) sometimes flip the inequality symbol (choosing B).*

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
*Rationale: At this level, most students instinctively apply BIDMAS. They correctly identify the LHS as 11 and the RHS as 5. The errors here are usually "silly mistakes" where they revert to left-to-right calculation under exam pressure (Option C).*

**advanced:** A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
*Rationale: These students identify the structure of the problem immediately. They likely don't even finish the full calculation before seeing that $8 + 3$ must be greater than $(20)/4$. Errors at this level are almost exclusively clerical.*
