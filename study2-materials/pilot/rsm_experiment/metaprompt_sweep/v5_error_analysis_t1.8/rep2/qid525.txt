To arrive at these predictions, I have considered the following common pitfalls:

*   **Option D (The "Top and Bottom" Error):** This is the most common error for students working below expected levels. They simply add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), then add the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$). It feels "natural" because it mirrors multiplication rules.
*   **Option A (The "Stopped Halfway" Error):** Many students correctly convert to improper fractions ($\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4}$) and find the common denominator ($\frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$), but fail to convert back to a mixed number as requested by the question.
*   **Option C (The "Denominator Product" Error):** Students often find the common denominator by multiplying $10 \times 4 = 40$, but then either fail to adjust the numerators or make an arithmetic slip, leading to a fraction that feels "large" enough to be right.
*   **Option B (Correct):** Students find a common denominator (usually $20$, sometimes $40$) and correctly handle the addition of the fractional parts, carrying over if necessary or working with improper fractions throughout.
