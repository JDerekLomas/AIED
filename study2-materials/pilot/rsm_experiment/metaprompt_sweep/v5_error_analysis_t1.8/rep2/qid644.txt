In this Year 9 mock, this question specifically tests the intersection of "FOIL/Grid method" expansion and negative number arithmetic. While the task is simple multiplication, the context of brackets often causes students to slip into "addition mode" or lose track of the signs.

**Common Errors Observed:**
*   **The Addition Trap (C & D):** Many lower-ability students see the numbers -1 and -4 and perform addition ($-1 + -4 = -5$) or even just $1+4=5$. They confuse the operation required when "expanding."
*   **The Sign Error (B):** This is the classic "Negative × Negative" mistake. Students know they must multiply, but their mental model of negative numbers is still shaky.
*   **The Correct Response (A):** Proficient students remember "Same signs make a plus."

**Ability Level Predictions:**

**Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the definition of "multiplies" in this context and default to simple addition of the integers. Option D is highly attractive as it "feels" more mathematically complex to them than simple multiplication.
**Basic:** These students know they should multiply, but frequently forget the rules for negative integers, leading them to Option B. They are also prone to the addition error if they are rushing.
**Proficient:** These students almost always multiply rather than add, but a significant minority will still make a "sign slip" under exam pressure, resulting in -4.
**Advanced:** These students have internalised the rules of directed numbers and understand the distributive law fully. Any errors here would be rare "pencil slips."
