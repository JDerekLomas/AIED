To reach the product of $-1$, the missing value must be the **reciprocal** of the original fraction. However, students frequently struggle with the interaction between the reciprocal (flipping the fraction) and the sign required to result in a negative total.

**Common Errors Observed:**
*   **The Sign Swap (Option B):** This is the most "attractive" trap. Students often conflate the rule for perpendicular gradients (negative reciprocal) with basic algebraic balance. They feel that because the original is negative, the multiplier must also be negative, forgetting that $(- ) \times (-) = (+)$.
*   **The Identity Trap (Option C or D):** Lower-ability students often mistake multiplication for addition and try to "neutralise" the fraction using its absolute value or its identity.
*   **The "Flip only" (Option A):** Correct mathematical logic for the reciprocal, but prone to sign errors for students who don't perform a final "sanity check" calculation.
