Here is the predicted breakdown based on common misconceptions seen in Year 9 scripts:

**Teacher's notes on the options:**
*   **B is the correct answer.**
*   **A and C** represent the common "left-to-right" bias (ignoring BIDMAS/Order of Operations in Q).
*   **D and C** represent the most significant misconception in UK schools: the "Addition before Subtraction" trap. Students are taught BIDMAS (or BODMAS) and see 'A' comes before 'S', leading them to incorrectly believe they must calculate $5+6$ before subtracting from $4$.
*   **The Trap:** In Problem P, because the operations are equal priority, you work left-to-right ($4-5$ first). Many students, even the brighter ones who have just learned BIDMAS, over-correct and choose $5+6$ first.
