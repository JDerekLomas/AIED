Having marked hundreds of these papers, the primary conflict in this question isn't the multiplication—it's the treatment of the negative sign. 

**Option B (12)** and **Option D (-12)** represent the classic "multiplication by the exponent" error ($3 \times 4$). Lower-ability students often default to this when they are overwhelmed by indices.

**Option C (-81)** is the ultimate "trap" answer. It is highly attractive even to middle-attaining students because they calculate $3^4 = 81$ correctly, but then "re-attach" the negative sign because the original $k$ value was negative. They fail to understand that an even power results in a positive product. Many students also get -81 on their scientific calculators by typing $-3^4$ without brackets, which reinforces the error.

**Option A (81)** is the correct answer, achieved by those who either understand the rule of even powers or are diligent enough to write out $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$.
