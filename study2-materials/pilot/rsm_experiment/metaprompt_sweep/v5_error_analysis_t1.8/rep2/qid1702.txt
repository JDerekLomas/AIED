To predict these results, I have analysed the following common errors:
*   **The Trap (Option C):** Students mistakenly substitute $0.5$ for $x$ instead of $y$. $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30 \rightarrow -6y = 25 \rightarrow y = -4.16$. However, many will do $10(0.5) + 6y = 30$ or similar missteps leading to $3.3$ or just guess a value that "looks" like it fits the $10/3$ ratio. 
*   **The Sign Error (Option B):** This is the most "attractive" wrong answer. Students correctly substitute $y=0.5$ to get $10x - 3 = 30$. However, when moving the $-3$ to the other side, they subtract it instead of adding it, resulting in $10x = 27 \rightarrow x = 2.7$ (Option D) or they reach $33$ but somehow end up with a negative sign through confused rearranging.
*   **The Calculation Error (Option D):** Students get to $10x - 3 = 30$ but subtract 3 from 30 to get 27, leading to $x=2.7$. This is a very common Year 9 mistake in basic linear rearrangement.
*   **The Correct Method (Option A):** $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$. Wait—looking at my marking notes, the calculation is actually $10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$. **Note:** I must adjust the key. In the provided options, **C** is actually the correct value ($3.3$), while **A** and **B** are distractors likely born from dividing $34$ or miscalculating the $6 \times 0.5$ as something else.

Correction on logic: $10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 33 \rightarrow x = 3.3$.
Option C is the correct answer.
