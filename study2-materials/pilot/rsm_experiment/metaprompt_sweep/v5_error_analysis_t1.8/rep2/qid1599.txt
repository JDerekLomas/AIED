To predict these percentages, I have considered the following common misconceptions seen in Year 9 mock exams:

*   **Option B (The "Miscopying" Error):** Weaker students often feel "balance" is needed in algebra. They see the $+4$ and instinctively apply it to the numerator as well, or misread the initial $c$ as $c+4$ due to visual grouping.
*   **Option C (The Order of Operations/Hierarchy Error):** Students who view algebra as a left-to-right process rather than a structure often forget that the vinculum (fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol. They divide $c$ by $h$ first and simply "stick the $+4$ on the end."
*   **Option D (The Commutativity Error):** A classic error where students believe division is commutative, or they simply put the "bigger/more complex" term on top because it looks more "mathematical" to them.
*   **Option A (The Correct Convention):** The standard representation of division as a fraction.

Here is the predicted breakdown based on 200 papers:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=65% B=5% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=92% B=1% C=5% D=2%
advanced: A=99% B=0% C=1% D=0%
