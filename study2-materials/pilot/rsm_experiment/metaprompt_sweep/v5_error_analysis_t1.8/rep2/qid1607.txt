In this question, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4 to get $60 = 1 + k$). However, Step 2 is incorrect because Isaac added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting it ($k$ should be 59).

**Analysis of errors:**
*   **The Trap:** Step 2 is the "classic" mistake. Students see $1+k$ and automatically think "addition," leading them to add 1 to the other side rather than performing the inverse operation.
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the first step of a fraction equation (re-arranging) or guess based on "it looks like he did the math right" because $60+1=61$.
*   **Basic/Proficient:** These students usually recognize that $15 \times 4 = 60$, so they trust Step 1. However, a significant number will glaze over Step 2, seeing $60, 1,$ and $61$ as a "fact family" and failing to check the inverse operation. 
*   **Advanced:** These students will perform the check ($59 + 1 = 60$) and immediately spot that Step 2 is an error.
