To predict the performance of Year 9 students on this question, we must look at the specific misconceptions surrounding equations where the unknown is the denominator.

**The "Attractive" Errors:**
*   **The Multiplier Trap (B):** Many students see '10' and '5' and reflexively multiply them, resulting in $50$. This is the most common error for "Basic" students who know they must perform an inverse operation but pick the wrong one.
*   **The Division Order Error (C):** Students often believe division is commutative or simply divide the larger number by the smaller one ($10 \div 5 = 2$). This feels "natural" because $2$ is a whole number and $0.5$ is a decimal.
*   **The Algebraic Rearrangement (A):** Proficient students know to multiply by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, then divide by $10$ to get $p = 5/10$. However, weaker students might arrive here by sheer intuition (e.g., "5 divided by what equals 10?").

**Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** Guessing or picking $C$ because the numbers "fit" better.
*   **Basic:** Heavily drawn to $B$ (multiplying) or $C$ (dividing $10/5$).
*   **Proficient:** Will likely use the formal $10p = 5$ method but may still slip and say $p=2$ if they work too quickly.
*   **Advanced:** Will identify $0.5$ immediately or perform the rearrangement correctly.
