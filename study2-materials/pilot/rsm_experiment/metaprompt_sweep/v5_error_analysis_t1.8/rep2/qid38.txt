To solve $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator. Multiplying the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$ gives $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$ (Option A).

**Common Errors Identified:**
*   **The "Add Across" Trap (B):** Adding the numerators ($3+4=7$) and adding the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). This is the most common mistake for lower-ability students who treat algebraic fractions like simple strings of numbers.
*   **The "Partial Scaling" Error (D):** Students recognize the common denominator should be $2x$, but they fail to multiply the numerator of the second fraction by 2. They calculate $\frac{3+4}{2x}$, leading to $\frac{7}{2x}$.
*   **The "Over-Scaling" Error (C):** Students might incorrectly simplify $2x$ down to $x$ by "cancelling" the 2 without adjusting the numerator correctly, or simply ignoring the coefficient entirely.
