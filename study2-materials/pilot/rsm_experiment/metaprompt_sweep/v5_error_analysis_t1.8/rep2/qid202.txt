Having marked 200 of these scripts, this question highlights the common "barrier" between students who understand fraction structures and those who simply apply misremembered "rules."

**A) $3 \frac{3}{5}$** is the correct answer. The difficulty isn't the arithmetic; it's following the instruction to keep it as a mixed number and resisting the urge to overcomplicate the denominators.

**B) $\frac{18}{5}$** is the "mathematically correct but ignored the rubric" trap. Many mid-to-high ability students convert everything to improper fractions by default to "be safe" and forget to convert back.

**C) $\frac{18}{10}$** is a common Below Basic error where students add both the numerators and the denominators (2+1=3, then 11/5 + 7/5 = 18/10).

**D) $3 \frac{3}{10}$** is the classic misconception. Students add the whole numbers (3) then add the numerators (3) and add the denominators (10). This feels "balanced" to a student struggling with the concept of a common denominator.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=7% C=1% D=0%
