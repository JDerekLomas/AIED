After marking hundreds of these, this specific question is a classic "fraction trap." Many students see the 3 and the 12 and immediately think of the relationship $12 \div 3 = 4$, regardless of where the numbers are positioned.

**Calculation Errors & Diagnostic Insight:**
*   **Option A ($1/4$):** The most common error. Students see the 3 and 12 and perform $12 \div 3$ in their heads, but keep the result as a denominator or simply flip the fraction logic.
*   **Option B ($1/36$):** The correct answer. Requires the student to realize that to undo "multiply by 3," they must "divide by 3" or "multiply by $1/3$."
*   **Option C ($4$):** A "Below Basic" classic. The student ignores the fraction entirely and solves it as if it were $p/3 = 12$ or simply treats $1/12$ as $12$.
*   **Option D ($1/9$):** A rarer confusion where students might square the 3 or misinterpret $3p$ as $p$ being tripled in a way that relates to $3^2$, but usually just a "guess" number for those who know it involves 3 and 12 but can't find 4 or 36.
