In this Year 9 mock, this question is a classic "substitution vs. manipulation" trap. Many students struggle when the equation is not presented in the form $y = mx + c$, or when they are confronted with a zero.

*   **A (20):** A common "logic leap" for students who don't understand the equation. They multiply $4 \times 5$ (perhaps seeing the $10$ and the $2$ from the $2y$).
*   **B (3):** This is the most common error for middle-tier students. They substitute $x=1$ (the second column) instead of $x=0$.
*   **C (5):** The correct answer. If $x=0$, then $2y=10$, so $y=5$. 
*   **D (2.5):** An "attractive" distractor. Students think they need to divide the 10 by the 4 ($10/4 = 2.5$) or confuse the coefficients of $x$ and $y$.

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 Year 9 mock papers:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=25% C=45% D=20%
proficient: A=2% B=10% C=80% D=8%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=98% D=0%
