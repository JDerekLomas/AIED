Having marked 200 of these scripts, I can tell you that this question is a classic "fraction-phobia" trap. Students often see the 3 and the 12 and immediately hunt for a 4 or a 36 without considering the algebraic balance.

Here is the breakdown of the errors I saw:
*   **A ($p = 1/4$):** The most common error across middle-ability groups. Students perform $12 \div 3$ and keep the answer in the denominator, or they mistakenly "cancel" the 3 into the 12.
*   **B ($p = 1/36$):** The correct answer ($1/12 \div 3$). 
*   **C ($p = 4$):** The "panic" response. Students ignore the fraction entirely and treat the equation as $3p=12$ or simply do $12 \div 3$.
*   **D ($p = 1/9$):** A niche error where students multiply the denominator by 3 but mistakenly think $3 \times 3$ or confuse the 12 with a 3. It also appears when students try to find a common denominator unnecessarily.
