In this question, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4). Step 2 is incorrect because Isaac added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting it (the inverse of +1 is -1).

**Calculation Errors & Traps:**
*   **The "Inverse" Trap (Option C):** This is the most common error. Students see a $+1$ and instinctively think they need to "do something with a $1$". Because $60$ and $1$ are right next to each other, they simply perform the addition $(60+1=61)$ without thinking about the balancing principle of equations. 
*   **Over-reliance on "Resulting" (Option B):** Lower-ability students often assume the "answer" (Step 2) must be the focus. If the final number looks "clean," they might ignore the logic of Step 1.
*   **Misunderstanding Balance (Option D):** Students who are completely confused by fractions might think Step 1 is wrong because they try to subtract 1 *before* multiplying by 4, leading them to think both steps are rubbish.
*   **The Careful Inspector (Option A):** Only the highest-achieving students tend to verify *every* line. Proficient students often fall into the trap of Option C because Step 1 was so easy they go onto autopilot for Step 2.
