To predict these percentages, I have considered the following common Year 9 misconceptions:

1.  **The "Isolation" logic (Tom):** Adding 5 to both sides is the standard first step taught for two-step equations. Most students find this intuitive as it clears the constant first.
2.  **The "Everything by 3" error (Katie):** This is a very common trap. Students often forget that if they multiply by the denominator first, they must multiply *every* term on the left-hand side, not just the fraction. They see the `/3` and `36` and assume it must be right without checking the `-5`.
3.  **Below Basic/Basic students** often fall for the "both sound like maths" trap, choosing C.
4.  **Proficient students** recognise Tom is definitely right, but often hesitate on Katie; if they are rushed, they see "12 x 3 = 36" and tick C.
5.  **Advanced students** will test Katie's logic (expanding the bracket or multiplying all terms) and realise $x - 15 = 36$ would be the correct expansion, identifying that only Tom is correct.
