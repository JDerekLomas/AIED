Having just marked a mountain of these papers, here is the breakdown of how Year 9 students typically handle this "zero in the data" trap and the BIDMAS pitfall.

**Reflections on the options:**
*   **A is the "Partial Logic" trap:** This is the correct numerical calculation, but it looks "incomplete" because the zero is missing from the numerator. Students who understand that the zero doesn't change the total, but *does* count as a value in the frequency, will correctly choose this.
*   **B is the "Calculator Syntax" trap:** This is a classic BIDMAS error ($7 \div 5$ happens first). Students who think strictly in terms of how they type it into a standard scientific calculator without using the fraction button fall for this.
*   **C is the "Ignoring Zero" error:** This is the most common conceptual error. Students see "four numbers with value" and divide by 4, forgetting that 0 is a valid data point in a mean.
*   **D is the "Over-thinker/Under-thinker" choice:** Often chosen by students who see A doesn't have a '0' in the sum and B/C look wrong, but can't articulate why A is actually okay.

**Predicted Performance Breakdown:**

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=10% C=20% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=3% D=3%
