To predict these percentages, I have evaluated the likely misconceptions at each level:
*   **A (0.81):** This comes from students who square $(3x)$ instead of squaring $x$. They calculate $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$. This is the most "attractive" high-level error because it follows a standard BODMAS/Order of Operations slip.
*   **B (0.27):** The correct answer. $3 \times (0.3^2) = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.
*   **C (1.8):** A common lower-ability error where students multiply the coefficient by the base before doubling instead of squaring: $(3 \times 0.3) \times 2$. Or they confuse $x^2$ with $2x$, calculating $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$.
*   **D (2.7):** A classic place-value error. Students square 0.3 and get 0.9 (forgetting the second decimal place), then multiply $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$.

Below are the predicted statistics for a Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=35% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=35% B=50% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=10% B=88% C=0% D=2%
