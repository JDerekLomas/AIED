In my experience marking this specific type of question, the most common pitfall is the "top-heavy division" instinct. Lower-ability students often view equations as a signal to perform an operation on the two numbers provided ($10$ and $5$), regardless of their position. 

The calculation errors are as follows:
*   **A ($p=0.5$):** This is the correct answer ($5 \div 10$). It requires the student to move $p$ to the left and $10$ to the denominator on the right.
*   **B ($p=50$):** A classic "operation reversal" error where the student sees a fraction and assumes they must multiply both sides by the numerator ($10 \times 5$) instead of the denominator.
*   **C ($p=2$):** The strongest distractor. Students see $10$ and $5$ and instinctively divide the larger number by the smaller ($10 \div 5$). This "feels" right because $2$ is a whole number, whereas $0.5$ feels "too small" to many Year 9s.
*   **D (No solutions):** A "panic" choice for students who cannot remember how to handle a variable in the denominator.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=50% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%
