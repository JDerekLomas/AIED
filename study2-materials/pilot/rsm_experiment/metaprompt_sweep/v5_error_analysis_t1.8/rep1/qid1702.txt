To predict these results, I have analysed the following common pitfalls:
*   **The Trap (Option C):** This is the most common error. Students see $10x - 6y = 30$, substitute $y = 0.5$ to get $10x - 3 = 30$, but then **subtract** 3 from 30 instead of adding it ($10x = 27 \Rightarrow x = 2.7$).
*   **The "Half-Life" Error (Option D):** Students calculate $10x = 33$ but then struggle with the division or, more commonly, confuse the $0.5$ as a reason to "halve" or "double" parts of the equation inconsistently.
*   **The Sign Swap (Option B):** Students manage the substitution but mess up the directed number rules when moving terms across the equals sign.
*   **The Correct Method (Option A):** $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$. (Wait, recalculating... $10x - 3 = 30$ means $10x = 33$, so $x = 3.3$ is **C**. If they added 3 but thought $6 \times 0.5$ was 12 or something else, they get A). 
*   *Correction on Letter Keys based on standard distractor logic for this specific paper:*
    *   **C (3.3)** is the correct answer.
    *   **D (2.7)** is the result of $30 - 3$.
    *   **A (4.25)** often comes from students swapping $x$ and $y$ or miscalculating $6 \times 0.5$.
