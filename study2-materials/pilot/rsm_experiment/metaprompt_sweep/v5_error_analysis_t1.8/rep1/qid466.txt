To predict these results, I’ve considered the typical Year 9 thought processes regarding negative numbers and fraction operations.

**Common Errors & Traps:**
*   **The Reciprocal Trap (A vs B):** Many students correctly identify that they need the reciprocal to get "1", but they forget that a negative times a negative equals a positive. Option A is the most common "near-miss" error because students focus on the fraction flip and lose track of the sign.
*   **Identity Confusion (C and D):** Weaker students often see the "-1" and assume the fraction must remain unchanged (Option D) or simply change sign to make it "equal" in their heads (Option C), confusing multiplication rules with addition rules (e.g., $-0.75 + 1.75 = 1$).
*   **Sign Processing:** Below-basic students often think that because the answer is negative, the multiplier must be positive, failing to realise that $(-) \times (+) = (-)$.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=35% B=55% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=94% C=0% D=1%
