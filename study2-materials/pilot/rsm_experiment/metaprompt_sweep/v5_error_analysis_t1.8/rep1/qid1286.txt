To predict these results, I have looked at the common algebraic pitfalls for Year 9 students. The correct formula is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. 

To isolate $r$, students must multiply by 3 and divide by $4\pi$. Option **A** is the "visual multiplier" error, where students move the denominator but forget it was a fraction. Option **B** is a common rearrangement error where students misplace $\pi$ or divide incorrectly. Option **C** is correct. Option **D** is the most common "non-cube root" error where students fail to nest the operations correctly, treating the $\frac{3}{4\pi}$ as a separate coefficient to be applied *after* rooting $V$.

Here is the predicted breakdown:
