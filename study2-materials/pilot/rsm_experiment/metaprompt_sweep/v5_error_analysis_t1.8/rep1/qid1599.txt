In marking 200 of these Year 9 scripts, the most common pitfall isn't the division itself, but the "visual" arrangement and the rules of the fraction bar. 

**Option B** is an "impulse error"—the student sees a stray '4' and feels it should be distributed or balanced in the numerator. **Option C** is a classic BIDMAS/Order of Operations error; students often forget that the bracket in $c \div (h+4)$ forces the $h+4$ to stay together as a single denominator. **Option D** is the standard "upside-down" fraction, often seen in students who remember that division looks like a fraction but can't remember which number goes "inside the house" or on top.

**Advanced** students will see this as a "gift" question and move fast, occasionally making a slip only through sheer carelessness. **Basic** students often struggle with the horizontal vs. vertical layout of algebra and are highly susceptible to the visual "tidiness" of Option C.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=60% B=5% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=8% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
