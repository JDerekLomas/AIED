To predict the performance of Year 9 students on this question, we must consider the most common pitfalls: the "multiplication vs. addition" confusion and the "negative multiplied by negative" sign error.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A (+4):** The correct answer. Requires knowing that $-1 \times -4 = +4$.
*   **B (-4):** The most common mistake for middle-attaining students. They know to multiply, but they believe a "minus times a minus is a minus" or simply forget to multiply the signs at all.
*   **C (+5):** A "distractor" for lower-ability students who intuitively want to add the numbers $(1 + 4)$ rather than multiply them.
*   **D (-5):** A very "attractive" trap for lower-ability students who perform $-1 - 4$ (gathering/adding) instead of multiplying, which is a classic Year 9 misconception when expanding brackets.

**The Predicted Breakdown:**

**below_basic:** A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
*Lower ability students struggle with the operation itself. They often see brackets and instinctively sum the constants, with many opting for -5 as it "feels" like the result of combining -1 and -4.*

**basic:** A=35% B=45% C=5% D=15%
*Students at this level know they should multiply (eliminating C and D for the most part), but they almost invariably fall into the sign trap, assuming a negative remains negative.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=20% C=2% D=3%
*These students are fluent in expanding brackets (FOIL/Grid method) and generally remember their sign rules, though some will still make a careless "sign slip" under exam pressure.*

**advanced:** A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
*Advanced students will identify the "Last" term multiplication instantly. Errors here are rare and usually down to extreme haste rather than lack of knowledge.*
