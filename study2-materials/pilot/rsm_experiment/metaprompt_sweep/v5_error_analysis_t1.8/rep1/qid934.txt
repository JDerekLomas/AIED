In this Year 9 mock, students frequently struggle with equations where $y$ is not the subject. Many default to "pattern matching" rather than substitution.

*   **Option C (5)** is the correct answer: When $x=0$, $2y=10$, so $y=5$.
*   **Option B (3)** is the "slope/gradient trap": Students calculate the value for $x=1$ ($2y = 6 \implies y=3$) or apply a perceived sequence. 
*   **Option D (2.5)** is the "misplaced division" error: Students see the numbers 10 and 4 and perform $10 \div 4$.
*   **Option A (20)** is the "multiplication trap": Students multiply $4 \times 5$ (incorrectly linking $4x$ and $10$) or misinterpret the relationship entirely.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=40% D=20%
proficient: A=2% B=13% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=97% D=1%
