Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on typical Year 9 mock exam performance and common misconceptions regarding BIDMAS/BODMAS.

**Teacher's Reflection on the Traps:**
*   **The 'Addition over Subtraction' Fallacy:** In Problem P, many students (even at proficient levels) mistakenly believe the "A" in BIDMAS must always come before the "S". They hunt for the `+` sign and calculate $5+6$ first, ignoring the rule that addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be performed left-to-right.
*   **The Left-to-Right Habit:** In Problem Q, lower-ability students instinctively work from left to right as if reading a sentence. This makes $4+5$ an "attractive" error.
*   **The Catch:** Only the advanced students consistently remember that addition/subtraction are peer operations while multiplication takes absolute precedence.

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=40% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=35% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=55% C=15% D=20%
advanced: A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%
