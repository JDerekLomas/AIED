In this context, I am evaluating the expansion of a quadratic where the primary difficulty lies in the manipulation of negative signs.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option B (Correct):** Requires correctly calculating $-5 + -7 = -12$ and $-5 \times -7 = +35$.
*   **Option D (The "Sign Slip"):** This is the most common error. Students correctly sum to $-12$ but intuitively think "a negative times a negative is a negative" when rushing, or they correctly see $5 \times 7 = 35$ and simply bring down the minus sign from the bracket.
*   **Option A (The "Difference" Error):** Students find the difference between 7 and 5 instead of the sum. This often happens with students who are confused about the FOIL/Grid method and just "combine" the numbers they see.
*   **Option C (The "Ignore the signs" Error):** Lower ability students often treat all terms as positive, then realize the question has minus signs and second-guess themselves, but many still land here by ignoring the Directed Number rules entirely.

**Predicted Distributions:**

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=94% C=1% D=3%
