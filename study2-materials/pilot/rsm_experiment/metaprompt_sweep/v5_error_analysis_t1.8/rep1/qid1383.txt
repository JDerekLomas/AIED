Based on marking hundreds of these papers, here is the breakdown of how Year 9 students typically handle negative bases and exponents.

**The "Thinking" behind the numbers:**
*   **The Index vs. Multiplier Error:** Lower-ability students almost reflexively do $3 \times 4$ instead of $3^4$, leading to B and D.
*   **The Sign Error (The most "attractive" trap):** Students who know the calculation is $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$ often fail to track the sign. Many associate "negative number in" with "negative answer out."
*   **Calculator Misuse:** Even with a calculator, many students type $-3^4$ instead of $(-3)^4$, which gives $-81$ (C). Only the "advanced" students consistently remember to use brackets.
