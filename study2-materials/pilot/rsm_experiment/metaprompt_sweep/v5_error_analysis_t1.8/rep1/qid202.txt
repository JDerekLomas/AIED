Having marked hundreds of these scripts, this is a classic "read the full instruction" question. While the addition itself is straightforward, the primary trap here is not the calculation, but the requested format and the temptation to add the denominators.

**Common Errors & Thinking Patterns:**
*   **A (Correct):** Students who realize they can simply add the whole numbers and then the fractions. Proficient and Advanced students do this instantly.
*   **B (Incorrect Format):** This is the most "attractive" distractor for high-ability students who have been drilled to convert to improper fractions as a "default" method for all fraction work. They calculate $11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$ and stop, failing to convert back to a mixed number as requested.
*   **C (Basic Fraction Error):** Adding both numerators and denominators ($3/10$). This is the hallmark of a student who lacks conceptual understanding of the "whole" in fractions.
*   **D (Denominator Trap):** Students who add the whole numbers correctly but still fall into the trap of adding the denominators ($1/5 + 2/5 = 3/10$).

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=7% C=0% D=1%
