In my experience marking this specific order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) question, the primary pitfall is the "Left-to-Right" trap. Students who lack a firm grasp of hierarchy simply process numbers as they read them, leading them to think both sides equal 5. 

**Calculations & Traps:**
*   **Left Side (Correct):** $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = \mathbf{11}$.
*   **Left Side (Error):** $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.
*   **Right Side:** $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.

**The Distribution:**
*   **A ($>$):** Correct. Requires applying BIDMAS to the left side and comparing.
*   **C ($=$):** The most common error. Students ignore BIDMAS on the left or assume the brackets on the right don't change the outcome of those specific numbers.
*   **B ($<$):** Less common, usually resulting from a mental arithmetic error (e.g., $12 \div 4 = 2$ or $8 + 3 = 10$ vs $20 \div 4 = 5$).
*   **D ($\geq$):** Generally chosen by students who are guessing or overthinking the presence of an inequality they rarely use.
