To simplify $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator, which is $2x$. This requires multiplying the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$, resulting in $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

**Teacher's Analysis of Distractors:**
*   **A (Correct):** Requires recognizing the need for a common denominator and correctly multiplying the numerator of the second term.
*   **B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** The most common error for lower-ability students. They "add across" (3+4 and 2x+x). It feels natural because it mirrors the addition of integers.
*   **C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** The student knows to multiply the 4 by 2, but incorrectly "cancels" or forgets the denominator of the first term, or simply ignores the coefficient in the final answer.
*   **D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** A very "attractive" trap for middle-ability students. They recognize $2x$ is the common denominator, but they forget to multiply the numerator of the second fraction (leaving it as $3+4$ instead of $3+8$).
