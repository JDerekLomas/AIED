As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because it tests two distinct areas of potential misconception: the handling of zero in statistics and the understanding of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) Correct Reasoning:** This student understands that to find the mean, you sum all values and divide by the total count ($n=5$). Crucially, they recognise that adding 0 does not change the numerator but that the 0 **must** be counted as a data point in the denominator.
*   **B) Operational Misconception (BIDMAS):** This student understands the concept of the mean (add them up and divide by how many there are) but does not understand how a calculator or formal notation handles the hierarchy of operations. Without brackets, only the 7 is divided by 5 ($0+1+3+4+(7 \div 5)$).
*   **C) Statistical Misconception (The "Zero isn't a number" error):** This is a very common mistake. The student ignores the zero entirely, both in the sum and in the count, treating the data set as having only four values.
*   **D) Calculation/Definition Error:** This student might think that the 0 *must* be explicitly written in the numerator for it to be "correct," or they may have miscalculated the sum or count and concluded none are right.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, these distributions reflect students ranging from Low Ability (below_basic) to High Ability (advanced) in Year 7–9 (ages 11–14).

**below_basic**
*These students often struggle with the concept of "nothing" as a value and lack an understanding of mathematical priority (BIDMAS).*
A=20% B=40% C=35% D=5%

**basic**
*Students at this level know how to "do" a mean but are highly susceptible to the "zero isn't a value" trap. They often select C because it feels more intuitive to only count the "actual" numbers.*
A=35% B=20% C=40% D=5%

**proficient**
*These students have been warned about the zero trap. They understand that $n=5$. They are less likely to choose B because they recognise the expression looks "wrong" for a calculator.*
A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%

**advanced**
*These students quickly identify that adding 0 doesn't change the sum and correctly identify that $n=5$. They are very sensitive to BIDMAS errors and will spot that B is incorrect.*
A=95% B=1% C=2% D=2%
