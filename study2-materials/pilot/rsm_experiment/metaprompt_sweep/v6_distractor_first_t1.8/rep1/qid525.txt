As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen this specific type of question reveal common misconceptions regarding fraction operations, specifically the "add the tops, add the bottoms" error and the failure to read final instructions.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

**A) $\frac{99}{20}$**
The student has calculated the answer correctly by finding a common denominator (e.g., $2\frac{14}{20} + 2\frac{5}{20} = 4\frac{19}{20}$) and then correctly converting it to an improper fraction ($[4 \times 20] + 19 = 99$). However, they have failed to follow the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number."

**B) $4 \frac{19}{20}$ (Correct Answer)**
The student has correctly identified a common denominator (20), converted the fractional parts ($7/10 = 14/20$ and $1/4 = 5/20$), added the whole numbers $(2+2=4)$ and the numerators $(14+5=19)$, and presented the result in the requested format.

**C) $\frac{99}{40}$**
The student likely converted both numbers to improper fractions first ($27/10$ and $9/4$). While attempting to find a common denominator, they may have multiplied the numerators by the wrong values or, more commonly, simply multiplied the denominators $(10 \times 4 = 40)$ but failed to scale the numerators correctly, or simply made a computational error in an attempt to reach 99 while picking a plausible-looking denominator.

**D) $4 \frac{8}{14}$**
This is a classic "below basic" error. The student has added the whole numbers $(2+2=4)$, then added the numerators $(7+1=8)$ and added the denominators $(10+4=14)$. This demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of the requirement for a common denominator.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

**Below Basic**
*These students struggle with the concept of equivalence and usually apply "additive" logic to all parts of the number.*
A=5% B=15% C=10% D=70%

**Basic**
*These students know they need a common denominator but often make arithmetic errors or default to the easiest visual pattern. Some may correctly calculate the value but be distracted by the improper fraction.*
A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%

**Proficient**
*These students understand the algorithm well. The main pitfalls here are the "improper fraction" trap and occasional minor arithmetic slips.*
A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%

**Advanced**
*These students read the full question, including the formatting constraint, and have high computational accuracy.*
A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
