As a UK maths teacher, I approach this question by considering how students apply (or misapply) BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction).

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

**A) $6$ (Correct)**
The student correctly follows the order of operations: they multiply first ($4 \times 2 = 8$), then work left-to-right through addition and subtraction ($3 - 5 = -2$, and $-2 + 8 = 6$). This requires a solid grasp of both BIDMAS and negative number arithmetic.

**B) $4$ (MISCONCEPTION: Rigid BIDMAS)**
The student follows BIDMAS but interprets "Addition before Subtraction" as a rigid rule rather than as operations of equal priority. They calculate $5 + (4 \times 2)$, which is $5 + 8 = 13$, and then do $3 - 13 = -10$ (Wait—actually, to get 4, they often do $3 - 5 = -2$ then $4 \times 2 = 8$ and somehow conclude $8 - 2 - 2$ or similar errors). 
**Correction:** The primary route to $4$ is calculating $(3 - 5) + 4$ first to get $2$, then multiplying by $2$: $(3-5+4) \times 2 = (2) \times 2 = 4$. This is a "Left-to-Right" error ignoring the priority of multiplication.

**C) $-12$ (MISCONCEPTION: Left-to-Right + Sign error)**
The student ignores BIDMAS and goes left-to-right. They calculate $3 - 5 = -2$. They then add $4$ to get $+2$. Then they multiply by $2$. This results in $4$ (Option B). To get $-12$, they usually do $3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 = 3 - (9 \times 2) = 3 - 18 = -15$, or they process it as $(3 - 5 + 4) \times 2$ but make a calculation error with negative numbers.

**D) $-10$ (MISCONCEPTION: Addition over Subtraction Priority)**
The student follows the order of operations but treats Addition as strictly before Subtraction. They multiply first: $4 \times 2 = 8$. They then see $-5 + 8$ but mistakenly add the absolute values or process the subtraction last as $3 - (5 + 8) = 3 - 13 = -10$. This is a very common high-frequency error in UK secondary schools.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions:

**Below Basic:** (Year 7/8 students or those struggling with basic numeracy). They almost always work strictly left-to-right or get confused by the negative.
A=15% B=45% C=20% D=20%

**Basic:** (Students who know the word "BIDMAS" but apply it too literally or struggle with negative directed numbers).
A=35% B=20% C=10% D=35%

**Proficient:** (GCSE Foundation/Higher crossover students. They know to multiply first but may still fall into the $3 - 13$ trap).
A=70% B=5% C=5% D=20%

**Advanced:** (GCSE Higher Level/A-Level students. Expected to handle both the hierarchy of operations and directed numbers fluently).
A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
