As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in Foundation and Higher GCSE tiers. It tests the conceptual understanding of variables in the denominator—a common "threshold concept" where many students stumble.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) \( p=0.5 \)**: **[Correct Reasoning]** The student correctly multiplies both sides by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, then divides by 10 to get $p = 5/10$, which simplifies to $0.5$. Alternatively, they use "substitution" or "logic," recognizing that 5 divided by a half is 10.
*   **B) \( p=50 \)**: **[Misconception: Inverse Operations]** The student sees the 10 and the 5 and assumes they must multiply them because there is a division sign in the problem. They incorrectly perform $10 \times 5 = 50$, ignoring the algebraic structure (essentially treating the problem as $p = 10 \times 5$).
*   **C) \( p=2 \)**: **[Misconception: Commutative Property of Division]** This is the most common error. The student thinks that $\frac{5}{p}$ is the same as $\frac{p}{5}$. They solve $10 = \frac{p}{5}$ by multiplying 10 by 5, or more simply, they just perform $10 \div 5$ because they are conditioned to divide the larger number by the smaller number.
*   **D) There are no solutions**: **[Misconception: Integer Bias]** Some students believe that because 5 is smaller than 10, dividing 5 by something "can't make it bigger" (forgetting that dividing by a decimal/fraction results in a larger quotient). If they cannot see an immediate integer solution, they assume it is impossible.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions:

I have categorised these based on the standard UK GCSE expectations (below_basic corresponds to Grade 1-2, basic to Grade 3-4, proficient to Grade 5-6, and advanced to Grade 7-9).

**below_basic:** A=10% B=30% C=50% D=10%
*At this level, "Big number divided by Small number" (Option C) is the dominant instinctive reaction.*

**basic:** A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%
*Students here are starting to use algebra but often flip the fraction or divide in the wrong direction out of habit. $10 \div 5 = 2$ remains a very "sticky" distractor.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
*Most students at this level understand that the variable in the denominator requires two steps (multiply by $p$, then divide). Only a few make the "quick" error of choosing $p=2$.*

**advanced:** A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%
*At this level, the operation is automated. Errors are usually due to extreme rushing rather than lack of conceptual understanding.*
