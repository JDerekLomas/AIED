As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have encountered this specific type of linear equation many times. This question tests a student's ability to manipulate fractions and apply inverse operations, specifically dividing a unit fraction by an integer.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning for each option:

**A) $p = \frac{1}{4}$**
This is a very common "visual" error. The student sees the 3 and the 12 and immediately thinks of the relationship $12 \div 3 = 4$. They essentially ignore the fractional nature of the RHS and perform $p = 12 \div 3$, but keep it as a fraction because the original term was a fraction.

**B) $p = \frac{1}{36}$ (Correct Reasoning)**
The student correctly applies the inverse operation. To solve for $p$, they must divide both sides by 3. 
$p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 \Rightarrow p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$. This demonstrates an understanding of both algebraic balance and fraction multiplication.

**C) $p = 4$**
This is a "cross-multiplication" or "reciprocal" error. The student often tries to move the 3 by multiplying it by the 12, or they solve $3p = 12$ by mistake, ignoring the $1/$. It represents a total breakdown in the understanding of the equation's structure.

**D) $p = \frac{1}{9}$**
The student incorrectly subtracts 3 from 12 instead of dividing. They see the 3 on the left and the 12 on the right and assume $12 - 3 = 9$, placing it back into the denominator. This is typical of students who have a "magic moving" approach to algebra rather than inverse operations.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

I have categorised the "ability levels" based on the typical UK GCSE performance (Below Basic: Grade 1-2, Basic: Grade 3-4, Proficient: Grade 5-7, Advanced: Grade 8-9).

*   **below_basic:** A=40% B=15% C=30% D=15%
    *(Students at this level are heavily guided by "nice" numbers, leading them to see 3 and 12 and instinctively choose 4 or 1/4.)*
*   **basic:** A=35% B=40% C=10% D=15%
    *(Students here are beginning to use inverse operations but often struggle with the "fraction divided by a whole number" mechanic, frequently defaulting to A.)*
*   **proficient:** A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
    *(The majority of these students will handle the fraction correctly, though a few will make a "mental lapse" and choose A via quick, unchecked division.)*
*   **advanced:** A=2% B=97% C=0% D=1%
    *(At this level, the operation is reflexive. Errors, if any, are usually due to extreme haste.)*
