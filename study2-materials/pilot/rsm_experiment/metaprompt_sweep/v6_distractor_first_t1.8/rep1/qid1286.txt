As a UK maths teacher, I would approach this question by evaluating the students' fluency with both the geometric formula for the volume of a sphere ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) and their algebraic skills in rearranging formulae.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning for each option:

*   **A) $\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}}$**: The student incorrectly manipulates the fraction. Instead of multiplying by 3 and dividing by $4\pi$, they likely multiplied by the coefficient $\frac{4}{3}\pi$ wholesale or failed to recognize that $4$ and $\pi$ are in the numerator of the original formula.
*   **B) $\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}}$**: The student has a "partial" understanding of the rearrangement. They correctly moved $\pi$ to the denominator but failed to invert the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ correctly, keeping the $4$ on top and $3$ on the bottom during the transfer.
*   **C) $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}}$**: **Correct Reasoning.** Starting with $V = \frac{4\pi r^3}{3}$, the student multiplies by 3 ($3V = 4\pi r^3$), divides by $4\pi$ ($\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$), and takes the cube root of the entire expression.
*   **D) $\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi}$**: This student likely performed the algebraic steps in the wrong order or applied the cube root only to $V$. They treat the coefficients $3, 4,$ and $\pi$ as outside the radical, which is a common error for students who struggle with the priority of operations in surds.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions:

**Below Basic**
*Likely students working at GCSE Grade 3 or below. They often guess or struggle with the volume formula itself.*
A=30% B=25% C=15% D=30%

**Basic**
*Likely students at GCSE Grade 4-5. They know the formula but often make "one-step" errors in rearrangement.*
A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%

**Proficient**
*Likely students at GCSE Grade 6-7. These students are comfortable with algebraic manipulation but can be tripped up by the placement of $\pi$.*
A=10% B=15% C=65% D=10%

**Advanced**
*Likely students at GCSE Grade 8-9 or A-Level. They should identify the correct rearrangement instantly.*
A=2% B=3% C=93% D=2%
