As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in Foundation and Higher GCSE papers. It tests two distinct concepts: index notation (powers) and the rules for multiplying directed numbers (negatives).

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) 81 (Correct Reasoning):** The student correctly identifies that $(-3)^4$ means $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$. They know that $3^4 = 81$ and that an even number of negative signs results in a positive product (minus $\times$ minus = plus).
*   **B) 12 (Multiplication Error):** The student confuses powers with multiplication ($k \times 4$). They have calculated $(-3) \times 4$. They often drop the negative sign or ignore it, arriving at $12$.
*   **C) -81 (Sign Error):** This is the most common high-level error. The student understands that $3^4 = 81$ but incorrectly assumes that because the base is negative, the result must be negative. They fail to realise that the negative signs cancel out in pairs. This is also the result they would get if they typed $-3^4$ into a scientific calculator without using brackets.
*   **D) -12 (Linear and Sign Error):** Like option B, the student has multiplied the base by the index ($k \times 4$). However, they have retained the negative sign from the base: $(-3) \times 4 = -12$.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK system, **Below Basic** refers to students struggling with Level 1-2 (low Foundation), **Basic** to Levels 3-4 (Standard Pass), **Proficient** to Levels 5-6 (Strong Pass/Higher entry), and **Advanced** to Levels 7-9.

| Ability Level | A (81) | B (12) | C (-81) | D (-12) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 35% | 15% | 35% |
| **Basic** | 40% | 10% | 35% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 75% | 5% | 18% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 0% | 2% | 0% |

#### Teacher’s Analysis of the Distribution:
*   **Below Basic:** These students almost exclusively treat powers as multiplication. They are split between options B and D based on whether they remember to include the minus sign in a linear calculation.
*   **Basic:** These students usually know that $3^4$ is $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$, but the "negative base" rule is a major stumbling block. A significant portion will choose C because "it starts with a minus, so it ends with a minus."
*   **Proficient:** Most will get this right, but a notable group will fall into the "Calculator Trap" (Option C). They understand the math but rely on technology, typing `- 3 ^ 4` instead of `( - 3 ) ^ 4`, and trust the output.
*   **Advanced:** At this level, students have internalised that even powers yield positive results. Errors here are extremely rare and usually down to simple arithmetic slips rather than conceptual misunderstanding.
