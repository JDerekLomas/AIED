As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently in GCSE Foundation and Higher tier papers. It tests the ability to find a common denominator involving algebraic terms.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) Correct Reasoning:** To add $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a common denominator of $2x$ is required. The student multiplies the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$ to get $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}$. Adding the numerators ($3+8$) gives $11$, and the denominator remains $2x$.
*   **B) Adding everything:** The student adds the numerators ($3+4=7$) and adds the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). This is a very common misconception where students treat fractions like whole numbers or fail to understand the requirement for a common denominator.
*   **C) Incorrect common denominator (Ignoring the 2):** The student attempts to find a common denominator but decides it is simply $x$. They keep the $3$ (forgetting it was over $2x$) and double the $4$ to get $8$, or they simply multiply $3+8$ but place it over the "simpler" looking denominator $x$. Alternatively, they might do $\frac{3+2(4)}{x}$.
*   **D) Adding numerators only:** The student identifies $2x$ as the common denominator but forgets to scale the numerator of the second fraction. They simply calculate $3+4$ over the denominator $2x$.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK system, **Below Basic** refers to students struggling with basic fraction arithmetic (Year 9/Grade 4 targets). **Basic** refers to students at a low GCSE Pass level (Grade 4/5). **Proficient** corresponds to students aiming for Grades 6/7, and **Advanced** refers to those aiming for Grades 8/9.

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Add all) | C (Partial Error) | D (Half-scale) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 55% | 15% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 20% | 10% | 25% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 5% | 2% | 8% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0% | 1% |

**Teacher's Note:** Option B is the "honey trap" for students who view algebra as a set of rules they don't quite remember. Option D is the most frustrating error for teachers, as it shows the student knew how to find the common denominator but forgot the "golden rule" of equivalent fractions (whatever you do to the bottom, you must do to the top).
