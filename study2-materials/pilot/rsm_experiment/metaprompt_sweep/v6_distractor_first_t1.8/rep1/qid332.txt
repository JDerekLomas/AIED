As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of two-step equation question frequently in GCSE Foundation and higher-tier Key Stage 3 assessments. It tests "Order of Operations" in reverse and the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) Only Tom:** The student recognizes that the inverse of subtracting 5 is adding 5 to both sides ($12 + 5 = 17$). This is the standard "first step" taught in UK schools (isolating the term with $x$).
*   **B) Only Katie:** The student mistakenly thinks you can multiply only the fraction and the answer by 3, while forgetting to multiply the $-5$. This is a very common procedural error when trying to "clear the fraction" prematurely.
*   **C) Both Tom and Katie:** The student correctly identifies Tom’s step but falls into the trap of thinking Katie’s step is also valid. They likely think that because $12 \times 3 = 36$ and the $x$ is now "free," the operation is correct, failing to realize that every term in the equation must be multiplied by 3 (Katie's line should have been $x - 15 = 36$ to be correct).
*   **D) Neither is correct:** The student likely lacks a solid grasp of inverse operations or has made a mental arithmetic error (e.g., thinking Tom should have subtracted 5 instead of adding it).

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, **Below Basic** refers to students working significantly below age-related expectations (Level 1-2). **Basic** refers to those aiming for a GCSE Grade 3. **Proficient** refers to GCSE Grade 5-6, and **Advanced** refers to those aiming for Grade 7-9.

**below_basic:** A=30% B=25% C=30% D=15%
*Students at this level often guess or pick C because they assume "Both" sounds like the most sophisticated answer in a math discussion.*

**basic:** A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%
*These students usually recognise Tom's step as the "standard" way they were taught, but a high number are still tempted by Katie’s logic because they struggle with the requirement to multiply 'all' terms.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
*The majority correctly identify Tom's addition. The common mistake here is still Option C, as the "multiplication trap" is one of the most persistent misconceptions in algebra.*

**advanced:** A=94% B=1% C=5% D=0%
*High-ability students immediately see that Katie failed to multiply the constant term (-5). A tiny fraction might overthink the question or misread Katie's line, but nearly all will correctly choose A.*
