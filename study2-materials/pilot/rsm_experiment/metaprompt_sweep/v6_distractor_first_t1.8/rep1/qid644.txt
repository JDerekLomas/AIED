As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in GCSE Foundation and higher-tier revision. This question tests two distinct skills: understanding which operation to perform when expanding brackets (multiplication vs. addition) and the application of directed number rules (negative $\times$ negative).

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) +4:** This is the **correct** answer. The student identifies that "expanding" means multiplying the terms. They correctly multiply $-1$ by $-4$. They apply the rule that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive.
*   **B) -4:** The student correctly identifies that they need to multiply $(-1 \times 4)$, but they either forget to include the sign of the second term or have a misconception that "a negative and a negative stay negative" regardless of the operation.
*   **C) +5:** The student understands that two negatives make a positive (or ignores the signs), but they have performed **addition** rather than multiplication ($1 + 4 = 5$). This is a common "cognitive overload" error where the brain reverts to simpler operations while focusing on sign rules.
*   **D) -5:** The student has performed **addition** and applied the rules of adding directed numbers $(-1 + -4 = -5)$. They have misunderstood the instruction to "expand" (which implies multiplication) or are confusing the process with simplifying terms.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK context, these ability levels correspond roughly to: 
*   **Below Basic:** Working towards Grade 1-2.
*   **Basic:** Grade 3 level (targeting a Pass).
*   **Proficient:** Grade 4-5 (Solid GCSE Pass).
*   **Advanced:** Grade 6-9.

| Ability Level | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 35% | 15% | 35% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 25% | 10% | 20% |
| **Proficient** | 82% | 10% | 3% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0.5% | 0.5% |

**Teacher's Note on the Data:**
At the **Below Basic** level, the most common error is D, as students often view any two numbers next to each other as an addition/subtraction problem. At the **Basic** level, the "negative times negative" rule is the most common pitfall, leading many to select B. Once students reach **Proficient**, they rarely add the numbers, but a small percentage will still make a "slips-and-trips" sign error (Option B).
