As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this type of substitution and algebraic manipulation question frequently in Foundation and Higher GCSE tiers. The complexity here lies in the fact that the equation is implicit ($4x + 2y = 10$) rather than explicit ($y = ...$), which often trips up students who rely on rote patterns.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) 20:** This is a classic "operation scramble." The student likely takes the coefficient of $x$ (4) and the constant (5 or 10) and performs an incorrect operation, such as $4 \times 5$. Alternatively, they might see $x=0$, ignore the $2y$ and $10$, and somehow involve $4 \times 5 = 20$ from looking ahead at other potential values.
*   **B) 3:** This comes from a common misinterpretation of the relationship between $x$ and $y$. A student might solve $4x + 2y = 10$ correctly for $x=1$ (yielding $y=3$) instead of $x=0$. They skip the first column because "zero is nothing" and provide the value for the first "active" number.
*   **C) 5:** **Correct Reasoning.** The student substitutes $x = 0$ into the equation: $4(0) + 2y = 10$. This simplifies to $2y = 10$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $y = 5$.
*   **D) 2.5:** This error stems from dividing the constant by the wrong coefficient. The student likely simplifies the equation to $y = 10/4$ because they are conditioned to see the first number in the equation as the "divider" or they confuse the coefficients of $x$ and $y$.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

I have categorized these by GCSE-aligned ability levels (Below Basic = Grade 1-2, Basic = Grade 3, Proficient = Grade 4-6, Advanced = Grade 7-9).

**below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%**
*At this level, students often guess based on the numbers they see in the question. Many will choose 2.5 because they know division is involved but pick the wrong numbers to divide. C is slightly higher only because some might recognize that "half of ten is five."*

**basic: A=10% B=25% C=45% D=20%**
*Basic students often solve for $x=1$ by mistake (Option B) or get confused by the 4 and 2, leading to D. However, the majority will correctly identify that if $x=0$, $2y=10$, and find 5.*

**proficient: A=2% B=8% C=80% D=10%**
*Proficient students are comfortable with substitution. Most will get this right instantly. The few errors will be "careless," such as picking 3 because they looked at the wrong column or picking 2.5 due to a processing error during division.*

**advanced: A=0% B=2% C=97% D=1%**
*Advanced students will see the $4(0)$ as zero immediately. The only errors here would be visual slips (looking at the wrong row or column), which are very rare for this level of difficulty.*
