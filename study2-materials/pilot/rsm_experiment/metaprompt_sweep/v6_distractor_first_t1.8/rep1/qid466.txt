As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently when testing students' understanding of **multiplicative inverses** and **integer signs**. The key hurdles here are twofold: knowing that the product of reciprocals is 1, and applying the "negative × positive = negative" rule.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) Correct Reasoning:** To get a result of $-1$ from a starting point of $-\frac{3}{4}$, the student recognizes they need the **reciprocal** ($\frac{4}{3}$) but must keep it **positive** because $(\text{negative}) \times (\text{positive}) = \text{negative}$.
*   **B) Sign Error:** The student correctly identifies the need for the reciprocal ($\frac{4}{3}$) but incorrectly applies the rule for multiplying negatives. They likely think "to get a negative answer, I need a negative number," forgetting that $(-) \times (-) = (+)$.
*   **C) Concept Confusion:** The student ignores the fraction inversion entirely and simply changes the sign. They are confusing the rule for the **additive inverse** (where $-\frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = 0$) with the multiplicative inverse.
*   **D) Misunderstanding Identity:** The student may think that multiplying a number by itself results in 1 (or -1), or they are simply overwhelmed by the notation and choose the value already present in the question.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK curriculum, **"Below Basic"** corresponds to students struggling at KS3 (Level 3-4), **"Basic"** to Grade 3-4 at GCSE, **"Proficient"** to Grade 6, and **"Advanced"** to Grade 8-9.

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Sign Error) | C (Additive) | D (Identity) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 35% | 25% | 25% |
| **Basic** | 40% | 40% | 10% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 75% | 20% | 3% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 95% | 4% | 1% | 0% |

#### Teacher’s Analysis of the Distribution:
*   **Below Basic:** These students often "guess" based on the numbers they see. They see $-\frac{3}{4}$ and $-1$ and assume the answer must also be a fraction with 3s and 4s. They have a high tendency to choose negative numbers when the target is negative.
*   **Basic:** This group usually knows that "flipping the fraction" is required to get to the number 1, but they consistently trip up on the signs. They often mistakenly believe that "to get a negative answer, the multiplier must be negative."
*   **Proficient:** These students generally understand the reciprocal rule. The 20% choosing **B** represents those making a "performance error" under timed conditions—recognising the reciprocal but failing to double-check the sign product.
*   **Advanced:** Almost all students at this level will instantly recognize that $\frac{x}{y} \times \frac{y}{x} = 1$ and correctly adjust the sign to ensure the product remains $-1$.
