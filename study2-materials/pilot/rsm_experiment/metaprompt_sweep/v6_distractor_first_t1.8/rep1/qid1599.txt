As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently when introducing Key Stage 3 students to the formal notations of algebra. This question tests the understanding that a fraction bar represents a division of the *entire* numerator by the *entire* denominator.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) Correct reasoning:** The student understands that in algebra, $x \div y$ is expressed as $\frac{x}{y}$. They correctly identify $(h+4)$ as the divisor, meaning it must form the entire denominator, and $c$ as the dividend, making it the numerator.
*   **B) Over-complication / Misinterpretation:** The student likely feels that because there is a "+4" on one side, there should be symmetry in the algebraic expression, or they have misread the question and assumed both terms involve a $+4$.
*   **C) Incorrect Order of Operations / Formatting:** The student fails to recognize the parentheses in the original expression. They have essentially translated $c \div h + 4$ rather than $c \div (h+4)$, performing the division first and then adding the constant separately.
*   **D) Reverse Division:** The student understands the fraction bar represents division but lacks the conceptual clarity on "numerator" vs "denominator" (Dividend vs Divisor). They have written $(h+4) \div c$ instead.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, **"Below Basic"** corresponds to students struggling with Level 3/4 concepts; **"Basic"** represents those achieving a "Developing" or Low GCSE Grade 3; **"Proficient"** represents those on track for a Grade 5/6; and **"Advanced"** represents those aiming for Grade 7-9.

| Ability Level | A (%) | B (%) | C (%) | D (%) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **below_basic** | 25% | 15% | 35% | 25% |
| **basic** | 55% | 5% | 20% | 20% |
| **proficient** | 85% | 2% | 8% | 5% |
| **advanced** | 98% | 0% | 1% | 1% |

**Teacher Commentary on the data:**
*   **Below Basic:** At this level, many students view the options as "vaguely mathematical patterns" rather than logical structures. Option C is a very common distractor here because it looks like a direct left-to-right translation of the symbols.
*   **Basic:** The majority get this right, but a significant portion will still struggle with the "direction" of the division (choosing D) or neglect the significance of the brackets (choosing C).
*   **Proficient:** These students have moved past the "division sign" and see the fraction bar as the standard. The small percentage of errors usually comes from "skimming" and misreading the question.
*   **Advanced:** Mastery is expected. The 1% margins represent rare instances of "slip of the pen" or simple human error.
