As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen this specific "reverse operation" error many times when teaching linear equations.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

*   **A) Only step 1:** The student correctly understands that they must multiply by 4 to remove the denominator ($15 \times 4 = 60$). However, they correctly identify the error in Step 2, noting that the inverse of adding 1 is subtracting 1 (which should result in $k=59$). This is the **correct mathematical analysis**.
*   **B) Only step 2:** This is a rare choice. A student might choose this if they are confused by the layout and believe Step 1 is incorrect because they expected to subtract 1 first (misapplying BIDMAS/BODMAS in reverse), but they somehow believe $60+1=61$ is a valid conclusion for the variable $k$.
*   **C) Both steps are correct:** This is the most common distractor. The student recognizes that Step 1 is correct. In Step 2, they see the "1" and the "60" and instinctively add them because they see an addition sign in the original equation, forgetting to apply the **inverse operation** (subtraction) to solve for $k$.
*   **D) Both steps are incorrect:** The student likely lacks confidence in fractions. They might believe that you should subtract 4 or divide by 15. They fail to see that $15 \times 4 = 60$ is a valid first step.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK system, **Below Basic** refers to students working significantly below age-related expectations (Lower KS3/Foundation Tier), **Basic** refers to those aiming for a Grade 4, **Proficient** refers to those aiming for Grade 6/7, and **Advanced** refers to those aiming for Grade 8/9.

*   **Below_basic:** A=15% B=5% C=60% D=20%
    *   *Reasoning: High "C" selection because they see 60 and 1 and simply follow the + sign to get 61. Many will pick D out of a general "fear" of equations with fractions.*
*   **Basic:** A=40% B=5% C=50% D=5%
    *   *Reasoning: Students at this level are better at the first step (multiplication) but frequently fall into the "positive/negative" or "inverse" trap in the final step.*
*   **Proficient:** A=85% B=2% C=12% D=1%
    *   *Reasoning: Most proficient students will spot the error in Step 2 immediately. The small percentage for C represents those who rush and don't double-check the inverse operation.*
*   **Advanced:** A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%
    *   *Reasoning: Almost all top-tier students will identify that Step 1 is a correct multiplication and Step 2 is an incorrect addition.*
