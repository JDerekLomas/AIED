As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of linear equation problem frequently in GCSE Foundation and Higher tiers. It tests algebraic substitution, rearranging, and basic arithmetic with decimals.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) 3.3 (Correct Reasoning):**
    The student substitutes $y = 0.5$ into the equation: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$. This simplifies to $10x - 3 = 30$. Adding 3 to both sides gives $10x = 33$. Dividing by 10 results in $x = 3.3$.
*   **B) 2.7 (Sign Error / Conceptual Misconception):**
    The student substitutes $y = 0.5$ correctly but makes an error in rearranging the equation. They compute $10x + 3 = 30$ (treating $-6y$ as if the result of the multiplication should be added to the other side without considering the negative sign properly, or effectively subtracting 3 from 30 instead of adding). $10x = 27 \implies x = 2.7$.
*   **C) 4.25 (Inverse Substitution / Calculation Error):**
    This often arises from a student confusing $x$ and $y$ or trying to solve $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$, leading to $5 - 6y = 30 \implies -6y = 25 \implies y \approx -4.16$. However, a common mistake here is adding the 5 and 30 to get 35, then dividing by a misunderstood coefficient, or perhaps computing $30 \div (10 - 3)$ mistakenly. Most commonly, this represents a student who tried to add $10$ and $30$ then divided by decimal parts, a "calculator-mash" approach.
*   **D) -4.25 (Negative Number Confusion):**
    The student reaches $10x = -33$ through multiple sign errors (likely subtracting 3 from 30 then assigning a negative value or failing to handle the $-6y$ correctly when $y$ is positive).

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK system, **Below Basic** equates to students struggling with Level 1-2 at GCSE; **Basic** is Level 3-4 (Foundation); **Proficient** is Level 5-6 (Crossover/Higher); and **Advanced** is Level 7-9 (Higher).

| Ability Level | A (3.3) | B (2.7) | C (4.25) | D (-4.25) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 35% | 25% | 25% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 30% | 15% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 85% | 10% | 3% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0.5% | 0.5% |

**Teacher's Commentary:**
Lower-ability students often struggle with the "negative 6 times 0.5" step. Many see the minus sign and instinctively want to perform a subtraction ($30 - 3$) rather than the inverse operation (adding 3), which makes **Option D (2.7)** the strongest distractor. Students at the "Proficient" level usually have the process correct but may occasionally drop a mark on a silly arithmetic slip. Advanced students will find this a "one-marker" and will rarely drop it.
