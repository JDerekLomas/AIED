As a UK maths teacher, I frequently see these specific misconceptions when teaching BIDMAS (or BODMAS). The conflict between "reading left-to-right" and "hierarchy of operations" is a major stumbling block at Key Stage 3.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) [Reading Left-to-Right only]**
    The student believes that all mathematics is performed strictly from left to right, regardless of the operation. They correctly identify $4-5$ as first in P, but fail to recognise that multiplication takes precedence over addition in Q.
*   **B) [Correct Reasoning]**
    The student understands that in Problem P, Addition and Subtraction have equal priority, so they work left-to-right ($4-5$). They also understand that in Problem Q, Multiplication has higher priority than Addition according to BIDMAS ($5 \times 6$).
*   **C) [Misinterpreting BIDMAS Order & Left-to-Right]**
    This student has a double misconception. In P, they see 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS and mistakenly believe they *must* add before they subtract ($5+6$). However, in Q, they revert to left-to-right scanning ($4+5$), perhaps because the "order" rule hasn't been solidified for mixed operations.
*   **D) [The "Addition before Subtraction" Trap]**
    This is the most common error for intermediate students. They follow BIDMAS literally as a vertical list where 'A' is above 'S', thus choosing $5+6$ first in P. They correctly identify that multiplication comes before addition in Q ($5 \times 6$).

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

**Ability Level Definitions:**
*   **Below Basic:** Struggling with basic number fluency; inconsistent with order of operations.
*   **Basic:** Familiar with the acronym BIDMAS but applies it rigidly/literally.
*   **Proficient:** Understands the equal priority of (+/-) and (×/÷) and applies hierarchy correctly.
*   **Advanced:** Fully fluent; recognizes operations instantly without needing to recite the acronym.

| Ability Level | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **below_basic** | 45% | 15% | 15% | 25% |
| **basic** | 20% | 30% | 5% | 45% |
| **proficient** | 5% | 75% | 0% | 20% |
| **advanced** | 1% | 97% | 0% | 2% |

**Teacher’s Note:** The transition from "Basic" to "Proficient" is where the biggest shift occurs. Most UK students are taught "Addition before Subtraction" as a byproduct of how the BIDMAS acronym is spoken, leading to a high percentage of "D" responses in mid-ability groups. Advanced students have usually been corrected on the "Equal Priority" rule (Left-to-Right for $+$ and $-$).
