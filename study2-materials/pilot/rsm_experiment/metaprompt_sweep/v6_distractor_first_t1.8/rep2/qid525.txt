As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen this specific type of question frequently in GCSE Foundation and Key Stage 3 assessments. The question tests two distinct skills: adding fractions with different denominators and converting between improper fractions and mixed numbers.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

**A) $\frac{99}{20}$**
This answer is mathematically equivalent to the correct sum ($4 \frac{19}{20}$). The student has successfully converted to improper fractions ($\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4}$), found a common denominator of 20 ($\frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20}$), and added them correctly to get $\frac{99}{20}$. However, they have failed to follow the instruction: *"Leave your answer as a mixed number."*

**B) $4 \frac{19}{20}$**
**This is the correct answer.** The student added the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and then correctly added the fractional parts by finding the lowest common multiple of 10 and 4, which is 20 (or 40 and simplifying later). $\frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20}$.

**C) $\frac{99}{40}$**
This represents a partial procedural success marred by a common misconception. The student likely converted to improper fractions correctly ($\frac{27}{10}$ and $\frac{9}{4}$) but when finding a common denominator of 40, they multiplied the numerators by the "other" denominator but then forgot to adjust one or mistakenly added the denominators. Alternatively, they calculated $\frac{27 \times 4 + 9 \times 10}{40}$ incorrectly.

**D) $4 \frac{8}{14}$**
This is the "Add across" error, the most common misconception in fraction addition. The student added the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), then added the numerators ($7+1=8$) and added the denominators ($10+4=14$).

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, **Below Basic** (Grade 1-2) students almost exclusively add across. **Basic** (Grade 3-4) students know they need a common denominator but often forget to convert back to mixed numbers or make arithmetic slips. **Proficient** (Grade 5-6) students usually get the correct value but may lose a mark on the format. **Advanced** (Grade 7+) students rarely miss the formatting instruction.

**below_basic:** A=5% B=10% C=15% D=70%
*Reasoning: High reliance on "adding across" (Option D). Very few understand common denominators.*

**basic:** A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
*Reasoning: They know how to find a common denominator but often forget the final step of the instruction or fall back on the easy "add across" method when they get stuck.*

**proficient:** A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
*Reasoning: Mastery of the fraction addition process is high, but "A" is a very common trap for these students because they stop once they reach a mathematically correct value.*

**advanced:** A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
*Reasoning: These students read the rubric carefully. The only errors here would be rare "finger-slips" in mental arithmetic.*
