As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this question as a test of two distinct skills: recall of the geometric formula for the volume of a sphere and the algebraic proficiency required to rearrange a formula involving fractions, pi, and powers.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4V\pi}{3}} \)**: This error comes from a misunderstanding of algebraic operations. The student knows they need a cube root but multiplies by both the $4$ and the $\pi$ rather than dividing. This is common among students who struggle with the "inverse operations" concept, assuming everything on the right side of the equals sign stays together when moved.
*   **B) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}} \)**: This error results from a partial misplacement during rearrangement. The student correctly moves the $3$ (multiplies) but incorrectly thinks the $4$ should remain in the numerator. It often stems from the visual "top-heavy" look of the $4\pi$ in the original formula.
*   **C) [Correct Reasoning]**: The student starts with $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. They multiply by $3$ to get $3V = 4\pi r^3$, divide by $4\pi$ to get $\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$, and finally take the cube root. This shows a solid grasp of multi-step subjects of formulae.
*   **D) \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4\pi} \)**: This reasoning reflects a "procedural" error. The student remembers that a cube root and a $3$ and $4$ are involved but applies the cube root only to the $V$ rather than the entire expression. They have also likely performed the multiplication/division steps in the wrong order or without maintaining the fraction's balance.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, this is a Higher Tier GCSE topic (Target Grades 6-9).

*   **below_basic (Working at Grade 3/4):** These students often struggle to remember the sphere formula correctly or get overwhelmed by the $4/3$ fraction. They are likely to guess or pick an answer that looks "complex."
    *   A=35% B=30% C=15% D=20%

*   **basic (Working at Grade 5/6):** These students know the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ but often make a single mistake in the three-step rearrangement, frequently with the position of $\pi$ or the $4$.
    *   A=20% B=25% C=40% D=15%

*   **proficient (Working at Grade 7/8):** Most of these students will successfully rearrange the formula. Errors usually only occur through "slipping" (e.g., swapping the $3$ and $4$ due to haste).
    *   A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%

*   **advanced (Working at Grade 9/Further Maths):** These students treat this as a "one-look" question. They have internalized the relationship $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$ as a derived formula.
    *   A=1% B=2% C=96% D=1%
