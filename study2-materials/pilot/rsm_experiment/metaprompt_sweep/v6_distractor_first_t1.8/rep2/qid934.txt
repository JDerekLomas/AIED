As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently when introducing linear equations and substitution. The placement of the star under $x=0$ specifically tests the student's understanding of the $y$-intercept and their ability to handle an equation that is not in the explicit $y=mx+c$ form.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) 20:** This is a "multiplication/operation soup" error. The student sees the numbers 4, 2, and 10 in the equation and assumes they must multiply them (or $2 \times 10$) because they don't know how to handle the variables. Some may also try to "add" all numbers $(4+2+10+4)$ from the table and equation.
*   **B) 3:** This stems from a substitution error into a common linear pattern. A student might incorrectly solve for $x=1$ and get $y=3$ (as $4(1)+2(3)=10$), then mistakenly put that value in the first column, or they might try to find a pattern of "going up in ones" without calculation.
*   **C) 5:** **Correct Reasoning.** The student substitutes $x=0$ into the equation: $4(0) + 2y = 10$. This simplifies to $2y = 10$, and dividing by 2 gives $y = 5$. They understand that when $x=0$, the $x$-term disappears.
*   **D) 2.5:** This is a common algebraic "structure" error. The student likely thinks they need to divide the total (10) by the coefficient of $x$ (4) instead of the coefficient of $y$, or they have confused the roles of $x$ and $y$ and are calculating the $x$-intercept $(y=0, x=2.5)$.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

I have categorized these levels based on typical UK Key Stage 3/4 performance:

*   **Below Basic** (Developing/Entry Level): These students struggle with the concept of substitution and often resort to guessing or basic arithmetic with whatever numbers are visible.
*   **Basic** (GCSE Grade 3-4): These students understand they need to do "something" with the equation but often make mistakes in the order of operations or inverse operations.
*   **Proficient** (GCSE Grade 5-6): These students can substitute $0$ correctly and solve the resulting one-step equation $(2y = 10)$.
*   **Advanced** (GCSE Grade 7-9): These students find this trivial and will likely perform the mental math instantly.

| Ability Level | A | B | C (Correct) | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below basic** | 35% | 20% | 30% | 15% |
| **Basic** | 10% | 15% | 60% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 2% | 3% | 90% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 0% | 0% | 99% | 1% |
