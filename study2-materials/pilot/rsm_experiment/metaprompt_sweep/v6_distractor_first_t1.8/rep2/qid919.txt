As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen these types of misconceptions frequently when students encounter non-linear equations involving decimals. This question specifically tests two things: the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and place value when multiplying decimals.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

**A) 0.81:** This comes from an **incorrect order of operations**. The student calculates $(3x)^2$ instead of $3(x^2)$. They multiply $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, and then square $0.9$ to get $0.81$. This is a very common conceptual error regarding the priority of the exponent.

**B) 0.27: This is the correct answer.** The student correctly identifies the order of operations: square $0.3$ first ($0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$) and then multiply that result by $3$ ($3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$).

**C) 1.8:** This is a **procedural error in squaring**. The student remembers they need to "square" the $x$ but treats squaring as "multiplying by 2". They calculate $0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$ and then multiply by 3 to get $1.8$.

**D) 2.7:** This is a **place value error** (specifically, the "one decimal place" rule). The student correctly identifies that $3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27$, but fails to handle the decimals correctly. They often do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then $0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$, or they square $0.3$ and think it is $0.9$ (ignoring the hundredths place) then multiply by $3$.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

I have categorised the "ability levels" based on Typical UK KS4/GCSE cohorts (Foundation vs Higher).

**Below Basic:** Students at this level often treat indices as "multiplied by 2" or lack an understanding of order of operations. They struggle significantly with decimal multiplication.
**Basic:** Students likely understand they need to do something with $3 \times 3 \times 3$ but frequently make errors in decimal place value (forgetting that $0.3^2 = 0.09$, not $0.9$).
**Proficient:** Students generally know BIDMAS, but are still prone to the "1 dp × 1 dp = 1 dp" place value trap.
**Advanced:** These students consistently apply indices before multiplication and are comfortable with multi-step decimal arithmetic.

| Level | A (Wrong Order) | B (Correct) | C (x2 not ^2) | D (Decimal Error) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 25% | 15% | 40% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 30% | 30% | 10% | 30% |
| **Proficient** | 20% | 60% | 5% | 15% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | 92% | 1% | 2% |
