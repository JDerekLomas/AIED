As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see these two problems as the ultimate test of "The Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS). They highlight the two most common pitfalls: reading strictly left-to-right regardless of operator, and the misconception that Addition must happen before Subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

**A) [Incorrect reasoning: "Strict Left-to-Right"]**
The student processes every calculation exactly as it is written from left to right. They correctly identify $4-5$ as first in Problem P but incorrectly apply the same logic to Problem Q, ignoring that multiplication takes priority over addition.

**B) [Correct reasoning: "Hierarchy and Equality"]**
The student understands that in Problem P, Addition and Subtraction have equal priority, so they work left-to-right ($4-5$ first). In Problem Q, they correctly identify that Multiplication must happen before Addition regardless of position ($5 \times 6$ first).

**C) [Incorrect reasoning: "Literal BIDMAS + Left-to-Right"]**
The student believes that Addition **always** comes before Subtraction because 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym (a very common UK misconception). However, they fail to apply the priority of Multiplication in Problem Q, reverting to left-to-right order there.

**D) [Incorrect reasoning: "Literal BIDMAS"]**
The student strictly follows the letters of the acronym. In Problem P, they pick $5+6$ because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction). In Problem Q, they pick $5 \times 6$ because 'M' (Multiplication) comes before 'A' (Addition). This is a common "sophisticated" error where a student learns the rules but doesn't understand the "equal priority" of + and -.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

**below_basic**
*These students almost always work left-to-right. They rarely apply order of operations consistently.*
A=65% B=15% C=10% D=10%

**basic**
*These students have heard of BIDMAS and often try to apply it literally. This is where we see the highest peak for Option D.*
A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%

**proficient**
*These students know Multiplication comes first, but many still fall into the "Addition before Subtraction" trap for Problem P.*
A=10% B=50% C=5% D=35%

**advanced**
*These students understand that Addition and Subtraction are inverse operations with equal priority and that Multiplication ranks higher.*
A=2% B=90% C=1% D=7%
