As a UK maths teacher, this is a classic "trick" question that tests two distinct conceptual areas: the role of zero in data sets and the importance of Bidmas/Order of Operations.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) [Correct Reasoning]** The student understands that to find the mean, you sum the values ($0+1+3+4+7 = 15$) and divide by the count ($n=5$). They recognize that adding 0 does not change the numerator but that 0 must be counted as an item of data in the denominator.
*   **B) [Procedural/Bidmas Error]** The student knows they need to add the numbers and divide by 5, but they fail to account for the Order of Operations. Written in this linear format, BIDMAS dictates that $7 \div 5$ happens first, leading to the incorrect calculation $0+1+3+4+1.4$.
*   **C) [Conceptual Zero Error]** The student ignores the 0 entirely. They treat "0" as "nothing," thinking it doesn't count as a piece of data. They divide the sum by 4 instead of 5, a common misconception when dealing with "null" values.
*   **D) [Confusion/Over-analysis]** Usually chosen by students who see that A looks "different" (because the 0 isn't explicitly written in the numerator) or students who correctly spot that B is mathematically incorrect due to BIDMAS but fail to see that A is actually correct.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

**Below Basic**
*These students often associate "mean" with "adding and dividing" but lack the technical precision regarding zero and order of operations.*
A=15% B=50% C=30% D=5%

**Basic**
*These students are likely to remember the "sum $\div$ count" rule but frequently fall into the trap of ignoring the 0 in the denominator.*
A=30% B=20% C=45% D=5%

**Proficient**
*Students at this level generally understand that 0 counts as an observation. However, some might still get tripped up by the lack of "0+" in the numerator of Option A, suspecting a trick.*
A=65% B=5% C=20% D=10%

**Advanced**
*Advanced students will recognize that $0+1+3+4+7$ is identical to $1+3+4+7$ and that there are five terms. They will also immediately spot the BIDMAS error in option B.*
A=92% B=1% C=2% D=5%
