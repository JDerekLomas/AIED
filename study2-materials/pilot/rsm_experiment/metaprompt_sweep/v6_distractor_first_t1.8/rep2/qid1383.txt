As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in Foundation and Higher GCSE papers. It tests two distinct concepts: index notation (powers) and the rules for multiplying negative numbers.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) 81 (Correct):** The student correctly identifies that $k^4$ means $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$. They understand that an even number of negative signs results in a positive product, and they correctly calculate $3^4 = 81$.
*   **B) 12:** This is a common "multiplication over power" error. The student has ignored the power rule and simply multiplied the base by the index: $-3 \times 4$, then often discarding the negative sign or mistakenly thinking $k^4$ is $k \times 4$.
*   **C) -81:** This is the most common error among intermediate students. The student correctly calculates $3^4 = 81$ but incorrectly applies the negative sign. This is often reinforced by "calculator error," where typing $-3^4$ into a scientific calculator yields $-81$ because the calculator follows BODMAS/BIDMAS (treating it as $-(3^4)$) unless the student uses brackets.
*   **D) -12:** The student has committed two errors: they multiplied the base by the index ($3 \times 4 = 12$) and retained the negative sign from the base $k$.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK system, **Below Basic** aligns with students working at Grades 1–2, **Basic** at Grade 3, **Proficient** at Grades 4–6, and **Advanced** at Grades 7–9.

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Misconception) | C (Common Error) | D (Misconception) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 35% | 15% | 40% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 15% | 40% | 20% |
| **Proficient** | 65% | 5% | 25% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 95% | 1% | 4% | 0% |

**Teacher Commentary on the Distribution:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level frequently struggle to distinguish between $k \times 4$ and $k^4$. D is the most attractive "distractor" because it involves a simple operation they feel confident in (multiplication).
*   **Basic/Proficient:** This is where **Option C** peaks. These students know how to calculate powers, but they haven't yet mastered the "even power = positive result" rule for negative bases. Many will rely on a calculator but fail to use brackets around the negative number.
*   **Advanced:** Most students at this level recognize the pattern of negative signs ($(-1)^n$ is positive when $n$ is even) and will automatically select A. The few who miss it usually do so through a "calculator slip" rather than a lack of knowledge.
