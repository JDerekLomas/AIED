As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of linear equation mistake frequently. It highlights a student's grasp of "inverse operations" versus their conceptual understanding of how to maintain equality.

### Step 1 — Analysis of Reasoning

*   **A) Only Step 1:** The student correctly identifies that they need to multiply by 4 to "undo" the division ($15 \times 4 = 60$). They then correctly identify that Step 2 is wrong because Isaac added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting it. This is the correct mathematical analysis.
*   **B) Only Step 2:** This is a rare choice. A student might choose this if they mistakenly think Step 1 is wrong (perhaps thinking they should subtract 4 first) but believe that adding 1 to 60 is a valid way to move the constant.
*   **C) Both steps are correct:** This is a common "execution error." The student follows Isaac’s logic superficially: they see $15 \times 4$ is 60 (correct) and then see a "1" and a "60" and think they should be combined. They fail to realise that to isolate $k$, they must subtract 1 from 60 ($k = 59$), not add it. They are likely mimicking the "change the side, change the sign" rule but applying it in reverse.
*   **D) Both steps are incorrect:** The student likely lacks confidence in fraction-based equations. They may believe Isaac should have subtracted 1 before multiplying by 4, failing to recognize that the entire expression $(1+k)$ is being divided by 4.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, **below_basic** refers to students working at Foundation Tier Grade 1–2; **basic** refers to Grade 3–4; **proficient** refers to Grade 5–6 (Higher Tier entry); and **advanced** refers to Grade 7–9.

**below_basic:** A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
*Reasoning:* These students often see a calculation that "looks like maths" and assume it is correct (Choice C). They struggle to verify each step independently.

**basic:** A=45% B=5% C=35% D=15%
*Reasoning:* Many students at this level will spot that $60+1$ shouldn't be $k$, but a significant number still fall into the trap of thinking Isaac's logic in Step 2 follows the pattern of "adding things together."

**proficient:** A=80% B=2% C=15% D=3%
*Reasoning:* These students are generally reliable with two-step equations. The 15% who choose C are likely rushing and didn't notice the $+1$ became a $+61$ instead of a subtraction.

**advanced:** A=96% B=0% C=3% D=1%
*Reasoning:* These students can solve this mentally in seconds. The very small error rate for C and D would be due to misreading the question (e.g., thinking they are being asked "What did Isaac do?" rather than "What is correct?").
