As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently in Foundation and Higher GCSE papers. It tests the ability to find a common denominator in an algebraic context, where a common pitfall is treating the variables and numbers separately or incorrectly "adding across."

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) $\frac{11}{2x}$ (Correct Reasoning):** The student identifies that the lowest common denominator is $2x$. They leave the first fraction as it is and multiply both the numerator and denominator of $\frac{4}{x}$ by 2 to get $\frac{8}{2x}$. They then correctly add the numerators ($3 + 8 = 11$) while keeping the denominator the same.
*   **B) $\frac{7}{3x}$ (Adding Across):** This is a classic "binary" error. The student adds the numerators ($3+4=7$) and adds the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of how fractions work, treating the top and bottom as independent addition problems.
*   **C) $\frac{11}{x}$ (Numerator Error/Partial Common Denominator):** The student correctly works out that the second numerator must become 8, but they perhaps "simplify" the denominator prematurely or get confused, thinking that because $x$ is common to both, the answer should just be over $x$.
*   **D) $\frac{7}{2x}$ (Failing to Adjust Numerator):** The student identifies $2x$ as the common denominator but forgets to scale the numerator of the second fraction. They simply add $3+4$ and put it over $2x$.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, **"Below Basic"** corresponds to students struggling for a Grade 1-2; **"Basic"** to Grade 3-4; **"Proficient"** to Grade 5-6; and **"Advanced"** to Grade 7+.

**below_basic:** A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
*Reasoning: Students at this level almost always "add across" (B). They see a plus sign and apply it to every number they see.*

**basic:** A=35% B=25% C=10% D=30%
*Reasoning: Many students at this level know they need a common denominator, but will frequently choose $2x$ and forget to double the 4, leading them to D. A fair number still default to B when they are rushed.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
*Reasoning: Most students aiming for a Grade 5 or 6 understand the mechanics of algebraic fractions. The most common error remaining is the "lazy" error (D) of not multiplying the second numerator.*

**advanced:** A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
*Reasoning: This is a routine procedural task for a top-end GCSE student. Errors here are usually "slip-of-the-pen" mistakes rather than conceptual misunderstandings.*
