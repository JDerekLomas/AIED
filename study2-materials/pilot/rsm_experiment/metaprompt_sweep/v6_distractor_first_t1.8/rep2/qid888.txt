As a UK maths teacher, I frequently see this specific type of quadratic expansion, usually introduced in Year 9 or Year 10 (KS3/KS4). The signs (negative × negative) are the primary "distractor" elements in this problem.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

**A) \( m^{2}-2 m-35 \)**
This reasoning stems from two distinct errors. First, the student has combined $-7$ and $-5$ by subtraction/finding the difference to get $-2$ instead of adding the two negative values to get $-12$. Second, they have applied "a negative and a negative make a negative" to the multiplication $(-5) \times (-7)$, resulting in $-35$.

**B) \( m^{2}-12 m+35 \) [Correct]**
The student has correctly used FOIL or the Grid Method.
$m \times m = m^2$
$-7m + -5m = -12m$
$-5 \times -7 = +35$

**C) \( m^{2}+12 m+35 \)**
The student correctly knows that two negatives multiplied make a positive $(+35)$, but they have applied that same logic to the addition/linear term. They likely calculated $-5 - 7$ and incorrectly thought "two negatives make a plus," resulting in $+12m$.

**D) \( m^{2}-12 m-35 \)**
The student correctly calculated the linear term $(-12m)$ but failed the integer multiplication rule for the constant term. They saw $-5$ and $-7$ and concluded that the product must be negative $(-35)$, a very common error for students who haven't mastered directed numbers.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions:

I have categorised these based on typical UK secondary school "Working At" levels.

*   **Below Basic** (Students struggling with directed numbers and algebraic notation).
*   **Basic** (Students who know the FOIL/Grid method but are prone to sign errors).
*   **Proficient** (Students comfortable with expanding but occasionally rushing signs).
*   **Advanced** (Students who have mastered quadratic expansion and integer rules).

| Ability Level | A | B (Correct) | C | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 25% | 15% | 30% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 15% | 35% | 20% | 30% |
| **Proficient** | 5% | 75% | 5% | 15% |
| **Advanced** | 1% | 97% | 1% | 1% |

**Teacher Commentary:**
At the **Basic** level, Option D is the most common "trap" because students are often better at adding two negatives to get a larger negative than they are at remembering that multiplying them results in a positive. **Below Basic** students often choose C because they have a vague rule in their head that "two minuses always make a plus," applying it indiscriminately to both the addition and multiplication steps.
