As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in GCSE Foundation and higher-tier introductory algebra. It tests the ability to manipulate fractions when solving one-step equations, a common pitfall area.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) \( p=\frac{1}{4} \)**
    **Reasoning:** The student knows they need to involve the numbers 3 and 12 but chooses the wrong operation (multiplication/division in the wrong direction). They likely performed $12 \div 3 = 4$ and placed it in the denominator, or mistakenly "cancelled" the 3 into the 12 as if the 3 were already in the denominator.
*   **B) \( p=\frac{1}{36} \)**
    **Reasoning (Correct):** To isolate $p$, the student divides both sides by 3. This is equivalent to multiplying the denominator of the right-hand side by 3: $p = \frac{1}{12 \times 3} = \frac{1}{36}$.
*   **C) \( p=4 \)**
    **Reasoning:** This is a classic "number bond" error. The student ignores the fractional nature of the right-hand side entirely and simply calculates $12 \div 3$. They assume $p$ must be a whole number because "3 goes into 12 four times."
*   **D) \( p=\frac{1}{9} \)**
    **Reasoning:** The student correctly identifies that they need to do something with 3 and 12, but performs a subtraction error: $12 - 3 = 9$, then places it back into the fraction format. This is common among students who confuse the rules for additive and multiplicative inverses.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK context, "Below Basic" refers to students working at Grades 1–2; "Basic" at Grade 3; "Proficient" at Grades 4–5; and "Advanced" at Grades 6+.

**below_basic:** A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%
*Reasoning: These students will struggle with the fractional side of the equation. Option C is the most "attractive" because it results in a simple integer they are comfortable with.*

**basic:** A=35% B=25% C=25% D=15%
*Reasoning: Students at this level know they should divide, but they often struggle with dividing a fraction by an integer. Option A is a very common "visual" mistake here (12/3 = 4).*

**proficient:** A=20% B=65% C=10% D=5%
*Reasoning: Most students at this level understand that $3 \times 12$ is the required operation to find the denominator, though a significant minority will still default to the "cleaner" looking answer of 1/4.*

**advanced:** A=5% B=92% C=2% D=1%
*Reasoning: At this level, students treat $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$ as $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$ fluently. Errors here are usually due to rare lapses in concentration.*
