As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen this specific type of multi-step equation confuse students regarding the "order of operations in reverse" (BIDMAS). 

### Step 1 — Analysis of Reasoning

*   **A) Only Tom:** The student recognises that to isolate the $x$ term, the inverse of $-5$ is $+5$. This is the standard first step ($12 + 5 = 17$). They correctly see Tom's method as valid but incorrectly believe Katie’s method is illegal. They likely think you *must* deal with the addition/subtraction before multiplying.
*   **B) Only Katie:** The student understands that to "get rid" of a denominator, you multiply. They correctly multiply $\frac{x}{3}$ by 3 to get $x$ and $12$ by 3 to get $36$. However, they fail to apply the distributive property to the constant ($-5$), forgetting that every term in the equation must be multiplied by 3.
*   **C) Both Tom and Katie:** This is the "lure" for high-achieving students who know there is often more than one way to solve an equation. While Tom is objectively correct, a student choosing C believes Katie’s move is a valid alternative "shortcut" to remove the fraction, overlooking the fundamental rule of maintaining equality across all terms.
*   **D) Neither is correct:** The student likely lacks a conceptual grasp of inverse operations or makes a basic arithmetic error (e.g., thinking $12+5=18$ or $12 \times 3 = 48$), thus rejecting both lines of working.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, "Below Basic" refers to students struggling with Level 3-4 (KS3), "Basic" to Grade 3-4 (GCSE), "Proficient" to Grade 5-6, and "Advanced" to Grade 7-9.

**below_basic:** A=25% B=45% C=10% D=20%
*Reasoning: These students frequently fall for Katie's error because "getting rid of the fraction" feels like the priority, and they often forget to multiply the isolated constant.*

**basic:** A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
*Reasoning: Students at this level start to prefer the "add 5 first" method as it’s what they've been drilled to do, but a significant portion still forgets the distributive property when multiplying.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
*Reasoning: Most should identify Tom as correct. Those choosing C are usually "over-confident" students who know $12 \times 3 = 36$ and assume Katie must be right without checking the $-5$.*

**advanced:** A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%
*Reasoning: At this level, students have mastered the distributive property and will immediately spot that Katie's line should have been $x - 15 = 36$ to be mathematically sound.*
