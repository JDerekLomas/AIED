As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen this specific type of question frequently in Key Stage 3 and GCSE Foundation assessments. Adding mixed numbers with common denominators is a core skill, but students often struggle with "fractional hygiene"—maintaining the denominator or following instructions regarding the format of the final answer.

### Step 1 — Analysis of reasoning

*   **A) \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \)** (Correct Reasoning): The student adds the integer parts (\(2+1=3\)) and then adds the fractional parts (\(1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5\)). They correctly keep the denominator the same and follow the instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number.
*   **B) \( \frac{18}{5} \)** (Incorrect Format): The student has performed the calculation correctly and converted it to an improper fraction (\(3 \times 5 + 3 = 18\)). However, they have failed to follow the specific instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number."
*   **C) \( \frac{18}{10} \)** (Misconception + Improper Format): This represents a double error. The student likely added the numerators and added the denominators (\(3/10\)), then attempted to incorporate the whole numbers or converted incorrectly. It reflects a fundamental lack of understanding of equivalent fractions and common denominators.
*   **D) \( 3 \frac{3}{10} \)** (Add Everything): This is a very common misconception. The student adds the whole numbers (\(3\)), adds the numerators (\(3\)), but also adds the denominators (\(5+5=10\)). This is the most common mistake made by students who view the numerator and denominator as independent integers rather than parts of a whole.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In a UK context, **Below Basic** equates to a student working towards Grade 1-2; **Basic** is Grade 3; **Proficient** is Grade 4-5; and **Advanced** is Grade 6+.

**below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%**
Students at this level are highly prone to "adding across" both top and bottom (Option D). They may also choose C because it looks more "mathematical" as a fraction, despite being incorrect.

**basic: A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%**
The majority of these students know to add the whole numbers, but the temptation to add the denominators (Option D) remains strong. A small percentage may ignore the "mixed number" instruction and provide B.

**proficient: A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%**
At this level, the concept of a common denominator is solid. The primary error becomes a failure to read the prompt carefully, leading to Option B, or a "lapse in concentration" leading to D.

**advanced: A=97% B=3% C=0% D=0%**
These students have mastered the algorithm. The only reason they would get this wrong is by rushing and failing to read the format requirement (Option B), though even this is rare for such a simple addition.
