As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this question as a classic test of **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)**. This is a common stumbling block for students transitioning from primary to secondary school (Year 7), but errors persist even into GCSE levels.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) $>$ (Correct Reasoning):**
    *   **Left Side:** Student follows BIDMAS correctly. Division before addition: $12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8 + 3 = \mathbf{11}$.
    *   **Right Side:** Student follows BIDMAS (brackets first). $(8 + 12) = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = \mathbf{5}$.
    *   Since $11 > 5$, they choose the correct symbol.
*   **B) $<$ (Incorrect Reasoning):**
    *   The student incorrectly adds first on the left side ($8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$) but treats the right side as having some higher value, perhaps by miscalculating $12 \div 4$ on the right side out of order. Alternatively, it is a "left-to-right" bias where they see more numbers inside a bracket and assume it must be larger.
*   **C) $=$ (Common Error):**
    *   The student lacks an understanding of BIDMAS entirely. They perform both operations from left-to-right or ignore the function of the bracket. They see both sides contain the digits 8, 12, and 4 and the operators $+$ and $\div$, concluding that the outcome must be identical regardless of arrangement.
*   **D) $\geq$ (Partial Logic/Guesswork):**
    *   The student may calculate that the left side is 11 and the right side is 5. Knowing $11 > 5$, they choose "Greater than or equal to" because it is technically a true mathematical statement. However, in the context of multiple-choice questions for this age group, it usually indicates a student who is slightly confused by inequality symbols or is over-complicating the logic.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

**Below Basic (UK Year 7, Working Toward Expectated Standard):**
These students often work purely left-to-right. They will calculate both sides as $5$ and gravitate toward the "equals" sign.
*   **A=15% B=15% C=65% D=5%**

**Basic (UK Year 8/9, Lower Ability GCSE):**
These students have heard of BIDMAS but apply it inconsistently. They may get the right side correct because of the visible brackets, but fail on the left side by adding 8 and 12 first.
*   **A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%**

**Proficient (GCSE Grade 4/5):**
Most students at this level understand that brackets change the order, but under exam pressure, about 20% will still make a "left-to-right" slip on the side without brackets.
*   **A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%**

**Advanced (GCSE Grade 7+, A-Level):**
These students see the structure of the expression immediately and may not even need to calculate the exact values to know that adding before dividing yields a smaller result than dividing a smaller portion then adding.
*   **A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%**
