As an experienced teacher, I recognize this question as a diagnostic check for **directed number operations** within the context of **expanding binomials**. The arrows point to the "Last" terms in the FOIL method: $-1$ and $-4$.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) $+4$ (Correct):** The student correctly identifies the operation as multiplication and applies the rule that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive ($(-1) \times (-4) = +4$).
*   **B) $-4$:** The student correctly identifies multiplication but fails the sign rule. They may believe "a negative and a negative stay negative" or simply bring the sign of the larger absolute value.
*   **C) $+5$:** The student incorrectly identifies the operation as addition (possibly due to the phrase "expanding brackets" being associated with "collecting terms") and misapplies sign rules, or thinks $-1 - 4$ is positive $5$.
*   **D) $-5$:** The student performs an additive operation instead of multiplication. They compute $-1 + (-4) = -5$. This is a very common "working memory" error where the student adds the coefficients instead of multiplying them.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK curriculum, "Below Basic" corresponds to students working well below age-related expectations (KS2 level), "Basic" to Grade 2/3 GCSE, "Proficient" to Grade 5/6, and "Advanced" to Grade 8/9.

**below_basic:** A=15% B=30% C=20% D=35%  
*At this level, students often default to addition because it is "easier" than multiplication, or they struggle significantly with negative sign rules.*

**basic:** A=45% B=25% C=5% D=25%  
*These students know they should multiply, but "a negative times a negative is a positive" is still a volatile rule. A significant portion will still treat the expression as an addition $(-1 - 4)$.*

**proficient:** A=85% B=5% C=0% D=10%  
*Most proficient students have mastered the sign rules for multiplication. Those who get it wrong usually do so because of a "lapse in concentration" resulting in addition ($1+4$).*

**advanced:** A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%  
*At this level, the error would be a rare "silly mistake" or misreading of the arrow, but the mathematical concept is firmly embedded.*
