As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently in Foundation and Higher GCSE tiers. It tests algebraic substitution and the ability to solve a two-step linear equation, often involving directed numbers (negatives) and decimals.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

**A) 3.3 (Correct Reasoning)**
The student correctly substitutes $y = 0.5$ into the equation:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$
This shows mastery of the order of operations and isolating the variable.

**B) 4.25 (Addition/Sign Error)**
The student likely misinterprets the relationship between $x$ and $y$. Instead of $10x - 6y$, they may have added the coefficients or handled the constant incorrectly. Specifically, some students calculate $10x = 30 + 6 + 6.5$ or perform $30 + 12.5$ then divide by 10, but the most common path to this specific decimal is an error in dividing by a wrong coefficient or misplacing a decimal point in a subtraction step (e.g., $42.5 \div 10$).

**C) -4.25 (Negative Coefficient Confusion)**
The student may have correctly identified the terms but struggled with the subtraction. They might calculate $10x + 3 = 30$ leading to $2.7$, but then over-correct or confuse the operation $30 - 3$ vs $30 + 3$, then apply a negative sign because they see the "$-6y$" and assume the answer must be negative.

**D) 2.7 (Sign/Operation Error)**
The student makes a common error with the negative sign. Instead of adding 3 to 30, they subtract it:
$10x - 3 = 30$ becomes $10x = 27$, so $x = 2.7$.
This is a very common "low-level" mistake where students move a term across the equals sign but do not change the sign.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

I have categorized "below_basic" as students targeting Grades 1-2, "basic" as Grade 3, "proficient" as Grades 4-5, and "advanced" as Grades 6+.

**below_basic:** A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%
*Reasoning: Students at this level often guess or perform random operations with the numbers shown (10, 6, 30, 0.5). Option D is attractive because subtraction feels "safer" than the correct inverse addition.*

**basic:** A=40% B=10% C=15% D=35%
*Reasoning: Many students at this level can substitute 0.5 into 6y to get 3, but they are highly likely to commit the "sign change" error, leading them to 2.7.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
*Reasoning: Most students in this bracket understand the need to add 3 to 30. Errors here are usually due to rushing and selecting D.*

**advanced:** A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
*Reasoning: Higher-tier students should find this trivial. Any errors are typically "calculator slips" or simple transcription errors.*
