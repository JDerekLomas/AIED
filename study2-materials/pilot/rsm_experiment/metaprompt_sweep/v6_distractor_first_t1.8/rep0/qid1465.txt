As a UK maths teacher, I encounter this specific type of question frequently when teaching Year 7 and Year 8 students. It highlights the classic misconceptions surrounding the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically the relationship between Addition and Subtraction.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

**A) $6$ (Correct reasoning)**
The student correctly applies BIDMAS. They multiply first ($4 \times 2 = 8$). The expression becomes $3 - 5 + 8$. Since Addition and Subtraction have equal priority, they work from left to right: $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 8 = 6$.

**B) $4$ (Addition before Subtraction misconception)**
The student follows the *acronym* BIDMAS too literally, believing Addition **must** come before Subtraction. They calculate $4 \times 2 = 8$, then do the addition $5 + 8 = 13$, leaving the expression as $3 - 13 = -10$. Wait—correction: Option B ($4$) usually comes from $3 - 5 = -2$ then $-2 + 4 = 2 \times 2 = 4$ (calculating left to right ignoring BIDMAS) OR more commonly, calculating $3-5+4 = 2$ then $2 \times 2 = 4$.

**C) $-12$ (Left-to-right + Addition mistake)**
The student ignores the order of operations entirely and works left to right, but makes a sign error or grouping error: $3 - 5 = -2$. Then they add $4$ to get $2$. If they accidentally did $3 - (5+4) \times 2$, they would get $3 - 9 \times 2 = -15$. $-12$ is often reached by $3-5 = -2$, $-2+4 = 2$, but if they mistakenly thought the minus applies to the whole bracket: $3 - (5+4+2)$... actually, **$-12$** is most commonly reached by $3-5 = -2$ and $4 \times 2 = 8$, then subtracting the two results or misapplying the negative: $-2 - 10$ etc.

**D) $-10$ (Strict BIDMAS Acronym error)**
This is the "expert's trap." The student knows BIDMAS but thinks A comes before S. They do $4 \times 2 = 8$. They then see $+4 \times 2$ as $+8$ and perform $5 + 8 = 13$ first. $3 - 13 = -10$. This is the most common error for mid-level students.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

In the UK curriculum, "Below Basic" students often ignore order of operations entirely (left-to-right), while "Basic/Proficient" students often fall into the Addition-before-Subtraction trap.

*   **Below_basic:** (Year 7/8 students struggling with numeracy)
    *   *Focus on left-to-right calculations.*
    *   **A=15% B=40% C=25% D=20%**
*   **Basic:** (Students who know BIDMAS exists but misapply it)
    *   *High tendency to do 5+8 first.*
    *   **A=30% B=15% C=10% D=45%**
*   **Proficient:** (Students comfortable with negatives and the Order of Operations)
    *   *Most understand that Addition and Subtraction are equal priority.*
    *   **A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%**
*   **Advanced:** (Students who have mastered algebraic hierarchy)
    *   *Minimal errors expected, usually only "slip of the pen."*
    *   **A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%**

**Teacher's Note:** Option **D** is the "distractor of the day." Many students feel they are being "clever" by doing addition before subtraction because the letter 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym, making it a very high-frequency error in the Basic and Proficient tiers.
