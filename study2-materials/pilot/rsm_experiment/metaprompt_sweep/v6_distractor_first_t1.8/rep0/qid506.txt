As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently in GCSE Foundation and higher-tier introductory algebra. It tests a student’s ability to manipulate fractions when solving linear equations, which is a notorious "trip-up" point.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) \( p=\frac{1}{4} \)**
    **Reasoning:** The student knows they need to divide, but they divide 12 by 3 (mental shortcut) and keep it as a fraction. Alternatively, they may mistakenly multiply the RHS by 3 instead of dividing by 3 (e.g., \(3 \times \frac{1}{12}\)). This is a very common "intuitive" mistake where students see 3 and 12 and immediately think "4".
*   **B) \( p=\frac{1}{36} \)**
    **Reasoning (Correct):** The student correctly identifies that to solve for \(p\), they must divide both sides by 3. This is equivalent to multiplying the denominator by 3: \( p = \frac{1}{12 \times 3} = \frac{1}{36} \).
*   **C) \( p=4 \)**
    **Reasoning:** The student ignores the fractional nature of the RHS entirely. They see the numbers 3 and 12 and perform \(12 \div 3\), arriving at a whole number. This is often seen in students who struggle with the concept of a reciprocal or fraction magnitude.
*   **D) \( p=\frac{1}{9} \)**
    **Reasoning:** The student often reaches this by subtracting 3 from the denominator (a "misapplied inverse operation") or misinterpreting the 3 as being related to the 12 via subtraction rather than multiplication/division. It can also occur from a calculation error during a cross-multiplication attempt.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, **Below Basic** aligns with students working at Grade 1-2, **Basic** at Grade 3, **Proficient** at Grade 4-5 (Standard/Strong Pass), and **Advanced** at Grade 6+.

**below_basic:** A=35% B=10% C=45% D=10%
*Rationale:* These students struggle with fractions. Many will treat the \( \frac{1}{12} \) as just "12" and choose 4, or see the relationship between 3 and 12 and pick \( \frac{1}{4} \).

**basic:** A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
*Rationale:* Students at this level know they should divide, but they often perform the operation on the denominator incorrectly. \( \frac{1}{4} \) is the "strongest distractor" here as it feels mathematically "neat."

**proficient:** A=20% B=65% C=10% D=5%
*Rationale:* Most students at the GCSE "Pass" level understand that \(3p = \dots\) means you divide by 3. A significant minority will still make the "12 divided by 3" mental slip, but the majority will correctly multiply the denominator.

**advanced:** A=5% B=92% C=1% D=2%
*Rationale:* High-ability students recognize this immediately as \( p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 \). Errors here are almost exclusively due to rushing (selecting A by mistake) rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.
