As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of algebraic fraction question frequently in GCSE Foundation and Higher tier papers. It tests the ability to find a common denominator—a skill often conflated with basic fraction addition.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) (Correct):** The student identifies that the lowest common multiple of $2x$ and $x$ is $2x$. They multiply the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 2 to get $\frac{8}{2x}$. They then correctly add the numerators ($3 + 8 = 11$) while keeping the common denominator $2x$.
*   **B) (Adding everything):** The student treats algebra like a literal "joining" exercise. They add the numerators ($3 + 4 = 7$) and add the denominators ($2x + x = 3x$). This is a very common misconception rooted in a lack of understanding of what a denominator represents.
*   **C) (Numerator doubling error):** The student realizes they need a common denominator but chooses $x$. They "halve" the first fraction incorrectly or, more likely, they multiply both numerators by the "other" denominator's coefficient but then forget the denominator is $2x$. Alternatively, they might do $(3 \times 1) + (4 \times 2) = 11$ but then simply write it over $x$ because they see $x$ in both terms.
*   **D) (Adding numerators only):** The student remembers they need a common denominator and notices $2x$ is a multiple of $x$. However, they fail to adjust the numerator of the second fraction. They simply calculate $3 + 4$ and place it over the "larger" denominator $2x$.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, these "Ability Levels" roughly correspond to: **Below Basic** (Working towards Grade 3), **Basic** (Grade 4/Standard Pass), **Proficient** (Grade 6/Targeting A-level), and **Advanced** (Grade 8/9).

**below_basic:** A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
*Reasoning: Students at this level almost always add straight across (Option B) or realize the denominator should be $2x$ but forget to change the numerator (Option D).*

**basic:** A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
*Reasoning: Many "Grade 4" students are wary of adding denominators but still frequently fall for the "add the tops" trap of Option D because it looks more "mathematical" than Option B.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
*Reasoning: By Grade 6, most students have mastered the mechanics of common denominators, but Option D remains a common "silly mistake" under exam pressure.*

**advanced:** A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
*Reasoning: For high-ability students, this is a routine 1-mark or 2-mark starter question. Errors are rare and usually down to misreading the numbers rather than a lack of method.*
