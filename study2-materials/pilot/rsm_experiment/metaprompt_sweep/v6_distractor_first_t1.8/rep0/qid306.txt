As a UK maths teacher, I frequently see these specific misconceptions when teaching BIDMAS/BODMAS. The common pitfalls here involve "reading from left-to-right" versus "order of precedence" and a misunderstanding of the "A" and "S" (Addition/Subtraction) being equal in priority.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) Left-to-right consistently:** The student applies a simple left-to-right rule to both problems, ignoring the priority of multiplication over addition in Problem Q.
*   **B) Correct reasoning:** For Problem P, the student knows that addition and subtraction have equal priority, so they work left-to-right (or treats it as $4 - 5 + 6$). For Problem Q, they correctly identify that multiplication must be performed before addition according to BIDMAS.
*   **C) The "Strict BIDMAS" error:** The student believes Addition must *always* come before Subtraction because 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym (mistakenly doing $5+6$ first), but then reverts to left-to-right for Problem Q, ignoring the multiplication rule.
*   **D) The Acronym Trap:** The student follows the literal letter-order of BIDMAS/BODMAS for both. They do the addition ($5+6$) before the subtraction in Problem P because A comes before S, and they correctly do multiplication ($5 \times 6$) before addition in Problem Q.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, Year 7 and 8 students struggle most with the parity of Addition and Subtraction. Many "High ability" students still fall into the trap of option D because the acronym is often taught too rigidly.

**below_basic:** (Likely to just read left-to-right or guess)
A=50% B=15% C=15% D=20%

**basic:** (Beginning to remember BIDMAS exists, but applies it literally or inconsistently)
A=30% B=30% C=10% D=30%

**proficient:** (Understand multiplication priority, but often succumb to the "Addition before Subtraction" myth)
A=15% B=45% C=5% D=35%

**advanced:** (Fully understand that + and - have equal priority and $\times$ has priority over +)
A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%

**Teacher’s Note:** Option D is the "high-level distractor." You will find many students who can solve complex equations but still insist that $4-5+6$ starts with $5+6$ because "the formula says Addition then Subtraction." Correcting this is a staple of Key Stage 3 mathematics.
