As an experienced teacher, I see this specific question as a "litmus test" for two distinct concepts: index laws and the rules of directed numbers. The negative base raised to an even power is a classic "trap" that catches students even at higher levels.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) 81 (Correct):** The student understands that $(-3)^4$ means $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$. They correctly calculate that $3^4 = 81$ and apply the rule that an even number of negative signs results in a positive product.
*   **B) 12:** The student has confused the exponent with a multiplier. Instead of calculating $k$ to the power of 4, they have calculated $k \times 4$. They often ignore the negative sign or assume it vanishes in multiplication ($3 \times 4 = 12$).
*   **C) -81:** This is the most common high-level error. The student knows $3^4 = 81$, but they do not realize the exponent applies to the negative sign as well. They may also be misled by their calculator; if they type $-3^4$ without brackets, the calculator correctly (according to BODMAS) performs the power first and then applies the negative.
*   **D) -12:** The student has combined both errors: they multiplied the base by the index ($3 \times 4$) and maintained the negative sign from the base.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions:

I have categorised these based on standard UK secondary school performance (Key Stage 3 and GCSE).

**below_basic (Working towards Grade 2):**
*A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%*
*Reasoning:* Students at this level frequently struggle with the definition of an index/power and will almost always default to multiplication. They are roughly equally likely to keep or lose the negative sign by guesswork.

**basic (Grade 3 - low Grade 4):**
*A=30% B=15% C=35% D=20%*
*Reasoning:* Students here generally understand that indices mean repeated multiplication, so B and D choices drop off. However, the rule for a "negative multiplied by a negative" is often applied inconsistently when done four times, or they simply stick a minus on the final answer because the question had one.

**proficient (Grade 5 - Grade 7):**
*A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%*
*Reasoning:* These students rarely make the "multiplication error" (B/D). However, option C is a huge attractor. Many students in this bracket are over-reliant on calculators and don't use brackets, leading them to believe -81 is the mathematically correct answer.

**advanced (Grade 8 - Grade 9 / A-Level):**
*A=92% B=0% C=8% D=0%*
*Reasoning:* Advanced students recognize this as a "trick" question. The 8% representing option C usually comes from "silly mistakes" under exam pressure or the aforementioned calculator input error, rather than a lack of conceptual understanding.
