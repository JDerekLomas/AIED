As an experienced UK maths teacher, I encounter this specific type of multi-step equation frequently. It tests the order of operations in reverse (rearranging) and the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) Only Tom:** The student recognises that to isolate the $x$ term, you must add 5 to both sides ($12 + 5 = 17$). They correctly identify Tom's step as the standard first move. However, they lack the "procedural flexibility" to realise that multiplying the entire equation by 3 (Katie's method) is also mathematically valid, even if less common.
*   **B) Only Katie:** The student mistakenly thinks you *must* multiply by the denominator first to "get rid of the fraction." They likely haven't seen Tom's addition step before or think it is "illegal" to add before multiplying. They also fail to see that Katie’s step is correct because $\frac{x}{3} \times 3 = x$ and $12 \times 3 = 36$.
*   **C) Both Tom and Katie:** This is the correct answer. The student understands that equations are balances. Tom added 5 to both sides (valid). Katie multiplied the entire equation by 3. Critically, the student knows that when multiplying an equation, **every term** must be multiplied ($ \frac{x}{3} \cdot 3 - 5 \cdot 3 = 12 \cdot 3 $). Since Katie’s result is $x - 15 = 36$, she is **incorrect**. Wait—re-evaluating Katie's statement: $x-5=36$. Katie **forgot to multiply the -5 by 3**. Therefore, Katie is actually **incorrect**.
*   **D) Neither is correct:** The student might be overthinking the "next line" or has made a calculation error in Tom’s addition.

**Correction on Step 1 Analysis (The Trap):**
I must look closer at Katie's working: $x - 5 = 36$.
If she multiplied by 3, the line should be $x - 15 = 36$.
**Katie is wrong.**
Therefore, the correct answer is **A (Only Tom).**

*   **A (Correct):** Student sees Tom added 5 correctly. They see Katie multiplied by 3 but missed the -5, making her wrong.
*   **B:** Student thinks you must multiply first and doesn't notice Katie's error with the -5.
*   **C (Common Trap):** Students see "$\times 3$" and see $12 \times 3 = 36$, and assume Katie is right without checking if she multiplied the $-5$.
*   **D:** Student thinks Tom should have subtracted 5 or that Katie’s 36 is wrong.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK curriculum (GCSE Years 9-11), the "Katie error" (not multiplying all terms) is one of the most persistent misconceptions in algebra.

**below_basic (Grade 1-2):** These students often struggle with the inverse of $-5$. Many will guess or choose C because both Tom and Katie look like they are "doing math" correctly.
**basic (Grade 3-4):** These students can solve Tom's step, but usually fall for the trap in C because $12 \times 3 = 36$ looks instinctively "correct" to them.
**proficient (Grade 5-6):** These students are more careful. They will verify Tom easily but may still be split 50/50 between A and C based on whether they check the constant term in Katie's working.
**advanced (Grade 7-9):** High-ability students will immediately spot that Katie failed to multiply the $-5$ by $3$ (the distributive law).
