As an experienced GCSE Maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently when testing linear equations and substitution. The difficulty for students usually lies in the sign management and the final division.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) 3.3 (Correct Reasoning):**
    The student correctly substitutes $y = 0.5$ into the equation: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$.
    $10x - 3 = 30$.
    They correctly add 3 to both sides: $10x = 33$.
    They correctly divide by 10 to get $x = 3.3$.

*   **B) 2.7 (Sign Error - Subtraction instead of Addition):**
    The student substitutes correctly: $10x - 3 = 30$.
    However, when moving the $-3$ across the equals sign, they subtract it (or simply calculate $30 - 3$) instead of adding: $10x = 27$.
    Resulting in $x = 2.7$. This is the most common conceptual error.

*   **C) 4.25 (Inverse Substitution/Variable Confusion):**
    The student confuses the variables or the structure. They might substitute $x = 0.5$ and try to solve for $y$: $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30 \rightarrow -6y = 25 \rightarrow y \approx -4.16$. 
    Alternatively, and more likely, they calculate $30 + 6 + 6.5 + 0.5$ or perform a calculation like $(30 + 10 + 2.5) / 10$ using numbers seen in the prompt. Another common route is $(30 + 6 \times 0.5)$ but then forgetting to divide by 10 and performing some other operation.

*   **D) -4.25 (Subtraction/Division Error):**
    Similar to option C, this usually arises from students who attempt to manipulate the equation $10x - 6y = 30$ into $y = mx + c$ incorrectly, or who struggle with the negative signs when $y$ is the subject. It often indicates a "guess" based on numbers that look mathematically "complex" (decimals).

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK curriculum, **Below Basic** (Grade 1-2) students often struggle with substitution into negative terms. **Basic** (Grade 3-4) students can substitute but often fail at the inverse operation (adding 3). **Proficient** (Grade 5-6) students usually get this right but may make a "silly" sign error under pressure. **Advanced** (Grade 7+) students find this straightforward.

| Ability Level | A (3.3) | B (2.7) | C (4.25) | D (-4.25) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 35% | 25% | 25% |
| **Basic** | 40% | 45% | 10% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 80% | 15% | 3% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 1% | 0% |

**Note on reasoning for Distribution:**
*   **Basic students** have a very high affinity for Option B ($2.7$) because they see the "$-$" sign in the equation and automatically think "take away," leading to $30 - 3$.
*   **Below Basic students** often struggle with the algebraic notation ($6y$) and will often choose $C$ or $D$ simply because they contain more decimals, assuming the answer to a decimal input must be a more complex decimal output.
