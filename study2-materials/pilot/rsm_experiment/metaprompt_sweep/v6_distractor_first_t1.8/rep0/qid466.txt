As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently when testing students' understanding of **reciprocals** and **directed numbers (integers)**. The question tests two distinct concepts simultaneously: the multiplicative inverse and the rules for multiplying negative numbers.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

**A) $\frac{4}{3}$ [Correct Reasoning]**
The student recognises that for the product of two numbers to be 1 (in magnitude), they must be reciprocals. They also correctly apply the rule that a negative multiplied by a positive results in a negative outcome ($-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1$).

**B) $-\frac{4}{3}$ [Misconception: Sign Overload]**
The student correctly identifies that the fraction needs to be inverted (the reciprocal). however, they have a "knee-jerk" reaction to the negative sign in the question or the answer. They likely think "negative times negative makes a positive," but because the answer is negative, they get confused and include a negative sign unnecessarily, or they confuse this with finding the negative reciprocal used in perpendicular gradients.

**C) $\frac{3}{4}$ [Misconception: Sign Change Only]**
The student focuses solely on the sign. They see the negative on the left and a negative result, and mistakenly think they just need the positive version of the same fraction to "keep it the same," neglecting the fact that $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} \neq 1$.

**D) $-\frac{3}{4}$ [Misconception: Identity Confusion]**
The student is confused between the Multiplicative Identity (multiplying by 1) and the target result. They might see the $-1$ and simply think they need to repeat the number in the question, or they think that multiplying a number by itself somehow results in 1.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, **below_basic** students often struggle with fractions generally, while **basic** students know the rules but apply them inconsistently. **Proficient** (GCSE Grade 4/5) students usually know the reciprocal rule but may trip up on signs. **Advanced** students (GCSE Grade 7+) handle both fluently.

**below_basic:** A=15% B=25% C=30% D=30%
*Reasoning: High guessing rate. Many will pick C or D because the numbers "look" like the numbers in the question. They lack the reciprocal concept.*

**basic:** A=35% B=30% C=20% D=15%
*Reasoning: The idea of flipping the fraction (reciprocal) is beginning to take hold, but they are highly likely to make a sign error (Option B) or get distracted by the visual similarity of the fractions.*

**proficient:** A=65% B=20% C=10% D=5%
*Reasoning: Most understand that $3/4 \times 4/3 = 1$. The primary distractor here is B, as they often overthink the "minus times minus" rule and accidentally apply it where it isn't needed.*

**advanced:** A=92% B=5% C=2% D=1%
*Reasoning: Advanced students perform a quick mental check: "Negative $\times$ Positive = Negative" and "Fraction $\times$ Reciprocal = 1." Errors are usually due to haste rather than lack of knowledge.*
