As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently when teaching expansion of binomials at Key Stage 3 and GCSE. It specifically targets the student’s understanding of the "L" in FOIL (Last terms) and their ability to handle directed numbers.

### Step 1 — Analysis of Reasoning

*   **A) +4 (Correct):** The student correctly identifies the two terms as $-1$ and $-4$. They know that "expanding" involve multiplication and correctly apply the rule that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive ($(-1) \times (-4) = +4$).
*   **B) -4:** The student knows they need to multiply the digits ($1 \times 4 = 4$), but they have a weak grasp of signs. They may think "the numbers are negative, so the answer stays negative," or they simply ignored the negative on the first term.
*   **C) +5:** This is a very common additive error. The student identifies the terms $-1$ and $-4$ but forgets they are *multiplying* to expand brackets. They perform $(-1) \times (-4)$ as if it were $-1 - 4$ but then lose a sign, or they see the two negatives and think they should "add" the digits to get 5, incorrectly applying the "two negatives make a plus" rule to the operation itself.
*   **D) -5:** Similar to C, this is an additive error. The student is "collecting" the terms rather than multiplying them. They calculate $-1 + (-4) = -5$. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the process of expanding brackets.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK curriculum, **below_basic** students often struggle with the distinction between additive and multiplicative operations when symbols are involved. **Proficient** students usually know the operation is multiplication but are still prone to "sign slips."

| Ability Level | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **below_basic** | 20% | 25% | 15% | 40% |
| **basic** | 45% | 20% | 10% | 25% |
| **proficient** | 85% | 10% | 2% | 3% |
| **advanced** | 98% | 1% | 0% | 1% |

**Key observations from a teaching perspective:**
*   **Below basic** students have a high affinity for **D** because they see $-1$ and $-4$ and their brain defaults to "counting" or combining rather than multiplying.
*   **Basic** students start to recognise the multiplicative nature of brackets but frequently choose **B** because they haven't mastered the "Negative $\times$ Negative = Positive" rule.
*   The gap between **Basic** and **Proficient** is usually where the "sign rules" become internalised.
