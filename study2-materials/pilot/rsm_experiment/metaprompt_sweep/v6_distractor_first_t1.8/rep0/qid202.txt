As a UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently in Key Stage 2 (Year 6) SATs and early Key Stage 3. It tests the fundamental understanding of adding mixed numbers with common denominators.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) \(3 \frac{3}{5}\):** **Correct reasoning.** The student adds the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and adds the numerators of the fractions ($\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$) while correctly maintaining the common denominator.
*   **B) \(\frac{18}{5}\):** **Procedural conversion without final formatting.** The student likely converted both to improper fractions ($\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5}$), added them correctly to get $\frac{18}{5}$, but failed to follow the specific instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
*   **C) \(\frac{18}{10}\):** **Computational error and denominator addition.** The student likely converted to improper fractions ($\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5}$) but then added both the numerators and the denominators ($11+7$ and $5+5$). This is a common misconception that "adding fractions means adding everything."
*   **D) \(3 \frac{3}{10}\):** **Whole number logic with denominator addition.** The student added the whole numbers correctly ($2 + 1 = 3$) and added the numerators correctly ($1 + 2 = 3$), but fell into the classic trap of adding the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$).

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK context, "Ability levels" roughly align with GCSE grade targets (e.g., Advanced = Grade 7+, Proficient = Grade 4/5, Basic = Grade 2/3).

*   **Below Basic:** These students often treat fractions as four independent whole numbers. Option D is highly attractive because it uses addition for every digit seen.
*   **Basic:** Students here have a vague memory that "denominators stay the same" but often struggle when whole numbers are involved, leading to inconsistent logic or failing to read the "mixed number" instruction.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually know the method but are prone to "reading errors" (ignoring the format requested) or minor calculation slips.
*   **Advanced:** These students rarely make procedural errors but may occasionally lose a mark by providing an improper fraction if they are rushing.

| Ability Level | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 10% | 30% | 40% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 15% | 10% | 30% |
| **Proficient** | 80% | 10% | 2% | 8% |
| **Advanced** | 97% | 2% | 0% | 1% |

**Teacher’s Note:** Option B is a "frustration trap." In many UK exams (like the SATs arithmetic paper), $\frac{18}{5}$ would be awarded the mark unless "mixed number" is explicitly requested in the answer box line. However, when specified, it becomes a test of following mathematical conventions.
