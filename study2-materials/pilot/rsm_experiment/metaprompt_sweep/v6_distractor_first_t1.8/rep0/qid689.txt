As a UK maths teacher, I frequently see this specific type of algebraic equation in Foundation Tier GCSE papers. The placement of the unknown $p$ in the denominator is a classic "trap" that tests whether a student truly understands inverse operations or simply relies on superficial pattern matching.

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

**A) $p=0.5$ (Correct)**
The student correctly rearranges the equation. They multiply both sides by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, then divide by 10 to get $p = 5/10$, which simplifies to $0.5$ (or $1/2$).

**B) $p=50$ (Multiplication Misconception)**
The student sees the numbers 10 and 5 and the fraction bar (division). Instead of performing the inverse, they incorrectly "move" the 5 by multiplying: $10 \times 5 = 50$. This is common among students who know they need to "do something with both numbers" but don't understand the structure of the equation.

**C) $p=2$ (Commutative Division Error)**
This is the most common distractor. The student intuitively knows that $10$ and $5$ are related by a factor of 2. They effectively solve $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$. They assume the larger number must be divided by the smaller number, ignoring that $p$ is the divisor.

**D) There are no solutions (Conceptual Barrier)**
The student may feel that since 5 is smaller than 10, dividing 5 by something cannot result in a larger number (10). This stems from the "division makes things smaller" misconception usually formed in primary school.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, **Below Basic** equates to students working at Grades 1-2; **Basic** to Grade 3; **Proficient** to Grades 4-5; and **Advanced** to Grades 6+.

**below_basic:** A=10% B=40% C=40% D=10%  
*Students at this level often guess based on "number bonding" (multiplication or simple division).*

**basic:** A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%  
*This group contains the highest density of Option C choosers. They are attempting algebra but default to $10 \div 5$ because it feels more "natural" than a fractional result.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%  
*Most students at this level can rearrange $10p = 5$ correctly, though some will still fall for the "mental shortcut" of $10 \div 5$ in a timed environment.*

**advanced:** A=98% B=0% C=2% D=0%  
*At this level, errors are almost exclusively "slip" errors (careless mistakes) rather than conceptual ones.*
