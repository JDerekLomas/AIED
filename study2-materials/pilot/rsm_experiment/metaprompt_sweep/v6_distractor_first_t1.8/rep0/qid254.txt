As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because it tests two distinct areas: the conceptual understanding of the number zero in statistics and the understanding of mathematical notation (order of operations).

### Step 1 — Reasoning Analysis

*   **A) [Correct reasoning]:** This is the correct calculation. To find the mean, you sum the values ($0+1+3+4+7$) and divide by the count of the numbers ($5$). Since adding 0 doesn't change the sum, the numerator $1+3+4+7$ is mathematically equivalent to $0+1+3+4+7$. Students choosing this understand that the zero must be counted as a value in the denominator.
*   **B) [Incorrect notation]:** This is a classic "calculator error." Students understand they need to add the numbers and divide by 5, but they fail to account for BIDMAS (Order of Operations). Written without brackets, this calculation would technically be $0+1+3+4+(7\div5) = 9.4$. This is a common trap for students who visualize the process horizontally.
*   **C) [Misconception of Zero]:** This represents a common misconception that "zero doesn't count." The student sums the non-zero digits and divides by 4, effectively ignoring the 0 entirely as if it weren't part of the dataset.
*   **D) [Confusion/Inflexibility]:** Students choosing this often realize that the $0$ is missing from the numerator in Option A and assume the calculation is therefore incomplete or incorrect. They fail to see the equivalence between $(0+1+3+4+7)/5$ and $(1+3+4+7)/5$.

### Step 2 — Predicted Distributions

In the UK system, **below_basic** refers to students working at Foundation Tier towards Grades 1-2; **basic** refers to Grade 3-4; **proficient** refers to Grade 5-6; and **advanced** refers to Grade 7-9.

**below_basic:** 
These students often struggle with the inclusion of zero and frequently make BIDMAS errors.
*   A=20% B=40% C=35% D=5%

**basic:**
This group usually remembers the "Add them up and divide" rule, but they are highly susceptible to the "zero doesn't count" misconception (Option C).
*   A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%

**proficient:**
These students generally understand that zero counts as a data point. Their main hurdle here is the "missing 0" in Option A, leading some to mistakenly pick D.
*   A=75% B=5% C=10% D=10%

**advanced:**
These students recognise the mathematical equivalence in Option A immediately and are sensitive to the BIDMAS error in Option B.
*   A=94% B=1% C=2% D=3%
