As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have seen thousands of students tackle fraction arithmetic. This specific question tests three distinct skills: finding a common denominator, converting between improper fractions and mixed numbers, and following final instructions.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) $\frac{99}{20}$:** This is the mathematically correct value. The student has converted to improper fractions ($\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4}$), found the common denominator of 20 ($\frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20}$), and added correctly to get $\frac{99}{20}$. However, they failed to "Leave your answer as a mixed number" as requested.
*   **B) $4 \frac{19}{20}$:** This is the correct answer. The student calculated $2+2=4$ and $\frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20}$, or they converted option A into its mixed number equivalent correctly.
*   **C) $\frac{99}{40}$:** The student successfully found the improper fractions ($\frac{27}{10}$ and $\frac{9}{4}$) but made a common error when adding: they multiplied the denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but adjusted the numerators incorrectly or simply added the adjusted numerators over the product of the denominators without understanding the scale factor. 
*   **D) $4 \frac{8}{14}$:** This represents the most common misconception in fraction addition at lower secondary level: "adding across." The student added the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), then added the numerators ($7+1=8$) and added the denominators ($10+4=14$).

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK system, **"Below Basic"** corresponds to students working well below age-related expectations (Level 3/4 or Grade 1/2), **"Basic"** to those developing fluency (Grade 3/4), **"Proficient"** to those meeting expectations (Grade 5/6), and **"Advanced"** to those aiming for top marks (Grade 7+).

| Ability Level | A | B | C | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 5% | 10% | 20% | 65% |
| **Basic** | 15% | 35% | 15% | 35% |
| **Proficient** | 25% | 60% | 10% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | 94% | 1% | 0% |

#### Teacher's Commentary on the Percentages:
*   **Below Basic:** The "Add Across" error (D) is overwhelmingly dominant here. Students see fractions as two separate numbers rather than a single value.
*   **Basic:** This group is split. Some have learned the algorithm for common denominators but often forget the final instruction (A) or fall back on "adding across" (D) when they get confused by the mixed numbers.
*   **Proficient:** These students know the method. The main loss of marks here is not reading the question carefully (choosing A) or making a slight calculation error in the common denominator process (C).
*   **Advanced:** Almost all will get this right. The small 5% for Option A accounts for "silly mistakes" where a high-achieving student works so fast they ignore the "mixed number" instruction at the end.
