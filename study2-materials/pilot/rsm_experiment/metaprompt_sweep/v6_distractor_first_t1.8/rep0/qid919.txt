As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this type of question frequently in Foundation and Higher tier GCSE practice. It tests two distinct skills: understanding the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and place value arithmetic with decimals.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option

*   **A) 0.81:** This stems from a misunderstanding of the equation's structure. The student likely calculates $(3x)^2$ rather than $3(x^2)$. They multiply $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then square $0.9$ to get $0.81$.
*   **B) 0.27:** **Correct Reasoning.** Following BIDMAS, the student squares the $x$ value first: $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$. Then, they multiply the result by 3: $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$.
*   **C) 1.8:** This is a "double-up" error combined with a decimal point slip. The student treats the square as "multiply by 2" ($3 \times 0.3 \times 2 = 1.8$) or incorrectly squares $0.3$ to get $0.6$ (thinking $3 \times 2$) and then multiplies by 3.
*   **D) 2.7:** This is the most common "place value" error. The student understands they need to square $0.3$ and multiply by $3$, but they calculate $0.3^2$ as $0.9$ (forgetting the second decimal place). Then $0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions

In the UK system, **Below Basic** (Grade 1-2) students struggle significantly with squaring decimals. **Basic** (Grade 3-4) students often know the order of operations but fail on decimal place value. **Proficient** (Grade 5-6) students usually navigate the BIDMAS but may still make a slip, while **Advanced** (Grade 7+) students find this trivial.

| Ability Level | A | B (Correct) | C | D |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 25% | 15% | 30% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 20% | 30% | 10% | 40% |
| **Proficient** | 10% | 70% | 5% | 15% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 95% | 1% | 2% |

**Teacher's Note on "Basic" distribution:** Option D is a massive distractor for students who "know" that $3^2 = 9$ and therefore assume $0.3^2 = 0.9$. Many students at this level will bypass the correct answer B because "it feels too small."
