As a UK maths teacher, I frequently see this specific quadratic expansion used to test a student's command of directed numbers (integers). The common pitfalls here involve the addition and multiplication of negative signs.

### Step 1 — Reasoning for each option:

*   **A) $m^{2}-2 m-35$:** The student has subtracted the numbers to find the coefficient of $m$ (e.g., $7 - 5 = 2$) instead of adding two negatives $(-5 + -7 = -12)$. Furthermore, they have correctly multiplied $5 \times 7$ but treated the signs as $(+5) \times (-7)$, leading to $-35$.
*   **B) $m^{2}-12 m+35$:** **Correct reasoning.** Using the FOIL method or grid method: $m \times m = m^2$; outside/inside terms $-7m - 5m = -12m$; and the constant term $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$.
*   **C) $m^{2}+12 m+35$:** The student understands the mechanics of expansion and that two negatives multiplied make a positive (for the 35), but they have made a sign error when summing the middle terms, effectively doing $5 + 7$ rather than $-5 - 7$.
*   **D) $m^{2}-12 m-35$:** A very common mistake where the student correctly sums the middle terms $(-12m)$ but fails the "negative $\times$ negative = positive" rule for the final constant, resulting in $-35$ instead of $+35$.

### Step 2 — Predicted distributions:

In the UK context, "Below Basic" refers to students working at Foundation Tier Grades 1-2; "Basic" at Grades 3-4; "Proficient" at Grades 5-6 (Higher Tier entry); and "Advanced" at Grades 7-9.

**below_basic:** A=30% B=15% C=25% D=30%
*Reasoning:* At this level, students often guess or focus only on the numbers rather than the signs. D is very attractive because "a negative stays negative."

**basic:** A=15% B=40% C=15% D=30%
*Reasoning:* Students know to add the numbers for the middle term, but many still reflexively put a minus at the end of the expression because they see two minus signs in the question.

**proficient:** A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
*Reasoning:* Most students at this level have mastered the FOIL method and the "double negative" rule for multiplication. Option D remains the primary "silly mistake" or distractor.

**advanced:** A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
*Reasoning:* High-achieving GCSE students find this trivial. Errors would likely be due to extreme exam pressure or rushing (leading to D), but most would self-correct upon checking.
