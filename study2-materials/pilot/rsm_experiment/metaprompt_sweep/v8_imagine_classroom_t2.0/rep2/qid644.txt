Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9 class, based on their common pitfalls with negative integers and algebraic operations.

**Predictive Breakdown:**

*   **The "Why" behind the errors:** 
    *   **The "Adders" (C and D):** Students like *Leo* and *Chloe* often get "operation fatigue." They see numbers in brackets and instinctively add them instead of multiplying, especially when the coefficient of $p$ is distracting them.
    *   **The "Sign-Blind" (B):** *Jake* will multiply $1 \times 4$ correctly but will ignore the "minus minus makes a plus" rule, or he'll assume that because there are minus signs in the question, the answer *must* stay negative.
    *   **The Proficient:** They’ll spot the trap immediately, reminding themselves "negative times negative."
