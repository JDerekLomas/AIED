Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30 students.

**Teacher's Reflection:**
Even for proficient students, this is a "danger" question because it targets two major misconceptions: the arithmetic of powers and the logic of negative bases. My "below basic" group won't see powers as multiplication at all; they see two numbers and multiply them. My "basic" and "proficient" groups will do the hard work of calculating $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$, but a significant portion will "keep the sign" because they associate a negative input with a negative output, or they've misremembered the rule that "a minus and a minus make a plus" as only applying to addition/multiplication of two terms, failing to see it pairs up for even exponents.

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
*(Note: These students see "3 and 4" and simply multiply. If they remember it's negative, they pick D; if they don't, they pick B.)*

basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
*(Note: These students know how powers work, but they reflexively put a negative sign on the answer because the k-value was negative. They see $T = -(3^4)$.)*

proficient: A=65% B=0% C=35% D=0%
*(Note: Most will get it right, but a third will fall into the trap of thinking an odd number of "steps" in the working or the presence of the negative symbol requires a negative result.)*

advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
*(Note: Almost all will get it, though one might rush and make a "silly mistake" by overthinking the notation versus how a calculator would process $-3^4$.)*
