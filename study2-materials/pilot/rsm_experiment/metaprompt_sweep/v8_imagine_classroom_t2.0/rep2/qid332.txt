To give you the predicted breakdown for this Year 9 class, I have to look at how students perceive "doing the same thing to both sides." 

The crux of the issue is that students often treat algebra like a sequence of "moves" rather than balance. While Tom’s move (adding 5 to both sides) is the standard next step, Katie’s move is mathematically legal but requires multiplying *every* term by 3. My students frequently forget that the $-5$ is a separate term.

Here is my prediction of how the 30 students will split:

**below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%**
(6 students) These students will mostly pick **B**. They have been conditioned to "get rid of the fraction first." They see the $\div 3$ and think "times by 3" immediately. They won't realise that Katie failed to multiply the $-5$ by $3$. Those who pick **D** are simply overwhelmed by the fraction and assume both are making mistakes.

**basic: A=50% B=30% C=20% D=0%**
(10 students) This group knows the "Rearranging" song and dance. Most will follow the priority of operations in reverse (SADMEB) and correctly identify Tom (Option **A**). However, a significant portion will see Katie's $12 \times 3 = 36$ and think, "Yes, that looks like a thing you're allowed to do," without checking if the $-5$ was accounted for.

**proficient: A=70% B=5% C=25% D=0%**
(10 students) These students are confident in solving. Most will immediately see that Tom is right and Katie is wrong. However, about a quarter of them—my "fast workers"—will see that $12 \times 3$ is indeed 36 and impulsively pick **C** because they aren't looking for the subtle error in Katie's distribution of the multiplication.

**advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%**
(4 students) My top-end students will spot Katie’s mistake instantly. One student might overthink it and choose **C**, wondering if "correct next line" allows for non-standard but technically valid intermediate steps, but ultimately even they will likely see that Katie’s equation ($x - 5 = 36$) is actually $x = 41$, whereas the original equation yields $x = 51$.

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=20% D=00%
proficient: A=70% B=05% C=25% D=00%
advanced: A=95% B=00% C=05% D=00%
