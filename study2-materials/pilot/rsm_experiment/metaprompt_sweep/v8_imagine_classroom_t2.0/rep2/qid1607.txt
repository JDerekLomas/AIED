Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9s.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
The "Lower Basic" group will likely gravitate towards **C**. They see the $60$ and the $1$ and their brain performs "instinctive arithmetic"—they see a 60 and a 1 and think "well, $60 + 1$ is $61$, so that must be right." They often ignore the operational signs in favour of "matching" numbers.

The "Basic/Proficient" groups will fall into the trap of **Step 2** because of the "Change side, Change sign" rule being misapplied. In their heads, they know they need to move the $+1$. However, they will subconsciously think: *"I'm solving for $k$, I have a $60$ and a $1$, it's an equation, so I should probably add them together."* They get "61" in their head first, then look at Step 2 and think, "Yep, that looks like what I just thought." They won't actually perform the inverse operation (subtracting 1) unless they are prompted to write it down.

Only my "Advanced" students will stop, look at Step 2, and mentally say, "Wait, it should be 59."

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=50% B=5% C=40% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
