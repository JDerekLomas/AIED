To predict the results for this Year 9 class, I’m looking at the classic "algebra as a foreign language" barrier. 

Even though this is a relatively straightforward "notation" question, Year 9s often struggle with the visual hierarchy of fractions. The "Below Basic" group will likely see the $+4$ and assume it needs to be "balanced" or separated from the denominator. The "Basic" group often falls into the trap of flipping the fraction (a hangover from dividing fractions earlier in the year) or failing to see the brackets as a single grouping unit.

Here is my predicted distribution based on 30 students across four flight paths:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=5% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=0% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%

**The "Why" behind the errors:**

*   **The Choice C trap (Below Basic):** Students like Chloe or Jack will see the $h+4$ in brackets and mentally "break it open." They often feel that a fraction bar should only sit under one term, leading them to think the $+4$ is an "extra" bit tagged onto the end of the division.
*   **The Choice D trap (Basic/Proficient):** Students like Leo will make a "Reciprocal Error." They’ve spent the last fortnight doing "Keep, Change, Flip" with numerical fractions. Their brain sees a $\div$ sign and a fraction bar and instinctively wants to flip the terms, putting the divisor on top because they’ve been conditioned that "division involves turning things upside down."
*   **The Choice B trap (Below Basic):** This is the "Visual Pattern" error. A student who is completely lost will look for symmetry or "completion." They see a $+4$ on the right and want to see a $+4$ on both levels of the fraction because it "looks more algebraic" or more "balanced."
