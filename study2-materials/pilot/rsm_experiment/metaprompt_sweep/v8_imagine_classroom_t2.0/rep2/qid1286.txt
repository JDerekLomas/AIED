Here is the predicted distribution and breakdown for my Year 9 class (a middle-to-high ability set).

**The Breakdown:**

*   **The "Inversion Error" (Distractor A/B):** My "Basic" and some "Proficient" students struggle with multi-step rearrangements. When they see $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, their instinct is to "move the numbers over." Many will multiply by the 4 and divide by the 3 because the 4 is "on top." They often treat $\pi$ as a separate entity to be dealt with later, leading them to A or B.
*   **The "Fraction Fright" (Distractor D):** I have a handful of students like *Leo* or *Sarah* who know the cube root is involved but are terrified of nested fractions. Option D looks "cleaner" to them. They've mistakenly applied the cube root only to the $V$ and then tried to "solve" the rest of the coefficients as a separate fraction.
*   **The "Formula Confusion":** Some students will confuse the Sphere Volume formula with Surface Area or even a Cone, but because this is multiple choice, the presence of the "3" and the "$\sqrt[3]{\quad}$" will guide most of them toward the structure of the correct formula, even if they manipulate it wrong.

**Predicted Results:**

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=95% D=0%
