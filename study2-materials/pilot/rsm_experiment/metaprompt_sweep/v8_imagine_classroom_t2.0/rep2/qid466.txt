To give you the most accurate prediction, I’m categorising these 30 students based on their typical confidence with negative numbers and reciprocal operations.

**The Logic behind the errors:**
*   **The "Double Negative" Trap:** Many students have the phrase *"two negatives make a positive"* etched into their brains. They will see the negative in the question and the negative in the answer and mistakenly conclude the star *must* be positive to avoid "messing up" that rule. This leads them to Choice A.
*   **The "Additive Inverse" Confusion:** My "Basic" level students often confuse the rules for multiplying fractions with adding them. They see the -1 and think they need to "add back" the 3/4 to get to zero, or they simply get spooked by the fraction and pick D because it looks familiar.
*   **The Sign Overthinkers:** My "Proficient" students know it’s the reciprocal ($4/3$), but about a third of them will panic about the sign. They'll perform the calculation correctly but then doubt themselves: *"Wait, is it negative times negative equals positive? Yes... wait, the answer is -1, so I need... uh..."* and they'll flick to B or A last minute.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=95% C=0% D=0%
