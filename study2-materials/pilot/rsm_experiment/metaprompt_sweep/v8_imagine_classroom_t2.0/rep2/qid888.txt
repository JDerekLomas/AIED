Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9s.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**

*   **Option B (The Correct Answer):** My proficient and advanced students will see this instantly. They’ve internalised that a "negative times a negative is a positive," and they will combine $-5$ and $-7$ correctly to get $-12m$.
*   **Option D (The "Negative Ninja" Trap):** This will be the most common mistake across the board. Students like **Jack** and **Leo** often remember that they need to multiply the numbers, but in the heat of the moment, they see two minus signs in the bracket and instinctively think the answer *must* stay negative. They "apply" the sign without thinking about the rule $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$.
*   **Option A (The Subtraction Error):** I expect **Sophie** and a couple of others to get this. They won't use a grid or FOIL; they'll look at 5 and 7 and find the *difference* rather than the sum. Their brains see the signs as "opposite-ish" and they'll do $7 - 5 = 2$, landing them on $-2m$.
*   **Option C (The Sign Confusion):** **Chloe** will likely choose this. She knows that "two minuses make a plus" but she over-applies it to the middle term as well, assuming that because there are two minuses in the question, the whole thing should just "become positive."
