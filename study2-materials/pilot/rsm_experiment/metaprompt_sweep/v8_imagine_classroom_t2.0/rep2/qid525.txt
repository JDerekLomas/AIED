To give you the most accurate prediction, I’m categorising these 30 students based on their prior attainment data and how I’ve seen them handle fractions over the last two terms. 

Year 9 students often overcomplicate mixed numbers. They have a tendency to convert everything to improper fractions unnecessarily because that's the "safest" rule they remember, which leads to huge numerators and high arithmetic error rates.

Here is my prediction for the class distribution:

**The Breakdown of the Wrong Answers:**
*   **The "Add Across" Trap (D):** My 'Below Basic' group (e.g., Leo and Chloe) will go straight for D. They see $2+2=4$ and $7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$. It looks "neat" to them, and they lack the estimation skills to realize $8/14$ is much too small.
*   **The "Wrong Denominator" Trap (C):** Students like Marcus will correctly turn them into $27/10$ and $9/4$ but will then multiply the denominators to get $40$ without adjusting the numerators correctly, or simply fail to simplify. They'll see "99" and "40" and think it looks like a "mathsy" answer.
*   **The "Improper Instruction" Trap (A):** My 'Proficient' group (like Amara) will do the hard work correctly. They’ll get $99/20$. However, in their haste, they will ignore the "Leave your answer as a mixed number" instruction. They'll see $99/20$ sitting there as Option A and click it in relief, thinking they've finished.

**Predicted Results:**

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=30% B=60% C=10% D=0%
advanced: A=5% B=95% C=0% D=0%
