Here is the predicted distribution and analysis for my Year 9 class of 30.

**below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=10% D=60%**
These students (like *Leo* and *Chloe*) rely purely on reading left-to-right. Their internal logic is "I just do the sums as they come." They see $3-5$ and get $-2$, then see $-2+4$ and get $2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$. However, many will mistakenly add before subtracting due to a rigid, literal interpretation of 'A' before 'S' in BIDMAS ($5+4=9$, then $3-9=-6$, which isn't an option, so they panic and just go left-to-right or guess). Option D is the "Total BIDMAS failure" trap—adding before multiplying ($3-5+8$ but doing $5+4$ first).

**basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%**
The majority of the middle-set kids will correctly identify that multiplication comes first ($4 \times 2 = 8$), leaving them with $3 - 5 + 8$. However, their downfall is the "Add before Subtract" trap. They see the 'A' before 'S' in BIDMAS and think they *must* do $5+8=13$ first, resulting in $3-13 = -10$ (Option D). Others will reach $3-5+8$ and calculate it as $3-13$ or simply make a signed-number error at the end to get Option B. Option A is the correct path they frequently stumble upon by accident or correct logic.

**proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%**
Students like *Amara* know multiplication comes first. They get to $3-5+8$. They are starting to understand that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be done left-to-right. However, under the pressure of a quick quiz, a few will still fall for the "Addition must come first" mnemonic trap and select D, or make a clumsy mental arithmetic slip with the negative number ($3-5 = -2$, then $-2+8$) and arrive at 6.

**advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%**
My top-table students (like *Sam* and *Priya*) won't even hesitate. They treat the $-5$ as a term in its own right. They see it as $3 + (-5) + 8$. They have moved past the "letters of BIDMAS" and understand the hierarchy of operations properly. They’ll likely finish this in 5 seconds and wonder why I’m asking it.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
The biggest hurdle isn't the multiplication—it's the **BIDMAS Mnemonic Trap**. Students are taught "Addition then Subtraction," so when they see $3-5+8$, their brain screams "Add the 5 and 8 first!" Even my Proficient students often forget that addition and subtraction are "siblings" with equal weight. Option D is the most "logical" wrong answer for a student who knows some rules but hasn't mastered the nuances of directed numbers.
