Here is the predicted distribution for your Year 9 class, based on typical classroom misconceptions regarding BIDMAS/BODMAS and the visual "distractors" in this specific equation.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The Left Side ($8+12 \div 4$):** Many students in the below_basic and basic categories will read this left-to-right. They see $8+12$, which is a "nice" number (20), and then divide by 4 to get 5. They completely ignore the order of operations because the addition feels more instinctive. Those who get it right ($11$) are those who have internalized that division happens first.
*   **The Right Side ($(8+12) \div 4$):** Almost everyone will get 5 here because the brackets force the $8+12$ first. 
*   **The Trap:** Students who get 5 for the left side (due to the left-to-right error) will see 5 on the right side and confidently pick **C (=)**. 
*   **The Advanced Student:** They won't even calculate the full values. They’ll see that on the left, only the 12 is divided by 4, whereas on the right, the whole $(8+12)$ is divided by 4. They know $8 + 3$ is obviously larger than $20 \div 4$.

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=80% D=0%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=65% D=0%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=20% D=0%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
