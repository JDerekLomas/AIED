Here is the predicted distribution for a typical mixed-ability Year 9 class.

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=50% D=0%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=25% D=0%
proficient: A=85% B=0% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%

**The Analysis:**

**Why "Below Basic" students fail:**
The biggest trap here is Option C. Students at this level often treat zero as "nothing." They physically see four non-zero digits and their muscle memory screams "divide by how many numbers there are," which they interpret as "how many numbers that have a value." They will skip the zero entirely. Those who choose B are the ones who rely heavily on their basic scientific calculator; they know the steps but don't understand the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS), not realising that without brackets, the calculator will only divide the 7 by 5.

**Why "Basic" students succeed/fail:**
Most will correctly identify that they need to divide by 5, leading them to A. However, a significant chunk of these students will still be lured by C because they’ve been told "zero doesn't change the sum," and they lack the conceptual depth to realize it still affects the "n" value (the denominator).

**Why "Proficient" students succeed/fail:**
The "Proficient" students are my most interesting group. Most will choose A instantly. However, the ones who get it wrong will actually "overthink" themselves into choosing D. They will look at A, notice the '0+' is missing from the numerator, and think it's a trick. They'll tell me, "Sir, you can't have the mean without including all the numbers in the sum," failing to realise that $(0+1+3+4+7)$ is mathematically identical to $(1+3+4+7)$.

**Why "Advanced" students succeed:**
These students see through the formatting immediately. They know that adding zero doesn't change the total, but including it in the count (the 5) is non-negotiable. Only a tiny fraction might slip up by being too fast and clicking D because it "looks" incomplete.
