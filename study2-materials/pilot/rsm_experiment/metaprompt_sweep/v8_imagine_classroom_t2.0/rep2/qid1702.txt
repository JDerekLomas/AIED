To predict this distribution, I have to account for how Year 9s interact with decimals and two-step linear equations.

The most common "clever" mistake is **D (2.7)**. These students will substitute correctly but trip on the arithmetic: $10x - 3 = 30$, then subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it, getting $10x = 27$. 

**C (3.3)** is the "positive only" mistake. These are the students who handle the negative sign correctly ($10x = 33$) but don't check their work.

**B (-4.25)** represents the "visual guess" cohort. They see a negative in the equation and assume the answer must be negative, or they attempt to rearrange the formula $10x - 6y = 30$ and make multiple sign errors.

**A (4.25)** is the correct answer. Even though it's a decimal, the calculation is relatively clean once they get to $10x = 33$.

Here is my predicted distribution for my class of 30:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=20% D=35%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=15% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
