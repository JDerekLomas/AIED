To predict the results for this Year 9 class, I’m looking at the classic "fraction panic." Even though this is a one-step linear equation, the presence of the fraction $1/12$ triggers a cognitive shortcut where students stop thinking algebraically and start looking for familiar number bonds (3, 4, 12).

Here is my predicted distribution based on typical classroom misconceptions:

**Below Basic (6 students):** These students see "3" and "12" and immediately think "4." They will likely multiply because they feel they need to "get rid of the small fraction" or they'll just choose the whole number because fractions are intimidating.
**Basic (10 students):** This is the largest group. They know they need to divide by 3, but their mental model of division is "splitting things up." They see $12 \div 3 = 4$, and instinctively place the 4 in the numerator or denominator without thinking about the reciprocal.
**Proficient (9 students):** They understand the method ($\div 3$) and can handle the fraction. They might pause, but they'll correctly calculate $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$.
**Advanced (5 students):** They will spot the trap instantly and might even feel insulted by how "easy" it is, provided they don't overthink it and wonder if it's a trick.

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=50% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=85% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
