To a Year 9 class, this is a classic "common sense" trap. The brain sees 10 and 5 and desperately wants the answer to be 2. Even my stronger students have to fight the urge to say "10 divided by 5 equals 2," rather than actually rearranging the algebraic reciprocal.

**Predictive breakdown:**

*   **Below Basic (4 students):** These students are overwhelmed by the fraction. They will look for a whole number that fits 5 and 10 and circle C (p=2) without hesitation. A couple might multiply them and pick B.
*   **Basic (10 students):** The "Rule-Followers." They remember they need to "do something with the numbers." Most will think "10 divided by 5" and pick C. This is where the biggest cluster of C's will be.
*   **Proficient (12 students):** These students know it’s not just a simple division, but many will trip over the mental arithmetic of $5 \div 10$. Half will get to $p = 0.5$ (A), the other half will buckle under the pressure of the clock and go with their gut instinct of C.
*   **Advanced (4 students):** These students will instinctively multiply by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, then divide by 10. They will check their answer ($5 \div 0.5 = 10$) and be confident in A.

**The "Why":** The most common mistake isn't a lack of knowledge, it's "Cognitive Closure." Students see $10$, $5$, and $p$ in a fraction; their brain shouts "2" so loudly that they don't even bother to substitute it back in to see that $5 \div 2$ is actually $2.5$.
