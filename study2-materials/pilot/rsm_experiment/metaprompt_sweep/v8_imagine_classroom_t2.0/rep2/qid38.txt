To predict the outcome for my Year 9s, I have to look at the specific hurdles of algebraic fractions. **Option B** is the classic "add across" trap (3+4 over 2x+x), which attracts students who treat algebra like basic arithmetic. **Option D** is the "panic response"—adding the numerators but forgetting to adjust for the denominator of 2x.

Here is the predicted distribution based on my 30 students:

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
*(These students, like Tyler and Sarah, will see two fractions and instinctively add everything. They’ll see 3+4 and 2x+x and go straight for B without even picking up a pen. They haven't internalised that denominators must be common AND constant.)*

basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
*(This group knows they need a common denominator, but their execution is shaky. Students like Leo will identify that the denominator should be 2x, but they will forget to multiply the 4 by 2. They'll just do 3+4 over 2x, leading them to D. A few will still fall for B because it "looks right".)*

proficient: A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
*(The majority of the class, like Maya and Chloe, will correctly identify that $\frac{4}{x}$ needs to become $\frac{8}{2x}$. However, 15% will make a "silly" calculation error under pressure—doubling the 4 to get 8, then adding 3 but somehow arriving at 10 or forgetting to add it at all, though most will hit A.)*

advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
*(Students like James will see this as a 5-second problem. They have moved past the "common denominator" struggle and see the equivalence immediately.)*
