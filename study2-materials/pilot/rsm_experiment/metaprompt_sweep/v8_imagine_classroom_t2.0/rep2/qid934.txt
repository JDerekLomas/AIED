Here is the predicted distribution based on typical Year 9 classroom misconceptions.

The primary hurdle here is that the equation is not in the "friendly" form of $y = mx + c$. Students often see a table of values and instinctively try to "put the $x$ number in the box," but the presence of the $2y$ creates a massive cognitive trap for those who haven't mastered two-step substitution or basic rearrangement.

**Predictive Breakdown:**

*   **Option C (5) is the correct answer:** Found by substituting $x=0$, resulting in $2y = 10$, so $y=5$.
*   **Option A (20):** Chosen by students who substitute $x=0$, get $2y=10$, but then mistakenly *multiply* by 2 instead of dividing ($10 \times 2 = 20$).
*   **Option B (3):** A "pattern seeker" error. They assume the $x$ column is $x, y, x, y...$ or they try to find a number that "looks right" with 4 and 2.
*   **Option D (2.5):** Chosen by students who see $4x$, ignore the $+ 2y$ entirely, and try to do $10 \div 4$.

**The Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will see the $x=0$ and the number 10 and assume $10 \times 2$ (20) or simply guess.
*   **Basic:** They will correctly substitute $0$ for $4x$, but once they see $2y = 10$, they will struggle with the inverse operation, often guessing or picking the only decimal available (D).
*   **Proficient:** These students know they need to solve for $y$. However, a few will rush, see the "4" in $4x$, and accidentally divide 10 by 4 instead of by 2.
*   **Advanced:** They will mentally rearrange to $2y = 10$ and solve instantly, though one or two might make a "silly mistake" by looking at the wrong column.
