Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30 students.

**Teacher's Intuition:**
The "trap" here isn't Problem Q (most Year 9s have had BIDMAS drilled into them regarding multiplication); it is the "A" in BIDMAS for Problem P. Many students believe "Addition" must strictly happen before "Subtraction" because of the letter order, rather than working left-to-right.

*   **The "Below Basic" group** will often default to reading left-to-right for everything, forgetting BIDMAS entirely (Option A).
*   **The "Basic" and "Proficient" groups** are the most likely to get this wrong by picking **Option D**. They over-correct: they know "Multiplication before Addition" for Q, so they assume "Addition before Subtraction" must apply to P.
*   **The "Advanced" group** knows that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and are solved left-to-right.

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=0% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=0% D=35%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
