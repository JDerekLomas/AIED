Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 class in the UK, based on common misconceptions regarding fractions.

**Teacher's Notes:**
The main pitfalls here aren't the addition itself, but the instruction to "leave as a mixed number" and the "reflex" many Year 9s have developed to add the denominators. **B** will be a popular trap for the higher achievers who over-complicate things by converting to improper fractions first and forgetting to convert back. **D** will be the "autopilot" error for those who treat fractions like whole numbers.

**below_basic:** A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
*Context: These students see "plus" and instinctively add every number they see (2+1, 1+2, 5+5), leading them to D. Others will pick C because it looks "mathsy" or simply guess A.*

**basic:** A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%
*Context: Most will get the right answer, but a significant portion will still fall for the D trap (adding denominators). Some will convert to an improper fraction (18/5), see it isn't listed as A and panic-switch to B.*

**proficient:** A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%
*Context: These students know the rules. Those who get it wrong (B) will likely have converted to 11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5. Even though the question asks for a mixed number, they’ve been so conditioned to prefer improper fractions in Year 9 that they'll tick B and move on without re-reading the prompt.*

**advanced:** A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
*Context: The only errors here are "silly mistakes." They might choose B because they are working too fast and didn't read the final sentence of the instruction.*
