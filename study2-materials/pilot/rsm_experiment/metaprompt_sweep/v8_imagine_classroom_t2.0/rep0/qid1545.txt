Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9 class of 30, based on their typical misconceptions with BIDMAS/BODMAS.

**Teacher's Instinct Notes:**
The left side is $8 + 3 = 11$. The right side is $20 \div 4 = 5$. Therefore, the answer is **A**.
However, my **below_basic** students often treat maths like reading a book (left-to-right). They will calculate $(8+12) \div 4$ for *both* sides, leading them to think the answer is C. My **basic** students will remember BIDMAS exists but often think "Addition comes before Subtraction" means it also comes before Division if it looks "tidier," or they will over-correct and ignore the brackets on the right. My **proficient** students usually nail the brackets but might make a mental arithmetic error on $12 \div 4$. My **advanced** students will see the trap immediately.

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=80% D=0%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=45% D=0%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=10% D=0%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
