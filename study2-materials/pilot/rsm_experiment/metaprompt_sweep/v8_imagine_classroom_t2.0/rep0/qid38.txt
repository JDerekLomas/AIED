Based on my experience with Year 9, a question like this acts as a "logic trap." Many students who are confident with arithmetic fractions lose their footing the moment an $x$ appears in the denominator. 

I predict **Chloe and Jack** will jump straight to B; they have a "lateral" thinking habit where they just add everything across the top and bottom because it looks neat. **Leo**, who usually understands common denominators but works too quickly, will likely pick D because he’ll find the common denominator ($2x$) but forget to multiply the second numerator, just adding 3 and 4. **Aisha and Sam** will get it right, but even they might pause to wonder if they should be "cancelling" the $x$ somehow.

Here is how I expect the 30 students to split:

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
