To a teacher, this looks trivial. To a Year 9 student, this is a "blind spot" question. It challenges their internal rule that "the bigger number must be divided by the smaller number." 

My "Below Basic" group will see $10$ and $5$ and immediately perform $10 \times 5$ because they are conditioned to use the inverse operation on the two numbers visible to them. My "Basic" and "Proficient" groups are the danger zone; many will perform $10 \div 5 = 2$ because their brains automatically simplify the calculation to be "manageable," completely ignoring the fact that $p$ is the divisor. They’ll see Option C and feel validated by its presence.

Only the "Advanced" group will consistently handle $p$ as a denominator and realise the answer must be smaller than 1.

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=30% D=0%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=70% D=0%
proficient: A=40% B=5% C=55% D=0%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
