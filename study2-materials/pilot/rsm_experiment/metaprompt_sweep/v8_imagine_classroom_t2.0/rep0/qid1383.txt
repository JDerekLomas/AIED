Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30 students.

**Teacher's Reflection:**
Even though this looks like a straightforward substitution, it's a "classic trap" question. The **Below Basic** group will confuse indices with multiplication (the most common lower-level error). The **Basic** and **Proficient** groups will battle with the "negative power" rule. 

Many students will think: "3 to the power of 4 is 81. There is a minus sign. Therefore, the answer is minus 81." They often remember the rule "a negative times a positive is a negative," but forget that an even number of negatives cancel out. They see the negative in the question and feel like the answer *must* feel negative. Only my **Advanced** students will instinctively recall that even powers yield positive results regardless of the base's sign.

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=50% B=0% C=50% D=0%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
