To a Year 9 class, this is a "confidence trap." Even students who are good at algebra are prone to rushing. They will see $15 \times 4 = 60$ and $60 + 1 = 61$ and assume Isaac followed a logical path. They focus on the arithmetic rather than the inverse operations.

My **below_basic** group (Set 4/5) will often pick C because the numbers "look right" and they don't look closely at Step 2.
My **basic** and **proficient** groups (Set 3) will provide the bulk of the B and C answers. They will see Step 2 ($60 + 1 = 61$) and their brains will subconsciously do the addition because it's the "next step" without questioning if it should have been subtraction. They are likely to skip Step 1 analysis entirely and just validate the numbers.
My **advanced** students (Set 1) are the only ones who will pause and realize that while Step 1 is a correct multiplication, Step 2 is an incorrect inverse of a positive 1.

**Predicted Distribution:**

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=40% B=15% C=40% D=5%
advanced: A=85% B=0% C=15% D=0%

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The "Isaac must be right" bias (C):** Students often assume that if a worked example is given in a "find the error" format, the error must be subtle or the student is "tricking" them, leading them to agree with both steps because the arithmetic ($15 \times 4$ and $60 + 1$) is correct.
*   **Inverse confusion (B and C):** Many will see $60$ and $1$ and automatically think $61$ because their brain is in "accumulation mode" rather than "balancing the equation" mode. They forget that to move a $+1$, you must $-1$.
*   **The Step 1 Oversight (B):** Some students will focus so hard on Step 2 being "maths that makes sense" ($60+1=61$) that they don't even check if Step 1 was a valid algebraic move.
