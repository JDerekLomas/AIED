To predict this, I’m thinking about the common "sign blindness" and the "reciprocal reflex" that kicks in mid-way through Year 9.

**The Logic:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students see two minus signs in the question ($-\frac{3}{4}$ and $-1$) and their brain triggers the "two minuses make a plus" rule incorrectly, leading them to look for a positive answer. Many will pick **C** simply because it's the "flip" of a negative.
*   **Basic:** They know that to get to "1", they need to flip the fraction ($\frac{4}{3}$). However, they often forget that a negative times a negative is a positive. Because the target is $-1$, they think "I need to keep it negative, so the multiplier must be positive." This makes **A** the most common trap for this level.
*   **Proficient:** These students have mastered the reciprocal but are over-thinking the signs. They might hesitate and choose **B** because they correctly remember that $x \cdot \frac{1}{x} = 1$, and they assume they need the same sign to maintain the integrity of the operation, or they just perform the calculation $(-1) \div (-3/4)$ and (hopefully) get the sign right.
*   **Advanced:** They see it instantly. They know that a negative times a positive stays negative, and the fraction must be the reciprocal. They don't get bogged down in the "two minuses" trap.
