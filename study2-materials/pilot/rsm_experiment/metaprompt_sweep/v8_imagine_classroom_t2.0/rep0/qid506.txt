To give you some context on my Year 9s: This is a classic "fraction trap." Even though they’ve been doing algebra for years, seeing a fraction on the right-hand side causes a temporary "cognitive overload" where their eyes hunt for easy number bonds rather than following the process.

**The "A" Trap (p=1/4):** This will be my most common wrong answer. Students like Leo or Chloe will see the numbers 3 and 12 and immediately think "3 goes into 12 four times." Their brains subconsciously flip the operation to $12 \div 3$ because it results in a "cleaner" number than the actual division.

**The "B" Crownd (p=1/36):** My top set kids (The "Advanced" group) will sail through this. Some of my "Proficient" kids like Sam will hesitate, remember the rule "to get rid of the 3, I must divide," and realize they are doing $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$, which means $12 \times 3$ on the bottom.

**The "C" Trap (p=4):** This is for my "Below Basic" group. Students like Tyler often ignore the fraction entirely. They see $3p$ and $12$, assume it’s a standard one-step equation they did in Year 7, and provide the integer answer.

**The "D" Trap (p=1/9):** This is the "Squared" error. A few students might misread the 12 as a 3 or try to find some relationship between $3 \times 3$.

Here is my predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=50% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=35% B=60% C=5% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
