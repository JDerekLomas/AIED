Here is the predicted distribution and the reasoning behind the mistakes for my Year 9s.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The Left-to-Right Mistake (Option B):** This is the most common pitfall for the "basic" and "below basic" groups. They forget BIDMAS entirely and treat it like a calculator from 1990: $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$.
*   **The BIDMAS Conflict (Option D):** Many students remember multiplication comes first ($4 \times 2 = 8$), but then they see the string $3 - 5 + 8$. A significant number of students believe that Addition (A) *must* happen before Subtraction (S) because of the acronym. They calculate $5 + 8 = 13$, then do $3 - 13 = -10$. This is a classic "order of operations" trap.
*   **The Total Chaos (Option C):** Usually results from adding $3+5$ first ($8+4 = 12$) and then misapplying the sign or the multiplication.

**Predicted Answer Distribution:**

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=5% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=0% D=15%
advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
