Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9 class, based on their current progress with quadratic expansion.

**Predicted Results:**
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=10% D=50%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%

**The Logic Behind the Wrong Answers:**

*   **Option D (The "Double Negative" Trap):** This is where most of my "Basic" and lower "Proficient" students will fall. They correctly add $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12m$, but in their heads, they are thinking "negative, negative... my answer must be negative." They forget that multiplying two negatives produces a positive. They see the minus signs in the brackets and reflexively look for an answer with minus signs.
*   **Option A (The "Difference" Error):** This is my "Below Basic" group. Instead of seeing two negatives to be added, they find the difference between 7 and 5. They do $7 - 5 = 2$ and attach the middle term to it. They usually also get the sign of the constant wrong for the same reasons as above.
*   **Option C (The "Ignore the Signs" Group):** These students have the mechanics of FOIL/Grid Method down, but they find negatives "annoying" so they subconsciously ignore them. They see 5 and 7, they add them to get 12, they multiply to get 35, and they keep everything positive because it’s "easier."

The **Proficient** students will mostly get **B** because we've drilled the "Multiply for the end, Add for the middle" rule, but under the pressure of a quick quiz, even a few of them will slip up on the $(-5) \times (-7)$ calculation.
