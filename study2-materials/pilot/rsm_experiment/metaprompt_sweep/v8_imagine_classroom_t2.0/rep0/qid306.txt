Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9 class of 30 students.

In my experience, the acronym **BIDMAS** (or BODMAS) is a double-edged sword. While students remember that 'M' and 'D' come before 'A' and 'S', many take the linear order of the acronym literally. This leads to the most common misconception in Year 9: believing that Addition *must* be performed before Subtraction simply because the letter 'A' precedes 'S' in the mnemonic.

**below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=30% D=50%**
These students (about 6 in the class) often hyper-fixate on the acronym. For Problem P, they see 'Addition' comes before 'Subtraction' in BIDMAS, so they stubbornly look for the addition first (\(5+6\)). For Problem Q, they know multiplication is 'stronger' than addition, but their cognitive load is high, and a few will still default to reading left-to-right.

**basic: A=05% B=30% C=20% D=45%**
These students (about 10 in the class) are getting better at spotting the multiplication in Problem Q. However, Problem P is their undoing. They have been taught BIDMAS so rigidly in Primary school that they find it physically uncomfortable to do a subtraction before an addition, even when moving left-to-right is the correct mathematical convention.

**proficient: A=00% B=70% C=05% D=25%**
These students (about 9 in the class) are starting to understand that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority. They remember me telling them "they are a team" and to work left-to-right. However, under the pressure of a quick quiz, a quarter of them will still revert to the "A before S" rule for Problem P.

**advanced: A=00% B=95% C=00% D=05%**
My top 5 students will breeze through this. The only reason one might pick D is through "overthinking"—rationalizing that because they are in an advanced set, there *must* be a trick requiring them to apply the acronym alphabetically.

**Summary of the distribution:**

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=30% D=50%
basic: A=05% B=30% C=20% D=45%
proficient: A=00% B=70% C=05% D=25%
advanced: A=00% B=95% C=00% D=05%
