In this Year 9 class, the presence of the number **0** is the ultimate distractor. Many students intuitively feel that zero "doesn't count," while others struggle with the notation of BIDMAS when a calculation is written in a single line.

**A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%**

**The Reasoning:**

*   **The "Zero is Nothing" Group (C):** Students like *Leo* and *Mia* will choose C. They know the formula is "sum divided by how many numbers there are," but they physically see four non-zero digits and their brain tells them they are finding the mean of four things. They think adding 0 doesn't change the total, so why divide by 5?
*   **The "Literal Calculator" Group (B):** Students like *Tyler* will pick B. He knows how to type it into a basic calculator. He doesn't realise that without brackets, BIDMAS means only the 7 is being divided by 5. He sees the correct digits in the correct order and stops thinking.
*   **The "Overthinkers" (D):** This will catch my higher-ability students like *Sarah*. She will spot that B is mathematically incorrect due to the lack of brackets, and she'll see that A is "missing" the 0 in the numerator. Even though $0+1+3+4+7$ is the same as $1+3+4+7$, she will argue that A is "incomplete" and therefore "None of them" must be the answer.
*   **The Confident Ones (A):** Those who understand that 0 is a data point that must be counted in the divisor, but doesn't affect the sum, will correctly identify A as the only mathematically sound expression.
