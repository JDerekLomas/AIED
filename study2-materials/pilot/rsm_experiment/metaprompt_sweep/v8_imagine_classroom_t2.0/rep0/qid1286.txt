Here is the predicted distribution and breakdown for my Year 9 class.

**below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=5% D=40%**
These students (like Chloe and Tyler) won’t actually try to rearrange the formula. They will look for a "maths-looking" answer. A significant portion will pick **A** because they remember the numbers $4, \pi, 3$ and assume they stay in the same orientation as the original formula ($4/3 \pi r^3$). Others will gravitate towards **D** because they see the fraction $3/4\pi$ separated from the $V$, and it "looks" like a solved equation to them, ignoring the cube root's placement.

**basic: A=20% B=20% C=25% D=35%**
These students (like Jack) know the formula $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$, but their algebra is shaky. The biggest hurdle here is the $4/3$. They’ll try to move the fraction and end up with $4V/3$ instead of $3V/4$ (leading them to **B**). **D** remains a massive "distractor" for this group because they often take the cube root of $V$ first and then try to deal with the coefficients, usually getting the division order wrong.

**proficient: A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%**
Students like Maya will get this right, but even here, the $4/3$ fraction is a "trip-wire." The 10% picking **B** are the ones who performed the steps correctly but panicked at the very last second and flipped the fraction the wrong way in their heads. Those picking **D** likely divided by $4\pi$ but forgot that the 3 must move to the numerator, or they applied the cube root only to the $V$ and not the whole expression.

**advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%**
Leo and Sarah will find this trivial. They have practiced subject rearrangement enough that they see the "cross-multiplication" of the 3 and the 4 almost instantly. They won't even look at the options until they've mentally moved the $\pi$ and the $4/3$ across the equals sign.
