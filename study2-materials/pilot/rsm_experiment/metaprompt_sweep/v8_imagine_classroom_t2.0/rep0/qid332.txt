To give you the most accurate prediction, I’m looking at my Year 9 seating plan. 

The **Advanced** bunch will pause, notice Katie hasn't multiplied the $-5$ by $3$, and correctly identify that only Tom is right. The **Proficient** group usually crushes two-step equations, but "Which of these is correct?" questions always make them second-guess their own methods. They often think, "Well, if it’s a multiple-choice question, maybe there's a trick where both are right."

The real battleground is the **Basic** group. These students are used to the rule "what you do to one side, you do to the other," but they apply it like a blunt instrument. When they see Katie’s "36", they'll think: *"12 times 3 is 36, that makes sense!"* They won't notice that Katie failed to multiply the constant. They love "Both" as an answer because it feels safe and inclusive.

My **Below Basic** group will likely pick Katie (B) because $x-15=36$ (the correct step) looks "harder" than Tom's step. Or, they’ll see Tom's $+5$ as "too simple" and assume Katie's multiplication is the "clever" way to start.

Here is my predicted distribution for my 30 students:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=10% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=25% D=0%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
