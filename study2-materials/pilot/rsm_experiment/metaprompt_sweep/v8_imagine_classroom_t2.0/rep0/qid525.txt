To give you the context of my Year 9s: they are a typical "middle set." Some are gaining confidence, while others still harbor a deep-seated resentment toward fractions from Year 7.

Here is how I predict my 30 students will distribute across the levels:
*   **Below Basic (6 students):** These are my "path of least resistance" learners.
*   **Basic (10 students):** They remember there is a process but often pick the "easiest" common denominator.
*   **Proficient (10 students):** Solid pupils who know the algorithm but sometimes miss the "mixed number" instruction.
*   **Advanced (4 students):** The ones who finished this in 10 seconds.

### The Breakdown of Errors:
*   **The "D" Trap (Below Basic):** These students (like Tyler or Chloe) will just add straight across. $2+2=4$ and $7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$. In their minds, "adding is adding," and they are relieved to see their answer as an option.
*   **The "A" Slip (Proficient):** Students like Sarah will do the hard work: $2.7 + 2.25 = 4.95$, convert it to $4 \frac{19}{20}$, and then convert that to $99/20$ because they’ve had "improper fractions" drilled into them for three years. They’ll ignore the "leave as a mixed number" instruction because they think improper is "more mathematical."
*   **The "C" Calculation Error (Basic):** They'll find a common denominator by multiplying $10 \times 4$ to get $40$. They'll likely mess up the numerator scaling or simply default to the largest-looking denominator if they feel overwhelmed.

### Predicted Answer Distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=30% B=60% C=10% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
