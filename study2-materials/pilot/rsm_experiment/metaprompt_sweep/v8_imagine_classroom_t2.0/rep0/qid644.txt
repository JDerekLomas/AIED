Here is the predicted distribution for your Year 9 class, based on typical misconceptions regarding negative numbers and algebraic expansion operations.

**Predictive Analysis:**
*   **The "Adders":** Students like *Leo* and *Chloe* will see the numbers $-1$ and $-4$ and instinctively perform an addition calculation. They know "two minuses make a plus" but apply it to the value $(-1) + (-4) = -5$ rather than the operation.
*   **The "Sign Forgetters":** Students like *Jack* will correctly identify that the operation is multiplication but will focus on the digits ($1 \times 4$) and then "guess" that since there are minuses in the brackets, the answer should look "maths-y" and stay negative.
*   **The "Proficient" trap:** Many middle-attaining students will correctly multiply and get $+4$, but about 10% will rush and choose $-4$ simply because they see the minus signs in the question and don't pause to apply the negative multiplication rule.
