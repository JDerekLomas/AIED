Here is the predicted distribution for a typical mixed-ability Year 9 class.

**The Narrative behind the numbers:**
Even though this is an "easy" addition, the classroom environment and the specific distractor options will trip students up. My **Below Basic** group (usually my Tier 3/4 intervention kids) will see the fractions and reflexively add everything, including the denominators—a classic "autopilot" error. My **Basic** group will likely calculate the correct value but fail to read the final instruction to leave it as a mixed number, leading them to Option B. The **Proficient** group might overthink it, trying to convert to improper fractions first and potentially making a calculation error, while the **Advanced** group will see the simplicity and select A immediately, provided they don't rush and fall for the B "improper fraction" trap.

**below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%**
*Reasoning: High "D" selection because these students add the bottom numbers ($5+5=10$) because they don't have the conceptual model of "parts of a whole." Some will pick C by adding every number they see ($2+1+1+2=6$; $5+5=10$, somehow getting to 18).*

**basic: A=45% B=35% C=5% D=15%**
*Reasoning: Significant "B" selection. These students know how to do the math, but they've been drilled so hard on "convert to improper fractions first" that they’ll get to $18/5$ and stop, ignoring the "Leave your answer as a mixed number" instruction.*

**proficient: A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%**
*Reasoning: Mostly correct, but a few "B" outliers who forget to convert back, and a couple of "D" selections from students who have a "Friday brain" moment and add the denominators.*

**advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%**
*Reasoning: Near perfect. The only errors here are from rushing and not reading the mixed number requirement.*
