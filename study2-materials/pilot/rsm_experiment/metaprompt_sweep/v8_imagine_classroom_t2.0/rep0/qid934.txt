Here is the predicted distribution based on typical Year 9 classroom misconceptions.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The Option A Trap (20):** These students are "formula hungry." They see the number 4 and the number 5 (from half of 10) and multiply them, or more commonly, they see $4x$, substitute $x=0$, but their brain glops it into "40" or they somehow think the answer must be larger than 10.
*   **The Option B Trap (3):** This is the "Number Pattern" group. They haven't solved the equation; they’ve looked at the table, assumed the $y$ row will decrease by 1 or some other linear common difference, and "3" feels like a mid-range starting number for a sequence.
*   **The Option D Trap (2.5):** These students successfully set $4(0) = 0$ but then divide 10 by 4 instead of 2. They see the coefficient "4" at the start of the equation and their eyes lock onto it as the primary divisor.
*   **The "Why it's tricky":** Most Year 9s are used to $y = mx + c$. Seeing $x$ and $y$ on the same side (implicit form) creates a "block" where they forget which number to divide by.
