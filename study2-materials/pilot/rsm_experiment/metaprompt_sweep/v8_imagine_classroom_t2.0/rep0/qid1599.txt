To give you the most accurate prediction, I’m categorising my class of 30 into their working levels. Year 9 is that "messy middle" year where they are transitionary—some are starting to see algebra as a structure, while others are still trying to solve it like arithmetic.

Here is how I expect my 30 students to perform, based on the common misconceptions (The "Up-Side-Down" error, the "Term Splitting" error, and the "Wait, where did that 4 come from?" error).

**below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%**
*(The 5 students in this group still struggle with the visual 'look' of algebra. Many will choose **B** because they feel the '4' needs to be repeated or balanced. Those choosing **D** are simply working left-to-right but get confused about which goes on top of the 'bus stop'. Some will pick **C** because they see a division sign and immediately link it to the first letter only, then just "tack on" the +4 at the end.)*

**basic: A=50% B=10% C=10% D=30%**
*(The 10 students here know division is a fraction line, but **D** is their massive pitfall. They have a "big number goes on top" mental block from primary school; because $(h+4)$ looks 'bigger' than $c$, they'll flip it. A few will still pick **C** because they lack the 'invisible bracket' awareness around denominator terms.)*

**proficient: A=85% B=0% C=5% D=10%**
*(The 12 students here are solid. The few who get it wrong will pick **D** purely through rushing or **C** because they are over-thinking the order of operations and assume the division 'happens' before the addition applies to the whole expression.)*

**advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%**
*(My top 3 students. For them, this isn't even a calculation; it’s a visual translation task. They will finish this in three seconds and look bored.)*
