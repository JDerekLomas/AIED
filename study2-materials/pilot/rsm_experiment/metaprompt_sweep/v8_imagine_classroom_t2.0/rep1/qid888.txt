Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9s based on their usual patterns of error with directed numbers and expanding brackets.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The Option D Trap:** This will be the most common mistake for my 'Basic' and 'Proficient' students. They correctly add $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$, but then they see the two minus signs in the original bracket and their brain defaults to "negative times negative equals negative" out of pure habit or fatigue. They focus on the $35$ and just stick a minus on it because the whole problem "feels" negative.
*   **The Option A Error:** This is for my students who are still shaky on negative addition. They will do $-5 + 7$ or $7 - 5$ because they think the signs "cancel out" in the middle term, or they'll just find the difference between 5 and 7.
*   **The Option C Error:** Usually a result of a student remembering "two negatives make a positive" but over-applying it to the addition part of the FOIL process as well as the multiplication.

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=0% D=20%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
