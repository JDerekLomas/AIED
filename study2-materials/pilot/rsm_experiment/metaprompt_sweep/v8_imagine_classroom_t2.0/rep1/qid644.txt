Here is the predicted distribution for your Year 9 class. 

Even though this is just a single step of the FOIL/Grid method, the combination of "negative x negative" and "multiplication vs addition" is a classic trap for this age group.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The "B" Group (The sign forgetters):** Students like *Leo* or *Mia* will see $1 \times 4$ and get $4$, but they either ignore the signs entirely or assume that because there are minus signs in the brackets, the result must stay negative.
*   **The "C" Group (The adders):** This is your biggest headache. Students like *Jake* will see the numbers $-1$ and $-4$, and their brain will switch to "combining" mode. They'll do $-1 - 4 = -5$ or $1 + 4 = 5$. 
*   **The "D" Group (The number line wanderers):** They know it's "combining" but get lost on the directed number line. They see two negatives and their brain shouts "addition!" but keeps the negative sign.
