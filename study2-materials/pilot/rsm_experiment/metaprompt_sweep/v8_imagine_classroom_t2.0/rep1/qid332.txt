To give you the predicted breakdown for a typical Year 9 class, I have to consider the common misconception regarding the **order of operations in reverse** (BIDMAS/SAMDIB) and how students handle denominators when multiplying across an equation.

**The "Tom" Logic (Option A):** Most students find this intuitive. They see "-5" and think "inverse operation: +5". This feels safe and follows the standard "balancing" method they were taught first.

**The "Katie" Logic (The Pitfall):** This is where the class splits. To a student, Katie’s move looks like a shortcut: "I'll multiply by 3 to get rid of the fraction." However, many forget that **every term** must be multiplied by 3. Because the equation isn't written as $\frac{x-5}{3} = 12$, Katie is mathematically incorrect.

**Predicting the Students:**
*   **The "Proficient" Group:** This is the danger zone. These students are confident enough to try "multiplying out the fraction" first but often skip the step of multiplying the $-5$. They will pick **C** because they *think* both methods are valid "ways in," and they want to support Katie's "alternative" strategy.
*   **The "Advanced" Group:** They will spot the lack of brackets or the fact that the 5 isn't part of the numerator. They’ll see Tom is the only one who didn't break a rule.
*   **The "Below Basic" Group:** Many will pick **B** or **C** because fractions scare them, and Katie’s method "makes the fraction go away" immediately, which feels like the "right" kind of progress.

basic: A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=10% D=0%
