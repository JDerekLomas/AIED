Based on my experience with Year 9, this is a classic "procedural vs. conceptual" trap. 

**Predicting the "Whys":**
*   **The "A" Trap:** This will be the most common mistake across the middle sets. Students see 3 and 12 and their brains instantly scream "4". Instead of dividing $\frac{1}{12}$ by 3, they will multiply $3 \times \frac{1}{12}$ or simply focus on the denominator. To them, "undoing the 3" feels like it should simplify the 12 down to 4.
*   **The "C" Trap:** These are my "autopilot" students. They see $3$ and $12$ and don't even look at the fraction bar. They solve $3p = 12$ because it’s the equation they *expected* to see.
*   **The "B" Success:** My proficient students will remember the rule: "to get $p$, divide by 3." They’ll set up $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$ and correctly calculate $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$.
*   **The "D" Distractor:** This usually catches the students who try to do something with $3^2$ or just pick a square number because it "looks like a math answer."

Here is my predicted distribution for my 30 students:

below_basic: A=50% B=10% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
