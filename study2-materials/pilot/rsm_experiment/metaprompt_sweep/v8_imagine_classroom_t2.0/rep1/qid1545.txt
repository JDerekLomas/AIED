Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30 students.

**Teacher's Reflection:**
The students who get this wrong won't be "guessing"—they will be over-applying rules they think they know. The biggest trap here is the visual symmetry. A huge portion of the class (especially my 'basic' learners) will see the same four numbers in the same order and conclude they must be equal without actually calculating. 

My 'proficient' students often fall into the "BIDMAS-lite" trap. They’ll correctly do $12 \div 4 = 3$ on the left (getting 11), but then they'll rush the right side. Many will instinctively add $8+12$ first because of the brackets, get 20, then see the $\div 4$ and correctly get 5. However, a specific group will see $8+12 \div 4$ and $ (8+12) \div 4$ and think "the brackets don't change anything" because they always associate division as something that happens 'after' the first number.

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=70% D=0%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=65% D=0%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=25% D=0%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
