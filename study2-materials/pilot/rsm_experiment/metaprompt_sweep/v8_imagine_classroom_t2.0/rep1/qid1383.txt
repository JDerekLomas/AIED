Here is the predicted breakdown for a typical Year 9 class, based on common misconceptions regarding negative bases and indices.

**below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=15% D=35%**
These students aren't thinking about powers; they are thinking about operations. They see $3$ and $4$ and instinctively multiply them. Those who remember a negative is involved will head for D (-12), while the others land on B (12). A few might remember that $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$ from a recent lesson but will guess the sign randomly.

**basic: A=25% B=5% C=65% D=5%**
This group understands that $k^4$ means $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$. However, they are stuck on the "a negative and a positive make a negative" rule from multiplication. They will calculate 81 correctly, but their inner voice tells them that because the input was $-3$, the answer *must* stay negative. They haven't yet internalised that an even power "cancels out" the negative sign.

**proficient: A=70% B=0% C=30% D=0%**
These students are strong but prone to "calculator brain." They know that $(-3)^4 = 81$. However, about a third of them will make the classic error of thinking about $-3^4$. In their heads, they do $3^4$ and then simply "tack" the minus sign back on at the end. They understand the math, but they lack the notation rigor to realise the negative is part of the base being repeated.

**advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%**
These students have been caught out by this trick before. They immediately identify that an even exponent results in a positive value when the base is negative. They see the trap, avoid it, and likely double-check that they didn't accidentally do $3 \times 4$ in a moment of madness.
