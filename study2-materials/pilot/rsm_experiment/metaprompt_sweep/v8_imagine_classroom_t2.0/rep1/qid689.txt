To predict this accurately, I have to consider the "proportionality trap." In Year 9, students see the numbers 10 and 5 and their brains immediately hunt for a relationship involving 2. The placement of the variable $p$ in the denominator is a classic "bottleneck" concept.

My **Lower Set (Below Basic)** will see $10$ and $5$ and immediately multiply them because they dislike fractions, leading them straight to 50. My **Middle Sets (Basic/Proficient)** will correctly identify that $10 \div 5 = 2$ or $5 \times 2 = 10$, but they will fail to rearrange the equation properly, assuming the larger number must be the numerator. They will pick $p=2$ with absolute confidence. Only the **Advanced** students will pause to realise that if the result is larger than the numerator, the denominator must be less than 1.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=30% D=0%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=65% D=0%
proficient: A=45% B=5% C=50% D=0%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
