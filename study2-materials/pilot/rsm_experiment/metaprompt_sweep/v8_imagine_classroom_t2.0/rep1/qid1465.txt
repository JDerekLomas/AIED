Here is the predicted distribution and analysis for my Year 9 class of 30.

**below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=30% D=50%**
These students (like Liam and Chloe) see "BIDMAS" as a rule that means "do exactly what is written from left to right, but skip ahead for multiplication." However, they usually default to a purely linear approach because "negative numbers are scary."
*   **The "D" logic:** They do $(3 - 5) + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$? No, they do $3 - 5 = -2$, then they ignore the sign and do $5+4=9$, $9 \times 2 = 18$... they get lost and eventually just calculate $(3-5+4) \times 2 = 2 \times 2 = 4$ or, more commonly, $(3-5) = -2$, and they add $4 \times 2$ but get the signs muddied, ending up with **D** by doing $5+5 \times 2$ incorrectly. Actually, the most common "Below Basic" error here is performing $3-9 \times 2$, getting $-12$ (C) or simply calculating linearly and making a sign error to get -10.

**basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%**
This group (like Tyler) remembers "Multiplication comes first" but struggles with the identity of the numbers left behind.
*   **The "B" logic:** They do $4 \times 2 = 8$. Then they write down $3 - 5 + 8$. They work left to right: $3 - 5 = -2$, and $-2 + 8 = 6$. Wait, they will get 6 (A) if they are careful, but many will do $5 + 8 = 13$ and then $3 - 13 = -10$ (D). They see the "plus" and assume the 5 and 8 must be joined before the 3 is touched. They treat the subtraction sign as a separator rather than a property of the 5.

**proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%**
Most of the middle-set (like Amelie) will navigate this correctly.
*   **The "A" logic:** They do $4 \times 2 = 8$, rewrite as $3 - 5 + 8$. They are comfortable with $3 - 5$ being $-2$, and then adding $8$ to reach $6$.
*   **Why they fail:** A few will still fall into the trap of doing $(3-5) + (4 \times 2) = -2 + 8$ but then accidentally subtracting the 8 from the 2 because they see "different signs" and get confused under pressure.

**advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%**
Students like Sam and Maya will find this trivial. They view the expression as three terms: $(+3)$, $(-5)$, and $(+8)$. They might even group it as $3 + 8 - 5$ to make it $11 - 5 = 6$ without a second thought.

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=30% D=50%

proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
