Here is the predicted distribution based on typical Year 9 classroom misconceptions.

**The Context:**
*   **The "0" Trap:** Students often struggle with $x=0$. Some will think the whole equation cancels to 0, while others see $2y = 10$ and solve instantly.
*   **The Variable Swappers:** Several students will substitute the $x$ value into the $y$ position, or vice versa, because they don't read the column headers carefully.
*   **The Additive Misconception:** Lower-ability students often see "4x + 2y = 10" and simply add $4 + 2$ to get 6, then try to figure out what $x$ or $y$ should be to reach 10 through addition rather than substitution.

**Predicted Results:**

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
*Reasoning:* These students see $x=0$ and assume the first term is just $0$. They then see $+ 2y = 10$ and simply pick **C (5)** because $5 \times 2 = 10$. However, many will pick **B (3)** because they mistakenly think the "4" from $4x$ needs to be added to something to get 10, or they perform $10 - 4 - 2 = 4 \div 2 \dots$ confusing their operations entirely.

basic: A=5% B=15% C=75% D=5%
*Reasoning:* Most of these students will correctly identify that when $x=0$, $4(0)=0$. They are comfortable with the one-step equation $2y = 10$ and will gravitate toward **C**. Those who miss it (**B**) are usually trying to do a "pattern" in their head for a linear graph without calculating the first term first.

proficient: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
*Reasoning:* These students find this easy but occasionally fall for "speed traps." A student picking **D** likely divided 10 by 4 instead of 10 by 2, thinking $y=0$. A student picking **B** might be looking ahead at the $x=1$ column and getting their wires crossed.

advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
*Reasoning:* This is a "free point" for the top of the class. They will instantly identify this as the y-intercept where $x=0$ and solve the linear equation in their head.
