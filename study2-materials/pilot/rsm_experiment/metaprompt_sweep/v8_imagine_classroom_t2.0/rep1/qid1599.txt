In this Year 9 class, the main hurdles are "visual clutter" and the common habit of reading left-to-right without considering the priority of the fraction bar as a grouping symbol. 

**The Analysis:**
*   **The "Swappers" (D):** These are my mid-attaining students (basic/proficient) who know that division looks like a fraction, but they often put the "heavier" expression on the top because it "looks right" or they simply mix up dividend and divisor.
*   **The "Left-to-Right" Group (C):** These students (below basic) treat the calculation as a linear sequence. They see $c \div h$ and write it as a fraction, then just "tack on" the $+4$ at the end, completely ignoring the parentheses. 
*   **The "Over-Simplifiers" (B):** This is a specific niche of student who feels like a term is "missing" or "unfair," so they try to balance the fraction by adding the $+4$ to both top and bottom.

**The Predicted Distribution:**

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=5% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=0% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
