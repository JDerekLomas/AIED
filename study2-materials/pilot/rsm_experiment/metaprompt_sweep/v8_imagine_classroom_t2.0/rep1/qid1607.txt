Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 class based on my experience with how they handle multi-step algebraic rearranging.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
The "trap" in this question isn't Step 1 (which most find intuitive); it’s the transition to Step 2. Even "good" students often work on autopilot. In Step 1, they see a division and correctly think "multiply." In Step 2, they see the number $1$ and the number $60$ and their brain shortcuts to $60+1=61$ simply because they see a plus sign on the right-hand side, forgetting they must perform the **inverse** operation to move the constant.

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the very first step. They see the 15, 1, and 4 and try to do something like $15 - 1$ first. They often pick **D** because the whole thing looks confusing, or **C** because they trust the "printed" math more than their own.
*   **Basic:** This is where the **C** peak happens. These students can successfully follow Step 1, but they have a "signs" weakness. They see $+1$ and instinctively add 1 to 60 because they don't consciously process the balance method; they just pair the numbers together.
*   **Proficient:** These students are your "A" choosers. They are confident enough to spot that Step 2 is wrong (recognising it should be $60-1=59$), but they have enough algebraic foundation to see that Step 1 is a perfectly valid first move.
*   **Advanced:** They will cruise through this, though 5% might fall into the "autopilot trap" if they are rushing to finish first.

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
