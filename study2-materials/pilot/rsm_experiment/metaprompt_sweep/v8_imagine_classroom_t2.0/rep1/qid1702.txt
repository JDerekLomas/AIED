To give you the context of my prediction: I know this class. Even my stronger students often see a table and immediately assume they are solving for $y$ because that’s the "standard" routine. This question flips the script by giving $y = 0.5$ and asking for $x$.

**The predicted mindset:**
*   **The "Subtracters" (C):** A significant number of students will treat the $0.5$ as something to subtract from $3$ or simply perform $3.3 \div 1$ because they get confused by the 10 and 6. 
*   **The "Sign Flippers" (B):** They will correctly move the 3 over, but mess up the negative sign handling in the middle of their working out.
*   **The "Calculation Errors" (D):** These students correctly get to $10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33$, but then their mental division falters, or they get distracted by the $0.3$ versus $0.7$ decimal logic.

Here is the predicted distribution for my 30 Year 9s:

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=45% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
