To predict this distribution, I have to consider the specific hurdles of Year 9: the battle with "sign fatigue" and the difference between an additive inverse (which makes zero) and a multiplicative inverse (which makes one).

Even my higher-ability students often rush through the signs because they find the fraction arithmetic "too easy," while my struggling students see a minus sign and a fraction and immediately start guessing or trying to "cancel out" the negativity.

**below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%**
*Reasoning:* These students see a negative sign in the question and feel they "need" a positive to make the -1 stay negative. A significant chunk will choose C because they want to "leave the sign alone." They treat multiplication like addition, thinking they just need the same number to reach a "1" of some sort.

**basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%**
*Reasoning:* This group knows about reciprocals. They know the numbers 3 and 4 have to flip. However, they are highly prone to the "balance" error (Option A). They think: "Negative times Positive equals Negative," which is a rule they've memorised, so they pick the positive fraction because the answer is negative. They overlook that it needs to be *positive* 1 for the reciprocal rule they practiced to be straightforward.

**proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%**
*Reasoning:* These students are the ones who get caught by the "too much information" trap. They know it’s B, but at least a quarter of them will overthink it and select A. They’ll tell me after the lesson: "Sir, I thought because the answer was negative, only one of the numbers could be negative!" They apply the rule correctly but forget the question already provided the minus sign for the first term.

**advanced: A=5% B=95% C=0% D=0%**
*Reasoning:* My top-end students will spot the identity immediately. The 5% mistake on A is purely a "silly mistake" or a clicking error because they did the mental math faster than their hand could move.
