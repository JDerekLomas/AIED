To give you the most accurate prediction, I’m categorising my class of 30 into four working levels: **Below Basic** (those struggling with foundation concepts), **Basic** (confident with whole numbers but shaky on fractions), **Proficient** (solid grade 4/5 potential), and **Advanced** (the high-flyers).

### The "Why" behind the errors:
*   **The Option D Trap:** This is the most common Year 9 error. Students like Leo and Sarah will simply add the "tops and bottoms" ($2+2=4$, $7+1=8$, $10+4=14$). It feels intuitive and fast, so they won’t stop to think about common denominators.
*   **The Option A Trip-up:** My conscientious students like Marcus will convert to improper fractions first ($\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4}$) and correctly find $\frac{99}{20}$. However, Marcus often rushes the final step and fails to read the instruction: *"Leave your answer as a mixed number."* He sees his numerical result matches A and clicks it immediately.
*   **The Option C Confusion:** A few students will find a common denominator by multiplying $10 \times 4$ to get $40$, but then forget to adjust the numerators correctly, or get bogged down in the double-digit multiplication and pick C because the denominator looks "right."

### The Predicted Distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=10% B=90% C=0% D=0%
