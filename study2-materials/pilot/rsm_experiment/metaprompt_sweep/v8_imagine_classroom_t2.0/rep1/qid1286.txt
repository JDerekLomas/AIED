Here is the predicted distribution and my teacher’s intuition on why your Year 9s will respond this way.

**The "Teacher Instinct" Analysis:**
*   **The Root Cause:** Year 9s often treat algebraic rearrangement as a "jumble" rather than a logical sequence. Many will identify that $3$, $4$, and $\pi$ are involved, but they will mix up the "who goes where" of the fraction.
*   **Option A:** This is the trap for my "impatient" students. They know the formula involves $4/3$ and $\pi$. They see those numbers grouped together in a fraction and stop thinking, ignoring that the $3$ should move from the denominator to the numerator during the move across the equals sign.
*   **Option B:** This attracts the students who remember that $\pi$ usually lives "next to" the 4, so when they divide, they take the whole $4\pi$ block downstairs, forgetting to flip the $3$ upwards.
*   **Option D:** This is for the students who haven't mastered indices/roots yet. They might try to cube root $V$ first then multiply by the constants because they aren't comfortable with the root symbol covering the entire expression.

**The Predicted Distribution:**

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=95% D=0%

**Teacher Notes on Specific Student Groups:**
*   **The "Below Basic" group** will look for the option that looks most like the original formula they (half) remember. They see $4\pi$ on top in the volume formula, so they choose A or B because it "looks right."
*   **The "Proficient" group** understands they need to multiply by $3$ and divide by $4\pi$. However, a good chunk will make a "signage" error and move the $4$ and the $3$ together as a single block (Option B).
*   **The "Advanced" group** will quickly sketch $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ and solve it systematically, though 1 in 20 will still make a silly "pen slip" error and pick B.
