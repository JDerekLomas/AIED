Here is my prediction based on the common misconceptions I see in my Year 9 classroom. Even for the stronger students, decimal place value combined with squaring often causes a "slip."

**The Logic Behind the Errors:**
*   **A (0.81):** This is the "Confident Calculator" error. Students like *Leo* will square both the $3$ and the $0.3$. They see $3^2=9$ and $0.3^2=0.09$, then multiply them (or just do $(3 \times 0.3)^2$), forgetting BIDMAS and that the $3$ isn't inside a bracket.
*   **B (0.27):** This is the most common mistake for my mid-range students. They correctly identify $3^2 = 9$ and $3 \times 9 = 27$, but their "decimal intuition" is weak. They see one decimal place in the question ($0.3$), so they assume there must be exactly one decimal place in the answer. They feel $0.09$ looks "too small."
*   **C (1.8):** This is for my students like *Jack*, who are still stuck on the difference between $x^2$ and $2x$. He will do $0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$, then $3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$. 
*   **D (2.7):** The correct answer ($3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$). This requires the student to navigate BIDMAS and understand that squaring a decimal between 0 and 1 makes it smaller, moving it into the hundredths column.
