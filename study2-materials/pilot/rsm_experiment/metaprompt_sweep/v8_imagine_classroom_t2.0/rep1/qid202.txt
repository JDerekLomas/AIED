Here is the predicted distribution for my Year 9 class of 30, based on their typical misconceptions with mixed number addition and fractions.

**The "Why" behind the errors:**
*   **The Option B Trap (The Over-Thinkers):** My mid-to-high ability students (Proficient/Advanced) will often default to the "improper fraction method" ($ \frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5} $). Despite the question explicitly asking for a mixed number, several will rush, see their numerical result in Option B, and circle it instantly without converting back.
*   **The Option D Trap (The "Add Everything" Mistake):** My "Basic" level students often view fractions as four independent whole numbers. They will add the integers ($2+1=3$) and then add the numerators ($1+2=3$) *and* the denominators ($5+5=10$). This "top + top, bottom + bottom" logic is the most persistent misconception in Year 9.
*   **Option C:** Only my weakest students will choose this; it occurs when they forget the whole numbers entirely and focus only on the fractions, adding the denominators out of habit.

**The predicted distribution:**

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=70% B=25% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=10% C=0% D=0%
