Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30 students.

**Teacher's Insight:**
*   **The Zero Trap:** This is the primary hurdle. "Below basic" and "Basic" students often treat zero as "nothing," meaning it doesn't need to be added (A) or shouldn't be counted in the divisor (C).
*   **The Calculator/BIDMAS Trap:** Students who rely on a linear scientific calculator often type "0+1+3+4+7 $\div$ 5" exactly as written, forgetting that the calculator will divide 7 by 5 first. They will see Option B and recognize their own typing pattern.
*   **The Pedant Trap:** Advanced students will spot that Option A is mathematically correct because $0 + x = x$. However, a significant portion of them will overthink Option B's lack of brackets or look for a "perfect" version including the zero, potentially leading them to D.

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=30% D=0%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
