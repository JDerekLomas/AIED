Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class of 30 students.

In my experience, the "BIDMAS trap" is the primary driver here. Students who have over-learned the acronym often believe addition *must* come before subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S'. Meanwhile, the left-to-right rule for equal priority operations is often forgotten by all but the top-end students.

**Below Basic (approx. 5 students):**
These students often operate on "vibes" or a very literal reading of the acronym. They will see "Plus" and "Times" and assume addition always happens first because it's "easier" or they are scanning for the first operator they like.
**below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%**

**Basic (approx. 10 students):**
This group is the most dangerous. They remember BIDMAS as a rigid ladder. To them, $5+6$ MUST happen before $4-5$ because A is before S. They have a solid grasp of Multiplication over Addition (Problem Q), but will confidently pick the wrong first step for Problem P.
**basic: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%**

**Proficient (approx. 10 students):**
These students are starting to realise that $+$ and $-$ have equal priority. However, under the pressure of a quick-fire question, about half of them will still fall into the "Addition first" trap because they haven't yet mastered the left-to-right "tie-break" rule.
**proficient: A=10% B=50% C=0% D=40%**

**Advanced (approx. 5 students):**
These students know that Addition and Subtraction are inverse operations and you simply work left to right. They will see through the distractor (D) immediately.
**advanced: A=10% B=90% C=0% D=0%**
