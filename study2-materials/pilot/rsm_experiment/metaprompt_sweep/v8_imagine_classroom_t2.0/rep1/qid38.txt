To give you my prediction for my Year 9s, I have to look at the "classic" misconceptions. 

**Option B** is the most popular wrong answer for students who lack confidence with fractions; they simply add across the top ($3+4$) and across the bottom ($2x+x$). 

**Option D** is the "half-way house" error; these students recognise the need for a common denominator and pick $2x$, but they forget to adjust the numerator of the second fraction, leaving it as $3 + 4$ over $2x$.

**Option A** is the correct answer ($3/2x + 8/2x$).

Here is the predicted distribution for a typical Year 9 mixed-ability class:

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=0% D=10%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
