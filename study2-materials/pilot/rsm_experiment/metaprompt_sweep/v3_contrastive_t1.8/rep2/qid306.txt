This question addresses two major aspects of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Problem Q is a standard test of multiplication before addition. Problem P is the "hidden" trap: many students believe the "A" (Addition) comes before "S" (Subtraction) in BIDMAS, leading them to do $5+6$ first, whereas the rule is to work from left to right when only addition and subtraction remain.

In my experience, **Problem P** is the much more frequent "false friend." While even lower-ability students are starting to remember "Multiply before Add," a very large number of proficient students still believe Addition must precede Subtraction because of the literal order of the letters in BIDMAS. This makes **D** a very attractive distractor for mid-to-high ability students, while **B** is the correct answer. **A** is the common mistake for those who ignore BIDMAS entirely and work left-to-right on everything.

basic: A=30% B=25% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
advanced: A=2% B=85% C=1% D=12%
