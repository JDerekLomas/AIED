This question is a significant "trap" for students at the Lower-Secondary (KS3) and GCSE levels because it combines two common areas of difficulty: the order of operations (BIDMAS) and decimal multiplication.

The primary error students make is multiplying $3 \times 0.3$ first to get $0.9$, then squaring it to get $0.81$ (Option A). This is a classic violation of BIDMAS/indices rules. The second most common error is misplacing the decimal point when squaring $0.3$; students frequently believe $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, leading to $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ (Option D). Option B represents the correct calculation: $3 \times (0.3^2) = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

In the UK school context:
- **Below Basic** students often choose A because "multiply then square" feels like a natural left-to-right process, or C by simply ignoring the square and calculating $3 \times 0.3 \times 2$.
- **Basic** students often struggle with the decimal $0.3^2$. Many think it is $0.9$. Therefore, they calculate $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$.
- **Proficient** students understand BIDMAS but are still susceptible to the decimal slip ($0.3^2 = 0.9$).
- **Advanced** students have mastered both the order of operations and decimal place value.
