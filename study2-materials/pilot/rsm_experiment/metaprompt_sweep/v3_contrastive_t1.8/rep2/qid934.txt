As a UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because it tests "substitution into an implicit equation." While the calculation itself is simple, the presentation $4x + 2y = 10$ is more challenging for students than the more common $y = mx + c$ format.

**Key insights for this question:**
1.  **The $x=0$ advantage:** Since students are asked for the value when $x=0$, the $4x$ term effectively "disappears." Many students will intuitively realise they just need to solve $2y=10$.
2.  **The "5" trap (Option C):** This is the correct answer and is quite accessible. Even students with weak algebraic skills can often see that $2 \times 5 = 10$.
3.  **Misconception A (20):** Students who multiply $4 \times 5$ (perhaps seeing the $4$ and the target $10$ and getting confused with factors/multiples) or try to "move" the 2 incorrectly.
4.  **Misconception B (3):** Some students might subtract the 4 from 10 to get 6, then divide by 2.
5.  **Misconception D (2.5):** This is a very common error where students divide the total ($10$) by the coefficient of $x$ ($4$) instead of the coefficient of $y$.

Despite the implicit form, the $x=0$ case is the easiest possible entry point for this table, meaning most "proficient" students will not struggle.
