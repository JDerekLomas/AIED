As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this question as one that tests fraction manipulation within one-step equations. 

The most common trap here is Option A ($p=\frac{1}{4}$), where students see "3" and "12" and instinctively perform $12 \div 3$. Option C is for students who multiply $12 \times 3$ but lose the fractional structure or mistakenly believe $p$ must be a whole number. Option D represents a misunderstanding of the denominator, perhaps thinking they should subtract from 12 or multiply by 3 but failing to calculate correctly. Option B is the correct result of dividing $\frac{1}{12}$ by 3 (or multiplying by $\frac{1}{3}$).

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=92% C=1% D=2%
