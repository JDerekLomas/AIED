This question tests a student's ability to translate division into fraction notation, specifically involving a bracketed expression (the divisor). While the concept is foundational, the placement of brackets is the key differentiator here.

**Analysis:**
- **The Correct Answer (A):** Direct translation of dividend to numerator and divisor to denominator.
- **The "Over-Distribution" Trap (B):** This targets students who have a vague memory that "the number outside the bracket affects everything," incorrectly applying it by repeating the $+4$ in the numerator.
- **The "BODMAS/Formatting" Trap (C):** This is a very common error. Students who ignore the importance of the bracket or write the fraction bar too short often associate the division only with the term immediately following it ($c/h$), then add the 4 separately.
- **The "Reversal" Trap (D):** A classic confusion between dividend and divisor, often seen in students who think "the bigger expression goes on top" or simply mix up the order.

**Student Performance Prediction:**
- **Below Basic:** These students often guess or pick D because $h+4$ looks "heavier" and should therefore be on top, or C because it looks like a linear string of operations.
- **Basic:** Students at this level know division becomes a fraction bar but often struggle with where the bracketed terms end up. C is a very "attractive" wrong answer here because it looks like the division was performed first ($c \div h$).
- **Proficient:** Most should get this right, though some may rush and select C if they don't value the "grouping" nature of the fraction bar.
- **Advanced:** This is a 10-second question for an advanced student. Error rates will be negligible and likely due to clerical slips.

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=55% B=10% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=3% C=10% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
