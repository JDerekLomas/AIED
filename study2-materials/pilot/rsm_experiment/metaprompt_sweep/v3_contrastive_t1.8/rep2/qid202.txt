As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this question as being on the "easier" side of fraction addition because the denominators are the same and the sum of the fractional parts does not exceed a whole (no regrouping/carrying required).

The main pitfalls here are:
1.  **Option D (The "Add Everything" Error):** Students at lower ability levels often add the numerators AND the denominators ($5+5=10$).
2.  **Option B (The Format Error):** The calculation $\frac{18}{5}$ is mathematically correct, but the prompt explicitly asks for a "mixed number." Proficient students might overlook this, but advanced students rarely do.
3.  **Option C (The Double Error):** Combining the incorrect denominator logic with an error in whole number/numerator handling.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
