In this equation, Step 1 is correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$). However, Step 2 contains a very common algebraic error: instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$, the student has added it ($60 + 1 = 61$).

For **below_basic** students, the sight of "61" looks like a natural progression from 60 and 1, and many will believe both steps are correct because they aren't confident with inverse operations. **Basic** level students often identify that the first step is right, but they frequently fail to spot the sign error in the second step, leading many to choose C. **Proficient** students are usually the ones this question "catches out" the most; they can solve the equation themselves, but when checking someone else's work, they often skim the arithmetic and see "$60, 1, 61$" as a valid family of numbers, only realizing it's an error if they look closely at the operation. **Advanced** students will quickly identify that Step 2 should be $k=59$.

The "trap" here is that Step 1 is a relatively sophisticated start (clearing the fraction), which makes the student's work look "intelligent," leading lower-ability peers to trust the subsequent (incorrect) arithmetic.
