This question tests two distinct concepts simultaneously: the multiplicative inverse (reciprocals) and the rules for multiplying negative numbers.

While many students know that a number times its reciprocal equals $1$, the target here is $-1$. This creates a "sign trap." Students who instinctively look for the reciprocal will see $\frac{4}{3}$ and may select Option A without checking the sign. Students who over-correct for the negative sign might choose B, thinking $(-)\times(-)=(+)$, and thus accidentally produce $+1$ instead of $-1$.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level often struggle with fractions and signs. Many will choose C or D simply because they contain the same numbers as the question, or A because they recognise the "flip" but ignore the signs.
*   **Basic:** These students often know that a fraction "flipped" is involved, but they frequently conflate the rules for "reciprocal" (product is 1) with "negative reciprocal" (used in perpendicular lines) or simply forget that a negative times a positive is a negative. Option B is a very strong distractor here.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually perform the calculation accurately. They recognise that to keep the product negative, they must multiply by a positive. The main error here is rushing and selecting B because they associate reciprocals with "same sign."
*   **Advanced:** Almost all should get this right. They will mentally check $(-\frac{3}{4}) \times (\frac{4}{3}) = -\frac{12}{12} = -1$.
