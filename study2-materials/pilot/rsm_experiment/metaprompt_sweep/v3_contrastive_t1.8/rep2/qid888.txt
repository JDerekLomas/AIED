As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this quadratic expansion by looking at two specific pitfalls: the "negative multiplied by a negative" rule for the constant term and the "sum of negatives" for the linear term.

**The Challenges:**
1.  **The constant term ($+35$):** This is the biggest separator. Basic and below-basic students frequently associate two minus signs in the brackets with a minus sign in the result ($-5 \times -7 = -35$), leading them to options A or D.
2.  **The middle term ($-12m$):** While some might perform $-7 + 5$ incorrectly to get $-2$ (Option A), most students recognize that 5 and 7 combine to 12. The issue for mid-range students is usually the sign of that 12.
3.  **Option B vs C:** Option C is a common "low-concentration" error where students see two negatives and decide "two minuses make a plus" applies to everything, including the middle term.

**Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often pick D because they correctly get 12 but follow the "gut feeling" that a subtraction-heavy question should end in a minus.
*   **Basic:** This group struggles most with the $-5 \times -7$ rule. They often narrow it down to B or D and flip a coin on the final sign.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually have the method (FOIL/Grid) down. Errors are usually "slip" errors regarding the middle term sign (Option C).
*   **Advanced:** Should find this trivial; the only errors would be extreme overconfidence resulting in a misclick.

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%
