To predict how students will perform on this question, we must look at the specific common errors associated with algebraic fractions.

**Option A ($\frac{11}{2x}$)** is the correct answer. The common denominator is $2x$, so $\frac{4}{x}$ becomes $\frac{8}{2x}$. Adding $3 + 8$ gives $11$.
**Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$)** is the classic "add the tops, add the bottoms" error. This is a very common instinctive mistake for lower-ability students.
**Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$)** occurs when students recognise they need a common denominator of $2x$, but they forget to multiply the numerator of the second fraction (calculating $3 + 4$ instead of $3 + 8$).
**Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$)** is a less common error where students might double the first fraction's numerator but lose the denominator's coefficient, or simply miscalculate the denominator entirely.

This question is moderately difficult because the denominators are not identical ($x$ and $2x$), but it is "kinder" than some because one denominator is a direct multiple of the other, avoiding the need for a $2x^2$ denominator.

**Ability Level Breakdown:**

*   **Below Basic:** These students struggle with the fundamental concept of common denominators. A significant portion will simply add the numerators and denominators (Option B).
*   **Basic:** These students know they need a common denominator but often make "partial" errors. They are the most likely group to choose Option D, forgetting to scale the numerator of the second fraction.
*   **Proficient:** These students generally handle the process well but may make a silly arithmetic error or a slight slip in notation. Most should reach Option A.
*   **Advanced:** At this level, this is a standard procedural question that should be answered correctly almost 100% of the time.
