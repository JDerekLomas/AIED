This question is a classic test of the hierarchy of operations and "clearing the fraction" in two-step equations. 

**Tom** follows the standard classroom procedure: adding 5 to both sides first ($12 + 5 = 17$). Most students, even those who struggle with algebra, recognize this as the "usual" first step.

**Katie** attempts to multiply by 3 first. This is a common point of failure. To correctly multiply by 3, she would need to multiply *every* term, resulting in $x - 15 = 36$. Her error ($x - 5 = 36$) is the quintessential mistake made by students who do not understand that the denominator 3 only applies to the $x$ and not the $-5$.

**Prediction Rationale:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will see Katie’s $12 \times 3 = 36$ and think it looks right, often choosing "Both" because they assume there are multiple ways to solve it and both numbers ($17$ and $36$) come from valid-looking operations ($+5$ and $\times 3$).
*   **Basic:** Most will recognize Tom is correct. However, a significant number will still be "tricked" by Katie because they often forget to multiply the constant term when clearing a fraction.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually have a solid grasp of the standard two-step method (A). They are trained to look for the error in Katie’s method, though a few might still fall for the "it looks plausible" trap.
*   **Advanced:** These students will immediately spot that Katie failed to distribute the multiplication to the $-5$ and will confidently select A.
