As an experienced UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on common classroom observations regarding fraction arithmetic. 

The question involves adding mixed numbers with different denominators. 
*   **The Trap (Option D):** This is the classic "add the tops, add the bottoms" error ($2+2=4$, $7+1=8$, $10+4=14$). Lower-ability students are highly prone to this.
*   **The Conversion Trap (Option A):** This is the correct answer mathematically, but the prompt explicitly asks for a **mixed number**. High-ability students often miss this instruction in their haste, while lower-ability students rarely convert to improper fractions correctly anyway.
*   **The Denominator Error (Option C):** This represents students who convert correctly but multiply the denominators (40) without adjusting the numerators properly or fail to simplify.
*   **The Correct Path (Option B):** Finding a common denominator of 20 leads to $2 \frac{14}{20} + 2 \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=10% B=88% C=1% D=1%
