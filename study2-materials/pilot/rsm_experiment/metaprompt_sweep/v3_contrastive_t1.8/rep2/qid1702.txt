To solve this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$ and solve for $x$:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$

**Analysis of Difficulties:**
1.  **Algebraic Manipulation (The most likely error):** Students often struggle with signs when moving terms. If a student calculates $10x + 3 = 30$, they get $10x = 27$, leading to $x = 2.7$ (Option D). This is the most common trap.
2.  **Substitution Confusion:** Some students may swap the $x$ and $y$ values, putting $x = 0.5$ into the equation ($5 - 6y = 30$, leading to a negative result), though the table layout makes this less likely.
3.  **Arithmetic Errors:** Calculating $6 \times 0.5$ is usually straightforward, but under pressure, students sometimes perform $6 - 0.5 = 5.5$ or $6 \div 0.5 = 12$. Option A ($4.25$) corresponds to an error like $10x - 12.5 = 30$, which is less logical, but it serves as a "distractor" for those who simply guess or mess up the decimal placement.
4.  **Strength of Distractor D:** Option D is a very "strong" distractor because it tests the common mistake of adding rather than subtracting when "moving" a term across the equals sign (or vice-versa).
