This question tests a student's ability to rearrange a formula involving a cube root, specifically the formula for the volume of a sphere ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$).

While the formula is provided in the GCSE formula sheet (for most exam boards), many students struggle with the algebraic manipulation required to isolate $r$. The most common errors involve:
1. **Incorrectly moving the fraction**: Multiplying by 4 and dividing by 3 (Option B) instead of multiplying by 3 and dividing by 4.
2. **Placing $\pi$ in the numerator**: Students often associate $\pi$ with the "top" of the formula and fail to divide by it correctly (Option A).
3. **Improper use of the radical**: Applying the cube root only to the $V$ or neglecting it entirely (Option D).

**Below Basic** students often guess or choose the option that looks most like the original formula without performing the inverse operations. **Proficient** students usually handle the $\frac{3}{4}$ correctly but may occasionally misplace the $\pi$. **Advanced** students should solve this reliably, though under time pressure, a few may flip the fraction.
