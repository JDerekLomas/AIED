As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this question by focusing on two primary hurdles: the inclusion of '0' in a data set and the correct use of BIDMAS/order of operations in horizontal notation.

The "trap" here is that while Option A is numerically correct (adding zero doesn't change the sum), many students fail to distinguish it from Option B. Option B is a classic "calculator error" where the division only applies to the last number. Advanced students will spot that Option B lacks brackets, making it mathematically incorrect despite the intention. Below-basic students often treat '0' as "nothing," leading them to divide by 4 (Option C), which is the most common misconception with the mean.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=50% D=5%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=85% B=5% C=2% D=8%
