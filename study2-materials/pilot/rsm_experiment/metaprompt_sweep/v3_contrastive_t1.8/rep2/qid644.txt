As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen that many students struggle with expanding brackets not because they don't know the "FOIL" or grid method, but because they treat the algebraic process and the integer arithmetic as two separate tasks.

In this specific question, the "traps" are twofold: 
1. **The Negative Signs**: This is the classic $(-1) \times (-4)$ hurdle. Students at lower ability levels often ignore the signs entirely or remember "a minus and a minus make a plus" but apply it inconsistently. 
2. **Operation vs. Calculation**: A common misconception is to add the terms instead of multiplying them ($-1 - 4 = -5$ or $-1 + -4 = -5$). Because the question specifically asks what Molly gets when she *multiplies* the terms, it reduces this error for stronger students, but "below basic" students often default to addition when they see two small integers in a bracket.

Option B is the most common "proficient" error (forgetting that a negative times a negative is a positive), while Option D is the classic "adding instead of multiplying" error seen in lower-attaining groups.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0% D=1%
