This question is a classic test of the "Order of Operations" hierarchy vs. "Left to Right" execution. 

In **Problem P**, the "addition comes before subtraction" (A before S in BIDMAS/BODMAS) misconception is a powerful distractor. Many students incorrectly believe they must perform $5+6$ before subtracting from $4$. 

In **Problem Q**, most students identify that multiplication comes before addition. However, lower-ability students still tend to work purely from left to right.

The specific trap here is the interaction between the two problems. Option D is the "double misconception" choice (Addition first in P, Multiplication first in Q). Option B is the mathematically correct choice (Left-to-right for P, Multiplication first for Q).

**below_basic:** This group is likely to work left-to-right on everything (Option A) or strictly follow the letter-order of BIDMAS, seeing the 'A' before 'S' (Option D).
**basic:** Many have learned "multiplication first" (Problem Q) but are still trapped by the "addition before subtraction" rule in Problem P. This makes D a very high-frequency wrong answer for this group.
**proficient:** These students usually recognise that $5 \times 6$ comes first, but a significant portion will still fall for the $5+6$ trap in Problem P because of how BODMAS is memorised.
**advanced:** Most understand that addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be done left-to-right.

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=5% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=5% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=55% C=2% D=38%
advanced: A=1% B=92% C=0% D=7%
