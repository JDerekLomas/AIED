As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen this specific problem type trip up students because it tests three distinct areas: the inclusion of zero in the count, BIDMAS (Order of Operations), and the definition of a mean calculation.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **A is the correct answer.** Most students know they need to add the numbers and divide by how many there are ($5$). Even though adding $0$ doesn't change the sum, the denominator must reflect that $0$ is a data point.
*   **Option B** is the classic "calculator trap." Students often type this exactly as written into a non-fraction calculator, which results in $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + (7 \div 5)$.
*   **Option C** represents the most common conceptual error: "Ignoring the zero." Students often think that because the $0$ has no value, it doesn't count as a "number" in the set, leading them to divide by $4$.
*   **Option D** is a safety net for students who are confused by the missing $0$ in the numerator of A (even though it's mathematically equivalent).

**The Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often forget to count the zero and lean towards C, or pick B because it "looks" like the addition they do in their heads followed by a division sign.
*   **Basic:** They know to divide by 5, but many get nervous that the $0$ isn't written in the sum in option A, leading some to pick D.
*   **Proficient:** Usually identify that A is correct because $1+3+4+7$ is the same as $0+1+3+4+7$. However, some still fall for the "ignore the zero" rule if they aren't paying close attention.
*   **Advanced:** Will instantly recognise that adding $0$ is identity and $5$ is the correct divisor. They will spot the BIDMAS error in B immediately.

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=55% B=15% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
