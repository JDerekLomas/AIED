This question is a classic test of expanding double brackets with negative terms. The primary "traps" here are the arithmetic of directed numbers: $-5 + -7 = -12$ (the linear term) and $-5 \times -7 = +35$ (the constant term). 

Many **below_basic** students struggle with the double negative product, often choosing Option D because they see two minus signs in the question and assume the answer must end in a minus. Some also subtract the digits (7 - 5) to get 2, leading them to Option A. 

**Basic** level students usually know how to use the FOIL method or grid method but frequently make the sign error on the final term (thinking a negative times a negative is a negative), making Option D the most popular distractor for this group.

**Proficient** students have generally mastered the directed number rules but may still make a "slip" under pressure, though the majority will correctly identify that both signs in the expansion are influenced by the two negatives in the brackets.

**Advanced** students will see this as a standard procedural task and should rarely make a mistake.

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=55% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%
