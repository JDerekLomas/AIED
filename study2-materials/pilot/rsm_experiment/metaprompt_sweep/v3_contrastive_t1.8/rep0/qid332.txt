This question is a classic test of the hierarchy of operations and "clearing the fraction" in linear equations. It addresses a specific common error: when students multiply by the denominator (to "get rid of the divide by 3") without multiplying every term in the equation.

Tom's method is the "standard" school approach: add 5 to both sides first, which is mathematically sound. Katie's approach attempts to multiply by 3 first. For Katie to be correct, the equation would have to become $x - 15 = 36$. Her failure to multiply the -5 by 3 is one of the most persistent errors in GCSE foundation and early higher-tier algebra.

**Analysis of Difficulty:**
*   **Tom (Correct):** Most students will recognise $\frac{x}{3} = 17$ as a natural next step ($12 + 5$).
*   **Katie (Incorrect):** This is the "trap." Lower-ability students often see "multiply by 3" and think it only applies to the term with the $x$ and the term on the other side of the equals sign.
*   **Both:** Option C is a very strong distractor for "Proficient" students who know they *can* multiply first, but haven't mastered the distribution over all terms.

**Predicted Performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will guess or gravitate towards C because "there's usually more than one way," or they may choose D if they struggle with basic inverse operations.
*   **Basic:** Significant numbers will choose C. They have been taught that you can multiply by the bottom number, and Katie's "36" looks "mathsy" enough ($12 \times 3$) to be plausible.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually prefer Tom's method but are often tempted by Katie's logic, forgetting the requirement to multiply the constant.
*   **Advanced:** These students will instantly spot that Katie missed multiplying the -5 and will confidently choose A.
