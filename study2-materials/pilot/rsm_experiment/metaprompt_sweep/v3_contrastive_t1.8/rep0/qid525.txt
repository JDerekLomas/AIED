As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on the typical progress of KS3 and KS4 students. 

**Analysis:**
1.  **The Common Traps:** Option **D** is the classic "add the numerators, add the denominators" error ($2+2=4, 7+1=8, 10+4=14$). This is extremely common among lower-ability students.
2.  **Conversion and Improper Fractions:** Option **A** is the correct numerical value but expressed as an improper fraction ($\frac{99}{20}$). Since the question explicitly asks for a **mixed number**, students who are technically proficient but rushed/careless may select this.
3.  **Calculation Errors:** Option **C** ($\frac{99}{40}$) reflects a student who found a common denominator by multiplying $10 \times 4$ but failed to adjust the numerators correctly, or multiplied the denominators for the final result.
4.  **B is the target:** $2\frac{14}{20} + 2\frac{5}{20} = 4\frac{19}{20}$.

Real-world performance shows that "add the tops, add the bottoms" (D) is the strongest distractor for weaker students, while the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number" is the main hurdle for proficient students who might stop at the improper fraction.
