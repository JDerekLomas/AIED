This question tests the fundamental understanding of how division is represented in algebra (the fraction bar) and how brackets affect the grouping of terms.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
The correct answer is **A**. 
- **The "Flip" (Option D):** Many lower-ability students still struggle with the "order" of division, assuming the "larger" expression ($h+4$) must be the divisor or simply reversing the order as they do in some fraction arithmetic.
- **The "Incomplete vinculum" (Option C):** This is a very common error. Students see the $\div$ and apply it only to the first term $h$, ignoring the grouping function of the brackets. 
- **The "Over-complication" (Option B):** Students sometimes try to "balance" the expression by adding $+4$ to the numerator, though this is less common than simple misinterpretation of order or grouping.

For a student at the **proficient** level, this is a "gimme" mark. For **below basic**, the layout of a fraction bar itself can be a barrier to those still wedded to the $\div$ symbol.

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=70% B=5% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=92% B=2% C=4% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
