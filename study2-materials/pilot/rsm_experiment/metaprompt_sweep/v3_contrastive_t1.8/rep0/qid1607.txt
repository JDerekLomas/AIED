In this question, Isaac correctly performs the first step by multiplying both sides by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$), but fails the second step by adding 1 to 60 instead of subtracting it. This is a classic "inverse operation" error. 

Lower-ability students often see "$1+k$" and think that to "get rid" of the 1, they must add it to the other side, or they simply perform $60+1$ because it is a simpler calculation than $60-1$. Middle-ability students (basic/proficient) are the most likely to correctly identify that Step 1 is right but fail to spot the sign error in Step 2, often rushing through the verification. Advanced students usually spot the $+1$ becoming $-1$ transition immediately.

The distractors work well here because Step 1 looks "maths-y" and correct, leading many students to choose "Both" (C) without scrutinising the arithmetic of the second step.
