To solve this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$ and solve for $x$:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$.

**Analysis of student performance:**
*   **The "Plus/Minus" Error:** A common mistake in algebra is failing to correctly handle the negative sign when moving terms. Students who do $10x + 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 27$ will choose **D (2.7)**. This is a very frequent error under exam pressure.
*   **Substitution into the wrong variable:** Students who mistake the row for $x$ and substitute $x = 0.5$ to find $y$ would get $5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y \approx -4.16...$ potentially leading to a guess of **B**.
*   **The "Halving" Error:** Some students see "0.5" and simply divide 30 by 6 then add/subtract half of the coefficient, leading to **A**.
*   **The Decimals:** Because the equation uses "10x", the final division is relatively easy (moving the decimal point), which helps proficient students avoid silly arithmetic errors once they reach $10x = 33$.
