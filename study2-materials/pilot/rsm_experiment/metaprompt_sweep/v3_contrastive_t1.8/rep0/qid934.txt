As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've analysed this question based on how students typically interact with linear equations and tables of values.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
This question tests the ability to substitute a value into an equation that is not in the explicit form ($y = mx + c$). The specific challenge here is that students must handle the $2y$ term once the $4x$ term has vanished (since $x=0$). 

*   **Option C (5)** is the correct answer: $4(0) + 2y = 10 \Rightarrow 2y = 10 \Rightarrow y = 5$.
*   **Option D (2.5)** is a common "calculator-brain" error where students divide the wrong numbers or perform $10 \div 4$. 
*   **Option B (3)** is the "misunderstanding the structure" error, where students see the coefficients 4 and 2 and try to find a number that completes a pattern (4, 3, 2).
*   **Option A (20)** is the "multiplication error" where students see 4 and 5 and multiply them, or fail to divide 10 by 2.

The fact that $x=0$ actually makes this *easier* for advanced students but *harder* for basic students who rely on a process of "multiply the $x$ by the number, then add the other number." When $x=0$, the first term disappears, which can actually confuse lower-ability students who are used to $y$ being the subject.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=55% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%
