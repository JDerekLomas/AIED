This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. While mathematically simple, it triggers two major psychological traps: the **multiplication instinct** (multiplying 10 and 5 to get 50) and the **large-divided-by-small instinct** (assuming the answer must be 10 ÷ 5 = 2).

The mistake $p=2$ (Option C) is the most common error because students often perform the division they find "easier" or misinterpret $\frac{5}{p}$ as $p \div 5$. However, Option B ($p=50$) is also highly attractive to weaker students who simply see two numbers and multiply them because they don't know how to handle the fraction. Advanced students will instantly recognize that for the result to be greater than the numerator, the denominator must be less than 1.
