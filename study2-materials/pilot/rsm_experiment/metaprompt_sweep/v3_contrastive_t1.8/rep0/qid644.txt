As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this question by focusing on the specific "traps" it presents: directed number rules and the operation choice (addition vs. multiplication).

While FOIL/expanding brackets is a staple of the GCSE curriculum, students often falter when the "last" terms are both negative. The most common error is the "additive" misconception (C and D), where students see -1 and -4 and instinctively combine them to get -5, rather than multiplying. The second error (B) occurs when students correctly multiply $1 \times 4$ but forget that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive.

However, because this question specifically asks for one part of the expansion (the multiplication of constants), even lower-ability students are more likely to focus on "multiplication" because that's what the prompt tells them to do, though the presence of negatives remains a significant hurdle.
