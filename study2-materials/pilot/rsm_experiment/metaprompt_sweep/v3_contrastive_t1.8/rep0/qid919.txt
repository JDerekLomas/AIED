This question is a classic "order of operations meets decimals" trap. Students must correctly apply BIDMAS (Indices before Multiplication) and handle the squaring of a decimal ($0.3^2 = 0.09$, not $0.9$).

**The Triggers:**
1.  **BIDMAS error:** Students doing $3 \times 0.3$ first, then squaring $(0.9)^2$, arrive at **A (0.81)**.
2.  **Place Value error:** Students doing $0.3^2 = 0.9$ (thinking $3 \times 3$ but missing the decimal place rule), then $3 \times 0.9$, arrive at **D (2.7)**. This is a very common "high-confidence" error.
3.  **Linear Thinking:** Students seeing the 3 and the 0.3 and just doing $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9 \times 2$ or similar arithmetic muddles arrive at **C (1.8)**.

The correct path ($0.3^2 = 0.09$; $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$) requires both the discipline to follow BIDMAS and the technical skill to square a decimal correctly. In a typical UK classroom, $0.27$ and $2.7$ will be the most frequently debated answers.
