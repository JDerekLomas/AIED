As an experienced UK maths teacher, I would categorize this as a "low demand" addition of fractions question because the denominators are the same and the sum of the fractional parts does not cross a whole integer.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **The "Same Denominator" trap:** Students at the **below_basic** level frequently add the denominators as well as the numerators ($5+5=10$). This makes Option D the primary "distractor."
*   **Mixed Number vs. Improper Fraction:** The question explicitly asks for a mixed number. While $18/5$ (Option B) is mathematically equivalent to the correct answer, it is not in the requested form. **Basic** and **proficient** students usually read the prompt carefully enough to avoid this, but some may default to converting everything to improper fractions first and then forget to convert back.
*   **Computational Errors:** Option C combines two errors: adding the denominators ($5+5=10$) and ignoring the whole numbers while only converting $2 \frac{1}{5}$ or making a multiplication error.
*   **Straightforward nature:** Because $1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5$ (no carrying/regrouping), most **proficient** and **advanced** students will find this trivial.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=92% B=5% C=1% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
