As an experienced teacher, I've seen many students encounter this specific structure. While it looks like a simple one-step equation, the combination of a coefficient and a fraction on the right-hand side is a notorious "trap" for students.

The primary error is **Option A ($p=1/4$)**. Students see the numbers 3 and 12 and instinctively think "division," but instead of dividing 1/12 by 3, they calculate $12 \div 3$. This is the "path of least resistance" calculation.
**Option C ($p=4$)** is chosen by lower-ability students who ignore the fact that 12 is a denominator and simply solve $3p=12$ or perform $12 \div 3$.
**Option D ($p=1/9$)** is a common mistake where students square the 3 or misapply the operation to the numerator only.
**Option B ($p=1/36$)** is the correct answer ($1/12 \div 3 = 1/12 \times 1/3$).

Even proficient students occasionally slip up and choose A because it "looks" right visually ($3 \times 4 = 12$).
