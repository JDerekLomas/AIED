To predict student performance on this question, we must look at the specific steps required to rearrange the sphere volume formula: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

**The Challenge:** This is a literal equation problem (changing the subject of a formula) involving fractions, a transcendental constant ($\pi$), and a power of 3. For UK students (GCSE Higher/Foundation), the main hurdle is "isolating $r$." 

1.  **Option C** is the correct answer. It requires multiplying by 3 and dividing by $4\pi$.
2.  **Option A** is a common mistake where students correctly move the 3 but "pull" the $4\pi$ to the top of the fraction instead of dividing.
3.  **Option B** is a partial rearrangement where the 3 is ignored or wrongly placed.
4.  **Option D** represents a significant algebraic misunderstanding—thinking the cube root only applies to the $V$ or not knowing how to "undo" the fraction coefficient correctly.

**Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will guess or choose Option D because it looks like a formulaic "answer," or A because they struggle with cross-multiplication.
*   **Basic:** They know the formula but struggle with the two-step rearrangement ($4/3$ becoming $3/4$). They are highly likely to flip the fraction the wrong way (Option A).
*   **Proficient:** These students generally know the formula. If they make a mistake, it’s usually a "silly" one regarding the placement of $\pi$ or forgetting to cube root the entire expression.
*   **Advanced:** These students rearrange this fluently and are unlikely to be caught by these distractors.

basic: A=30% B=15% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=96% D=1%
