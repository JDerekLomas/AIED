This question specifically tests the multiplicative inverse property within the context of signed numbers. 

For students, there are two separate cognitive hurdles:
1.  **Reciprocals:** Recognising that $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = 1$.
2.  **The Sign Rule:** Understanding that since the result is $-1$, and we start with a negative, the star must be a **positive** value because $(\text{negative}) \times (\text{positive}) = (\text{negative})$.

The most common trap here is **Option B**. Students often internalize that "to make 1 you flip it," but then apply a superficial "matching" rule where they think the signs must be the same, or they confuse the rule for finding a reciprocal with the rule for finding a perpendicular gradient (where you flip and change the sign). 

**Below Basic** students often choose C or D because they lack the "reciprocal" concept and look for number symmetry. **Basic/Proficient** students frequently fall for the sign trap (Option B). **Advanced** students usually process the sign requirement first and isolate A quickly.

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=45% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=28% C=4% D=3%
advanced: A=94% B=5% C=1% D=0%
