This question is a classic test of two distinct areas: the understanding of negative bases with even exponents and the distinction between multiplication and exponentiation. 

At the **below_basic** and **basic** levels, a significant number of students treat $k^4$ as $k \times 4$, leading to answers involving 12. At the **proficient** level, students know that $3^4 = 81$, but a very common misconception (often reinforced by incorrect calculator input such as $-3^4$ instead of $(-3)^4$) leads them to believe the answer remains negative. At the **advanced** level, students generally recognise that an even power of a negative number results in a positive product.

The numbers chosen here ($3$ and $4$) are small enough that the arithmetic is accessible, making the sign error (Option C) the primary "trap" for mid-to-high ability students.

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=30% D=0%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=5% D=0%
