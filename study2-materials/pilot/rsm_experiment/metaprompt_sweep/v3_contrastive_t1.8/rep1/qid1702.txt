To solve this, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into $10x - 6y = 30$. This gives $10x - 3 = 30$, leading to $10x = 33$ and $x = 3.3$.

**Analysis of Errors:**
- **C (Correct):** Students recognize the equation and solve for $x$ by substituting $y$.
- **A & B (Arithmetic Errors):** Option A (4.25) usually comes from an error where a student thinks they need to divide the 30 or somehow combines the numbers 10, 6, and 0.5 incorrectly. Option B is a sign-error variation.
- **D (Rearrangement/Sign Error):** $10x - 3 = 30$. A common mistake is to subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it, giving $10x = 27$, thus $x = 2.7$. This is a very common trap in GCSE linear equations.

**Difficulty assessment:**
For "Below Basic" students, the formal table format and the decimal 0.5 can be intimidating. "Basic" students often handle the substitution but stumble on the inverse operation (subtracting 3 instead of adding it), making Option D a high-frequency distractor. "Proficient" students should navigate the two-step equation comfortably.

below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=55% D=30%
proficient: A=3% B=2% C=80% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=0% C=96% D=3%
