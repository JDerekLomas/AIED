This question tests the transition from arithmetic notation ($\div$) to algebraic notation (the fraction bar). 

The primary difficulty here lies in the brackets. Students often forget that the horizontal fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol (vinculum), which removes the need for parentheses. Option C is the most common distractor for students who ignore the order of operations/grouping, while Option D is a classic "order of operations" reversal (confusing the numerator and denominator). Option B is a "distributive" error, where students incorrectly think they must apply the $c$ to both terms individually in a way that mimics expansion.

However, because $h+4$ is grouped clearly in the original expression, even Basic level students are statistically quite likely to recognize that it must stay together as a single block in the denominator.
