To predict the performance on this question, we must look at the specific steps of rearranging the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. This is a classic "changing the subject of a formula" task involving a fractional coefficient and a power.

*   **Option C** is the correct answer. To get there, a student must multiply by 3, divide by $4\pi$, and then take the cube root.
*   **Option A** is a common mistake where students "cross-multiply" incorrectly, moving the $\pi$ and $4$ to the numerator alongside $V$.
*   **Option B** occurs when students divide by the $\pi$ correctly but fail to handle the $4/3$ fraction inverted ($4$ ends up on top).
*   **Option D** is a structural error where the student tries to "root" parts of the expression separately or ignores the grouping of the cube root.

This question is difficult because it combines several algebraic steps without providing numerical values. Even proficient students often trip up on whether the 3 or the 4 goes on top when isolating $r$. Below-basic students often choose A or D based on a visual "best fit" of the symbols.

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
