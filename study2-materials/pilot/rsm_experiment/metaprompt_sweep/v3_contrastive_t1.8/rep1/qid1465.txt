This question is a classic test of Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), but it contains a very specific trap that catches students even if they know they should multiply first.

The most common error isn't forgetting the multiplication; it's the "Addition before Subtraction" trap. Many students believe that because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, they must add the $5$ and the $8$ before subtracting from the $3$ (resulting in $3 - 13 = -10$). 

**Breakdown of options:**
*   **A (6):** The correct answer ($3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = 6$).
*   **D (-10):** The primary misconception (treating $5+8$ as a block due to "A before S").
*   **B (4):** Calculating left to right ($3-5+4 = 2$; $2 \times 2 = 4$).
*   **C (-12):** Calculating left to right but incorrectly ($3-5 = -2$; $-2+4 = 2$; then a sign error, or calculating $3 - (5+4) \times 2$).

Low-ability students often default to left-to-right calculation (Option B). Middle-ability students usually know to multiply first, but roughly half of them fall into the "Addition before Subtraction" trap (Option D). High-ability students recognise that addition and subtraction have equal priority.
