This question targets a common area of confusion in linear equations: the order of inverse operations. 

Tom's method is the standard "balance" method (adding 5 to both sides first). Katie's method is the classic "multiplication trap." To multiply by 3 correctly, Katie would need to multiply *every* term, resulting in $x - 15 = 36$. Many students, however, mistakenly believe that multiplying by 3 simply "cancels" the denominator of the fraction without affecting the other terms on that side of the equation.

Because Tom’s working looks very "standard" and correct, almost no student will pick B or D. The crux of the question is whether students recognise Katie's error. Lower-ability students often see "multiply by 3" and "12 becomes 36" and assume she is correct without checking the $-5$. Higher-ability students will recognise the distributive property must apply to the whole side.

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** High probability of choosing C. They see both students doing "mathsy" things (adding and multiplying) and assume both are valid paths.
*   **Basic:** Many will lean toward C because they have been taught you can "do whatever you want as long as you do it to both sides," but they forget the $-5$ must also be multiplied.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually prefer Tom's method and are wary of Katie's. They are the most likely to correctly identify that only Tom is right, though some will still be lured by Katie's "36".
*   **Advanced:** Should easily spot that Katie failed to multiply the $-5$ by $3$.
