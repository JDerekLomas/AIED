This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. Even though the numbers are simple, it triggers a very specific and persistent misconception: the tendency to perform the operation $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$. 

Students at lower ability levels often treat the fraction bar as a signal to divide the "large number by the small number," leading them directly to C ($10 \div 5 = 2$). At the proficient level, students often attempt to rearrange the formula but frequently make the mistake of multiplying 10 and 5, leading to B (50). Advanced students usually recognize the reciprocal relationship ($10p = 5$) and successfully navigate to $0.5$.

One interesting aspect of this specific question is that $0.5$ and $2$ are both "common" results for these digits, but $2$ feels more "natural" to a struggling student than a decimal answer.
