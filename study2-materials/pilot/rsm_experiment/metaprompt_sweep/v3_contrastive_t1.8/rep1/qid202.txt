As an experienced teacher, I have evaluated this specific question. This is a very "kind" version of adding mixed numbers because there is no regrouping required (the sum of the fractions $1/5$ and $2/5$ is less than $1$) and the denominators are already the same.

However, even with simple questions, specific traps occur. The instructions explicitly ask for a **mixed number**, which makes **B** (the correct value as an improper fraction) a common distractor for students who don't read the rubric or prefer improper fraction conversion. **C** and **D** represent the "add the denominators" misconception, which is the most common error in fraction addition. Because $5+5=10$ is such a strong intuitive pull for weaker students, option **D** will be very popular among lower-ability cohorts.

Here is my prediction of the performance:

below_basic: A=35% B=10% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
