As an experienced teacher, I've seen students struggle with algebraic fractions, specifically regarding the "lowest common denominator" when variables are involved. 

**Analysis of the Question:**
The core trap here is whether students treat the denominators as separate entities or recognize that $2x$ is a multiple of $x$. 
*   **A ($\frac{11}{2x}$)** is the correct answer. The common denominator is $2x$, so $\frac{4}{x}$ becomes $\frac{8}{2x}$, and $3+8=11$.
*   **B ($\frac{7}{3x}$)** is the "add across" error ($3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$). This is the most common error for students who lack confidence in fraction addition.
*   **C ($\frac{11}{x}$)** represents the student who knows they need a common denominator but forgets to multiply the numerator or incorrectly scales down the $2x$.
*   **D ($\frac{7}{2x}$)** is the "forgot to scale the numerator" error. The student identifies $2x$ as the common denominator but simply adds the numerators $3+4$. This is a very frequent error even among intermediate students.
