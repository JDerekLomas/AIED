As a UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because it tests "substitution into equations" but presents it in a way that bypasses the traditional $y = mx + c$ format.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
1.  **The Equation Structure:** $4x + 2y = 10$ is implicit. Students used to $y = ...$ often struggle here. However, when $x = 0$, the $4x$ term vanishes, simplifying the task to $2y = 10$.
2.  **The "5" Distractor (Option C):** This is the correct answer. Even students with weak algebraic skills can often intuit that "two of something makes 10."
3.  **The "2.5" Distractor (Option D):** This is a very common trap. Students often see the 4 and the 10 and perform $10 \div 4 = 2.5$, incorrectly focusing on the coefficient of $x$ rather than $y$, or they attempt to find the $x$-intercept rather than the $y$-intercept (though here $x$ is already 0).
4.  **The "3" Distractor (Option B):** Students often try to find a pattern in the $y$ values before they have calculated them. They might guess a "gradient-like" step or simply pick a middle-of-the-road number.
5.  **The "20" Distractor (Option A):** This usually comes from a "multiplication-only" mindset ($4 \times 0$ is ignored, but then they do $2 \times 10$).

The fact that $x=0$ makes this significantly easier than if $x=1$ or $x=2$ were asked, as it eliminates the need for subtraction before division.
