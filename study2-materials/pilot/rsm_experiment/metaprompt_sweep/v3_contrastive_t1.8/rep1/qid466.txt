To answer this question effectively, we must look at the interplay between two distinct concepts: **reciprocals** and **directed numbers (negatives)**. 

The equation asks for the value that, when multiplied by a negative, results in a negative product. This requires the multiplier to be positive ($-\times+ = -$). However, the "multiplicative inverse" rule (a number times its reciprocal equals 1) is so strongly drilled into students that many will instinctively pick the reciprocal without checking the sign, or they will wrongly assume that "to keep the answer negative, the second number must also be negative."

**Analysis of the levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will choose D simply by trying to "match" the numbers they see, or C because they ignore the fraction inversion entirely.
*   **Basic:** This is the peak group for picking **B**. These students know that $3/4 \times 4/3 = 1$, but they often apply a "matching signs" logic, thinking two negatives are needed to keep the context negative, or simply forgetting that $-\times- = +$.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually recognize the reciprocal ($4/3$), but about a third will still make a "reflex" sign error under pressure.
*   **Advanced:** Most will check the calculation $( -3/4 \times 4/3 = -12/12 = -1)$ and realize that a negative times a positive is required to result in a negative.
