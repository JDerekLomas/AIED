As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on the specific "traps" it contains. The inclusion of the number $0$ in a dataset is a classic "mean" hurdle. 

Students often struggle with two competing ideas:
1. **The Role of Zero:** Many students intuitively believe that because adding zero doesn't change the sum, it shouldn't be counted in the divisor. This leads them to choice C.
2. **Order of Operations (BIDMAS):** Choice B is a common "calculator error" representation. Students who write their work linearly without brackets often forget that division takes precedence over addition.
3. **The Correct Process:** Choice A is actually the correct calculation ($\frac{15}{5} = 3$), as the numerator sum is the same whether $0$ is explicitly written or not.

However, many students look for the $0$ to be explicitly shown in the numerator to "feel" right, or they may doubt themselves because Choice A "misses" a number, making Choice D a tempting "escape" for higher-ability students who are overthinking the formatting.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=35% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=15% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%
