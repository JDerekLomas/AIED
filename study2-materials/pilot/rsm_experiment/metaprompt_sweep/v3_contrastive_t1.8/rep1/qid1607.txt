In this question, Isaac performs the first step correctly by multiplying both sides by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). however, in Step 2, he makes a common "inverse operation" error. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$, he adds 1 to 60.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
This is a classic diagnostic question for linear equations. Step 1 is handled well by most students as "multiplying by the denominator" is a well-drilled first step. The error in Step 2 is the primary discriminator. 
*   **Below Basic** students often struggle with the initial multiplication or assume that because $61$ "looks like" a plausible answer in relation to $60$ and $1$, the whole thing is correct. They often guess C.
*   **Basic** students recognize that $15 \times 4 = 60$, confirming Step 1. However, they are highly prone to the "sign change" error, seeing $+1$ and thinking they should add $1$ to the other side to "keep it balanced" or simply misapplying the inverse. Many will choose C.
*   **Proficient** students are usually wary. They will check the arithmetic ($60-1=59$) and realize Step 2 is an error. Option A is the dominant choice here.
*   **Advanced** students will quickly solve the equation themselves and spot the sign error immediately.
