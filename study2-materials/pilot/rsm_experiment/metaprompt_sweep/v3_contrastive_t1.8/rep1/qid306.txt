This question addresses two major aspects of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Problem P tests the "Left-to-Right" rule for addition and subtraction (which are of equal priority), a concept that often trips up students who take the "A" before "S" in BIDMAS too literally. Problem Q tests the standard priority of multiplication over addition.

Option D is the most common distractor because many students are taught BIDMAS as a rigid hierarchy where addition *must* come before subtraction. Therefore, even high-performing students who haven't been taught the "equal priority" rule for P will incorrectly select D. Option A represents students who simply work left-to-right regardless of operators, failing the BIDMAS rule in Q. Option B is the mathematically correct answer.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=5% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
advanced: A=2% B=85% C=1% D=12%
