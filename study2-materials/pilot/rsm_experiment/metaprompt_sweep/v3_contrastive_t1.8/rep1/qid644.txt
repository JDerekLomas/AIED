As an experienced UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as a test of "directed number multiplication" within the context of expanding brackets. 

The primary pitfalls here are:
1. **The Negative/Negative Rule:** Students frequently remember that two negatives "make a plus," but they often forget to apply it when the symbols are separated.
2. **Operation Confusion:** Below-basic and basic students often "combine" terms rather than multiplying them ($-1 - 4 = -5$ or $-1 + -4 = -5$), leading to option D.
3. **The Magnitude Trap:** Some students might simply see $1$ and $4$ and think of addition rather than multiplication ($1+4=5$).

However, because the question specifically asks for "multiplies," it directs the student away from the addition error more effectively than if they were simply asked to expand the whole expression. Therefore, even weaker students have a higher chance of success here than on a full expansion.

Below is the predicted performance based on typical UK secondary school cohorts (KS3/KS4):

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=8% C=2% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
