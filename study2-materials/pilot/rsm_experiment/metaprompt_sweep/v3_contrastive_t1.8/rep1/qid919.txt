This question tests three distinct skills: substitution, order of operations (BIDMAS), and arithmetic with decimals.

The most common trap here is not the order of operations, but the calculation of $0.3^2$. Many students incorrectly believe $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. If a student calculates $3 \times 0.9$, they get 2.7 (Option D). If they correctly square $0.3$ to get $0.09$, they reach $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$ (Option B). 

Option A ($0.81$) is a "double trap" where the student does $(3 \times 0.3)^2$, violating BIDMAS. Option C ($1.8$) is usually a result of multiplying the base by the index ($0.3 \times 2$) and then multiplying by 3.

Because the decimal is "0.3", the tendency to forget the second decimal place in the squaring step is extremely high, making D a very attractive distractor for mid-to-low ability students.
