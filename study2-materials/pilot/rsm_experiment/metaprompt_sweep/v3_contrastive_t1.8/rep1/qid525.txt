As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on common classroom observations regarding mixed number addition.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
1.  **The Common Trap (D):** The most frequent error for lower-ability students is "adding across"—adding the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and then adding the numerators and denominators ($7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$), leading to $4 \frac{8}{14}$.
2.  **Improper vs. Mixed (A):** Option A is actually mathematically equivalent to the correct answer ($4 \frac{19}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$). However, the question explicitly asks for the answer as a **mixed number**. High-ability students will spot this, but "proficient" students who convert everything to improper fractions first might stop as soon as they reach $\frac{99}{20}$ and select A without re-reading the prompt.
3.  **The Denominator Error (C):** Students often multiply the denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but fail to adjust the numerators correctly, or simply lose track of the whole numbers.
4.  **Success Rates:** The calculation $7/10 + 1/4$ requires finding a common denominator (20). This is a multi-step process that middle-ability students often start correctly but frequently make a small arithmetic slip on.
