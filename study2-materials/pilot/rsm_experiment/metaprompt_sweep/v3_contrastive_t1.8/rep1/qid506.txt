As an experienced UK maths teacher, I look at this question and see a classic "operation choice" trap. While the algebra looks simple, the presence of fractions causes a significant cognitive load for students.

The core difficulty here is whether students divide by 3 (multiplying the denominator) or multiply by 3 (incorrectly attempting to "move" the 3 or misinterpreting the reciprocal).

**A ($p = 1/4$):** This is the most common error. Students see $3$ and $12$ and their brains immediately jump to "How many 3s in 12?". They perform $12 \div 3 = 4$ but keep it in the denominator.
**B ($p = 1/36$):** The correct answer. Requires the student to realise that to undo "multiply by 3", they must divide by 3, which is the same as multiplying the denominator by 3 ($1/12 \times 1/3$).
**C ($p = 4$):** A "cleaner" version of option A. Students ignore the fraction structure entirely and just perform $12 \div 3$. This is very common at the below-basic level.
**D ($p = 1/9$):** A less common distractor, usually resulting from students confusing $1/12$ with $1/3$ or making a subtraction error (12 - 3).

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
