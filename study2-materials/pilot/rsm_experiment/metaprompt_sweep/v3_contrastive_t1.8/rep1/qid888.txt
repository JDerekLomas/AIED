As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this double-bracket expansion as a standard but high-risk question due to the involvement of two negative constants. While most students know the "FOIL" or grid method, the specific arithmetic of $(-5) + (-7) = -12$ and $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$ provides two major "tripwires."

1.  **The Middle Term:** Students who confuse addition and multiplication or have poor directed number skills will subtract 5 from 7 to get $-2m$ (Option A).
2.  **The Constant Term:** This is the biggest pitfall. Students often remember that a "minus and a minus make a plus" for multiplication, but under exam pressure, many default to writing $-35$ because they see minus signs in the brackets (Option D). Option C is less common, chosen by those who lose track of the signs for the middle term entirely.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
