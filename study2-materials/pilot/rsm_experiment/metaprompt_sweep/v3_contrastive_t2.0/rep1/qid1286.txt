To predict the performance on this question, we must look at the specific steps of rearranging the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

This question is a high-level test of algebraic manipulation involving fractions and powers. Many students remember the sphere volume formula but struggle to rearrange it correctly, especially when dealing with the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$.
*   **The common trap (Option A):** Students often multiply by the $4\pi$ instead of dividing because they see them in the "numerator" position of the formula and get confused about inverse operations.
*   **The coefficient trap (Option B):** This represents a student who correctly moves the $\pi$ but flips the fraction $3/4$ the wrong way or fails to associate $\pi$ with the 4.
*   **The grouping trap (Option D):** This is for students who understand they need a cube root but fail to apply it to the constants, or perform the algebraic steps in the wrong order.

Option C is the correct rearrangement ($\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$, so $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$).

**Below Basic:** These students often pick at random or choose Option A because "multiplication" feels like the natural first step when they see a formula, or Option D because they don't grasp how the radical symbol applies to the whole expression.
**Basic:** Students here usually know the formula but struggle with "fractional" algebra. They often confuse whether the 3 goes on the top or bottom.
**Proficient:** These students usually perform the rearrangement correctly but are susceptible to "copying errors" where they might move the $\pi$ to the wrong side of the fraction bar.
**Advanced:** These students have mastered changing the subject of a formula involving powers and roots.
