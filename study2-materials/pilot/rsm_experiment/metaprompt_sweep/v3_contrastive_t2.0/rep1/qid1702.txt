To solve this, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into $10x - 6y = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, so $x = 3.3$.

**Teacher's Insight:**
This question tests algebraic substitution and the ability to rearrange a linear equation. The primary "trap" here is the confusion between variables. Many students at lower ability levels default to substituting for $x$ even when the table clearly shows the value is for $y$. If a student mistakenly substitutes $x = 0.5$, they get $5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y = -4.16...$, which isn't an option, though they might guess B ($ -4.25$) as it looks similar. Option C is the correct calculation. Option D ($2.7$) is a common error where students subtract the 3 instead of adding ($10x = 27$), a very frequent mistake when solving equations. Option A is a distractor for those who struggle with signs or specific arithmetic steps. 

Because the decimal $0.5$ is easy to work with (half of 6 is 3), proficient students will find this straightforward, but basic students often trip up on the two-step equation $(10x - 3 = 30)$ at the final stages.
