This question specifically tests two potential pitfalls: the confusion between multiplication and exponentiation (3 × 4 vs 3⁴) and the treatment of negative signs when raising a number to an even power. 

For below-basic students, the "3 times 4" error is extremely common, leading them to B or D. Among basic and proficient students, the most significant trap is the sign error. Many students associate negative inputs with negative outputs (especially those reliant on calculators who might type $-3^4$ without brackets, resulting in $-81$). However, advanced students will recognise that a negative number multiplied by itself an even number of times yields a positive result.

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=5% D=0%
