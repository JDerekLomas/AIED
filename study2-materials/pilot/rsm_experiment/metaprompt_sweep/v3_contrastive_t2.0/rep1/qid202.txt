As an experienced UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as being on the "easier" end of the fractions spectrum, primarily because the denominators are already the same and the sum of the fractional parts ($\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$) does not require renaming or bridging into another whole number.

The primary distractors here are **D**, which targets the common misconception of adding denominators (very common at lower ability levels), and **B**, which is mathematically equivalent but ignores the specific instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number."

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many students here will follow the "add everything" rule ($2+1=3$, $1+2=3$, $5+5=10$), making **D** a very popular choice.
*   **Basic:** Students generally know to keep the denominator the same, but they are most likely to overlook the specific instruction about the format of the answer, or potentially choose **C** if they are confused about how to combine whole numbers and fractions.
*   **Proficient:** These students almost always get the calculation correct. A small percentage will fall into the trap of choosing **B** (improper fraction) because they convert everything to $\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}$ and stop there, failing to convert back or read the final instruction.
*   **Advanced:** These students will identify the correct sum and format almost immediately.

below_basic: A=45% B=5% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=97% B=2% C=0% D=1%
