As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've analyzed this specific question. Here is my breakdown of how students across different ability levels are likely to respond:

**Key Considerations:**
*   **The Trap (Option D):** This is the classic "add the numerators, add the denominators" error ($2+2=4, 7+1=8, 10+4=14$). This remains the most popular distractor for students below "proficient."
*   **Format Constraints:** The question specifically asks for a **mixed number**. Option A is numerically correct ($4 \frac{19}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$), but it is an improper fraction. High-ability students will notice the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number," whereas lower-ability students might convert to improper fractions to solve, find $\frac{99}{20}$, and select A without reading the final constraint.
*   **The Arithmetic (Option B):** Finding a common denominator of 20 is a standard task for UK Year 7-9 students. Most "proficient" students will successfully convert to $2 \frac{14}{20} + 2 \frac{5}{20}$.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=20% D=45%
*Students here struggle with common denominators and will almost instinctively add across the numerators and denominators (D) or guess (C).*

basic: A=25% B=35% C=10% D=30%
*Many students at this level convert to improper fractions first. They might calculate $\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$ and select A, missing the instruction for a mixed number.*

proficient: A=15% B=75% C=2% D=8%
*Most will handle the common denominator well. A small percentage will fall into the "improper fraction" trap (A) or make a silly addition error resulting in D.*

advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
*High-performing students will identify the correct common denominator and strictly follow the formatting instruction. The few who miss B will likely be due to a rare lapse in reading the mixed number constraint.*
