This question tests the transition from arithmetic notation ($\div$) to algebraic notation (the fraction bar) and the understanding of grouping in division. 

While the concept is fundamental, the brackets around $(h+4)$ are a strong visual cue that helps students keep that expression together as the denominator. The most common error is D (reversing the dividend and divisor), which is a persistent issue for students who struggle with the "order" of division. Option C is a common "formatting" error where students forget the division bar acts as a grouping symbol for the entire expression. Option B is a less common error involving misreading or "averaging" the variables.

Because the brackets are explicitly written in the question, this is significantly easier than if the question were written as $c \div h + 4$ (where BIDMAS would apply). The explicit grouping helps even lower-ability students identify A as the "visual" equivalent.
