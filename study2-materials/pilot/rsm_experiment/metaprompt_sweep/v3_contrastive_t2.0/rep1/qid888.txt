As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this quadratic expansion question based on its specific numerical properties: the presence of two negative constants.

This is a classic "sign error" trap. The most common mistakes students make here are:
1.  **The Constant Term:** Many students recall that a "minus and a minus make a plus" when multiplying $(-5 \times -7 = +35)$, but a significant minority will mistakenly write $-35$, leading them to options A or D.
2.  **The Linear Term:** Adding $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$ is generally handled well, but those who confuse the multiplication/addition rules of directed numbers may end up with $+12$ (Option C) or a difference of 2 (Option A).

**A** is the "distractor for confusion"—the student subtracts the numbers ($7-5=2$) and gets the sign wrong on the constant.
**C** is the "double negative" error—the student thinks two minuses always make a plus, even when adding the linear terms.
**D** is the most common error for mid-tier students—they correctly sum to $-12$ but fail to multiply the two negatives to get positive $35$.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
