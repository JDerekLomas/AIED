As a UK maths teacher, I see this specific type of question frequently when teaching expansion of binomials. While it tests the basic skill of multiplication within FOIL (the 'Last' terms), the primary hurdle here isn't the algebra—it's the manipulation of directed numbers (integers).

**Key insights for this question:**
1.  **The Double Negative Trap:** This is the most significant factor. For `below_basic` and `basic` students, the rule "a minus times a minus is a plus" is often forgotten or misapplied. Many see two minus signs and instinctually choose a negative result.
2.  **Operation Confusion (Addition vs. Multiplication):** `basic` students often switch operations mid-problem. Instead of multiplying $(-1) \times (-4)$, they calculate $-1 - 4 = -5$ or $-1 + (-4) = -5$. This makes Option D a very "sticky" distractor.
3.  **Basic Arithmetic:** Option C (+5) is a result of students adding the absolute values (1 + 4) but ignoring the multiplication instruction.

**Predictive Percentages:**

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=2% D=13%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%

**Reasoning:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often guess or default to addition/subtraction. Option D is highly attractive because $-1$ and $-4$ "look like" they should make $-5$.
*   **Basic:** Many of these students know they should multiply, but about a third will still struggle with the sign, choosing B, or revert to addition (D).
*   **Proficient:** These students generally know the signs and the operation. The main error here is a "silly mistake" where they accidentally add instead of multiply under pressure (Option D).
*   **Advanced:** Almost all will correctly identify that a negative multiplied by a negative is a positive and that $1 \times 4 = 4$.
