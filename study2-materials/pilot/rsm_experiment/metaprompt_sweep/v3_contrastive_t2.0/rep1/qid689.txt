This question specifically tests the ability to solve equations where the unknown is in the denominator. This is a notorious "hinge" point in KS3 and GCSE algebra.

Students at the lower end often struggle with the "multiplicative direction" of the equation. A very common error is to treat the relationship as $p = 10 \div 5$ (leading to $p=2$) or simply to multiply both numbers shown ($10 \times 5 = 50$). However, $p=0.5$ (Option A) is the most attractive distractor for students who understand that $p$ must be "smaller" than 5 to make the result 10, but who perform the division in the wrong order or assume $10 \div 5 = 0.5$ in a moment of cognitive overload.

The "no solutions" option (D) acts as a low-level distractor for students who believe a larger number cannot be the result of dividing a smaller number (unless negatives are involved).

**Key Analysis:**
*   **The Trap:** $p=2$ (Option C) is the strongest distractor because $10$ and $5$ naturally suggest $2$. 
*   **The Correct Logic:** To solve $10 = \frac{5}{p}$, students must multiply by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, then divide by 10 to get $p = \frac{5}{10}$.
*   **Performance:** Advanced students will instinctively see that 10 is half of 5's reciprocal context, or simply follow the algebraic steps. Basic/Below Basic students will almost certainly gravitate towards $C$ or $B$.
