As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on common classroom experiences with the order of operations (BIDMAS) and decimal place value.

The difficulty in this specific question arises from two main areas:
1.  **Order of Operations (BIDMAS):** Students frequently multiply $3 \times 0.3$ first ($0.9$) and then square the result, leading to **A** ($0.81$).
2.  **Decimal Multiplication:** When squaring $0.3$, students often think $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ instead of $0.09$. If they then multiply $0.9$ by $3$, they arrive at **D** ($2.7$).
3.  **Place Value Errors:** A simple "tripling" error without squaring at all leads to **B** ($0.3 \times 3 = 0.9 \dots$ some may mistakenly gravitate to $0.27$ if they think "three cubed" or "three squared times three" without careful tracking). However, **C** (1.8) is less likely, though some see the power of 2 and multiply $0.9 \times 2$.

**A (0.81)** is the most common high-level mistake (multiplying before squaring). **D (2.7)** is a very attractive "distractor" for those who struggle with where the decimal point goes after squaring.
