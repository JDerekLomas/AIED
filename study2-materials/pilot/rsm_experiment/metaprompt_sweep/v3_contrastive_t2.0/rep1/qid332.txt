This question targets a common operational misconception in algebra: the order of inverse operations and the application of the distributive property (or lack thereof) when multiplying through an equation.

Tom's method is the standard "step-by-step" approach (adding 5 to both sides), which most students find intuitive. Katie’s method represents "multiplying through by 3" first. Many students believe they can multiply just the fraction term and the result on the RHS by 3, forgetting to multiply the -5. Therefore, $x - 5 = 36$ is a classic "false" step (the correct version would be $x - 15 = 36$).

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will gravitate towards Tom because it looks like a "normal" first step. However, a significant portion will see both steps as looking "mathsy" and guess C.
*   **Basic:** This group usually knows how to "move the 5," so they will identify Tom as correct. However, they are highly susceptible to Katie's trap because $12 \times 3 = 36$ looks correct, and they often forget that *every* term must be multiplied.
*   **Proficient:** These students are generally reliable with Tom's method. They are better at spotting that Katie has missed the 5, but some will still fall for the "multiplied the answer and the fraction" logic.
*   **Advanced:** Most will immediately recognise that Katie failed to multiply the constant term by 3 and correctly identify that Only Tom is correct.
