To solve this problem, a student must find a common denominator (2x). The first fraction is already over 2x, but the second requires multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 2, turning $\frac{4}{x}$ into $\frac{8}{2x}$. Adding the numerators gives $\frac{11}{2x}$.

**Analysis of Errors:**
- **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** The most common lower-level error where students add the numerators ($3+4=7$) and add the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). 
- **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** Students identify the common denominator correctly as $2x$ but forget to adjust the numerator of the second fraction, simply doing $3+4=7$.
- **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** Students correctly find the new numerator (11) but get confused about the denominator, perhaps thinking that adding $x$ and $2x$ "cancels" something out or choosing the simplest-looking denominator.

The "trap" in this question is that the denominators are very similar ($2x$ and $x$), making it easier to spot the common denominator than if they were, say, $2x$ and $3y$. However, the classic "add across" error is extremely prevalent in the UK Foundation tier.
