As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've analyzed this specific question. This is a common "entry point" to linear graphs/algebra.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **The Trap (Option A):** This is for students who confuse $x$ and $y$. They see $4(x)$ and $2(y)$, but because $x=0$, they effectively multiply the constants $4 \times 5 = 20$ or try to make the total by ignore the operations.
*   **The Common Error (Option D):** Many students see the $4x$ and think about the coefficient of $x$ being the "starting value" or confuse $10/4$ with the answer. 
*   **The Successful Strategy (Option C):** At $x=0$, the term $4x$ vanishes. The equation simplifies to $2y=10$. This is generally high-success because $10 \div 2$ is an "easy" number.
*   **The Distractor (Option B):** Students might try to solve for $y$ when $x=1$ (yielding $2y=6, y=3$) because they prefer working with non-zero integers, or they simply subtract $4$ and $2$ from $10$.

This question is slightly easier than usual because $x=0$. In equations like $ax + by = c$, $x=0$ is the least algebraically demanding substitution, though lower-ability students still struggle with the implicit multiplication and the two-step structure.
