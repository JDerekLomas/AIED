This question addresses two major pillars of early algebra: the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the "left-to-right" convention for operations of equal priority (addition and subtraction).

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **Problem P ($4 - 5 + 6$):** This is the "trap" for students who follow the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS too literally. Because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the mnemonic, many students wrongly believe they must calculate $5 + 6$ first. However, Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be done left-to-right. 
*   **Problem Q ($4 + 5 \times 6$):** This is a standard test of the priority of Multiplication over Addition. Most students from "Basic" upward have been drilled in this, though "Below Basic" students still tend to work purely left-to-right.

The combination of these two problems makes **Option B** the correct answer, but **Option D** is an extremely high-frequency distractor for even "Proficient" students who have been taught the BIDMAS acronym but haven't mastered the equal priority rule for $A/S$.

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=55% C=5% D=35%
advanced: A=1% B=90% C=1% D=8%
