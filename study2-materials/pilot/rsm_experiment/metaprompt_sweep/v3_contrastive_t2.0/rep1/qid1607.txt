In this question, students must identify that Step 1 is correct (multiplying by 4) but Step 2 is incorrect (adding 1 instead of subtracting 1). 

The numbers used (15 and 4) are friendly, so most students will successfully navigate Step 1 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). The primary "trap" is the common error in Step 2: "change the side, change the sign." Many lower-ability students see the $+1$ and instinctively want to add 1 to the other side ($60 + 1$) rather than perform the inverse operation ($60 - 1$). Because students often struggle to "unpick" an already written solution, many will see the jump from 60 to 61 as natural addition.

**Below Basic:** These students often struggle with multi-step logic. A large portion will see any "maths" happening (like $15 \times 4$ and $60 + 1$) and assume it's correct (C).
**Basic:** This group usually understands Step 1 but frequently falls for the inverse operation error in Step 2. They are the most likely to choose C.
**Proficient:** These students generally recognise the need for inverse operations. They will spot that Step 2 should be subtraction, leading them to choose A.
**Advanced:** These students will quickly verify the steps. They might double-check if 61 works in the original equation ($\frac{1+61}{4} = \frac{62}{4} \neq 15$), confirming A is the only choice.
