As a UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because it tests three distinct procedural concepts simultaneously: the inclusion of zero in a mean, the divisor for that mean, and the mathematical hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS).

**Breakdown of the choices:**
- **A (The correct answer):** While $0$ is part of the set, adding $0$ doesn't change the numerator. Dividing by $5$ is correct because there are five data points.
- **B (The BIDMAS trap):** Many students intuitively write their work linearly. This expression actually represents $0+1+3+4+(7 \div 5)$. Only very low-ability students or those rushing forget the role of brackets/the fraction bar here.
- **C (The 'Ignore Zero' trap):** This is the classic misconception where students think zero "doesn't count" as a piece of data.
- **D (The 'Hidden Zero' trap):** Students who think the calculation *must* explicitly show the $+0$ to be "correct" will choose this, thinking A is technically incomplete.

The numbers $0, 1, 3, 4, 7$ sum to 15, which is exactly divisible by 5. Because the numbers are "friendly," students are more likely to think about the actual calculation, which often leads them to overlook the missing "$+0$" in option A, actually helping them find the right answer.

Here is my prediction for the percentage distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=3% D=3%
