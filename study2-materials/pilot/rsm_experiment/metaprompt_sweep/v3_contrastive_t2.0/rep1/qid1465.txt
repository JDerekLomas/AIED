This order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) question is a classic "trap" for students who follow mnemonic rules strictly but incorrectly.

**The Key Traps:**
1.  **Addition vs. Subtraction Order:** Many students believe Addition must always come before Subtraction (AS). This leads to $5 + 4 = 9$, then $3 - 9 = -6$ (not an option) or $3 - 9 + 8 \dots$ causing significant confusion. 
2.  **Left-to-Right Blindness:** Some ignore order altogether and calculate $(3-5+4) \times 2 = 4$, which leads to Option B.
3.  **The Correct Path:** $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 + 8$. At this stage, students must know to work left-to-right (Subtract, then Add) to get $6$.

Option A is correct. Option B is the most common error for students with basic fluency who ignore BIDMAS. Option C and D attract those who do the addition of $5+4$ first and then make further arithmetic errors with negative numbers.
