As an experienced UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on common classroom observations regarding mixed number addition.

The most common trap here is Option D, which represents the "add the tops, add the bottoms" misconception ($7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$), which is the predominant error for lower-attaining students. Option A is the correct numerical value but is an improper fraction ($ \frac{99}{20} $); since the question specifically asks for a "mixed number," many mid-to-high ability students who solve it correctly will move past A to B, but some basic/below-basic students will see A as a "finished" calculation if they converted to improper fractions first. Option C is a common error resulting from multiplying the denominators to find a common one ($40$) but failing to adjust the numerators correctly, or simply picking a "maths-looking" number.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=25% D=45%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
