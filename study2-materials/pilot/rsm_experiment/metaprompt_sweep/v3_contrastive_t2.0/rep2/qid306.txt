This question is a classic test of the "Order of Operations" hierarchy. The key discriminator here isn't Problem Q (which tests the standard BIDMAS/BODMAS rule that multiplication comes before addition), but Problem P. 

Many students are taught the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS literally, believing that because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction), they must always add before they subtract. In reality, addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be performed from left to right. This specific question (4 - 5 + 6) is a "trap" for students who follow the acronym too rigidly; if they do $5+6$ first, they get an answer of $-7$, whereas the correct left-to-right calculation $4-5$ gives an answer of $5$.

**Option B** is the correct mathematical procedure. 
**Option D** is the most common misconception (The "Acronym Trap").

Here is the predicted distribution of responses for UK students:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=15% D=50%
basic: A=10% B=25% C=5% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=55% C=2% D=38%
advanced: A=1% B=85% C=1% D=13%
