As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common classroom observations and student performance data for linear equations.

**Teacher Analysis:**
The primary challenge of this specific question is that the equation is presented in an implicit form ($ax + by = c$) rather than the explicit form ($y = mx + c$) that lower-ability students are more comfortable with.
*   **The Trap (Option C):** This is the most likely error for students who lack confidence with algebra. When $x=0$ is ignored or not properly substituted, students often see $2y = 10$ and quickly perform $10 \div 2$. However, even more commonly, they see $4+2y=10 \Rightarrow 2y=6 \Rightarrow y=3$ (using $x=1$ instead of $x=0$). 
*   **The Zero Confusion (Option C):** A very common mistake when $x=0$ is for students to assume the answer is simply the constant at the end of the equation if they miss the coefficient of $y$, or to confuse it with $y$-intercepts in $y=mx+c$.
*   **Arithmetic/Conceptual Errors (Options A and D):** $20$ comes from multiplying $10$ by $2$, and $2.5$ comes from $10 \div 4$ (ignoring $y$).
*   **The correct answer (C=5):** When $x=0$, $4(0) + 2y = 10 \Rightarrow 2y = 10 \Rightarrow y = 5$. Because it involves a zero, many students actually find this *easier* than if $x$ were $1$, provided they don't panic at the equation format.
