To predict the performance on this question, we must consider the algebraic manipulation required to rearrange the sphere volume formula: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. 

This question is difficult because it combines three potential points of failure: 
1. **Recall**: Students must remember the specific formula (or locate it if provided in a formula booklet, though many miss-apply the fraction).
2. **Algebraic Inversion**: Rearranging a fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ involves multiplying by $3$ and dividing by $4$. Students frequently "cross-multiply" incorrectly, leading to option B ($4V$ instead of $3V$).
3. **The Cube Root**: Distinguishing between Option C (correct) and Option D (where the student forgets the $4\pi$ is inside the radical) tests their understanding of order of operations and radicals.

**Option A** is for those who mix up the fraction entirely. **Option B** is the most common distractor, representing those who associate "4" with the top and "3" with the bottom without performing the inverse operation. **Option D** represents a student who knows the inverse of "cubing" is "cube rooting" but fails to apply the notation to the constants.
