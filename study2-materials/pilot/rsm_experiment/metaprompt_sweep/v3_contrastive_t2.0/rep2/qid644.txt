This question tests a very specific component of the FOIL (First, Outside, Inside, Last) method: multiplying two negative constants.

While most students identify the numbers as 1 and 4, the primary difficulty lies in the integer arithmetic and the distinction between multiplying and adding. 

1.  **The Multiplication/Addition Confusion:** Lower-ability students often see "-1" and "-4" and instinctively perform -1 - 4 to get -5, or simply sum them and lose the sign to get 5. This makes Options C and D highly attractive distractors for students below the "proficient" level.
2.  **The Sign Rule:** For students who know they must multiply (getting 4), the "minus times a minus equals a plus" rule is often forgotten under pressure by "Basic" students, leading them to choose -4.
3.  **Specific Context:** Because the arrows are visually distinct, the "Advanced" and "Proficient" groups rarely fail this, as they don't have to worry about the variable terms ($2p, 3p$), though a small percentage of proficient students will make a "sign slip" to B.

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
