This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. While mathematically straightforward, it creates a significant cognitive conflict for lower-ability students because the smaller number is being divided by the variable to produce a larger result ($5 \div p = 10$).

The most common error for students at the below-basic and basic levels is "operational commutativity" or simply looking for a relationship between 10 and 5. Option C ($p=2$) is the most attractive distractor because $10 \div 5 = 2$. Option B ($p=50$) is chosen by those who think they need to multiply the two visible numbers. Option A is the correct answer ($5 \div 10$), which many lower-ability students reject instinctively because they believe "you can't divide a smaller number by a bigger one" or that $5/10$ would be $2$.

Advanced students handle the algebraic rearrangement ($\text{multiply by } p$, then $\text{divide by } 10$) without issue.
