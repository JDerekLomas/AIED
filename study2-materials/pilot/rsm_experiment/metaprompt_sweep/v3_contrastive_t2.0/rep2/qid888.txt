As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this quadratic expansion by focusing on the specific "double negative" challenge it presents. This question is a classic filter for students who understand the process of FOIL or a grid method but struggle with directed numbers.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **A ($-2m, -35$):** This attracts students who think that because there are subtractions in the brackets, there must be a subtraction in the final constant, or those who calculate $-7 + 5$ or $7 - 5$ incorrectly.
*   **B (Correct):** Requires correctly calculating $-5 + -7 = -12$ and $-5 \times -7 = +35$.
*   **C ($+12m, +35$):** A very common error where students think "two negatives make a positive" applies to the middle term (the addition) as well as the multiplication.
*   **D ($-12m, -35$):** This is the most common trap. Many students correctly sum to $-12$ but habitually write a minus sign for the final constant because the original brackets both contained minus signs.

**Student Performance Predictions:**

**below_basic:** A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
Students at this level often treat these numbers as "pick and mix." The sign of the constant term is usually a guess. They struggle with $-5 \times -7$ being positive.

**basic:** A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
At this level, the expansion method is understood, but the integer arithmetic is shaky. Many will correctly find $-12m$ but fall for the trap of $-35$ in Option D because they don't apply the "minus times a minus" rule consistently.

**proficient:** A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
These students generally get the method right. The most common error remains a sign slip on the $+35$, though they are much less likely to make it than the "basic" cohort.

**advanced:** A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
Advanced students should handle the directed numbers fluably. Any errors here are likely "slips" or "brain fades" rather than fundamental misunderstandings of the signs.

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=05% B=75% C=05% D=15%
advanced: A=01% B=96% C=01% D=02%
