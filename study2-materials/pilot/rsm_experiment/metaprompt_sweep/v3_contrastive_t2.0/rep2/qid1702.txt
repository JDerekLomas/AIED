To solve this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into $10x - 6y = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, and $x = 3.3$.

**Analysis of Difficulty:**
This is a high-level table-of-values question because it asks for $x$ given $y$, rather than the more common $y$ given $x$.
1.  **The Substitution Trap:** Students who instinctively substitute $0.5$ for $x$ instead of $y$ will calculate $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y = -4.16...$ (Not an option, but close to B).
2.  **The Sign Error:** $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30$. Students who see the minus sign but add incorrectly or subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it will get $10x = 27$, leading to **Option D**.
3.  **Basic Arithmetic:** Students guessing often gravitate towards **Option A** because $0.5$ is "half", and they try to manipulate the numbers $10, 6, 30$ in a way that feels like it involves a ".25" or ".75".

Most proficient students will handle the two-step equation comfortably. Below basic students will struggle significantly with the "backwards" nature of the table and likely choose D or A based on "number feel."
