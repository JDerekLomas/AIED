This question tests the translation of linear arithmetic notation into algebraic fraction notation. While the concept of a division sign becoming a fraction bar is fundamental, the bracketed term $(h+4)$ provides the primary "distractor" source. 

**Option D** is a classic "order of division" error, where students mistakenly believe the divisor goes on top. **Option C** is a BODMAS/Order of Operations misconception, where students might think the division only applies to the letter immediately adjacent to it ($c \div h$), forgetting that brackets bind terms together. **Option B** is a relatively rare "copying error" or a confused attempt to balance both sides of the fraction.

In the UK curriculum, notation is taught early in Key Stage 3. Because the brackets are explicitly present in the question, they act as a "container" that guides many students to keep $h+4$ together. This makes the question slightly more accessible than one where the brackets might be implicit.
