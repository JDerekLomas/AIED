This is an exceptionally straightforward addition of mixed numbers because the denominators are the same and the sum of the fractional parts does not exceed a whole. However, the constraints and the nature of "typical" errors in a multiple-choice format will still split the lower-ability cohorts.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **The Trap (Option D):** This is the classic fraction addition misconception—adding both the numerators and the denominators. Even in simple questions, "below_basic" students consistently perform $5 + 5 = 10$.
*   **The Trap (Option B):** This is the correct numerical value but in the "improper" form. The instruction explicitly asks for a "mixed number." Proficient students will notice this; "basic" students may see it, think it’s right, and stop looking.
*   **The Trap (Option C):** This represents a student who adds denominators and fails to handle the whole numbers correctly (possibly just converting $18/10$).
*   **Option A:** Most students find this intuitive as $2+1=3$ and $1/5+2/5=3/5$ is a natural left-to-right process.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=65% B=15% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=88% B=7% C=1% D=4%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
