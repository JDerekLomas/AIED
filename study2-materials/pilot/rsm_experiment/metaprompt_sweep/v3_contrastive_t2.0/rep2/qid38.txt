As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question on adding algebraic fractions with unequal denominators.

**Teacher Analysis:**
The most common mistake for lower-ability students is "adding across" (numerator + numerator, denominator + denominator), leading to option B. Option D represents the error of adding the numerators but forgetting to adjust the second fraction's denominator to $2x$ (keeping the original "largest" denominator without multiplying). Option A is the correct answer ($\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$), requiring the student to recognise that $4/x$ is equivalent to $8/2x$. Option C is a rarer error where the student mistakenly halves the denominator rather than doubling the numerator of the second term.

This question is a "gatekeeper" for proficiency. Many "Basic" students will jump straight to $7/3x$.

below_basic: A=15% B=55% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
