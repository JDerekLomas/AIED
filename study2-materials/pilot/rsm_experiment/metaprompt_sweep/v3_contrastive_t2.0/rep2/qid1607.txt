In this question, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4), but Step 2 contains a common procedural error. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60, Isaac has added 1 to 60.

**Analysis of student performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with multi-step inverse operations. Many will see "minus 1" logic but apply it backwards or simply guess based on the numbers provided.
*   **Basic:** This group is the most likely to fall for the trap. They recognise that Step 1 "looks right" (clearing the fraction), but they frequently fail to spot the sign error in Step 2, assuming that since 60 and 1 are involved, 61 is a logical next step. They often equate "doing something with the 1" with "being correct."
*   **Proficient:** These students usually have a solid grasp of inverse operations ($60 - 1 = 59$). They will carefully check the transition between Step 1 and Step 2 and identify that Isaac added instead of subtracted.
*   **Advanced:** These students will solve the equation mentally in seconds and immediately identify that $k=59$, making Step 2 an obvious error.

**Difficulties of this specific question:** 
The trap is subtle because Step 1 is a perfectly standard first move. Many students look at the flow of work and see $60$ and $1$ and intuitively accept $61$ without verifying the inverse operation $(+1$ becoming $-1)$.
