As a UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because it tests three distinct procedural concepts simultaneously: the inclusion of zero in a mean, the divisor count, and the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS).

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **Option A (Correct):** Adding 0 doesn't change the sum, but dividing by 5 is the correct denominator. This is the mathematically sound way to express the mean of 5 numbers even if one is zero.
*   **Option B (BIDMAS Trap):** This represents a "calculator error." Many students write this expression exactly as shown, forgetting that without brackets, only the 7 is being divided by 5. 
*   **Option C (Zero Misconception):** This is the most common error regarding zeros; students often feel that because zero doesn't add value, it "doesn't count" as a piece of data.
*   **Option D (The "Technical" Trap):** Advanced students might choose this if they feel A is "incomplete" because the 0 is missing from the numerator, but usually, they recognise that adding 0 is identity.

**Student Performance Predictions:**

*   **Below Basic:** These students struggle with the definition of the mean and are highly susceptible to "intuitive" errors. Many will pick C because they see four non-zero numbers.
*   **Basic:** This group usually knows "add them up and divide by how many there are." However, the exclusion of the '0' in the numerator of A will make them hesitate, often leading them to C or B.
*   **Proficient:** These students recognise that the zero must be included in the count (the divisor), so they will eliminate C. Some will fall for the BIDMAS trap (B) if they aren't looking closely at the notation.
*   **Advanced:** These students recognise that $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$ is equivalent to $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$. They will spot the lack of brackets in B and correctly identify A as the only viable mathematical expression.

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=50% D=5%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=3% C=2% D=3%
