To answer this question correctly, a student must navigate two distinct conceptual hurdles: reciprocal multiplication (multiplying a fraction by its inverse to get 1) and directed number rules (the sign of the product).

The trap in this specific question lies in the target value being $-1$ rather than $+1$. Usually, students learn that a number times its reciprocal equals $1$. Because the left-hand side is already negative, many students will intuitively feel they have the "negative covered" and will reach for the positive reciprocal $4/3$ to maintain the sign. This makes Option A a very strong distractor for proficient students who know how to invert but overlook the second negative needed to result in $-1$.

Option B is the correct answer. 
Option C is common for basic-level students who understand that $3/4$ is "related" but don't know about reciprocals.
Option D is chosen by students who think they are "balancing" the equation by repeating the value.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=35% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=45% B=45% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=10% B=88% C=1% D=1%
