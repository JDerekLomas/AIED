As an experienced UK maths teacher, I identify this question as testing three distinct concepts: substitution, order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), and decimal arithmetic.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **A ($0.81$):** This is the result of squaring $(3x)$, i.e., $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2$. It tests the common misconception of multiplying by the coefficient before applying the index.
*   **B ($0.27$):** The correct answer. $0.3^2 = 0.09$, and $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.
*   **C ($1.8$):** This represents $2(3x)$ or perhaps $(3 \times 2) \times 0.3$. It targets students who confuse squaring with multiplying by 2.
*   **D ($2.7$):** This is a very common "decimal point" error where the student squares $0.3$ and gets $0.9$ (failing to realise $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$), then multiplies $0.9$ by 3 to get $2.7$.

**Challenges:** The "hidden" difficulty is the decimal squaring. Many students "know" to square before they multiply (indices before multiplication), but a significant number of Proficient and Basic students will think $0.3^2 = 0.9$. This makes **D** a very high-drawing distractor.
