As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this question by identifying two primary points of failure: the index laws (understanding that $k^4$ means $k \times k \times k \times k$) and the handling of negative bases with even exponents.

**The "Low-Ability Trap":** Below-basic students frequently mistake indices for multipliers ($3 \times 4 = 12$). Since the base is negative, many will pick $-12$ (Option D) over $+12$ (Option B).

**The "Middle-Ability Trap":** Proficient students know that $3^4 = 81$, but they often struggle with the sign when substituting into an algebraic expression. A very common misconception is that $-3^4$ is $-81$, either due to calculator input errors (typing $-3^4$ instead of $(-3)^4$) or the mistaken belief that an initial negative sign is always preserved regardless of the power.

**Advanced Students:** They should recognize that an even exponent results in a positive value.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=35% D=15%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=22% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
