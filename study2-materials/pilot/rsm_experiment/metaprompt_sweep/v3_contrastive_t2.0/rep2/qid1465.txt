This order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) question is a classic "trap" for students who follow mnemonic acronyms too rigidly. 

The primary hurdle is the multi-stage calculation: $3 - 5 + 8$. Many students mistakenly believe Addition ($A$) must come before Subtraction ($S$) because of the order of letters in the acronym. This leads them to calculate $5 + 8 = 13$ first, followed by $3 - 13 = -10$ (Option D). Others will work left-to-right regardless of operations ($3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$) leading to Option B. Option C is a result of $3-9 \times 2$ or similar grouped calculation errors.

For **below_basic** students, working left-to-right (Option B) is the most instinctive approach. For **basic/proficient** students, the "Addition before Subtraction" misconception (Option D) is the most common pitfall in UK classrooms.

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=5% D=50%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=2% D=23%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=0% D=3%
