This question is a classic test of whether students understand the order of operations when solving multi-step equations and how they apply "the same to both sides."

**Tom’s approach** is the conventional one taught in UK schools: undoing the subtraction by adding 5 to both sides. Most students recognize this easily.

**Katie’s approach** is the common pitfall. To get \(x - 5 = 36\), she has multiplied the \(\frac{x}{3}\) and the \(12\) by 3, but failed to multiply the \(-5\) by 3. This is one of the most persistent misconceptions in GCSE algebra (forgetting to multiply every term by the denominator).

- **Below Basic** students often guess C because "both looks right" or because they see Katie's numbers "look like they work" ($12 \times 3 = 36$). 
- **Basic** students will see Tom is definitely right, and because they struggle with fractions, they often think Katie’s "shortcut" of just moving the 3 is also valid.
- **Proficient** students usually spot Katie’s error because they have been warned specifically about multiplying every term when "clearing" a fraction.
- **Advanced** students will confidently identify that only Tom followed the rules of algebraic equality.
