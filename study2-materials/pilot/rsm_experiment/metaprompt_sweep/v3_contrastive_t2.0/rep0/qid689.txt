This question is a classic test of algebraic manipulation involving denominators. The difficulty lies in the fact that the variable is on the bottom of the fraction. 

Students at lower ability levels often view the relationship as a multiplication ($10 \times 5 = 50$) or simply perform the division the "easier" way ($10 \div 5 = 2$). Choice C ($p=2$) is the most common distractor because students see the numbers 10 and 5 and perform the calculation $10 \div 5$ without considering the position of $p$. Choice A is the correct answer ($10p = 5$, so $p = 5/10 = 0.5$), but it requires a two-step manipulation or a strong grasp of proportional reasoning that many students lacks.

The specific numbers here are particularly tricky because $10/5 = 2$ and $5/10 = 0.5$ are both plausible "simple" results, making the $p=2$ trap very effective.
