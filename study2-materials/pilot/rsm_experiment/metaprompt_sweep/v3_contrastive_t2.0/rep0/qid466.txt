This question specifically tests two key concepts: the property of **multiplicative inverses (reciprocals)** and the **rules for multiplying negative numbers**.

The difficulty lies in the fact that a student must correctly apply two "flips" simultaneously. They must recognize that to get the magnitude of 1, the fraction must be inverted ($4/3$). Crucially, they must then remember that a negative multiplied by a **positive** stays negative ($-\times+=-$). Many students, having been drilled that "two negatives make a positive," will incorrectly choose the negative version (Option B) because they see the negative result and assume a second negative is required, or they confuse this with the rule for obtaining a positive 1 ($-\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{4}{3} = 1$).

**A** is the correct answer. **B** is the strongest distractor, attracting those who know it's a reciprocal but get muddled by the signs. **C** and **D** are chosen by students who lack an understanding of multiplicative inverses and are just repeating the numbers they see.
