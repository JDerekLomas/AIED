As an experienced teacher, I identify this question as a classic test of negative number arithmetic within algebra. While the FOIL method (First, Outside, Inside, Last) is well-rehearsed by most UK students, the specific interaction of two negative constants presents three distinct opportunities for error:
1.  **The "Middle" Term:** Calculating $-5m - 7m$. Students often confuse addition/subtraction rules with multiplication rules (the "two minuses make a plus" trap applied to $-5-7$).
2.  **The "Last" Term:** Calculating $-5 \times -7$. Students may correctly sum to $-12$ but then incorrectly result in $-35$ for the multiplication.
3.  **Sign Selection:** Option A targets the specific error of finding the difference between 7 and 5 rather than the sum.

**Teacher's analysis of the options:**
-   **A:** Chosen by students who think $-7 + 5 = -2$.
-   **B:** The correct answer.
-   **C:** Chosen by students who think $-5-7 = +12$ (or those who ignore signs entirely).
-   **D:** A very common error; the student gets the middle term right but forgets that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive.

Below are the predicted percentages based on typical classroom performance in the UK (e.g., Year 10/11):

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
