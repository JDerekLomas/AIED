As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this question based on how students handle equations in implicit form (where $y$ isn't the subject) and the specific behavior of substituting zero.

The trap here isn't the substitution itself, but the manipulation of the $+2y$. Many lower-ability students see "$4x+2y=10$" and "$x=0$" and intuitively perform $10/4$ (leading to $2.5$) because they are used to one-step equations or focus on the first coefficient they see. Others may simply see the $10$ and the $2$ and subtract/divide incorrectly, or try to solve $4+y=10$. 

However, substituting $0$ usually simplifies the expression to $2y=10$. This "covering up" method is often taught well in UK classrooms for finding intercepts. 

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) 20:** A product of 4 and 5, or 10 times 2. Unlikely for anyone except those guessing.
*   **B) 3:** Result of a "substitution error" where students treat $4x+2y$ as $(4+x) + (2+y)$ or similar confusion, or potentially subtracting 4 then dividing by 2 ($10-4=6; 6/2=3$).
*   **C) 5:** **The correct answer.** $(4 \times 0) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 10 \rightarrow y = 5$.
*   **D) 2.5:** Result of $10 \div 4$. This is a very common error where students associate the $x$ coefficient with the total, ignoring the $y$ coefficient.
