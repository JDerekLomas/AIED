To predict student performance on this question, we must look at the algebraic manipulation of the sphere volume formula: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

This is a classic "changing the subject" question. The main difficulty lies in the two-step process of isolating $r^3$: first, multiplying by 3 and then dividing by $4\pi$. Students frequently struggle with whether the $\pi$ belongs in the numerator or denominator when rearranged. 

*   **Option C** is the correct rearrangement ($3V / 4\pi$).
*   **Option B** is a common error where the student knows $\pi$ goes in the denominator but forgets the coefficient flip or gets confused with the order of operations.
*   **Option A** is the "multiplying everything" error, common among lower-ability students who struggle with inverse operations.
*   **Option D** represents a failure to understand that the cube root applies to the entire expression, not just $V$.

This question is harder than it looks because it is purely algebraic; there are no numbers to work with, which prevents students from "back-solving" or using trial and error.
