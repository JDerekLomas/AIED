As an experienced teacher, I've seen many versions of this question. This is a classic "trapped fraction" equation. While students know they need to divide by 3, the mental processing of dividing a unit fraction by a whole number is a significant hurdle.

Option **A** ($1/4$) is the most common attractor for struggling students; they see 3 and 12 and instinctively perform $12 \div 3$. Even those who try to "divide by 3" often accidentally multiply $1/12 \times 3$ due to a misunderstanding of the relationship between division and fractions.

Option **C** (4) is for students who essentially ignore the fraction structure or incorrectly rearrange it to $3p = 12$.

The "Basic" level is where the highest error rate occurs because these students have a procedural "feel" for algebra but struggle with fraction arithmetic operations.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
