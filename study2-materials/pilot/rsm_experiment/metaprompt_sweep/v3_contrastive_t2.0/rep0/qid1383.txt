This question is a classic test of two distinct areas: the rules of indices (specifically even powers) and the treatment of negative bases.

For students at the **below_basic** level, the primary hurdle is the index itself. Many will treat $k^4$ as $k \times 4$, leading to answers involving 12. Because the base is negative, they often simply carry the negative sign through to their answer (D).

For students at the **basic** and **proficient** levels, the "trap" shifts. Most know that $3^4 = 81$, but there is a persistent misconception regarding negative numbers and powers. Students are often taught that "a negative times a negative is a positive," but they struggle when applying this to a chain of four numbers. Even more significant is the "calculator error" phenomenon: many students (and some teachers) forget that $-3^4$ is $-81$ while $(-3)^4$ is $81$. In the context of substitution ($k=-3$), the entire value should be squared, but students frequently select -81 because they process it as $-(3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3)$.

**Advanced** students generally recognize that an even power result must be positive and will navigate the substitution correctly.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=5% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=2% C=26% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
