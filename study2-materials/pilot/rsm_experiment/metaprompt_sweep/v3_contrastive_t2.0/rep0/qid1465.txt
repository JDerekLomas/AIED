This question focuses on the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). While it looks simple, it contains two primary "traps":

1.  **Multiplication Priority:** Students who calculate left-to-right regardless of operator will compute $(3-5+4) \times 2 = 4$ (Option B).
2.  **The Addition/Subtraction Trap:** This is the most common error in UK schools. Students who believe 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS will calculate $5+4=9$ first, leading to $3-9+8$, or $3-(5+8)$ etc. However, the most likely error path for a mid-level student is ignoring the negative sign on the 5: $3 - (5+8) = -10$ (Option D) or $3 - 9 + 8 = 2$ (not listed).
3.  **The Correct Path:** $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 + 8$. Many students find $3-5$ tricky because it moves into negative integers, though $3-5+8$ is the same as $8+3-5=6$.

**Option A (6)** is the correct answer.
**Option B (4)** is the "Left-to-Right" error.
**Option C (-12)** is a result of $3 - (5+4) \times 2 = 3 - 18 = -15$ (miscalculated) or other variations of incorrect grouping.
**Option D (-10)** is a common "Add then Subtract" error combined with a multiplication misstep or sign error.
