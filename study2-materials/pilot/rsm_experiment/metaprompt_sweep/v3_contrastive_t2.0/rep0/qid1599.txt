This question tests a student's ability to translate linear algebraic division into fractional notation, specifically focusing on how brackets (grouping) interact with the vinculum (the fraction bar).

While the concept is foundational, students at the lower end often struggle with "visual" grouping. Option C is a classic distractor for students who ignore brackets and simply translate left-to-right, while Option D catches those who confuse the dividend and the divisor (numerator vs. denominator). Option B is a "distractor by proximity," where students incorrectly think the $+4$ must be applied to both parts of the expression.

Because the brackets are explicit in the question, "Proficient" and "Advanced" students will find this very straightforward. The main "trap" is Option D, as some students see a group $(h+4)$ as "more substantial" and instinctively put it on top.

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=70% B=5% C=12% D=13%
proficient: A=88% B=2% C=4% D=6%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
