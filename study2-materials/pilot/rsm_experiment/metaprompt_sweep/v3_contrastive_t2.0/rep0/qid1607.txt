In this equation, Isaac correctly handles the multiplication in Step 1 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). However, in Step 2, he commits a very common "operation reversal" error. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$ ($60 - 1 = 59$), he sees the "$+ 1$" and instinctively adds it to the other side ($60 + 1 = 61$).

For **below basic** students, the correct first step often lures them into thinking the whole process is correct (Option C), as they struggle to verify the final substitution. **Basic** students are the most likely to fall for the trap in Step 2; they recognise Step 1 is right, but their shaky grasp of inverse operations leads them to believe $60+1=61$ is the correct way to "move" the 1. **Proficient** students usually spot the sign error in Step 2. **Advanced** students will quickly solve the equation mentally ($59$) and identify that only Step 1 aligns with the correct path.
