As an experienced teacher, I analyze this question as a test of two specific concepts: the role of zero in a data set and the understanding of mathematical hierarchy (BIDMAS).

Many lower-ability students forget that 0 is a data point, leading them to choose C (dividing by 4). Middle-ability students often understand that 0 should be included in the sum and the count, making Option A mathematically correct. The "trap" for higher-ability students is Option B; they recognize that without brackets, BIDMAS/BODMAS rules mean only the 7 is divided by 5, making the expression incorrect. However, very low-ability students may choose B simply because it "looks" like the steps they take on a calculator. Option D is a distractor for those who are over-thinking the absence of 0 in the numerator of A (even though adding 0 doesn't change the sum).

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=1% D=5%
