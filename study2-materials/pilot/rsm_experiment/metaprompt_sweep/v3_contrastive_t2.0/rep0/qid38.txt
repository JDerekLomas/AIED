To solve this problem, a student must find a common denominator (2x). They need to multiply the second fraction by 2/2 to get 8/2x. Adding this to 3/2x gives 11/2x.

**Analysis of Difficulty and Misconceptions:**
*   **The "Add everything" trap (Option B):** This is the classic error for adding any fractions ($3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$). Students at lower ability levels often apply this "freshman's dream" logic.
*   **The "Half-Common Denominator" trap (Option D):** Many students see the 2x and x and simply add the numerators ($3+4=7$) while picking the "best looking" denominator ($2x$). This is very common for students who understand that denominators must stay the same but forget to scale the numerator.
*   **The "Double Numerator" trap (Option C):** A student might correctly scale the second numerator to 8 but then think the $x$ cancels or that $2x$ and $x$ somehow combine into just $x$.
*   **A is the correct answer.**

In the UK context (GCSE Foundation/Higher), students at "below basic" rarely handle algebraic fractions correctly and will gravitate toward B. "Basic" students often forget to change the numerator (D). "Proficient" students usually remember the method but occasionally make arithmetic slips. "Advanced" students almost never miss this.

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=82% B=5% C=3% D=10%
advanced: A=97% B=1% C=1% D=1%
