As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific question as a diagnostic tool for three distinct areas: integer multiplication (negative $\times$ negative), operations vs. calculations (the "$-1$ minus $4$" trap), and basic numeracy.

This is a "pure" test of signs. The numbers themselves are very simple ($1$ and $4$), which actually makes it easier for students to fall into the "additive" trap (Option D) because $1+4=5$ is such a strong primary bond.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **Option A (+4):** Correct. $-1 \times -4 = +4$.
*   **Option B (-4):** The most common mistake for middle-attaining students. They know they need to multiply $1 \times 4$, but they forget that "a minus times a minus is a plus" or believe one minus sign in the result is sufficient.
*   **Option D (-5):** The "Addition Trap." Below-basic students often see $-1$ and $-4$ and perform $-1 - 4$. This is a very common error when students are overwhelmed by the concept of FOIL/expanding and default to basic combining.
*   **Option C (+5):** Rare. Usually occurs from students who think they should add the numbers and then change the sign because they have a vague memory that "two negatives make a positive."

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=5% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=35% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=12% C=1% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
