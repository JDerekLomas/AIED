As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as being on the "easy" side of fraction addition because the denominators are the same and the sum of the fractional parts does not cross a whole number (i.e., there is no "carrying" or renaming required).

The most significant distractor here isn't a calculation error, but a failure to follow the specific instruction: **"Leave your answer as a mixed number."** Option B is mathematically equivalent but is an improper fraction. Option D targets the most common misconception in fraction addition (adding the denominators). Option C combines adding the denominators with a total failure of integer addition or a misunderstood conversion.

**Teacher's Insight:**
*   **Below Basic** students often treat fractions as two separate whole numbers separated by a line; they will likely choose D.
*   **Basic/Proficient** students know how to add these but are the most likely to get "distractor fatigue" and pick B if they converted to improper fractions to solve it, forgetting to convert back as requested.
*   **Advanced** students will see this as trivial and will be careful enough to provide the mixed number requested in the prompt.

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=97% B=2% C=0% D=1%
