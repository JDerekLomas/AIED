As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) question as follows:

The LHS ($8 + 12 \div 4$) is the primary trap. Students at lower ability levels almost instinctively read left-to-right, performing $8+12$ first to get $20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$. If they do this, they see both sides as equal (Option C). The RHS is "protected" by brackets, so even those who don't know the priority rules will likely calculate it correctly as $(20) \div 4 = 5$. 

Therefore, the main competition is between A (the correct calculation: $8 + 3 = 11$, and $11 > 5$) and C (the left-to-right misconception). Option B is less likely but attracts those who might confuse the symbols or believe brackets always make a value "bigger". Option D is rarely chosen by students in this context as they expect a definitive inequality or equality.

**Breakdown of predictions:**

*   **Below Basic:** High prevalence of left-to-right processing. Over 50% will calculate $20 \div 4$ on both sides and choose $=$.
*   **Basic:** Still a strong pull toward left-to-right, but some recognition that brackets "change things", leading to a split between the correct answer and the mistake.
*   **Proficient:** Most understand BIDMAS but under exam pressure, a small percentage will still revert to left-to-right reading.
*   **Advanced:** Should consistently apply the rules. Errors here are rare and usually down to rushing.

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=55% D=5%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=42% D=3%
proficient: A=82% B=5% C=12% D=1%
advanced: A=97% B=1% C=2% D=0%
