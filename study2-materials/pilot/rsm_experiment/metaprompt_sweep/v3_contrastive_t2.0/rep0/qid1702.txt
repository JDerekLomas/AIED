To solve this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into $10x - 6y = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, and finally $x = 3.3$.

**Analysis:**
This question contains several points of friction. First, the student must identify which variable to substitute; since $0.5$ is in the $y$ row, they must replace $y$. Second, the multiplication $6 \times 0.5$ is a common trap (some students may double it to 12 or simply append the digits). Third, and most crucially, the algebraic manipulation: many lower-ability students will subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it (leading to $x=2.7$), or miscalculate the subtraction entirely. Option A ($4.25$) often comes from students incorrectly rearranging the equation to $6y - 10x$ or making a significant division error. 

Option C ($3.3$) is the correct answer. Option D ($2.7$) is the most "attractive" distractor for students who understand substitution but fail the inverse operation ($30 - 3$ instead of $30 + 3$).
