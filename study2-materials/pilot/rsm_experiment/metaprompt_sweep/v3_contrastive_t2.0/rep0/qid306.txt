This question addresses two major pillars of order of operations: the priority of multiplication over addition (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the "left-to-right" rule for operators of equal priority (Addition and Subtraction).

Problem P ($4-5+6$) is the "trap" for UK students. Many are taught the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS where 'A' comes before 'S'. This leads to a very common misconception that addition must *always* be performed before subtraction. Students who follow the acronym literally will erroneously pick "5+6" as the first step.

Problem Q ($4+5 \times 6$) is a standard order of priority check. Most students from "Basic" level upwards know that multiplication comes before addition.

**The Breakdown:**
*   **Option B (Correct):** Students recognize $4-5$ comes first because subtraction and addition have equal priority (left-to-right), and $5 \times 6$ comes first due to BIDMAS.
*   **Option D (The Acronym Trap):** This is the most common error. It attracts students who follow the BIDMAS acronym rigidly, believing 'A' always precedes 'S', while still understanding the rule for multiplication.
*   **Option A/C:** These represent a fundamental lack of understanding regarding multiplication's priority, which is less common once students reach secondary school (KS3).

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=35% C=5% D=50%
proficient: A=2% B=60% C=3% D=35%
advanced: A=0% B=92% C=1% D=7%
