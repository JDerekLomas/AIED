This question is a classic test of the hierarchy of operations and "clearing the fraction" in linear equations. 

**Tom** follows the standard practice of "adding 5 to both sides" first. This is the path most students are taught and is intuitive because it isolates the term containing $x$. Most students will recognise this as correct.

**Katie** attempts to multiply by 3 first. For this to be correct, she must multiply *every* term by 3 ($x - 15 = 36$). Her error is a extremely common "misconception trap" where students only multiply the fraction and the right-hand side, forgetting the constant on the left. 

Because many students at **Basic** and **Below Basic** levels share Katie's specific misconception (forgetting to multiply the -5 by 3), they will likely believe she is also correct, leading them to choose **C**. At the **Proficient** level, students start to realise that if you multiply by the denominator, you must multiply the whole side, making **A** the most common correct choice.

below_basic: A=25% B=10% C=50% D=15%
basic: A=45% B=5% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=2% C=20% D=3%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=4% D=1%
