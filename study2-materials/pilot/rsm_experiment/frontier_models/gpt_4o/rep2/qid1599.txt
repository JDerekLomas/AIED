In considering the typical issues encountered by students at different ability levels on this question:

- Choice A is correct and represents what's required in using correct algebraic notation.
- Choice B might be selected by students inefficiently trying to apply both the division operation and the component of adding 4 due to a misunderstanding of the expression's structure.
- Choice C could appeal to those misunderstanding the grouping and storing 'h' and '4' disjointly under division, where it is splitting original contexts incorrectly.
- Choice D appears to reverse operable components inappropriately and may draw less traction with analytical barriers so as relatively to signal an explicit treated convention flaw.
