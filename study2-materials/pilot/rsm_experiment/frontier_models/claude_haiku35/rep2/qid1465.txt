Let me break this down systematically:

Correct Solution: 
3 - 5 + (4 × 2) = 3 - 5 + 8 = 6

Error Analysis:
- Below basic students likely ignore order of operations completely
- Basic students might do left-to-right calculation or struggle with multiplication precedence
- Proficient students more likely to make small calculation errors
- Advanced students should solve this correctly

Predicted distributions:

below_basic: A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%
(Many will do left-to-right: 3-5=−2, then −2+4×2=−2+8=6 or similar random errors)

basic: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
(More awareness of multiplication priority, but still prone to calculation errors)

proficient: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
(Most likely to make the specific error of 3-5+4×2 = 3-5+8 = -10)

advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
(Almost all will solve correctly, with a few occasional slips)
