Let me break this down step-by-step:

1. Correct solution: 
\( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \)
\( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \)
\( x = 51 \)

Tom's method: \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \) ✓ Correct

Katie's method: 
\( x - 5 = 36 \)
\( x = 41 \) ✗ Incorrect

Predicted error patterns:

Below Basic:
- High chance of random guessing
- Less systematic thinking
A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%

Basic:
- Some understanding of rearranging
- More likely to make procedural errors
A=25% B=40% C=15% D=20%

Proficient:
- More careful algebraic manipulation
- Can spot methodological differences
A=15% B=20% C=50% D=15%

Advanced:
- Precise algebraic reasoning
- Understand exact steps
A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%

Final prediction:
