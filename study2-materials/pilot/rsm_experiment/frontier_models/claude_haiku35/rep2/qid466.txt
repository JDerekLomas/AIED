Let me break this down systematically:

Error Analysis:
- Correct solution: ★ = \( \frac{4}{3} \) (solve by dividing both sides by -3/4)
- Typical student errors:

Below Basic (struggling):
- Likely to guess randomly
- Might invert fractions without understanding
- Won't systematically solve

Basic (procedural but shaky):
- Might just divide 1 by 3/4 incorrectly
- Likely to choose based on "feeling" the signs match
- High chance of choosing negative options

Proficient (mostly correct):
- Will mostly solve correctly
- Small chance of sign errors
- Might momentarily doubt themselves

Advanced (confident):
- Will solve precisely
- Least likely to make errors

Predicted Distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=35% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%

The key insight: As mathematical skill increases, precision increases dramatically.
