Let me break this down systematically:

Correct solution is A) \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \)

below_basic (struggling students):
- Likely to make simple addition errors
- Might not understand mixed number conversion
- Probably scattered across options
A=10% B=40% C=35% D=15%

basic (students with some skills):
- More likely to attempt correct method
- But prone to mistakes in denominator handling
A=25% B=30% C=30% D=15%

proficient (solid understanding):
- Will mostly get correct answer
- Small chance of minor computational slip
A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%

advanced (top performers):
- Guaranteed correct method
- Will systematically convert and add
A=90% B=3% C=3% D=4%

My reasoning:
- Option B (\( \frac{18}{5} \)) looks like "just adding numerators"
- Option C (\( \frac{18}{10} \)) suggests denominator confusion
- Option D suggests a common computational error in adding fractions
- Increasing student skill means decreasing wrong answer spread
