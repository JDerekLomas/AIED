Let me analyze this systematically:

Problem P (4-5+6):
- Correct order is left-to-right: 4-5 first, then +6
- Lower ability students often struggle with signed operations
- Might try "add first" or get confused by negative numbers

Problem Q (4+5×6):
- Multiplication takes precedence over addition
- Correct order is 5×6 first, then add 4
- Very common error is calculating left-to-right

Predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
- High confusion
- Many will do left-to-right
- Struggle with order of operations

basic: A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%
- More students understand multiplication priority
- Still significant left-to-right errors
- Partial understanding of BODMAS

proficient: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
- Clear understanding of multiplication priority
- Most select B for problem Q
- Some lingering confusion in problem P

advanced: A=5% B=75% C=10% D=10%
- Near-perfect understanding
- Confidently apply order of operations
- Minimal random errors
