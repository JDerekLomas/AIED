Let me analyze this carefully, thinking through student reasoning:

Correct solution: 
• Multiply both sides by 4: 15 × 4 = 1 + k
• 60 = 1 + k
• 59 = k

Now, let's predict student errors:

Below Basic (lower ability):
- Likely to guess randomly
- Might be confused by multiple steps
A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%

Basic (developing skills):
- Will likely recognize first step looks correct (multiplying by 4)
- Less likely to check final arithmetic carefully
A=40% B=15% C=10% D=35%

Proficient (solid understanding):
- Will carefully trace algebraic manipulation
- More likely to spot the arithmetic error in final step
A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%

Advanced (high performers):
- Will methodically solve and verify each step
- Immediately spot the error at step 2
A=5% B=2% C=2% D=91%

Key reasoning:
- Common error is not checking final arithmetic
- Multiplying both sides by 4 feels correct
- Final subtraction/rearrangement trips up many students
