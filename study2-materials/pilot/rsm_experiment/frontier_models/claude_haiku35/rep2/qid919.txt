Let me walk through my reasoning:

Correct solution: y = 3x² 
Substituting x = 0.3:
y = 3 * (0.3)²
   = 3 * 0.09
   = 0.27 (Option B)

Error analysis:
- Below basic students will likely:
  * Randomly guess
  * Struggle with decimals
  * Might just multiply 3 * 0.3

- Basic students will:
  * Potentially square first wrong
  * Might multiply 3 * 0.3 = 0.9
  * Or do 3 * 3 = 9

- Proficient students might:
  * Accidentally use 3x instead of 3x²
  * Miscalculate squaring

- Advanced students should get this correct consistently

Predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%

The key is option B (0.27) becomes increasingly dominant as student ability increases.
