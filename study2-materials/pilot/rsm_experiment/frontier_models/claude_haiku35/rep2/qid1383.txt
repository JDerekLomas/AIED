Let me break this down step-by-step:

Correct solution: \( (-3)^4 = 81 \)

Predicted error patterns:
- Below basic students will likely:
  * Forget how negative numbers work with even powers
  * Randomly guess or choose the first option that looks plausible
  * Be very uncertain

- Basic students will:
  * Often get confused about sign when raising negatives to even powers
  * Might do \( (-3)^4 = -3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3 \) incorrectly
  * More likely to choose negative options

- Proficient students:
  * Will mostly know even powers make negatives positive
  * Small risk of calculation slip-ups
  * Less likely to make sign errors

- Advanced students:
  * Will solve this confidently and precisely
  * Almost certain to choose correct answer

Predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=2% D=2%
