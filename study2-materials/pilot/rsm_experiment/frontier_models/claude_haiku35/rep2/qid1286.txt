I'll analyze this systematically:

Correct Answer: A) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \)

Recall the sphere volume formula: V = (4/3)πr³

Solving for r: r = \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}} \)

Error Analysis:
B) Swaps π in denominator - common "cancellation" mistake
C) Transposed 4/3 - looks algebraically similar
D) Completely different structure - suggests fundamental misunderstanding

Predicted Distributions:
