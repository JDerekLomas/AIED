Let me walk through my reasoning before giving the prediction:

Correct solution:
1) Convert mixed numbers to improper fractions
   \( 2 \frac{7}{10} = \frac{27}{10} \)
   \( 2 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \)
2) Find common denominator (20)
   \( \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} \)
3) Convert back to mixed number: \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \)

Error analysis:
- Option A (\( \frac{99}{20} \)) is the intermediate fraction before converting back
- Option C looks like a denominator multiplication error
- Option D suggests students might incorrectly add denominators

Predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=35% B=10% C=40% D=15%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

The key is that more advanced students will methodically convert and check.
