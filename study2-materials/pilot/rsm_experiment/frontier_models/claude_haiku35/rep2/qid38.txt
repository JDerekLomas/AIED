Let me break this down systematically:

Common Student Errors:
1. Option A (\( \frac{11}{2x} \)): Correct method, but miscalculated. Students add numerators without finding common denominator.
   - "Quick thinking" students who see 3/2x and 4/x and just add 3+4=11

2. Option B (\( \frac{7}{3x} \)): Complete misunderstanding of fraction addition
   - Randomly combining parts without mathematical logic

3. Option C (\( \frac{11}{x} \)): Another "quick addition" error, just removing denominator
   - Very common misconception among weaker students

4. Option D (\( \frac{7}{2x} \)): Closest to correct method, suggests partial understanding

Predicted Distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=20% D=25%
proficient: A=15% B=5% C=5% D=75%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%

The progression shows increasing mathematical sophistication, with advanced students almost universally selecting the correct approach.
