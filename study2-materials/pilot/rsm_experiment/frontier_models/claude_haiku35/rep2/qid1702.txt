Let me analyze this systematically:

Key steps:
1. Rearrange equation: y = (10x - 30)/6
2. Substitute y = 0.5: 
   0.5 = (10x - 30)/6

Potential student errors:

Below Basic (struggling):
- Random guessing
- Will likely spread answers somewhat evenly
- Might lean towards simple/round numbers

Basic (basic algebra issues):
- Common error: 10x - 30 = 0.5 * 6
  This leads to incorrect calculations
- Likely to choose A or B without careful work

Proficient (minor calculation errors):
- Most will solve correctly
- Some might make sign/arithmetic mistakes
- More likely to choose a "close" answer

Advanced (systematic solvers):
- Will solve methodically
- Least likely to make errors

Prediction:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%

The solution is solving 0.5 = (10x - 30)/6, which gives x = 2.7.
