Let me walk through my reasoning:

Below Basic (struggling students):
- Likely to make simple substitution errors
- May not understand how to rearrange the equation
- Might randomly guess or pick familiar-looking numbers
- Will probably be drawn to option B (3), as it's a simple small number

Basic (students with some skills):
- Will substitute x=0 into 4x+2y=10
- Many will initially get 4(0)+2y=10
- Solving 2y=10 gives y=5
- So they'll correctly recognize C (5) is the right answer

Proficient (solid understanding):
- Will carefully verify solution
- Most will solve correctly as per basic students
- A small subset might make calculation errors

Advanced (top students):
- Will solve systematically
- Check solutions completely
- Zero likelihood of making calculation errors

Predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=35% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
