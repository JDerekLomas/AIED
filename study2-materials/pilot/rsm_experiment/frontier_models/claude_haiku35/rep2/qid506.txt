Let me break this down carefully, considering typical student thinking:

Below Basic (struggling students):
- Will likely choose randomly or get confused
- Might divide/multiply incorrectly
- Prediction:
A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%

Basic (procedural understanding):
- Will recognize they need to divide by 3
- Common error: dividing incorrectly
- Prediction:
A=45% B=15% C=20% D=20%

Proficient (solid understanding):
- Know to divide 1/12 by 3 correctly
- Some careful checks happening
- Prediction:
A=75% B=5% C=10% D=10%

Advanced (confident manipulators):
- Will solve instantly and precisely
- Double-check work
- Prediction:
A=90% B=2% C=4% D=4%

Key reasoning:
- Correct answer (A) requires dividing 1/12 by 3
- Attractive wrong answers involve basic multiplication/division errors
- Students progressively get better at catching their own mistakes
