Let me break this down systematically:

Correct Answer: A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)

Below Basic (low understanding):
- Will likely choose randomly or follow a superficial "pattern"
- Might be confused by the division symbol
A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%

Basic (some algebraic understanding):
- Most likely to make common errors
- Option B looks tempting (adding 4 to numerator)
- Option C suggests a misunderstanding of division
A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%

Proficient (solid algebraic skills):
- Will recognize correct division representation
- More systematic about checking conventions
A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%

Advanced (strong algebraic reasoning):
- Will immediately recognize correct notation
- Least likely to make careless errors
A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%

So my full prediction:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
