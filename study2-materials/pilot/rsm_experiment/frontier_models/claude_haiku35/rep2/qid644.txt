Let me analyze this systematically:

Correct calculation: (-1)(-4) = +4

Likely error patterns:
- Below basic: Random guessing or no real understanding
- Basic: Likely to forget signed number multiplication rules
- Proficient: Might overthink or rush
- Advanced: Should get this correctly

Predicted error traps:
- Multiplying just the numbers without considering signs
- Forgetting (-)(-)=+ rule
- Confusing with other parts of the expansion

Predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%

Reasoning:
- Below basic: High spread of random/incorrect choices
- Basic: High chance of getting sign wrong (option B)
- Proficient: More likely to get correct, but still some confusion
- Advanced: Very high likelihood of getting correct answer

The key is the signed number multiplication rule that (-1)(-4) = +4.
