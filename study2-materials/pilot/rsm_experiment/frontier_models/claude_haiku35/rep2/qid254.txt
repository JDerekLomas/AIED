Let me break this down carefully:

Key Misconceptions:
- Option A: Correctly adds numerator, but correctly divides by total numbers (5)
- Option B: Fundamentally wrong order of operations - adds then divides
- Option C: Adds same numerator but divides by (4) instead of (5), omitting zero
- Option D: Requires recognizing all other options are incorrect

Predicted Student Behaviors:
- Below Basic: High chance of mechanical errors, likely random selection
- Basic: Will struggle with zero and understanding denominator
- Proficient: Should solve correctly
- Advanced: Will deliberately check method

Prediction:

below_basic: A=35% B=30% C=25% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=5% D=70%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%

Rationale:
- Most students forget to include zero
- Some will randomly divide by wrong number
- More advanced students carefully check full method
- Sophisticated students will choose "None" after thorough checking
