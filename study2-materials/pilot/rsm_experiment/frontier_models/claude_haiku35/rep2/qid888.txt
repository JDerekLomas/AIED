Let me walk through my reasoning carefully:

Correct method is: (m-5)(m-7) = m² - 7m - 5m + 35 = m² - 12m + 35 (Option B)

below_basic (struggling students):
- Likely to randomly guess or make fundamental errors
- Might mix up addition/subtraction signs
- A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%

basic (developing understanding):
- Common error: Forget to distribute negative signs
- C is an attractive "wrong" answer (positive instead of negative signs)
- A=25% B=25% C=35% D=15%

proficient (solid algebraic skills):
- Most will get correct method
- Some careless sign errors remain
- A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%

advanced (confident mathematicians):
- Almost all will solve correctly
- Minimal random errors
- A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%

My prediction:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=25% C=35% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
