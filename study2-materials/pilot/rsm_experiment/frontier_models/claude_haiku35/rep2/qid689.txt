Let me break this down systematically:

Correct solution: \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\) → \(p = \frac{1}{2}\) = 0.5

Error analysis:
- A (0.5): This is actually the CORRECT answer
- B (50): Students might divide 10 by 5 instead of cross-multiply
- C (2): Students might flip the fraction incorrectly
- D (No solutions): Students who don't understand fraction manipulation

Predicted response rates:

below_basic: A=10% B=50% C=30% D=10%
- High confusion
- Mechanical calculation errors
- Little understanding of equation solving

basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
- Some understanding emerging
- Still prone to calculation mistakes
- Starting to recognize correct approach

proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
- Solid algebraic manipulation
- Careful cross-checking
- Systematic solving

advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
