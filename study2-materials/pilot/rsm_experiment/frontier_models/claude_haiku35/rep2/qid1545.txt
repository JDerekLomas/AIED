Let me break this down step-by-step:

1) First, the correct calculation:
   8 + 12 ÷ 4 = 8 + 3 = 11
   (8 + 12) ÷ 4 = 20 ÷ 4 = 5

2) Common student misconceptions:
- Below basic: Will likely guess randomly or use incorrect order of operations
- Basic: Likely to struggle with order of operations, mixing up BIDMAS rules
- Proficient: Will understand order of operations but might make occasional calculation errors
- Advanced: Will solve this systematically

My prediction:

below_basic: A=30% B=35% C=20% D=15%
(High random guessing, most likely to confuse operations)

basic: A=25% B=40% C=25% D=10%
(More likely to choose B, representing a common calculation error of not respecting order of operations)

proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
(Most will understand correct approach, majority selecting the correct answer)

advanced: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
(Systematic approach, near-certain to get correct answer)

The key insight is that option B (less than) represents the classic mistake of not respecting order of operations.
