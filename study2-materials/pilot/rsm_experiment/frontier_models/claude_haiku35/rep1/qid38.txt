Let me break this down systematically:

Common Student Errors:
- The correct solution requires finding a common denominator (2x), then adding numerators
- Typical mistake paths:

1. Option A (11/2x): 
   - Correct method! Just add numerators after finding common denominator
   - Expected mostly from proficient students

2. Option B (7/3x):
   - Suggests students randomly adding/combining terms without proper denominator work
   - More likely from below basic/basic students

3. Option C (11/x):
   - Suggests students just adding numerators WITHOUT considering denominators
   - Classic "I'll just add the top numbers" error
   - Very attractive to lower-ability students

4. Option D (7/2x):
   - Suggests partial understanding - some denominator consideration
   - Might come from students who partially understand the process

Predicted Distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=25% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%

Reasoning reflects typical misconception patterns in algebraic fraction addition.
