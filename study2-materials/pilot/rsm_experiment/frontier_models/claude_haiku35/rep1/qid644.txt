Let me walk through my reasoning carefully:

When expanding (2p-1)(3p-4), these arrows point to (-1)(-4).

The correct calculation is: (-1)(-4) = +4

Thinking about student error patterns:

Below Basic (struggling students):
- Likely to struggle with sign rules
- Will probably randomly guess
- Might default to a negative answer
Predicted: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%

Basic (developing understanding):
- Common mistake: forget negative × negative rule
- Many will choose -4 (B) by incorrectly applying sign rules
Predicted: A=15% B=50% C=15% D=20%

Proficient (solid understanding):
- Know negative × negative = positive
- Minor calculation risks
Predicted: A=45% B=15% C=20% D=20%

Advanced (confident mathematicians):
- Will carefully track signs
- Almost certain to get +4
Predicted: A=70% B=5% C=10% D=15%

Therefore, my final prediction is:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=50% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=45% B=15% C=20% D=20%
advanced: A=70% B=5% C=10% D=15%
