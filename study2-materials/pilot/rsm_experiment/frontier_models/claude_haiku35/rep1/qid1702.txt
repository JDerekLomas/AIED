Let me break down my thought process:

1) To solve, students must rearrange 10x - 6y = 30 and substitute y = 0.5

2) Rearranging: 10x = 30 + 6y
               x = 3 + 0.6y

3) Substituting y = 0.5:
   x = 3 + 0.6(0.5)
     = 3 + 0.3
     = 3.3

Potential student errors:

Below Basic (low confidence):
- Random guessing
- Might not understand rearrangement
- Likely to choose options without clear reasoning

Basic (basic algebra skills):
- Might forget to rearrange
- Could subtract 6(0.5) from 30 incorrectly
- Might mix up signs

Proficient (solid understanding):
- More likely to make calculation errors
- Might rush and choose a nearby value

Advanced (confident, careful):
- Most likely to get correct answer
