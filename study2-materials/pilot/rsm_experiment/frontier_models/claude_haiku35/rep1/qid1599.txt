Let me break this down systematically:

Correct answer is A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)

below_basic (struggling students):
- Will likely make random guesses
- High chance of choosing visually similar options
A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%

basic (procedural understanding):
- Often struggle with division notation
- Option B looks "neat" by adding 4
- Might misunderstand how division actually works
A=30% B=35% C=20% D=15%

proficient (solid algebraic skills):
- Understand division means numerator/denominator
- Most will select correct answer
- Some lingering confusion might remain
A=65% B=15% C=10% D=10%

advanced (confident algebraic manipulators):
- Immediately recognize correct representation
- Will select A confidently
- Might explain why other options are incorrect
A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%

The key misconceptions:
- B suggests adding 4 to numerator (common error)
- C suggests division becomes addition
- D completely inverts the fraction

So my final prediction:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=35% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=65% B=15% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
