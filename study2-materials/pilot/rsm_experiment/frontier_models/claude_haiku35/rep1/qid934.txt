Let me walk through my reasoning carefully:

1) Solving the equation:
   When x = 0, then 4(0) + 2y = 10
   2y = 10
   y = 5 ✓

2) Typical student errors:

Below Basic (low confidence):
- May randomly guess
- Might not understand how to substitute values
- High chance of choosing A (20) or B (3)
Likely spread: A=35%, B=35%, C=20%, D=10%

Basic (procedural understanding):
- Some will substitute x=0 correctly
- Others might:
  * Divide 10 by 2 incorrectly (getting 5 right!)
  * Forget to check substitution
Likely spread: A=25%, B=20%, C=40%, D=15%

Proficient (solid algebraic skills):
- Most will solve systematically
- More likely to choose C (5)
Likely spread: A=10%, B=15%, C=65%, D=10%

Advanced (confident manipulation):
- Will solve methodically
- High chance of correct answer
Likely spread: A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%

Here's the prediction:

below_basic: A=35% B=35% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=65% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
