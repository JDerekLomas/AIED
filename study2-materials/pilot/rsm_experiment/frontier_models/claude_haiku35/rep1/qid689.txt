Let me analyze this systematically:

Solving \(10=\frac{5}{p}\):
• Rearranging gives \(p = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5\) (Correct answer is A)

Error analysis:
Below Basic:
• Will likely randomly guess or try simple manipulations
• Might flip numerator/denominator intuitively
• High chance of spreading responses fairly evenly

Basic:
• Common error: \(p = 5 \div 10 = 0.5\) (Correct)
• Some might think \(p = 10 \div 5 = 2\) (Option C)
• Some might get confused about reciprocals

Proficient:
• Most will solve correctly
• Slight confusion about fraction manipulation
• Careful about order of operations

Advanced:
• Guaranteed to solve correctly
• Might spot the "no solutions" trap and carefully verify

Predicted distribution:
