Let me break this down systematically:

Key error patterns:
- Students who forget BIDMAS/order of operations
- Students who calculate left-to-right
- Students who miss the negative signs

Likely distribution:

below_basic: 
- A=40% (left-to-right calculation: 3-5=(-2), (-2)+4×2=(-2)+8=6)
- B=20% (random guessing)
- C=25% (doing 3-(5+4×2) = 3-18 = -15)
- D=15% (random guessing)

basic: 
- A=35% (same left-to-right error)
- B=15% (simple miscalculation)
- C=30% (different order of operations error)
- D=20% (closer to correct thinking)

proficient:
- A=10% (occasional slip)
- B=25% (deliberate working)
- C=10% (rare calculation error)
- D=55% (correct BIDMAS: 4×2=8, then 3-5+8 = -10)

advanced:
- A=0% 
- B=5% (checking/double-checking)
- C=0%
- D=95% (systematic application of BIDMAS)
