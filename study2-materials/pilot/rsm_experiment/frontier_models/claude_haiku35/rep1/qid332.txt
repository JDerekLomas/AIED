Let me break this down carefully:

Solving \(\frac{x}{3}-5=12\) correctly:
• Add 5 to both sides: \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\)
• Multiply both sides by 3: \(x = 51\)

Tom's method is correct.
Katie's method (\(x-5=36\)) is incorrect.

Error analysis:
• Below basic students:
- Likely to guess randomly
- May not understand algebraic manipulation
- Higher chance of picking wrong options

• Basic students:
- Might try moving terms but get confused
- More likely to pick incorrect options
- May not systematically check working

• Proficient students:
- Should spot Tom's method is correct
- More methodical about checking steps
- More likely to choose "Only Tom"

• Advanced students:
- Will definitively solve and verify
- Guaranteed to choose correct answer
