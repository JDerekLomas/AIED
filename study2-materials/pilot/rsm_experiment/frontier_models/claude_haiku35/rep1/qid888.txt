Let me break this down carefully:

Correct method is: \( (m-5)(m-7) = m^{2} - 12m + 35 \)
This means option B is correct.

below_basic (40% of students):
- Common mistake spreading signs: 
A=25% (forgetting negative signs)
B=10% (random guess)
C=35% (positive signs everywhere)
D=30% (mixing signs)

basic (30% of students):
A=15% (basic sign error)
B=40% (some understanding emerging)
C=20% (still sign confusion)
D=25% (closer to correct method)

proficient (20% of students):
A=5% (rare mistakes now)
B=70% (most get it right)
C=10% (occasional sign slip)
D=15% (minor calculation errors)

advanced (10% of students):
A=0% (no basic errors)
B=90% (precise calculation)
C=5% (extreme carelessness)
D=5% (minor slip)

Key traps:
- Forgetting negative sign rules
- Thinking multiplication always makes things bigger
- Not carefully expanding step-by-step

Confident this reflects typical Year 9 performance.
