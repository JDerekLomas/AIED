Let me break this down systematically:

The correct answer is B) \( -\frac{4}{3} \)

below_basic (struggling students):
- Will likely guess randomly or make intuitive errors
- Might just copy signs without understanding
A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%

basic (procedural understanding):
- Common error: "just flip the first fraction" (C)
- Another common error: forget to track negative signs
A=15% B=35% C=35% D=15%

proficient (mostly correct method):
- Will understand you need to divide to isolate the star
- Some lingering sign confusion
A=5% B=75% C=10% D=10%

advanced (confident algebraic manipulation):
- Will solve methodically
- Unlikely to make sign errors
A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%

These predictions reflect common student thought processes: increasing precision and understanding as mathematical ability increases.

The key trap is "just flipping" or not carefully tracking negative signs when rearranging the equation.
