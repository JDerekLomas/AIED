Let me break this down methodically:

Correct solution: 
\( 2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5} = 3 \frac{3}{5} \)

below_basic:
• Will struggle with mixed number addition
• Likely to make procedural errors
A=35% B=25% C=30% D=10%

basic:
• Understand adding whole numbers
• Might struggle converting/adding fractions
A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%

proficient:
• Mostly understand procedure
• Occasional calculation slip
A=10% B=15% C=10% D=65%

advanced:
• Precise, methodical approach
• Understand all conversion steps
A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%

Key error analysis:
• Option B (\( \frac{18}{5} \)) suggests adding numerators/denominators incorrectly
• Option C (\( \frac{18}{10} \)) suggests reducing fractions without understanding
• Option D hints at misunderstanding mixed number conversion

The prediction reflects typical Year 9 misconception patterns around fraction addition.
