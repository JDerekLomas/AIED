Let me analyze this carefully from a teacher's perspective:

Problem P (\( 4-5+6= \)):
- This is order of operations: can do left-to-right
- Weak students will likely do left-to-right without hesitation
- More able students will recognize it doesn't matter here

Problem Q (\( 4+5 \times 6= \)):
- Classic BIDMAS trap
- Multiplication MUST be done before addition
- Weak students will do 4+5 first, getting wrong answer

My prediction:

below_basic: A=40% B=35% C=15% D=10%
- High percentage doing left-to-right
- Some random guessing
- A few accidentally correct

basic: A=25% B=50% C=15% D=10%
- More recognizing multiplication priority in Q
- Still some left-to-right errors in P

proficient: A=10% B=75% C=10% D=5%
- Strong understanding of order of operations
- Confident about multiplication first in Q

advanced: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- Completely secure in BIDMAS rules
- Minimal errors
