Let me analyze this carefully:

The correct solution is: 
1) \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \)
2) \( 60 = 1+k \) (multiply both sides by 4)
3) \( 59 = k \)

Error analysis:
- "Below basic" students will likely struggle with algebraic manipulation
- "Basic" level might make sign/arithmetic errors
- "Proficient" students more likely to do method correctly
- Trap of adding 1 instead of subtracting

Predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
- Many will guess or be confused
- Some will randomly choose or see part of working as correct

basic: A=25% B=15% C=15% D=45%
- More likely to recognize method is mostly wrong
- More careful about checking steps

proficient: A=10% B=5% C=70% D=15%
- Most will correctly solve and recognize both steps
- Detailed algebraic understanding

advanced: A=5% B=2% C=88% D=5%
- Precise algebraic manipulation
- Almost certain to solve correctly
