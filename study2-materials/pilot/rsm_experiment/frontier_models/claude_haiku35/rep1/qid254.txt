Let me break this down systematically:

Correct method is A: \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \)

Below Basic (struggling students):
- Likely to choose B (divide by 5 at end instead of dividing total)
- Might randomly guess
- Confusion about zero's role

Basic (developing students):
- High chance of B or C
- Often miss including zero
- Divide by wrong denominator

Proficient (solid understanding):
- More likely to choose A
- Will carefully check zero's inclusion
- Less likely to make computational errors

Advanced (confident mathematicians):
- Virtually certain to choose A
- Understand mean requires ALL numbers and total ÷ count

Predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=50% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=40% B=35% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%

These predictions reflect common student misconceptions about calculating mean, with increasing accuracy at higher ability levels.
