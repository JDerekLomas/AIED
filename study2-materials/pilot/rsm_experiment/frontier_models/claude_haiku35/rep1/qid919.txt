Let me walk through my reasoning:

The correct method is: \(y = 3x^{2}\)
So for \(x = 0.3\), \(y = 3(0.3)^{2} = 3(0.09) = 0.27\)

Likely error patterns:
- below_basic: Random guessing, total confusion
- basic: 
  * Might do \(3x\) instead of \(3x^{2}\)
  * Might multiply 0.3 × 3 
- proficient: Close to understanding, might make small calculation errors
- advanced: Will likely get this correct

Predicted distributions:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=5% D=0%

The key trap is option B (\(0.27\)), which is the correct calculation but might feel "too small" to some students, leading them to choose other options.
