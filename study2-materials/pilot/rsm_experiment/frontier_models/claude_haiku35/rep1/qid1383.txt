Let me break this down carefully:

Correct solution: \( (-3)^{4} = 81 \)

Thinking through potential student errors:

Below Basic:
- Will likely struggle with negative number powers
- Might just pick randomly or guess
- Likely high spread across options
- Probably won't consistently apply rules

Basic:
- Common error: Forgetting sign rules
- Might think \( (-3)^{4} = -81 \) because they recall "negative to even power is positive"
- Some will panic and choose randomly
- Some will recognize 81 looks "neat"

Proficient:
- Should mostly get it right
- Small chance of momentary slip
- Might make sign calculation error

Advanced:
- Will solve methodically
- Near 100% correct

Predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=2% D=2%

The key is showing increasing accuracy and decreasing random/error selection as student ability increases.
