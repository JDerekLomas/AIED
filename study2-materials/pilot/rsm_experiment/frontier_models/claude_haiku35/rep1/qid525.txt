Let me break down the solution and think through student reasoning:

Correct solution: 
1) Convert mixed numbers to improper fractions
   \( 2 \frac{7}{10} = \frac{27}{10} \)
   \( 2 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \)
2) Find common denominator (20)
   \( \frac{27}{10} = \frac{54}{20} \)
   \( \frac{9}{4} = \frac{45}{20} \)
3) Add fractions
   \( \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20} \)

Predicted errors:
- Option A (right answer): Students who did the calculation correctly
- Option B (also correct): Some might misread their work
- Option C: Incorrectly divided 99 by 40
- Option D: Didn't reduce/simplify fractions correctly
