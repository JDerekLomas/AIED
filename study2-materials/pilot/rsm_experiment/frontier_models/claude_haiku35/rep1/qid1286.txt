Let me break this down systematically:

Correct formula for sphere volume is V = (4/3)πr³

Errors I'd expect:

Below Basic (low confidence):
- Likely to guess randomly
- Might swap π around without understanding
- Probable rearrangement mistakes
Prediction:
A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%

Basic (procedural understanding):
- Will likely swap π/numbers around
- Common error: "forgetting" the 4/3 coefficient
- Some algebra confusion
Prediction:
A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%

Proficient (solid algebraic skills):
- Most will work it out correctly
- Might make small sign/coefficient errors
- More systematic working
Prediction:
A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%

Advanced (confident mathematical reasoning):
- Will methodically rearrange
- Full understanding of volume formula
- Precise algebraic manipulation
Prediction:
A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%

Therefore my final prediction:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
