Let me break this down systematically:

Calculation:
• 8+12 ÷ 4 = 8+3 = 11
• (8+12) ÷ 4 = 20 ÷ 4 = 5

So the correct answer is B: < (11 > 5)

Predicted error patterns:

below_basic (low confidence, weak order of operations):
• Many will do operations left-to-right
• High chance of choosing C (=) incorrectly
A=10% B=20% C=50% D=20%

basic (know some BODMAS, but shaky):
• Some understand brackets, some don't
• More likely to recognize the difference
A=5% B=40% C=35% D=20%

proficient (solid understanding):
• Clear understanding of correct method
• Careful calculation
A=2% B=85% C=8% D=5%

advanced (confident, precise):
• Quick, accurate calculation
• Methodical approach
A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%

Confident this reflects typical UK Year 9 performance.
