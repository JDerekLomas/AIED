Let me break this down systematically:

Correct solution: \( p = \frac{1}{36} \) (dividing both sides by 3)

Below Basic (typically struggling with basic algebra):
- Likely to guess randomly or use incorrect methods
- Attracted to whole numbers or simple fractions
A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%

Basic (understand basic algebra, but prone to common errors):
- Many will divide the fraction by 3 incorrectly
- Some will just halve 1/12
A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%

Proficient (solid algebraic skills):
- Most will solve correctly
- Small chance of minor computational errors
A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%

Advanced (highly confident, check work):
- Almost all will solve correctly
- Might quickly spot and eliminate incorrect options
A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%

The key errors:
- A (1/4): Incorrectly "halving" the denominator
- C (4): Mistaking multiplication for division
- D (1/9): Another denominator manipulation error
