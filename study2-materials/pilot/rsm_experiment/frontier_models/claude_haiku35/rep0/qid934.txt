Let me break this down methodically:

Analysis:
- Equation is 4x + 2y = 10
- At x = 0, we need to solve for y
- Correct method: 4(0) + 2y = 10, so 2y = 10, y = 5

Predicted error patterns:
Below Basic:
- Will randomly guess
- Might halve 10 instead of dividing by 2
- Might not understand equation manipulation

Basic:
- Likely to divide 10 by 4 instead of 2
- Might struggle with algebraic rearrangement
- Some will guess 3 (looks "simple")

Proficient:
- More likely to get close/understand method
- Might make small calculation errors
- Less random guessing

Advanced:
- Should solve correctly
- Might check work
- Very low chance of significant error

Predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=35% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=65% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
