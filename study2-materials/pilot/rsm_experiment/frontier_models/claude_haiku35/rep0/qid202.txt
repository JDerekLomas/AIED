Let me break this down methodically:

Correct solution: 
\( 2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5} = 3 \frac{3}{5} \)

Predicted common errors:
• Option B (\( \frac{18}{5} \)): Likely from students who correctly convert to improper fractions but forget to convert back
• Option C (\( \frac{18}{10} \)): Suggests denominator confusion/incorrect reduction
• Option D (\( 3 \frac{3}{10} \)): Looks like a "near miss" calculation error

Below_basic (lower-ability students):
A=5% B=40% C=35% D=20%
- High chance of denominator/conversion errors
- Likely to make computational mistakes

Basic:
A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%
- More systematic but still prone to errors
- Starting to understand mixed number conversions

Proficient:
A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
- Most will get correct answer
- Small percentage still make procedural mistakes

Advanced:
A=85% B=3% C=2% D=10%
- Consistent, precise calculation
- Minimal computational errors
