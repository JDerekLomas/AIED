Let me break this down thoughtfully:

Problem P (4-5+6):
- Correct order is (4-5)+6 or 4+(-5+6)
- Below basic students will do left-to-right: 4-5=−1, then −1+6=5
- Basic students might struggle with negative numbers

Problem Q (4+5×6):
- Correct order is 5×6 first, then 4+30
- Very common error is left-to-right: 4+5=9, then 9×6=54
- This matches a natural "read from left" instinct

Predicted responses:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=45% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%

Key reasoning:
- Lower ability students more likely to do left-to-right
- Proficient/advanced students understand order of operations
- Problem Q's incorrect left-to-right method is especially "attractive"
