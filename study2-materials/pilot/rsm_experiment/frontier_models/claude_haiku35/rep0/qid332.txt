Let me break this down carefully:

Tom's method (\( \frac{x}{3}=17 \)):
✓ Correct. He adds 5 to both sides of the original equation.
Calculation: \( \frac{x}{3} = 12 + 5 = 17 \)
Final solve: \( x = 17 * 3 = 51 \)

Katie's method (\( x-5=36 \)):
✗ Incorrect. She's multiplied both sides by 3, but incorrectly.

Common student errors:
- Below basic: Random guessing, mixing up operations
- Basic: Struggle with rearranging equations
- Proficient: More likely to check work
- Advanced: Will spot the precise error immediately

My predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=5% D=70%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%

The key is how students handle algebraic manipulation, which varies dramatically by ability level.

Would you like me to explain the reasoning behind these predictions?
