Let me analyze this systematically:

Volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr³

To find radius, students must algebraically rearrange: r = ∛[(3V)/(4π)]

Below_basic (weaker students):
- Will randomly guess
- Likely confused by volume/radius relationship
A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%

Basic (procedural understanding):
- Most likely to make sign/fraction manipulation errors
- Will struggle with cube root rearrangement
A=35% B=30% C=20% D=15%

Proficient (solid algebraic skills):
- Will carefully trace algebraic steps
- More likely to choose correct answer
A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%

Advanced (confident mathematicians):
- Will derive solution methodically
- Understand volume-radius relationship
A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%

So my prediction:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=30% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
