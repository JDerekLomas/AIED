Let me analyze this systematically:

Correct Answer is A) 81

Analysis:
- T = k^4 means (-3)^4
- (-3)^4 = 81 (even power, so positive)
- Key misconceptions will depend on student understanding of negative number powers

Below Basic (lower ability students):
- Will likely struggle with signs
- Might randomly guess or get confused
- Expect spread: A=25%, B=25%, C=25%, D=25%

Basic (struggling students):
- May incorrectly think negative sign matters
- Likely choose C) -81 (thinking negative base gives negative result)
- Possible confusion with odd vs even powers
- A=20%, B=10%, C=45%, D=25%

Proficient (middle ability):
- Understand even powers are positive
- Most will calculate correctly
- Some residual sign confusion
- A=60%, B=15%, C=15%, D=10%

Advanced (top students):
- Will calculate systematically
- Fully understand power rules
- A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%

Response:
below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=45% D=25%
proficient: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
