Let me break this down methodically:

Correct Answer: A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)

Below Basic (struggling students):
- Will likely make random guesses or simple mistakes
- Might struggle with division representation
- Likely to choose options that look "simple"
Predicted: A=15% B=35% C=25% D=25%

Basic (limited algebraic understanding):
- Common error: B) \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \) looks tempting 
- Shows students adding 4 without understanding division notation
- Suggests they're not confident with algebraic division
Predicted: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%

Proficient (solid algebraic skills):
- Understand division notation
- More systematic in checking answers
- Less likely to make careless mistakes
Predicted: A=65% B=15% C=10% D=10%

Advanced (strong mathematicians):
- Will immediately recognize correct representation
- Methodical in checking algebraic conventions
Predicted: A=90% B=3% C=2% D=5%
