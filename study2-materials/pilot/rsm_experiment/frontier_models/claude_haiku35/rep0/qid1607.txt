Let me walk through my reasoning:

1) Correct solution path:
   \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \)
   \( 60 = 1+k \)  ✓ (Multiply both sides by 4)
   \( k = 59 \)   ✓ (Subtract 1 from both sides)

2) Error analysis:
- Below basic students likely guess randomly
- Basic students often struggle with algebra manipulation
- Proficient students are more likely to spot errors
- Advanced students should solve this perfectly

3) Common errors:
- Multiplying by 4 incorrectly: Shows some algebraic understanding
- Not checking final steps
- Jumping to conclusions without careful verification

Prediction:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=20% B=10% C=50% D=20%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%

Reasoning:
- A attractive because first step looks partially correct
- Advanced students most likely to solve completely correctly
- Basic students most likely to make partial/random errors
- Proficient students have best chance of full correct solution
