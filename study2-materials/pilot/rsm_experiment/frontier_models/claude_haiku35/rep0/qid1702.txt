Let me analyze this systematically:

The correct method is:
1) Substitute y = 0.5 into the original equation
2) 10x - 6(0.5) = 30
3) 10x - 3 = 30
4) 10x = 33
5) x = 3.3

Common student errors:

Below Basic (low confidence):
- Likely to guess randomly
- Might struggle to manipulate the equation
- Might just pick a number that "looks right"

Basic (mechanical understanding):
- Likely to make sign errors
- Might subtract 6y incorrectly
- Could accidentally divide instead of multiply

Proficient (understands method):
- Most likely to solve correctly
- Small chance of arithmetic slip

Advanced (confident manipulation):
- Almost certainly solve correctly
- Minimal chance of error
