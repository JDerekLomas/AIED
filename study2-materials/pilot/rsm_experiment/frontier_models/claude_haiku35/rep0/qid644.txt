Let me analyze this step-by-step:

The correct calculation is (-1)(-4) = +4

Error Analysis:
- Multiplying signed numbers is a common struggle
- Students often forget the "negative × negative = positive" rule
- Lower ability students might randomly guess or just pick a sign

Specific error predictions:
- Below basic: High chance of random guessing
- Basic: Likely to make sign errors
- Proficient: Should mostly get this right
- Advanced: Definitely should get this right

Predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%

Reasoning:
- Below basic: Even spread due to random guessing
- Basic: More likely to choose -4 (B) due to sign confusion
- Proficient: Majority should get +4 (D)
- Advanced: Almost all should get +4 (D)

These percentages reflect typical student performance in UK Year 9 maths, showing increasing accuracy with ability level.
