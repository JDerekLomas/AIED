Let me break this down step-by-step:

1) Correct calculation:
   8+12 ÷ 4 = 8+3 = 11
   (8+12) ÷ 4 = 20 ÷ 4 = 5

2) Errors likely at different levels:

Below Basic (struggling students):
- Often just guess
- Might not understand order of operations
- Likely to pick option A or B randomly
Predicted: A=35% B=35% C=20% D=10%

Basic:
- Common error: forgetting order of operations
- Likely to choose A (11 > 5)
Predicted: A=45% B=10% C=30% D=15%

Proficient:
- Most understand order of operations
- Some might still make careless mistakes
Predicted: A=15% B=5% C=70% D=10%

Advanced:
- Always apply correct order of operations
- Careful calculation
Predicted: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%
