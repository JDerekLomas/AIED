Let me break this down systematically:

A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \)
- Omits zero, which is a common mistake
- Calculation looks close to correct
- Attractive to students who "forget" the zero exists

B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \)
- Fundamentally misunderstands order of operations
- Divides last number by 5, not the total
- Very "natural" mistake for struggling students

C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \)
- Omits zero AND uses wrong denominator
- Double error makes it look deliberate
- Suggests lack of understanding of mean concept

Analysis:
- Below basic: Will mostly choose B, some A
- Basic: Split between B and A
- Proficient: Will choose D or calculate \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \)
- Advanced: Definitely D

below_basic: A=25% B=60% C=10% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=40% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
