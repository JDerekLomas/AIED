Let me break down the likely student thinking:

Correct method is FOIL/distributive method:
(m-5)(m-7) = m(m) + m(-7) + (-5)(m) + (-5)(-7)
           = m² - 7m - 5m + 35
           = m² - 12m + 35  (Option B)

Predicted errors:
• Below basic: Random guessing/no real method
• Basic: Likely to make sign errors or forget last term multiplication
• Proficient: Mostly get it right, occasional slip
• Advanced: Perfect or self-correcting

Here's my prediction:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

Key error patterns:
- A: Adding instead of subtracting
- C: Accidentally making middle term positive
- D: Incorrect sign on last term
- B: Correct method

The progression shows increasing methodical calculation and error-catching.
