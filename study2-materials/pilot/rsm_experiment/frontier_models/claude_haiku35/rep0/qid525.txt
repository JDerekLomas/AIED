Let me break this down methodically:

Correct solution: Convert to improper fractions, add, then convert back
\( 2\frac{7}{10} = \frac{27}{10} \)
\( 2\frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \)
\( \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{108}{40} + \frac{90}{40} = \frac{198}{40} = 4\frac{19}{20} \)

Common errors:
- Adding numerators/denominators separately (A)
- Not converting to common denominator (C)
- Incorrectly simplifying mixed number (D)

below_basic: A=35% B=10% C=40% D=15%
- Many will add numerators/denominators naively
- Few will get correct answer
- High chance of random/guessed answers

basic: A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%
- More systematic but still error-prone
- Starting to understand conversion steps
- More deliberate wrong choices

proficient: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
- Most will recognize correct method
- Occasional calculation slip-ups
- Mostly converging on right answer

advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
- Precise method execution
- Very high correct answer rate
- Minimal errors
