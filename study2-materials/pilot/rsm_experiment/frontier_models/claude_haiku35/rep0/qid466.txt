Let me break this down systematically:

Solution: \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \)
Correct solution is \( \frac{4}{3} \)

Below Basic (struggling students):
- High chance of random guessing
- Likely to get confused by negative signs
- Might choose based on visual similarity
A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%

Basic (procedural understanding):
- Will likely try to "cancel" or "flip" signs
- Common error: choosing -\frac{4}{3} thinking "negative times negative"
A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%

Proficient (solid understanding):
- Most will solve correctly
- Some residual sign confusion might occur
A=15% B=15% C=10% D=60%

Advanced (confident manipulators):
- Will solve systematically
- Understand negative multiplication
A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
proficient: A=15% B=15% C=10% D=60%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
