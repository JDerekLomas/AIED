Let me break this down systematically:

1. Correct solution method:
   - Divide both sides by 3: p = (1/12) ÷ 3 = 1/36

2. Likely student errors:

Below Basic (struggling students):
- Likely to choose randomly or make major conceptual errors
- Might just pick a number that "looks right"
- Possibly misunderstand division by 3

Basic (foundation level):
- Common error of just dividing by 3 incorrectly: p = 1/4 (most likely error)
- Might guess 4 as an "obvious" answer
- Limited understanding of fraction manipulation

Proficient (intermediate):
- More likely to attempt correct method
- Some lingering method confusion
- Might make small calculation errors

Advanced (high ability):
- Should solve correctly
- Low chance of systematic error
- Might check work carefully

Predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
