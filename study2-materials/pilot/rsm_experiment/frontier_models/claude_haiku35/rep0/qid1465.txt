Let me break this down step-by-step:

1) Correct solution is D) -10
   (3 - 5 + 4 × 2 = 3 - 5 + 8 = 6 - 5 = 1)

2) Common errors:
- Below basic: Will likely calculate left-to-right, ignoring order of operations
- Basic: May forget/not understand order of operations
- Proficient: Might make small calculation errors
- Advanced: Likely to solve correctly

Predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
(Left-to-right calculation: 3 - 5 = -2, then -2 × 2 = -4)

basic: A=20% B=25% C=35% D=20%
(Partial understanding of BODMAS, more systematic errors)

proficient: A=10% B=15% C=10% D=65%
(Most will understand order of operations, some small calculation errors)

advanced: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
(Almost all will solve correctly)

This reflects typical Year 9 performance with order of operations.
