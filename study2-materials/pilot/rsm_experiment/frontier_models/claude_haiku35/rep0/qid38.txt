Let me break this down systematically:

Common Error Analysis:
- Correct answer is C) 11/x
- Wrong method attempts will dominate mistakes

Below Basic (struggling students):
- Likely to just add numerators: 3/2x + 4/x = 7/3x (Option B)
- Very random guessing across options
Below Basic: A=15% B=35% C=25% D=25%

Basic (procedural understanding):
- Will try to find common denominator
- Many will struggle with 2x and x
- Some will do 3/2x + 4/x incorrectly
Basic: A=20% B=25% C=40% D=15%

Proficient (sound algebraic skills):
- Most will recognize need for common denominator
- Some slight calculation errors
- Better understanding of process
Proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%

Advanced (confident mathematicians):
- Will solve methodically
- Most likely to get correct answer
- May even spot direct solution method
Advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%

The key errors are common denominator mistakes and basic numerator/denominator confusion.
