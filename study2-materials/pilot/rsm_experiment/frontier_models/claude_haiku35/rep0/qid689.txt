Let me walk through my reasoning:

Below Basic (struggling students):
- Many will randomly guess
- Some will see 10/5 and get confused
- Likely to spread answers fairly evenly
- Slightly more likely to choose A or B as they look "simple"
below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%

Basic (developing understanding):
- Common error: Trying to "cancel" 10 and 5
- Might flip the fraction and get 0.5
- Some will see B (50) as a "safe" looking answer
basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%

Proficient (solid understanding):
- Will recognize \(p = 5/10 = 0.5\)
- Some might momentarily doubt their work
- More systematic checking
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=10% D=15%

Advanced (high performers):
- Quick algebraic manipulation
- Will confidently solve and verify
- Precise understanding of fraction operations
advanced: A=90% B=1% C=1% D=8%

My prediction takes into account typical student misconceptions and calculation patterns.
