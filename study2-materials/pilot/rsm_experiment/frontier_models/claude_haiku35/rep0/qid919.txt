Let me break this down methodically:

Correct method: \( y = 3x^2 \)
So for \( x = 0.3 \): \( y = 3(0.3)^2 = 3(0.09) = 0.27 \)

Likely student errors:

Below Basic (weaker students):
- Might multiply 0.3 by 3 (gives 0.9)
- Might square 3 first instead of x
- Random guessing

Basic students:
- Often struggle with decimal squares
- Might get partway correct but make a calculation error
- Attracted to options that "look right"

Proficient students:
- More likely to systematically work through
- Small chance of minor calculation slip

Advanced students:
- Should solve precisely

Predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=15% B=50% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=5% D=0%

Key observations:
- Option B (0.27) is the correct answer
- Increases in accuracy with student ability
- Decimal calculations are tricky for younger students
