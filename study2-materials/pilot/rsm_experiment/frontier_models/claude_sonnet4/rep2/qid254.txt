Let me analyze each option and the likely student errors:

**Option A: (1+3+4+7)/5** - This omits the 0 from the numerator but keeps 5 in denominator. Students might think "0 doesn't count" or overlook it.

**Option B: 0+1+3+4+7÷5** - This has incorrect order of operations. Without brackets, it calculates 0+1+3+4+(7÷5) = 9.4 instead of (0+1+3+4+7)÷5 = 3. This is a very attractive error as students often write means this way colloquially.

**Option C: (1+3+4+7)/4** - This omits 0 from both numerator and denominator. Students think "0 doesn't count so we have 4 numbers."

**Option D: None of them** - This is correct since the right answer should be (0+1+3+4+7)/5.

**Error analysis:**
- Omitting 0 is very common - students often think "zero doesn't matter"
- Order of operations errors are frequent, especially when no brackets are shown
- Advanced students will spot these errors and choose D
- Weaker students will be drawn to the "natural looking" options
