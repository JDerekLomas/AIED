Let me analyze what students would likely do when evaluating Isaac's steps.

**Isaac's work analysis:**
- Step 1: $15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \rightarrow 60 = 1+k$ (multiplying both sides by 4) ✓ CORRECT
- Step 2: $60 = 1+k \rightarrow 61 = k$ (this should be $k = 59$) ✗ INCORRECT

**Common student thinking patterns:**

**Below Basic students** often:
- Don't check work systematically
- Get confused about which step has the error
- May think both steps look wrong because the final answer "feels" wrong
- Struggle to follow multi-step algebra

**Basic students** typically:
- Can follow the multiplication by 4 in step 1
- Many will catch the arithmetic error in step 2 (60 - 1 = 59, not 61)
- Some will second-guess themselves about step 1 being correct
- A significant portion will correctly identify only step 1 as correct

**Proficient students** usually:
- Systematically check each step
- Confidently verify step 1 by multiplying both sides by 4
- Catch the arithmetic error in step 2
- Most will correctly choose A

**Advanced students** almost always:
- Quickly verify step 1 is correct
- Immediately spot that $60 - 1 = 59$, not 61
- May double-check by substituting back into original equation
- Nearly all will choose A
