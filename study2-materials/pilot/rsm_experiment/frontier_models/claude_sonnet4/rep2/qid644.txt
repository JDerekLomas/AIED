Let me think through the common errors students make when multiplying terms in bracket expansion.

The correct calculation is (-1) × (-4) = +4, so A is correct.

**Analysis of likely errors:**

**Option B (-4):** This comes from forgetting that "negative × negative = positive" - a very common error. Students see -1 and -4 and think the answer stays negative, or they correctly identify it should be positive but then second-guess themselves.

**Option C (+5):** This is an addition error - students add |-1| + |-4| = 5 instead of multiplying. This feels "natural" to weaker students who confuse the operations.

**Option D (-5):** This combines two errors - adding instead of multiplying AND getting the wrong sign (thinking negative + negative = negative result).

**Ability level analysis:**

- **Advanced students:** Will reliably get this right, though a small percentage might have a momentary lapse
- **Proficient students:** Most will get it right, but some will fall into the "negative × negative = negative" trap
- **Basic students:** Will be split between the correct answer and sign errors, with some addition confusion
- **Below basic students:** Will show the most confusion between operations and struggle with negative number rules
