Let me think through this step by step, considering what students at each level would do.

The equation is: x/3 - 5 = 12

Tom's approach: Add 5 to both sides → x/3 = 17 ✓ (CORRECT)
Katie's approach: Multiply both sides by 3 → x - 15 = 36 ✗ (INCORRECT - she forgot to multiply the -5 by 3)

**Analysis of student thinking:**

**Below Basic students:** Often don't understand order of operations or how to manipulate equations systematically. They might recognize Tom's step as "obvious" (just add 5), but Katie's looks more complex. Many will guess or pick what seems simplest.

**Basic students:** Can do simple equation solving but struggle with multi-step problems involving fractions. Tom's method follows the standard "undo operations in reverse order" that they've been taught. Katie's approach (multiply first) is less common in their experience and the error is subtle - they might not catch that -5 should become -15.

**Proficient students:** Understand multiple approaches to solving equations. They can see Tom is correct and should spot that Katie made a distribution error. However, some might get confused by seeing two different approaches and second-guess themselves.

**Advanced students:** Clearly see both approaches and can identify Katie's error immediately. They understand that while you could multiply through by 3 first, Katie failed to apply it to all terms.

The key trap: Katie's error (x - 5 = 36 instead of x - 15 = 36) is very attractive because students often forget to distribute multiplication across all terms.
