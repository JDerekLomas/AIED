Let me think through the common errors and how students at different levels would approach this.

The correct answer is A) 6, following order of operations: 3 - 5 + 4 × 2 = 3 - 5 + 8 = 6

**Common errors:**
- **Left to right without BIDMAS**: 3 - 5 + 4 × 2 = -2 + 4 × 2 = 2 × 2 = 4 (Option B)
- **Grouping operations incorrectly**: (3 - 5 + 4) × 2 = 2 × 2 = 4 (Also Option B)
- **Left to right completely**: 3 - 5 + 4 × 2 = -2 + 4 × 2 = -2 × 2 = -4 (not an option, so they might pick D)
- **Other grouping**: 3 - (5 + 4) × 2 = 3 - 9 × 2 = 3 - 18 = -15 (close to D)

**Error analysis:**
- Option B (4) is very attractive - it comes from the most natural error of working left to right
- Option D (-10) might catch students who make sign errors or group incorrectly
- Option C (-12) is less likely but could come from calculation errors

**Ability level thinking:**
- **Below basic**: Often ignore BIDMAS entirely, work left to right
- **Basic**: Know about BIDMAS but apply inconsistently, especially with negative numbers
- **Proficient**: Usually apply BIDMAS correctly but might make arithmetic errors
- **Advanced**: Should get this right consistently

below_basic: A=15% B=60% C=5% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
