Let me think through the common errors students make with this type of equation.

The correct answer is A) $\frac{4}{3}$ because $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1$.

**Key errors I'd expect to see:**

1. **Sign confusion**: Many students struggle with "negative times positive equals negative" and might think they need a negative answer, leading to B) $-\frac{4}{3}$.

2. **Reciprocal without sign consideration**: Students often correctly identify they need the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$ (which is $\frac{4}{3}$) but get confused about the sign, sometimes thinking the reciprocal should be negative.

3. **"Canceling" approach**: Some students think they just need to "cancel out" the fraction and choose C) $\frac{3}{4}$ or D) $-\frac{3}{4}$.

4. **Division confusion**: Some students incorrectly think $-1 \div (-\frac{3}{4}) = -\frac{4}{3}$.

**Ability level analysis:**

- **Below basic**: Likely to guess or use flawed reasoning about signs and reciprocals
- **Basic**: May find reciprocal but struggle with sign rules
- **Proficient**: Should get this right but some may second-guess the signs
- **Advanced**: Should confidently get A
