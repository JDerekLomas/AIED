Let me think through what errors students typically make with this type of algebraic notation question.

**Analysis of each option:**
- A) $\frac{c}{h+4}$ - This is correct
- B) $\frac{c+4}{h+4}$ - Student thinks the 4 applies to both numerator and denominator
- C) $\frac{c}{h}+4$ - Student incorrectly distributes the division over addition
- D) $\frac{h+4}{c}$ - Student reverses numerator and denominator

**Common errors I'd expect:**
- **Option B**: Very attractive error - students often think "divide by (h+4)" means both parts get the operation
- **Option C**: Classic misunderstanding of order of operations with fractions - treating $c \div (h+4)$ as $(c \div h) + 4$
- **Option D**: Less common but some students confuse which goes on top vs bottom

**By ability level:**

**Below basic students**: Often struggle with fraction notation and order of operations. Options B and C are very tempting.

**Basic students**: May recognize fraction format but still make systematic errors with brackets and operations.

**Proficient students**: Generally understand algebraic conventions but might second-guess themselves.

**Advanced students**: Should reliably get this correct.

below_basic: A=25% B=35% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=8% C=5% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
