Let me think through the common errors students make with this type of algebraic fraction addition.

The correct method is to find a common denominator (2x), then:
$$\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$$

So A) is correct.

**Error Analysis:**

**Option B) $\frac{7}{3x}$**: This comes from adding numerators (3+4=7) and denominators (2x+x=3x). This is the classic "add tops, add bottoms" error that's very attractive to weaker students.

**Option C) $\frac{11}{x}$**: This happens when students correctly add numerators to get 11, but incorrectly think the common denominator is just x (possibly ignoring the 2, or thinking 2x simplified to x).

**Option D) $\frac{7}{2x}$**: This occurs when students add numerators incorrectly (3+4=7) but correctly identify 2x as the common denominator.

**Attractiveness of errors:**
- Option B is very attractive to below_basic students (natural but wrong approach)
- Option C might catch basic students who get partway through correctly
- Option D combines one right step with one wrong step

**Self-correction likelihood:**
- Advanced students will double-check their work
- Proficient students usually know the method but might make arithmetic errors
- Basic students might recognize they need common denominators but execute poorly
- Below_basic students often just add numerators and denominators

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
