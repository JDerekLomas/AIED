Let me think through the common errors and approaches for this equation.

The correct method is to multiply both sides by p, then divide by 10:
10 = 5/p
10p = 5
p = 5/10 = 0.5

So A) p = 0.5 is correct.

Common errors I'd expect to see:

**Error leading to B) p = 50:**
Students might incorrectly think "to get rid of the fraction, multiply 10 × 5" getting p = 50. This is a very attractive error because students often struggle with fraction operations and might think they need to "clear" the fraction by multiplying the numbers they see.

**Error leading to C) p = 2:**
Students might flip the equation incorrectly, thinking p/5 = 10, so p = 50... wait, that's not right. More likely, they might think 5/p = 10 means p = 10/5 = 2. This comes from incorrectly rearranging the fraction.

**Error leading to D):**
Very few students would choose this - the equation clearly has a solution.

**Ability level analysis:**

- **Below basic:** Will struggle with fraction manipulation, likely to make the "multiply everything" error or get confused
- **Basic:** Might make algebraic errors but understand there is a solution
- **Proficient:** Should get this right or make minor computational errors
- **Advanced:** Should definitely get this correct
