Let me think through this step by step.

The correct answer is C) 5, since when x = 0: 4(0) + 2y = 10, so 2y = 10, therefore y = 5.

Now let me consider the likely errors:

**Option A (20)**: This comes from the very common error of confusing which variable to solve for, or misunderstanding the equation structure. Students might think y = 10 × 2 = 20, or substitute incorrectly.

**Option B (3)**: This likely comes from arithmetic errors like 10 ÷ 2 = 3 (instead of 5), or from getting confused with the coefficients.

**Option C (5)**: The correct answer - requires substituting x = 0, getting 2y = 10, then y = 5.

**Option D (2.5)**: This comes from the error 10 ÷ 4 = 2.5, where students divide by the wrong coefficient or get confused about which number to divide by.

Considering ability levels:

- Below basic: Often struggle with substitution and basic algebra, likely to make fundamental errors
- Basic: Can substitute but make arithmetic or procedural errors
- Proficient: Generally get these right but some still make careless mistakes
- Advanced: Should get this correct almost always
