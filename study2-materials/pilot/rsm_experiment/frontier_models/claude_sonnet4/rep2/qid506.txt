Let me think through the common errors students make with this type of equation.

The correct answer is B) p = 1/36 (dividing both sides by 3: p = 1/12 ÷ 3 = 1/12 × 1/3 = 1/36)

**Common errors I'd expect:**

**Option A (p = 1/4):** Students who think 3p = 1/12 means "3 times something equals 1/12" and incorrectly reason that 1/12 × 3 = 1/4. This is multiplying instead of dividing.

**Option C (p = 4):** Students who flip the fraction incorrectly, thinking 1/12 ÷ 3 = 12 ÷ 3 = 4. This shows poor fraction understanding.

**Option D (p = 1/9):** Students who subtract: 1/12 - 3 = 1/9 (converting 3 to 3/12 = 1/4, but making arithmetic errors) or other confused fraction operations.

**By ability level:**

- **Below basic:** Strong attraction to wrong methods, especially the "multiply instead of divide" error and fraction misconceptions
- **Basic:** Some get it right, but many fall for the attractive wrong answers
- **Proficient:** Most get it correct, few fall for obvious traps
- **Advanced:** Nearly all correct
