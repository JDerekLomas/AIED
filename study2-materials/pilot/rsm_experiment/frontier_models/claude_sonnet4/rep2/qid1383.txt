Let me think through the common errors students make with this type of question.

The correct calculation is: T = (-3)⁴ = (-3) × (-3) × (-3) × (-3) = 81, so A is correct.

Common errors I'd expect to see:

**Option B (12):** This likely comes from students who think k⁴ means 4k, so they calculate 4 × (-3) = -12, but then maybe take the absolute value or make another sign error to get 12. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of notation.

**Option C (-81):** This is the most attractive wrong answer. Students correctly calculate 3⁴ = 81 but incorrectly think that (-3)⁴ = -81. They're applying the negative sign after doing the power calculation, not understanding that even powers of negative numbers are positive.

**Option D (-12):** Similar to option B, this comes from thinking k⁴ means 4k, giving 4 × (-3) = -12.

**Ability level analysis:**

- **Below basic:** Often don't understand powers notation, confuse with multiplication
- **Basic:** Can do powers but struggle with negative number rules
- **Proficient:** Usually get negative number rules right, though some may slip up
- **Advanced:** Should get this correct consistently

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=5% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=10% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%
