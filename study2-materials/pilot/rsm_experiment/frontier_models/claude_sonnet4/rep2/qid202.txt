Let me think through the common errors for this mixed number addition problem.

The correct answer is A) $3\frac{3}{5}$ (adding whole numbers: 2+1=3, adding fractions: $\frac{1}{5}+\frac{2}{5}=\frac{3}{5}$).

**Error analysis:**

**Option B) $\frac{18}{5}$**: This comes from converting to improper fractions correctly ($\frac{11}{5}+\frac{7}{5}=\frac{18}{5}$) but not converting back to mixed number as requested. This is actually correct mathematically, just wrong format.

**Option C) $\frac{18}{10}$**: This suggests students added numerators correctly (1+2=3) but then incorrectly thought the denominator should be 5+5=10, then somehow got to 18/10. More likely, they converted mixed numbers incorrectly or made multiple computational errors.

**Option D) $3\frac{3}{10}$**: This comes from correctly adding whole numbers (2+1=3) and numerators (1+2=3), but incorrectly adding denominators (5+5=10). This is a very attractive error - students often think "add everything."

**Ability level predictions:**

- **Advanced students**: Will get A, though some might choose B knowing it's equivalent
- **Proficient students**: Mostly A, but some will fall for the "add denominators" trap (D)
- **Basic students**: Split between correct method (A) and adding denominators (D)
- **Below basic students**: Most will add denominators (D), with various other computational errors

below_basic: A=25% B=10% C=15% D=50%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=80% B=18% C=1% D=1%
