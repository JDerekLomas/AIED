Let me think through the common errors and what attracts students at different levels.

The correct answer is B) 4 19/20.

**Error analysis:**
- Option A (99/20): This is the correct answer but as an improper fraction, not converted to mixed number
- Option B (4 19/20): Correct answer in mixed number form
- Option C (99/40): Wrong denominator - likely multiplied denominators (10 × 4 = 40) instead of finding LCM
- Option D (4 8/14): Added denominators (10 + 4 = 14) and didn't simplify properly

**What attracts each group:**
- Below basic students often add denominators directly or multiply them
- Basic students might get the right method but fail to convert improper to mixed
- Proficient students usually get this right but some might leave as improper fraction
- Advanced students should reliably get this correct

**Specific attractions:**
- Option A attracts students who calculate correctly but don't follow the "mixed number" instruction
- Option C attracts those who think "multiply the denominators" 
- Option D attracts those who add denominators and make arithmetic errors
