Let me work through this step by step to understand the errors students would make.

The correct solution:
Given: 10x - 6y = 30, and y = 0.5
Substitute: 10x - 6(0.5) = 30
10x - 3 = 30
10x = 33
x = 3.3

So the correct answer is C) 3.3

Now let me analyze the likely errors:

**Option A (4.25)**: This could come from students who:
- Make a sign error: 10x + 6(0.5) = 30, giving 10x + 3 = 30, so x = 2.7... wait, that's option D
- Or: 10x - 6y = 30, incorrectly solving 10x = 30 + 6(0.5) = 33, then making an arithmetic error

**Option B (-4.25)**: This likely comes from:
- Sign confusion throughout, perhaps thinking x should be negative
- Or major algebraic manipulation errors

**Option D (2.7)**: This is a very attractive wrong answer from:
- Sign error: 10x + 6(0.5) = 30
- 10x + 3 = 30
- 10x = 27
- x = 2.7
This feels "natural" because students often struggle with signs when rearranging.

**Option C (3.3)**: The correct answer requires careful sign handling and arithmetic.

Based on my experience with Year 9 students:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=35% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=70% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=2% C=88% D=5%
