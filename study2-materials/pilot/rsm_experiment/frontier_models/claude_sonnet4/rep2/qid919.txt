Let me think through this step by step.

The correct answer is A) 0.27, since y = 3x² = 3(0.3)² = 3(0.09) = 0.27.

Now for the common errors:

**Option A (0.81)**: This comes from calculating (3 × 0.3)² = 0.9² = 0.81. Students incorrectly multiply first, then square the entire result. This is a very attractive error because it feels natural to work left to right.

**Option B (0.27)**: This is the correct answer from properly following order of operations: 3 × (0.3)² = 3 × 0.09 = 0.27.

**Option C (1.8)**: This comes from calculating 3 × 0.3 × 2 = 1.8. Students misremember that x² means "times 2" rather than "times itself." This is a fundamental conceptual error.

**Option D (2.7)**: This comes from calculating 3 × 0.3 × 3 = 2.7. Students might think the coefficient 3 gets multiplied again, or confuse squaring with multiplying by the coefficient.

Thinking about ability levels:
- Below basic: Very confused about order of operations and what squaring means
- Basic: Know what squaring is but struggle with order of operations  
- Proficient: Understand the concepts and usually apply them correctly
- Advanced: Confident with algebraic substitution and checking their work
