Let me think through the common errors for this sphere volume question.

The correct formula is V = (4/3)πr³, so solving for r gives r = ∛(3V/4π), which is option C.

**Error analysis:**

**Option A: ∛(4Vπ/3)** - This comes from incorrectly rearranging V = (4/3)πr³ as r³ = (4Vπ/3). Students multiply V by the entire coefficient (4π/3) instead of dividing by it.

**Option B: ∛(4V/3π)** - This comes from V = (4/3)πr³ → r³ = V÷(4/3π) but treating division by a fraction incorrectly, getting (4V/3π) instead of (3V/4π).

**Option C: ∛(3V/4π)** - This is correct: V = (4/3)πr³ → r³ = 3V/4π → r = ∛(3V/4π)

**Option D: (3∛V)/(4π)** - This comes from incorrectly taking the cube root: ∛(3V/4π) = (3∛V)/(4π), forgetting that ∛(a/b) ≠ (∛a)/(b).

**Attractiveness of errors:**
- Option A feels natural when panicking about algebraic manipulation
- Option B is a very common fraction division error
- Option D looks sophisticated and could fool students who know some cube root rules
