Let me think through each option and what errors lead to them:

**Option A (4-5, then 4+5)**: Students who don't know BIDMAS/BODMAS at all and just work left to right for both problems. This is the most basic approach.

**Option B (4-5, then 5×6)**: CORRECT. Students who understand that multiplication comes before addition, but work left to right when operations have equal precedence (addition/subtraction).

**Option C (5+6, then 4+5)**: Students who think addition always comes before subtraction AND addition comes before multiplication. This is a confused understanding of order of operations.

**Option D (5+6, then 5×6)**: Students who think addition comes before subtraction (wrong) but correctly know multiplication comes before addition. Mixed understanding.

The key misconceptions:
- Many students think you always do addition before subtraction
- Some students don't know BIDMAS/BODMAS at all
- The "left to right" approach feels very natural
- Option B requires knowing both BIDMAS and left-to-right for equal precedence

Below basic students likely don't know order of operations at all. Basic students might know some rules but get confused. Proficient students should know BIDMAS but might slip on the equal precedence rule. Advanced students should get this completely right.

below_basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=70% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
