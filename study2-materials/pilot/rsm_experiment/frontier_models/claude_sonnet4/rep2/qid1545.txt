Let me work through this step by step, thinking about common student errors.

First, the correct calculation:
- Left side: 8 + 12 ÷ 4 = 8 + 3 = 11 (order of operations: division first)
- Right side: (8 + 12) ÷ 4 = 20 ÷ 4 = 5
- So 11 > 5, making A) > the correct answer

Now, let me consider the errors students make:

**Most common error**: Ignoring order of operations on the left side
- Students calculate 8 + 12 ÷ 4 as (8 + 12) ÷ 4 = 20 ÷ 4 = 5
- This makes both sides equal 5, leading them to choose C) =
- This is very "attractive" because students often work left to right

**Less common errors**: 
- Some might calculate incorrectly but still recognize inequality, guessing between > and <
- Very few would choose D) ≥ as it's not typically taught at this level for exact comparisons

**Ability level analysis**:

**Below basic students**: Most will ignore order of operations entirely, seeing both sides as equal. Some might guess randomly between inequalities.

**Basic students**: Many still struggle with order of operations, but some will get it right. Those who get it wrong will confidently choose =.

**Proficient students**: Most will apply order of operations correctly, though a few might still slip up under exam pressure.

**Advanced students**: Nearly all will get this correct, with maybe one or two careless errors.
