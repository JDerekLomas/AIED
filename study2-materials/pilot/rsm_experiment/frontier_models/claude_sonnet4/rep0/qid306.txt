Let me think through what students at each level would do with this order of operations question.

**Analysis of each option:**

Option A (4-5, then 4+5): Students who think you always work left to right, ignoring BIDMAS/PEMDAS completely.

Option B (4-5, then 5×6): Students who know multiplication comes before addition but think subtraction comes before addition too. This is the correct answer - left to right for Problem P (same precedence), multiplication first for Problem Q.

Option C (5+6, then 4+5): Students who might think addition always comes first, or who are completely confused about order.

Option D (5+6, then 5×6): Students who know multiplication beats addition but incorrectly think addition beats subtraction, so they skip over the 4 in Problem P.

**Key misconceptions:**
- Many students don't realize subtraction and addition have equal precedence (work left to right)
- Some students forget that multiplication beats addition
- "Left to right always" is a common fallback
- The correct answer (B) requires knowing both rules correctly

**Predictions based on typical Year 9 understanding:**

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=30% B=35% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=60% C=15% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
