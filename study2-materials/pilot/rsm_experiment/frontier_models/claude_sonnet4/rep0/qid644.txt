Looking at this question, I need to consider what happens when students multiply (-1) × (-4).

The correct answer is A) +4, since (-1) × (-4) = +4.

Let me think through the common errors:

**Error leading to B) -4**: Students who forget that "negative × negative = positive" and instead think it equals negative. This is a very common misconception.

**Error leading to C) +5**: Students who add instead of multiply: (-1) + (-4) = -5, but then apply a sign error to get +5. Or possibly (-1) + (-4) but forgetting the negatives entirely: 1 + 4 = 5.

**Error leading to D) -5**: Students who add instead of multiply: (-1) + (-4) = -5.

Now considering ability levels:

**Below basic**: These students struggle with negative number operations and often confuse addition/multiplication rules. The "add instead of multiply" error is very attractive, and many will get the sign wrong too.

**Basic**: These students know they should multiply but often mess up negative × negative rules. Some still confuse operations under pressure.

**Proficient**: Most know the rules but some might make careless errors or second-guess themselves.

**Advanced**: Should get this right consistently, with only occasional slips.

below_basic: A=15% B=35% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=8% D=7%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
