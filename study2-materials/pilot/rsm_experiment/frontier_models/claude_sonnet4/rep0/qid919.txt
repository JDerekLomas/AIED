Let me think through the common errors students make with this type of question.

The correct answer is: y = 3(0.3)² = 3 × 0.09 = 0.27, so B is correct.

**Analyzing each wrong answer:**

A) 0.81: This comes from calculating (0.3)² × 9 instead of × 3, or more likely from (0.9)² = 0.81 - substituting x = 0.9 instead of x = 0.3

B) 0.27: Correct answer

C) 1.8: This comes from 3 × 0.3 × 2 = 1.8, treating it like y = 3x × 2 rather than y = 3x²

D) 2.7: This is the very attractive error of calculating 3 × 0.3 × 3 = 2.7, essentially doing y = 3x × 3 instead of y = 3x²

**Key error patterns:**
- Not squaring the x value (just multiplying by 3, then by another number)
- Misreading the x value 
- Decimal calculation errors
- Not understanding what x² means

**Ability level analysis:**
- **Below basic**: Often don't square properly, attracted to simpler multiplication
- **Basic**: Mix up the order of operations, but can do basic decimal multiplication
- **Proficient**: Mostly get it right, some minor calculation slips
- **Advanced**: Should get this correct consistently
