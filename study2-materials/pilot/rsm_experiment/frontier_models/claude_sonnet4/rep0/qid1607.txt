Let me analyze this step by step, thinking about what students actually do when they see this type of question.

The equation is: 15 = (1+k)/4

Isaac's work:
Step 1: 60 = 1 + k (multiply both sides by 4)
Step 2: 61 = k (subtract 1 from both sides)

Both steps are mathematically correct. The correct answer is C.

Now, let me think about common student errors:

**Option A (Only step 1)**: Students might think step 1 is right but step 2 is wrong. This could happen if they don't understand that subtracting 1 from both sides is valid, or they think you should subtract 1 from only one side.

**Option B (Only step 2)**: This would mean they think step 1 is wrong but step 2 follows correctly from step 1. This seems less likely - if step 1 were wrong, how could step 2 be right?

**Option C (Both correct)**: This is the right answer.

**Option D (Both incorrect)**: Students might think Isaac should have done something different in step 1 (like dividing by 4 instead of multiplying), or they might not recognize valid algebraic manipulations.

The most attractive wrong answer is likely A, where students accept the multiplication by 4 but get confused about the subtraction step, possibly thinking you need to do something more complex.

Below basic students often struggle with multi-step equations and may not recognize valid operations. Basic students might get confused about the second step. Proficient students should mostly get this right, but some might second-guess themselves. Advanced students should confidently identify both steps as correct.

below_basic: A=35% B=10% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=8% C=45% D=7%
proficient: A=15% B=5% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
