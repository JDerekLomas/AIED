Let me work through this step by step, thinking about what errors lead to each option.

First, the correct answer: 2⁷⁄₁₀ + 2¹⁄₄ = 2¹⁴⁄₂₀ + 2⁵⁄₂₀ = 4¹⁹⁄₂₀, so B is correct.

Now analyzing each wrong option:

**Option A (⁹⁹⁄₂₀):** This comes from correctly finding 4¹⁹⁄₂₀ but then converting to improper fraction: 4¹⁹⁄₂₀ = (4×20+19)/20 = 99/20. The question asks for a mixed number, but some students always convert to improper fractions or miss the instruction.

**Option C (⁹⁹⁄₄₀):** This likely comes from finding common denominator of 40 (LCM of 10 and 4), getting 2²⁸⁄₄₀ + 2¹⁰⁄₄₀ = 4³⁸⁄₄₀, then making an arithmetic error (28+10=38, but 4×40=160, so 160+38=198, not 99). Or possibly adding whole and fractional parts incorrectly.

**Option D (4⁸⁄₁₄):** This comes from the attractive error of adding denominators: 7/10 + 1/4 becomes 8/14 (adding 7+1=8 and 10+4=14), plus 2+2=4. This "add the tops, add the bottoms" error is very common.

Considering ability levels:

- **Below basic:** Most likely to add denominators (option D) or make serious arithmetic errors. Some might stumble into other options.
- **Basic:** Some will get the method right but miss the mixed number instruction (option A), others still make the denominator addition error.
- **Proficient:** Mostly correct, with a few careless errors or misreading instructions.
- **Advanced:** Nearly all correct.
