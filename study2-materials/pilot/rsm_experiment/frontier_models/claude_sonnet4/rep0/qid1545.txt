Let me think through this step by step, considering what students actually do.

The correct calculation:
- Left side: 8 + 12 ÷ 4 = 8 + 3 = 11
- Right side: (8 + 12) ÷ 4 = 20 ÷ 4 = 5
- So 11 > 5, answer is A

**Common errors I'd expect:**

1. **Order of operations confusion**: Many students work left to right on the left side: (8 + 12) ÷ 4 = 20 ÷ 4 = 5, making both sides equal → C

2. **Brackets ignored**: Some might ignore brackets on right side and do 8 + 12 ÷ 4 for both sides → C

3. **Calculation errors**: Various arithmetic mistakes leading to different comparisons

4. **≥ confusion**: Some students who get 11 > 5 might think "well, ≥ includes > so that's more complete" → D

**Ability level analysis:**

**Below basic students**: Most likely to ignore order of operations entirely, work left to right on both sides, or make multiple calculation errors. The "both equal 5" trap is very attractive.

**Basic students**: Mixed results - some will remember BIDMAS/BODMAS but apply inconsistently. The equals trap is still very appealing.

**Proficient students**: Generally handle order of operations correctly, but some might second-guess themselves or fall for the ≥ "safer option" thinking.

**Advanced students**: Should get this right consistently, though a few might overthink the ≥ option.
