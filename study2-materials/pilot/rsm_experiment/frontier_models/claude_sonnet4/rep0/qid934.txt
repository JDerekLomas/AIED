Let me think through this systematically.

The correct answer is C) 5, since when x=0: 4(0) + 2y = 10, so 2y = 10, so y = 5.

**Error analysis:**

**Option A (20):** This comes from substituting x=0 and getting 2y=10, then thinking y=20 (doubling instead of halving). This is a very tempting arithmetic error.

**Option B (3):** This could come from 10-4=6, then 6÷2=3, or other muddled working. Less systematic but still plausible.

**Option D (2.5):** This comes from 10÷4=2.5, completely ignoring the 2y term. This feels "natural" to weaker students who might think "10 divided by 4".

**Ability level considerations:**

- **Advanced students:** Should get this right consistently, might briefly consider A but catch the error
- **Proficient students:** Most will get it right, but some might make the doubling error (A)
- **Basic students:** Split between the correct answer and attractive wrong answers A and D
- **Below basic students:** Often drawn to the "divide 10 by 4" thinking or other confused approaches
