Let me think through this step by step, considering what students at different levels would do.

The equation is: x/3 - 5 = 12

Tom's approach: x/3 = 17 (adding 5 to both sides - correct)
Katie's approach: x - 5 = 36 (multiplying both sides by 3 - also correct)

Both approaches are mathematically valid, so the answer is C) Both Tom and Katie.

Now for the error analysis:

**Below basic students** would likely:
- Not recognize that both operations are valid
- Might think only one method is "right" 
- Could be confused by seeing two different approaches
- Might guess or pick the first option they see

**Basic students** would:
- Probably recognize Tom's method (add 5 first) as this is typically taught first
- Might not realize Katie's method (multiply by 3 first) is also valid
- Could think "you have to do addition/subtraction before multiplication/division"
- Some might recognize both are correct

**Proficient students** should:
- Recognize both methods work due to properties of equality
- Understand order of operations doesn't restrict which inverse operation to apply first
- Most should get this right, though some might second-guess themselves

**Advanced students** would:
- Confidently recognize both approaches are valid
- Understand the algebraic principles involved
- Very few errors expected
