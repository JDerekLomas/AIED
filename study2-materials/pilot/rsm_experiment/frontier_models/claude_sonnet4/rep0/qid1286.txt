Let me think through the errors that lead to each option.

The correct formula is V = (4/3)πr³, so r = ∛(3V/4π), which is option C.

**Analysis of each option:**

A) ∛(4Vπ/3) - This comes from incorrectly rearranging V = (4/3)πr³ as r³ = V÷(3/4π) = 4Vπ/3. Students multiply by 4π instead of dividing, and divide by 3 instead of multiplying.

B) ∛(4V/3π) - This comes from correctly identifying the need to isolate r³, but forgetting to flip the fraction. Students get r³ = V÷(4π/3) but then write this as 4V/3π instead of 3V/4π.

C) ∛(3V/4π) - This is correct: V = (4/3)πr³ → r³ = 3V/4π → r = ∛(3V/4π)

D) (3∛V)/(4π) - This comes from taking the cube root of V separately, not understanding that you need to cube root the entire expression 3V/4π.

**Considering student behavior:**
- Below basic students often make multiple algebraic errors and are attracted to complex-looking expressions
- Basic students might get the rearrangement partially right but make one key error
- Proficient students usually get this right but some might make the "flip the fraction" error
- Advanced students should get this consistently correct
