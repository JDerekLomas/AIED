Let me think through the common errors students make with this type of question.

The correct answer is A) 81, since (-3)⁴ = (-3) × (-3) × (-3) × (-3) = 9 × 9 = 81.

**Error analysis:**

**Option C (-81):** This is the most attractive wrong answer. Students often think "negative number raised to a power = negative result" without considering that even powers of negative numbers are positive. They might calculate 3⁴ = 81 correctly but then make it negative.

**Option B (12):** This comes from the error k × 4 = (-3) × 4 = -12, then taking the absolute value, or confusing exponentiation with multiplication entirely.

**Option D (-12):** This is the direct error of treating k⁴ as k × 4, so (-3) × 4 = -12.

**Ability level considerations:**

- **Below basic:** Will often confuse exponentiation with multiplication, or apply incorrect sign rules
- **Basic:** Know it's exponentiation but struggle with negative number rules for even powers
- **Proficient:** Generally handle this correctly but some might second-guess themselves
- **Advanced:** Should get this right consistently

basic: A=60% B=10% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
