Let me think through the common errors I'd expect to see:

**Correct answer: A** - This is straightforward division notation as a fraction.

**Error analysis:**
- Option B (c+4)/(h+4): Students might think the "+4" applies to both numerator and denominator
- Option C: c/h + 4: Students might not understand that division by (h+4) means the entire expression (h+4) is the denominator, so they separate it
- Option D: (h+4)/c: Students flip the fraction, confusing division order

**Thinking about attractiveness of errors:**
- Option C is very attractive - students often struggle with brackets in denominators and naturally want to "distribute" or separate operations
- Option B appeals to students who think operations should be "balanced" 
- Option D catches students who mix up "a divided by b" vs "b divided by a"

**By ability level:**
- Below basic: High error rate, especially C and D
- Basic: Still struggle with C, some get it right
- Proficient: Mostly correct, occasional C error
- Advanced: Nearly all correct

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
