Let me analyze each option and the likely errors:

**Option A: (1+3+4+7)/5** - Excludes the 0 from the numerator but keeps 5 in denominator. This is a very common error where students think "0 doesn't count" or overlook it.

**Option B: 0+1+3+4+7÷5** - Order of operations error. Without brackets, this gives 0+1+3+4+(7÷5) = 9.4, not the correct mean of 3. Students often forget BIDMAS/BODMAS.

**Option C: (1+3+4+7)/4** - Excludes 0 from both numerator and denominator. Students think "we don't count the zero."

**Option D: None of them** - This is actually correct since the proper calculation should be (0+1+3+4+7)/5 = 15/5 = 3, which isn't shown.

**Analysis of attractiveness:**
- Option A is very tempting - students often ignore zeros
- Option C seems logical if you think zeros "don't count"  
- Option B looks right if you don't think about order of operations
- Option D requires recognizing all others are wrong AND that the correct answer isn't there
