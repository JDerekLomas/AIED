Let me work through this systematically, thinking about what students actually do when they see this type of question.

First, let me find the correct answer:
Given: 10x - 6y = 30, with y = 0.5
Substituting: 10x - 6(0.5) = 30
10x - 3 = 30
10x = 33
x = 3.3

So C) 3.3 is correct.

Now let me think about common errors:

**Error leading to A) 4.25:**
Students might substitute incorrectly: 10x - 6(0.5) = 30
But then add instead of subtract: 10x + 3 = 30, so 10x = 27, x = 2.7
Wait, that gives D. Let me reconsider...
Or they might make: 10x = 30 + 6(0.5) = 30 + 3 = 33, then divide by something other than 10.
Actually: 10x - 6y = 30, rearranging to x = (30 + 6y)/10 = (30 + 3)/10 = 33/10 = 3.3
But if they used x = (30 - 6y)/10 incorrectly: (30 - 3)/10 = 27/10 = 2.7

Let me try another path to 4.25: Maybe 10x = 30 + 6(0.5) + some extra error, or 10x = 42.5, giving x = 4.25.

**Error leading to B) -4.25:**
This is likely the negative version of whatever calculation gives 4.25.

**Error leading to D) 2.7:**
10x - 6(0.5) = 30
But they get the sign wrong: 10x + 3 = 30
10x = 27
x = 2.7

**Error leading to C) 3.3:**
This is the correct answer from proper substitution and solving.

Based on my experience with Year 9 students:

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=45% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=75% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
