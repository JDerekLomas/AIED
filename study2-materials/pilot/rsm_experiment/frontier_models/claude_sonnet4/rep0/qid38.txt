Let me think through the common errors students make with adding fractions involving algebra.

The correct answer is A) \(\frac{11}{2x}\).

To get this, students need to:
1. Find common denominator (2x)
2. Convert \(\frac{4}{x}\) to \(\frac{8}{2x}\)
3. Add: \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}\)

**Error Analysis:**

**Option B) \(\frac{7}{3x}\)** - This comes from adding numerators (3+4=7) and denominators (2+1=3), treating it like \(\frac{3}{2} + \frac{4}{1}\). Very common mistake.

**Option C) \(\frac{11}{x}\)** - Correct numerator (3+8=11) but uses x instead of 2x as denominator. Students found common denominator correctly but simplified incorrectly at the end.

**Option D) \(\frac{7}{2x}\)** - Just adds numerators (3+4=7) but keeps the 2x denominator from the first fraction. Shows some understanding but fundamental error.

**Ability Level Predictions:**

- **Below basic**: Most attractive error is adding numerators and denominators separately
- **Basic**: Split between the "add everything" error and getting numerator right but wrong denominator  
- **Proficient**: Most get it right, but some make the "lose the 2" error
- **Advanced**: Nearly all correct, with occasional careless errors
