Let me think through the common errors and approaches students would take with this equation: $-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$

**Correct approach**: Divide both sides by $-\frac{3}{4}$, which means multiply by $-\frac{4}{3}$:
$\star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} = \frac{4}{3}$ 

So A) $\frac{4}{3}$ is correct.

**Common errors I'd expect to see:**

**Error 1**: Sign confusion - many students struggle with negative × negative = positive, so they might think the answer should be negative, leading to B) $-\frac{4}{3}$

**Error 2**: Reciprocal confusion - some students know they need the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$ but forget about the sign, or think "just flip the fraction" without considering the negative properly

**Error 3**: "Cancelling" thinking - weaker students might think $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} = -1$ (this leads to C)

**Error 4**: Complete sign/operation confusion leading to D) $-\frac{3}{4}$

**Ability level predictions:**

- **Below basic**: Heavy confusion with signs and operations, many won't attempt systematic solving
- **Basic**: Know some methods but make sign errors or don't properly apply reciprocals  
- **Proficient**: Generally solid on method, occasional sign slips
- **Advanced**: Should get this right consistently
