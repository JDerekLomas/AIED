Let me analyze what errors lead to each option and how appealing they would be to different ability levels.

The correct answer is B) $m^2 - 12m + 35$.

**Error analysis:**
- Option A ($m^2 - 2m - 35$): This comes from incorrectly adding the middle terms: $-5m + (-7m) = -2m$ (wrong), and getting the constant wrong as $(-5) \times (-7) = -35$ (sign error)
- Option B: Correct answer using FOIL properly
- Option C ($m^2 + 12m + 35$): This comes from treating both brackets as positive, like $(m+5)(m+7)$ - a very common sign confusion
- Option D ($m^2 - 12m - 35$): Gets the middle term right but makes the classic error that $(-5) \times (-7) = -35$

**Attractiveness of errors:**
- Option A: Less attractive - requires multiple errors
- Option C: Very attractive - students often struggle with negative signs and default to positive
- Option D: Quite attractive - gets the linear term right but makes the "negative times negative equals negative" error

**By ability level:**

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=8% B=75% C=10% D=7%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%

The below basic students are most likely to pick C due to sign confusion. Basic students start getting it right more often but still fall for the attractive wrong answers. Proficient students mostly get it right with some still making sign errors. Advanced students rarely make mistakes on this fundamental skill.
