Let me think through the common errors and approaches for this equation:

**Correct method**: $10 = \frac{5}{p}$ → $10p = 5$ → $p = 0.5$

**Common errors I'd expect to see:**

1. **Cross-multiplication error**: Some students might write $10p = 5$ but then divide incorrectly, getting $p = \frac{10}{5} = 2$ (swapping the division)

2. **"Multiply both sides by p" confusion**: Students might get $10p = 5$ correctly but then think they need to divide 10 by 5 instead of 5 by 10

3. **Direct substitution error**: Some might think $p = 50$ by doing $10 \times 5 = 50$ (multiplying instead of dividing)

4. **Complete confusion**: Weakest students might pick "no solutions" when they can't solve it

**Ability level analysis:**

- **Advanced**: Will solve correctly and get A
- **Proficient**: Most will get it right, but some might make the division error leading to C
- **Basic**: Split between correct answer and common arithmetic errors
- **Below basic**: More random distribution, attracted to "nicer" numbers like 50 or 2
