Let me think through the common errors students make with this type of equation.

The correct answer is B) p = 1/36 (dividing both sides by 3: p = 1/12 ÷ 3 = 1/12 × 1/3 = 1/36)

**Common errors I'd expect:**

**Option A (p = 1/4)**: This comes from the very common error of thinking 1/12 ÷ 3 = 1/(12÷3) = 1/4. Students often incorrectly divide the denominator instead of multiplying by the reciprocal. This is extremely attractive because it "feels" logical.

**Option C (p = 4)**: This comes from students who think they should multiply both sides by 3, getting p = 1/12 × 3, but then calculate 12 × 3 = 36, so they think 1/12 × 3 = 36/12 = 3, or they might confuse themselves and get 4. Less common but happens.

**Option D (p = 1/9)**: This might come from students who remember they need to divide by 3 but incorrectly calculate 1/12 ÷ 3 as 1/(12-3) = 1/9, or some other arithmetic confusion.

**Ability level predictions:**

- **Below basic**: Most will choose the "attractive" wrong answer A, many won't attempt or will guess
- **Basic**: Many still fall for option A, but some get it right
- **Proficient**: Most get it correct, occasional careless errors
- **Advanced**: Nearly all correct
