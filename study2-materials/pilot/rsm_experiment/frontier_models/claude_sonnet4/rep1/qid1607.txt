Let me analyze this step by step, thinking about what students actually do in exams.

The equation is: 15 = (1+k)/4

Isaac's work:
Step 1: 60 = 1 + k (multiplied both sides by 4)
Step 2: 61 = k (subtracted 1 from both sides)

Both steps are mathematically correct, so the answer is C.

**Error analysis for wrong answers:**

**Option A (Only step 1):** Students who get this might think step 2 is wrong because they second-guess the arithmetic (60-1=59, not 61) or don't understand that subtracting 1 from both sides is valid.

**Option B (Only step 2):** Students might think step 1 is wrong because they believe you should divide by 4 instead of multiply, or they make an error checking 15×4=60.

**Option D (Both incorrect):** Students who fundamentally misunderstand equation solving or make multiple conceptual errors.

**Attractiveness of errors:**
- Many students will double-check by substituting back, which helps them reach C
- The "multiply both sides by 4" step feels natural to most Year 9 students
- However, some students panic when they see 61 as an answer (seems "too big")
- Some students will second-guess correct arithmetic under exam pressure

**By ability level:**

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
