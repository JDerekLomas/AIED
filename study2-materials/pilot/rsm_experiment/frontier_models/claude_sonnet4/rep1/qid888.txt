Let me think through the common errors students make when expanding $(m-5)(m-7)$.

The correct answer is B) $m^2 - 12m + 35$ using FOIL:
- First: $m \times m = m^2$
- Outer: $m \times (-7) = -7m$
- Inner: $(-5) \times m = -5m$
- Last: $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$
- Combined: $m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35$

Common errors:
- **Option A** ($m^2 - 2m - 35$): Students get the middle term wrong, possibly doing $-7 + 5 = -2$ instead of $-7 - 5 = -12$, and mess up the sign on the constant term
- **Option C** ($m^2 + 12m + 35$): Students forget the negative signs entirely, treating it as $(m+5)(m+7)$
- **Option D** ($m^2 - 12m - 35$): Students get the middle term right but make the classic error with "negative times negative" for the constant term

The most attractive wrong answers:
- Option D is very tempting because students often struggle with (-5) × (-7) = +35
- Option A might catch students who make multiple sign errors
- Option C catches those who ignore the minus signs completely

Below basic students often make multiple errors and guess.
Basic students might get one part right but struggle with signs.
Proficient students usually get it right but some fall for the (-5) × (-7) trap.
Advanced students should get this reliably correct.
