Let me think through the common errors students make with this type of question.

The correct answer is A) 81, since (-3)⁴ = (-3) × (-3) × (-3) × (-3) = 81.

**Error analysis:**

**Option A (81)** - Correct answer. Students need to understand that an even power of a negative number is positive.

**Option B (12)** - This likely comes from students who confuse exponentiation with multiplication: k⁴ → 4k, so 4 × (-3) = -12, but they might drop the negative sign or make some other arithmetic error to get 12.

**Option C (-81)** - This is the most attractive wrong answer. Students correctly calculate 3⁴ = 81 but incorrectly think the negative sign carries through, not understanding that (-3)⁴ ≠ -(3⁴) when the power is even.

**Option D (-12)** - Students who think k⁴ means 4k: 4 × (-3) = -12. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of notation.

**By ability level:**

- **Below basic**: Often confuse exponentiation with multiplication, don't understand negative number rules
- **Basic**: May calculate correctly but struggle with negative number rules for even powers
- **Proficient**: Understand the operations but might make careless errors with signs
- **Advanced**: Should get this correct consistently
