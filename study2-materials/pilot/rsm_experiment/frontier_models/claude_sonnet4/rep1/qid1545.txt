Let me work through this step by step, thinking about common student errors.

The correct calculation:
- Left side: 8 + 12 ÷ 4 = 8 + 3 = 11 (order of operations: division first)
- Right side: (8 + 12) ÷ 4 = 20 ÷ 4 = 5
- So 11 > 5, answer is A

**Common errors I'd expect to see:**

1. **Order of operations error (most attractive trap)**: Students calculate left side as (8 + 12) ÷ 4 = 5, making both sides equal, leading to answer C

2. **Reverse inequality confusion**: Some students get the correct values (11 and 5) but write 11 < 5, choosing B

3. **≥ vs > confusion**: Students who get 11 > 5 might think "greater than or equal" is "more correct" or "safer"

**Ability level analysis:**

**Below basic students**: Most likely to ignore order of operations entirely, making both sides equal. Some random guessing.

**Basic students**: Many will make the order of operations error but work systematically. Some will get correct values but mix up inequality direction.

**Proficient students**: Most will apply order of operations correctly, though some might second-guess themselves or make careless errors.

**Advanced students**: Should get this right consistently, with only occasional slips.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=5% D=3%
