Let me think through this step by step, considering what students at each level would do.

**Correct answer analysis:**
- Problem P: 4-5+6 → left to right, so 4-5 first
- Problem Q: 4+5×6 → order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), so 5×6 first
- Correct answer is B

**Error analysis:**

**Option A (4-5, then 4+5):** Students who work left-to-right for both problems, ignoring order of operations entirely.

**Option B (4-5, then 5×6):** Correct answer - left-to-right for P, multiplication first for Q.

**Option C (5+6, then 4+5):** Students who think you should work right-to-left, or get confused about which operation to do first in both cases.

**Option D (5+6, then 5×6):** Students who think multiplication always goes first (overgeneralizing BIDMAS) for P, but correctly apply it for Q.

**Ability level predictions:**

**Below basic:** These students often don't know BIDMAS at all, or apply it inconsistently. Many will default to left-to-right reading.

**Basic:** Know BIDMAS exists but make errors applying it. Some overgeneralize rules.

**Proficient:** Generally apply BIDMAS correctly but may occasionally slip.

**Advanced:** Solid understanding of order of operations.

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=35% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=2% B=92% C=1% D=5%
