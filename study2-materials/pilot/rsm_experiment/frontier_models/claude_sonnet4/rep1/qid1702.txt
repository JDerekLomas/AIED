Let me work through this step by step to understand the errors.

The correct method: Substitute y = 0.5 into 10x - 6y = 30
10x - 6(0.5) = 30
10x - 3 = 30
10x = 33
x = 3.3

So the correct answer is C) 3.3.

Now let me analyze the likely errors for each wrong option:

**Option A) 4.25:** This could come from:
- Substituting incorrectly: 10x - 6y = 30, thinking it's 10x + 6(0.5) = 30, so 10x = 30 - 3 = 27, x = 2.7... wait, that's not 4.25
- Actually, 10x - 6(0.5) = 30 but making an arithmetic error: 10x + 3 = 30 (sign error), 10x = 27, x = 2.7... still not matching
- More likely: 10x - 6(0.5) = 30, getting 10x - 3 = 30, then 10x = 30 + 3 = 33, but then dividing incorrectly or some other arithmetic slip

**Option B) -4.25:** This negative result suggests a sign error early on, possibly rearranging the equation incorrectly.

**Option D) 2.7:** This comes from the attractive error of getting 10x = 27 instead of 10x = 33. This happens when students write 10x + 3 = 30 instead of 10x - 3 = 30 (sign error with the -6(0.5)).

**Error Analysis:**
- D) 2.7 is very attractive because -6(0.5) = -3, but students often lose track of signs
- A) 4.25 seems less systematic as an error
- B) -4.25 would come from more fundamental confusion
- C) 3.3 requires careful arithmetic throughout

**Student behavior by level:**
- Below basic: Struggle with substitution, make multiple errors
- Basic: Can substitute but make arithmetic/sign errors
- Proficient: Generally get it right but some slip-ups
