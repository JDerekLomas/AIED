Let me think through the errors students typically make with this type of question.

The correct answer is A) $\frac{4}{3}$, since $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1$.

**Error analysis:**

**Option B) $-\frac{4}{3}$** - This is the most attractive wrong answer. Students often think "I need the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$, which is $\frac{4}{3}$, and since there's a negative sign, I need $-\frac{4}{3}$." They forget that $-\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{4}{3} = +1$, not $-1$.

**Option C) $\frac{3}{4}$** - Students might think they need to "cancel out" the fraction, not realizing they need the reciprocal. This gives $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} = -\frac{9}{16}$.

**Option D) $-\frac{3}{4}$** - Similar error to C, but thinking the negative sign matters. This gives $-\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{16}$.

**Ability level predictions:**

- **Below basic**: Often guess or use flawed reasoning about signs
- **Basic**: Know about reciprocals but struggle with negative signs
- **Proficient**: Usually get reciprocals right and can handle the sign work
- **Advanced**: Systematic approach, likely to check their answer
