Let me work through this systematically.

The correct answer is: y = 3(0.3)² = 3(0.09) = 0.27, so B is correct.

Now let me analyze each wrong answer and what error leads to it:

**Option A (0.81):** This comes from calculating (0.3)² × 9 = 0.09 × 9 = 0.81. Students might misread the coefficient as 9 instead of 3, or think 3² = 9 should be used.

**Option C (1.8):** This comes from 3 × 0.3 × 2 = 1.8. Students forget to square and instead think the ² means "times 2" - a very common misconception at this level.

**Option D (2.7):** This comes from 3 × 0.3 × 3 = 2.7. Students might think x² means "times x again" so 3 × 0.3 × 0.3 × 3, or confuse the squaring process entirely.

**Error attractiveness:**
- Option C is very attractive because "x²" looking like "x times 2" is a persistent misconception
- Option B requires careful decimal arithmetic that many students struggle with
- The squaring of decimals is particularly challenging for weaker students

**Student behavior by level:**
- Advanced students will methodically substitute and calculate correctly
- Proficient students mostly get it right but some might make arithmetic errors
- Basic students often confuse the squaring notation or make decimal errors  
- Below basic students frequently fall into the "x² means times 2" trap
