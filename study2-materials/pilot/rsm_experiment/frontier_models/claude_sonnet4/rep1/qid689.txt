Let me think through the common errors and approaches for this equation solving question.

The correct method is:
$10 = \frac{5}{p}$
Multiply both sides by $p$: $10p = 5$
Divide by 10: $p = 0.5$

So A is correct.

Common errors I'd expect:

**Error leading to B (p=50):** Students multiply instead of divide: $10 \times 5 = 50$. This is very attractive because when they see numbers, they often just multiply them together without thinking about the algebraic structure.

**Error leading to C (p=2):** Students think "what goes into 10 to give 5?" and answer 2, or they do $\frac{10}{5} = 2$. This comes from misunderstanding the relationship in the fraction.

**Error leading to D:** Some students might think you can't solve it because of the fraction, or they might check their answer incorrectly and conclude no solution exists.

**Ability level analysis:**

- **Below basic:** Often just guess or use intuitive but wrong operations
- **Basic:** Might get the method but make arithmetic errors, or use partially correct approaches  
- **Proficient:** Should get this right with proper algebraic manipulation
- **Advanced:** Definitely should get this correct and likely check their answer

below_basic: A=15% B=35% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=8% C=5% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
