Let me analyze this step by step, thinking about what students would actually do.

The equation is: x/3 - 5 = 12

Tom's approach: x/3 = 17 (adding 5 to both sides - CORRECT)
Katie's approach: x - 5 = 36 (multiplying both sides by 3 - CORRECT)

Both are mathematically valid first steps, so C) is correct.

**Error analysis:**

Option A (Only Tom): Students who think you must always isolate the fraction first, not recognizing Katie's valid approach of multiplying through by 3.

Option B (Only Katie): Students who think Tom made an arithmetic error (12 + 5 = 17) or don't understand that you can add before multiplying.

Option D (Neither): Students who are completely confused about equation solving or think both approaches contain errors.

**Student thinking patterns:**

- Below basic: Often confused about order of operations in equations, likely to pick based on which "looks right"
- Basic: Know one method well but may not recognize alternative valid approaches
- Proficient: Understand multiple approaches but may second-guess themselves
- Advanced: Confidently recognize both as valid algebraic manipulations

**Attractive errors:**
- Option A is attractive because many students learn "isolate the variable term first"
- Option B might attract students who prefer Katie's approach of "clear fractions first"
- Option D attracts students who overthink and convince themselves both must be wrong
