Let me think through this step by step, considering what Year 9 students would actually do.

The correct answer: When x = 0, we have 4(0) + 2y = 10, so 2y = 10, therefore y = 5. Answer is C.

**Error analysis:**

**Option A (20):** This comes from thinking y = 10/2 but then doubling it, or substituting incorrectly and getting y = 20 somehow. This is quite far from reasonable answers, so only the most confused students would pick this.

**Option B (3):** This likely comes from students who see the pattern isn't obvious and guess, or who make arithmetic errors. Some might think 4x + 2y = 10 becomes 2y = 10 - 4, then y = 3. Not a super obvious error path.

**Option C (5):** Correct answer. 4(0) + 2y = 10, so 2y = 10, so y = 5.

**Option D (2.5):** This is very attractive! Students often substitute x = 0 correctly to get 2y = 10, but then think "10 divided by 2y means 10 ÷ 4 = 2.5" or they solve 4y = 10 instead of 2y = 10. This feels mathematically sophisticated to weaker students.

**Below basic students:** Will struggle with substitution and equation solving. Many will guess or make major errors.

**Basic students:** Can substitute but often make algebraic mistakes. The 2.5 trap will catch many.

**Proficient students:** Should get this right but some might still fall for computational errors.

**Advanced students:** Should reliably get this correct.
