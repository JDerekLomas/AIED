Let me think through the calculation errors and what students actually do:

The correct answer is A) 6, following order of operations: 3 - 5 + 4 × 2 = 3 - 5 + 8 = 6

**Error analysis:**
- **Option B (4)**: Working left to right: 3 - 5 = -2, then -2 + 4 = 2, then 2 × 2 = 4. This is the most "natural" error - ignoring order of operations completely.
- **Option C (-12)**: Working left to right but treating the result as negative: (3 - 5 + 4) × 2 = 2 × 2 = 4, but somehow getting -12. This might come from 3 - 5 = -2, then (-2 + 4) × 2 = 2 × 2 = 4, but they mess up signs. Actually, more likely: 3 - (5 + 4) × 2 = 3 - 18 = -15... no. Actually: doing 3 - 5 = -2, then -2 + 4 × 2 but calculating (-2 + 4) × 2 = 2 × 2 = 4, then making a sign error. Hard to get -12 cleanly.
- **Option D (-10)**: This could be 3 - 5 + 4 × 2 calculated as 3 - (5 + 4 × 2) = 3 - (5 + 8) = 3 - 13 = -10. This shows some awareness of order of operations but applying brackets incorrectly.

**Most attractive errors:**
- Left-to-right calculation (leading to B) is very natural
- Misapplying order of operations (leading to D) shows partial knowledge
