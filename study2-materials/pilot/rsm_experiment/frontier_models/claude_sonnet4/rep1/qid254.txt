Let me think through what errors lead to each option and how attractive they are to different ability levels.

**Option A: (1+3+4+7)/5** - This omits the 0 from the numerator but keeps 5 in the denominator. This is a very common error where students think "0 doesn't count" or "ignore the zero."

**Option B: 0+1+3+4+7÷5** - This has an order of operations error. Students write it as they think it, not realizing that division happens before addition, giving 0+1+3+4+1.4 = 9.4 instead of 3.

**Option C: (1+3+4+7)/4** - This omits 0 from both numerator and denominator. Students think "don't count the zero at all."

**Option D: None of them** - This is actually correct since the right answer should be (0+1+3+4+7)/5.

The "attractive" errors:
- Ignoring zero is very tempting for weaker students
- Order of operations confusion in option B catches many students
- Better students are more likely to spot that all given options are wrong

Below basic students often don't even recognize when zero should be included and struggle with order of operations.

Basic students might catch some errors but still get confused by zero.

Proficient students are more likely to work through this carefully and spot the issues.

Advanced students should reliably identify that none of the options are correct.

proficient: A=15% B=10% C=15% D=60%
