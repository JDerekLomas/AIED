Let me think through the calculation and potential errors:

Correct calculation: 2⁷⁄₁₀ + 2¼ = 2¹⁴⁄₂₀ + 2⁵⁄₂₀ = 4¹⁹⁄₂₀

Now analyzing each option:

**Option A (⁹⁹⁄₂₀)**: This comes from correctly getting 4¹⁹⁄₂₀ but then converting to improper fraction: 4×20+19=99. However, the question asks for a mixed number, so this shows good calculation but poor question reading.

**Option B (4¹⁹⁄₂₀)**: This is the correct answer.

**Option C (⁹⁹⁄₄₀)**: This likely comes from adding fractions incorrectly - perhaps getting ⁷⁄₁₀ + ¼ = ²⁸⁄₄₀ + ¹⁰⁄₄₀ = ³⁸⁄₄₀, then 2+2+³⁸⁄₄₀, but making errors in the process. This is a messy calculation error.

**Option D (4⁸⁄₁₄)**: This comes from the attractive error of adding numerators (7+1=8) and denominators (10+4=14) directly, then adding the whole numbers correctly (2+2=4).

**Error analysis:**
- Option A: Good math skills, poor exam technique
- Option B: Correct
- Option C: Multiple calculation errors
- Option D: Very common "add tops and bottoms" misconception
