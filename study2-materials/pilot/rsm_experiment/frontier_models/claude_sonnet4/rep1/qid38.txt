Let me think through the common errors students make with this algebraic fraction addition.

The correct answer is A) 11/(2x). To get this, students need to:
1. Find common denominator (2x)
2. Convert 4/x to 8/(2x)
3. Add: 3/(2x) + 8/(2x) = 11/(2x)

**Error analysis:**

**Option A (11/2x) - CORRECT**
- Requires proper common denominator work

**Option B (7/3x)**
- This comes from adding numerators (3+4=7) and denominators (2x+x=3x)
- Very attractive error - feels natural to "add fractions by adding tops and bottoms"
- Common misconception at this level

**Option C (11/x)**
- Students find correct numerator (11) but use wrong denominator
- Might think common denominator is just x, or simplify incorrectly

**Option D (7/2x)**
- Adds numerators incorrectly (3+4=7) but gets denominator right (2x)
- Could come from various mixed-up approaches

**Ability level predictions:**

**Below basic:** Likely to add numerators and denominators straight across, or make multiple errors
**Basic:** May know some fraction rules but apply incorrectly or inconsistently  
**Proficient:** Generally handle algebraic fractions correctly with occasional slips
**Advanced:** Should get this right routinely
