Let me think through the common errors students make with this type of equation.

The correct solution is: 3p = 1/12, so p = 1/12 ÷ 3 = 1/12 × 1/3 = 1/36

So B) p = 1/36 is correct.

Common errors I'd expect:

**Option A (p = 1/4)**: Students who think 3p = 1/12 means p = 1/12 + 3 or make some other conceptual error about inverse operations.

**Option C (p = 4)**: Very attractive error! Students who think "to get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides by 12" getting 36p = 1, then incorrectly think p = 36 or make arithmetic errors. Some might also flip 1/12 to get 12, then think 3p = 12 so p = 4.

**Option D (p = 1/9)**: Students who correctly identify they need to divide by 3, but make the error 1/12 ÷ 3 = 1/(12-3) = 1/9, or think dividing by 3 means subtracting 3 from the denominator.

Below basic students often struggle with fraction operations and inverse operations. Basic students might get the method right but make arithmetic errors. Proficient students should get this mostly correct. Advanced students should reliably solve this.
