Let me think through the specific errors students would make when solving this sphere volume problem.

The correct approach is: V = (4/3)πr³, so r³ = 3V/(4π), therefore r = ∛(3V/4π) - which is option C.

**Analysis of each wrong answer:**

**Option A: ∛(4Vπ/3)** - This comes from incorrectly rearranging V = (4/3)πr³ as r³ = (4Vπ)/3. Students multiply both sides by 4π/3 instead of dividing by it. This is a very attractive error because students often get confused about whether to multiply or divide when rearranging.

**Option B: ∛(4V/3π)** - This comes from writing V = (4/3)πr³ then rearranging as r³ = 4V/(3π). Students correctly divide by 4π/3 but treat it as multiplying by 4/(3π) instead of 3/(4π). This feels "close" to correct.

**Option D: (3∛V)/(4π)** - This comes from the misconception that ∛(ab) = a∛b, writing ∛(3V/4π) = (3∛V)/(4π). This is an index law error that some students make.

**Ability level predictions:**

**Below basic:** These students struggle with formula manipulation and often make fundamental errors. They're drawn to options that "look right" without checking.

**Basic:** These students know the volume formula but make rearrangement errors. The multiply/divide confusion in option A is very common at this level.

**Proficient:** These students can usually rearrange correctly but might make small errors under exam pressure or second-guess themselves.

**Advanced:** These students should get this right consistently, with only occasional careless errors.
