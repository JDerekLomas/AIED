Let me think through the common errors and misconceptions for this algebraic notation question.

The correct answer is A) $\frac{c}{h+4}$, which properly represents $c \div (h+4)$.

**Error analysis for each wrong option:**

Option B) $\frac{c+4}{h+4}$ - Students might think both parts of the division get the "+4" added. This shows confusion about what's being divided by what.

Option C) $\frac{c}{h}+4$ - This is a very attractive error. Students see $c \div (h+4)$ and incorrectly think the division operation only applies to the first part, then add 4. This misunderstands the brackets entirely.

Option D) $\frac{h+4}{c}$ - This flips the dividend and divisor completely. Students who struggle with the concept of "what divided by what" might choose this.

**Ability level considerations:**

- **Below basic**: Will struggle with division notation and bracket understanding. Option C looks appealing because they might process left-to-right incorrectly.
- **Basic**: Some will get it right, but many will fall for the attractive error in C or get confused about which goes where.
- **Proficient**: Most should recognize the correct fraction form, with only occasional errors.
- **Advanced**: Should consistently get this correct, with rare slips.

basic: A=55% B=15% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
