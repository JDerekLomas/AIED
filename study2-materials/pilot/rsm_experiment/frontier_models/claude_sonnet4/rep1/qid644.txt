Let me think through the errors students typically make with this type of question.

The correct answer is A) +4, since (-1) × (-4) = +4.

**Common errors I'd expect:**

**Option B (-4):** Students who forget that "negative × negative = positive" - a very common error, especially when they see two negative numbers and instinctively think the result must be negative.

**Option C (+5) and D (-5):** Students who add instead of multiply: (-1) + (-4) = -5, or possibly (-1) + (-4) with sign confusion giving +5. Some students mix up operations when expanding brackets.

**Ability level analysis:**

**Below basic students:** Often struggle with negative number rules and may confuse operations entirely. Many will fall for the "two negatives make a negative" trap.

**Basic students:** Some know the rules but apply them inconsistently under pressure. The most common error will be getting -4.

**Proficient students:** Generally know negative number rules well and recognize this as straightforward multiplication. A few might still slip up.

**Advanced students:** Should get this correct routinely - it's a fundamental skill they've mastered.
