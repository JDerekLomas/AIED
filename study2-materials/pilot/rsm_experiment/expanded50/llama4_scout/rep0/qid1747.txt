## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks how many degrees Ada has turned from facing Northwest (NW) to facing South (S). 

## 2: Identifying Key Directions and Their Angles
- Northwest (NW) is at 315 degrees on a compass (since North is 0/360 degrees, and each direction is 45 degrees apart: North = 0, Northeast = 45, East = 90, Southeast = 135, South = 180, Southwest = 225, West = 270, Northwest = 315).
- South (S) is at 180 degrees.

## 3: Calculating the Turn
To find out how many degrees Ada turned from NW to S, we subtract the angle of NW from the angle of S: \(180 - 315 = -135\) degrees. Since we're looking for the amount of turn and direction doesn't matter for the magnitude, we consider the absolute value, which is \(135\) degrees. However, another way to think about it is that Ada could have turned clockwise directly, which would be 135 degrees, or counter-clockwise, which would be 360 - 135 = 225 degrees.

## 4: Analyzing Errors for Wrong Answers
A) \(225^{\degree}\): This would occur if a student mistakenly calculated the turn as going counter-clockwise instead of clockwise, or simply added 180 to 45 (the quarter circle from NW to N, then half circle from N to S) incorrectly.

B) \(315^{\degree}\): A student might choose this if they misunderstood the question to mean Ada turned from NW to S and then back towards NW but only got so far as 315 degrees short of a full circle (which doesn’t make sense) or simply miscalculated entirely.

C) \(135^{\degree}\): This is the correct answer. A student chooses another option instead may have miscalculated the actual degrees turned.

D) \(180^{\degree}\): This error could happen if a student thought Ada turned directly south from northwest through north, implying a 180-degree line straight down, not accounting for the positions.

## 5: Error Analysis
A) A student might mistakenly think Ada makes more than a quarter turn directly or misinterpret the position turn needed, counter-clockwise calculation leads to \(360 - 135 = 225\).

B) A significant misconception; doesn't relate straightforwardly to adding or simple mistaken understanding.

C) Not choosing C, means missing the proper method/subtract NW from S. 

D) Simplistic error treating from NW in a semi circular to direct S rather through calculation steps effectively getting their positions misplace.

## 6: Predictions Based on Mathematical Understanding and Likely Misconceptions
- **Below Basic:** At this level, understanding of directional math and degrees on a compass might be sparse. Hence errors related to full rotations or misinterpreting simple positional changes like \(180^\circ\) would occur.
- **Basic:** A grasp of some mathematical ideas; understanding not totally on concepts or relating position; they perform with calculation not directly relevant method resulting option D being popular because semi-circle consideration relates easier.

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student calculates the turn in the wrong direction (counter-clockwise) or misinterprets positions resulting in 225 degrees - as essentially: more turn then NW requires; and thinks 90*(3+ quarter)=more  
B) Possibly relates turning 360-45= to getting  a more complicated full calculation to give degree angles between S  to add some turn back wrong compass use then over turn 
C) no apparent obvious widespread errors needed on understanding on 
D) misjudges semi to think direct line equatable
