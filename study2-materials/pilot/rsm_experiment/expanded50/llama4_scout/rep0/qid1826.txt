## Step 1: Understanding the equation
The given equation is \( y = 2^x \). We need to find \( y \) when \( x = -5 \).

## 2: Calculating the correct value
To find \( y \) when \( x = -5 \), we substitute \( x \) in the equation: \( y = 2^{-5} \). Using the rule \( a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n} \), we get \( y = \frac{1}{2^5} = \frac{1}{32} \).

## 3: Error Analysis for A
A) A student choosing A (\( -32 \)) might be confusing the operation with \( -2^5 \) or mistakenly applying a rule that doesn't apply here, such as \( 2^{-x} = -2^x \), which is incorrect.

## 4: Error Analysis for B
B) A student choosing B (\( -\frac{1}{32} \)) might be misapplying the negative exponent rule or mistakenly thinking that a negative exponent results in a negative value, not understanding that \( 2^{-x} \) yields a positive fraction.

## 5: Error Analysis for C
C) A student choosing C (\( -10 \)) might not understand exponents and negative numbers, possibly calculating \( 2 \times -5 \) or another incorrect operation.

## 6: Error Analysis for D
D) A student choosing D (\( \frac{1}{32} \)) understands the equation \( y = 2^x \) and correctly applies the exponent rule for negative numbers.

## 7: Predictions
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand negative exponents or basic operations. They could mistakenly calculate or choose an answer based on incorrect rules. Predictions: A=30% (simple miscalculation), B=20% (misunderstanding of negative exponent), C=30% (completely off, possibly due to not following any rules), D=20% (some might get it right by chance or basic understanding).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding but might still struggle with negative exponents. Predictions: A=20%, B=25%, C=20%, D=35%.
- **Proficient**: Students here understand the concept of exponents and negatives. Predictions: A=10%, B=15%, C=5%, D=70%.
- **Advanced**: These students are confident and accurate with exponents. Predictions: A=5%, B=5%, C=0%, D=90%.

## 8: Finalizing Predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=30%, B=20%, C=30%, D=20%
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=25%, C=20%, D=35%
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=15%, C=5%, D=70%
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=5%, C=0%, D=90%

The best answer is D.
