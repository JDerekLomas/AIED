## Error Analysis:

A) To arrive at answer A (14), a student might incorrectly add the numbers instead of performing the subtraction and incorrectly handling the negative sign. The correct operation is \(6 - (-8)\), which can be thought of as \(6 + 8 = 14\). However, a student choosing A directly might simply be adding without considering the sign change properly.

B) For answer B (-14), a student might incorrectly subtract the absolute values and then apply the wrong sign. The calculation could mistakenly go as \(-8 - 6 = -14\) or simply misinterpreting the double negative as a double negative outcome.

C) For answer C (2), a student might be misunderstanding the effect of subtracting a negative number. If they view \(6 - (-8)\) as \(6 - 8 = -2\) or simply miscalculate without correctly applying the rule for subtracting negatives.

D) For answer D (-2), similarly, a student might not correctly apply the subtraction of a negative, incorrectly viewing it as \(6 + (-8) = -2\).

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students struggle with basic arithmetic operations and sign rules. 
  - A=40% (simply not applying the correct operation and overlooking the negative sign)
  - B=20% (misapplying operations and sign rules in a negative context)
  - C=15% (misunderstanding the subtraction of a negative as a direct subtraction)
  - D=25% (applying addition with a negative incorrectly)

- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic operations but still make errors with negative numbers.
  - A=20% (confusing the operation with simple addition)
  - B=15% (having trouble correctly applying two negative signs)
  - C=30% (confusion over sign changes with operations)
  - D=35% (addition/subtraction confusion)

- **Proficient:** These students understand basic operations and common misconceptions are fewer.
  - A=5% (careless oversight)
  - B=5% (misremembering signs)
  - C=20% (common trap of forgetting to change the sign)
  - D=70% (correctly solving but let's account accurately based on common error less with proper)

- **Advanced:** Students here grasp complex problems but the question could still trap some if rushed.
  - A=0% (clear grasp of the positive outcome from basics concepts review subtraction to gain positives double effect on understanding)

 Given we reframe and properly align. This detailed insight actually supports the expected response rates accurately for all skill level students and their likely approach for these conceptual simple arithmetic problems . Let's now frame within instructed response mechanism accurately given final results are in:

The final answer is: 
Error Analysis:
A) A student might add the numbers without handling the negative sign properly.
B) A student might misinterpret the double negative, leading to an incorrect negative result.
C) A student might not correctly change the subtraction of a negative to an addition.
D) A student might simply subtract without considering the change in sign.
