## Step 1: Analyzing the given equation and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \(k\), one should first multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which yields \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \), simplifying to \( 60 = 1 + k \).

## 2: Evaluating Isaac's steps
Isaac's Step 1: \( 60 = 1 + k \) is correct because multiplying both sides of the original equation by 4 gives \( 60 = 1 + k \).

## 3: Continuing with Isaac's steps
Isaac's Step 2: \( 61 = k \) is also correct because subtracting 1 from both sides of \( 60 = 1 + k \) gives \( k = 59 \), but Isaac wrote \( 61 = k \), which is incorrect. The correct calculation from Step 1 would lead to \( k = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 4: Identifying errors for each wrong answer
Error Analysis:
A) Choosing A implies that only Step 1 is correct. A student might choose this if they see Step 1 as correct but do not verify Step 2, or if they incorrectly believe Step 2 is wrong without checking its validity.
B) Choosing B implies that only Step 2 is correct, which would mean a student believes Step 2 is correct but Step 1 is wrong. This could happen if a student incorrectly calculates or verifies the steps.
C) Choosing C implies both steps are correct, which would be a misconception since Step 2 incorrectly states \( 61 = k \) when it should be \( 59 = k \).
D) Choosing D implies both steps are incorrect. A student might choose this if they correctly identify that Step 2 is incorrect but also mistakenly believe Step 1 is incorrect.

## 5: Specific errors leading to each choice
- A: Believing Step 1 is correct but not recognizing the error in Step 2 or not bothering to check Step 2.
- B: Incorrectly believing Step 2 is correct and not noticing the actual error in Step 2 or mistakenly thinking Step 1 is wrong.
- C: Incorrectly believing both steps are correct, likely due to not actually solving the equation to verify Isaac's steps.
- D: Recognizing that Step 2 is incorrect but also understanding that Step 1, while看起来 correct, leads to an incorrect conclusion in Step 2.

## 6: Predicting response distribution based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple procedural errors), B=20% (misunderstanding of basic algebraic manipulations), C=10% (lack of understanding of the equation), D=40% (overall confusion).
- **Basic**: A=20% (some understanding but prone to errors), B=15% (partial understanding of algebra), C=15% (some procedural understanding but lacking verification), D=50% (begin to recognize errors).
- **Proficient**: A=10% (strong understanding, less likely to make simple errors), B=5% (solid grasp of algebra), C=5% (exceptionally careful), D=80% (clearly understand the correct and incorrect steps).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (very strong understanding), B=0% (exceptional algebraic understanding), C=0% (rapid and accurate verification), D=95% (very accurate analysis).

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might choose this if they see Step 1 as correct but do not verify Step 2, or if they incorrectly believe Step 2 is wrong without checking its validity.
B) A student might choose B if they incorrectly calculate or verify the steps, believing Step 2 is correct but Step 1 is wrong.
C) A student might choose C if they do not actually solve the equation to verify Isaac's steps, incorrectly believing both are correct.
D) A student might choose D if they correctly identify that Step 2 is incorrect but also understand that Step 1, while correct, leads to an incorrect conclusion in Step 2.
