## Step 1: Understand the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

## 2: Derive the formula for the radius of a sphere
To find the radius \(r\) in terms of \(V\), we rearrange the formula:
\(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\)
Multiplying both sides by \(\frac{3}{4\pi}\):
\(r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\)
Taking the cube root of both sides:
\(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\)

## 3: Error Analysis for each option
A) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \): This option incorrectly rearranges the volume formula. A student might mistakenly try to solve for \(r\) by incorrectly multiplying and dividing by \(\pi\) and constants.

B) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \): This option shows a misunderstanding of how \(\pi\) and the constant \(4/3\) are used in the formula. A student might incorrectly cancel out \(\pi\) or misplace it.

C) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \): This is the correct formula for the radius of a sphere given its volume.

D) \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \): This option may result from a student incorrectly applying operations to solve for \(r\), possibly misinterpreting how to isolate \(r\) from \(r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\).

## 4: Specific errors leading to each wrong answer
A) The error is swapping the positions of \(4\pi\) and \(3\) within the cube root, likely due to a mix-up in rearranging the formula.

B) The error here involves removing \(\pi\) from the denominator, which indicates a misunderstanding of its role in the volume formula.

C) This is the correct answer, derived directly from rearranging the volume formula.

D) This option seems to result from an incorrect attempt to simplify or rearrange the formula, possibly introducing an incorrect operation or misapplying exponent rules.

## 5: Predictions
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might randomly select or choose based on minimal understanding. They might lean towards A or D due to a lack of understanding of the formula.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the basic structure of the formula but make simple algebraic mistakes, potentially leading to B or A.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the formula and are less likely to choose A, B, or D, as they can correctly derive the formula for \(r\).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students should easily identify C as the correct answer and recognize the errors leading to the other options.

## 6: Predicted Response Distribution
Given typical student performance:
- **Below_Basic**: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic**: A=25% B=25% C=40% D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might mistakenly try to solve for \(r\) by incorrectly multiplying and dividing by \(\pi\) and constants, leading to this answer.
B) A student might incorrectly cancel out \(\pi\) or misplace it in the formula.
