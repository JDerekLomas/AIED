## Step 1: Understand the question and the correct method to solve it
The question requires expanding the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\) using the distributive property (also known as FOIL for binomials), which means multiplying the First terms, then the Outer terms, then the Inner terms, and finally the Last terms, and then adding them all together.

## 2: Apply the correct method to solve the expression
Applying FOIL:
- First: \(m \times m = m^2\)
- Outer: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
- Inner: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
- Last: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)
So, \((m-5)(m-7) = m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 3: Analyze the errors for each wrong answer
Error Analysis:
A) \(m^{2}-2 m-35\): A student might incorrectly apply FOIL or distributive property, possibly calculating the middle terms as \(-7m - 5m = -2m\) instead of \(-12m\), indicating a miscalculation of the coefficients of \(m\).
B) \(m^{2}-12 m+35\): This is actually the correct answer, so students who understand and correctly apply FOIL will choose this.
C) \(m^{2}+12 m+35\): A student might incorrectly calculate the middle terms as \(-7m - 5m = +12m\) (wrongly adding the terms or misunderstanding the signs), leading to a positive coefficient for \(m\).
D) \(m^{2}-12 m-35\): A student might mistakenly subtract 35 instead of adding it, or correctly calculate \(-7m - 5m = -12m\) but then mistakenly keep the \(-35\) from possibly misinterpreting the product of \(-5\) and \(-7\) as \(-35\).

## 4: Predict the response distribution based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They are more likely to make significant errors.
  - A: Might choose A due to a simple miscalculation (20%)
  - B: Correct application is challenging for them, but let's assume a small percentage get it right by chance or simple correct calculation (10%)
  - C: Incorrectly adds the middle terms (25%)
  - D: Incorrectly handles the constant term (45%)
- **Basic**: Students have a foundational understanding but might struggle with more complex calculations.
  - A: Simple error in calculation (15%)
  - B: Understands and applies FOIL correctly (40%)
  - C: Mistake in signs or calculating the middle term (30%)
  - D: Error with constant term or signs (15%)
- **Proficient**: Students understand and can apply algebraic techniques well.
  - A: Unlikely to make simple mistakes (5%)
  - B: Correctly applies FOIL (80%)
  - C: Understands the mistake but might fall into the trap if not careful (10%)
  - D: Might occur if student forgets to change signs properly (5%)
- **Advanced**: Students have a deep understanding and rarely make mistakes.
  - A: Extremely rare (1%)
  - B: Almost always correct (90%)
  - C: Rare occurrence, mainly due to oversight (6%)
  - D: Rarely occurs, mainly from a detailed mistake (3%)

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might incorrectly apply FOIL or distributive property, possibly calculating the middle terms as \(-7m - 5m = -2m\) instead of \(-12m\).
B) This is the correct expansion.
C) A student might incorrectly calculate the middle terms as \(-7m - 5m = +12m\).
D) A student might mistakenly subtract 35 instead of adding it.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=25% D=45%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=90% C=6% D=3%
