## Error Analysis:

A) To arrive at \( +4 \), a student might incorrectly think that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result, which is correct, but they might not apply the multiplication correctly: \( -1 \times -4 = 4 \), however, some students might simply ignore the negative signs or miscalculate.

B) For \( -4 \), a student might mistakenly add the numbers instead of multiplying them: \( -1 + (-4) = -5 \) or simply not apply the correct operation, or wrongly assume one of the numbers is positive.

C) To get \( +5 \), a student may incorrectly add the numbers instead of multiplying: \( -1 + 4 = 3 \) or \( 1 + 4 = 5 \) (wrong operation and incorrect handling of signs), or misinterpret the numbers.

D) For \( -5 \), a student might mistakenly think that \( -1 \times 4 = -5 \) or \( 1 \times -4 = -5 \) (confusing the numbers and operation), or believe in an incorrect rule for multiplying negatives and positives.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students struggle with basic operations and understanding of signs. 
  - A: A significant number might choose A because they understand multiplying negatives gives a positive but not accurately apply it: 20%
  - B: Some might choose B due to basic addition/subtraction confusion: 15%
  - C: This could be chosen by those who misinterpret operations and signs significantly: 25%
  - D: Students might pick D with a hope of a negative answer but incorrect calculation: 40%

- **Basic:** Students here have foundational knowledge but may apply it clumsily.
  - A: Understanding of signs might lead some to A, fewer than below_basic: 5%
  - B: Simple arithmetic mistakes could lead to choosing B, though less likely: 5%
  - C: Mistakes in operations could still lead to C, more aware but still errors: 15%
  - D: Most are likely to calculate it somewhat correctly, leaning towards: 75%

- **Proficient:** Students have solid understanding but may slip rarely.
  - A: Rarely, due to accurate calculation and sign rules knowledge: 1%
  - B: Shouldn’t commonly make simple errors for B: 1%
  - C: Even less likely to slip into random choices like C: 2%
  - D: Reflects the question’s required skill for most accuracy in expansion rules application: 96%

- **Advanced:** Highly competent, minimal chance of mistake here due to advanced understanding and calculation check.
  - A: Possibly due to rare typos in quick calculations: <1%
  - B: Likewise very rare basic confusion slips: <1%
  - C: Extremely few might see the operations this wrong in formal checking contexts: <1%
  - D: Correct handling practically in full marks expected due thoroughness and accuracy here across assessments.

The final reformatted response following instructions.

Error Analysis:
A) A student might incorrectly apply the rules of signs or simplify wrongly not accounting numbers i..e directly obtaining +4 , presuming just the *visual logic .
B) For –ve  times – v giving *4  
C) wrong Number/ Operational Recall 
D) The effect size in the distribution  and  Misinterpr.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=15% D=75%
proficient: A=1% B=1% C=2% D=96%
advanced: A=<1% B=<1% C=<l%l D=>96%
