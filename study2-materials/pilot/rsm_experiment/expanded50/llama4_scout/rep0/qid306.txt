## Error Analysis:

A) For Problem P, the student incorrectly identifies the operation to perform first as \( 4-5 \), which actually should be evaluated from left to right since addition and subtraction have the same precedence. For Problem Q, the student incorrectly suggests \( 4+5 \) should be done first, neglecting the multiplication.

B) For Problem P, the student again correctly identifies that \( 4-5 \) should be done first because it is the first operation from the left. For Problem Q, the student recognizes \( 5 \times 6 \) should be done first, adhering to the correct order of operations (multiplication before addition).

C) For Problem P, the student suggests \( 5+6 \) should be done first, which is incorrect as per the order of operations; addition and subtraction are evaluated from left to right. For Problem Q, the student mistakes and suggests \( 4+5 \) should be done first.

D) For Problem P, the student thinks \( 5+6 \) should be performed first, which incorrectly prioritizes addition over subtraction when they have equal precedence and should be evaluated from left to right. For Problem Q, the student understands \( 5 \times 6 \) should be done first, applying the correct order of operations.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic**: These students might not fully grasp the order of operations or how to handle expressions with multiple operations. 
  - A: 20% (Misunderstanding of left-to-right for P, mistake in Q)
  - B: 5% (Almost entirely correct but not selected likely due to another error)
  - C: 30% (Doesn’t follow order of operations or precedence correctly)
  - D: 45% (Misconception on P, understands Q)

- **Basic**: These students have a basic understanding but may apply it inconsistently.
  - A: 15% 
  - B: 70% (Correct application of order of operations)
  - C: 10% (Simple operational errors)
  - D: 5% 

- **Proficient**: These students are expected to mostly get it right.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 85% 
  - C: 5% 
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are very familiar with the order of operations and nuances.
  - A: 0% 
  - B: 95%
  - C: 0% 
  - D: 5%

In reality, precise percentages are hard to predict without specific student data. But generically:

## Final Answer

Error Analysis:
A) A student here misunderstands the precedence and possibly misreads Problem Q, overlooking multiplication.
B) This student likely understands order of operations correctly or through logical mistake for P decides on correct next step considering common mathematical convention
C) Suggests misinterpretation, mistakenly adding then subtracting possibly for left- or operation not evaluated properly in combination and does mistaken add vs proper procedure 
D) Errors related mostly on misconception ordering addition over needed sub or vis versa on example on expression containing

Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=5% C=30% D=45%
