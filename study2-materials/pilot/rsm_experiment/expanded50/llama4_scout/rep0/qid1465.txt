## Error Analysis:

A) To arrive at answer A (6), a student might perform the operations in the wrong order or misunderstand the application of operations: They might do \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\) and then \(2 \times 2 = 4\) or simply add and subtract from left to right without considering the multiplication first, leading to \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 = 2\), and \(2 \times 2 = 4\). However, a more likely scenario is they do \(4 \times 2 = 8\), then \(3 - 5 = -2\), and \(-2 + 8 = 6\). This shows an understanding of multiplication before addition/subtraction but perhaps a miscalculation or incorrect operation order.

B) For answer B (4), a student might calculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\), then do \(3 - 5 = -2\), and finally \(-2 + 8 = 6\), which is actually correct, not 4. A mistake could be \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\) and then multiplying or adding 2 inappropriately, or simply evaluating as \(3 - (5 + 4) \times 2\), which would give \(3 - 9 \times 2 = 3 - 18 = -15\), close but not 4, indicating a likely miscalculation.

C) To get C (-12), a student might evaluate the expression as \(3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 = 3 - 9 \times 2 = 3 - 18 = -15\), not -12, which suggests a mistake in handling the brackets or multiplication incorrectly. A possible mistake is \(5 + 4 = 9\), \(9 \times 2 = 18\), and then \(3 - 18 = -15\). They might have intended \(-5 + 4 \times 2 = -5 + 8 = 3\) and subtracted this from 3 to get a wrong answer or mixed up operations severely.

D) For D (-10), a student might incorrectly calculate: First, \(4 \times 2 = 8\), then do \(3 - 5 = -2\), and mistakenly subtract 8, getting \(-2 - 8 = -10\). This suggests a student correctly prioritized multiplication but mistakenly applied the final operations.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, understanding of order of operations is likely weak. So, incorrect steps are common.
  - A: 30% (wrong order, simple addition/subtraction)
  - B: 15% (inappropriate mixing of operations)
  - C: 40% (misapplication of operations, perhaps using wrong numbers)
  - D: 15% (some logic but misapplying)

- **Basic:** Students have some grasp but still make significant errors.
  - A: 20% (basic addition/subtraction errors)
  - B: 10% (less understanding of operation order)
  - C: 25% (bracket or multiplication errors)
  - D: 45% (seeing multiplication effect but applying operations incorrectly)

- **Proficient:** Students generally understand order of operations but might miscalculate.
  - A: 5% (small mistake in quick mental math)
  - B: 5% (likely adding instead of etc.)
  - C: 10% (misinterpreting the expressions significantly)
  - D: 80% (mostly misapplying last steps, but understanding order)

- **Advanced:** These students are more likely to catch errors but might get careless.
  - A: 0% (Understands order, less likely to mistake multiplication effect)
  - B: 0% 
  - C: 2% (nearly always doing it right)
  - D: 98% seems too high due to errors usually fixed at this level; say they get distracted: A=2%, B=0%, C=0%, D=98%

Reassessing based on educational expectations, let's fine-tune with likely percentage allocations which typically consider standard errors at differing proficiencies:
