## Analysis of Errors:

A) Choosing A (\( \sqrt{45} \)) as not a surd: A student might mistakenly believe that because \( \sqrt{45} \) can be simplified to \( \sqrt{9 \times 5} = 3\sqrt{5} \), it cannot be a surd. However, \( 3\sqrt{5} \) is indeed a surd. The error here might be a general confusion about what constitutes a surd.

B) Choosing B (\( \sqrt{47} \)) as not a surd: A student might incorrectly assume that \( \sqrt{47} \) can be simplified into a whole number or a simple fraction because 47 is a prime number and mistakenly think prime numbers under the square root are not surds.

C) Choosing C (\( \sqrt{49} \)) as not a surd: A student would correctly identify \( \sqrt{49} = 7 \), which is a rational number and not a surd. This is actually the correct answer.

D) Choosing D (\( \sqrt{51} \)) as not a surd: A student might mistakenly believe \( \sqrt{51} \) simplifies to a rational number or incorrectly think it can be broken down further into simpler surds or rational numbers.

## Predictions:

- **below_basic:** At this level, students may not fully understand what a surd is or the conditions for a number to be considered a surd. Thus, they are more likely to choose options that look more difficult or those that they might mistakenly think cannot be simplified.
  - A: 25% (thinking it can be simplified and thus might not be a surd)
  - B: 20% (believing prime roots are not surds)
  - C: 40% (correctly or intuitively knowing this is the rational option)
  - D: 15% (misplaced guess)

- **basic:** Students at this level have a better grasp of basic mathematical concepts but might still struggle with the specifics of surds.
  - A: 20% (still confusion about simplifiable surds)
  - B: 15% (lack of understanding about prime numbers and surds)
  - C: 55% (understanding that perfect squares are not surds)
  - D: 10% (random or uninformed guess)

- **proficient:** These students have a solid understanding of mathematical concepts, including surds. They should find the question straightforward.
  - A: 5% (negligible errors due to solid understanding)
  - B: 5% (highly unlikely to confuse prime roots with non-surds)
  - C: 85% (clearly understanding \( \sqrt{49} \) is not a surd)
  - D: 5% (guessing)

- **advanced:** Students at this level have not only a deep understanding of mathematical concepts but also high confidence in their knowledge. Errors should be minimal.
  - A: 0% (unlikely to mistakenly choose A given their knowledge)
  - B: 2% (misplaced error)
  - C: 96% (correct and confident)
  - D: 2% (if considering unlikely and complex thought errors)

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$
