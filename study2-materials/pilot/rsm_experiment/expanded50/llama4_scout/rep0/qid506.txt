## Step 1: Analyze the equation given
The equation given is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\). To solve for \(p\), we need to divide both sides by 3.

## 2: Solve the equation correctly
Dividing both sides by 3 gives \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 3: Error Analysis for option A
A) To arrive at \(p = \frac{1}{4}\), a student might mistakenly multiply \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3 instead of dividing, which would give \(\frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\). This indicates a misunderstanding of the operation needed to isolate \(p\).

## 4: Error Analysis for option B
B) For \(p = \frac{1}{36}\), this is actually the correct solution, as shown in Step 2. Therefore, no error leads to this choice for students who understand the process.

## 5: Error Analysis for option C
C) To get \(p = 4\), a student might incorrectly divide 1 by 12 and then divide the result by 3, or simply misunderstand the division by 3 as multiplying by a large number. However, a more likely error is dividing 1 by 3 and then misinterpreting the result in the context of the original equation: \( \frac{1}{3} \div \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \), but the actual mistake here is not following the correct order of operations or misapplying division.

## 6: Error Analysis for option D
D) For \(p = \frac{1}{9}\), a student might incorrectly think \(3 \times \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{3}\) and then mistakenly solve for \(p\) as if the product equals \(\frac{1}{12}\) directly, not accounting for the multiplication factor correctly.
