## Step 1: Analyzing the Question
The question asks to express "\( p \) multiplied by three lots of \( q \)" in correct algebraic notation.

## 2: Understanding Algebraic Notation
The expression "\( p \) multiplied by three lots of \( q \)" translates to \( p \times 3q \) or \( 3pq \), because "three lots of \( q \)" means \( 3q \).

## 3: Error Analysis
A) \( 3 p+q \): A student might choose this by adding \( p \) multiplied by 3 to \( q \) instead of multiplying \( p \) by \( 3q \). This shows a misunderstanding of how to combine the operations.

B) \( p q^{3} \): This choice suggests a student thinks "three lots of \( q \)" means \( q \) to the power of 3, showing confusion between multiplication and exponentiation.

C) \( p q+3 \): Choosing this option implies a student thinks the expression is \( pq \) plus 3, rather than \( p \) times \( 3q \), indicating a misinterpretation of the multiplication involved.

D) \( 3 p q \): This is the correct answer, showing no error in translation.

## 4: Predicting Response Distribution
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often struggle with basic algebraic concepts. They are likely to make significant errors.
  - A: High chance because they might simply add terms without understanding multiplication.
  - B: Possible if they confuse exponentiation with multiplication.
  - C: A plausible mistake if they misinterpret the statement as adding 3 to \( pq \).
  - D: Lower chance due to the complexity of the correct operation.

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make some errors.
  - A: Moderate chance as they may not fully grasp the concept of "lots of".
  - B: Moderate chance if they get multiplication and exponentiation mixed up.
  - C: Possible, especially if they confuse the operations.
  - D: Higher chance as they understand basic multiplication.

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebra.
  - A: Lower chance as they understand basic algebraic operations.
  - B: Lower chance because they know the difference between multiplication and exponentiation.
  - C: Lower chance as they correctly interpret "multiplied by".
  - D: High chance because they accurately translate the problem.

- **Advanced**: These students have an excellent understanding and are less likely to make simple errors.
  - A, B, C: Very low chance as they clearly understand algebraic notation.
  - D: Very high chance as they accurately and quickly translate the expression.

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the analysis, let's make some educated guesses on the percentages, keeping in mind that these are rough estimates:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%
- **Basic**: A=20% B=15% C=15% D=50%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might choose this by adding \( p \) multiplied by 3 to \( q \) instead of multiplying \( p \) by \( 3q \).
B) A student thinks "three lots of \( q \)" means \( q \) to the power of 3.
C) A student thinks the expression is \( pq \) plus 3, rather than \( p \) times \( 3q \).
D) No error.
