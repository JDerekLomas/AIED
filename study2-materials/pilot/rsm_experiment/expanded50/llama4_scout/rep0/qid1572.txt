## Step 1: Understanding the Reflection Process
To reflect a point across the line \(y = -x\), we need to understand that the reflection of a point \((x, y)\) across this line results in the new point \((-y, -x)\). This is because the line \(y = -x\) acts as a mirror, swapping the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates and changing their signs.

## 2: Identifying the Coordinates of Point P
The coordinates of point \(P\) are given as \((0, 3)\).

## 3: Reflecting Point P Across the Line \(y = -x\)
Using the reflection rule across \(y = -x\), the new coordinates of \(P\) become \((-3, 0)\).

## 4: Error Analysis for Each Wrong Answer
A) To arrive at \((-6, 3)\), a student might incorrectly apply a transformation that involves multiplying or adding/subtracting a value to both coordinates or mistakenly reflect across a different axis or line.

B) For \((-3, 6)\), a student might confuse the reflection process with a rotation or another transformation, or incorrectly apply the rule for reflecting across \(y = x\) or another line.

C) For \((-3, 3)\), a student might mistakenly think that reflecting across \(y = -x\) only changes the sign of one coordinate or applies a wrong formula.

D) For \((-3, 0)\), this is actually the correct answer based on the reflection across \(y = -x\), so no error is made by choosing this option.

## 5: Specific Errors
A) A specific error could be multiplying the \(x\)-coordinate by a factor or adding/subtracting incorrectly, or misinterpreting the line of reflection.

B) A student might be confusing this with a \(90^\circ\) rotation or incorrectly applying coordinate transformations.

C) This could result from not changing the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates appropriately during reflection or misapplying a transformation rule.

## 6: Predictions
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may not fully understand coordinate geometry or reflection principles. They might randomly select an option or choose based on superficial understanding. 
  - A=30% (misinterpretation of coordinate change)
  - B=20% (confusion with other transformations)
  - C=30% (partial application of reflection)
  - D=20% (correct but might be guessed)

- **Basic**: Students have a basic understanding but may struggle with applying transformation rules accurately.
  - A=20% (simple arithmetic mistakes)
  - B=25% (mix-up with other geometric transformations)
  - C=25% (not fully applying reflection rules)
  - D=30% (correct application)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of reflection across a line but might make minor calculation errors.
  - A=10% (minor miscalculation)
  - B=15% (some confusion with other transformations)
  - C=15% (careless mistake in applying rule)
  - D=60% (correct application)

- **Advanced**: Students have a deep understanding and rarely make mistakes.
  - A=5% (very uncommon mistake)
  - B=5% (uncommon confusion)
  - C=5% (rare oversight)
  - D=85% (accurate application)

The final answer is: 

Error Analysis:
A) A student might incorrectly apply a transformation that involves multiplying or adding/subtracting a value to both coordinates or mistakenly reflect across a different axis or line.
B) A student might confuse the reflection process with a rotation or another transformation, or incorrectly apply the rule for reflecting across \(y = x\) or another line.
C) A student might mistakenly think that reflecting across \(y = -x\) only changes the sign of one coordinate or applies a wrong formula.
D) No error, as this is the correct reflection of point P across the line \(y = -x\).
