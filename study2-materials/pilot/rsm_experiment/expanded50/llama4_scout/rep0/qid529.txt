## Error Analysis:

A) To choose option A, a student might not have converted the fractions to a comparable form. They might have considered \(\frac{2}{6}\) as less than \(\frac{1}{2}\) without realizing \(\frac{2}{6}\) simplifies to \(\frac{1}{3}\), which should be compared properly to \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(\frac{3}{4}\), and \(\frac{1}{12}\).

B) For option B, a student might have directly compared the fractions without converting them to equivalent fractions or decimals, possibly misinterpreting \(\frac{2}{6}\) and \(\frac{1}{12}\) in relation to \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{3}{4}\).

C) Choosing option C indicates a student successfully converted fractions to a comparable form and ordered them correctly, as \(\frac{1}{12}\) is the smallest, followed by \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\), then \(\frac{1}{2}\), and \(\frac{3}{4}\) is the largest.

D) For option D, a student may have mistakenly ordered the fractions based on numerator or denominator size without proper conversion, e.g., considering \(\frac{1}{12}\) larger than \(\frac{2}{6}\) or misplacing \(\frac{1}{2}\).

## Predictions:

**Below Basic:** At this level, students often lack basic understanding and rely on superficial features.
- A=20% (Guessing, not converting fractions)
- B=30% (Lack of conversion; incorrectly ordering)
- C=40% (Intuitively correct or trial and error)
- D=10% (Incorrect comparison)

**Basic:** Students here have some foundational knowledge but may struggle with application.
- A=15% (Careless comparison)
- B=20% (Direct comparison mistakes)
- C=60% ( Beginning to understand fraction conversion)
- D=5% (Simple ordering errors)

**Proficient:** These students are expected to accurately compare fractions.
- A=5% (Minor oversight in comparisons)
- B=5% (Misinterpretation of fractions)
- C=80% (Accurately converted and ordered)
- D=10% (Slips in ordering)

**Advanced:** Students here are highly adept and make very few errors.
- A=0% (Rarely make such basic errors)
- B=0% (Understand comparisons well)
- C=95% (Expertise in ordering fractions)
- D=5% (Extremely rare errors)
