## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks to find the \( 3^{\text {rd }} \) digit of a \( 3 \) digit number that, when added to \( 258 \), equals \( 1162 \). The equation given is \( 258 + \square = 1162 \).

## 2: Solve for the unknown
To find the number that belongs in the box, subtract \( 258 \) from both sides of the equation: \( \square = 1162 - 258 \).

## 3: Perform the subtraction
Carrying out the subtraction: \( 1162 - 258 = 904 \).

## 4: Identify the \( 3^{\text {rd }} \) digit
The \( 3 \) digit number that belongs in the box is \( 904 \), and its \( 3^{\text {rd }} \) digit is \( 4 \).

## 5: Error Analysis for each wrong answer
A) \( 0 \): A student might choose \( 0 \) if they incorrectly solved the equation or misunderstood the concept of place value, possibly thinking the subtraction would result in a number ending in \( 0 \) or not correctly calculating it.

B) \( 2 \): Choosing \( 2 \) could indicate a miscalculation or confusion with the digits of the numbers involved, perhaps mistakenly using \( 2 \) from \( 258 \) or a wrong subtraction.

C) \( 6 \): Selecting \( 6 \) might suggest that a student incorrectly identified the digits in the calculation or performed the subtraction incorrectly, possibly getting \( 906 \) as an intermediate step.

## 6: Detailed Error Analysis
- For A) \( 0 \), a student might not have performed the subtraction correctly or might have started with an incorrect approach, like adding instead of subtracting.
- For B) \( 2 \), it could imply the student looked at the hundreds place of \( 1162 \) or \( 258 \) and thought the digit \( 2 \) was directly related to the solution without calculating.
- For C) \( 6 \), a possible mistake could involve misinterpreting the result of \( 1162 - 258 \) or incorrect handling of borrowing in subtraction.

## 7: Predictions
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic subtraction or understanding the question. They might guess or make significant errors. 
  - A=30% (guessing or incorrect subtraction), B=20% (misinterpreting numbers), C=20% (incorrect calculation), D=30% (correct calculation or insight).

- **Basic**: At this level, students can perform basic operations but might make careless mistakes.
  - A=20% (oversight in calculation), B=15% (confusion with digits), C=15% (simple arithmetic mistake), D=50% (correct understanding and calculation).

- **Proficient**: These students understand the operations but might make minor errors.
  - A=5% (careless mistake), B=5% (small error in calculation), C=5% (minor mistake), D=85% (accurate calculation).

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of concepts and can apply them accurately.
  - A=0% (unlikely to make such a basic error), B=0% (understands the concept), C=0% (knows how to calculate accurately), D=100% (strong understanding and accurate calculation).

## 8: Refining Predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=40%, B=25%, C=25%, D=10%
- **Basic**: A=25%, B=20%, C=20%, D=35%
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=10%, D=80%
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might not have performed the subtraction correctly or might have started with an incorrect approach.
B) Choosing \( 2 \) could indicate a miscalculation or confusion with the digits of the numbers involved.
C) Selecting \( 6 \) might suggest that a student incorrectly identified the digits in the calculation or performed the subtraction incorrectly.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=20% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
