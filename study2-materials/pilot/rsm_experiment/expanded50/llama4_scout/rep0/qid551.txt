## Error Analysis:
A) A student choosing A (Only Jo) might be misreading the protractor or not understanding that the marked angle is not the one directly measured by the protractor. If the protractor shows 240 degrees, the marked angle could be misunderstood as 120 degrees if the student mistakenly thinks the protractor directly gives the angle measure without considering the reflex angle.

B) A student choosing B (Only Paul) might correctly identify that the angle shown on the protractor is 240 degrees but then mistakenly believes the marked angle is 60 degrees. This could happen if the student subtracts 240 from 360 (to get the acute angle) but then incorrectly states Paul's claim without verifying it against the protractor or geometric principles.

C) A student choosing C (Both Jo and Paul) would likely have a significant misunderstanding of basic angle measurements. This could occur if a student incorrectly believes that both a 120-degree angle and a 60-degree angle could be correct based on the protractor reading, possibly thinking the protractor's 240 degrees validates both claims directly.

D) A student choosing D (Neither is correct) might understand that one of the angle measurements given by Jo or Paul is incorrect but fails to accurately measure or calculate the marked angle. This choice could result from a correct identification that the protractor measures 240 degrees, indicating the reflex angle, but then mistakenly concluding neither Jo nor Paul is correct without properly calculating the acute angle.

## Predictions:
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with reading the protractor and understanding angle measurements.
  - A = 30% (misreading the protractor)
  - B = 25% (incorrect subtraction or misunderstanding)
  - C = 20% (confusion about angles)
  - D = 25% (giving up or incorrect calculation)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple errors.
  - A = 15% (occasional misreading)
  - B = 20% (straightforward miscalculation)
  - C = 10% (holding two incorrect views)
  - D = 55% (recognizing an error but not correcting it)

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts but might have moments of inattention.
  - A = 5% (rare misreading)
  - B = 5% (simple mistake)
  - C = 5% (unlikely to hold both incorrect views)
  - D = 85% (accurately identifies the mistake)

- **Advanced:** Advanced students are expected to have a strong grasp of the concepts.
  - A = 0% (unlikely to misread significantly)
  - B = 0% (unlikely to make a straightforward mistake)
  - C = 0% (highly unlikely)
  - D = 100% (or very close, accurately concluding neither is correct based on protractor reading)
