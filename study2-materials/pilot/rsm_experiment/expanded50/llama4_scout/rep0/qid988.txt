## Step 1: Understand the question and the task
The task is to analyze a multiple-choice question about sharing an amount of money (£360) in a given ratio (2:7) and to predict the percentage of students at different ability levels who would choose each incorrect option.

## 2: Solve the problem to find the correct answer
First, we find the total parts in the ratio: 2 + 7 = 9 parts.
Then, we divide £360 by 9 to find the value of each part: £360 / 9 = £40.
So, the shares are 2 parts * £40 = £80 and 7 parts * £40 = £280.
The correct answer is D) £80: £280.

## 3: Analyze the errors for each wrong answer
A) £60: £300
- Error: A student might incorrectly calculate the total parts or the value of each part. For example, dividing £360 by a wrong number of parts or not using the ratio correctly.

B) £180: £51 (or £180: £180 if considering a mistaken calculation like 360/2)
- Error: Incorrectly applying the ratio. For instance, taking 2/9 * 360 = £80 but mistakenly calculating or using a wrong method for the second part.

C) £100: £160
- Error: Misinterpreting the ratio or incorrectly dividing the total amount. For example, not using the ratio 2:7 properly or making a calculation mistake.

## 4: Specific error analysis
A) To get £60: £300, a student might divide 360 by a mistaken total or use incorrect proportions: (2/9)*360 = 80, not 60; (7/9)*360 = 280, not 300. This suggests an incorrect calculation, possibly adding or subtracting wrongly.

B) For £180: £51 (mistakenly could be £180:£180 for an equal split misunderstanding), they might add 2+7=9, then 360/9=40, 2*40=80; but incorrectly find 180 as one share or split equally.

C) £100: £160 might come from an equal split mistake (360/2 = 180), not using the 2:7 ratio, indicating confusion about ratios.

## 5: Predictions
Given typical student understanding:
- **Below Basic**: These students would likely struggle to apply ratios correctly. They might opt for A or C due to oversimplification (A=30%, B=20%, C=30%, D=20%).
- **Basic**: Students at this level should have a basic grasp of ratios but may still make errors due to carelessness. They'd be more inclined towards A and C, given simple calculation mistakes (A=25%, B=15%, C=25%, D=35%).
- **Proficient**: These students understand ratios well but could mistakenly choose A due to minor calculation errors; B becomes unlikely due to a clear understanding of proportion (A=15%, B=5%, C=10%, D=70%).
- **Advanced**: Only very simple errors would occur here; nearly all would select D, given confidence in ratio calculations; any error tends towards A through minor fraction/priority mix-ups (A=5%, B=0%, C=5%, D=90%).

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might divide £360 into parts incorrectly or miscalculate the share values, leading to  £60 for 2 parts and £300 for 7 parts, possibly by incorrect division or multiplication.
B) Incorrect calculation or misunderstanding of ratio application, potentially simplifying to an equal or wrong distribution.
C) Misinterpretation of the ratio, equally splitting, or incorrect parts calculation.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=25% D=35%
proficient: A=15% B=5% C=10% D=70%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=5% D=90%
