## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the task
The equation given is \( y = 2^x \), and we need to find the value of \( y \) when \( x = -5 \).

## 2: Calculate the correct value of \( y \) for \( x = -5 \)
To find \( y \) when \( x = -5 \), we substitute \( x \) in the equation: \( y = 2^{-5} \). Recall that \( 2^{-n} = \frac{1}{2^n} \), so \( 2^{-5} = \frac{1}{2^5} = \frac{1}{32} \).

## 3: Analyze the errors leading to each wrong answer
A) \( -32 \): A student might mistakenly think that \( 2^{-5} \) is the same as \( -2^5 \) or simply misunderstand the concept of negative exponents, leading to a wrong calculation.
B) \( -\frac{1}{32} \): This could result from a student mistakenly applying a negative sign to the fraction, possibly due to confusion with negative exponents or incorrect handling of the equation.
C) \( -10 \): This might come from a calculation error where a student incorrectly applies exponent rules or mistakenly calculates \( 2^5 = 32 \) and then incorrectly adjusts for the negative exponent.
D) \( \frac{1}{32} \): This is the correct answer, as calculated in Step 2.

## 4: Detailed error analysis for each option
A) A student choosing A might confuse \( 2^{-5} \) with \( -2^5 \), not understanding that a negative exponent indicates a reciprocal, not a negative number.
B) For B, a student may correctly calculate \( 2^{-5} = \frac{1}{2^5} = \frac{1}{32} \) but then incorrectly add a negative sign.
C) Choosing C, \( -10 \), suggests a significant misunderstanding, possibly calculating \( 2^{-5} \) as \( -2^{-5} \) or completely misinterpreting the exponent.
D) This is the correct calculation: \( 2^{-5} = \frac{1}{32} \), demonstrating understanding of negative exponents.

## 5: Predict the response distribution based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle significantly with exponent rules. They might choose A or C due to a lack of understanding of negative exponents or basic calculations. B and D require some level of understanding of fractions and exponents.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with applying rules correctly, possibly leading to choices A, B, or C due to minor calculation errors or misunderstanding of negative exponents.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand exponents but might still make simple mistakes. They are less likely to choose A or C but could choose B if they misinterpret the negative sign.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of the material and are less likely to make errors, with most choosing D.

## 6: Quantitative Predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student misunderstandings:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (confusing with positive exponent), B=20% (adding wrong sign), C=30% (completely off), D=10% (correct calculation).
- **Basic**: A=25%, B=25%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=15%, C=5%, D=70%.
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=5%, C=0%, D=90%.

The best answer is D.
