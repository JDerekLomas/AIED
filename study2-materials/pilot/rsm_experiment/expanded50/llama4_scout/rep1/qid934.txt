## Step 1: Understand the given problem and the equation
The equation given is \(4x + 2y = 10\). We need to find the value of \(y\) (denoted by \(\color{gold}\bigstar\)) when \(x = 0\).

## 2: Solve the equation for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation:
\(4(0) + 2y = 10\)
\(0 + 2y = 10\)
\(2y = 10\)
\(y = 5\)

## 3: Analyze the errors for each wrong answer
A) To arrive at \(20\), a student might incorrectly substitute \(x = 0\) and then solve for \(y\) as \(4(0) + 2y = 10\) becomes \(2y = 10 \times 4 = 40\) (incorrectly multiplying 10 by 4), leading to \(y = 20\).

B) For \(3\), a student might solve \(4x + 2y = 10\) for \(y\) when \(x = 1\), not \(x = 0\), getting \(4(1) + 2y = 10\) or \(2y = 6\), hence \(y = 3\).

C) To get \(5\), a student correctly solves for \(y\) when \(x = 0\), as done in step 2.

D) For \(2.5\), a student might divide the constant term by 2 directly without properly substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, or incorrectly solve \(2y = 10\) as \(y = 10 / 4 = 2.5\).

## 4: Detailed error analysis
A) A student choosing A likely misunderstood the substitution process or multiplied the wrong part of the equation.

B) A student choosing B might have substituted the wrong value of \(x\) or made a calculation mistake.

C) A student choosing C correctly substituted \(x = 0\) and solved for \(y\).

D) A student choosing D may have confused the coefficients or incorrectly divided.

## 5: Predict the response distribution based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand how to substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation or solve for \(y\). They might randomly choose or make basic calculation errors. Expect a high likelihood of choosing A or D due to confusion.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the concept of substitution but could make computational errors. They might choose B or A due to simple mistakes.
- **Proficient**: Students who are proficient should easily solve for \(y\) and choose C. However, some might choose D due to slight confusion with coefficients.
- **Advanced**: These students should all choose C with no errors.

## 6: Quantitative Predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (gross mistake), B=20% (wrong substitution), C=20% (correct but rare), D=30% (division mistake)
- **Basic**: A=15% (careless error), B=25% (substitution mistake), C=50% (correct), D=10% (minor confusion)
- **Proficient**: A=5% (unusual mistake), B=10% (rare substitution error), C=80% (correct), D=5% (minor error)
- **Advanced**: A=0% (no gross errors), B=0% (understands substitution), C=100% (correct with certainty), D=0% (no confusion)

The best answer is C.
