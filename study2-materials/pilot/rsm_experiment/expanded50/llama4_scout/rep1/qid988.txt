## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires sharing \( £360 \) in the ratio \( 2:7 \). This means the total parts are \( 2 + 7 = 9 \) parts. Each part is worth \( \frac{£360}{9} = £40 \).

## 2: Calculating the Shares
To find the shares, we multiply each part of the ratio by the value of one part:
- The first share is \( 2 \times £40 = £80 \).
- The second share is \( 7 \times £40 = £280 \).

## 3: Error Analysis
A) \( £60: £300 \) - This would be a result of miscalculating the value of one part or not using the ratio correctly. For example, if a student mistakenly thought the total parts were 6 (2+4), they'd calculate incorrectly.

B) \( £180: £51 \) - This seems to result from a random or incorrect calculation, possibly confusing the ratio with a different operation or misinterpreting the distribution.

C) \( £100: £160 \) - This could result from adding the parts of the ratio (2+7=9) and then mistakenly dividing \( £360 \) by a wrong number or directly dividing without properly using the ratio.

D) \( £80: £280 \) - This is the correct calculation based on the given ratio.

## 4: Specific Errors
A) A student might incorrectly calculate the parts or mistakenly divide the total amount without properly considering the ratio, leading to \( £60 \) for 2 parts and \( £300 \) for 7 parts.

B) A significant miscalculation or incorrect application of ratio, possibly mistakenly using 1 part as \( £180 / 2 = £90 \) and then not properly scaling.

C) Miscalculation where the total is divided incorrectly or the ratio parts are misinterpreted.

## 5: Predictions
- **Below Basic:** A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10% (Many errors, with a high chance of random or basic calculation mistakes)
- **Basic:** A=20% B=30% C=25% D=25% (Some understanding but prone to calculation errors)
- **Proficient:** A=10% B=15% C=10% D=65% (Good understanding, fewer errors)
- **Advanced:** A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85% (High understanding, very few errors)

## Error Analysis:
A) Incorrectly calculating the share values, possibly misunderstanding the division of the total amount into parts or miscalculating the value per part.
B) A significant calculation mistake or not following the ratio properly, possibly indicating confusion with other mathematical operations.
C) Misinterpretation of how to apply the ratio to the total amount, possibly calculating with incorrect factors.
D) Correct application of the ratio.
