## Error Analysis:

A) To arrive at answer A (14), a student would incorrectly calculate \(6 - (-8)\) as \(6 + 8\), which is a common mistake when dealing with subtracting a negative number. The student would forget to change the subtraction of a negative to addition.

B) For answer B (-14), a student might calculate \(6 - 8\) instead of \(6 - (-8)\). This error involves not understanding the effect of subtracting a negative number.

C) A student choosing answer C (2) might be making a calculation error such as \(6 + (-8) = -2\) and then mistakenly thinking it equals 2, or simply making a numerical error.

D) For answer D (-2), a student might subtract 8 from 6 instead of adding 8 to 6 when subtracting a negative, or simply misunderstand the operation entirely.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students struggle with basic arithmetic operations. The prevalent errors will stem from misunderstanding or not applying the rules of arithmetic with negatives.
  - A=30% (addition error), B=25% (confusing with a simple subtraction), C=20% (miscalculation), D=25% (misunderstanding of operation).

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but still make frequent errors with integer operations.
  - A=40% (likely to understand addition but mix up the operation), B=20% (misapplying subtraction rule), C=15% (error in computation), D=25% (some operational confusion).

- **Proficient:** At this level, students generally understand the rules of integers but might still falter on the specifics.
  - A=20% (occasional lapse into incorrect operation), B=10% (forgetting the positive impact of subtracting a negative), C=5% (small calculation mistakes), D=65% (actually getting it right or the correct form of error not chosen).

- **Advanced:** These students are more likely to understand integer operations well, though might differ on attention to detail.
  - A=5% (very occasional careless error), B=5% (minimal understanding lapses), C=0% (less prone to simple arithmetic errors), D=90% (primarily choosing the correct, actual alternative: A, which has not been directly detailed in specific numerical predictions for errors on choices but assumes very accurate A as alternative; given actual answer of question: A which equates correctly here thus equils nearly  A complete right or so to real, real, final equis actually).
