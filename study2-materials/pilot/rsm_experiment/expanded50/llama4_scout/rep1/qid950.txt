## Error Analysis:

A) To choose A as not a surd, a student might mistakenly think that \(\sqrt{45}\) can be simplified into a whole number or a simple fraction, possibly confusing it with \(\sqrt{36}\) or \(\sqrt{25}\), or they might not fully understand what constitutes a surd.

B) To choose B as not a surd, a student would likely have a misconception about \(\sqrt{47}\) not being a surd, possibly because they are not aware that 47 is a prime number and does not have a perfect square factor other than 1, implying \(\sqrt{47}\) is indeed a surd.

C) To choose C as not a surd, a student recognizes that \(\sqrt{49} = 7\), which is a whole number. This indicates an understanding that a surd cannot be simplified into a rational number (or a whole number), but choosing C as the answer signifies a correct identification of a non-surd.

D) To choose D as not a surd, a student might believe \(\sqrt{51}\) can be simplified, similar to the error for A, or they misunderstand the definition of a surd. However, this would not directly relate to a conceptual error without more context but indicates confusion.

## Predictions:

- A student below basic might not understand what a surd is and could pick any option based on incorrect reasoning or randomly.
- A basic student would likely still struggle with understanding surds but might recognize C.
- A proficient student would understand surds but could make simple mistakes.
- An advanced student would clearly understand what a surd is.

## Precise Predictions:

**Below Basic:**
Without a deep understanding, choices might seem random or based on superficial understanding:
- A: 20% (random guess)
- B: 20% (not recognizing 47 as prime or a surd)
- C: 30% (some might realize 49 is a square)
- D: 30% (similar confusion as A)

**Basic:**
Some understanding but likely errors:
- A: 25% (mistaking \(\sqrt{45}\) for a non-surd)
- B: 15% (not sure about \(\sqrt{47}\))
- C: 50% (recognizes 49 as a square of 7)
- D: 10% (less likely to confuse)

**Proficient:**
Good grasp but could overlook simple squares:
- A: 5% (recognize \(\sqrt{45}\) as \(3\sqrt{5}\), a surd)
- B: 5% (know \(\sqrt{47}\) is a surd)
- C: 85% (correctly identify \(\sqrt{49} = 7\), not a surd)
- D: 5% (know \(\sqrt{51}\) is a surd)

**Advanced:**
High understanding, fewer errors:
- A: 0% (know \(\sqrt{45}\) is a surd)
- B: 0% (know \(\sqrt{47}\) is a surd)
- C: 100% (correct; 7 is not a surd)
- D: 0% (know \(\sqrt{51}\) is a surd)

The final refined response according to requested format:

## Error Analysis:
A) A student might choose A thinking \(\sqrt{45}\) could simplify in a way that makes it not a surd or due to lack of understanding about prime factors and squares.
B) Mistaking \(\sqrt{47}\) for not being a surd likely indicates not recognizing 47's primality and the definition of a surd.
C) Choosing C as the answer shows understanding since \(\sqrt{49} = 7\), a whole number.
D) Not applicable as D represents recognizing \(\sqrt{51}\) as a surd.

## Predictions:
below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
