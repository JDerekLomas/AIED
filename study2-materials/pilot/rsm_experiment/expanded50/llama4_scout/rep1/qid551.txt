## Error Analysis:

A) Only Jo: A student might choose this option if they incorrectly read the protractor or misunderstood the position of the angle. However, a more likely reason is that the student sees the protractor measuring 120 degrees from one side and mistakenly believes that's the angle in question without considering the full context or the actual angle marked.

B) Only Paul: This choice could arise if a student mistakenly believes the angle is acute (less than 90 degrees) because it appears smaller without using the protractor for measurement. Alternatively, if a student incorrectly reads the protractor, thinking the marked angle is 60 degrees directly.

C) Both Jo and Paul: A student might choose this if they mistakenly believe that both measurements (120 degrees and 60 degrees) are valid for the same angle, possibly confusing supplementary and complementary angles or misinterpreting the protractor readings.

D) Neither is correct: A student might select this if they recognize that one of the measurements must be incorrect but are unsure which one. Alternatively, they might misread the protractor significantly and believe neither Jo nor Paul's measurement matches.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students may struggle with reading measurements or understanding angles.
  - A=30% (misreading or direct acceptance of given statement)
  - B=25% (simple misreading or lack of understanding)
  - C=20% (confusion between measurements or supplementary angles)
  - D=25% (completely unsure or significant misreading)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have foundational knowledge but may still make simple errors.
  - A=15% (some understanding but misapply it)
  - B=20% (misreading, but more likely to consider the visual aspect)
  - C=10% (less confusion about basic properties)
  - D=55% (recognize error in both but confusion on the correct answer)

- **Proficient:** These students have a good grasp of geometric concepts and are less likely to make basic errors.
  - A=5% (close but misinterprets slightly)
  - B=5% (basic misreading)
  - C=5% (uncommon but possible confusion)
  - D=85% (understand that if one is right, the other must be wrong based on measurements)

- **Advanced:** Students here have excellent understanding and are precise in their measurements and calculations.
  - A=0% (high accuracy in interpreting measurements)
  - B=0% (precise in angle measurement understanding)
  - C=0% (understand supplementary nature or directly measure accurately)
  - D=100% (know that with a protractor showing 240 degrees for the full angle, it's supplementary and thus one person's claim is directly derived from accurately reading the protractor shown as 60 degrees for the angle in question, leading to clear identification.)

The best answer is B.
