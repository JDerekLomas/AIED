## Step 1: Understanding the Reflection Across the Line y = -x
To reflect a point across the line \(y = -x\), we need to understand that the reflection of a point \((x, y)\) across the line \(y = -x\) results in the new point \((-y, -x)\). This is because the line \(y = -x\) acts as a mirror, swapping the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates and changing their signs.

## 2: Error Analysis for Option A
Option A: \( (-6, 3) \)
A student choosing option A might be incorrectly applying a transformation or misunderstanding the coordinates of point P. If a student mistakenly thought the reflection across \(y = -x\) would simply change the sign of the x-coordinate (but not swap or change the sign of \(y\)), they might arrive at \((-0, 3)\) or \((0,3)\) which is the original point, not \((-6,3)\). However, an error in coordinate transformation, such as mistakenly multiplying or adding instead of swapping and negating, could result in such an answer. For example, a mistaken operation like \((-x \times 2, y)\) for point \((0,3)\) gives \((-6,3)\).

## 3: Error Analysis for Option B
Option B: \( (-3, 6) \)
For a student to choose option B, \( (-3, 6) \), they could mistakenly think that the reflection involves changing the sign of one coordinate and then adjusting the other in some arbitrary way. A more likely error could involve confusion with a 90-degree rotation rather than a reflection. The point \((0,3)\) reflected across \(y=-x\) actually becomes \((-3,0)\), not \((-3,6)\). An error might involve swapping the coordinates but then mistakenly multiplying or adding a value.

## 4: Error Analysis for Option C
Option C: \( (-3, 3) \)
A student might choose option C, \( (-3, 3) \), by assuming that the reflection across \(y = -x\) only changes the sign of \(x\) (or \(y\)), not swapping them. For the point \((0,3)\), changing the sign of \(x \) (initially 0) keeps it 0, and the \(y\)-coordinate remains 3; though the mistake seems minimal, any confusion reflecting across axes versus lines like \(y=-x\) can lead here.

## 5: Error Analysis for Option D
Option D: \( (-3, 0) \)
The point \((0,3)\) reflected across \(y=-x\) actually moves to \((-3,0)\) because we swap the \(x\) and \(y\) and change their signs: \((-3, -0)\) is \((0,3)\)’s reflection which simplifies to \((-3,0)\). This matches the correct process, suggesting a deeper understanding or possibly less calculation error.

## 6: Predictions Based on Student Ability Levels
The percentage of students choosing each option would likely vary based on their mathematical proficiency. Students who misunderstand transformations or incorrectly apply rules are more likely to select incorrect options.

- **Below Basic:** At this level, conceptual understanding and application of mathematical transformations might be lacking. A higher percentage might choose **A** (due to misapplication of operations such as negation or scalar multiplication), **B** (misconceptions about transformations leading to arbitrary changes), **C** (partial understanding or operation like only handling \(x=0\)).
- **Basic:** Students here might demonstrate a little more knowledge. **C** could attract some as they might not fully grasp or apply coordinate swaps with reflections.
- **Proficient:** These students have solid foundational skills and a good grasp of concepts. Incorrect choices here could often stem from careful calculation errors.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students, already confident with concepts, may see low numbers choosing incorrect options.

## 7: Quantitative Predictions of Response Distribution
Given typical error progression and decreasing mistakes as student skill levels rise:

**Error Predictions**
A) Incorrect use of transformations.
B) Incorrect rotation/reflection mix-up.
C) Misapplication or underapplication of transformation rules (changing 1 coordinate).
D) Correct transformation across \(y=-x\).
