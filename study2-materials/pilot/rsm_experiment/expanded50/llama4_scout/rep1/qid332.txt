## Error Analysis:

A) Only Tom: A student might choose this option if they understand Tom's step is correct but fail to verify Katie's step, or if they incorrectly verify Katie's step as wrong.

B) Only Katie: This choice might be selected by a student who understands Katie's step but not Tom's, or if they verify Tom's step as incorrect.

C) Both Tom and Katie: A student choosing this option believes both steps are correct. This requires understanding the algebraic manipulation but perhaps not checking for validity or not fully comprehending Katie's proposed step.

D) Neither is correct: This option might be chosen by a student who realizes both proposed steps are incorrect according to algebraic rules.

## Specific Errors:

- For A: A student might verify Tom's step correctly (adding 5 to both sides results in \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \)) but either doesn't attempt to verify Katie's or verifies it incorrectly.
- For B: A student who checks Katie's step properly (multiplying everything by 3 yields \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \)) but incorrectly assesses Tom's.
- For C: The student who believes adding 5 to both sides yields \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \) (correct) and also incorrectly thinks \( x - 5 = 36 \) is equivalent to \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) (wrong).
- For D: A student who checks both steps: adding 5 to both sides of the equation \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) gives \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \), which is Tom's step; but for Katie's, multiplying by 3 gives \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \), making Katie's step incorrect. Correct understanding indicates only Tom's step is correct.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** A=30% (overconfidence in incorrect method), B=20% (isolated understanding of Katie's incorrect method), C=10% (confusion), D=40% (total confusion, might select an answer they feel is wrong based on incorrect premise).
- **Basic:** A=40% (knows some algebraic rules but misapprehends Katie's), B=25% (partly understands but wrong on Katie), C=20% (some knowledge but can't apply fully), D=15% (starts to evaluate options critically).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (realizes Tom's step but perhaps still confounded by Katie), B=5% (knows steps; likely to see flaw), C=80% (verifies step validity correctly), D=10% (almost fully understands; critical checking would rule out wrong).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (full understanding; Tom's verified), B=0% (misunderstands principles very little; sees through to validity; understands \( X -15 =36 \) Katie's is wrong, by substitution check), C=95% (expert understanding; verification aligns Tom accurately verified, understands fallacy), D=5% (edge cases or checking oversight misjudges principles slightly if initially;).

Thus formulated responses to error specifics lead to this estimation regarding students likely pick rates per performance measure taken presumably across test cohorts assessing foundational problemsolving math strategies:

Error Analysis:
A) The student considers the mathematical effect accurately put but might lack evaluation or mistaken identification for Kattie's formulation
B) Could potentially choose given formulation but evaluation Katie does flawed premise application not accounting multiplication result

The final answer is: 

Error Analysis:
A) A student might choose this if they accept Tom's step but incorrectly invalidate Katie's
B) A student might think Katie right & Tom evaluated disapproved
C) Understanding steps validates if right premise effect understanding thus validation
