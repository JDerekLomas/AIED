## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the correct solution.
To find the 3-digit number that belongs in the box, we need to solve the equation \(258 + \square = 1162\). Subtracting 258 from both sides gives \(\square = 1162 - 258 = 904\). Thus, the 3-digit number is 904, and its 3rd digit is 4.

## 2: Analyze the error for each wrong answer.
A) To choose A (0), a student might subtract 258 from 1162 but incorrectly calculate or not realize they need the third digit of the result. The correct calculation yields 904, and if a student mistakenly looks at the first or second digit or makes a calculation error leading to a number ending in 0, they might choose 0.

B) To choose B (2), a student could misinterpret the calculation or mistake the digits. For example, if they thought \(1162 - 258 = 902\) but then incorrectly identified the third digit or made a calculation mistake.

C) To choose C (6), a student might mistakenly use the digit from the hundreds place of 1162 or 258 directly or after a wrong calculation. For instance, adding or subtracting incorrectly and focusing on the resulting hundreds digit.

D) To choose D (4), this is the correct answer based on our calculation (\(\square = 904\), and the 3rd digit of 904 is 4).

## 3: Detailed error analysis for each option.
A) A student choosing A might not perform the subtraction correctly or might ignore the actual calculation and guess or misunderstand the place value.

B) For B (2), an error could be in calculating \(1162 - 258\) to get 902 but then misreading or miscalculating further.

C) For C (6), it could be that a student adds 258 and another number close to but not exactly 904, ending in a digit that seems plausible or mistakenly taking a digit directly from one of the numbers given.

## 4: Predict the response distribution based on student ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may not understand the concept of place value or how to perform subtraction with large numbers. They might guess or choose an answer based on incorrect calculations or misunderstandings. 
  - A: 30% (students might think the third digit could be 0 without calculation)
  - B: 20% (miscalculation or incorrect digit recall)
  - C: 30% (seeing 1162 and thinking of its digits)
  - D: 20% (possibly understand the subtraction but miscalculate)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but may struggle with multi-digit calculations or checking their work.
  - A: 15% (simple errors or misreading)
  - B: 15% (similar errors as below basic but slightly more calculated guesses)
  - C: 20% (focus on one part of the calculation)
  - D: 50% (correct calculation or using logic to deduce)

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts but might make calculation mistakes under pressure.
  - A: 5% (minor errors or oversight)
  - B: 5% (similar minor errors)
  - C: 10% (focusing on wrong aspects of numbers)
  - D: 80% (accurate calculation)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to have strong calculation skills and understanding of mathematical concepts.
  - A: 1% (unlikely errors)
  - B: 1% (very rare errors)
  - C: 2% (minimal chance of mistake)
  - D: 96% (accurate calculations and understanding)

The final answer is: 

Error Analysis:
A) A student might not perform the subtraction correctly or ignore the actual calculation.
B) A student could misinterpret the calculation or mistake the digits.
C) A student might mistakenly use the digit from the hundreds place or after a wrong calculation.
D) No error, as 904 is the correct number and its 3rd digit is 4.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=20% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=2% D=96%
