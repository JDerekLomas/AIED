## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks Ada turns clockwise from facing Northwest (NW) to facing South (S) and to determine how many degrees she has turned.

## 2: Identifying Key Directions and Their Angles
- Northwest (NW) is at 315 degrees on a compass.
- South (S) is at 180 degrees on a compass.

## 3: Calculating the Turn Angle
To find out how many degrees Ada has turned, we subtract the initial direction from the final direction. Since Ada turns clockwise, we calculate the difference as follows:
\[ 315^\circ - 180^\circ = 135^\circ \]

## 4: Error Analysis for Each Wrong Answer
A) \( 225^{\degree} \): This would involve incorrectly calculating the turn or misunderstanding the directions. A possible error is adding instead of subtracting or misinterpreting the compass directions.
B) \( 315^{\degree} \): This answer suggests Ada didn't turn at all or turned a full circle and then some, which indicates a misunderstanding of the initial and final positions or the direction of turn.
C) \( 135^{\degree} \): This is actually the correct answer, so it wouldn't be considered an error but rather the correct calculation.
D) \( 180^{\degree} \): This implies turning to directly face south from northwest as turning half a circle, which might stem from oversimplifying or not accurately using compass directions.

## 5: Detailed Error Analysis
A) A student choosing A might think they need to turn from NW to SE or another misinterpretation, suggesting a lack of understanding of directional changes.
B) A student choosing B might believe turning from NW to S involves a full circle (360 degrees) minus the 45 degrees difference between NW and N (or similar miscalculation), showing confusion with circular motion or directional changes.
C) Correct answer, no error.
D) A student might choose D by seeing NW and S as directly opposed in a simplistic view (e.g., north-south line), not accurately accounting for the NW starting position.

## 6: Predict Response Distribution
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle with compass directions and degrees. Expect high rates of error.
  - A: 20% (misunderstanding of full circle)
  - B: 30% (incorrectly thinking she faces the opposite direction or turns full circle)
  - C: 10% (some might understand basic turns but not degrees)
  - D: 40% (half circle simplification)

- **Basic**: These students have a grasp of basics but may struggle with specific angles.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 20%
  - C: 60% (grasp of 135-degree turn)
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient**: Students who understand compass directions and can calculate turns.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 85%
  - D: 5%

## 7: Writing Predictions in Requested Format
Error Analysis:
A) A student might add or incorrectly calculate the degrees for the turn, resulting in 225 degrees.
B) A student might think Ada ends up facing the wrong direction or miscalculate the turn angle.
C) No error; correct calculation.
D) A student simplifies to a 180-degree turn.
