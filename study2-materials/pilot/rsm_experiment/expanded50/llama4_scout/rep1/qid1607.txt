## Step 1: Analyzing the given equation and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \( k \), we first multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which yields \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \), simplifying to \( 60 = 1 + k \). Then, we subtract 1 from both sides to solve for \( k \), resulting in \( k = 60 - 1 = 59 \). Isaac's steps are:
Step \( 1: 60 = 1 + k \), which is correct based on the multiplication of both sides by 4.
Step \( 2: 61 = k \), which is incorrect because it mistakenly adds 1 to both sides instead of subtracting 1 from 60.

## 2: Error Analysis for each option
A) Only step \( 1 \) is correct: A student choosing this option acknowledges that Step 1 is correct but does not proceed to verify Step 2, possibly due to not checking the subsequent steps or not solving for \( k \) themselves.
B) Only Step \( 2 \) is correct: This would imply that the student thinks subtracting 1 from both sides of \( 60 = 1 + k \) yields 61, which is a clear arithmetic mistake.
C) Both steps are correct: This suggests a student who does not recognize the error in Step 2, possibly due to not understanding the algebraic manipulation or not checking the solution.
D) Both steps are incorrect: A student choosing this option would need to recognize that while Step 1 is correct, Step 2 is not, which indicates an understanding of the algebraic process but also an ability to critically evaluate Isaac's work.

## 3: Specific errors leading to each wrong answer
A) A student chooses A if they see Step 1 as correct but either don't evaluate Step 2 or see its error, suggesting some algebraic understanding but a lack of completion.
B) A student chooses B if they incorrectly validate Step 2, showing a misunderstanding of basic algebraic operations.
C) A student chooses C if they fail to notice the mistake in Step 2, indicating a lack of attention to detail or understanding of algebraic manipulations.
D) A student chooses D if they understand that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is wrong, showing an ability to critically assess the steps.

## 4: Predictions based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulations. They might randomly select or choose based on superficial understanding.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may make simple arithmetic or conceptual mistakes.
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebraic concepts and can apply them but might still make occasional errors in complex problems.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and can critically evaluate given solutions.

## 5: Detailed Predictions
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (some understanding of initial steps), B=20% (simple error), C=20% (lack of understanding), D=30% (general dissatisfaction with steps).
- **Basic**: A=40% (recognize first step), B=15% (misunderstand subtraction), C=10% (don't check second step), D=35% (critical thinking).
- **Proficient**: A=20% (partly correct), B=5% (clear mistake), C=5% (critical evaluation failure), D=70% (strong understanding and critical thinking).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (very superficial), B=0% (unlikely to mistakenly validate incorrect step), C=0% (would notice the error), D=95% (high level of critical thinking).

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student chooses A if they see Step 1 as correct but do not verify or agree with Step 2.
B) A student chooses B if they incorrectly think Step 2 is right, mistakenly believing \( k = 61 \).
C) A student chooses C if they incorrectly validate both steps as correct, not noticing \( k = 59 \), not \( 61 \).
D) A student chooses D if they recognize both steps' validity or lack thereof, correctly identifying Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect.

Predictions:
