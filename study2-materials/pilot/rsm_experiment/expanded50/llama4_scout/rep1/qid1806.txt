## Error Analysis:
A) A student might choose this option if they misunderstand "three lots of \( q \)" to mean adding \( q \) three times to \( p \), rather than multiplying \( p \) by the result of adding \( q \) to itself three times or simply multiplying \( p \) by \( 3q \). This shows a lack of understanding of the phrase "three lots of" in a multiplicative context.

B) A student might choose this option if they misinterpret "three lots of \( q \)" as \( q \) raised to the power of 3 and then multiplied by \( p \), confusing the meaning of "lots" with exponentiation.

C) A student might choose this option if they understand "three lots of \( q \)" as \( 3q \) but then mistakenly add \( p \) and \( q \) instead of multiplying \( p \) by \( 3q \).

D) This is the correct answer. A student who chooses this option understands that "three lots of \( q \)" translates to \( 3q \) and then correctly multiplies \( p \) by \( 3q \) to get \( 3pq \).

## Predictions:
- **below_basic:** At this level, students struggle with basic algebraic concepts. 
  - A: 30% (Adding instead of multiplying, or confusion with the order of operations)
  - B: 20% (Misinterpreting "three lots of \( q \)" as \( q^3 \))
  - C: 25% (Adding \( p \) and \( q \) after correctly identifying \( 3q \))
  - D: 25% (Correct understanding and application)

- **basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still make careless errors.
  - A: 15% 
  - B: 10% 
  - C: 15% 
  - D: 60% 

- **proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of algebraic concepts.
  - A: 5% 
  - B: 5% 
  - C: 5% 
  - D: 85% 

- **advanced:** At this level, students not only understand but can apply concepts in complex situations.
  - A: 2% 
  - B: 1% 
  - C: 2% 
  - D: 95% 

The best answer is D.
