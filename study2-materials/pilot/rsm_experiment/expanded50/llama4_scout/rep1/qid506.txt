## Step 1: Analyze the equation and the correct solution
The given equation is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\). To solve for \(p\), we divide both sides by 3, which gives \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 2: Identify the correct answer
From the calculation in Step 1, the correct answer is \(p = \frac{1}{36}\), which corresponds to option B.

## 3: Error Analysis for each wrong answer
A) \(p = \frac{1}{4}\): A student might arrive at this answer by incorrectly multiplying \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3 instead of dividing by 3, or by misunderstanding the division of fractions.

B) \(p = \frac{1}{36}\): This is the correct answer, not an error.

C) \(p = 4\): A student might get this by incorrectly inverting the fraction and multiplying by 3, or other significant calculation mistakes.

D) \(p = \frac{1}{9}\): This could result from a student multiplying \(\frac{1}{12}\) by \(\frac{3}{1}\) and getting \(\frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\) (which is incorrect for this context) or another incorrect operation.

## 4: Detailed Error Analysis
A) To get \(p = \frac{1}{4}\), a student might think \(3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\), which is incorrect because it misinterprets the operation needed to solve for \(p\).

B) \(p = \frac{1}{36}\) is correct, achieved by \(\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

C) For \(p = 4\), a significant misunderstanding or miscalculation is needed, such as \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) becoming \(p = 3 \times 12 = 36\) or another wrong operation.

D) For \(p = \frac{1}{9}\), a possible mistake is dividing 1 by 3 and then thinking of the 12 as a factor in a different context, or \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) leads to \(p = \frac{1}{12} - 3\) (which is not correct).
