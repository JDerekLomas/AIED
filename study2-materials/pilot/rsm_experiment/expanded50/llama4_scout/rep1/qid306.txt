## Error Analysis:

A) For Problem P, choosing \( 4-5 \) first might seem correct due to left-to-right processing, but it ignores the proper order of operations which in this case, given there are no brackets or multiplication/division, still requires going from left to right for addition and subtraction. For Problem Q, choosing \( 4+5 \) first is incorrect because it neglects the multiplication, which should be performed before addition according to the order of operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS/PEDMAS).

B) For Problem P, \( 4-5 \) is correct to do first because the operations are performed from left to right. For Problem Q, \( 5 \times 6 \) is the correct operation to do first, following the order of operations.

C) For Problem P, \( 5+6 \) should not be done first according to the correct order of operations (addition and subtraction are performed from left to right), making this an error. For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \) is incorrect as it does not follow the order of operations (multiplication should be done first).

D) For Problem P, \( 5+6 \) is incorrect to do first; it violates the left-to-right rule for addition and subtraction. For Problem Q, \( 5 \times 6 \) is correct.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the order of operations. They might rely on simple left-to-right processing or not fully grasp the rules.
  - A=40% (mix of incorrect ordering understanding)
  - B=10% (recognizing Q's correct operation)
  - C=30% (misunderstanding both)
  - D=20% (some understanding of Q but not P)

- **Basic:** These students have a basic understanding but might still confuse operations.
  - A=20% 
  - B=30% (understanding Q’s operation and basic P understanding)
  - C=20% 
  - D=30% (recognizing Q and making an error on P)

- **Proficient:** Students here generally understand the order of operations but might make minor errors under pressure.
  - A=5% 
  - B=80% (proper understanding of both)
  - C=10% 
  - D=5%

- **Advanced:** These students would consistently apply the order of operations correctly.
  - A=0% 
  - B=95% 
  - C=0% 
  - D=5% 

The best answer is B.
