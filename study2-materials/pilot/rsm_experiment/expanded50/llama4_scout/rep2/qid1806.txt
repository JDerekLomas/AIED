## Step 1: Analyzing the question and possible answers
The question asks for the correct algebraic notation of "\( p \) multiplied by three lots of \( q \)". This means we are looking for the expression that represents \( p \times 3q \) or \( p \times 3 \times q \).

## 2: Identifying the correct answer
The correct algebraic notation for "\( p \) multiplied by three lots of \( q \)" is \( p \times 3q = 3pq \). So, the correct answer is D) \( 3pq \).

## 3: Error Analysis for each wrong answer
A) \( 3p + q \): A student might choose this by adding instead of multiplying, or by misunderstanding the phrase "three lots of \( q \)" as \( 3 + q \) instead of \( 3q \), and then simply adding \( 3p \) without properly applying the multiplication.

B) \( pq^3 \): This error suggests a student misunderstands "three lots of \( q \)" as \( q \) raised to the power of 3, rather than \( q \) multiplied by 3. They then correctly multiply \( p \) by \( q^3 \) but misinterpret the original phrase.

C) \( pq + 3 \): A student choosing this might think "three lots of \( q \)" means \( q \) multiplied by 3, but then they add 3 instead of multiplying \( p \) by \( 3q \). It seems they partially understand the concept but incorrectly apply the operations.

## 4: Predicting the response distribution based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic notation or the concept of "lots of". They are more likely to make simple errors such as adding or misunderstanding the multiplication.
- **Basic**: Students here have some understanding but might struggle with applying it correctly, possibly confusing operations or misinterpreting the problem statement.
- **Proficient**: These students have a good grasp of algebraic notation and operations but might occasionally make minor errors due to oversight or temporary confusion.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong understanding and rarely make errors, but when they do, it might be due to a more complex misconception or a simple slip.

## 5: Assigning percentages
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (simple addition error), B=20% (misunderstanding of exponentiation), C=20% (partial understanding, incorrect operation), D=20% (some understanding of multiplication).
- **Basic**: A=25% (addition), B=15% (exponentiation mistake), C=20% (incorrect operation), D=40% (correct understanding).
- **Proficient**: A=10% (less common simple errors), B=5% (rare misinterpretation), C=5% (occasional minor mistake), D=80% (strong understanding).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (virtually no simple errors), B=0% (correct understanding of operations), C=0% (no operation mistakes), D=100% (excellent understanding).

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student might choose this by adding instead of multiplying, or by misunderstanding the phrase "three lots of \( q \)" as \( 3 + q \) instead of \( 3q \), and then simply adding \( 3p \) without properly applying the multiplication.
B) This error suggests a student misunderstands "three lots of \( q \)" as \( q \) raised to the power of 3, rather than \( q \) multiplied by 3.
C) A student choosing this might think "three lots of \( q \)" means \( q \) multiplied by 3, but then they add 3 instead of multiplying \( p \) by \( 3q \).
D) No error, this is the correct answer.
