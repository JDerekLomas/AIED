## Step 1: Understand the task
The task requires analyzing a multiple-choice question about finding the gradient of a line given in the form \(5x + 3y = 15\). The question is to identify the specific calculation error or misconception that leads to each wrong answer and then predict the percentage of students at different ability levels (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option.

## 2: Identify the correct answer
First, let's find the correct answer. The equation of a line can be rewritten in the slope-intercept form, \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the gradient. Rearranging \(5x + 3y = 15\) gives \(3y = -5x + 15\), and then \(y = -\frac{5}{3}x + 5\). Thus, the gradient \(m\) of the line is \(-\frac{5}{3}\), which corresponds to option D.

## 3: Error Analysis
A) To arrive at a gradient of \(5\), a student might mistakenly use the coefficient of \(x\) without considering the coefficient of \(y\) or incorrectly rearrange the equation, ignoring the need to isolate \(y\).

B) For a gradient of \(-5\), a student might incorrectly rearrange the equation and misinterpret the signs or coefficients, possibly considering the negative of the coefficient of \(x\) but not adjusting for \(y\)'s coefficient.

C) A gradient of \(\frac{5}{3}\) could result from a student mistakenly dividing the coefficient of \(x\) by the coefficient of \(y\) without considering the proper rearrangement to solve for \(y\), or incorrectly applying the formula for slope.

D) The correct gradient is \(-\frac{5}{3}\), which requires correctly rearranging the equation into slope-intercept form.

## 4: Specific Errors
A) A student choosing A might directly take the coefficient of \(x\) as the slope, ignoring the \(y\) term, or make a calculation mistake that results in this value.

B) A student choosing B might incorrectly apply the concept of slope or make a sign error when rearranging the equation.

C) A student choosing C might mistakenly think the slope is the ratio of the coefficients of \(x\) to \(y\) without reversing the signs appropriately.

## 5: Predictions
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand how to rearrange the equation or calculate the gradient. They might choose A (20%) because they see \(5\) as a prominent number, B (15%) due to confusion with negative signs, C (25%) because they try simple ratios, and D (40%) if they somehow arrive at or guess the correct answer.
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding but might struggle with rearranging equations. They might choose A (10%) for similar reasons, B (10%) for sign errors, C (30%) for incorrect applications of formulas, and D (50%) as they have a better grasp of slope calculation.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the concepts but might make careless mistakes. They might choose A (5%) or B (5%) due to oversight, C (20%) for minor errors in calculation, and D (70%) as they accurately calculate the gradient.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students have a deep understanding and are less likely to make errors. They might choose A (1%), B (1%), or C (5%) due to very minor lapses, and D (93%) as they correctly and efficiently determine the gradient.

The final answer is: 

Error Analysis:
A) A student might directly take the coefficient of \(x\) as the slope.
B) A student might incorrectly apply the concept of slope or make a sign error.
C) A student might mistakenly think the slope is the ratio of the coefficients of \(x\) to \(y\).
D) No error, correct answer.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=30% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=20% D=70%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=5% D=93%
