## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a diagram with three intersecting lines. Two of the lines intersect at a point where two angles are marked: 138 degrees and 42 degrees. The angle opposite the 42-degree angle is marked as \( p \). The task is to find the size of angle \( p \).

## 2: Identifying the Correct Relationship
Since the 138-degree and 42-degree angles form a straight line with angle \( p \) and another angle (which is not directly relevant to finding \( p \) but helps to understand the diagram), we note that the angle adjacent to the 42-degree angle and \( p \) will help in determining \( p \). Knowing that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees is crucial.

## 3: Calculating Angle \( p \)
The angle supplementary to \( p \) (let's call it \( x \)) and the 138-degree angle are related in that \( p + 42^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \) because \( p \) and 42 degrees are supplementary to the same angle (or directly, \( p \) and 42 degrees are on a straight line). However, to directly calculate \( p \):
Given that a straight line's angles sum to 180 degrees, and noting the 138 degrees is an exterior angle to the triangle or intersection point of interest, \( p = 42^{\circ} \) because vertically opposite angles are equal.

## 4: Error Analysis
A) \( 53^{\circ} \): A student might incorrectly apply the angle sum property of a triangle or mistakenly use the exterior angle theorem without properly identifying relevant angles.
B) \( 42^{\circ} \): Correct application of vertically opposite angles being equal.
C) \( 138^{\circ} \): A student might incorrectly assume \( p \) is equal to the exterior angle shown or get confused with supplementary angles.
D) Not enough information: A student might think they cannot solve \( p \) without more details.

## 5: Specific Errors
A) A student choosing A might have miscalculated or misunderstood the properties of intersecting lines and angles, possibly using an incorrect formula or wrongly applying geometric principles.
B) Choosing B directly results from correctly understanding vertically opposite angles.
C) For C, a student may confuse the given angle with \( p \) or misunderstand supplementary angles.
D) For D, a student may genuinely not understand how to use given information.

## 6: Predictions
Given typical student understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (guessing, lacks understanding), B=20% (some correct intuition but lacks clarity), C=30% (confusion with given numbers), D=20% (not recognizing relevant information).
- **Basic**: A=20% (simple miscalculation), B=40% (understands basic principles), C=25% (mix-up with angles), D=15% (some confusion).
- **Proficient**: A=10% (occasional mistake), B=70% (solid understanding of angle properties), C=15% (careless error), D=5% (rarely lacks understanding).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (almost no chance of simple error), B=90% (easily recognizes angle relationships), C=3% (very rare mistake), D=2% (nearly always understands).

The best answer is B. 

Error Analysis:
A) A student might think that angles in a triangle add to 180 degrees and incorrectly try to form an equation with the given angles.
B) Correctly identifies that vertically opposite angles are equal.
C) A student might confuse the exterior angle with angle \( p \).
D) A student might believe there's insufficient information due to misunderstanding how angles relate.

Predictions:

basic: A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%
