## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks how many degrees Ada has turned when she moves from facing Northwest (NW) to facing South (S) in a clockwise direction.

## 2: Identifying Key Directions and Their Angles
- Northwest (NW) is at 315 degrees on a compass (since North is 0/360 degrees and West is 270 degrees, NW is halfway between, which is 315 degrees).
- South (S) is at 180 degrees on a compass.

## 3: Calculating the Turn
To find out how many degrees Ada turned, we subtract the initial direction from the final direction. However, since Ada turns clockwise, we need to consider the direction of turn:
\[ \text{Degrees turned} = 180^\circ - 315^\circ = -135^\circ \]
Since a turn is positive when it's clockwise and we are calculating the magnitude of the turn:
\[ \text{Degrees turned} = 360^\circ - 135^\circ = 225^\circ \]

## 4: Error Analysis
A) \( 225^{\degree} \): This is actually the correct answer. A student who understands the initial and final positions and calculates correctly will choose this.

B) \( 315^{\degree} \): This would be an error where a student thinks Ada turned from NW to S in a counterclockwise direction or misunderstands the starting and ending points. 

C) \( 135^{\degree} \): A student might choose this if they incorrectly visualize the turn or miscalculate the angle. For example, calculating the direct angle without considering the full circle or mistakenly thinking she's turning to face SE (which would be 135 degrees from NW in the counterclockwise direction).

D) \( 180^{\degree} \): This could be chosen by a student who oversimplifies the problem, thinking Ada just turns directly to the opposite direction without accounting for the starting direction of NW.

## 5: Predictions
- **Below Basic**: Students with below-basic skills might randomly select or pick an obvious but incorrect answer. 
  - A = 20% (guessing the high angle)
  - B = 20% (confused with full circle or misinterpretation)
  - C = 30% (possibly underestimating or misunderstanding the directions)
  - D = 30% (mistaking for a simple 180-degree turn)

- **Basic**: Students at a basic level understand some directional concepts but might lack precision in calculation.
  - A = 30% (calculating directly but possibly with errors)
  - B = 15% (may start to see full compass but confuse directions)
  - C = 40% (partial understanding but inaccurate calculations)
  - D = 15% (may still opt for over-simplification)

- **Proficient**: Proficient students should have a good grasp of compass directions.
  - A = 60% (know how to calculate angles and directions accurately)
  - B = 5% (more awareness but possibly less calculation accuracy in heat of moment)
  - C = 20% (might calculate through direct observation rather than always through clockwise/counterclockwise strategy)
  - D = 15% (over-simplification errors lessen but occur)

- **Advanced**: Advanced students are familiar with strategy application but choose wrong perhaps through error or haste.
  - A = 80% (correct because they accurately compute based on their well-developed map/circle and rotational understanding)
  - B = 2% 
  - C = 10% 
  - D = 8%

The final answer is: 
Error Analysis:
A) A student selecting A chooses the actual right answer, hence no specific error; it's insight we validate, given complete map rotation data considered & NW orientation to targeted facing (South Orientation)
B) A miscalculation leading student thinking directly turning South from their Northwest would rotate wrong orientation from South
C) An arithmetic misestimation resulting likely given initial versus concluding rotational difference computed in NW versus in  N position then concluding towards west  North or to the South from that compass reference setting position or in similar turn strategy reference
D) oversimplification of angles
Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=60% B=5% C=20% D=15%
advanced: A=80% B=2% C=10% D=8%
