## Step 1: Analyzing Problem P
Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \). According to the order of operations, we should perform addition and subtraction from left to right. Therefore, the correct calculation order is \( 4-5 \) first, then add 6.

## 2: Analyzing Problem Q
Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication should be performed before addition. So, the correct calculation order is \( 5 \times 6 \) first, then add 4.

## 3: Error Analysis for Option A
A) Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \). For Problem P, the student correctly identifies \( 4-5 \) as the first operation. For Problem Q, the student incorrectly suggests \( 4+5 \) first, neglecting the multiplication.

## 4: Error Analysis for Option B
B) Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \). This option correctly identifies the first operation for both problems, following the order of operations.

## 5: Error Analysis for Option C
C) Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \). For Problem P, the student incorrectly suggests \( 5+6 \) first, not adhering to the left-to-right rule for subtraction and addition. For Problem Q, the student incorrectly prioritizes \( 4+5 \) over \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 6: Error Analysis for Option D
D) Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \). For Problem P, the student makes an error by suggesting \( 5+6 \) first instead of \( 4-5 \). For Problem Q, the student correctly identifies \( 5 \times 6 \) as the first operation.

## 7: Specific Errors
- Option A: Incorrect prioritization in Problem Q.
- Option C: Misunderstanding of operation order in both problems.
- Option D: Misunderstanding of operation order in Problem P.

## 8: Predictions
- **Below Basic**: Students may struggle with understanding the order of operations. They might randomly select or misunderstand the sequence. 
  - A: 20% (some understanding but misapplied)
  - B: 10% (correct but rare due to general confusion)
  - C: 30% (misunderstanding of basic addition/subtraction and multiplication precedence)
  - D: 40% (some recognition of multiplication importance but confusion)

- **Basic**: Students have a foundational understanding but may apply it inconsistently.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 50% (correct understanding)
  - C: 20%
  - D: 20%

- **Proficient**: Students generally understand the order of operations.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 80%
  - C: 10%
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced**: Students consistently apply the order of operations correctly and understand the underlying concepts.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 90%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 5%

The best answer is B.
