## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks to solve for \( \star \) in the equation \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \). This involves isolating \( \star \) by dividing both sides of the equation by \( -\frac{3}{4} \), which is equivalent to multiplying both sides by the reciprocal \( -\frac{4}{3} \).

## 2: Solve the equation
To solve for \( \star \), we multiply both sides by \( -\frac{4}{3} \):
\[ \star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} \]
\[ \star = \frac{4}{3} \]

## 3: Error Analysis
A) To arrive at \( \frac{4}{3} \) is actually the correct solution, so no error is made by choosing A.

B) Choosing \( -\frac{4}{3} \) would involve incorrectly applying the sign change or misunderstanding the operation: If a student forgot to change the sign when multiplying by a negative number or incorrectly solved the equation, they might get this.

C) Choosing \( \frac{3}{4} \) could result from a student incorrectly setting up the equation or solving it as \( \frac{-1}{-\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{3}{4} \), which doesn't follow from standard algebraic manipulations.

D) Choosing \( -\frac{3}{4} \) might come from adding or subtracting incorrectly or thinking \( \star = -1 \times -\frac{3}{4} \) results in \( -\frac{3}{4} \) due to wrong handling of the negative signs.

## 4: Specific errors
A) No error.

B) Incorrect handling of negative signs or misunderstanding of division by a fraction.

C) Incorrect division or solving strategy.

D) Misapplication of algebraic rules or incorrect.

## 5: Predictions
