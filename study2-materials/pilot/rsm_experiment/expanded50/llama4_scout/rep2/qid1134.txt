## Error Analysis:

A) To arrive at \(-18\), a student would incorrectly subtract \(7\) from \(-11\) without considering the sign change or applying the correct operation for adding a positive number, essentially performing \(-11 - 7\).

B) For \(-4\), a student might mistakenly think that adding \(7\) to \(-11\) would result in a number close to but not quite reaching \(0\), possibly performing the calculation incorrectly as \(-11 + 11 = 0\) and then subtracting \(7\) to get \(-7\), but inaccurately getting \(-4\).

C) To get \(-5\), a student likely understands that adding a positive number decreases the absolute value of a negative number but performs the calculation as \(-11 + 7 = -5\) correctly, which might indicate a lucky guess or correct calculation.

D) For \(18\), a student would incorrectly add the absolute values of \(-11\) and \(7\) and then incorrectly assign a positive sign, or simply misinterpret the operation as a multiplication or incorrectly apply rules of signs.

## Predictions:

- **below_basic:** At this level, students struggle with basic arithmetic operations.
  - A: \(30\%\) (Inability to perform addition with negative numbers)
  - B: \(15\%\) (Poor understanding of number lines or incorrect calculation)
  - C: \(45\%\) (Lucky guess or simple, correct calculation)
  - D: \(10\%\) (Misinterpretation of operation or signs)

- **basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but make some errors.
  - A: \(20\%\) (Basic operation misunderstanding)
  - B: \(25\%\) (Incorrect application of rules)
  - C: \(50\%\) (Correct calculation or understanding)
  - D: \(5\%\) (Significant misinterpretation)

- **proficient:** These students understand the operations but might occasionally make careless mistakes.
  - A: \(5\%\) (Careless mistake)
  - B: \(10\%\) (Small error in calculation)
  - C: \(80\%\) (Correct application of rules)
  - D: \(5\%\) (Serious miscalculation)

- **advanced:** At this level, students rarely make errors in basic calculations.
  - A: \(1\%\) (Unlikely, but a simple oversight)
  - B: \(2\%\) (Miscalculation)
  - C: \(95\%\) (Confident and correct calculation)
  - D: \(2\%\) (Very unlikely, significant mistake)

The final answer is:

Error Analysis:
A) A student would incorrectly subtract 7 from -11 without considering the sign change.
B) A student might mistakenly adjust -11 towards 0 by 7.
C) A student likely performs the calculation correctly.
D) A student would incorrectly add the absolute values.
