## Step 1: Analyze the given equation and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \( k \), we first multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which yields \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \), simplifying to \( 60 = 1 + k \). Then, we subtract 1 from both sides to solve for \( k \), resulting in \( k = 60 - 1 = 59 \).

## 2: Evaluate Isaac's steps
Isaac's Step 1: \( 60 = 1 + k \) is correct because multiplying both sides of the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \) by 4 gives \( 60 = 1 + k \).
Isaac's Step 2: \( 61 = k \) is incorrect because subtracting 1 from both sides of \( 60 = 1 + k \) yields \( k = 59 \), not \( k = 61 \).

## 3: Error Analysis for each option
A) Only step 1: A student choosing this option acknowledges that Step 1 is correct but fails to verify the correctness of Step 2 or assumes Step 2's error without evaluating its validity.
B) Only step 2: This choice indicates a student who incorrectly believes Step 2 is right but Step 1 is wrong, possibly due to not understanding the algebraic manipulation or mistakenly thinking Step 1 was incorrect.
C) Both steps are correct: This would imply a misunderstanding of basic algebraic operations, as Step 2 incorrectly states \( k = 61 \) instead of \( k = 59 \).
D) Both steps are incorrect: Choosing this option would mean a student understands that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect, indicating some level of algebraic understanding.

## 4: Specific errors leading to each wrong answer
A) A student might choose A if they see Step 1 as correct but do not evaluate Step 2 properly or consider the equation solved at Step 1.
B) Choosing B suggests a student thinks Step 2's result (\( k = 61 \)) is correct without properly checking, possibly indicating a calculation mistake or lack of understanding in solving for \( k \).
C) Selecting C indicates a student does not recognize the mistake in Step 2 (\( k = 61 \) instead of \( k = 59 \)), suggesting a lack of careful algebraic manipulation.
D) D would be chosen by a student who understands both steps' validity, correctly identifying Step 1 as right and Step 2 as wrong.

## 5: Predictions based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might choose C (Both steps are correct) because they don't catch the error in Step 2, or D (Both steps are incorrect) if they recognize an issue but not the specific correctness of Step 1. 
  - below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes. They could choose A (Only step 1) for recognizing Step 1's correctness but not fully evaluating Step 2, or B (Only step 2) for mistakenly thinking Step 2 is correct.
  - basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebra well and are likely to see Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect, making D a likely choice.
  - proficient: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will easily spot the correctness of Step 1 and the error in Step 2, likely choosing D.
  - advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is: 

Error Analysis:
A) A student acknowledges Step 1 is correct but does not verify or consider Step 2's validity properly.
B) A student believes Step 2 is correct but Step 1 is wrong, indicating a possible calculation mistake.
C) A student does not recognize the mistake in Step 2.
D) A student understands that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect.
