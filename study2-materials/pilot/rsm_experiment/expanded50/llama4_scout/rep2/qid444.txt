## Step 1: Understand the question and identify the correct answer.
To find the 3-digit number that belongs in the box, we need to solve the equation \(258 + \square = 1162\). Subtracting 258 from both sides gives \(\square = 1162 - 258 = 904\). Thus, the 3-digit number is 904, and the 3rd digit of this number is 4.

## 2: Analyze the error for each wrong answer.
A) Choosing A (0) suggests a student might be incorrectly subtracting or misunderstanding the place value, possibly thinking the result of \(1162 - 258\) ends in 0, which is incorrect.
B) Choosing B (2) could result from a miscalculation or incorrect subtraction, possibly \(1162 - 258 = 902\) (missing the correct calculation), or mistakenly taking the first digit of 1162 and relating it to the subtraction.
C) Choosing C (6) might come from directly taking a digit from the given numbers without performing the calculation, such as seeing 1162 and thinking of its digits directly without computation.

## 3: Specify the errors.
A) A student choosing A might be performing the calculation but incorrectly handling the subtraction, such as \(1162 - 200 = 962\), then \(962 - 50 = 912\), and \(912 - 8 = 904\), but only seeing or remembering the last digit.
B) For B, a student could be adding instead of subtracting, or mistaking the operation: \(1162 + 258\) instead of subtracting, which leads to a wrong operation and thus wrong digits.
C) For C, it might indicate confusion with the given numbers directly, possibly misinterpreting how to solve for the missing digit without actual calculation.

## 4: Make predictions based on student ability levels.
- Below_basic: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations. They might choose A or C due to confusion or not attempting the calculation.
- Basic: Students here can perform basic calculations but might make careless mistakes. They could choose A, B, or C due to errors in calculation or misunderstanding.
- Proficient: Students at this level can solve the equation correctly but might still select wrong answers due to moments of carelessness or incorrect shortcuts.
- Advanced: These students are expected to solve the problem accurately and quickly.

## 5: Detailed Predictions.
- **Error Analysis:**
A) A student might incorrectly subtract or add, getting a number that ends in 0.
B) Incorrect operation or mistake in handling digits during subtraction.
C) Might not perform calculation, sticks with known digits.
D) Correct answer.

## 6: Final Predictions.
Given typical student performance:
- **Below_basic:** A=40% (lack of understanding), B=15% (misoperation), C=30% (confusion), D=15% (correct, surprisingly).
- **Basic:** A=20% (careless error), B=15% (mistake in operation), C=10% (not calculating), D=55% (correct calculation).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (rare error), B=5% (small mistake), C=5% (oversight), D=85% (accurate).
- **Advanced:** A=1% (unlikely error), B=1% (small oversight), C=2% (minor confusion), D=96% (near-perfect accuracy).

The final answer is: 

Error Analysis:
A) A student might perform \(1162 - 258\) but end up focusing on or misinterpreting the result to conclude with a 0.
B) Incorrectly performing the subtraction to get a mistaken second digit of 2 in the result.
C) Taking a direct digit from numbers provided.
D) No error, as it is the correct solution.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=2% D=96%
