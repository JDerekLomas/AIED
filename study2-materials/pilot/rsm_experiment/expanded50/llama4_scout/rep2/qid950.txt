## Error Analysis:
A) To choose A as not a surd, a student might mistakenly think that \(\sqrt{45}\) is a perfect square because \(45 = 9 \times 5\) and \(9\) is a perfect square, but they forget that \(\sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \times 5} = 3\sqrt{5}\), which is indeed a surd.

B) To choose B as not a surd, a student would need to incorrectly believe that \(\sqrt{47}\) can be simplified into a whole number or a simple fraction, which is not possible since 47 is a prime number and not a perfect square.

C) To choose C as not a surd, a student correctly identifies that \(\sqrt{49} = 7\), which is a whole number and therefore not a surd. This choice reflects a correct understanding.

D) To choose D as not a surd, similar to B, a student would mistakenly think \(\sqrt{51}\) simplifies to a whole number or simple fraction, which doesn't happen because 51 is not a perfect square.

## Predictions:
- **below_basic:** At this level, students might not fully understand what constitutes a surd. They might randomly select or mistakenly think \(\sqrt{45}\) or \(\sqrt{51}\) could be perfect squares or simplify incorrectly.
  - A=20% (thinking \(\sqrt{45}\) simplifies to a whole number), B=25% (not understanding \(\sqrt{47}\)), C=30% (not recognizing \(\sqrt{49}\) as a whole number), D=25% (similar misconception as B).

- **basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make mistakes with prime numbers and properties of squares.
  - A=15% (squaring numbers and root properties mixed up), B=20% (not realizing 47 is prime and not a perfect square), C=10% (correctly identifying \(\sqrt{49}\) but struggling elsewhere), D=55% (assuming \(\sqrt{51}\) could simplify).

- **proficient:** These students understand surds and can usually identify them correctly but might still hesitate on less familiar numbers.
  - A=5% (small chance of overconfidence in simplifying), B=10% (recognize 47 is prime but question its surd status), C=5% (usually straightforward), D=80% (focus on less familiar prime-based surds).

- **advanced:** Students at this level are confident and clear on what constitutes a surd.
  - A=0% (very confident \(\sqrt{45}\) simplifies to a surd), B=0% (easy identification of \(\sqrt{47}\) as a surd), C=95% (very confident \(\sqrt{49}\) equals 7), D=5% (spot \(\sqrt{51}\) but solidly understand all as correct answers or errors elsewhere are considered negligible).

The final answer is: 
## Error Analysis:
A) A student might think \(\sqrt{45}\) simplifies to a whole number because \(45 = 9 \times 5\).
B) A student would think \(\sqrt{47}\) can be simplified.
C) A student correctly identifies \(\sqrt{49}\) as 7.
D) A student would mistakenly think \(\sqrt{51}\) simplifies.

## Predictions:
below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=10% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
