## Error Analysis:

A) To arrive at answer A (271), a student might mistakenly convert CCXLIX into a decimal system by incorrectly adding the values of C (100), C (100), XL (40), and IX (9), possibly due to confusion in understanding Roman numerals, specifically misinterpreting the subtraction principle in Roman numerals (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9). The correct calculation would be 100 + 100 + 40 + 9 = 249. An incorrect addition like 200 + 40 + 9 + 2 (misinterpreting C as 200 instead of 100*2=200 directly for CC) could theoretically suggest an inflation.

B) For answer B (269), a student could mistakenly believe the Roman numeral conversion involves direct substitution without applying the correct rules: CC = 200, XL = 40, IX = 9, resulting in 200 + 40 + 9 + 20 (erroneously adding 20, possibly confusing IX with a higher value or miscalculating). The likely error involves confusing the positioning or the numerals.

C) For answer C (249), it seems this would actually be the correct conversion (CC = 200, XL = 40, IX = 9; 200 + 40 + 9 = 249), suggesting students who select other options are making errors.

D) For answer D (259), a student could possibly add 10 to the correct Roman numeral translation (249 + 10 = 259), potentially misinterpreting the last numeral or making a basic arithmetic mistake during conversion, believing they correctly added the parts but ending up with 259.

## Predictions:

Given the misconceptions and assuming typical student performance patterns:

- **Below Basic**: At this level, students have limited understanding. They might randomly select or demonstrate very basic errors lacking deep comprehension of Roman numerals. Expect a higher dispersion across wrong answers.
  - A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but struggle with application. Fewer random guesses, more reflect misunderstanding of Roman numeral rules.
  - A=25% B=25% C=30% D=20%

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp but might still make simple arithmetic errors or confusion with numeral positions.
  - A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%

- **Advanced**: Students here should easily convert CCXLIX to 249. Very few incorrect answers expected.
  - A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%

Adjustments can depend on familiarity with Roman numerals specifically and general arithmetic confidence. Proficiency here particularly leads to a recognition of C as correct.
