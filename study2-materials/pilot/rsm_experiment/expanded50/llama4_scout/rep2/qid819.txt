## Error Analysis:

A) To arrive at answer A (14), a student might incorrectly apply the operation as \(6 + 8 = 14\), ignoring the negative sign in front of the 8. This shows a lack of understanding of subtracting a negative number, which is equivalent to adding a positive number.

B) For answer B (-14), a student might mistakenly think that subtracting a negative number is equivalent to subtracting a positive number, leading to \(6 - 8 = -2\) and then incorrectly adjusting or simply misinterpreting the signs, but more likely, they simply performed \(6 - 8 = -2\) and mistakenly wrote \(-14\) or confused the operation entirely.

C) Answer C (2) could result from a student incorrectly performing the operation as \(6 - 8 = -2\) and then mistakenly thinking that subtracting a negative is the same as adding, but mistakenly not adjusting the \(-2\) correctly.

D) For answer D (-2), a student might incorrectly calculate \(6 - 8 = -2\), applying the subtraction correctly but forgetting to change the sign of the second term when subtracting a negative, which should actually result in \(6 + 8\).


## Predictions:

Given the question and typical student understanding:

- **Below Basic**: At this level, students have significant difficulties with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of number lines. They are likely to make simple arithmetic errors or misunderstand the concept of negative numbers.
  - A=40% (Ignoring negative sign, simply adding)
  - B=20% (Misunderstanding of operations with negative numbers)
  - C=15% (confusing with simple subtraction)
  - D=25% (Confusing with basic subtraction)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still struggle with applying rules for negative numbers.
  - A=30% (Overlooking the negative and adding)
  - B=10% (Misapplication of rules for negative numbers)
  - C=5% (Incorrect simple subtraction)
  - D=55% (Simple subtraction error)

- **Proficient**: These students generally understand the operations with negative numbers but might still make occasional errors under stress or with complex problems.
  - A=10% (Overconfidence and overlooking the operation change)
  - B=5% (Careless application of a misconception)
  - C=5% (This option doesn't result from a likely common error for proficient students)
  - D=80% (Actually applying their knowledge correctly)

- **Advanced**: Advanced students are assumed to have a deeper and more flexible understanding of mathematical concepts.
  - A=0% (Understand operation)
  - B=0% (Correct understanding)
  - C=5% (Might have difficulty due to very high performance expectation or fatigue)
  - D=95% (Knowing subtracting a negative switches to addition)
