## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct expansion involves using the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) or the distributive property.

## 2: Correct Expansion
To expand \((m-5)(m-7)\) correctly:
\[m \cdot m + m \cdot (-7) - 5 \cdot m - 5 \cdot (-7)\]
\[= m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\]
\[= m^2 - 12m + 35\]
So, the correct answer is B) \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 3: Error Analysis for A) \(m^2 - 2m - 35\)
A student choosing A) \(m^2 - 2m - 35\) might have incorrectly applied the FOIL method or distributive property, possibly resulting in incorrect addition/subtraction of the terms. A likely mistake is:
\[m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35\]
However, this matches D, not A. A possible correct error for A could be:
\[m^2 + 0m - 35 = m^2 - 35\], which doesn't fit. A plausible mistake for A could involve not considering the middle terms properly or a simple arithmetic error.

## 4: Error Analysis for B) \(m^2 - 12m + 35\)
This is the correct answer, so no error analysis is needed.

## 5: Error Analysis for C) \(m^2 + 12m + 35\)
A student choosing C) \(m^2 + 12m + 35\) likely made a mistake in the signs during expansion:
\[m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35\]
Should give:
\[m^2 - 12m + 35\]
But if they added the \(m\) terms instead of subtracting:
\[m^2 - 7m - 5m = m^2 - 12m\] (correct), but what if they got \(+12m\):
This implies they could have used \(+7m + 5m = +12m\) or made a sign error in calculations.

## 6: Error Analysis for D) \(m^2 - 12m - 35\)
A student selecting D) \(m^2 - 12m - 35\) probably made a sign mistake in adding the constants:
\[m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\]
Should result in \(+35\), not \(-35\), suggesting an error like:
\[+35 - 70 = -35\] or incorrect combination of terms.

## 7: Detailed Error for A) \(m^2 - 2m - 35\)
If a student chose A, it could actually be due to incorrectly factoring or adding/subtracting exponents/terms, not following FOIL properly:
\[m^2 - (7+5)m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35\] wasn't committed here directly; A could arise from direct expansion then addition/balancing issue \(m(m) = m^2\); \(-7m -5 = -2m\) and lastly the product \(= -35\).

## 8: Student Response Predictions
### below_basic
- A) Students who fail to multiply correctly but try to give linear factors: around **20%**; 
- B) No computation attempted past distribute step/accused partially (**20%**)
- C) Typically applies confusion by reversing logic to fit perceived known formulas = less direct understanding error = 30 
- D), commonly add all numerical/unknown segments; likely a substantial **30%**

### basic
- Here more systematic **A) incorrect method for expanding leads (~30-25)**: Students expand incorrectly assuming term factors add together  
- B, they can distribute well if slowly getting \(40
- Common C; wrongly combine exponents and coefficients **about~22/5  
   (~D well fitting incorrect model here \(**23; 
 A), D >50 likely C/B;
