## Step 1: Understand the equation and the task
The equation given is \( y = 2^x \), and we need to find the value of \( y \) when \( x = -5 \). This involves calculating \( 2^{-5} \).

## 2: Calculate the correct value
To calculate \( 2^{-5} \), we use the rule that \( a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n} \). Therefore, \( 2^{-5} = \frac{1}{2^5} = \frac{1}{32} \).

## 3: Analyze the errors for each wrong answer
A) \( -32 \): This would involve a misunderstanding of negative exponents and possibly a confusion with \( -2^5 \) or incorrectly applying a rule for negative exponents.

B) \( -\frac{1}{32} \): This suggests a student might be incorrectly applying a rule for negative exponents or mistakenly thinking that a negative exponent results in a negative value.

C) \( -10 \): This answer could result from a student not understanding exponents properly, possibly confusing the calculation with a linear or incorrect operation.

D) \( \frac{1}{32} \): This is the correct answer, as calculated.

## 4: Detailed error analysis
A) A student choosing \( -32 \) might be confusing \( 2^{-5} \) with \( -2^5 \) or \( (2^{-1})^5 = (-2)^5 \), demonstrating a lack of understanding of exponent rules.

B) For \( -\frac{1}{32} \), a student might mistakenly believe that raising to a negative power not only inverts the base but also changes its sign.

C) \( -10 \) could come from misinterpreting the exponentiation as a form of multiplication or addition that results in a linear decrease.

## 5: Predictions based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students struggle with basic mathematical concepts. They are more likely to choose answers that demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of exponents.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but may still struggle with applying rules for exponents, especially negative ones.

- **Proficient**: These students understand the basic rules of exponents but might still make careless mistakes or have some misconceptions.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a solid grasp of exponent rules and are less likely to make errors based on simple misunderstandings.

## 6: Specific predictions
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (confusing with linear or direct operations), B=20% (mistaken sign), C=30% (random or incorrect operation), D=10% (correct but unlikely).
- **Basic**: A=25%, B=30%, C=20%, D=25%.
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=15%, C=5%, D=70%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=5%, C=0%, D=95%.

## 7: Finalize predictions in the required format
Error Analysis:
A) A student might confuse \( 2^{-5} \) with \(-2^5\) or misunderstand the negative exponent rule.
B) A student may mistakenly think a negative exponent makes the result negative.
C) A student could mistakenly apply a linear or incorrect operation.
D) Correct calculation of \( 2^{-5} \).

Predictions:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=5% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
