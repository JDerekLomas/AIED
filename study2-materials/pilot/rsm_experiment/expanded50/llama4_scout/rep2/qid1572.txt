## Step 1: Understand the task
The task involves analyzing a multiple-choice question about reflecting a point across the line \(y = -x\) and determining the errors that lead to each incorrect answer choice. The question provides a coordinate grid with a triangle and a dashed line representing \(y = -x\). Point \(P\) is at \((0,3)\), and the task is to find its reflection across \(y = -x\).

## 2: Reflection across \(y = -x\)
To reflect a point \((x, y)\) across the line \(y = -x\), the new coordinates become \((-y, -x)\). For point \(P(0,3)\), its reflection across \(y = -x\) would be \((-3, 0)\).

## 3: Error Analysis
A) To arrive at \((-6,3)\), a student might incorrectly apply a reflection across the x-axis or y-axis instead of \(y = -x\), or they might mistakenly multiply the coordinates by a factor.
B) For \((-3,6)\), a student might confuse the reflection process with a rotation or incorrect coordinate transformation, possibly thinking to negate one coordinate but not applying the correct transformation for \(y = -x\).
C) \((-3,3)\) could result from incorrectly applying a transformation that only negates one of the coordinates or adds/subtracts a value without properly considering the line of reflection.
D) The correct answer is \((-3,0)\), which results from properly reflecting \((0,3)\) across \(y = -x\), swapping and negating the coordinates.

## 4: Specific Errors
A) A student might mistakenly think reflecting across \(y = -x\) involves changing the sign of both coordinates but not swapping them, or apply an incorrect formula.
B) This could come from misapplying a rotation formula or confusing coordinate transformations.
C) A student might only negate one coordinate or incorrectly adjust based on a misunderstood rule for reflection.
D) Correct reflection.

## 5: Predictions
- **Below Basic**: Students might not understand reflections or coordinate changes. They might choose A or C due to simple sign errors or not understanding coordinate swapping (A=30% B=10% C=40% D=20%).
- **Basic**: Students have basic understanding but might struggle with coordinate transformations. They could choose A or B due to mix-ups in applying rules (A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%).
- **Proficient**: Students understand reflections but might still make careless errors. B becomes more likely as they might overcomplicate the transformation (A=10% B=25% C=15% D=50%).
- **Advanced**: Students are familiar with coordinate geometry. Errors are less likely but might still occur due to oversight (A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%).

## 6: Format Response
Error Analysis:
A) Incorrectly applying transformation or mistakenly altering coordinates without proper reflection.
B) Misunderstanding reflection as another type of transformation like rotation.
C) Incorrect negation or addition/subtraction of coordinates.
D) No error; correct application of reflection across \(y = -x\).
