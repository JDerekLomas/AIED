## Error Analysis:

A) To arrive at \( +4 \), a student might incorrectly multiply \( -1 \times -4 \) but forget the rule that two negative numbers multiplied together give a positive result, or they might simply not apply the multiplication correctly.

B) To arrive at \( -4 \), a student might apply the correct multiplication rule for \( -1 \times -4 \) which equals \( +4 \), but then mistakenly think the result should be negative due to a misunderstanding of the signs.

C) To arrive at \( +5 \), a student might mistakenly add \( -1 + (-4) \) instead of multiplying \( -1 \times -4 \), indicating a confusion between addition and multiplication operations.

D) To arrive at \( -5 \), a student might incorrectly apply the multiplication and then mistakenly add or subtract 1, or simply miscalculate \( -1 \times -4 = 4 \) and then think the answer needs to be adjusted to \( -5 \) for unclear reasons.

## Predictions:

### below_basic:
- A: 20% (simple error in calculation or not understanding the multiplication of negatives)
- B: 15% (applying incorrect rules for multiplication of negatives)
- C: 30% (confusing operations or incorrect basic calculation)
- D: 35% (overall confusion or direct incorrect calculation)

### basic:
- A: 10% (less likely to make simple sign errors)
- B: 5% (understanding of negatives improves)
- C: 20% (still some confusion between operations)
- D: 65% (mostly correct understanding but possible computational error)

### proficient:
- A: 2% (rare but possible mistake in sign or operation)
- B: 2% (similarly, rare mistake)
- C: 5% (confusion unlikely but possible)
- D: 91% (mostly accurate calculation)

### advanced:
- A: 0% (very unlikely to make basic calculation errors)
- B: 0% (accurately applies rules)
- C: 2% (extremely rare confusion)
- D: 98% (high accuracy in calculation)

The best answer is A.
