## Step 1: Understand the question and the conversion involved
The question involves converting 650 centilitres to litres. Knowing that 1 litre = 100 centilitres, we can convert 650 centilitres to litres by dividing 650 by 100, which equals 6.5 litres.

## 2: Analyze the errors leading to each wrong answer
A) For answer A (6.5), this is actually the correct answer, so no error is involved here.
B) For answer B (0.65), a student might mistakenly think that to convert centilitres to litres, they need to multiply by 10 instead of dividing by 100, or they incorrectly apply the conversion factor.
C) For answer C (65000), a student might incorrectly convert centilitres to litres by thinking 1 centilitre = 1000 litres or mistakenly multiplying by 100 instead of dividing by 100.
D) For answer D (65), a student might think that to convert centilitres to litres, they simply remove the prefix "centi-" without understanding its meaning (1/100), or they might mistakenly multiply by 10.

## 3: Specify the errors for each wrong answer
Error Analysis:
A) No error, correct conversion.
B) Incorrect conversion factor application, possibly multiplying by 0.01 (1/100) but misplacing the decimal or misunderstanding the conversion.
C) Misinterpreting the conversion: thinking 1 litre = 0.01 centilitres or mistakenly multiplying by 100.
D) Misunderstanding the "centi-" prefix: possibly thinking it means multiplying by 10 or 100.

## 4: Predict the response distribution based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often lack understanding of basic conversion factors and relationships between units. They are more likely to make significant errors.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but may struggle with applying conversion factors accurately.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the conversion factors and can apply them correctly but might make occasional mistakes under pressure or with complex conversions.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of conversion factors and can apply them accurately in various contexts.

## 5: Estimate percentages for each option based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: 
  - A (correct): 20% (some might get it by chance or familiarization)
  - B: 15% (misunderstanding of conversion)
  - C: 40% (significant miscalculation)
  - D: 25% (simple mistake in conversion)

- **Basic**:
  - A (correct): 60%
  - B: 20% 
  - C: 10%
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient**:
  - A (correct): 80%
  - B: 10%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced**:
  - A (correct): 95%
  - B: 3%
  - C: 1%
  - D: 1%

The final answer is: 

Error Analysis:
A) No error, correct conversion.
B) A student might believe 650 centilitres equals 0.65 litres, possibly confusing the conversion factor or misplacing decimals.
C) A student might think 1 centilitre = 1/1000 litres, leading to 650 * 100 = 65000.
D) A student might think 650 centilitres directly translates to 65 litres, misunderstanding the "centi-" prefix.
