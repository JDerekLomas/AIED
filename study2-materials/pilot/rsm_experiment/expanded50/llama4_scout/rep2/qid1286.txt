## Step 1: Understand the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

## 2: Derive the formula for the radius of a sphere
To find the radius \(r\) in terms of \(V\), we rearrange the formula:
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
\[r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\]
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]
This means the correct formula for the radius is \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\) cm.

## 3: Error Analysis for Option A
A) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \)
Error: A student might choose this by incorrectly rearranging the volume formula, possibly mistakenly multiplying by \(\pi\) and incorrectly handling the constants.

## 4: Error Analysis for Option B
B) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \)
Error: This could result from mistakenly omitting \(\pi\) from the denominator or incorrectly rearranging the formula, leading to \(\frac{4V}{3\pi}\) inside the cubic root.

## 5: Error Analysis for Option C
C) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \)
Error: None, this is actually the correct formula for the radius.

## 6: Error Analysis for Option D
D) \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \)
Error: A student might arrive at this by incorrectly taking the cubic root of \(V\) separately and then applying the rest of the formula incorrectly, not properly accounting for \(r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\).

## 7: Predictions for below_basic
- A: 20% (misinterpretation of constants and formula)
- B: 25% (confusion with formula, possibly misplacing \(\pi\))
- C: 30% (either knows the correct formula or guesses correctly)
- D: 25% (misapplication of operations)

## 8: Predictions for basic
- A: 15% (some understanding but mixes up operations)
- B: 20% (some formula knowledge but errors in constant handling)
- C: 45% (correct application or learns from common mistakes)
- D: 20% (overly simplistic or incorrect application)

## 9: Predictions for proficient
- A: 5% (solid understanding, less likely to misapply)
- B: 5% (likewise, strong foundation reduces error)
- C: 80% (confident in applying the correct formula)
- D: 10% (possibly from distraction or minor mistake)

## 10: Predictions for advanced
- A: 0% (extremely low chance of misapplication)
- B: 0% (similarly, very unlikely)
- C: 95% (almost certain to apply correctly)
- D: 5% (exceptional cases, possibly from oversights)

The final answer is: 

Error Analysis:
A) Incorrectly rearranging the volume formula, possibly by multiplying by \(\pi\) and mishandling constants.
B) Mistakenly omitting \(\pi\) from the denominator or incorrectly rearranging.
C) Correct application of the volume formula to solve for \(r\).
D) Incorrectly applying operations, possibly taking the cubic root of \(V\) separately.

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=45% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
