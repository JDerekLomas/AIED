Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student correctly multiplies both sides by $p$ to get $10p = 5$, then divides by 10 to get $p = 5/10 = 0.5$.
B) Multiplication error. The student identifies that there is a 10 and a 5 and assumes they must multiply them to find the variable ($10 \times 5 = 50$). This is often a result of incorrectly "reversing" the division without regard for the variable's position in the denominator.
C) Commutativity misconception. The student believes that $5 \div p$ is the same as $p \div 5$. They solve $10 = p/5$ by multiplying 10 by 5 to get 50, or more commonly, they simply see the numbers 10 and 5 and perform the division $10 \div 5 = 2$, ignoring the structure of the fraction.
D) Conceptual deficit. The student believes that because the "smaller" number is being divided to result in a "larger" number, the equation is impossible. They do not yet grasp that dividing by a decimal/fraction between 0 and 1 increases the quotient.
