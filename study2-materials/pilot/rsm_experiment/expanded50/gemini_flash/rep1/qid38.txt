Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer: The student correctly finds a common denominator of $2x$. They multiply the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 2 to get $\frac{8}{2x}$. They then correctly add the numerators ($3+8=11$) and keep the denominator as $2x$.
B) "Add across" error: The student simply adds the numerators ($3+4=7$) and adds the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). This is a very common misconception among students who do not understand the requirement for a common denominator when adding fractions.
C) Denominator neglect: The student successfully converts the second fraction to $\frac{8}{2x}$ and adds the numerators to get 11, but then makes an error with the denominator, either simplifying $11/2x$ incorrectly to $11/x$ or mistakenly thinking the common denominator should be $x$ and ignoring the $2$.
D) Adding numerators only: The student recognizes $2x$ as the common denominator but fails to adjust the numerator of the second fraction. They simply calculate $3+4$ to get $7$, resulting in $\frac{7}{2x}$.
