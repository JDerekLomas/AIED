Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student knows that 100 centilitres (cl) equals 1 litre (l) and correctly divides 650 by 100.
B) The student incorrectly believes there are 1000 centilitres in a litre. They have confused the prefix "centi" with "milli", leading them to divide 650 by 1000.
C) The student recognizes the 100 conversion factor but performs the wrong operation. Instead of dividing to convert a smaller unit to a larger one, they multiply $650 \times 100$.
D) The student incorrectly believes there are 10 centilitres in a litre (likely confusing "centi" with "deci") or they have performed $650 \div 100$ but made a decimal placement error, effectively dividing by 10 instead.
