Error Analysis:
A) The student calculates $2^5 = 32$ correctly but treats the negative sign in the exponent as a coefficient for the entire term, resulting in $-32$. They do not understand the reciprocal nature of negative indices.
B) The student correctly identifies that a negative exponent requires a reciprocal (the "1 over" part) but incorrectly carries the negative sign through to the final answer, believing that a negative power must result in a negative number.
C) The student treats the base and index as a multiplication problem ($2 \times -5$) rather than an exponentiation problem. This is a common "entry-level" misconception regarding index notation.
D) Correct reasoning. The student understands that $2^{-5} = \frac{1}{2^5} = \frac{1}{32}$.
