Error Analysis:
A) Students substitute 0.5 for $x$ instead of $y$, solving $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$. This gives $5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y = -4.16$ (roughly), but more commonly, they may simply add 6 to 30 then divide by 10, or make an additive error. However, 4.25 specifically stems from adding 6 times 0.5 ($10x = 30 + 3 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$) then accidentally adding another 10 or making a decimal placement error in a manual division.
B) This is often a "sign error" distraction for students who found a value near 4 but were confused by the subtraction in the original equation. They often assume $x$ must be negative to "counteract" the $-6y$ when equal to a positive constant.
C) This is the correct answer. Substituting $y = 0.5$: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$.
D) This is a common operational sign error. Students substitute $y = 0.5$ correctly but subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it when moving it to the RHS: $10x = 30 - 3 \Rightarrow 10x = 27 \Rightarrow x = 2.7$. This is the most common mistake for students who understand the substitution process but struggle with balancing equations.
