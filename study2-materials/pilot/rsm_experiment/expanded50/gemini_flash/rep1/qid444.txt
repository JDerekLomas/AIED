Error Analysis:
A) The student completes the calculation $1162 - 258 = 904$. They misinterpret "3rd digit" as the digit in the tens column (the middle digit) or mistakenly believe the number has 3 digits starting from the hundreds place, leading them to select 0 from the tens place.
B) The student correctly identifies the inverse operation needed but makes a decomposition error in the units column (subtracting 2 from 8 or failing to exchange), or they simply look at the units digit of the larger number ($1162$) and pick $2$ without calculating.
C) The student correctly identifies that the calculation is $1162 - 258$. In the units column ($12 - 8 = 4$), they mistakenly identify "3rd digit" as meaning the first digit they calculate (from right to left), or they make a borrowing error in the hundreds column leading to a $6$ in the result.
D) This is the correct answer. The student calculates $1162 - 258 = 904$. They correctly identify that a 3-digit number has its "3rd digit" (reading left-to-right as per standard convention) in the units place, which is $4$.
