Error Analysis:
A) The student performs the multiplication $15 \times 2 = 30$ but completely ignores the decimal places, or they may mistakenly believe that when multiplying decimals, you simply "remove the dots" and the answer is the resulting whole number.
B) This is the correct answer. The student multiplies $15 \times 2 = 30$ and correctly counts three decimal places (two from $0.15$ and one from $0.2$), moving the decimal point back three spaces from $30$ ($30.0 \rightarrow 3.0 \rightarrow 0.3 \rightarrow 0.03$).
C) The student likely matches the number of decimal places to the "longest" number in the question ($0.15$ has two places, so they provide an answer with two places: $0.30$, which simplifies to $0.3$). Alternatively, they multiply $15 \times 2$ to get $30$ and move the decimal only two places because they only counted the places in the first digit.
D) The student over-compensates for the decimal places. They might count the "0" in "0.15" and "0.2" as placeholders or simply believe that "multiplying makes things much smaller," adding an extra zero. They might also calculate $15 \times 2 = 30$ and then move the decimal four places instead of three.
