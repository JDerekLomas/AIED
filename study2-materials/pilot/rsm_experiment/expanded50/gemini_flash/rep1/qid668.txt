Error Analysis:
A) Correct reasoning: The student identifies that "mode" means the most frequent value. Since both 0 and 2 appear twice, the data set is bimodal, and both values must be listed.
B) Selection bias/recency: The student understands mode is the most frequent but only selects the largest value present, or simply picks the last number they see in the list that meets the criteria.
C) Confusion of averages: The student calculates the mean (sum is 4, divided by 4 is 1) or finds the median (middle of 0, 0, 2, 2). This is a very common "mixing up the M's" error.
D) Definition rigidness: The student believes that if there isn't a *single* winner for "most frequent," then no mode exists. They may have been taught that a mode must be "unique" or are confused by the equal distribution.
