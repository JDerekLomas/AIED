Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student correctly added the whole numbers (2+1=3) and the numerators of the fractions (1+2=3) while keeping the common denominator (5).
B) Incorrect Format. The student correctly calculated the sum as \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \), then correctly converted it to an improper fraction \((3 \times 5) + 3 = 18\). However, they failed to read the instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number."
C) Total Misconception. The student added everything horizontally: whole numbers were ignored or integrated incorrectly, numerators were added (1+2=3, which is ignored), and the most significant error is adding the denominators (5+5=10). This often results from a confusion with multiplication rules or a "add all the numbers you see" strategy.
D) Common Fractional Error. The student correctly added the whole numbers (2+1=3) and the numerators (1+2=3) but succumbed to the very common misconception that when adding fractions, you must also add the denominators (5+5=10).
