Error Analysis:
A) This is a "distractor by visual estimation." A student choosing 53° likely believes the diagram is drawn to scale and is attempting to guess based on the visual "sharpness" of the angle, or has performed a calculation error involving 180 (e.g., 138 + 42 = 180, then misremembering or subtracting another arbitrary value).
B) This is the correct answer. The student correctly identifies that vertically opposite angles are equal. Since the angle directly opposite \( p \) is marked as 42°, then \( p = 42^\circ \).
C) This student identifies that 138° and \( p \) are on the same intersection but fails to distinguish between vertically opposite angles and angles on a straight line. They see the 138° as the most "prominent" number and assume the larger-looking angles are equal to it.
D) This student likely suffers from "information overload." Because the diagram shows three lines intersecting rather than just two, they become confused by the third line. They might believe that the third line's intersection at a different point affects the properties of the first intersection, or they simply don't recognize the vertical angle pair in a complex diagram.
