Error Analysis:
A) The student believes that $\pi$ is rational because they associate it with its common approximations, such as 3.14 or 22/7, both of which are rational. They may also think that for the pair to have "neither" or "both" be rational, it would require a more complex relationship, picking the most "famous" number instead.
B) The student incorrectly believes that a fraction is rational by definition (misunderstanding that a rational number must be the ratio of two *integers*). They see the horizontal fraction bar and conclude that because it is written as a ratio, it must be rational, while recognizing $\pi$ as irrational.
C) The student makes both errors mentioned above. They view $\pi$ as equal to its rational approximations and view the reciprocal as a "fraction," therefore concluding both must fit the definition of a rational number.
D) Correct. The student understands that $\pi$ is a transcendental irrational number and that the reciprocal of an irrational number is also irrational.
