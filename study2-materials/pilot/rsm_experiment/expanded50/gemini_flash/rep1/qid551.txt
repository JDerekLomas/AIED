Error Analysis:
A) The student reads the protractor from one of the standard scales (inner or outer) without checking the alignment. If the protractor is placed such that the 0-180 line is horizontal but the angle is reflex (as indicated by the 240-degree mark), a student may mistakenly see 120 on the inner scale and assume Jo is correct. They fail to recognise that a protractor is usually a semi-circle (180°) and the angle marked exceeds this.
B) The student reads the scale from the wrong direction or focuses on the supplementary angle. If the protractor shows 120/60 on a standard dual scale, the student chooses Paul because they are used to measuring acute or obtuse angles and assume 60° "looks right" for a standard classroom geometry problem, ignoring the actual reflex orientation.
C) This is the most common misconception. The student sees both numbers (60 and 120) on the same line of the protractor scale. Because they don't know which scale to use (clockwise vs anti-clockwise), they assume both answers are mathematically valid depending on the "direction" you look from, or they believe the question is a trick.
D) The student correctly identifies that if the mark is at 240 degrees on a 360-degree protractor, or if the angle shown is reflex (greater than 180), then neither 60 nor 120 can be correct. This shows an understanding of angle magnitude and proper protractor orientation.
