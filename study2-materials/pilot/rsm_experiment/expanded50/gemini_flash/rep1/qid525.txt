Error Analysis:
A) The student successfully performed the calculation correctly to reach $4 \frac{19}{20}$ (or $\frac{99}{20}$) but failed to follow the specific instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number." They converted their final answer into an improper fraction or worked entirely in improper fractions and did not convert back.
B) This is the correct answer. The student found a common denominator (20), converted the fractional parts to $\frac{14}{20}$ and $\frac{5}{20}$, added the integers $(2+2=4)$ and the fractions $(\frac{19}{20})$ correctly.
C) The student attempted to find a common denominator by simply multiplying the two denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but then likely calculated the numerator correctly for twentieths (99) and placed it over 40, or made a combination of errors involving improper fraction conversion and doubling the denominator without doubling the numerator.
D) This is a classic "add across" misconception. The student added the whole numbers $(2+2=4)$, then added the numerators $(7+1=8)$ and added the denominators $(10+4=14)$. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the need for a common denominator.
