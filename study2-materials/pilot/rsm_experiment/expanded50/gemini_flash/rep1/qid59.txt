Error Analysis:
A) The student calculates $30\%$ of $40$ correctly $(3 \times 4 = 12)$ but forgets to add it back to the original $100\%$ ($40$). Alternatively, they confuse the process with a simple $30\%$ calculation because they are used to only working with percentages under $100$.
B) This is the correct answer. The student identifies that $100\%$ is $40$ and $30\%$ is $12$, then adds them together ($40 + 12 = 52$). Or, they use the multiplier method: $1.3 \times 40 = 52$.
C) This is an additive misconception. Instead of calculating a percentage of the amount, the student simply adds the percentage figure to the number given ($130 + 40 = 170$). This is common among students who struggle with the multiplicative nature of percentages.
D) This is a conceptual misconception. The student believes that percentages represent a "portion of a whole" and since a whole is $100\%$, they conclude that a percentage above $100$ is a mathematical impossibility or an error in the question.
