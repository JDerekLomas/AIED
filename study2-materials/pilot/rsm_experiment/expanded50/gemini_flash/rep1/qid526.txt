Error Analysis:
A) The student identifies only the summer months that are *above* the threshold (July, August, September) and provides that count, or they misread the 25°C line as the 29°C line and count the months above it.
B) The student incorrectly counts the months *above* the 25°C threshold. While only July, August, and September (3 months) are strictly above 25°C, a student might mistakenly include June (exactly 25°C) in their "above" count, or misread the y-axis scale, leading to a count of 4.
C) This is the correct answer. The student identifies January, February, March, April, May, October, November, and December as being strictly below the 25°C line.
D) The student fails to read the word "below" correctly and includes June in their count because it sits exactly *on* the 25°C line ($8 + 1 = 9$). Alternatively, they may struggle with the "greater than/less than" concept, assuming any value touching the boundary should be included.
