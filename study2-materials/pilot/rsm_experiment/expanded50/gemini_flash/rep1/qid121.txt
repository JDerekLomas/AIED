Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly assumes the gradient is simply the coefficient of $x$ (the $m$ in $y=mx+c$), regardless of whether the equation is rearranged. They fail to isolate $y$ and do not consider the signs or the coefficient of $y$.
B) The student recognizes that a rearrangement is necessary involving a change of sign for the $5x$ term, but they fail to divide by the coefficient of $y$ (3). They essentially calculate the gradient of $y = -5x + 15$.
C) The student attempts to rearrange the equation to the form $y=mx+c$ but makes a sign error during the subtraction phase. They correctly divide by 3 but arrive at $y = \frac{5}{3}x + 5$ instead of $y = -\frac{5}{3}x + 5$.
D) This is the correct answer. The student rearranges $5x + 3y = 15$ to $3y = -5x + 15$, then divides by 3 to get $y = -\frac{5}{3}x + 5$.
