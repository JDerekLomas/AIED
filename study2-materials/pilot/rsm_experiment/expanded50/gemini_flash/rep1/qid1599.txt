Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student understands that the vinculum (fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol, effectively replacing the parentheses, and that division is expressed as a fraction in algebra.
B) This choice stems from a "matching" error or over-compensation. The student likely sees the $+4$ at the end of the expression and assumes both variables must be balanced or modified by the constant, failing to recognize that $c$ is a lone dividend.
C) This is a hierarchy of operations/BIDMAS misconception. The student ignores the parentheses and applies the division only to the term immediately following it ($c \div h$), then adds the $4$ as a separate term.
D) This is a commutativity error. The student understands that division becomes a fraction but believes the order of terms is interchangeable (treating division like addition or multiplication), resulting in the divisor and dividend being swapped.
