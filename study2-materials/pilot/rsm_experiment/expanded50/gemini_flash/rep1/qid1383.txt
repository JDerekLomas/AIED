Error Analysis:
A) Correct application of the power and negative number rules. The student understands that $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$, noting that an even power of a negative base results in a positive product.
B) The student has confused the exponent with a multiplier. They have calculated $k \times 4$ (i.e., $-3 \times 4$), then ignored the negative sign or assumed distance from zero, resulting in $12$.
C) The student correctly identifies that $3^4 = 81$ but fails to apply the sign rule for even powers. They likely performed $- (3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3)$ or assumed that because the base is negative, the answer must remain negative regardless of the exponent.
D) The student has committed two errors: first, they multiplied the base by the exponent ($3 \times 4 = 12$) instead of using powers; second, they retained the negative sign from the base $(-3 \times 4 = -12)$.
