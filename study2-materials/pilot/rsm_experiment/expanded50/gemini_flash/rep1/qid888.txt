Error Analysis:
A) The student correctly multiplies the first terms ($m^2$) but treats the addition of $-5$ and $-7$ incorrectly, likely by finding the difference between 5 and 7 ($7-5=2$) rather than the sum. They also fail to apply the rule that "a negative times a negative is a positive," correctly calculating $5 \times 7 = 35$ but assigning a negative sign.
B) This is the correct answer. The student uses the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) method correctly: $m^2$, $-7m$, $-5m$, and $+35$. Combining the middle terms $(-7m - 5m)$ gives $-12m$.
C) The student correctly multiplies the numbers but struggles with directed number addition. They see two negatives and assume they should become a positive in the middle term (perhaps misapplying the multiplication rule to the addition part: $-5 - 7 \neq +12$).
D) The student correctly handles the addition of the middle terms $(-5 - 7 = -12)$ but makes a sign error in the final multiplication. They forget that $(-5) \times (-7)$ must result in a positive constant ($+35$).
