Error Analysis:
A) Misinterpretation of the word "and" or general confusion between addition and multiplication operations. The student may see "three lots of q" and think of it as a term, but mistakenly use a plus sign to connect $p$ to it, perhaps misreading "multiplied by" or simply defaulting to addition when they see multiple variables.
B) Misconception regarding indices (powers) vs. coefficients. The student correctly identifies multiplication is occurring but confuses the instruction "three lots of $q$" with "$q$ to the power of three" ($q^3$), a very common error in early secondary algebra where the "big 3" and "small 3" are used interchangeably.
C) Structural misplacement of the constant. The student understands that $p$, $q$, and $3$ are involved but fails to grasp that they are all multiplicative factors. They likely read "multiplied by $q$" then see "three" and add it at the end as a separate constant, rather than as a coefficient.
D) Correct application of algebraic notation. The student recognizes that "three lots of $q$" is $3q$ and that "multiplied by $p$" results in $3pq$, understanding that the coefficient is written first and that no operational signs are needed between variables.
