Error Analysis:
A) **Correct Answer.** The student correctly identifies the segments of the turn. From NW to N is 45°, and from N clockwise to S is 180°. 45° + 180° = 225°.
B) **Incorrect direction (anticlockwise logic) or subtraction error.** The student may have calculated the turn from NW to S anticlockwise (135°) and subtracted it from 360°, but then incorrectly performed the subtraction or confused the total rotation for a larger reflex angle starting from North.
C) **Anti-clockwise turn.** The student has identified the correct starting and ending points but has ignored the instruction to turn "clockwise," instead taking the shortest path (NW to W to SW to S), which is 3 x 45° = 135°.
D) **Generic half-turn misconception.** The student recognizes that S and N are 180° apart, or they have ignored the NW starting point and assumed a standard turn from North to South, or simply associated the cardinal opposite direction with a straight line (180°).
