Error Analysis:
A) The student replaces $y$ with 0 instead of $x$. They solve $4(0) + 2y = 10$, but then mistakenly multiply 4 by 5 (the correct value for $y$) and add it to something, or more likely, they perform $10 \times 2 = 20$, seeing the 10 and the coefficient of 2 and applying the wrong operation.
B) This is a "bond to 10" error or a confusion of coefficients. The student might see the 4 and the 10 and think $10 - 4 = 6$, then $6 \div 2 = 3$, perhaps influenced by looking at the $x=1$ column implicitly, or simply guessing a small integer that "looks right" in a sequence.
C) The student correctly substitutes $x = 0$ into the equation to get $4(0) + 2y = 10$, which simplifies to $2y = 10$. They then correctly solve for $y$ by dividing 10 by 2. This is the correct answer.
D) The student focuses on the coefficient of $x$ and the constant. They divide 10 by 4, perhaps forgetting the $2y$ term entirely or assuming the coefficient of $y$ is 1 and the 4 is what needs to be divided. They calculate $10 \div 4 = 2.5$.
