Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly applies the "rules for multiplication" to addition (negative and a positive makes a negative) and simply adds the absolute values of the numbers (11 + 7 = 18), resulting in -18. This is a common confusion between sum and product rules.
B) This is the correct answer. The student understands that they are starting at -11 on a number line and moving 7 units to the right, or they recognize they must find the difference between 11 and 7 and keep the sign of the number with the larger absolute value.
C) The student likely makes a basic arithmetic/counting error while attempting the correct process. They may be counting on their fingers from -11 and inclusive of the starting number, or simply miscalculating $11 - 7$ as 5.
D) The student ignores the negative sign entirely, treating the calculation as $11 + 7$, or mistakenly believes that "two negatives make a positive" and applies it incorrectly to the single negative sign present.
