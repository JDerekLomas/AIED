Error Analysis:
A) The student is ordering based on the value of the denominator only, treating larger denominators as larger values (or the numerator and denominator together as an integer). This is a common misconception where students apply whole-number ordering logic to fractions (e.g., seeing 12 as the biggest number). Alternatively, they may have ordered them from largest to smallest by mistake.
B) The student lacks a systematic approach to common denominators. They likely recognize $1/2$ and $3/4$ are "bigger" than the others but have failed to compare the specific values correctly, perhaps ordering by numerators first then by denominators, or simply guessing based on visual density.
C) Correct reasoning. The student converted all fractions to a common denominator (1/12, 4/12, 6/12, 9/12) or has a strong conceptual understanding of the "gap" to one whole and the size of unit fractions.
D) The student is "Denominator-Centric" but in an inconsistent way. They may have identified 12 as the "biggest" number and 2 as the "smallest" and tried to place them at the start and end, or they have correctly identified the smallest ($1/12$) and largest ($3/4$) but are confused about the middle values.
