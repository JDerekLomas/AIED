Error Analysis:
A) The student identifies the first coefficient (8) and simply takes it as the highest common factor without checking if it divides into the second term (10). They likely view factorising as just "pulling out the first number" rather than finding the HCF.
B) This is the correct answer. The student identifies 2 as the highest common factor of 8 and 10, then correctly calculates $8 \div 2 = 4$ for the triangle.
C) The student has confused factorising with finding two numbers that sum to 8 (5 + 3) or has misunderstood the relationship between the coefficients and the brackets entirely, possibly picking numbers based on their relationship to the constant term (10) but applying them to the wrong positions.
D) The student has successfully divided 8 by 4 to get 2, but has treated 4 as the factor for the star. While $4 \times 2 = 8$, 4 is not a factor of 10. They have prioritised making the first term work without checking the feasibility of the second term.
