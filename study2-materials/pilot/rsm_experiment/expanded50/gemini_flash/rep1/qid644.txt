Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student correctly identifies that they need to multiply -1 and -4, recognizing that "negative times negative equals positive."
B) The student correctly identifies that $1 \times 4 = 4$, but has a common misconception regarding directed numbers, failing to apply the rule that multiplying two negatives produces a positive result.
C) The student has confused the operation required. Instead of multiplying the terms as required by the expansion of brackets, they have added the two values: $-1 + (-4) = -5$, and then either ignored the sign or made a sign error to get $+5$.
D) The student has added the terms instead of multiplying them. This is a very common error for students who see "brackets" and instinctively think about collecting like terms or simple addition of the constant integers shown.
