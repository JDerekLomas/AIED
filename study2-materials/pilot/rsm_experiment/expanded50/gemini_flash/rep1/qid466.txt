Error Analysis:
A) The student correctly identifies the reciprocal (flipping the fraction) but makes a sign error. They may believe that "reciprocal" means changing to the opposite sign, or they might think that since the answer is negative, the multiplier must be positive (forgetting that negative times positive is negative).
B) This is the correct answer. The student recognizes that to get a product of 1, they must multiply by the reciprocal, and to maintain a negative result, they must multiply by a positive. Therefore, $(-3/4) \times (4/3) = -12/12 = -1$.
C) The student lacks the concept of a reciprocal. They choose the absolute value of the original fraction, perhaps thinking that to "get to -1" from -3/4, they just need to remove the negative or add a similar value. It reflects a total lack of understanding of multiplicative inverses.
D) The student chooses the same number as provided in the question. This often happens when students are confused by the structure of the equation and guess based on visual familiarity, or they confuse the rule for getting +1 (squaring the value roughly) with getting -1.
