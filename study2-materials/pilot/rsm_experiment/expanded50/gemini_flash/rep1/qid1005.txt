Error Analysis:
A) The student identifies that there is a '5' in the fraction and associates it with 0.5, likely confusing 3/5 with 1/2 (the most common fraction/decimal equivalence taught). They prioritize the presence of the digit 5 over its positional value.
B) The student uses "place value transposition." They see a '3' in the numerator and assume it simply translates to the first decimal place (0.3). This is a common error for students who do not understand the denominator’s role in division or scale.
C) The student treats the fraction as a string of digits to be combined. They take the 3 and the 5 and place them side-by-side after the decimal point (3 and 5 becoming 0.35).
D) The student may correctly calculate the answer as 0.6. Since 0.6 is not listed as option A, B, or C, they correctly identify that the answer is "None of these."
