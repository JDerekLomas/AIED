Error Analysis:
A) The student believes operations should always be performed strictly from left to right, regardless of operator type. They ignore the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule for multiplication over addition in Problem Q.
B) This is the correct mathematical procedure. In Problem P, addition and subtraction have equal priority, so we work from left to right. In Problem Q, multiplication takes priority over addition.
C) This student has two misconceptions: 1) In Problem P, they believe 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, so they must add before they subtract. 2) In Problem Q, they work strictly left to right, ignoring order of operations.
D) The student follows the literal acronym of BIDMAS/BODMAS too strictly for Problem P, believing that addition must always precede subtraction even when they carry equal priority. They correctly identify the priority of multiplication in Problem Q.
