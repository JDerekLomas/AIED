Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly performs the operation $12 \div 3$ rather than $1/12 \div 3$. They see the numbers 3 and 12 and intuitively apply the division inverse but place the result back into a fraction as $1/4$ or simply misunderstand the relationship between the coefficient and the denominator.
B) This is the correct answer. The student correctly applies the inverse operation, dividing both sides by 3 ($p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3$), which is equivalent to $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$.
C) The student ignores the fractional nature of $1/12$ or treats the equation as $12 \div 3 = p$. They perform $12 \div 3$ to get 4, reflecting a total loss of place value or a complete misunderstanding of the structure of the equation.
D) The student mistakenly subtracts 3 from 12 or treats the equation as $3 \times p = 1/ (12 - 3)$. Alternatively, they may have confused $3 \times 3$ and applied it to the denominator in an attempt to "move" the 3.
