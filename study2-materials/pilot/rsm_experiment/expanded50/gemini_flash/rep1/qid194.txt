Error Analysis:
A) The student is confusing "mean" with "median." They have identified the middle value in the ordered list (7) rather than calculating the average.
B) The student is confusing "mean" with "mode." They have identified the most frequent value in the data set (9).
C) The student has performed the first step of the calculation (summing the numbers: $1+4+7+9+9 = 30$) but has forgotten to divide by the count of numbers ($n=5$).
D) Correct answer ($30 \div 5 = 6$).
