Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly performs the inversion of the fraction $4/3$. Instead of multiplying by the reciprocal ($3/4$), they multiply $V$ by the original fraction $4/3$. They also fail to recognize that $\pi$ is in the numerator of the original formula, treating it as if it belongs in the numerator of the result.
B) The student correctly identifies that $\pi$ should be in the denominator, but they have inverted the fraction $3/4$ incorrectly or failed to multiply by 3, simply bringing the $4/3$ coefficient across as $4/3$ without reciprocal division.
C) Correct. The student successfully rearranged $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ by multiplying by 3, dividing by $4\pi$, and taking the cube root.
D) The student demonstrates several algebraic errors: they take the cube root of $V$ first but fail to take the cube root of the numerical constants. They also misapply the order of operations and "move" the constants $4$ and $\pi$ without acknowledging they are part of the cube root operation, often confused with the formula for the volume of a sphere rather than the radius.
