Error Analysis:
A) Correct application of BIDMAS (Order of Operations). The student calculates the left side as $8 + (12 \div 4) = 11$ and the right side as $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 5$. Since $11 > 5$, they correctly choose A.
B) The student incorrectly performs the operations on the left side from left to right (Addition before Division), calculating $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 5$. On the right side, they calculate $20 \div 4 = 5$. They likely believe both sides are equal but, being confused or having misread the signs, select 'less than' erroneously, or more likely, they perform a calculation error on the right (e.g., $12 \div 4 = 3$, $8+3=11$, then misjudge the inequality direction).
C) This is the most common misconception. The student ignores the impact of brackets or assumes the order of operations is always left-to-right regardless of operators. They calculate $8+12=20$, $20 \div 4 = 5$ on the left, and $8+12=20$, $20 \div 4 = 5$ on the right. Seeing $5 = 5$, they choose C.
D) The student recognizes that the left side is larger or equal to the right side but lacks the confidence or precision to identify the strict inequality. Alternatively, they use D as a "safe" guess when they can see the numbers are similar but aren't certain about the rules of precedence.
