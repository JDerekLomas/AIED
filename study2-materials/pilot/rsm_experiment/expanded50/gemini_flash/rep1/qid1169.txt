Error Analysis:
A) The student interprets "100 more" as a multiplicative relationship rather than additive. They have multiplied the original number by 100, effectively shifting all digits two places to the left and adding two placeholders.
B) The student incorrectly identifies the place value column. Instead of adding 1 to the hundreds column (9), they have added 1 to the thousands column (8), changing it to 9. This shows a confusion between "100 more" and "1,000 more".
C) This is a subtraction error. The student has interpreted "100 more" but actually subtracted 900 from the number (or replaced the hundreds digit with a zero), failing to understand the additive process or misreading the question as finding a difference.
D) This is the correct answer. The student identifies the 9 in the hundreds column, adds 1 to make 10 hundreds, which involves regrouping (carrying) 1 into the thousands column.
