Error Analysis:
A) The student correctly calculates $(-3)^{2} = 9$ and $1 = 1$, but fails the "negative multiplied by a negative" rule when substituting into $-2x$. They calculate $-2 \times -3 = -6$. Therefore: $9 - 6 + 1 = 4$. (Note: Alternatively, some may do $9 - 6$ and then mistakenly subtract the $1$ to get 2, or make other minor arithmetic slips, but the $-2 \times -3 = -6$ is the primary conceptual trap).
B) This is the correct answer. Calculation: $(-3)^2 - 2(-3) + 1 \Rightarrow 9 + 6 + 1 = 16$.
C) This student makes a significant negative number error by treating $(-3)^2$ as $-9$. They calculate $-9 - 2(-3) + 1 \Rightarrow -9 + 6 + 1 = -2$. This shows a misconception regarding the squaring of negative numbers (often exacerbated by incorrect calculator use where $-3^2$ is entered without brackets).
D) This student likely interprets $-2x$ correctly but mismanages the $(-3)^2$ or simply executes a sequence of sign errors that leads them back to a "low" positive value. More commonly, they may have correctly identified $(-3)^2=9$ but then processed $-2x$ as just $-2$, or subtracted $2(3)$ instead of adding $2(3)$, calculating $9 - 6 + 1 = 4$.
