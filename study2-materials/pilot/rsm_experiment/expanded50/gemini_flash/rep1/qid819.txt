Error Analysis:
A) Correct application of the "subtracting a negative" rule. The student understands that subtracting a negative value is equivalent to adding a positive ($6 + 8 = 14$).
B) The student recognizes the numbers combine to make 14 but struggles with sign rules. They may incorrectly believe that because there are two minus signs in the question, the final answer must be negative (over-applying "negative and negative make a negative").
C) The student treats the calculation as a subtraction of positive integers ($8 - 6$) or correctly interprets "double negative makes a plus" but then performs $8 - 6$ instead of $6 + 8$. They may also be confusing the rule with addition ($6 + (-8) = -2$) but making a further sign error.
D) The student ignores the first minus sign and calculates $6 - 8$, or follows the rule for adding a negative instead of subtracting one ($6 + -8 = -2$). This is the most common misconception for students who struggle with the "double negative" rule.
