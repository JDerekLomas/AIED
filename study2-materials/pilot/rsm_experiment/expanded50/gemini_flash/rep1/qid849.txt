Error Analysis:
A) The student ignores the subtractive principle and the value of L. They see CC (200) + X (10) + L (50) + I (1) + X (10) and simply add all components (200 + 10 + 50 + 1 + 10 = 271). This represents a lack of understanding of "IX" and "XL" as combined units.
B) The student correctly identifies CC (200) and IX (9), but misinterprets XL. They treat X and L as additive (10 + 50 = 60), leading to 269. This is a very common error for students who understand the "IX" subtraction but forget that "XL" also follows the subtractive rule.
C) This is the correct answer. The student correctly identifies CC (200), XL (40), and IX (9).
D) The student correctly identifies CC (200) and IX (9), but interprets the "L" as 50 and mistakenly thinks the "X" before it is just a "10" to be added, but then fluctuates or thinks "L" is 50 and ignores the X, or interprets XL as 50 - 10 + 20. More commonly, they see the L (50) and just append the 9, forgetting the X entirely or miscalculating the subtraction (thinking 10 after 50 is 59).
