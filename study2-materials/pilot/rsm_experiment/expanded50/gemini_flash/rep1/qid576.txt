Error Analysis:
A) The student correctly identifies the first decimal place as the '8' but truncates the number instead of rounding. They ignore the next digit (5), failing to recognise that 5 or more means rounding up.
B) The student has confused "1 decimal place" with "rounding to the largest place value" or the first significant figure. They see the 3 at the start and round the entire number to the nearest ten-thousand.
C) The student makes a multi-step error: they attempt to round up because of the '5', but they increase both the integer and the decimal, or they misidentify the column entirely and somehow add 1 to the '8' while also bumping the units column.
D) This is the correct answer. The student identifies the first decimal place (8), looks at the second decimal place (5), and correctly rounds up the 8 to a 9.
