Error Analysis:
A) Left-alignment error. The student understands that numbers need to be stacked but lacks the concept of place value alignment. They have aligned the leading digits (the 1 in the hundreds column and the 2 in the tens column), which is a common error for students who read left-to-right and do not realise that calculation must begin with the ones/units.
B) Place value partitioning with incorrect column alignment. The student has expanded the numbers into 100, 20, 8 and 20, 6, showing an understanding of partitioning (often used in the "grid method"). However, they have stacked the partitions starting from the left, placing the "20" under the "100", incorrectly suggesting that these parts should be added or operated on together due to their visual position.
C) Place value partitioning with "logical" value alignment. The student has correctly expanded the numbers into 100, 20, and 8. Unlike option B, they have correctly aligned the "20" under the "20" and the "6" under the "8". While this shows a strong conceptual understanding of place value, it is not the standard formal layout for "long multiplication" (column method). A student choosing this likely confuses the grid method's logic with the vertical setup.
D) Correct formal column method alignment. This is the correct way to set up the problem for the standard algorithm. The units (6 and 8) are aligned in the right-most column, and the tens (2 and 2) are aligned in the next column over. This preserves place value throughout the calculation.
