Error Analysis:
A) The student confuses decimal places with digit manipulation or significant figures. In this case, the student likely tried to "round" each digit individually from right to left (8 rounds 2 to 3, 3 doesn't change 8...) or simply guessed based on the appearance of common rounding problems without understanding the place value.
B) The student has confused "3 decimal places" with "3 significant figures" (29.2) or, more likely, "rounding to the nearest hundredth" (2 decimal places) but miscounting or incorrectly applying a rounding rule to truncate the number early.
C) The student correctly identified the first three decimal places but "truncated" (chopped off) the rest of the digits rather than rounding. They failed to look at the fourth decimal digit (8) to decide whether to round the third digit (6) up.
D) Correct answer. The student identified the third decimal place (6), looked at the fourth digit (8), and correctly applied the rule to "round up" because 8 is 5 or greater, changing 0.156 to 0.157.
