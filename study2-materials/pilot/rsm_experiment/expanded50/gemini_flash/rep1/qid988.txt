Error Analysis:
A) The student believes that a ratio always involves a "simple" division or halves/quarters. They likely divided 360 by 6 (a common factor) to get 60, then subtracted from 360 to get 300. Alternatively, they may have misread the 2 as a 1 and the 7 as a 5 (summing to 6), or simply guessed a pair that "looked" like a common ratio division.
B) This is a "halving" and "digits" error. The student divided 360 by 2 to get 180, then struggled with the second part of the calculation, possibly trying to involve the number 7 or 51 through a mental arithmetic slip or by simply picking a distractor that started with half the total.
C) The student has used an incorrect additive method or a "difference" logic. They may have attempted to find numbers that have a difference of 60 (associated with the number 6 which they mistakenly derived from $2+7-3$ or similar). Most likely, this is chosen by students who believe the two parts must sum to a round number and didn't check if the ratio simplified to 2:7.
D) Correct Calculation. $2 + 7 = 9$ parts. $£360 \div 9 = £40$ per part. $2 \times 40 = £80$ and $7 \times 40 = £280$.
