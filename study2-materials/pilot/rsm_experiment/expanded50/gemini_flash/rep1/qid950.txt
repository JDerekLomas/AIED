Error Analysis:
A) The student identifies that 45 is a multiple of 5 and 9 (composite) and mistakenly believes surds must be prime or "unusual" numbers. Alternatively, they may confuse a "surd" with a "simplified surd," thinking $3\sqrt{5}$ is no longer a surd because part of it was a square number.
B) The student chooses this because 47 is a prime number. They confuse the definition of a surd with the definition of a prime number, or they assume the "weirdest" looking number must be the odd one out.
C) This is the correct answer as $\sqrt{49} = 7$, which is a rational number. A student choosing this understands that a surd is an irrational root.
D) The student fails to recognise that 51 is $3 \times 17$ (a common mistake, often mistaking 51 for a prime) and assumes that because it is an odd number and doesn't end in 5, it must be "non-square," yet they pick it arbitrarily as the "last one in the list."
