Error Analysis:
A) The student correctly identifies that Step 1 is correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$). They also correctly identify that Step 2 is incorrect because Isaac added 1 instead of subtracting it. Because they successfully spotted the error in Step 2, they select this as the only correct step.
B) This is a "blind reversal" error. The student likely miscalculates Step 1 (perhaps thinking $15 \div 4 \approx 1$) but looks at Step 2 and thinks "to get $k$ by itself, you must add the numbers shown," failing to see that $60 - 1 = 59$ is the correct inverse operation.
C) This is the most common misconception. The student recognizes that $15 \times 4 = 60$ (Step 1), but then experiences a "sign error" or "operation confusion" in Step 2. They see the $+1$ and instinctively add $60 + 1$ to get $61$ instead of applying the inverse operation (subtraction) to isolate $k$.
D) The student fails to recognize that multiplying both sides by the denominator is the correct first step in solving a fractional equation. They may mistakenly believe you should subtract 1 first or they simply miscalculate $15 \times 4$.
