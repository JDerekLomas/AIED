Error Analysis:
A) The student applies the power of 2 to the entire expression \((3x)^2\) rather than just the \(x\). They calculate \(3 \times 0.3 = 0.9\) and then square \(0.9\) to get \(0.81\).
B) This is the correct answer. The student follows the BIDMAS/BODMAS order of operations: square \(0.3\) first (\(0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09\)) and then multiply by \(3\) (\(0.09 \times 3 = 0.27\)).
C) The student confuses the exponent with a multiplier. They calculate \(3 \times (0.3 \times 2)\). They interpret the \(x^2\) as \(x \times 2\), leading to \(3 \times 0.6 = 1.8\).
D) The student makes a place value error when squaring the decimal or multiplying the result. They likely calculate \(0.3^2 = 0.9\) (forgetting that $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$) and then calculate \(3 \times 0.9 = 2.7\).
