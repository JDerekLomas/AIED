Error Analysis:
A) The student believes the only way to solve the equation is to deal with the constant term first (adding 5). While Tom's method is the standard approach, the student incorrectly assumes Katie’s multiplication method is mathematically illegal, failing to realise that a term-by-term multiplication across the entire equation is also valid.
B) The student incorrectly believes you must multiply by the denominator first to "get rid of the fraction." They correctly see that Katie multiplied 12 by 3 to get 36, but they have failed to notice that Katie did not multiply the $-5$ by 3. This indicates a misconception about the distributive property of multiplication over an equation.
C) This is the most common mistake. The student correctly identifies Tom’s step (adding 5) and recognizes that "multiplying by 3" is a valid operation for Katie's approach. However, they lack the procedural fluency to notice Katie's omission: she forgot to multiply the $-5$ by 3 (which should result in $x-15=36$). They see the "12" become "36" and the "3" disappear and assume it is correct.
D) The student may be overthinking the steps or lack confidence in basic inverse operations. They might think Tom should have subtracted 5 or that $12+5$ isn't 17, or they may be looking for the final value of $x$ and, finding neither line represents $x=51$, conclude both are "wrong."
