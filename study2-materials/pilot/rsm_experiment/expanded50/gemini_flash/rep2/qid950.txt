Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly identifies square numbers or factors. They may see that 45 is a multiple of 5 and 9 and conclude that because it can be simplified (to \(3\sqrt{5}\)), it is "rational" or no longer a surd.
B) The student confuses the definition of a surd with that of a prime number. They recognise 47 is prime and incorrectly assume that the square root of a prime number must be an integer, or they simply choose the number that looks "most different" in the set.
C) This is the correct answer as \(\sqrt{49} = 7\). A student choosing this incorrectly (in the context of being wrong) simply doesn't exist, as this is the correct response.
D) The student fails to recognise that 51 is not a square number. Because 51 is a multiple of 3 and 17 (and often mistaken for a prime), students may believe it is a "nice" number that will resolve into an integer, or they simply guess due to unfamiliarity with the 17 times table.
