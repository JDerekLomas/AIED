Error Analysis:
A) Correct solution. The student correctly multiplies by $p$ to get $10p=5$, then divides by 10 to get $p = 5/10 = 0.5$.
B) The student incorrectly applies the operation by multiplying the two numbers they see ($10 \times 5$). This is a common "number grabbing" strategy where the student assumes a division equation must require multiplication to solve, regardless of the position of the variable.
C) The student divides the numbers in the "easiest" order rather than the correct order. They calculate $10 \div 5 = 2$ instead of $5 \div 10$. This reflects a misconception that division is commutative or that the larger number must always be the dividend.
D) This is often chosen by students who are confused by the variable being in the denominator. They may believe that because "10 doesn't go into 5," or because they cannot see a whole-number solution, the equation is "impossible" or has no solution.
