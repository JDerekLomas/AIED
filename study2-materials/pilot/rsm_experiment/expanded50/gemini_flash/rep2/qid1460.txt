Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student knows that 100 centilitres (cl) equals 1 litre (l) and correctly divides 650 by 100.
B) This student likely confuses centilitres with millilitres (1000 ml = 1 l) but makes a further error by dividing by 1000 rather than 100, or they incorrectly think there are 1000 cl in a litre.
C) This student confuses the operation needed for the conversion; instead of dividing to convert a smaller unit to a larger one, they multiplied by 100. This is a common directional error in unit conversion.
D) This student likely thinks there are 10 units in the conversion (associating "centi" mistakenly with a base-10 shift similar to cm to mm, or just moving the decimal one place) and divides 650 by 10.
