Error Analysis:
A) The student correctly identifies that the reciprocal ($4/3$) is needed to reach a product with a magnitude of 1, but they fail to account for the sign. They likely remember the rule "negative times negative equals positive" but misapply it, or they believe that because the answer (-1) is negative, the multiplier must be positive.
B) This is the correct answer. The student recognizes that the product of a number and its reciprocal is 1 ($3/4 \times 4/3 = 1$) and applies the sign rule correctly: a negative multiplied by a positive equals a negative.
C) The student lacks understanding of reciprocals and is focused purely on the digits and signs. They may believe that multiplying a fraction by its positive self will result in a negative unit, or they confuse this with an addition/subtraction problem where adding $3/4$ to $-3/4$ would result in 0, incorrectly extending that logic here.
D) The student likely confuses the rules for multiplication with identity rules. They see a negative answer and a negative input and assume the "missing" part must be the same fraction. Alternatively, they may think that squaring the number (or multiplying by itself) is how you reach an integer result.
