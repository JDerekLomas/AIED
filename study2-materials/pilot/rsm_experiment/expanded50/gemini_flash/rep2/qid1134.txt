Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly applies a "rule" for adding negative numbers where they simply add the absolute values (11 + 7 = 18) and keep the negative sign from the starting number. They do not understand that adding a positive value moves the result toward zero on the number line.
B) This is the correct answer. The student understands that adding 7 to -11 involves moving 7 units to the right on a number line, resulting in -4.
C) This is an "off-by-one" calculation error. The student likely understands the concept of moving toward zero but miscounts the steps on a mental number line or struggles with the basic subtraction $11 - 7$, often confused by the visual similarity of $11 - 6 = 5$.
D) The student ignores the signs entirely, treating the question as a simple addition problem ($11 + 7 = 18$). Alternatively, they may mistakenly believe that "two negatives make a positive," applying a misremembered rule for multiplication to an addition context and assuming the final result should be positive.
