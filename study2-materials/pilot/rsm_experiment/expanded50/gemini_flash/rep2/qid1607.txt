Error Analysis:
A) The student correctly identifies that Step 1 is correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$). They also correctly identify that Step 2 is wrong because Isaac added 1 instead of subtracting it ($60 - 1 = 59$, not 61). This is the correct logical path.
B) The student incorrectly believes Step 1 is wrong (perhaps thinking they should subtract 4 first or that $15 \times 4$ isn't 60) but mistakenly believes Step 2 follows logically from Step 1 (accepting $60 + 1$ as the method to isolate $k$).
C) The student correctly validates Step 1 ($15 \times 4 = 60$) but then makes the same procedural error as Isaac in Step 2. This is the "operation inversion error"—the student sees $+1$ and instinctively performs addition again to move it, or simply fails to check the arithmetic of the second step.
D) The student likely struggles with fractions. They may think Step 1 is wrong because they believe the 4 should be subtracted from 15, or they misunderstand the order of operations in solving equations (trying to deal with the 1 before the 4).
