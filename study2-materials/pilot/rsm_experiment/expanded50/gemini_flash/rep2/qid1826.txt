Error Analysis:
A) The student believes that a negative exponent makes the final answer negative. They calculate $2^5 = 32$ and simply attach the minus sign from the power, resulting in $-32$. This is the most common misconception regarding indices.
B) This is a "double misconception" error. The student correctly identifies that a negative exponent creates a reciprocal (a fraction), but they still believe the negative sign from the power must be applied to the final result, leading to $-1/32$.
C) The student interprets the expression $y = 2^x$ as a linear multiplication: $2 \times (-5) = -10$. This is common among students who have not yet grasped the notation of index laws or are confusing $2^x$ with $2x$.
D) This is the correct answer. The student correctly understands that $2^{-5} = \frac{1}{2^5} = \frac{1}{32}$.
