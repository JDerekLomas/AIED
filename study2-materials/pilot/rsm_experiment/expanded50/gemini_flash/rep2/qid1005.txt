Error Analysis:
A) The student identifies the denominator (5) and assumes that any fraction with a 5 must be related to 0.5. Alternatively, they confuse the fraction with 1/2.
B) This is a common "digit-matching" misconception where the student assumes the numerator simply becomes the first decimal digit (e.g., 3/10 = 0.3, so they assume 3/5 = 0.3).
C) The student concatenates the two digits present in the fraction (3 and 5) to create the decimal 0.35, treating the fraction bar as a separator rather than a division operator.
D) The student correctly calculates that 3/5 is 0.6. Seeing that 0.6 is not listed as option A, B, or C, they correctly conclude that "None of these" is the right answer.
