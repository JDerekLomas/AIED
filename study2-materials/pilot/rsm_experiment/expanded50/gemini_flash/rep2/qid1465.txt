Error Analysis:
A) Correct application of BIDMAS/Order of Operations. The student multiplies first: $4 \times 2 = 8$. Then follows left-to-right addition/subtraction: $3 - 5 = -2$, and $-2 + 8 = 6$.
B) This results from performing the operations strictly left-to-right, ignoring the priority of multiplication: $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$.
C) This results from a "grouping" error where students mistakenly add the 5 and 4 before dealing with the other terms, often coupled with a sign error: $5 + 4 = 9$, then $3 - 9 = -6$, then $-6 \times 2 = -12$.
D) This is a common misconception where students calculate the subtraction last but fail to handle the negative sign correctly. They calculate $4 \times 2 = 8$, then they mistakenly "add" first as $5 + 8 = 13$ (because of the 'A' before 'S' in BIDMAS), leaving them with $3 - 13 = -10$.
