Error Analysis:
A) Misinterpretation of operation and "lots of": The student likely associates "lots of" with multiplication, but fails to understand how it combines with the initial variable. They may also confuse the structure of the phrase, reading it as "$p$ plus three $q$s" or simply misplacing the operator because they associate addition with grouping.
B) Confusion between multiplication and powers: The student correctly identifies the quantity of $q$ (three) but applies it as an index (exponent) rather than a coefficient. This is a common error when students are transitioning from numerical multiplication to algebraic notation involving repeated factors or coefficients.
C) Parsing error/operator confusion: The student sees the variables $p$ and $q$ and the number $3$ and essentially guesses at the arrangement. They likely interpreted "multiplied" for the $p$ and $q$ but treated "three" as an additive constant (+3) at the end of the expression.
D) Correct notation: The student understands that "three lots of $q$" is $3q$ and that $p$ multiplied by this quantity is written without an operator sign, combining to $3pq$ according to standard algebraic convention.
