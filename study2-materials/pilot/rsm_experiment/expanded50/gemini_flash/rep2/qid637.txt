Error Analysis:
A) The student ignores the decimal points entirely or believes that multiplying decimals makes the number larger as it does with integers ($15 \times 2 = 30$, leading to $3$ or simply $30$). They lack any understanding of place value in decimals.
B) This is the correct answer ($15 \times 2 = 30$, then move the decimal point three places to the left).
C) This is the most common error. The student counts the number of digits after the decimal in one of the numbers ($0.15$ has two) or mistakenly thinks that $15 \times 2 = 30$ means the answer must be $0.30$. They fail to account for the total number of decimal places across both factors (three places).
D) The student over-compensates for the "three decimal places" rule. They calculate $15 \times 2 = 3$ (missing the zero) and move the decimal three places, or they count the leading zeros and the $15$ as digits to jump over, resulting in an extra zero.

Predictions:
below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=65% C=30% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=4% D=1%
