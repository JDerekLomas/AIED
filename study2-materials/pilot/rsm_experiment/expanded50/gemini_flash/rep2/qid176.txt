Error Analysis:
A) The student correctly calculates $(-3)^2$ as $9$ and identifies that $-2x$ becomes $+6$. however, they likely made a mental arithmetic error (e.g., $9 + 6 - 1$) or more likely interpreted $-2x$ as $-2 - 3 = -5$ then adding $9$ and $10$. However, the most common route to 14 in this specific quadratic is a sign error on the final constant or a simple summation error: $9 + 6 = 15$ then subtracting the final $1$ instead of adding it.
B) This is the correct answer. The student substituted $x = -3$ correctly: $(-3)^2 - 2(-3) + 1 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16$.
C) The student makes a classic error with negative squares and signs. They calculate $(-3)^2$ as $-9$ (often a result of how it is entered into a non-scientific calculator or a lack of understanding that a negative times a negative is a positive). They then calculate $-2 \times -3$ as $-6$ (ignoring the double negative). Total: $-9 - 6 + 1 = -14$, but more commonly they simply do $-3 - 3 + 1 = -5$ or some variation of $x^2$ being $-9$ and then incorrectly combining the rest to reach a small negative number like $-2$.
D) This is a "precedence of signs" error. The student calculates $(-3)^2$ as $9$, but treats $-2x$ as $2 \times (-3) = -6$, and then applies the minus sign from the equation to a positive result, or calculates it as $9 - 6 + 1 = 4$. This shows they have not accounted for the double negative ($ -2 \times -3$).
