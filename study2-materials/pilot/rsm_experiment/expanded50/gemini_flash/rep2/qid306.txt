Error Analysis:
A) The student believes that operations should always be performed strictly from left to right, regardless of the operators involved. They have missed the hierarchy of BODMAS/BIDMAS, applying "addition/subtraction" correctly from left to right in P, but failing to prioritize multiplication over addition in Q.
B) This is the correct reasoning. In Problem P, when operations are of equal priority (Addition and Subtraction), we work from left to right. In Problem Q, Multiplication takes precedence over Addition according to the order of operations.
C) The student follows two misconceptions: 1) A literal interpretation of "A" coming before "S" in BIDMAS/BODMAS, believing addition must always be done before subtraction regardless of position, and 2) a left-to-right approach in Q that ignores the priority of multiplication.
D) The student consistently applies the "Literal BIDMAS" error to Problem P (performing addition before subtraction simply because "A" is before "S" in the acronym), but correctly identifies the priority of multiplication in Problem Q.
