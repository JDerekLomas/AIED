Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student correctly added the whole numbers (2 + 1 = 3) and the fractions (1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5).
B) Incorrect Format/Conversion Error. The student has calculated the correct value but converted it into an improper fraction ($18/5$) instead of leaving it as a mixed number as specifically requested by the prompt. Some students may also arrive here by converting to $11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$.
C) "Add Everything" Misconception. The student added the numerators ($1+2=3$) and added the denominators ($5+5=10$), while ignoring the whole numbers entirely, or they calculated the correct numerator ($18/5$) but then incorrectly added the denominators when considering the "whole" parts. This shows a fundamental lack of understanding of fraction addition and denominators.
D) Adding Denominators Error. The student correctly added the whole numbers ($2+1=3$) and the numerators ($1+2=3$), but mistakenly added the denominators ($5+5=10$). This is the most common misconception in fraction arithmetic at the secondary level.
