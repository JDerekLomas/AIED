Error Analysis:
A) Correct application of the "subtracting a negative" rule. The student understands that $6 - (-8)$ is equivalent to $6 + 8$.
B) Misconception regarding sign rules. The student identifies that two negatives are involved and remembers that "two minuses make a plus," so they add 6 and 8 to get 14, but then inappropriately applies the sign of the larger number (or the sign used in the calculation) to the result, resulting in -14.
C) Confusion between subtraction and addition rules. The student ignores the first negative sign and calculates $8 - 6 = 2$, or alternatively, they think the two signs "cancel out" into a single subtraction ($6 - 8$) but then switch the numbers to keep the result positive.
D) Misapplication of the "number line" movement or signs. The student correctly treats the double negative as a single operation but chooses the wrong direction, or calculates $6 - 8$ correctly as -2, failing to recognize the impact of the second negative sign entirely.
