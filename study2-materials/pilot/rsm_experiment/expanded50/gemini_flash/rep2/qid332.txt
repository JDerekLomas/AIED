Error Analysis:
A) The student believes only Tom is correct because they recognize the "balancing" method of adding 5 to both sides (\(12+5=17\)). However, they have a misconception about the distributive property of multiplication; they fail to realize that if you multiply the whole equation by 3, you must multiply the -5 as well as the 12. They see Katie's \(x-5=36\) and assume it is correct to only multiply the denominator and the result, failing to spot the missing \(-15\).
B) The student believes only Katie is correct. This is less common but usually occurs when a student prioritizes "getting rid of the fraction" first as a golden rule. They likely performed the calculation \(12 \times 3 = 36\) and didn't check the logic of the \(-5\), while simultaneously doubting Tom's addition because they think you *must* multiply before you can add/subtract when a fraction is present.
C) This is a common misconception rooted in poor algebraic fluency. The student correctly identifies Tom's "add 5" method. However, they also see Katie's "multiply by 3" and think "36 is \(12 \times 3\), so that must be right too." They fail to apply the multiplication to the \(-5\) term. They assume both operations are valid "next steps" without checking the rigour of the distribution.
D) The student might be overcomplicating the inverse operations or has poor mental arithmetic (e.g., thinking \(12+5\) is not 17, or \(12 \times 3\) is not 36). Alternatively, they may believe the only "correct" next step is to find a common denominator for the entire equation.
