Error Analysis:
A) Correct application of substitution and indices. The student recognizes that $(-3)^4 = (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$, understanding that an even power of a negative number results in a positive product.
B) Misconception of indices as multiplication. The student has calculated $k \times 4$ (i.e., $3 \times 4 = 12$) and has ignored the negative sign entirely, treating $k$ as 3.
C) Confusion regarding negative signs and brackets. The student calculates $3^4 = 81$ correctly but applies the negative sign at the end (mimicking how a non-scientific calculator or certain software might process $-3^4$ without parentheses), leading to $-81$.
D) Dual error: Misconception of indices as multiplication combined with an awareness of the negative sign. The student calculates $k \times 4$ as $-3 \times 4 = -12$.
