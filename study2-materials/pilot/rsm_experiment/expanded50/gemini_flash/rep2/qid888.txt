Error Analysis:
A) The student calculates the middle term correctly by summing $-7m$ and $+5m$ (mistakenly changing one sign) or subtracts the numbers ($7-5=2$) and attaches the negative. They also multiply $-5 \times -7$ but incorrectly decide that a "minus and a minus make a minus" for the constant term.
B) This is the correct answer. The student uses the FOIL method or grid method: $m \times m = m^2$, $-7m - 5m = -12m$, and $-5 \times -7 = +35$.
C) The student correctly identifies that two negatives multiplied make a positive ($+35$), but they ignore the signs when summing the middle terms, calculating $7m + 5m = 12m$ instead of $-12m$.
D) The student correctly calculates the middle term ($-5 + -7 = -12$), but makes a very common sign error with the constant term, believing that $-5 \times -7 = -35$. This is the most frequent distractor.
