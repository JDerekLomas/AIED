Error Analysis:
A) The student correctly identifies that there are 5 numbers in the data set and knows to divide by the count, but believes that because the number 0 has no numerical value, it can be omitted from the sum in the numerator.
B) The student knows the components of the mean (summing and dividing), but lacks understanding of the order of operations (BIDMAS). They believe that writing the expression linearly is equivalent to calculating the mean, not realising that without brackets, only the 7 is being divided by 5.
C) The student ignores the 0 entirely. They treat it as if it isn't part of the data set, thus summing only the non-zero digits and dividing by a count of 4. This is a common misconception where "nothing" (zero) is equated to "non-existent."
D) The student likely calculates the actual mean ($15 \div 5 = 3$) and, seeing that the sum $0+1+3+4+7$ is not explicitly written in Option A (despite it being mathematically identical), or seeing the lack of brackets in B, they conclude that the "perfect" formal expression is missing.
