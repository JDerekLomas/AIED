Error Analysis:
A) Correct application of BIDMAS/BODMAS. The student calculates the left side as $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$ and the right side as $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$. Since $11 > 5$, they choose the correct symbol.
B) The student likely follows the "left-to-right" error without considering the order of operations. They calculate the left side as $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$ (identical to the right side) but then perhaps perform a secondary error or misidentify the "less than" symbol. More commonly, they may over-compensate for the brackets on the right, assuming the presence of brackets always makes a value larger.
C) This is the most common misconception. The student ignores the priority of operations and assumes that because both sides contain the same numbers ($8, 12, 4$) and the same operations ($+, \div$), they must result in the same value regardless of where the brackets are placed or which operation is done first.
D) The student recognizes that the left side is larger (11 vs 5) but misunderstands the mathematical notation for strict inequalities. They may believe that because $11$ is "greater than" $5$, the $\geq$ symbol is a more "complete" or formal version of the $>$ symbol, or they may be guessing among the inequality symbols.
