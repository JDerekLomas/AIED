Error Analysis:
A) The student interprets "100 more" as a multiplicative relationship rather than an additive one. They likely associated "hundred" with "two zeros" and appended them to the end of the number (multiplying by 100), rather than adding 100 to the hundreds column.
B) The student incorrectly carries the one into the thousands place AND the ten-thousands place. After correctly changing 900 to 1000 (0 in the hundreds place, carry 1), they added that 1 to the 8 AND added another 1 to the 2, treating the entire front of the number as needing to "go up" by one unit.
C) The student has confused "100 more" with "subtraction" or simply cleared the hundreds and thousands columns incorrectly. They may have attempted to "add 1" to the hundreds column, caused a carry, but then replaced the 9 with a 0 and mistakenly reduced the 8 instead of increasing it.
D) Correct answer. The student identifies the hundreds column (9), adds 1 to make it 10, places the 0 in the hundreds column and carries the 1 to the thousands column (8 becomes 9).
