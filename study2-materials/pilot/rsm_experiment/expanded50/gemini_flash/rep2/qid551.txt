Error Analysis:
A) The student reads only the outer scale of the protractor, where the line aligns with 120. They fail to notice that the protractor is placed "upside down" relative to the baseline or that the angle being measured is reflex (240°), erroneously concluding Jo's 120° reading is valid.
B) The student reads the inner scale of the protractor where the line aligns with 60. This reflects a lack of understanding of reflex angles and the orientation of the protractor. They assume Paul is correct simply because they see the number 60 on the instrument.
C) The student sees both numbers (60 and 120) on the protractor scales. Lacking the conceptual understanding of how to measure reflex angles or how to orient a protractor, they conclude that both are correct measurements of the same physical position, misunderstanding that "size" refers to the specific rotation shown.
D) Correct reasoning. A reflex angle is clearly indicated, which is greater than 180°. A standard protractor measures up to 180°; looking at the scale (120/60) and adding it to the straight line (180 + 60 = 240) shows the angle is actually 240°. Since neither 60 nor 120 is 240, both Jo and Paul are wrong.
