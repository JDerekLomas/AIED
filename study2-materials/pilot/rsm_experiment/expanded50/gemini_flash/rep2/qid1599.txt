Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student understands that the vinculum (fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol, replacing the need for brackets and representing division where the dividend is the numerator and the divisor is the denominator.
B) Misinterpretation of the terms. The student likely thinks the constant (+4) needs to be distributed or applied to both the numerator and the denominator, possibly confusing it with operations on fractions or simply over-complicating the structure of the expression.
C) Order of operations/BIDMAS error. The student has ignored the brackets and applied division only to the terms $c$ and $h$, effectively treating the expression as $c \div h + 4$. They do not realise that the horizontal line in option A must group the $h+4$.
D) Commutative property error (Reversal). The student understands that division can be written as a fraction but believes the order is interchangeable, or simply forgets which term becomes the numerator and which becomes the denominator.
