Error Analysis:
A) The student completes the subtraction $1162 - 258$ correctly to get $904$. However, they misunderstand the term "$3^{\text{rd}}$ digit". They count the digits from left-to-right (Hundreds, Tens, Units) and identify the 3rd digit as the 4. They then confuse the digit itself with its positional place value or misread the question as asking for "how many 0s" or simply select a number they see in their working (the tens digit). Alternatively, they may have performed $1162 - 258$ and made a systematic error in the tens column ($6 - 5 - 1$ instead of regrouping), leading to $904$.
B) The student correctly calculates $1162 - 258 = 904$. They then misunderstand "$3^{\text{rd}}$ digit" as referring to the magnitude of the hundreds digit (the "3-digit number" part) but choose 2 because it is the "third" number mentioned in the prompt (258, 1162...). More likely, it is a placeholder error in subtraction where they do not exchange and instead calculate $11 - 9 = 2$.
C) This is a common "number grabbing" error. The student does not perform the inverse operation (subtraction) and instead looks at the original numbers provided in the prompt. They see the "6" in 1162 or the last digit of the result they are aiming for and select C without calculating the missing value.
D) The student correctly identifies the inverse operation ($1162 - 258$) and calculates the answer $904$. They correctly identify that the "3rd digit" refers to the units column (Units being the 3rd place value position when writing or the final digit). Since $12 - 8 = 4$, they select D. This is the correct answer.
