Error Analysis:
A) Students choosing 53° often mistake this for a multi-step geometry problem involving a triangle or parallel lines. They may perform an arbitrary subtraction (e.g., $180 - 127$ or similar) or simply pick a number that "looks" like an acute angle because they do not trust the "vertically opposite angles" rule in a complex diagram.
B) This is the correct answer. Students recognize that the lines are straight and intersecting, and that $p$ and $42^{\circ}$ are vertically opposite angles, which are always equal.
C) Students choose 138° due to a "linear pair" or "adjacent angle" misconception. They know that $138 + 42 = 180$ and mistakenly believe that $p$ must be supplementary to the 42° angle rather than vertically opposite to it. They apply the rule for angles on a straight line to the wrong pair of angles.
D) Students choose "Not enough information" because they are distracted by the third intersecting line. They feel that without knowing an angle on the third line or having parallel line indicators (arrows), the diagram is "incomplete" or a "trick question."
