Error Analysis:
A) The student identifies the points that are strictly *above* 25°C (July, August, September). This is a classic "opposite of intended" error, or simply a misunderstanding of the word "below."
B) The student incorrectly counts the months that have an average temperature of *at least* 25°C (June, July, August, September). By including the boundary value (June at 25°C), they identify 4 months, again looking at the wrong side of the threshold.
C) This is the correct answer. The student identifies January, February, March, April, May, October, November, and December (8 months). They correctly exclude June because its value is exactly 25°C, not *below* it.
D) The student identifies all the points that are 25°C or lower. This is the "inclusive" error. They count the 8 months below the line plus the 1 month (June) that sits exactly on the 25°C line.
