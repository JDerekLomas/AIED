Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student correctly identifies the segments of the compass (NW to N = 45°, N to S = 180°; 180 + 45 = 225°), or calculates five 45° "clicks" clockwise (NW $\rightarrow$ N $\rightarrow$ NE $\rightarrow$ E $\rightarrow$ SE $\rightarrow$ S).
B) The student incorrectly turns anti-clockwise (NW to S via W is 135°) and subtracts this from 360°, or they mistakenly calculate the reflex angle from S back to NW going clockwise. Alternatively, they may count 7 "clicks" instead of 5, confusing the direction.
C) The student ignores the instruction "clockwise" and finds the shortest path between NW and S (anti-clockwise). This is a common error where students assume the smaller angle is always the intended answer in bearings/turns.
D) The student recognizes that S is opposite N, but forgets that Ada started at NW. They equate a turn "to South" as automatically being a straight line (180°) regardless of the starting position, or they measure from W to S and add a generic "straight line" value.
