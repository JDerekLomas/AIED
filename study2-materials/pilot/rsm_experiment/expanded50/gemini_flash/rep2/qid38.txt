Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student identifies the lowest common denominator as $2x$. They correctly multiply the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 2 to get $\frac{8}{2x}$. They then add the numerators ($3+8=11$) and keep the denominator as $2x$.
B) This is the "add across" error combined with a denominator error. The student adds the numerators ($3+4=7$) and adds the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). This is a very common misconception among students who treat fractions like vectors or simply sum all components.
C) The student correctly identifies that they need to multiply the second numerator by 2 ($4 \times 2 = 8$) to add it to the first ($3+8=11$), but they either simplify $\frac{11}{2x}$ incorrectly by "cancelling" the 2 or mistakenly believe the common denominator should be $x$ instead of $2x$.
D) This is a partial execution of the correct method. The student adds the numerators ($3+4=7$) but keeps the "largest" denominator ($2x$) without adjusting the second numerator. They understand denominators must be the same to add, but forget to maintain the equivalence of the second fraction.
