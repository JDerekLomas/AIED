Error Analysis:
A) The student calculates $(3x)^2$ instead of $3(x^2)$. They multiply 3 by 0.3 to get 0.9, then square 0.9 to reach 0.81. This is a BIDMAS/PEMDAS error where the multiplication is performed before the index.
B) The student correctly calculates $0.3^2 = 0.09$, then multiplies by 3 to get $0.27$. However, they make a significant place value error or a "misplaced decimal" error. Alternatively, they may be thinking $3 \times 0.3^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. *Wait, actually B is the correct calculation ($3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$). If D is intended as the common distractor, B is the correct answer.* 
*(Self-Correction: Re-evaluating the options, 0.27 is the correct value. The question asks for the analysis of WRONG answers. Therefore, A, C, and D are the errors.)*
C) The student ignores the power of 2 and simply calculates $2 \times 3 \times 0.3$. They treat the exponent as a multiplier ($3 \times x \times 2$) or calculate $y = 6x$.
D) This is the most common error for this level. The student squares 0.3 and incorrectly gets 0.9 (calculating $0.3 \times 3$ or simply forgetting the decimal rule for $0.3 \times 0.3$), then multiplies 0.9 by 3 to get 2.7.
