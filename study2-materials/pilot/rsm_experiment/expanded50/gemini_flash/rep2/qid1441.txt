Error Analysis:
A) The student believes the number outside the bracket must be the same as the coefficient of the first term in the expression. They lack an understanding of the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) and assume that $8m$ simply becomes $8(1m)$, ignoring whether $8$ is a factor of $10$.
B) This is the correct factorisation. The student has correctly identified $2$ as the highest common factor of $8$ and $10$, and calculated $8 \div 2 = 4$ for the coefficient inside the bracket.
C) The student has likely confused addition/subtraction with factorisation or has made a significant arithmetic error. They may be looking for numbers that have a sum or difference related to the original coefficients ($8-3=5$ or $10-5=5$) without understanding the multiplicative relationship required.
D) The student has identified a common factor (2) but swapped the results or made an incorrect division. They may have divided $8$ by $4$ to get $2$ but placed the $4$ outside, or they might think the outside number should be a factor of $8$ but have not checked if it works for the term $10$ (since $10$ is not divisible by $4$).
