Error Analysis:
A) The student is ordering based on the value of the denominator only. They assume that a larger number in the denominator makes a larger fraction (e.g., seeing 12 as the biggest and 4 as the smallest) or they have simply reversed the entire correct sequence (ordering largest to smallest instead of smallest to largest).
B) The student lacks a systematic approach to common denominators. They likely recognize $1/2$ and $3/4$ are "simple" or "common" and place them first, or they are haphazardly grouping fractions without comparing their actual values. They may also be misled by the numerators in the first two terms ($1$ then $3$) before losing the logic.
C) This is the correct answer. The student likely converted all fractions to a common denominator of 12 ($\frac{1}{12}$, $\frac{4}{12}$, $\frac{6}{12}$, $\frac{9}{12}$) or used benchmark decimals/percentages to compare the values accurately.
D) The student is ordering based primarily on the value of the numerator. They see the numerators $1, 1, 2, 3$ and believe this represents an ascending order, completely ignoring the relative size of the denominators or the actual value of the proportions.
