Error Analysis:
A) The student ignores the subtractive principle and the value of L. They see CC (200), XL (interpreted as 10 + 50 = 60), and IX (interpreted as 1 + 10 = 11). They add these as 200 + 60 + 11 to get 271. This indicates a complete failure to understand that a smaller numeral before a larger one denotes subtraction.
B) The student correctly identifies CC as 200 and IX as 9, but they misunderstand XL. Instead of 50 - 10 (40), they mistakenly recall L as 50 and X as 10 and simply add them (60) or confuse it with LX. They then arrive at 200 + 60 + 9 = 269. This is a very common "mid-range" error where students mix up addition and subtraction rules for specific pairs.
C) This is the correct answer. The student identifies CC = 200, XL = (50 - 10) = 40, and IX = (10 - 1) = 9. Sum = 249.
D) The student identifies CC as 200 and IX as 9, but misinterprets XL. They likely recognize the subtractive rule exists but confuse the values of L (50) and C (100) or simply treat the "X" as 10 and "L" as a "placeholder for 50", leading them to a sum that feels right in the 50s range. More commonly, they confuse XL with a representation for 50 (dropping the X entirely).
