Error Analysis:
A) Correct reasoning: The student correctly identifies that the "mode" is the value that appears most frequently. Since both 0 and 2 appear twice, they recognise the data as bimodal and list both values.
B) Selection bias/Confusion with "biggest": The student may be conflating the mode with the value of the numbers themselves, choosing 2 because it is the "highest" of the repeating numbers. Alternatively, they may have only looked at the end of the list.
C) Confusion with Mean or Median: The student has calculated the mean (sum/count = 4/4 = 1) or found the median (the midpoint between 0 and 2). This is a common category error where the student performs a more complex statistical calculation instead of identifying the frequency.
D) Definition error: The student believes that if two numbers have the same frequency, they "cancel each other out" or that a mode must be a single unique winner. They do not understand that a dataset can be bimodal.
