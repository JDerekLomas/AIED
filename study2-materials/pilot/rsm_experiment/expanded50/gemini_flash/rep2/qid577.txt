Error Analysis:
A) The student believes that $\pi$ is rational because they associate it with its common approximation $3.14$ or $22/7$. They may understand that $\frac{1}{\pi}$ is irrational because it "looks" like a more complex fraction or results in a decimal beginning with $0.318...$, leading them to think only the base constant is the rational one.
B) The student incorrectly applies the definition of a rational number as "any number written as a fraction." Because $\frac{1}{\pi}$ is written in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, they assume it must be rational, overlooking the requirement that both the numerator and denominator must be integers.
C) The student likely holds both misconceptions mentioned above: they view $\pi$ as its rational approximation ($3.14$) and see $\frac{1}{\pi}$ as a rational fraction. Alternatively, they may think "rational" simply means a number that can be used in "real" calculations or exists on a number line.
D) Correct. The student understands that $\pi$ is a transcendental irrational number and that the reciprocal of an irrational number remains irrational.
