Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. This is obtained by doubling the first equation ($8x+2y=14$) and subtracting the second ($3x+2y=4$) to get $5x=10$, therefore $x=2$ and $y=-1$.
B) This is the "Subtracted the wrong way/Sign error" distracter. A student might try to eliminate $y$ but when subtracting $4-14$, they mistakenly calculate $10$ instead of $-10$, or they successfully find $x=3$ through a different manipulation but fail to substitute correctly, choosing a pair that "looks" right or satisfies only one equation ($3(3) + 2(-5) = -1 \neq 4$, but $4(3) + (-5) = 7$).
C) This error comes from an "Addition instead of Subtraction" misconception. The student scales the first equation to $8x+2y=14$ but then adds the equations together to get $11x = 18$. $18 \div 11 \approx 1.6$, but often students make a clerical error in division or use the coefficients $4+3$ and $7+4$ directly ($11x = 11$, leading to $x=1$) then drifting toward a decimal because the process felt "messy."
D) This represents the "Only substituted into one equation" or "Arithmetic breakdown" error. The student might find a pair that satisfies the first equation ($4 \times 10 - 33 = 7$) but fails to check it in the second. This appeals to students who use "trial and improvement" but stop after the first success.
