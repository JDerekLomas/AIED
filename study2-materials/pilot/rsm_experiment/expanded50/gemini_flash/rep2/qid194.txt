Error Analysis:
A) The student is confusing "mean" with "median." They have identified the middle number in the ordered list (7) rather than calculating the average.
B) The student is confusing "mean" with "mode." They have identified the most frequent number in the data set (9) rather than calculating the average.
C) The student has performed the first step of the algorithm (summing the numbers: $1+4+7+9+9 = 30$) but has forgotten the final step of dividing by the count of items ($n=5$).
D) This is the correct answer. The student summed the numbers (30) and divided by the total number of items (5) to reach 6.
