Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly performs the operation $12 \div 3$ instead of multiplying the denominator by 3 or dividing the fraction. They treat the $\frac{1}{12}$ as just "12" or subconsciously invert the relationship, thinking "What fits 3 times into 12?".
B) Correct answer. The student correctly divides both sides by 3, calculated as $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$.
C) This student makes two errors: first, they ignore the fraction $\frac{1}{12}$ and treat it as 12, and then they divide $12 \div 3$ to get 4. Alternatively, they may think $3p = 1/12$ means $p = 12/3$, losing the reciprocal structure entirely.
D) The student makes a "near-miss" calculation error or applies a false relationship. They may have mentally subtracted 3 from 12 instead of dividing/multiplying, or confused this with a problem where the denominator was 3 and they squared it (3x3).
