Error Analysis:
A) Left-alignment error. The student understands that numbers need to be stacked but lacks the fundamental understanding of place value columns. They have aligned the numbers to the "start" (the left), similar to how one might write text, incorrectly placing the tens under the hundreds and the ones under the tens.
B) Expanded notation misalignment. The student has attempted to partition the numbers into 100, 20, and 8, but has failed to maintain the vertical column structure for those partitions. By placing the 20 (from 26) under the 100, they are demonstrating a "left-to-right" bias rather than aligning values of equal magnitude.
C) Incorrect partitioning/Grid method confusion. While the columns are better aligned here than in B, the student is likely confusing the "Column Method" (standard algorithm) with a "Partitioning" or "Grid Method" setup. This shows some place value awareness (tens under tens) but a fundamental misunderstanding of the visual format required for the standard long multiplication algorithm.
D) Correct setup. The student has correctly aligned the units (ones) in the right-most column and the tens in the second column. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the importance of place value in standard formal algorithms.
