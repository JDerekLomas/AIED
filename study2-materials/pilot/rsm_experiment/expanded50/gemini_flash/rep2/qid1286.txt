Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly rearranges the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ by multiplying $V$ by both the numerator (4) and the coefficient $\pi$, essentially confusing the rules of division when moving terms across the equals sign. They correctly identify the cube root but fail on basic algebraic manipulation.
B) The student incorrectly moves the $\pi$ and the $3$ but fails to reciprocate the fraction correctly. They likely multiplied both sides by 4 and then divided by $3\pi$, resulting in $\frac{4V}{3\pi}$, failing to understand that to isolate $r^3$, one must multiply by the denominator (3) and divide by the numerator ($4\pi$).
C) This is the correct answer. The student successfully rearranged $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ by multiplying by 3 ($3V = 4\pi r^3$), dividing by $4\pi$ ($\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$), and then taking the cube root.
D) The student attempts to apply the cube root only to the $V$ rather than the entire expression. This often occurs when students treat the algebraic rearrangement as a sequence of disjointed steps rather than a single operation on the whole side of the equation. They also fail to properly handle the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ by simply moving the numbers to the outside.
