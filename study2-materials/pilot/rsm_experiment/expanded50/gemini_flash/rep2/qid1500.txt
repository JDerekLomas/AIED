Error Analysis:
A) The student confuses decimal places with digit manipulation or simply guesses. There is no mathematical logic here; they may have incorrectly added values or misread the number 156 as 267 due to visual processing errors.
B) The student rounds to 2 decimal places instead of 3. They correctly identified the digit in the second decimal place (5) and saw the following digit (6) was 5 or greater, rounding the 5 up to a 6.
C) The student truncates the number rather than rounding it. They correctly identified the third decimal place (6) but ignored the rounding rule, failing to look at the fourth digit (8) to decide whether to round up.
D) Correct answer. The student identified the third decimal place (6), looked at the fourth decimal place (8), and correctly rounded up because 8 is 5 or greater.
