Error Analysis:
A) The student believes the numbers must be "round" or simple multiples of the total. They likely tried to divide 360 by 6 (a common factor) rather than the sum of the parts (9). Alternatively, they may have correctly identified the total should be 360 but guessed at a familiar-looking 1:5 ratio instead of 2:7.
B) This is a computational and conceptual failure. The student likely divided 360 by 2 to get 180, and then performed an unrelated or incorrect operation to find the second value (perhaps subtracting 9 from 60 or miscalculating 360/7). They do not understand that the two parts must sum to the total.
C) The student has likely added the ratio parts (2+7=9) and correctly divided 360 by 9 to get 40, but then made a calculation error when multiplying (e.g., $40 \times 2 = 80$ became 100, or $40 \times 7 = 280$ became 260/160). This is a common "near-miss" where the student understands the process but lacks arithmetic fluency.
D) This is the correct answer ($2 + 7 = 9$; $360 \div 9 = 40$; $40 \times 2 = 80$; $40 \times 7 = 280$).
