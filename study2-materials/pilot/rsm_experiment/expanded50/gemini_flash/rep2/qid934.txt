Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly performs the operation $10 \times 2$ instead of dividing by 2, or they simply see the coefficients $4$ and $2$ and the result $10$ and assume the missing number must be $4 \times 5 = 20$ (misapplying multiplicative relationships).
B) The student incorrectly substitutes $x=1$ instead of $x=0$, leading to $4(1) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 6 \rightarrow y = 3$. This is a common "entry point" error where students ignore the first column because it contains a zero.
C) The correct answer. The student substitutes $x=0$ into $4x + 2y = 10$, resulting in $4(0) + 2y = 10$, which simplifies to $2y = 10$, so $y = 5$.
D) The student forgets the $+ 2y$ or incorrectly treats the equation as $4y = 10$ (perhaps swapping the coefficient of $x$ for the coefficient of $y$). Dividing $10$ by $4$ gives $2.5$.
