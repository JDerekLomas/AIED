Error Analysis:
A) The student successfully converted the mixed numbers to improper fractions ($27/10 + 9/4$), found a common denominator of 20, and added correctly ($54/20 + 45/20 = 99/20$). However, they failed to follow the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number." This represents a failure to read the final constraint of the question despite correct mathematical processing.
B) This is the correct answer. The student added the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and used a common denominator for the fractions ($14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20$), combining them correctly.
C) The student performed the correct numerator conversion/addition as seen in option A ($54 + 45 = 99$), but they made a common error when dealing with denominators: they added them ($10 + 4 = 14$) or, more likely here, multiplied them ($10 \times 4 = 40$) without adjusting the numerators proportionally, or simply failed to find a Least Common Multiple.
D) The student used the "add the tops, add the bottoms" misconception for the fractional parts. They added the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), then added the numerators ($7+1=8$) and the denominators ($10+4=14$). This is a very common intuitive error for students who do not understand the necessity of common denominators.
