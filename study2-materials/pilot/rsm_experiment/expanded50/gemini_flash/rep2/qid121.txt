Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly assumes the gradient is simply the coefficient of $x$ (the value of $A$ in $Ax + By = C$), failing to rearrange the equation into the form $y = mx + c$. They may also have a misunderstanding that the gradient is always the first number in the expression.
B) The student recognizes that the $x$ term must be moved to the other side of the equals sign, changing its sign to $-5x$. However, they fail to divide by the coefficient of $y$ (the 3), leaving the gradient as $-5$.
C) The student successfully rearranges the equation to isolate the $y$ term ($3y = -5x + 15$) and knows they must divide by 3. However, they make a sign error during the subtraction/transposition process, losing the negative sign.
D) Correct answer. The student successfully rearranges the equation: $3y = -5x + 15$, then divides by 3 to get $y = -\frac{5}{3}x + 5$, identifying $m = -\frac{5}{3}$.
