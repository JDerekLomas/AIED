Error Analysis:
A) This error occurs when a student incorrectly transposes the equation, changing the sign of the $10x$ instead of the $6y$. They solve $10x = 30 - 6(0.5)$, leading to $10x = 27$ and $x = 2.7$ (Option D), but then they make an additional sign error or confuse the term movement to arrive at a value of 4.25 by calculating $(30 + 6 \times 0.5) / 10 = 3.3$ and then mistakenly adding a different coefficient or simply guessing a "larger looking" decimal. However, more specifically, it often results from students calculating $6 \times 0.5 = 3$ and then adding it to 30 incorrectly or dividing 42.5 by a perceived coefficient.
B) This is the same as above but involves a directional error on the number line or an incorrect negative sign assigned during the division of the constant by the coefficient of $x$.
C) This is the correct answer. The student substitutes $y = 0.5$ into the equation: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, which becomes $10x - 3 = 30$. Solving for $x$, they get $10x = 33$, so $x = 33 / 10 = 3.3$.
D) This is the most common distraction. The student makes a sign error when moving the term $-6(0.5)$ to the other side of the equation. They treat it as $+3$ on the left and subtract it from 30: $10x + 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 27 \rightarrow x = 2.7$.
