Error Analysis:
A) The student calculates $30\%$ of $40$ correctly $(3 \times 4 = 12)$ but forgets to add it back to the original $100\%$ ($40$). Alternatively, they confuse the process for finding $30\%$ with finding $130\%$, assuming the "1" is a placeholder.
B) This is the correct answer. The student identifies that $100\% = 40$ and $30\% = 12$, and adds them together $(40 + 12 = 52)$.
C) The student misinterprets the percentage sign as an addition instruction. They simply perform $130 + 40 = 170$. This is a common error for students who struggle with the conceptual difference between additive and multiplicative increases.
D) This is a conceptual misconception. The student believes that $100\%$ represents a "full" limit and that any value above this is mathematically invalid or a trick question. This is common among students who only ever encounter percentages in the context of probability or shading shapes.
