Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student correctly identifies that $-1 \times -4 = +4$. They understand that the product of two negatives is a positive.
B) The student correctly identifies that $1 \times 4 = 4$ but makes a sign error. This is usually due to the misconception that if there are negative signs in the expression, the answer must be negative, or simply forgetting the "double negative" rule.
C) The student has performed an addition calculation instead of a multiplication, while also ignoring the signs ($1 + 4 = 5$). This is a common error in bracket expansion where students confuse the operation required for the individual terms with the operation used to simplify the final expression.
D) The student has added the two terms $(-1 + -4 = -5)$. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the distributive law, where they identify that the two numbers must be combined but use addition instead of multiplication.
