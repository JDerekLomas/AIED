Error Analysis:
A) Correct reasoning: The student correctly identifies that both 0 and 2 appear with the same highest frequency (twice each), making the data set bimodal.
B) Over-selection/Misidentification: The student may mistakenly believe the "largest" value is the mode, or they have discounted 0 as a "real" number that can be a mode. They identify a frequency of two but only apply it to the non-zero integer.
C) Calculation of the Mean: The student confuses the term "mode" with "mean". They sum the values ($0+0+2+2=4$) and divide by the number of terms ($4 \div 4 = 1$). 
D) Definition misunderstanding: The student believes that if two numbers have the same frequency, they "cancel each other out" or that a mode must be a single unique number. Because there is no single "winner," they conclude no mode exists.
