Error Analysis:
A) The student correctly identifies that the reciprocal is needed to result in a magnitude of 1 ($3/4 \times 4/3 = 1$), but they have a "sign error" misconception. They likely believe that since the answer is negative (-1), the star must be positive, forgetting that a negative multiplied by a positive stays negative.
B) This is the correct answer. The student recognizes that to get a positive product ($1$), they would need $-3/4 \times -4/3$, but because the target is $-1$, they correctly identify that only one negative sign should be present in the equation (already provided by the $-3/4$). Wait, correction: $(-3/4) \times (4/3) = -1$. Actually, **A is the correct answer**. If the question is $(-3/4) \times \text{star} = -1$, then the star must be **positive 4/3**. Therefore, B is the error. In B, the student performs "negative times negative equals positive," resulting in $+1$ instead of $-1$.
C) The student lacks the understanding of reciprocals. They see $-1$ and assume they need the "additive inverse" or simply think they need to multiply by a similar fraction to maintain the digits, but lose the negative sign.
D) The student confuses the property of 1 with the property of -1, or believes that multiplying a number by itself (or its identity) is how to reach -1. They might also be guessing based on the numbers already visible in the question.
