Error Analysis:
A) The student successfully finds the correct common denominator (20) and correctly calculates the numerator (99) by converting to improper fractions ($ \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} $). However, they have failed to read the final instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
B) This is the correct answer. The student identifies the common denominator of 20, correctly converts the fractional parts ($ \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20} $), and adds the whole numbers ($2 + 2 = 4$).
C) The student follows the process of converting to improper fractions ($ \frac{27}{10} $ and $ \frac{9}{4} $) and correctly calculates the sum of the numerators as 99. However, they lack the conceptual understanding of denominators and have simply added them together ($10 + 4 = 14$) or, more likely here, multiplied them ($10 \times 4 = 40$) without adjusting the numerators accordingly.
D) This is a classic "add across" error common in lower-ability sets. The student adds the whole numbers ($2 + 2 = 4$), adds the numerators ($7 + 1 = 8$), and adds the denominators ($10 + 4 = 14$). They have no grasp of the requirement for a common denominator.
