Error Analysis:
A) The student applies the squared term incorrectly to the entire expression rather than just the variable $x$. They calculate $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$. This is a failure to follow the BIDMAS order of operations, squaring after the multiplication.
B) This is the correct answer. The student follows BIDMAS, calculating $0.3^2 = 0.09$, and then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.
C) The student makes a multiplication error regarding indices, often confusing $x^2$ with $2x$. They calculate $3 \times (0.3 \times 2) = 1.8$. This is a very common misconception where "squared" is treated as "double."
D) The student performs the correct operation $3 \times 0.3^2$ but makes a decimal place error. They either think $0.3^2 = 0.9$ (forgetting that $0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01$) and then multiply by 3, or they calculate $3 \times 0.09$ and misplace the point.
