Error Analysis:
A) The student fails to understand the subtractive principle of Roman numerals. They see CC (200), XL (as 40 + 10 = 50 or misinterpreting L as 50 and X as 10 but adding them), and IX (as 1 + 10 = 11). They effectively treat XLIX as 60 + 11 or make a cumulative error where they mistake L for 50 and then simply add every individual numeral (100+100+10+50+1+10 = 271).
B) The student correctly identifies CC (200) and IX (9), but misinterprets XL. Instead of seeing XL as 40 (50 - 10), they read it as LX, which is 60 (50 + 10). This is a common directional "reversal" error.
C) This is the correct answer. The student correctly partitions the number: CC (200) + XL (40) + IX (9) = 249.
D) The student recognizes CC as 200 and IX as 9, but ignores the subtractive placement of the X before the L. They treat the L (50) as a fixed value and ignore the X entirely, or mistakenly believe XL represents 50. This leads to 200 + 50 + 9 = 259.
