Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student correctly adds the whole numbers ($2 + 1 = 3$) and adds the numerators of the fractions ($1 + 2 = 3$) while keeping the common denominator ($5$).
B) Format Error. The student has correctly calculated the sum ($18/5$) but has failed to follow the specific instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
C) Total Misconception. The student has converted the mixed numbers into improper fractions ($11/5 + 7/5$) but then incorrectly added both the numerators and the denominators ($11+7=18, 5+5=10$).
D) Denominator Error. The student has correctly added the whole numbers ($2+1=3$) and the numerators ($1+2=3$), but has incorrectly added the denominators together ($5+5=10$) instead of keeping the common denominator.
