Error Analysis:
A) The student believes the only way to solve the equation is to deal with the constant term first. They correctly follow the "inverse operations" rule to add 5 to both sides. However, they view Katie’s approach as incorrect because they fail to realize that if you multiply the entire equation by 3, you must multiply the constant (-5) as well. They think Tom’s way is the *only* rule-following way.
B) The student incorrectly applies the multiplication property of equality. They know they need to "get rid of the divide by 3" by multiplying, but they fail to distribute the multiplication to the -5. They see Katie's $x-5=36$ as valid because $12 \times 3 = 36$ and the $x/3$ became $x$, neglecting the requirement to multiply every term in the equation.
C) The student likely falls into the same trap as Option B but assumes that because Tom is "obviously" right, Katie must be right too if she used the other standard operation (multiplication). They lack the algebraic fluency to see that Katie’s specific line is missing the $-15$.
D) The student may have a weak grasp of inverse operations entirely, perhaps thinking Tom should have subtracted 5 (to get 7) or that the 3 and 12 should be divided. They may be overthinking the "correct next line" and looking for a specific format they've seen in a textbook that neither matches perfectly.
