Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly performs the calculation for the left-hand side by adding before dividing ($8+12=20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$). This leads them to believe $5 < 5$, but because they likely also see the right-hand side results in 5, they may have misread the symbols or felt that the left side felt "larger" due to lack of brackets, or more commonly, they correctly calculated the left as 11 ($8 + 3$) but mistakenly thought 11 was less than the right-hand result of 5. However, A is the correct answer (11 > 5).
B) The student correctly calculates the right-hand side as 5, but on the left-hand side, they ignore BIDMAS/BODMAS and work strictly left-to-right: $8+12=20$, then $20 \div 4=5$. Finding $5=5$, they might choose B if they perceive the bracketed side as "heavier" or if they make a further calculation error on the right. Most likely, they mistakenly think 11 < 5.
C) The student lacks knowledge of order of operations (BIDMAS). They perform the addition before the division on the left-hand side ($8+12=20$; $20 \div 4=5$). Since the right-hand side also equals 5 due to the brackets, they conclude that both sides are equal.
D) The student recognizes that the numbers are the same and perhaps realizes the left side is larger (11), but misunderstands the "greater than or equal to" symbol, thinking it is a more "complete" or "safer" version of the greater than symbol, or they are guessing due to lack of familiarity with inequality notation.
