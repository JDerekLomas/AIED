Error Analysis:
A) The student believes that a ratio always involves a "simple" division by an integer factor they find comfortable, like 6. Alternatively, they may have misinterpreted 2:7 as representing roughly 1/6 and 5/6 of the total, or they have simply guessed values that add up to 360 without checking if the ratio simplifies correctly to 2:7.
B) The student has likely divided 360 by 2 (the first part of the ratio) to get 180, and then performed a calculation error for the second part (perhaps subtracting a mismatched number from 360 or dividing by 7 and rounding incorrectly). This stems from the misconception that the first number in a ratio tells you what to divide the total by.
C) The student has calculated the parts as though the ratio were 2:3 or a similar structure, or they have attempted to divide 360 by 3.6. More likely, they have subtracted 100 from 360 to get 260 but then misread their own handwriting as 160. This is often a "gut-feeling" answer for students who know the numbers should be roughly in that range but lack a method.
D) Correct Method: The student adds the parts ($2 + 7 = 9$), divides the total by the number of parts ($360 \div 9 = 40$), and multiplies each part of the ratio by this value ($2 \times 40 = 80$ and $7 \times 40 = 280$).
