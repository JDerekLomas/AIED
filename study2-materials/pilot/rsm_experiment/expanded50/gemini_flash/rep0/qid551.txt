Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly reads the outer scale of the protractor which shows 120, ignoring that the zero line of the angle is starting from the right (inner scale). Alternatively, they may recognize the angle is obtuse and simply choose the larger number provided by Jo, despite the actual angle being reflex.
B) The student incorrectly reads the inner scale of the protractor which shows 60. They likely understand that the angle starts from the zero on the right but fail to recognize that the arc indicates a reflex angle (the exterior part) rather than the acute interior angle.
C) The student sees both numbers 60 and 120 on the protractor (since they sum to 180 on a semi-circle) and assumes both students must be "technically" correct depending on which way you look at it, completely disregarding the marked reflex arc.
D) The student correctly identifies that the marked arc represents a reflex angle. Since the interior angle is $60^\circ$ (reading the inner scale correctly), they calculate the reflex angle as $360^\circ - 60^\circ = 300^\circ$. Finding that neither Jo ($120^\circ$) nor Paul ($60^\circ$) matches this, they correctly conclude neither is right.
