Error Analysis:
A) The student identifies the number 5 from the denominator and assumes the fraction represents one half, or they associate any fraction with a "5" in it as having a .5 decimal equivalent due to common exposure to 1/2.
B) This is the "placeholder" misconception. The student ignores the denominator entirely and simply moves the numerator behind the decimal point (treating 3/x as 0.3), or they confuse the place value of the numerator.
C) This is a "combination" error. The student simply concatenates the numerator and denominator into a single decimal string (0.3 and 5 becoming 0.35) without performing any division or scaling to tenths.
D) This is the correct choice, as $3/5 = 0.6$. A student chooses this if they correctly perform the division $3 \div 5$ or scale the fraction to $6/10$, find that $0.6$ is not listed, and have the confidence to reject the plausible-looking distractors.
