Error Analysis:
A) The student confuses multiplication with addition. They see "three lots of q" and "multiplied by" but incorrectly associate the structure with $3p + q$ or simply treat the plus sign as a connector between the two distinct parts of the sentence without understanding algebraic product notation.
B) The student confuses multiplication with powers. They interpret "three lots of" or "multiplied by three" as an index/exponent, leading them to believe that the three belongs as a power of $q$.
C) The student misinterprets the phrase "three lots of" as "add three". They likely translate "p multiplied by q" correctly as $pq$ but treat the "three" as a separate term to be added at the end of the expression.
D) This is the correct answer. The student correctly understands that "three lots of q" is $3q$ and that multiplying this by $p$ results in the simplified algebraic form $3pq$, following the convention of placing the coefficient first.
