Error Analysis:
A) The student confuses decimal places with digit manipulation or "rounding up" incorrectly by changing the 1 and the 5. They may have attempted to round multiple digits sequentially from right to left, losing track of the place value, or they simply guessed based on the numbers "looking" larger.
B) The student has confused "3 decimal places" with "significant figures" or has rounded to 2 decimal places instead of 3. They looked at the third decimal place (6), saw it was greater than 5, and rounded the second decimal place up, stopping there.
C) The student correctly identified the first three decimal places but applied the "truncation" method. They simply chopped off the digits after the third decimal place (6) without looking at the next digit (8) to decide whether to round up.
D) This is the correct answer. The student identified the third decimal place (6), looked at the fourth digit (8), recognized that 8 is "5 or more," and correctly rounded the 6 up to a 7.
