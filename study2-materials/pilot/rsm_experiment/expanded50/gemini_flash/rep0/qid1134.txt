Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly applies the rule for adding negative numbers or misunderstands the sign, performing $11 + 7 = 18$ and then attaching a negative sign. This is a "sign ignoring" error where the student combines the magnitudes regardless of the directional nature of the integers.
B) This is the correct answer. The student understands that adding a positive number to a negative number involves moving "up" the number line or finding the difference between the absolute values and taking the sign of the larger number ($11 - 7 = 4$, then apply the negative).
C) This is a common counting error or "off-by-one" mistake. The student understands the direction (moving from $-11$ towards zero) but incorrectly includes $-11$ in their count or fails to bridge the zero correctly when visualizing the number line.
D) The student ignores the negative sign entirely, treating the question as a simple addition of two positive integers ($11 + 7$).
