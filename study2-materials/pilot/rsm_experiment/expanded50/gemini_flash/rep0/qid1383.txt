Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student correctly applies the substitution $(-3)^{4} = (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$. They understand that an even power of a negative number results in a positive product.
B) Misconception of powers as multiplication. The student has calculated $k \times 4$ instead of $k^{4}$. They have performed $(-3) \times 4$, but ignored the negative sign or assumed the "size" of the number is 12.
C) Sign error with exponents. The student correctly calculates $3^4 = 81$, but incorrectly believes that if the base is negative, the result must remain negative regardless of the exponent. Alternatively, they may have used a calculator without brackets (typing $-3^4$ which follows BIDMAS/BODMAS to mean $-(3^4)$).
D) Combination of errors. The student has incorrectly multiplied the base by the index ($3 \times 4 = 12$) and retained the negative sign from the base $k = -3$.
