Error Analysis:
A) The student believes operations should always be performed strictly from left to right, regardless of the operation type. They apply the correct convention for Problem P (equal priority operations) but fail to recognise the priority of multiplication over addition in Problem Q (ignoring BIDMAS/BODMAS).
B) This is the correct response. The student understands that for Problem P, where addition and subtraction have equal priority, they should work left to right. They also understand that in Problem Q, multiplication takes precedence over addition.
C) The student follows the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS too literally and inflexibly. For Problem P, because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym, they believe addition must be done first even though they share equal priority. For Problem Q, they default to a left-to-right approach, ignoring order of operations entirely.
D) The student follows the literal order of letters in BIDMAS/BODMAS for Problem P (thinking Addition must come before Subtraction) but correctly identifies the priority of Multiplication for Problem Q. This is a very common "over-correction" where students believe the acronym is a rigid hierarchy rather than a grouping of equal priorities.
