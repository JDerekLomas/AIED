Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly applies the operation of multiplication to the denominator. They likely think "divide by 3" means finding 12 ÷ 3, resulting in 4, and then placing that back into a fraction as 1/4. It represents a misunderstanding of how to divide a unit fraction by an integer.
B) This is the correct answer. The student correctly multiplies both sides by 1/3 (or divides by 3), calculating 1/12 × 1/3 = 1/36.
C) This student has two misconceptions: first, they inverse the fraction 1/12 to get 12; second, they divide that 12 by the coefficient 3 to get 4. Alternatively, they may simply see the numbers 3 and 12 and perform a division (12 ÷ 3) without regard for the reciprocal structure.
D) The student likely confuses the operation with subtraction or a common factor error. They may think $12 - 3 = 9$ and place it as $1/9$, or they are incorrectly manipulating the digits in their head, possibly mistaking the operation for $3 \times 3 = 9$.
