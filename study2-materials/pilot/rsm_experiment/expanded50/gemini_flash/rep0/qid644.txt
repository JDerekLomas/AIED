Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student correctly multiplies the constant terms: $(-1) \times (-4) = +4$.
B) Negative Sign Error. The student recognizes that $1 \times 4 = 4$, but applies the rules of directed numbers incorrectly, either believing that a negative multiplied by a negative stays negative, or simply focusing on the presence of negative signs in the brackets and carrying one over.
C) Addition/Operation Error. The student has added the absolute values of the numbers ($1 + 4 = 5$) instead of multiplying them. They have correctly applied the "two negatives make a plus" rule but to an addition sum.
D) Addition and Sign Error. The student has added the two numbers $(-1) + (-4) = -5$. This is a very common mistake for lower-ability students who confuse the process of expanding (multiplication) with the process of simplifying/collecting terms (addition).
