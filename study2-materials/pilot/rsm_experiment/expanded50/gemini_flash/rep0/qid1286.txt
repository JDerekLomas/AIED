Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly performs the algebraic operations to isolate $r^3$. Instead of multiplying by 3 and dividing by $4\pi$, they appear to multiply both sides by the entire fraction $\frac{4\pi}{3}$. This is a common error where students move a fraction to the other side of an equation without inverting it.
B) The student correctly identifies that they need to divide by $\pi$ and take a cube root, but they have failed to correctly invert the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$. They likely multiplied by $\frac{4}{3}$ instead of $3$ and then dividing by $4$.
C) This is the correct answer. The student starts with $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, multiplies by 3 to get $3V = 4\pi r^3$, divides by $4\pi$ to get $r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$, and finally takes the cube root.
D) The student understands the inverse operations needed (multiply by 3, divide by 4 and $\pi$) but applies them outside the cube root. They may have incorrectly attempted to "simplify" the expression or do not understand that the cube root must apply to the entire expression to isolate $r$.
