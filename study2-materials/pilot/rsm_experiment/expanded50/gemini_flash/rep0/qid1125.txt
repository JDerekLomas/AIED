Error Analysis:
A) The student aligns the digits starting from the left-hand side (the largest place value) rather than the right. This is a common "alignment" misconception where students treat numbers like words in a sentence, starting from the left. It demonstrates a lack of understanding of place value columns (Hundreds, Tens, Units).
B) The student correctly identifies the partitioned values of the numbers (100, 20, 8 and 20, 6) but fails to align them correctly by their relative place value. By putting 20 under 100, they are essentially preparing to multiply or add digits from different families (thousands/hundreds) incorrectly.
C) This represents a "grid method" style partitioning layout but without the grid. The student understands that 20 belongs under 20 and 6 belongs under 8 to keep tens and units together, but this is not the standard formal layout for "long multiplication." It shows some place value awareness but confusion over the formal algorithm requirements.
D) This is the correct setup. The student has aligned the units (6 and 8) in the right-hand column and the tens (2 and 2) in the second column, which is the necessary prerequisite for the column (long) multiplication method.
