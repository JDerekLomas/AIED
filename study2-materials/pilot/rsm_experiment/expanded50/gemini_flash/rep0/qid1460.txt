Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student knows that 100 centilitres (cl) equals 1 litre (l) and correctly divides 650 by 100 to get 6.5.
B) This student confuses the conversion factor for litres to millilitres (1000) or simply over-applies the decimal shift. They have likely divided by 1000 instead of 100, common among students who default to "kilo/milli" prefixes and forget "centi".
C) The student recognizes the number 100 is involved but performs the wrong operation. Instead of dividing to move from a smaller unit to a larger one, they multiplied by 100.
D) The student mistakenly believes there are 10 centilitres in a litre (confusing "centi" with the prefix "deci" or simply using the most common base-10 factor). They divided by 10 instead of 100.
