Error Analysis:
A) The student is confusing the "mean" with the "median." They have identified the middle value in the ordered list (7) rather than calculating the average.
B) The student is confusing the "mean" with the "mode." They have identified the most frequently occurring number (9) rather than calculating the average.
C) The student has performed the first step of the algorithm (summing the numbers: $1+4+7+9+9 = 30$) but has forgotten to perform the second step (dividing by the count of numbers).
D) Correct answer ($30 \div 5 = 6$).

Predictions:
