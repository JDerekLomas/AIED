Error Analysis:
A) The student is ordering based on the value of the denominator only, following the misconception that "a larger number means a larger value." They have sorted the denominators in ascending order (4, 2, 6, 12) or are viewing them as whole numbers, essentially reversing the correct order.
B) The student has likely only compared the first two fractions ($\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{3}{4}$) and the last two fractions ($\frac{2}{6}$ and $\frac{1}{12}$) independently. They may recognize that $\frac{1}{2} < \frac{3}{4}$, but then believe $\frac{2}{6} < \frac{1}{12}$ due to the "larger denominator equals smaller value" rule being applied inconsistently, or they are simply guessing after comparing the first pair.
C) This is the correct answer. The student successfully converts the fractions to a common denominator ($\frac{1}{12}, \frac{4}{12}, \frac{6}{12}, \frac{9}{12}$) or uses benchmark values (e.g., $\frac{2}{6}$ is less than a half, $\frac{3}{4}$ is more than a half) to order them accurately.
D) The student focuses on the unit fractions/numerators without considering the relationship between the numerator and denominator. They likely think $\frac{1}{2}$ is the smallest because 1 and 2 are the smallest numbers present, then move to $\frac{1}{12}$ because of the 1, showing a total lack of understanding of fractional magnitude.
