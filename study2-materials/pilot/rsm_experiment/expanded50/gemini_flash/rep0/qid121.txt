Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly assumes the gradient is simply the coefficient of $x$ (the $m$ in $mx+c$) without first rearranging the equation into the form $y = mx + c$. They fail to account for the $3y$ or the signs.
B) Similar to A, the student recognizes that the $5x$ must be moved to the other side of the equals sign (becoming $-5x$), but they fail to divide by the coefficient of $y$.
C) The student knows to divide the coefficient of $x$ by the coefficient of $y$, but they either forget to move the $5x$ to the other side of the equation or fail to recognize that the term becomes negative during the rearrangement.
D) Correct answer. The student successfully rearranges to $3y = -5x + 15$ and divides by 3 to get $y = -\frac{5}{3}x + 5$, correctly identifying $m$.
