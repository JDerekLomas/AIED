Error Analysis:
A) The student believes that $\pi$ is a rational number, often due to a common misconception that its decimal expansion terminates (3.14) or because it is frequently replaced by the fraction $22/7$ in calculations. They correctly recognize $1/\pi$ as irrational, but are mistaken about $\pi$ itself.
B) The student incorrectly applies the rule that "a fraction is rational." They understand that $\pi$ is irrational, but they believe that putting any number into the form $1/x$ automatically makes it a rational number by "definition" of a ratio. 
C) This student suffers from both misconceptions mentioned above. They likely associate the term "rational" with "common in mathematics" or "usable in calculations," or they mistakenly believe that because $22/7$ and $1/ (22/7)$ are fractions, the original symbols represent rational values.
D) Correct reasoning. The student understands that $\pi$ is a transcendental irrational number and that the reciprocal of an irrational number is also irrational.
