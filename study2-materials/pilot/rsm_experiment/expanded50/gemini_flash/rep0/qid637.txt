Error Analysis:
A) The student correctly identifies that $15 \times 2 = 30$, but ignores the decimal place value entirely. They treat the calculation as if it were integers and likely drop the trailing zero ($3.0$).
B) This is the correct answer. The student calculates $15 \times 2 = 30$ and correctly moves the decimal point three places to the left ($0.030$), simplifying it to $0.03$.
C) The student makes a common place value error. They may count only the two decimal places in $0.15$ or one decimal place in $0.2$, or they may calculate $0.03$ but "feel" it is too small, adjusting it to $0.3$. Often, they mistakenly believe that multiplying tenths by hundredths results in tenths or hundredths only.
D) The student over-compensates for the decimal places. They might count the three digits present ($1, 5, 2$) and add three zeros after the decimal, or calculate $30$ and move the decimal four places instead of three, possibly by double-counting the zero in $0.2$.
