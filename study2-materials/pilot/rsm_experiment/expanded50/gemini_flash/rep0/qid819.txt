Error Analysis:
A) Correct application of the "subtracting a negative" rule. The student understands that $6 - (-8)$ is equivalent to $6 + 8$, resulting in 14.
B) The student recognizes the numbers combine to make 14 but struggles with the sign. They may believe that because there are two minus signs in the question, the answer must be negative, or they are mistakenly applying the "negative plus a negative" rule to a subtraction problem.
C) The student ignores the signs and simply finds the difference between 8 and 6 ($8 - 6 = 2$). Alternatively, they may misremember the rule and think that "minus a minus" results in a standard subtraction.
D) The student processes the calculation as $-8 + 6$. They see a negative 8 and a 6 and perform a basic addition on a number line starting from -8, failing to account for the first subtraction symbol or misinterpreting the structure of the expression entirely.
