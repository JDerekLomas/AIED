Error Analysis:
A) Students choosing 53° often make a "visual estimation" or a "complementary error." They might assume the intersecting lines are part of a larger structure involving 90 or 180 degrees but perform a random subtraction (e.g., 138 - 85 or 180 - 127). It can also result from a pure guess or a misread of the 42° as 37°.
B) This is the correct answer. Students recognize that vertically opposite angles are equal.
C) This is a "supplementary error" or a "straight line error." The student identifies the angle $p$ as being on the same line as the 42° angle but fails to see that it is vertically opposite. Instead, they assume $p$ must be the supplement (180 - 42) rather than the vertical equal.
D) Students choosing this lack confidence in geometric theorems. They may see three intersecting lines and feel overwhelmed, or they may incorrectly believe that without knowing the specific slope or more angles on the third line, the vertical relationship at the intersection is unsolvable.
