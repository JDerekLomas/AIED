Error Analysis:
A) The student calculates $30\%$ of $40$ correctly $(12)$ but fails to add it to the original $100\%$, or they confuse "of" with "increase by" but only perform the first step of the calculation.
B) This is the correct answer. The student recognizes that $130\%$ is $1.3$, and $1.3 \times 40 = 52$ (or finds $100\%=40$ and $30\%=12$ then adds them).
C) The student performs an additive misconception. Instead of calculating a percentage of the amount, they simply add the numbers provided in the question: $130 + 40 = 170$.
D) This is a conceptual misunderstanding of percentages. The student believes percentages are limited to a "whole" and cannot represent values greater than the original amount, often confused by contexts like test scores.
