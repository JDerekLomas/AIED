Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student correctly multiplies both sides by $p$ to get $10p=5$, then divides by 10 to get $p=5/10=0.5$.
B) This is a "multiplication reflex" error. The student sees the numbers 10 and 5 and instinctively multiplies them ($10 \times 5 = 50$) because they do not understand how to manipulate a denominator variable, or they incorrectly think that to "get rid of the 5" they must multiply by it.
C) This is a "commutative division" misconception. The student performs $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$. They correctly identify that division is required but assume the larger number must be divided by the smaller one, or they treat the equation as $10/5 = p$.
D) This indicates a conceptual block regarding algebraic fractions where the unknown is the denominator. The student may believe that because "10 cannot go into 5", or because $p$ is "on the bottom", the equation is unsolvable or invalid.
