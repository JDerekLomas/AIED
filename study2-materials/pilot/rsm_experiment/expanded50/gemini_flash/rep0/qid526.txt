Error Analysis:
A) The student identifies only the months that are clearly *above* 25°C (July, August, September). They have fundamentally misread the inequality requirement ("below") or are counting the "peak" months instead of the ones requested.
B) The student likely identifies the months that are 25°C or higher (June, July, August, September). This is an inclusion error where they treat "below" as "at or above," or they have counted the points in the middle of the graph that appear to be on the higher end of the y-axis scale.
C) This is the correct answer. The student identifies January (18), February (20), March (21), April (22), May (23), October (22), November (20), and December (18). These 8 months are all strictly below the line for 25°C.
D) The student includes June in their count. Since June is exactly 25°C, this error stems from a misconception regarding "below" vs "less than or equal to." They may also be misreading the scale, thinking the point for June (positioned halfway between 24 and 26) is slightly under 25.
