Error Analysis:
A) The student correctly identifies that Step 1 is correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$). They also correctly identify that Step 2 is wrong because Isaac added 1 instead of subtracting 1. This is the correct logical deduction.
B) The student likely believes Step 1 is wrong (perhaps thinking you should divide 15 by 4 or subtract 4) but incorrectly believes Step 2 is a valid move from the previous line (failing to see the inverse operation error), or they are guessing.
C) The student recognizes Step 1 is correct but has a common misconception regarding inverse operations. They see "+1" and instinctively add 1 to the other side to "keep it balanced," resulting in $60+1=61$. They do not realize this is mathematically incorrect.
D) The student likely struggles with the initial rearrangement of a fraction. They may think you should subtract 1 before multiplying by 4, or they may have made a mental arithmetic error thinking $15 \times 4$ does not equal 60, thus dismissing both steps immediately.
