Error Analysis:
A) The student interprets "100 more than" as a multiplication instruction ($28,902 \times 100$). This is a common confusion for students who associate "more" with making a number significantly larger or who misread the operator entirely.
B) The student correctly identifies that the digit in the hundreds column needs to change, but fails to handle the "carrying" over to the thousands place. Instead of incrementing the 8, they increment both the 8 and the 9 (adding 1000 and 100).
C) The student identifies the hundreds column but performs subtraction ("less than") instead of addition. They remove the 9 hundreds to reach 28,002.
D) Correct answer. The student understands that adding 100 to 900 creates 1000, which requires incrementing the thousands digit (bridging the thousand).
