Error Analysis:
A) The student struggles with the signs when squaring a negative number or multiplying two negatives. They correctly calculate $(-3)^2 = 9$ but treat the $-2x$ term incorrectly. They likely compute $9 - (2 \times 3) + 1$, or they mistake the $(-2 \times -3)$ as being $+4$ or simply calculate $9 + 6 - 1 = 14$. It often stems from losing a sign during the multi-step substitution.
B) This is the correct answer. The student calculates $y = (-3)^2 - 2(-3) + 1$, which is $9 + 6 + 1 = 16$.
C) This error comes from two major misconceptions: first, squaring $-3$ and getting $-9$ (a common calculator syntax error or mental slip where $-3^2 = -9$), and second, mishandling the $-2x$ term. They calculate $-9 + 6 + 1 = -2$.
D) This is a "linear mistake" or a specific sign error. The student likely calculates $9 - 6 + 1$. This happens when a student substitute $x=-3$ into $x^2$, getting $9$, but then ignores the negative sign of the coefficient or the $x$ value in the middle term, effectively calculating $x^2 + 2x + 1$ or $(-3)^2 + 2(-3) + 1$.
