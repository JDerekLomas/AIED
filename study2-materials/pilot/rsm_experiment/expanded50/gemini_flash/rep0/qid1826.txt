Error Analysis:
A) The student calculates $2^5 = 32$ and then applies the negative sign from the power to the base result, believing that a negative exponent makes the entire number negative ($2^{-5} = -(2^5)$).
B) The student correctly identifies that a negative exponent creates a reciprocal ($1/32$) but also incorrectly carries the negative sign through to the front of the fraction, conflating the rules of reciprocals and negative coefficients.
C) The student ignores the index law entirely and treats the expression as a linear multiplication: $2 \times (-5) = -10$. This is a very common mistake for students who confuse base/power relationships with multiplication.
D) This is the correct answer. The student understands that $x^{-n} = \frac{1}{x^n}$, thus $2^{-5} = \frac{1}{2^5} = \frac{1}{32}$.
