Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. To find this, the student correctly equates coefficients (e.g., doubling the first equation to get $8x+2y=14$), subtracts to find $5x=10$, yielding $x=2$, and substitutes back to find $y=-1$.
B) This error stems from a mistake in the elimination process. A student may subtract the two original equations ($4x - 3x$ and $y - 2y$) without first matching coefficients. This gives $x - y = 3$. If they then guess values or incorrectly manipulate this into $x=3$ and $y=-5$ (which fits $x-y=8$ if they miscalculate signs), or simply make a subtraction error during the proper substitution method (e.g., $14-4=9$ instead of $10$), they arrive here.
C) This is the "Additive Error." Instead of subtracting to eliminate $y$, the student adds the equations: $11x + 3y = 11$. Alternatively, and more commonly, it represents a calculation error where $7-4$ is handled as addition or the division $5x=3$ (instead of 10) occurs, leading to $x=0.6$. It often indicates a confusion between when to add and when to subtract terms.
D) This represents an "Equation Manipulation Error." The student likely tried to use the substitution method but failed to distribute coefficients or misused the signs. For example, rearranging to $y=7-4x$ and substituting: $3x + 2(7-4x) = 4 \Rightarrow 3x + 14 - 4x = 4$ (forgetting to multiply $4x$ by 2). This gives $-x = -10$, so $x=10$. Substituting $x=10$ back into $4(10)+y=7$ gives $y=-33$.
