Error Analysis:
A) The student identifies 8 as the coefficient of $m$ and assumes it must be the factor outside the bracket ($\star$) simply because it appears first in the expression. They do not check if 8 is a common factor of 10. They likely believe factorising just means "putting the first number outside."
B) This is the correct factorisation. The student correctly identifies that the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of 8 and 10 is 2. By dividing both terms by 2, they correctly find that $8m \div 2 = 4m$.
C) The student is likely confused by the numbers in the expression or has made a subtraction/division error. They may be looking for numbers that add or subtract to 8 and 10, or they are guessing based on the number 5 being a factor of 10 and trying to find a pattern that fits.
D) The student has correctly identified that 2 is a factor, but they have swapped the roles of $\star$ and $\Delta$. They have divided 8 by 2 to get 4, but placed 4 outside ($\star$) and 2 inside ($\Delta$). They fail to notice that $4 \times 2 = 8$, but $4 \times \bigcirc$ cannot equal 10 using integers.
