Error Analysis:
A) **Correct Answer.** The student correctly identifies the start point (NW) and moves clockwise through North ($45^\circ$), East ($135^\circ$), and South ($225^\circ$). This is calculated as five $45^\circ$ increments ($5 \times 45 = 225$).
B) **Measuring Anticlockwise/Reflex Error.** The student likely measured the turn from S to NW clockwise, or incorrectly subtracted $45^\circ$ from a full circle ($360 - 45$). It suggests a misunderstanding of the labels on a compass or failing to track the total degrees past the $270^\circ$ (W) mark.
C) **Measuring Anticlockwise.** The student has calculated the angle turning **anti-clockwise** from NW to S (NW to W is $45^\circ$, W to S is $90^\circ$; $45 + 90 = 135$). This is the most common error as it represents the "shortest distance" between the two points, ignoring the instruction "clockwise".
D) **Visual/Cardinal Error.** The student assumes a "turn" implies a 180-degree flip or they are incorrectly identifying S as being directly opposite NW (confusing it with SE), or simply guessing a common "turn" number.
