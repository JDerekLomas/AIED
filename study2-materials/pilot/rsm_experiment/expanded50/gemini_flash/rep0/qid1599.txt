Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. The student understands that the vinculum (fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol, replacing both the division sign and the brackets.
B) This is an additive error. The student likely thinks that the "+4" within the brackets must be applied to both variables or is confused by the structure of equivalent fractions, leading them to balance the expression by adding 4 to the numerator.
C) This is a "Left-to-Right" operational error or a misconception regarding BIDMAS/Order of Operations. The student ignores the brackets and calculates $c \div h$ first, then adds the 4 separately, failing to see $(h+4)$ as a single denominator.
D) This is a "Commutative Misconception" or "Divisor/Dividend swap." The student understands that division can be written as a fraction but believes the order of the terms is interchangeable, placing the second term on top.
