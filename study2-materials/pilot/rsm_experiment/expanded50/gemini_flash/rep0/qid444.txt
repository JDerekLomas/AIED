Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly performs the subtraction $1162 - 258$. When subtracting $8$ from $12$, they correctly get $4$. However, they likely fail to adjust the tens column after "borrowing/exchanging" (keeping it as $6-5=1$) or make a mental arithmetic slip, arriving at a result ending in 0 (e.g., $1158 - 258 = 900$).
B) The student incorrectly adds the last digits ($8 + 2$) thinking the question asks what digit makes the sum of the units column a multiple of $10$, or they subtract $8-6$ and ignore the need to subtract from the total. It is a common "digit manipulation" error.
C) The student attempts to find the missing value by looking at the last digits ($8 + \text{_} = 2$) and incorrectly identifies the number as $6$ because they reverse the subtraction ($8 - 2 = 6$) rather than thinking about $12 - 8 = 4$.
D) This is the correct answer. The student correctly calculates $1162 - 258 = 904$. The "3rd digit" of a 3-digit number is the units digit, which is $4$.
