Error Analysis:
A) The student correctly identifies that the zero must be included in the count of numbers ($n=5$) but incorrectly assumes that adding zero to the numerator is unnecessary for the formal expression. While the numerical result is the same as the correct mean, this represents a subtle lack of rigor in showing the full summation process, or conversely, a savvy student who realizes $0$ adds no value to the sum but knows the count is still $5$.
B) This is a classic Order of Operations (BIDMAS) error. The student understands they need to add the numbers and divide by 5, but fails to realize that without brackets, a calculator or formal notation would only divide the final number (7) by 5. 
C) This represents a fundamental misconception regarding the number zero. The student excludes $0$ from the sum and also excludes it from the count of numbers, treating $0$ as "nothing" rather than a valid data point. They divide by $n=4$ instead of $n=5$.
D) This is the "Correct" answer for an observant student. Because $0$ is an element of the data set, it should technically be included in the numerator sum $(0+1+3+4+7)$ to represent the data accurately. Many students will choose this because they see B is notationally incorrect and C is conceptually incorrect, and A feels "incomplete."
