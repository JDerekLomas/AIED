Error Analysis:
A) Correct Answer. To add fractions with different denominators, students must find a common denominator (in this case, $2x$). They multiply the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 2 to get $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x}$, which simplifies to $\frac{11}{2x}$.
B) This is the "Add everything" error. The student adds the numerators ($3+4=7$) and adds the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). This demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of the requirement for a common denominator.
C) This occurs when a student finds the correct equivalent numerator for the second fraction ($8/2x$) but forgets the factor of 2 in the common denominator when writing the final answer, or incorrectly assumes the common denominator is $x$ and changes the first fraction to $3/x$ erroneously.
D) This is a "Numerator only" error. The student identifies the correct common denominator ($2x$) but fails to scale the second numerator. They simply add $3+4$ and place it over the common denominator $2x$, forgetting that $\frac{4}{x}$ must become $\frac{8}{2x}$.
