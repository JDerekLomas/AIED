Error Analysis:
A) The student identifies that 45 is a multiple of 5 or 9 (a square number) and confuses the ability to *simplify* a surd ($3\sqrt{5}$) with the definition of a surd. They may also wrongly assume that odd numbers ending in 5 are more likely to be square.
B) The student incorrectly identifies 47 as a square number or fails to recognize it as a prime number. They might also guess B because they do not know their square numbers past $6^2=36$ and assume all the numbers in the list are surds, choosing one that "looks" less common.
C) This is the correct answer ($\sqrt{49} = 7$, which is a rational number). A student choosing this has correctly identified the definition of a surd and knows their square numbers.
D) The student may believe that 51 is a prime number or a square number. Because 51 is often mistaken for a prime (the "Grothendieck prime" error), students often assume it has special properties and could be a square number if they are guessing.
