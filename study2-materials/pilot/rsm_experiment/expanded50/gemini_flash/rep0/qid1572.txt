Error Analysis:
A) The student incorrectly perceives the line of reflection as a vertical line (such as $x = -3$) or is attempting to measure a horizontal distance of 6 units from an arbitrary point. They may be counting squares horizontally from the $y$-axis to the line and doubling it, resulting in a "slide" rather than a reflection.
B) This is a "double flip" error combined with a sign error. The student remembers the rule for reflection in $y = x$ is $(y, x)$, giving $(3, 0)$, but then applies a sign change incorrectly to both coordinates or mistakenly reflects $(0, 3)$ across to a quadrant that feels "opposite" without following the $y = -x$ geometric rules.
C) The student has performed a horizontal reflection (using the line $x = -1.5$ or simply moving the point across to where it "looks" symmetrical horizontally). They have kept the $y$-coordinate the same and changed $x$ to match the width of the transformation, ignoring the diagonal nature of the mirror line.
D) Correct answer. To reflect in $y = -x$, the rule is $(x, y) \rightarrow (-y, -x)$. Applying this to $P(0, 3)$ gives $(-3, 0)$. Geometrically, the student moves perpendicularly to the line $y = -x$ and the same distance beyond it.
