Error Analysis:
A) The student correctly identifies the need to combine -5 and -7 for the middle term but makes a signed number arithmetic error during addition, essentially calculating \(-7 + 5 = -2\). Alternatively, they may have confused the rules for addition and subtraction, or simply guessed a smaller coefficient for the middle term.
B) This is the correct answer. The student correctly applies FOIL/Grid method: \(m \times m = m^2\), \(-7m - 5m = -12m\), and \((-5) \times (-7) = +35\).
C) The student understands that 5 and 7 sum to 12 and multiply to 35, but they fail to account for the negative signs in the brackets. They assume that because both numbers in the brackets are subtracted, the middle term might become positive through a misapplication of the "two negatives make a positive" rule to the addition stage.
D) The student correctly calculates the middle term (\(-5 - 7 = -12\)) but fails the multiplication of the constants. They likely believe that a negative multiplied by a negative stays negative, or they simply carry the sign of the individual terms through to the final product.
