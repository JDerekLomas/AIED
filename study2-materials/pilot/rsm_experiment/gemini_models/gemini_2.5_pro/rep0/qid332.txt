Here's my prediction based on marking many, many Year 9 papers.

### Teacher's Analysis

This is a classic question that tests a student's understanding of the order of operations when rearranging equations. It's not just about getting the right answer; it's about knowing the valid *processes*.

*   **Tom's Method:** He correctly identifies that the first step in the standard "balancing" method is to reverse the subtraction. He adds 5 to both sides: \( \frac{x}{3}-5+5=12+5 \), which gives \( \frac{x}{3}=17 \). This is correct.

*   **Katie's Method:** She attempts to eliminate the fraction first by multiplying by 3. A correct application of this would be to multiply *every term* by 3: \( 3(\frac{x}{3}) - 3(5) = 3(12) \), which leads to \( x - 15 = 36 \). Katie's line, \( x-5=36 \), comes from a very common error: she multiplies the first term (\( \frac{x}{3} \)) and the term on the right (12) by 3, but forgets to multiply the middle term (-5). This is an extremely "attractive" error because students often think "I'll just multiply the fraction and the other side." Katie is therefore incorrect.

*   **The Answers:**
    *   A) Only Tom: This is the correct answer.
    *   B) Only Katie: Chosen by students who make the common error above and don't see Tom's method as valid or check it carefully.
    *   C) Both Tom and Katie: This is a significant trap. Students will correctly identify Tom's method. Then they'll look at Katie's, make the common multiplication error in their head, believe it's also correct, and select C. This option will be very popular.
    *   D) Neither is correct: Unlikely, but could be chosen by very confused students or those who overthink and convince themselves both methods have a flaw.
