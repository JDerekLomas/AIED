Here is my prediction based on marking 200 Year 9 mock exam papers.

### Teacher's Analysis

**The Question:** \( 2 \frac{7}{10}+2 \frac{1}{4}= \). Leave your answer as a mixed number.

This question tests the addition of mixed numbers, which requires finding a common denominator. It also has a classic "read the question" trap.

*   **Correct Answer:** **B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \)**
    *   Add whole numbers: \(2+2=4\).
    *   Add fractions: \( \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20} \).
    *   Combine: \(4 \frac{19}{20}\).

### Analysis of Incorrect Options

*   **A) \( \frac{99}{20} \):** This is the correct answer expressed as an improper fraction. Students who choose this have successfully performed the calculation (likely by converting to improper fractions: \( \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} \)) but have failed to follow the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number". This is a common mistake for students who rush or don't check the wording of the question. It's an attractive answer because the numbers are correct.

*   **C) \( \frac{99}{40} \):** This comes from finding an incorrect common denominator. The student likely converted to improper fractions (\(\frac{27}{10}\) and \(\frac{9}{4}\)) but then found the denominator by multiplying the two denominators (\(10 \times 4 = 40\)) instead of finding the LCM (20). This is a very common procedural error for students who have a fragile understanding of fraction addition.
    *   Calculation: \( \frac{27 \times 4}{10 \times 4} + \frac{9 \times 10}{4 \times 10} = \frac{108}{40} + \frac{90}{40} = \frac{198}{40} \). Hmm, my mistake. The answer isn't a direct result of that method.
    *   *Correction on re-thinking:* Let's try another route. A more likely error leading to C is a student multiplying the denominators to get 40, but making a mistake when adjusting the numerators. The most likely cause is finding the numerator total (99) from the correct method and simply placing it over the *incorrect* denominator (40). This indicates a student who is confused by multiple steps and mixes them up.

*   **D) \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \):** This is the classic, most basic error. The student has treated the whole numbers and fractions as completely separate problems.
    *   Add whole numbers: \(2+2=4\).
    *   Add fractions by adding the numerators and adding the denominators: \( \frac{7+1}{10+4} = \frac{8}{14} \).
    *   This is an extremely attractive error for the lowest-attaining students because it feels intuitive and avoids the difficult step of finding a common denominator.

### Prediction Breakdown

**below_basic:** These students lack the foundational skill of finding a common denominator. They will default to the most visually straightforward but incorrect method.
below_basic: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%

**basic:** These students know they need a common denominator but are prone to procedural errors, such as multiplying denominators instead of finding the LCM, or making mistakes converting numerators. Many will also fall into the trap of not reading the "mixed number" instruction carefully.
basic: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%

**proficient:** These students can
