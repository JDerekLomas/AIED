Here is the breakdown, based on my experience marking papers like this. The inclusion of zero is a classic-trap question to see if students truly understand the concept of the mean.

### Analysis of Student Thinking

*   **The Core Concept:** The mean is the "sum of all values" divided by the "number of values".
*   **The Trap:** The number zero. A significant number of students will either ignore the zero when summing (correct) but then also ignore it when counting (incorrect), or they will misapply the concept in another way.
*   **Option A: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \)** This student correctly counts the five numbers (including the zero) for the denominator but incorrectly discards the zero from the sum. This shows a partial understanding – they know there are five data points but think the zero is irrelevant for the numerator. This is a very common error.
*   **Option B: \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \)** This student has completely forgotten the formula for the mean and has just written the numbers down with some symbols. They've also ignored the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). This is a sign of very weak understanding.
*   **Option C: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \)** This is the most attractive distractor. The student thinks that because zero has no value, it should be completely ignored. They have removed it from the sum *and* from the count of numbers. This feels logical to a student who has a procedural but not a deep conceptual understanding. They are effectively finding the mean of 1, 3, 4, and 7.
*   **Option D: None of them.** This is the correct answer. The correct calculation is \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \). To select this, a student must be confident in the formula, correctly calculate the true mean, compare it to the options, and realise none match. This requires a secure understanding and the confidence to reject the "close enough" options.

### Predicted Percentages

**below_basic:** A=15% B=45% C=35% D=5%
*   *Reasoning:* These students have a very insecure grasp of the topic. Many will be confused by the format and just write down the numbers and symbols (Option B). Option C is also highly attractive as "ignoring the zero" feels simple. A few might get the denominator right by counting but will miss the zero in the numerator (A). Very few will have the confidence to correctly identify that D is the answer.

**basic:** A=30% B=10% C=50% D=10%
*   *Reasoning:* This is the group most likely to fall for the main trap (Option C), as it seems logical to them. They've remembered "add them up and divide" but apply it incorrectly to the zero. Option A is the second-most common error, showing partial understanding of the number of items. They are less likely to pick B, as they know a fraction is usually involved. A small number will get it correct.

**proficient:** A=20% B=0% C=30% D=50%
*   *Reasoning:* These students are much more likely to know the correct procedure. However, the trap in C is still very appealing, and under exam pressure, about a third might still fall for it. Another portion will make the less severe error in A. Half of them will correctly identify the required calculation, see that it's not listed, and confidently choose D. They will not choose B.

**advanced:** A=5% B=0% C=5% D=90%
*   *Reasoning:* These students have a strong conceptual understanding. They will immediately recognise that '0' is a valid data point which must be included in the count. They will formulate the correct calculation \( \frac{15}{5} \) in their head, check the options, and see that none are correct. The vast majority will correctly select D. A tiny percentage might have a momentary lapse in concentration and pick A or C.
