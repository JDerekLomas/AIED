Here is my prediction based on my experience marking Year 9 papers.

### Teacher's Analysis

**The Question:** Add two algebraic fractions, \( \frac{3}{2 x}+\frac{4}{x} \). This requires finding a common denominator. The lowest common denominator is `2x`. The calculation should be: \( \frac{3}{2 x}+\frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{3}{2 x}+\frac{8}{2 x} = \frac{11}{2 x} \). The correct answer is **A**.

Let's break down the likely errors leading to the distractors:

*   **Distractor B) \( \frac{7}{3 x} \)**: This comes from the most common misconception when adding fractions: adding the numerators (3+4=7) and adding the denominators (2x+x=3x). This is a very "attractive" error for students who have not understood the core concept of common denominators. It's a fundamental error.
*   **Distractor C) \( \frac{11}{x} \)**: This student likely correctly found a common denominator of `2x`, rewrote the second fraction as `8/2x`, and correctly added the numerators to get 11. However, in the final step, they mistakenly "simplified" `2x` to `x`, perhaps by cancelling the 2 or just getting confused and dropping it. This shows a partial, but flawed, understanding.
*   **Distractor D) \( \frac{7}{2 x} \)**: This student correctly identified `2x` as the common denominator but then failed to adjust the numerator of the second fraction. They calculated \( \frac{3}{2 x}+\frac{4}{2 x} \) by just copying the `4`, leading to `7/2x`. This shows they know a common denominator is needed but don't understand *why* or how to create an equivalent fraction.

### Predictions

**Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the rules for fractions even with numbers, so the algebra adds another layer of confusion. The "add tops, add bottoms" method is the most likely route they will take as it seems simple and intuitive.
below_basic: A=5% B=70% C=10% D=15%

**Basic:** Students at this level know they need a common denominator but are very prone to errors in execution. Many will correctly identify the common denominator (`2x`) but will forget to multiply the numerator of the second fraction, leading them directly to trap `D`. The "add tops, add bottoms" error (`B`) will still be very common. A small number will get the right answer but it's not secure knowledge.
basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%

**Proficient:** These students are confident with the method. They will correctly identify `2x` as the common denominator, correctly convert `4/x` to `8/2x`, and add the numerators. The vast majority will get the correct answer. A small minority might make a careless slip, most likely forgetting to multiply the numerator (`D`) under time pressure.
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%

**Advanced:** These students will find this question straightforward. They will perform the steps accurately and quickly, likely mentally. They understand equivalent fractions deeply, so they will not fall for the common traps. An error from this group would be exceptionally rare and likely a simple slip of the pen, rather than a conceptual misunderstanding.
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
