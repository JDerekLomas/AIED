Here is the analysis and prediction, framed from the perspective of an experienced UK maths teacher.

**Teacher's Pre-marking Analysis:**

Right, let's break this one down before I predict the scores. This question is a classic. It's designed to test if students can handle a simple one-step equation when a fraction is involved. It separates those who truly understand "divide both sides" from those who are just pattern-matching or get flustered by fractions.

*   **The Correct Answer: B) p = 1/36**
    The correct process is to isolate 'p' by dividing both sides by 3. Dividing 1/12 by 3 is the same as multiplying 1/12 by 1/3, which gives 1/36. Proficient and advanced students should get this right. The advanced ones will do it almost without thinking.

*   **Distractor A) p = 1/4**
    This is the most common and "attractive" wrong answer. It comes from making the wrong inverse operation. Instead of dividing by 3, the student multiplies by 3. They think "move the 3 to the other side" and multiply: \( 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \). This error is very typical for students who have a procedural but not a conceptual understanding of solving equations. It feels "natural" to them. Basic level students will fall for this in droves.

*   **Distractor C) p = 4**
    This is the result of ignoring the fraction completely. The student sees '3' and '12' and performs the simplest operation that comes to mind: \( 12 \div 3 = 4 \). They are demonstrating "number grabbing" – taking the two whole numbers they see and doing something with them. They might justify this by incorrectly rearranging the equation to \( 3p \times 12 = 1 \) or something equally confused. This is a classic indicator of a below-basic understanding of both algebra and fractions.

*   **Distractor D) p = 1/9**
    This is a less common error but still plausible. The student might correctly identify that they need to divide, but they incorrectly handle the fraction. They might do \( 3p = \frac{1}{12} \) and think they should divide the denominator by 3: \( p = \frac{1}{12 \div 3} = \frac{1}{4} \) - oh wait, that leads to A. Let's reconsider. Ah, I know what they do. They subtract! They see '3' and '12' and think \( 12-3 = 9 \), so the answer is \( \frac{1}{9} \). This is another form of "number grabbing," just using a different operation. A less likely path, but one a confused student might take. A more likely error is confusing \( 3p \) with \( p+3 \), subtracting 3 from 12... it's a muddle, but it can happen. The most likely path is actually multiplying the numerator by 3 and the denominator by 4: \( \frac{1 \times 3}{3 \times 4} \) from some sort of crossed-out cancelling attempt. A true long-shot guess.

**Predicted Percentages:**

Based on marking 200 of these papers, here's what I'd expect to see.

**below_basic:** A=35% B=10% C=50% D=5%
*(The majority will "number grab" and get C. A significant minority will do the wrong operation and get A. A few might get it right, possibly by luck. The rest will make a more obscure error or guess randomly.)*

**basic:** A=60% B=30% C=10% D=0%
*(This is the group most vulnerable to the main trap (A). They know they need to do something with the 3, but they default to multiplication. A good number will know the correct procedure and get B, but they are the dominant group for answer A.)*

**proficient:** A=10% B=85% C=0% D=5%
*(The vast majority will get this correct. A small number might make a slip under exam pressure and pick A, but they'd likely kick themselves if they checked it. The odd one might make a strange computational error leading to D, but almost none will pick C.)*

**advanced:** A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
*(This is bread-and-butter for an advanced Year 9 student. They will solve it instantly and correctly without a second thought. I would not expect a single student in this category to get this wrong.)*
