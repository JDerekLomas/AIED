Here's my analysis based on marking many, many papers like this.

*   **The Calculation:** The question isolates one part of the FOIL/grid method: multiplying the two constant terms, which are (-1) and (-4). The core skill is multiplying two negative numbers. `(-1) * (-4) = +4`.
*   **Common Errors & Traps:**
    *   **Error for B (-4):** This is the most common error. The student multiplies the numbers `1 * 4 = 4` but forgets or misapplies the rule for signs. They see the negative signs and assume the answer must be negative. It feels "natural" to weaker students.
    *   **Error for D (-5):** This is a classic "misread the operation" error. Instead of multiplying `(-1) * (-4)`, the student adds them: `-1 + (-4) = -5`. This is very common among students who are not confident and panic when they see brackets and symbols.
    *   **Error for C (+5):** This is a double error. The student adds the numbers (to get 5) and *then* incorrectly applies the "two negatives make a positive" rule to their addition, which is a common misconception.
*   **Student Self-Correction:**
    *   Proficient and advanced students will immediately recognise the `negative * negative = positive` rule. They won't fall into the traps.
    *   Basic students are the most likely to fall for B or D. They know they have to do *something* with -1 and -4, but the rules for multiplication vs. addition of negatives are not secure in their minds.
    *   Below-basic students are very likely to add instead of multiply, leading them to D. They see two numbers and default to the most familiar operation.
