Here is my analysis and prediction based on marking many, many Year 9 papers.

### Teacher's Analysis

This is a classic question testing foundational fraction skills. It's designed to see if students can handle mixed numbers efficiently and if they carefully read the instructions.

*   **Correct Answer (A):** The most straightforward method is to add the integers (2 + 1 = 3) and then add the fractions (1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5), combining to get \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \). This is a simple and error-free path for a student who is comfortable with mixed numbers.

*   **Distractor (B):** This is the result of converting both numbers to improper fractions (\( \frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5} \)) but then failing to follow the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number". This is a "technically correct but format-incorrect" answer. It's a trap for students who rush, or who have a single default method for all fraction additions and don't read the question details.

*   **Distractor (C):** The answer \( \frac{18}{10} \) comes from the most common and persistent misconception with adding fractions: adding the numerators and also adding the denominators (\( \frac{11+7}{5+5} = \frac{18}{10} \)). To get here, a student would first have to convert to improper fractions and *then* make the denominator-addition error. This indicates a very weak understanding of fraction arithmetic.

*   **Distractor (D):** The answer \( 3 \frac{3}{10} \) comes from correctly adding the whole numbers (2+1=3) but then making the denominator-addition error on the fractional part (\( \frac{1}{5}+\frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{10} \)). This is a very "attractive" error for students who lack confidence and are just following a visual pattern without understanding the concept of a common denominator. It feels intuitively simple to "add the tops and add the bottoms."
