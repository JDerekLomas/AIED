Here's my analysis based on marking many, many Year 9 papers. This type of question is an excellent discriminator because it combines algebra (solving equations) with number work (fraction manipulation), which often trips students up.

### Teacher's Analysis & Pre-thinking

*   **The Question:** \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\)
*   **The Correct Method:** The goal is to isolate 'p'. To undo "times by 3", we must divide both sides by 3. The calculation is \( p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 \). To divide a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal: \( p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} \), which gives \( p = \frac{1}{36} \). The correct answer is **B**.

#### Analysis of Distractors (The Wrong Answers)

*   **A) \( p=\frac{1}{4} \): The Most Common Trap.**
    *   **Error:** Students see \(3p = \dots 12\) and their brain shouts "divide 12 by 3". They perform the operation \(12 \div 3 = 4\) and incorrectly apply it to the denominator, effectively multiplying the fraction by 3 instead of dividing. This is an extremely "attractive" error because the numbers 3, 12, and 4 are so strongly linked in their minds. It *feels* right.
    *   **Who falls for it?** Students who have a procedural understanding of solving whole-number equations but a weak conceptual grasp of fractions. They see the operation ("divide by 3") but apply it incorrectly to the fractional structure.

*   **C) \( p=4 \): The Whole Number Error.**
    *   **Error:** This student completely ignores the fraction. They see the equation as `3p = 12`, solve it to get `p=4`, and disregard the fact that it was `1/12`.
    *   **Who falls for it?** Students who panic when they see fractions, or those with very low numeracy skills who simplify the problem to one they can manage. It's a sign of a fundamental misunderstanding.

*   **D) \( p=\frac{1}{9} \): The Subtraction Error.**
    *   **Error:** This is less common but demonstrates a confusion of operations. The student thinks "to get rid of the 3, I'll take it away". They subtract 3 from the denominator: \(12 - 3 = 9\).
    *   **Who falls for it?** Students with very weak algebraic foundations who muddle up inverse operations (using subtraction for multiplication) and then apply that incorrectly to the fraction.

#### Predictions by Ability Level

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with both algebra and fractions. They are highly likely to ignore the fraction (C) or fall for the most obvious "number link" trap (A). Many will simply guess.
*   **Basic:** This is the group most susceptible to the most attractive error (A). They know they need to "do something with 3" but apply the operation incorrectly. A significant portion will get it right, but this question is designed to catch them out.
*   **Proficient:** These students generally know how to solve one-step equations and how to handle fractions. Most will correctly identify that they need to divide by 3 and will perform the fraction division correctly. A small number might still make a careless slip and choose A.
*   **Advanced:** These students will see this question and immediately recognise the need to divide `1/12` by 3. They will confidently and accurately perform the calculation. An error at this level would be extremely rare, likely the result of a mis-click on a multiple-choice form rather than a mathematical error.
