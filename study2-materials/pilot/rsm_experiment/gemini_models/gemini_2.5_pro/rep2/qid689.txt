### Teacher's Analysis

This question is a classic test of a student's ability to manipulate algebraic equations, specifically when the unknown is in the denominator. It's designed to catch students who follow procedural "muscle memory" without thinking about the logic of the equation.

*   **The Correct Method:**
    1.  Multiply both sides by `p` to get it out of the denominator: `10p = 5`.
    2.  Divide both sides by 10: `p = 5 / 10`.
    3.  Simplify: `p = 0.5`. This gives answer **A**.
    *   Alternatively, a student might reason that "5 divided by what gives 10?". They must recognise the divisor has to be a number smaller than 1. This "number sense" approach also leads to `p = 0.5`.

*   **Analysis of Incorrect Answers:**
    *   **B) p = 50:** This is the most attractive distractor. Students see the numbers 10 and 5 and their instinct is to multiply them. They might mistakenly think `p = 10 * 5`. This is a very common slip when a student is working quickly or is procedurally weak. They "do something" with the numbers they see.
    *   **C) p = 2:** This comes from an incorrect division. A student sees a `10` and a `5` and their first instinct is often to divide the bigger number by the smaller number, `10 / 5 = 2`. This completely ignores the position of `p` in the fraction. It's a classic error for students who lack confidence with fractions and algebra.
    *   **D) There are no solutions:** This option is usually selected by students who are completely lost. They try to solve it, get a confusing result (like `p=0.5`, which can "feel" wrong to some), and assume it's impossible. A very small number might incorrectly think you can't have a variable in the denominator.
