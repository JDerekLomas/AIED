Here is the prediction based on my experience marking Year 9 papers.

The key to this question is how students handle the zero. The correct calculation, \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \), is not offered as an option. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

**Analysis of Error-Driven Choices:**

*   **A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \):** This is an attractive error for students who know they need to divide by the total count (5 numbers) but mistakenly think the '0' can be ignored in the sum. They know 'adding zero doesn't change anything', but fail to distinguish between the sum and the formal expression of the calculation. This will catch out many students who have a procedural but not a deep understanding.
*   **B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \):** This option will be chosen by students with very weak procedural knowledge, who don't understand the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) or that the fraction bar implies division of the entire numerator. They are essentially pattern-matching for the right numbers and symbols without understanding the calculation's structure.
*   **C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \):** This is the most common and "logical" wrong answer. The student reasons that if you ignore the zero when adding, you should also ignore it when counting how many numbers there are. This shows a consistent but flawed logic. This is a very common trap that many students fall into.
*   **D) None of them:** This is the correct answer. It requires a student to know the correct procedure is to add *all* numbers (including the zero) and divide by the total count of five. They must then confidently check all options, see that none of them represent \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \), and select D. This requires careful reading and confidence.
