Alright, let's put on my marking hat. I can already feel the red pen in my hand. 200 papers... the memories are flooding back. Here's my breakdown of this classic algebraic fractions question. It's a great question because it separates the students who truly understand the process from those who are just pattern-matching or guessing.

### Teacher's Analysis

*   **The Correct Method (Leading to A):**
    Students need to find a common denominator, which is \(2x\). The first fraction is already over \(2x\). They must recognise that the second fraction, \(\frac{4}{x}\), needs to be multiplied top and bottom by 2 to become \(\frac{8}{2x}\). Then they add the numerators: \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}\). This requires a solid procedural understanding.

*   **Error Analysis (The Distractors):**
    *   **B) \( \frac{7}{3 x} \): The Classic Trap.** This is the most common error. Students who don't know the rule for adding fractions will simply add the numerators (3+4=7) and add the denominators (2x+x=3x). This "add tops, add bottoms" method is incredibly attractive to students who have a weak conceptual foundation. It feels simple and logical if you don't know any better.

    *   **C) \( \frac{11}{x} \): The "Over-Cancelling" Error.** To get this, a student might have correctly found the numerators (3+8=11) and the common denominator (2x), resulting in \(\frac{11}{2x}\). Then, in a misguided attempt to "simplify", they might cancel the 2 from the denominator without a corresponding factor in the numerator, or perhaps they combined the \(2x\) and \(x\) into just \(x\). It's a sign of a student who is insecure about simplification rules.

    *   **D) \( \frac{7}{2 x} \): The "Forgotten Step" Error.** This student correctly identifies the common denominator as \(2x\). They know the answer must be over \(2x\). However, they forget to multiply the numerator of the second fraction. They just do 3 + 4 to get 7 for the new numerator. This is a very common slip for students who are on their way to understanding but haven't quite automated the full process yet.
