Here's a breakdown based on my experience marking Year 9 papers.

### Analysis of Errors and Student Thinking

*   **The Core Challenge:** The unknown, \(p\), is in the denominator. This is a classic stumbling block. Many students are used to linear equations like \(2x=10\) or \(\frac{x}{2}=10\), and they try to apply the same, familiar steps without adapting their method.

*   **Correct Method (Answer A):**
    1.  Multiply both sides by \(p\) to get \(10p = 5\).
    2.  Divide both sides by 10 to get \(p = \frac{5}{10}\).
    3.  Simplify to \(p = 0.5\).

*   **Analysis of Incorrect Options:**
    *   **B) \(p=50\):** This is a very common and "attractive" error. Students see a 10 and a 5 on opposite sides of the equation. They know they need to "do something" with the numbers, and multiplying is a common operation. They perform \(10 \times 5 = 50\), ignoring the structure of the equation entirely. This is a procedural error born from a lack of conceptual understanding.
    *   **C) \(p=2\):** This is another very attractive error. The student likely looks at the equation and treats the division sign as a standalone operator. They rearrange the numbers in their head to make an "easier" sum: \(\frac{10}{5} = 2\). This mistake stems from just "number grabbing" and not following the rules of rearranging equations. It's a sign of a very weak grasp of algebra.
    *   **D) There are no solutions:** This option is usually chosen by students who are completely lost and guess, or those who try a method, get a confusing result (like \(0 = 5\)), and incorrectly conclude there's no solution. It’s a less common choice than B or C.
