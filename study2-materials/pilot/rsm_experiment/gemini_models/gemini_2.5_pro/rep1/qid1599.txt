As a seasoned maths teacher, I can practically see the students' working out in my head. This question is a classic test of understanding algebraic notation and order of operations. Here's my breakdown of how the 200 papers would likely split.

**Thinking process before prediction:**

*   **The core concept:** The question `c ÷ (h + 4)` tests whether a student understands that the division bar in a fraction acts as both a division sign and a grouping symbol (like brackets). The entire expression `(h + 4)` must be the denominator.

*   **Option A: `c / (h + 4)`:** This is the correct answer. It correctly places `c` as the numerator and the entire quantity `(h+4)` as the denominator. Proficient and advanced students will get this immediately. Some basic students who have revised this specific topic will also get it right.

*   **Option B: `(c + 4) / (h + 4)`:** This is an unusual error. It suggests a complete lack of understanding, perhaps thinking that the `+4` somehow applies to everything. This would most likely be a guess from a student who is completely lost, perhaps just looking for symmetry in the answer. I wouldn't expect many students to choose this deliberately.

*   **Option C: `c/h + 4`:** This is the most common and attractive incorrect answer. It's the classic trap. A student who doesn't correctly process the brackets in `(h+4)` will apply division before addition (following a flawed application of BIDMAS/BODMAS). They read it as "c divided by h, then add 4". This is the error that will catch out a large number of below basic and basic students, and even some proficient students who are having an off day or rush.

*   **Option D: `(h + 4) / c`:** This is the second most common error. It comes from students mixing up the order of division. They know a fraction is needed and that the two parts are `c` and `(h+4)`, but they incorrectly write them the wrong way around. This is a very frequent mistake for students who are not confident with the `dividend ÷ divisor = numerator / denominator` rule.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=50% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=45% D=15%
proficient: A=90% B=0% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
