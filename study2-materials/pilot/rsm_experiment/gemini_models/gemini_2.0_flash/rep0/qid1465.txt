Okay, here's my prediction for the percentages of students choosing each option at different ability levels:

Here's the breakdown of the reasoning:

*   **Correct Answer:** 3 - 5 + (4 x 2) = 3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6. Therefore, A is correct.

*   **Common Errors:** The main error will come from not following order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). Many students will calculate from left to right.

*   **Option B (4):** Students get this by: (3-5+4)*2 = 2*2=4. Failing on order of operations but performing correctly

*   **Option C (-12):** Students get this by 3-(5+4*2)=3-(5+8)=3-13=-10 and assuming everything is substracted. Students might have partially done order of operation correctly, multiplying but thinking they need to then add, because this is typically used in algebra to distribute

*   **Option D (-10):** Students get this by evaluating strictly left to right: 3-5+4*2=3-5+8=-2+8=-10 This is purely a "from left to right calculation with addition before multiplication. This assumes that substraction gets precedence over addition. This looks bad, especially as PEMDAS / BODMAS is usually printed above the paper

Here are my predictions:

below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=15% D=45%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
