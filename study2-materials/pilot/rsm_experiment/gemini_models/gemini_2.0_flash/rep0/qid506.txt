Okay, here's my prediction based on marking 200 Year 9 mocks, considering the common errors students make with equations involving fractions:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=3% D=7%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0% D=1%

Explanation of predictions:

*   **Correct Answer:** B) \( p=\frac{1}{36} \)

*   **Common Errors and Why They Occur:**

    *   **A)  \( p=\frac{1}{4} \):**  Students are multiplying both sides of the equation by 3 instead of dividing, they see 3p and assume the inverse operation. Below basic may also guess without understanding the fundamentals, it has a ¼ which relates to the question.

    *   **C)  \( p=4 \):** Student have multiplied \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 12. Confusing divide with the inverse

    *   **D)  \( p=\frac{1}{9} \):** A guess. Students think 3x3 = 9 without context to the overall equation

*   **Ability Level Breakdown:**

    *   **Below Basic:** Students struggle with the fundamental concept of inverse operations. Many try something but don't know why. Likely to fall for multiplying by 3 giving a wrong answer of \( p=\frac{1}{4} \). A substantial amount would leave it blank.

    *   **Basic:** These students have some idea of needing to divide, but the fraction is tricky. Often making a calculation errors or not using the correct inverse operation with the fraction and an integer

    *   **Proficient:** Generally understands inverse operations. The main mistakes here arise from miscalculations or momentary lapses in attention with the fraction rather than the operation itself. Some students still lack confidence in these manipulations of fractions and therefore struggle to successfully solve the equations.

    *   **Advanced:** Students at this level almost always get this correct. If an error happens it's a slip up, not a misunderstanding of the process.
