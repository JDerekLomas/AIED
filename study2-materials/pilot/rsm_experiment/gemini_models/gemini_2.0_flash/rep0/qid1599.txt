Okay, here's my prediction for the distribution of answers for that question across different ability levels of Year 9 students, based on common misconceptions and my experience marking papers.

**Thinking:**

*   **Correct Answer (A):** Understanding that division by a sum requires the entire sum to be the denominator is crucial.
*   **Option B:** Tempting to students who (incorrectly) see an implied "add 4 to both parts of the division". Demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of order of operations, and distribution.
*   **Option C:** Reflects an understanding that the c should be divided by the h but suggests either a complete lack of comprehension for putting (h+4) together as a result of the bracket or misunderstanding of operation order by diving first and then adding four afterwards.
*   **Option D:** This answer flips the fraction. Possible because the student knows that some kind of inverse happens and mixes up division and reciprocals. Also it might show a complete guessing.
