Okay, here's my prediction of student responses for the Year 9 mock question, broken down by ability level:

Here's my reasoning, based on years of experience:

*   **Common Errors:** The primary error is a failure to understand or apply the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). Many will perform the addition before the division on the left side. On the right, some may make an addition mistake leading to the wrong overall result and thus an incorrect comparison. I expect *very* few will see an 'at least as big as' answer in (D).

*   **"Attractive" Errors:** Performing operations from left to right regardless of order is very "attractive." I anticipate several students opting to carry it out the operation as they read the page left to right. This means that incorrect calculation would appear 'logical', making them less inclined to doubt their answer. The calculation on the right-hand side will often be fine as the parentheses give that away.

*   **Self-Correction:** More advanced students are more likely to spot the potential order of operations trap and self-correct. A slightly less advanced student might double check through. Below basic student's will fail to evaluate or fail to spot it even is pointed out.

Here's the predictions.
below_basic: A=5% B=55% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%
advanced: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
