Okay, I've just finished marking those Year 9 mocks... *deep sigh*. This question is deceptively simple, but has plenty of opportunities for classic mistakes. Here's my breakdown of likely student responses by ability level:

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=15% D=30%

*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level struggle with the concept of a common denominator.
    *   A: This is a common error. They simply add the numerators and keep *one* of the denominators, failing to make the denominators the same, so doing 3 + 4 = 7. But students tend to 'like' the original denominators best, and just add the numerators above *2x*. A *lot* of below basic students get tricked here.
    *   B: Add everything "3+4" and "2x+x" to end up with a seemingly reasonable answer. This reflects a fundamental lack of understanding of fractions and algebra.
    *   C: Likely adding the numerators to get 7, and doing something vaguely correct by multiplying the '4' in the second numerator to get a '11', but then completely losing the denominator element, with no consideration of equivalent fractions.
    *   D: This is adding the numerators only again, but realising that adding the '2x' and 'x' might somehow equate to '2x' in the result... which gets it the "correct looking" version of the denominator at least. But incorrect entirely.

basic: A=40% B=10% C=10% D=40%

*   **Reasoning:** These students have *some* awareness of needing a common denominator, but don't quite grasp the process or fall into arithmetic errors.
    *   A: As above: add the numerators, but use '2x' without altering the '4' in the second fraction.
    *   B: Still likely trying to just 'add' across the problem
    *   C: Similar thought pattern to below-basic, and probably fewer willing to take that punt.
    *   D: Most common error by a lot. Here, students remember the *idea* of finding a common denominator, realise that '4' should be multiplied to achieve '8' with 2x underneath as a "correct looking denominator" overall, so don't add to the first numerator, or mistakenly still don't use multiplication. This option also contains an aspect of luck, and getting the same 2x *might* suggest it could be the answer.

proficient: A=15% B=5% C=60% D=20%

*   **Reasoning:** These students generally know the method and execute most of it, but minor calculation slips or incomplete simplification costs them.
    *   A: A good few may add 3 and 8 incorrectly and end up here, and choose to continue that path and complete an answer using what they've got to hand, for what is probably an answer somewhere down the paper!
    *   B: Unlikely that this will be arrived at without much greater misconception than other options.
    *   C: This is the correct answer. The student recognises the need for a common denominator, converts 4/x to 8/2x, and then adds 3/2x + 8/2x to get 11/2x. Then cancels *everything*, seeing that /2 is unneeded to achieve 11/x
    *   D: Make the correct method up to the numerator, get '11' instead of cancelling all terms to a common denominator (the *main* part of the question, ultimately.) The most attractive wrong answer at this stage and skill level.

advanced: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%

*   **Reasoning:** These students have a solid understanding and rarely make mistakes, though occasional silly slips can happen.
    *   A: Just a simple numerical error at some stage, most likely addition-based.
    *   B: This just... is not something a good student arrives at.
    *   C: They get it correct, simplifying 11/2x to it's fullest version of 11/x and completing the objective to achieve *single*, *simple* answers as possible.
    *   D: Misinterpretation (even after double-checking).
