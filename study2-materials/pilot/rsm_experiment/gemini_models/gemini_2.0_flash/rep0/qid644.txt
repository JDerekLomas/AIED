Okay, here's my prediction for how Year 9 students would answer this question, broken down by ability level. After marking 200 papers, these are the common mistakes that jump out:

*   **The Core Concept:** The question tests understanding of multiplying negative numbers within the context of expanding brackets. The focus is narrowly on $(-1) \times (-4)$.

*   **Error Analysis:**
    *   **A (+4):** Correct answer.
    *   **B (-4):** Forgetting the rule that a negative times a negative is a positive.
    *   **C (+5):** Incorrectly adding -1 and -4. This implies a misunderstanding of multiplication vs. addition. An attractive error if the student sees both negative signs and does addition instead.
    *   **D (-5):** Doing the addition and incorrectly believing negative times negative to be negative

Here's my predicted breakdown of answers by ability level:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
