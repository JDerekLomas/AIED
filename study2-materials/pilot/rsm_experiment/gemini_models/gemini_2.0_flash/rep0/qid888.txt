Okay, I'm ready to predict student responses to this question based on my experience marking Year 9 mock exams. This question tests expanding brackets, particularly dealing with negative signs which is where the errors usually occur. Here are my predictions:

**Error Analysis:**

*   **Correct Answer:** B) \( m^{2}-12 m+35 \)  This requires correct application of the distributive property (FOIL) and paying close attention to the signs of -5 and -7.
*   **A) \( m^{2}-2 m-35 \):** Incorrectly calculating (-5) + (-7) = -2, instead of -12. Then (-5) x (-7) becomes -35 instead of +35. A big red flag is addition instead of multiplication with the 'numbers'.
*   **C) \( m^{2}+12 m+35 \):** Incorrectly calculating (-5) + (-7) = +12 instead of -12. This happens if they think subtracting a negative means "making it a positive" inside the bracket immediately instead of carrying over from previous answer
*   **D) \( m^{2}-12 m-35 \):** Correctly calculating (-5) + (-7) = -12, but incorrectly calculating (-5) x (-7) = -35 instead of +35. Sign error just on the product part.

**Predicted Response Percentages:**

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
