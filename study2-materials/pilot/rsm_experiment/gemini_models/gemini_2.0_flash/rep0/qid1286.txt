Okay, I'm ready to put on my Year 9 marking hat and predict those responses. Here's my reasoning and predicted percentages:

**Background:** The correct answer is C. Students need to recall the formula for the volume of a sphere, \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), rearrange to make *r* the subject, and then take the cube root.

**Error Analysis & "Attractiveness":**

*   **A: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \)** This represents inverting the fraction on both sides but making *r* the subject rather than *r* cubed, and including pi in the wrong place on the RHS, after the correct substitution.

*   **B: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \)** Students might mix up what to divide and multiply by when rearranging or they simply remember the volume formula wrongly. Attractive as it contains the correct values, albeit misapplied.

*   **C: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \)** Correct answer. Requires correctly manipulating the volume equation.

*   **D: \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \)** Possibly mixing up formula and manipulating in wrong places. Doesn't deal correctly with the fact that pi*r*3 is 4/3 of V. Unattractive because there's no cube root over the whole fraction.

**Ability Level Predictions:**

*   **below_basic:** These students likely struggle with both formula recall and algebraic manipulation. They may attempt to substitute randomly.
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%

*   **basic:** Basic level students might remember *part* of the formula and/or attempt to rearrange, but with limited success. Sign errors are highly likely and there will be less accuracy due to weaker familiarity.
basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%

*   **proficient:** Proficient students will mostly know the formula but may make minor algebraic slips during rearrangement, forgetting the correct order of inverse operations. However, those that remember the initial stages are likely to spot their rearrangement errors.
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%

*   **advanced:** These students are likely to correctly recall and manipulate the formula, thus obtaining the correct solution and avoiding any negative errors due to secure algebraic skills.
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=90% D=5%
