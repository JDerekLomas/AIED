Okay, I've just mentally reviewed 200 Year 9 papers, reliving the joys of substituting into linear equations. Here are my predictions for the multiple choice breakdown based on ability level:

* **Correct Answer:** A (4.25)  To get this, you substitute y = 0.5 into the equation: 10x - 6(0.5) = 30. This simplifies to 10x - 3 = 30, then 10x = 33, and finally x = 3.3.

Let's look at the common errors and the likelihood of students choosing the incorrect options:

* **Option B (-4.25):**  This is where they do something very wrong involving wrong signs, potentially misunderstanding that there's a substraction sign.
* **Option C (3.3):** This is when students obtain 10x = 33 (after the simplification), but fail to finish dividing by ten correctly. A good "attractive nuisance".
* **Option D (2.7):** This is likely derived from misinterpreting the problem altogether.

Here are my percentage predictions:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%
