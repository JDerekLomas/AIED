Okay, I'm ready to predict student responses to this question based on my experience marking Year 9 mock exams. Here's my reasoning and predicted distribution of answers:

**Reasoning:**

*   **Problem P (4 - 5 + 6):** Students often get confused by order of operations when it *appears* straightforward. The important thing here is recognizing that addition and subtraction are done left to right. Students may assume they can begin with addition for the P equation.
*   **Problem Q (4 + 5 x 6):** This tests the understanding of "BODMAS/PEMDAS," specifically the precedence of multiplication. The error will be to perform addition before multiplaction.
*   **Answer Choice Analysis:**
    *   **A:** Getting both wrong, but P would get right, this will most likely only attract the students who have limited undertsanding on calculations.
    *   **B:** Correct. This is what a proficient student knows and applies.
    *   **C:** If getting it wrong, a higher chance of guessing, due to it being a multiplication question.
    *   **D:** Gets problem P wrong, should only attrach student with little maths knowledge, should get higher incorrect marks from question P, due to not beginning from left to right, a low marks students will begin by performing the sum.

**Predicted Distribution:**

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=25% D=50%
basic: A=25% B=50% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0% D=1%
