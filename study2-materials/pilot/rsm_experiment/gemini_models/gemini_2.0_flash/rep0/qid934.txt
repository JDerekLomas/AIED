Okay, I'm ready to simulate marking this question for 200 Year 9 mock papers and provide the predicted percentage breakdown for each ability level. Here's my thought process and predictions:

**Understanding the Question and Potential Errors**

*   **The Correct Method:** Substitute x = 0 into the equation 4x + 2y = 10. This gives 4(0) + 2y = 10, so 2y = 10, and therefore y = 5. Thus, C is the correct answer.
*   **Error leading to A (20):** Likely arises from substituting x=0 to produce the first *term* to substitute to find y. 4 * 0 = 0, hence substituting into an incorrect rearrangement of 4 * 0 + 2y = 10 leads to confusion or misunderstanding. Very poor algebra skill, but some arithmetic ability.
*   **Error leading to B (3):** In substituting, students perform other inverse order or wrong sign in their manipulations of 2y + 4x = 10 and get an algebraic muddle where they manage to substitute in some of the number (most often involving confusion of *subtracting*). Indicates very basic understanding, but very poor algebraic skill.
*   **Error leading to D (2.5):** Students could incorrectly assume when substituting that the unknown y would be used as another substituant within the other term, (as we normally treat "x"), *instead* of just isolating y.
Additionally this answer can be calculated if the whole calculation to obtain y involves 10 ÷ 4 = 2.5 *rather* than (10 - (0)) ÷ 2
Indicates *some* ability and thinking on their feet, as can identify basic substituting method, and some calculation with y to produce a solution to choose at the end of their solution.
*   **Attractive Errors:** D is particularly tempting.
*   **Self-Correction:** Proficient and advanced students are more likely to double-check their work and realize if their answer doesn't logically fit within the context of the equation. They'll spot and fix arithmetic errors and spot incorrect rearrangement of the formula.

**Predicted Percentage Breakdown**

here I include:
- Which mistake each "ability group" will more than other abilities *fall* to making in attempting the solution; which dictates which ability to calculate and extract an option.
- Percentage of ability which knows formula and can solve accurately and extract ( C ) with no substitution error.

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=5% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=75% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
