Okay, I'm ready to analyze this Year 9 fractions question and predict student responses based on ability level. Here's my breakdown:

**Understanding the Question**

The question tests the understanding of multiplying fractions and the effect of negative signs. Students need to recognize that a negative multiplied by a negative yields a positive result.

**Error Analysis & Trap Answers:**

*   **A) \(\frac{4}{3}\)**: This is the correct *numerical* reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\). Students who understand the reciprocal concept but forget about the need for a negative sign to achieve a positive product will fall for this. This is an attractive mistake for all but the strongest students, particularly under exam pressure.
*   **B) \(-\frac{4}{3}\)**: This is the correct answer. This includes understanding reciprocals and correct use of negatives.
*   **C) \(\frac{3}{4}\)**: This comes from a few different misunderstandings. First is students not inverting the fraction and simply choosing the existing one in the fraction shown. Secondly the correct choice for students who are confusing the operations and believe it's asking for what to "add" to -3/4 to obtain -1.
*   **D) \(-\frac{3}{4}\)**: Students not inverting the fraction AND mismanaging negative number operation - adding one.

**Predicted Response Distribution:**

Here's my predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=5% C=55% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=20% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
