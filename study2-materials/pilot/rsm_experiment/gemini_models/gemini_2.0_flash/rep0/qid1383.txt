Okay, here's my breakdown of predicted answer choices by ability level for that question:

**Reasoning:**

*   **A) 81 (Correct Answer):** The correct calculation is (-3)^4 = (-3) \* (-3) \* (-3) \* (-3) = 81.

*   **B) 12:** Students choosing this likely multiplied 4 * 3. This is a misunderstanding of exponents and seeing the numbers given in the problem as things to be multiplied.

*   **C) -81:** This arises from correctly calculating 3^4 = 81, but incorrectly applying the negative sign. These students probably understand exponents *mostly*, but struggle with negative number rules or don't know/forget that a negative number raised to an even power is positive.

*   **D) -12:** Students choosing this likely incorrectly thought k^{4} to be 4 * k. Also these students missed a minus sign. This indicates a misunderstanding of both exponents and of number values/signs in an equation.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=20% B=35% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=55% B=20% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
