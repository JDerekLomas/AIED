Okay, here's my prediction for the breakdown of answers by ability level, based on experience of Year 9 students and the common errors I've seen with similar questions:

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=75% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%

Rationale:

*   **A) Only Tom:** This is arrived at by correctly adding 5 to both sides. It is the single most obvious first step.

*   **B) Only Katie:** This is arrived at by multiplying everything in the original equation by 3, as \( 3*12 = 36\) The student knows multiplication must be done, but struggles with correctly implementing that on the left-hand side

*   **C) Both Tom and Katie:** This requires correctly understanding and executing *either* addition *or* multiplication, *and* recognizing both strategies would solve the problem, hence, the percentages climb with competence.

*   **D) Neither is correct:** This represents either a complete misunderstanding, or a 'cop-out' where the student simply avoids engaging in either part of the logic. At higher competence, this represents failure to engage, and potentially some element of trickery aversion.

**Below Basic:** Students at this level struggle with isolating x and with fraction manipulation. Some may be randomly selecting. Those picking A are showing a very rudimentary step of isolating the X, failing to fully grasp the whole logic.

**Basic:** These students are able to identify a valid algebraic step when it looks simple (like Tom's). They may recognise Katie's manipulation but incorrectly implementing it at the start, not realising this is viable for getting the answer.

**Proficient:** These students mostly understand order of operations and can correctly manipulate both equations. They are comfortable seeing two possible valid methods to get the right answer and can identify both.

**Advanced:** Nearly all of the advanced students will confidently and rapidly understand both options are completely correct. They have a thorough understanding and don't get caught in minor mistakes.
