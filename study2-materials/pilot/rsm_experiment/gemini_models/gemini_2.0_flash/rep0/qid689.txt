Here's my prediction for Year 9 student responses, based on common errors:

*   **Error Analysis:**

    *   **A) p=0.5:** This comes from incorrectly dividing 5 by 10 instead of the other way around. This is perhaps the most tempting "swap" mistake.
    *   **B) p=50:** Students might multiply 10 by 5 directly, without properly understanding the fractional equation. This is a simple multiplication error reflecting poor grasp of algebra.
    *   **C) p=2:** This is the correct answer, obtained by multiplying both sides by *p* to get 10*p* = 5, then dividing both sides by 10.
    *   **D) There are no solutions:** While there are indeed cases where an equation has no solution (particularly later in the course), the linear equation structure would be generally approached without thinking it to lack an answer. This shows severe lack of process but little numerical error.

*   **Ability Level Predictions:**

below_basic: A=45% B=30% C=5% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=75% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%
