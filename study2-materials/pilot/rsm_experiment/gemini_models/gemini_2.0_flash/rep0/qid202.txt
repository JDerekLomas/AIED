Okay, here's my prediction for the percentage of students at each ability level choosing each option, based on my experience of marking Year 9 mock exams.

Here's my reasoning for each answer and the errors it represents:

*   **A) \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \) - Correct Answer:** This is the result of correctly adding the whole numbers and fractions.

*   **B) \( \frac{18}{5} \) - Incorrect, but not entirely wrong:** This is the correct improper fraction representation of the correct answer, which they failed to write as a mixed number.

*   **C) \( \frac{18}{10} \) - Incorrect:** This results from adding the numerators (1+2=3) but *also* adding the denominators (5+5=10), before converting into improper fractions and attempting to solve. A basic misunderstanding of adding fractions.

*   **D) \( 3 \frac{3}{10} \) - Incorrect:** This results from correctly adding the whole numbers, adding the numerators (1+2=3) but *also* adding the denominators (5+5=10), keeping the 'whole' number (similar method to answer C, but converting back to mixed number). Also stems from a basic misunderstanding of adding fractions.

Now, for the percentage predictions:

below_basic: A=25% B=5% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=55% B=20% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
