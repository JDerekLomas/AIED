Okay, here's my prediction of Year 9 student responses, based on my experience marking hundreds of papers:

Here's my thinking:

*   **Correct Answer:** We need to evaluate `y = 3 * (0.3)^2`. This is `3 * 0.09 = 0.27` . Thus B is correct.

*   **Error Analysis:**
    *   **A (0.81):** This comes from doing (3 * 0.3)^2 = (0.9)^2 = 0.81 . Squaring the multiplied value *before* doing the squaring calculation, wrong order of operations, but seemingly logically attractive for students not internalizing BIDMAS.
    *   **C (1.8):** This is `3 * 0.3 * 2` or thinking of the 3x^2 as `6x`. Common because kids have not properly conceptualized exponents and/or confuse with similar terms.
    *   **D (2.7):** Simple: `3 * 0.3 = 0.9` then multiplies by 3 to "account" for the square or just straight-up calculates 3 x (0.3)^1
    *   Order of operations misunderstandings and/or difficulty with decimals will influence error selection a great deal.

Here are my predictions:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=35% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
