Okay, here's my prediction, based on marking hundreds of Year 9 papers with similar fraction questions:

**Understanding the Errors and Attractiveness:**

*   **A) 99/20:** This is the correct answer, expressed as an improper fraction instead of a mixed number. Students making this choice likely understand the arithmetic but didn't follow the exact instructions to express as a mixed number. They probably found a common denominator of 20 and calculated (2*10 + 7)/10 + (2*4 + 1)/4 = 27/10 + 9/4 = 54/20 + 45/20 = 99/20. This shows a decent understanding.
*   **B) 4 19/20:** This is the correct answer.
*   **C) 99/40:** This likely results from an error when converting the whole number parts. Students may add the numerators before creating the improper fraction and correctly add the fractions portion with a denominator of 20, but then multiply by 2 as 99/20 to get 99/40. Some may make errors and calculate (27 + 9)/(10+4) = 36/14. This also demonstrates an error on following BIDMAS (order of operations). This result also includes an improper numerator
*   **D) 4 8/14:** This error likely arises from adding the whole numbers correctly (2+2=4) but then simply adding the numerators and denominators of the fractional parts: 7/10 + 1/4 becoming (7+1)/(10+4) = 8/14.

**Predictions:**

basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
