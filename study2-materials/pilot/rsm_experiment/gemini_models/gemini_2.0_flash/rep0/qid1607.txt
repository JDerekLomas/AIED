Okay, here's my prediction for the percentage breakdown of answers for that question, based on experience marking Year 9 mocks:

**below_basic:** A=40% B=5% C=15% D=40%

*Reasoning:* Students at this level often struggle with the order of operations. Many won't understand how to deal with the fraction or might try to add before multiplying. Step 1 is "difficult", hence the 40% rate. Seeing the 60 gives enough pause and confusion for an equivalent 40% to answer D. A small fraction pick option B randomly. 15% may perform both operations successfully on a fluke.

**basic:** A=50% B=5% C=15% D=30%

*Reasoning:* Basic students are more likely to understand the initial multiplication. However, they may struggle with isolating 'k' correctly. They correctly find Step 1. They recognize the first step being done but do not necessarily have good calculation in the second, hence answering that only Step 1 being correct is greater than the overall rate for it at lower attainment levels.

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=10% D=10%

*Reasoning:* Proficient students are mostly good with order of operations and algebraic manipulation. Their most likely error comes in making a simple adding error during subtracting. There is very little temptation here to simply get both of the steps completely correct since most realise subtraction is needed when +1 goes to the other side of the equation. Students recognize their mistakes by this level and realise they're on track early on if starting the operation out with an incorrect answer and change accordingly

**advanced:** A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%

*Reasoning:* These students almost always nail it. Occasional silly arithmetic errors subtracting 1 from 60 lead to a 'both incorrect' option, but it's very rare. They understand the procedures to solve the equations correctly in very low time and get very close to maximum performance consistently on these kind of algebra equations at such age.
