Okay, here's my prediction for the percentages of students at each ability level choosing each option in the multiple-choice question about calculating the mean, based on my experience marking Year 9 mock exams in the UK:

**Reasoning:**

*   **A (Correct Answer):** This is the correct method for calculating the mean: sum of all values divided by the number of values.

*   **B:** **PEMDAS/BODMAS error**. The division is done before the addition. An 'attractive' mistake because some forget the order of operations.

*   **C:** Dividing by one less than the number of data points. An error that occurs by failing to include a 0 value. Some see 4 non zero numbers.

*   **D:** Acknowledge all equations don't equal the mean.

Here's the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
