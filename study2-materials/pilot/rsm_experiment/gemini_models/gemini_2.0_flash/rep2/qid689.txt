Okay, here's my prediction of Year 9 mock exam responses for the equation  \(10=\frac{5}{p}\), broken down by ability level and with justifications based on common student errors:

below_basic: A=50% B=10% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=35% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=75% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%

Reasoning:

*   **Correct Answer: C (\( p=2 \))**

    The correct method is to either multiply both sides by p to get \(10p = 5\) and then divide by 10, or recognise that \(p = 5/10\)

*   **Error leading to A (\( p=0.5 \)):** This is obtained by performing \(5 \div 10 \) when rearranging

    *Below Basic:* Many may directly divide 5 by 10 without any rearranging leading to a misunderstanding of algebraic principles. Also may confuse 5 divided by p as subtract p from 5

    *Basic:* Likely to make this error with a misunderstanding in their algebraic processes

    *Proficient:* Should spot this as wrong

    *Advanced:* Minimal chance of making this mistake.

*   **Error leading to B (\( p=50 \)):** Multiplying 5 and 10. A complete disregard to what should happen algebraically

    *Below Basic:* High probability here because there is little comprehension of what solving actually means. They might multiply the two given numbers due to lacking the basic process in algebraic manipulation

    *Basic:* Moderate chance that because there is low comprehension, they will just do a random calculation to try and get to the end.

    *Proficient:* Almost No chance.

    *Advanced:* Very No chance

*   **Error leading to D (No solutions):**
    Often students choose "no solutions" if they can't immediately see the answer or if the resulting fraction feels 'wrong'.

    *Below Basic:* May select because they simply don't know where to even begin so they'll be most inclined to select a simple selection with no work.

    *Basic:* They have little ability to do this calculation so no solution becomes a very real idea in their head.

    *Proficient:* Unlikely. They will be more confident at doing the maths, unless if confused by the answer itself.

    *Advanced:* Only if tricked, they will attempt to factor to solve, if its unsolvable, or an empty function (rare for simple eqation), and might be tricked

I have accounted for the fact that after marking 200 papers, one would become adept at understanding common misconceptions!
