Okay, I'm ready to analyze and predict the response distribution for this volume of a sphere question based on typical Year 9 performance. Here's my prediction, considering common errors and ability levels:

Here's my thought process and breakdown of why I've assigned the percentages I have:

*   **The Correct Answer:** C. The volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr³, so r³ = (3V)/(4π)  and  r = cube root((3V)/(4π)).

*   **Common Errors:**
    *   **Confusing Formulas:** Students may misremember the volume formula, confusing it with the surface area or other related formulas involving spheres or circles.
    *   **Algebraic Manipulation:** Even if they have the right formula, students often struggle with the correct order of operations when rearranging the equation to solve for *r*. They may divide when they should multiply, or vice versa.
    *   **Ignoring Constants:** Some students may correctly rearrange parts of the equation but miss key constants like the 3 or the 4/3.
    *   **Cube Root Confusion:** Forgetting to take the cube root at the end is another potential error.
    *   **Panic/Guessing:** Some students, especially at lower ability levels, might simply guess if they are intimidated by the formula.

*   **Attractiveness of Incorrect Answers:**
    *   **Option A:** \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \): This option reverses the fraction 3/4 in front of the V. This is quite tempting because they are trying to get the 4/3 on the other side of the V and not getting the inverse.
    *   **Option B:** \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \): This divides V by π. Similar to the case for option A, students get something on the denominator, however not what should be there.
    *   **Option D:** \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \): This seems derived from using volume=(4/3)πr^2 i.e., the area formula. This demonstrates basic knowledge however a misconception on the actual formula to use.

Now for the predictions:

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
