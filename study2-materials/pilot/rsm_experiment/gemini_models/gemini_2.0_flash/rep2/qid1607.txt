Okay, I've mentally aged myself after marking 200 of these. Here's how I think students performed, broken down by ability levels and answer choices:

**Understanding the Errors**

*   **A) Only step 1:** This implies the student *correctly* performed the multiplication to get to Step 1 but made an *arithmetic error* in subtracting 1. They understand the initial operation but fail on basic number skills. This is VERY attractive if they calculate 60+1.
*   **B) Only step 2:** This answer stems from the incorrect solution 61 for *k*. I don't think students would get this unless the subtracted incorrectly - possibly if their mental processes added one for some reason. Seems unlikely.
*   **C) Both steps are correct:** This signifies complete success, arriving at the correct answer (even though only step 1 should be technically correct), likely understanding the order of operations to inverse the original equations
*   **D) Both steps are incorrect:** A possible confusion around dealing with the fractions initially (instead of multiplying).
    Or a feeling of the value feeling to high (as in not subtracting after)
    Fearing of going through with a seemingly complex sum (showing defeat on equations).

Here's the prediction:

below_basic: A=15% B=5% C=10% D=70%
basic: A=55% B=5% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=0% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=95% D=0%
