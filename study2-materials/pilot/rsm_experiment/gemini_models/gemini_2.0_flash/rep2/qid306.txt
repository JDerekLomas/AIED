Okay, here's my prediction for how Year 9 students would answer that question, broken down by ability level:

**Understanding the Problem & Common Errors**

*   **Problem P:** Many students struggle with the order of operations when it's not explicitly PEMDAS/BODMAS. They naturally want to just go left-to-right.
*   **Problem Q:** This directly tests understanding of multiplication precedence. The common error here is adding before multiplying.

Here are the predictions, based on having graded hundreds of similar papers over the years:

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=75% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%

**Reasoning Behind Predictions:**

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level struggle significantly with order of operations. A large proportion would just work left to right on both, leading to A. Some will correctly remember to multiply in Q.
*   **Basic:** Students have *some* awareness of order of operations, but may not consistently apply it. More students at this level remember that multiplcation goes first.
*   **Proficient:** These students have a good grasp of the order of operations. The correct answer (B) will be high, because most students here understand order of operation. Some might still have left to right intuition about P, giving them A or D.
*   **Advanced:** Most get it right, but a couple will miss this question either by quickly choosing a wrong option without fully reading, or they misread the question.
