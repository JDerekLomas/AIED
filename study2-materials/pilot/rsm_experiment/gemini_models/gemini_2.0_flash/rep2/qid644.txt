Okay, here's my prediction for how Year 9 students would answer that question, based on 200 mock papers worth of experience.

Here's my thought process. The question is testing whether they understand that -1 multiplied by -4 gives a positive number. The common error will likely be to either treat the signs as 'subtraction' and perform the wrong operation.

below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=55% B=25% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
