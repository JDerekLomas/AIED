Here's my prediction for how Year 9 students at different ability levels would answer this question, based on my experience marking mocks:

**Error Analysis:**

*   **Correct Answer:** B) 0.27 (y = 3 * (0.3)^2 = 3 * 0.09 = 0.27)
*   **A) 0.81:** Students correctly square 0.3 to get 0.09, but then either square the 3 separately (9*0.09 = 0.81) Or mistakenly apply the squared function across to the whole product of (3*0.3)^2. 0.9^2 = 0.81
*   **C) 1.8:** Student multiplies 3 * 0.3, then multiplies the answer by 2, trying to apply the ^2
*   **D) 2.7:** Student directly multiplies 3 * 0.3 = 0.9, then multiplies by 3 instead of 0.3 for square rooting.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
