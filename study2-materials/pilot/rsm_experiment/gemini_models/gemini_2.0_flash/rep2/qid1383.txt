Okay, here's my prediction based on years of seeing these exact mistakes crop up, assuming a pretty typical Year 9 mock cohort:

**Error Analysis**

*   **A) 81 (Correct Answer):** This is the correct calculation: (-3)^4 = (-3) * (-3) * (-3) * (-3) = 81
*   **B) 12:** This likely comes from multiplying k and 4:  -3 x 4 = -12, then a misunderstanding removes the minus sign
*   **C) -81:** This error stems from correctly calculating 3^4 = 81, but failing to correctly apply the negative sign to an even power. The student recognizes the importance of the 3 and the 4, but has an insecurity surrounding negative powers.
*   **D) -12:** This combines multiplying -3 and 4 and holding onto the minus sign: -3 x 4 = -12

**Ability Level Predictions**

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
