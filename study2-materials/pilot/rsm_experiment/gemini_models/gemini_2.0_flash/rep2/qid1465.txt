Okay, here's my prediction based on years of marking Year 9 mock exams and seeing common errors:

Here's the correct solution: 3 - 5 + (4 x 2) = 3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6 (A).

Here's my reasoning about the common errors that would occur to the incorrect answers:

*   **B) 4:** Students calculated from left to right ignoring order of operations: 3 - 5 = -2. Then -2 + 4 = 2. Finally, 2 x 2 = 4
*   **C) -12:** Students saw the 4 x 2, but rather than it being + 4 x 2, made this a -4 x 2 instead
*   **D) -10:** Similar error as option B), calculating left to right and therefore having the negative carry on through calculation: 3-5 = -2. -2+4=2. 2x -2 = -4. In an additional mistake multiplying negative with positive incorrectly -2*2= -10

Here's the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=35% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
