Okay, here's my predicted breakdown of answer choices by ability level, based on my experience marking Year 9 mock exams, along with the reasoning:

*   **Understanding the Question and Potential Errors:**

    *   The correct answer is B) \( p=\frac{1}{36} \) because to solve for *p*, you need to divide both sides of the equation by 3. This is the same as multiplying the right side (\(\frac{1}{12}\)) by \(\frac{1}{3}\).

    *   **Error Leading to A (\( p=\frac{1}{4} \)):** Students get this answer when they think to multiply by 3 instead of divide. This stems from incorrectly associating division with multiplication.

    *   **Error Leading to C (\( p=4 \)):** This error happens when the student misunderstands the question and only look to multiplying by 12 or get confused dividing 12 by 3.

    *   **Error Leading to D (\( p=\frac{1}{9} \)):** No obvious error comes to mind for students to give this as the result. I would not expect to see this option come up, relative to the others.

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=30% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
