Okay, here's my prediction of how Year 9 students at different ability levels would answer the multiple-choice question, based on my experience of marking hundreds of papers:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=10% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%

Reasoning:

*   **A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)** (Correct Answer): This is the correct algebraic representation.

*   **B) \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)**:  This represents \( (c+4) \div (h+4) \). This is a completely fabricated relationship based on no clear mathematical misstep, perhaps representing simple guessing.

*   **C) \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)**: This represents \( (c \div h) + 4 \). This is a particularly *attractive* error. Students might see the 'c' and 'h' and connect them and then connect the +4 after in the mistaken order. A fair number of students will select this option.

*   **D) \( \frac{h+4}{c} \)**: This represents \( (h+4) \div c \). This arises perhaps where students are generally unsure and think the order should be swapped, thinking "bottom divided by top is a thing somewhere" or a feeling for "putting letters at the bottom". This also taps into that student perception of an inverted relationship is asked of them.

**Ability Level Breakdown:**

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with abstract algebraic notation. Guessing plays a large role. D has a particular visual appeal based on unsure order and placement in a fraction. C catches out this group too who often will just do operations as they come rather than with order.

*   **Basic:** These students understand basic fractions. A significant proportion (50%) would pick A. However, the lure of breaking down the symbols by tackling *parts* (c, h, then +4) leads a huge fraction of basic learners to select answer C, betraying the actual meaning of bracketed expressions, and the overall equation as an actual 'function' if you would.

*   **Proficient:** These students generally understand the correct conventions and understand brackets change the interpretation, hence a far stronger selection of A. Their errors become less about misconception and are closer to reading errors.

*   **Advanced:** At this level, students are very confident with algebraic manipulation and representation. Very few errors arise beyond potentially simple reading slips. A is the nearly universal option picked.
