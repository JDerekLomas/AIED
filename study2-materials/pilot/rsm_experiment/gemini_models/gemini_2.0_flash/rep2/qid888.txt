Okay, here's my prediction, based on having marked *many* similar questions:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%

Reasoning:

*   **Correct Answer:** B. `m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35`

*   **Option A (m^2 - 2m - 35):**  Arises from incorrectly subtracting the numbers within the brackets (7-5=2) instead of multiplying. The -35 part is correct which demonstrates at least knowing there has to be multiplication happening somehow. It shows a failure to see this as double brackets multiplying with FOIL/grid method etc.

*   **Option C (m^2 + 12m + 35):** Arises from incorrect sign usage. Students might add +7 and +5 to get +12, forgetting about the two negative signs from the -5 and -7 inside the bracket, or mistakenly multiplying -5*-7 and thinking the answer is negative. Common among students who only apply the negative to one component in the binomial.

*   **Option D (m^2 - 12m - 35):** The main error here is getting the sign wrong when multiplying -5 by -7, resulting in a negative instead of positive. They can correctly combine the *m* terms as -12m, but fumble with the sign multiplication. Shows at least understanding of *m* terms and how to combine.

Breakdown by Ability:

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level are likely to make multiple errors. Confusion around signs is widespread. They will likely struggle with multiplying out the brackets and making sense of order of operation (combining then multiplying or vv). Many won't remember how to approach and opt for multiplying only part of the bracket/ linear approaches or missing terms completely. -35 has a decent pull.

*   **Basic:** These students usually have a vague grasp of expanding brackets but can be inconsistent with the negative signs and the actual multiplication process, specifically with binomial multiplications. The 'basic' student generally multiplies and realises there should be adding and minus numbers to do *something.*

*   **Proficient:** Students at this level understand the concept of expanding brackets but might make minor slips like getting a sign wrong on rare occasions. Very little error on understanding multiplication. Confident application expected.

*   **Advanced:** Advanced students will confidently and correctly expand the brackets without making significant errors. Any mistake is just a rare and true slip, easily caught when checking their work.
