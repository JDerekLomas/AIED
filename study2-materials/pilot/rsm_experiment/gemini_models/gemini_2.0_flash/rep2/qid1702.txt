Okay, I'm ready to channel my inner, tired but experienced, Year 9 mock exam marker after sifting through 200 papers. Let's break down the probable responses to this question based on student ability:

The correct answer is A) 4.25. Substituting y=0.5 into 10x-6y = 30 gives 10x - 6(0.5) = 30, therefore 10x - 3 = 30, 10x = 33, x = 3.3

It should be "obvious" once that is known, even for some below basics, what the real issue here is that they would just sub x and y in back into the equation to work out which one works.

*   **A) 3.3**: Seems too easy
*   **B) -4.25**: People do get sign errors all of the time when dealing with algebra. I feel this would occur if there are negatives and substitutions of values into equation. I think in reality few pupils would actually come to the actual equation for this but there will always be some to be had
*   **C) 4.25**: Wrong ordering of subtraction and division

**below_basic:** A=15% B=5% C=10% D=10%
They are all pretty unattracitive here! Lots of random answers being generated. Some substitution occurs but little logical flow beyond a very vague awareness of needing to do something with numbers they see!

**basic:** A=30% B=20% C=30% D=10%
Most 'basic' will likely be aware of substitution as a technique, but may not understand how it applies or they are unsure. Some 'attractive' answers could well make an appearnce as working backwards they are close in value to it working or maybe people doing trial and error for the fun of it (unlikely)

**proficient:** A=60% B=5% C=20% D=10%
Proficient candidates have a better grasp on equations and substitution and a larger degree of confidence of what is going on within. Some will come unstuck. If in panic mode. The lack of brackets becomes key. However more are prone to fall out here by rushing due to being comfortable so less obvious substitutions can work (in particular, 3.3 gets substituted instead of what it *should* be - namely a substitute for x. They would feel "right")

**advanced:** A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%
Advanced students should breeze through this. Most will likely use more than 1 minute to actually complete so it does have a larger window to pick on those few mistakes that can slip.
