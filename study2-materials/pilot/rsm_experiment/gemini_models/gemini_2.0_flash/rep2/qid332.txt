Okay, I'm ready to simulate the marking of this Year 9 mock exam question after reviewing 200 papers. Here's my prediction of how students at different ability levels would answer:

**Reasoning:**

*   **Tom's statement (\( \frac{x}{3}=17 \)):** This requires adding 5 to both sides, a relatively straightforward operation. It's a very common first step and unlikely to trip up anyone above below-basic.

*   **Katie's statement (\( x-5=36 \)):** This requires multiplying both sides of the original equation by 3. Critically, students often forget that multiplying (x/3) by 3 only isolates the 'x', and also make a mistake multiplying 5 x 3 before shifting it across. Students might *think* this follows "multiplying through," but it contains a distribution error. It's trickier and sets a good trap for those who haven't fully grasped the order of operations in equation solving. This also depends whether or not Katie did it in one move: \(\frac{x}{3}-5=12\) -> \(x - 15 = 36\) -> \( x-5=36 \) isn't a step, even if there are some very convoluted ways to get there!

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level often struggle with fraction manipulation and/or do not know the 'correct' sequence to solve equations, so will get easily muddled.

*   **Basic:** Students are starting to understand how to work through this process but will trip up with distribution in Katie's suggestion and/or make arithmetic errors.

*   **Proficient:** Most of the students know Tom is correct. The common error is for the better ones here, when slightly fatigued after a mock exam to not spend time going through both carefully - rushing onto the next question instead of properly proving that it's not just Tom who's correct!

*   **Advanced:** Advanced students will identify that Tom's statement is correct very quickly. These students are far less likely to be tricked, spotting immediately where an incorrect distribution of multiplication would go wrong.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=80% D=15%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
