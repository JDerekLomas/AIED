Okay, I've marked enough of these to have a pretty good idea of the common mistakes! Here's my prediction of student responses by ability level for the question  \( 2 \frac{7}{10}+2 \frac{1}{4}= \) (leaving the answer as a mixed number).

Here's the correct working:
\( 2 \frac{7}{10}+2 \frac{1}{4} = 2 + 2 + \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} = 4 + \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = 4 + \frac{19}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}\)

Here's the breakdown of why each incorrect answer appears:

*   **A) \(\frac{99}{20}\):** This answer comes from incorrectly converting the *correct* mixed number to an improper fraction. The calculation error would be multiplying 4 by 20 to get 80, adding 19 to get 99, so 99/20. Students get the fractional parts correct.

*   **C) \(\frac{99}{40}\):** A student could get to this answer by:
    1.  Making correct improper fractions 27/10 and 9/4.
    2. Add numerator of equivalent fractions incorrectly (i.e adding \( \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20}\) incorrectly

*   **D) \(4 \frac{8}{14}\):** This stems from adding the whole numbers correctly, and adding the numerators *and* denominators of the fractions independently: \(2+2 = 4\), \(7+1 = 8\) and \(10 + 4 = 14\)

Now, my percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=10% D=65%
basic: A=10% B=55% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=3% B=95% C=1% D=1%
