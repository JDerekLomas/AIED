Okay, here's my prediction of how Year 9 students across different ability levels would answer this question, based on my experience marking hundreds of their papers. I'll explain my reasoning below.

**Reasoning:**

*   **The Correct Answer:** D) 2.5. Students need to substitute *x* = 0 into the equation *4x + 2y = 10* to get *2y = 10*, then solve for *y*. This means dividing 10 by 2, so *y* = 5 is their intermediate answer, which then has to be associated to a 0 paired x value. It doesn't naturally match the answer to what's next.

*   **A) 20:** This is an incorrect answer that is only reached by mistakes in the original problem (like *y*=5 for (4, y) ). Some students will grab this.

*   **B) 3:** This comes from rearranging to get 2*y* = 10-4x (but done so incorrectly - often seen by multiplying 4 by the 1 and using this value, without dealing with what the values for x mean.) This is also an attractive option to students who think 12/4 to "undo the operation" by not considering BEDMAS.

*   **C) 5:** This is an intermediate step in calculating 10 / 2 *after plugging in 0* to the left part of the formula correctly.* Students who find y in their scratchwork, but don't recognise how to choose this will find the "nearness" enticing. This represents some partial understanding. They see the right numbers being involved, but not recognising *x* can have 0 and its effect when substituted.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=25% C=40% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=15% D=70%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=5% D=90%
