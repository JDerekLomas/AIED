Okay, I'm ready to predict the percentages for this question based on my experience marking Year 9 mocks. The question tests understanding of multiplying negative fractions to obtain a positive result.

Here's my breakdown:

**Common Errors and Attractiveness:**

*   **Forgetting the negative sign (leading to A):** This is highly attractive, especially for lower ability students who are focused on the numerical part of the calculation. They know they need to invert the fraction but might miss the sign change needed.
*   **Not inverting the fraction (leading to D):** These students understand multiplying fractions and maybe some negative number rules, but aren't quite connecting multiplying by reciprocals for the 'equals 1' aspect. This is less attractive than simply ignoring the sign.
*   **Confusing which sign is the 'correct' sign (leading to C):** Least attractive error of all, because that is a basic negative multiplication fact. This can be because they remember that we must 'flip the sign', but think since it started out with negative, it will continue with negative sign.

Now, the predictions:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=75% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
