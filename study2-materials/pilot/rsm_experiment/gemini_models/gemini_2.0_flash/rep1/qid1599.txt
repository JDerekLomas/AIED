Okay, here's my prediction based on years of marking Year 9 mocks and seeing common algebraic errors:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=3% C=5% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%

Reasoning:

*   **A (\(\frac{c}{h+4}\)):** This is the correct answer.

*   **B (\(\frac{c+4}{h+4}\)):** This stems from an incorrect attempt to apply some perceived rule related to distribution or cancelling. A "below basic" might just try adding 4 all over to see if anything changes!

*   **C (\(\frac{c}{h}+4\)):** Students choosing this answer are likely struggling with the order of operations. They might correctly convert the division of *c* by *h* to a fraction (\(\frac{c}{h}\)) but incorrectly then place the \(+4\) on the side as an extra part of the term

*   **D (\(\frac{h+4}{c}\)):** The 'inversion' happens by accident a number of ways - it gets easily muddled when students rewrite/rearrange things. Some might vaguely remember some algebraic manipulation rule without understanding it.

Here's the breakdown by ability level:

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level will likely be guessing or making fundamental errors with fractions and/or variable handling. They struggle with interpreting the notation. "A" probably benefits from being at least vaguely fraction-looking so gets the plurality on look alone. There will be little systematic reason behind most choices.
*   **Basic:** These students have some grasp of algebraic notation but struggle to apply the correct order of operations, especially when presented in the context of a fraction. They are the most likely to be tricked into the *c/h* structure of Option C. About half manage to reason their way through and find the right form
*   **Proficient:** Most proficient students will immediately recognize the correct fractional representation. Errors here might arise from rushing or misreading. Some will quickly sub in numbers and try them
*   **Advanced:** Advanced students are highly likely to get this correct. Any errors would be due to careless mistakes.
