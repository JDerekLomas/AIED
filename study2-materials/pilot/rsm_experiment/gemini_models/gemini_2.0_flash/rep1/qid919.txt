Okay, here's my prediction of how different ability levels would answer the question, based on common errors I see in Year 9 mock exams.

**The Correct Answer is B) 0.27**

Here's a breakdown of the likely errors:

*   **A) 0.81:** This is the result of correctly squaring 0.3 (0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09) but then incorrectly multiplying by 9 instead of by 3 and not placing the decimal point properly (9 x 0.09= 0.81)
*   **B) 0.27:** This is the correct answer: 3 * (0.3)^2 = 3 * 0.09 = 0.27
*   **C) 1.8:** This comes from correctly performing (0.3 * 3) and then only multiplying once ( 0.3 x 3 = 0.9 then doubling that result 0.9 x 2 = 1.8. Many will use trial and error, but use the squared incorrectly, so 3* 0.3 and get the result by mistake)
*   **D) 2.7:** This comes from mistakenly using multiplication, performing (0.3 * 3) twice with some squaring errors: a lot of errors on what squaring really mean. They might think they multiply .3 *3 and get .9 and multiply that * 3 again: .9*3=2.7

Here are my predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=30% B=35% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
