Okay, here's my prediction for how different ability levels would answer this question, based on years of seeing Year 9 students make mistakes on similar problems:

**Understanding the Question & Possible Errors**

The core task is to substitute y = 0.5 into the equation 10x - 6y = 30 and solve for x. The common errors I anticipate are:

*   **Misunderstanding Order of Operations:** Calculating 6 * 0.5 incorrectly.
*   **Incorrect Substitution/Rearrangement:** Getting the sign wrong when moving terms across the equals sign or adding instead of subtracting (or vice versa).
*   **Arithmetic Errors:** Simple calculation errors in the addition/subtraction or division steps.
*   **Not Understanding Substitution at all:** Completely missing the point of substituting the value.
* **Negative y**: Ignoring the minus sign associated with the y coefficient

Let's analyse the answer options. The correct answer will be found by the substitution 10x - 6(0.5) = 30 --> 10x - 3 = 30 --> 10x = 33 --> x = 3.3

A) 4.25 comes from incorrectly adding instead of subtracting 3 (10x +3=30 leading to 10x=27 -->x=2.7, they then may multiply 2.7 x1.25 by mistakr which makes it 4.25 (unlikely but a potential "double blunder")
B) -4.25 comes from similar incorrect addition that A gives, but forgetting the - sign. This is VERY UNLIKELY
C) 3.3 is the CORRECT ANSWER
D) 2.7 comes from incorrectly adding instead of subtracting 3 (10x +3=30 leading to 10x=27 -->x=2.7
