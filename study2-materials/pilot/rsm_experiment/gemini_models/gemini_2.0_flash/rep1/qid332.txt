Okay, here's my prediction based on 200 marked Year 9 mock papers covering algebraic manipulation, remembering the common pitfalls and assuming this question appeared about halfway through a non-calculator paper:

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=10% D=50%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=5% C=70% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%

Reasoning:

*   **Below Basic:** These students struggle with fundamental algebra concepts. They're easily confused by fractions and order of operations.
    *   A: Tom looks less scary. Might add 5 to 12. (30%)
    *   B: They focus only on Katie and somehow multiply 12 and 3 or just get an x on one side with = some number.
    *   C: Hope for the best that you remember learning a step
    *   D: More probable at the below_basic skill since there is no actual thought through answers to make them select the answer.

*   **Basic:** These students understand the individual steps but may struggle to execute them accurately or recognize valid alternatives. They may have trouble understanding different, correct methodologies.
    *   A: More likely to add 5 on the right side than know the second step.
    *   B: This looks confusing, but "maybe?" They probably can't explain why or apply it.
    *   C: There is some recognition from these kids in the level of Basic that both students can be correct here.
    *   D: Not confident. They might sense both answers look different than the initial question, therefore, maybe the wrong answers all together.

*   **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with basic algebraic manipulation and order of operations. They're likely to correctly evaluate both Tom and Katie's statements, but can sometimes second-guess themselves.
    *   A: See fraction, might overthink and hesitate.
    *   B: Possibly tempted as Katie's looks different, potentially an issue because it did 2x operations.
    *   C: Comfortable that Tom looks like "the right next step", more calculating than just answering. (70%)
    *   D: These students get through all steps for both Tom & Katie's equations before finalizing and finding what's what.

*   **Advanced:** These students are secure in their understanding of algebra. They easily see the equivalence of the different correct steps.
    *   A, B, D: Negligible error. The only incorrect answers now are errors due to misread or very poor working or under pressure (like this part of a mock exam) and can be seen with the other error chances to 2, 1, and 2, respectively.

Key Considerations for above mark up predictions:

*   **Common Errors:** Not understanding the properties of operations
*   **Attractive Errors:** Following PEMDAS only as a next immediate step or failing to reverse operations for simplification (subtracting/addition only).
*   **Catching Errors:** Proficient students are more likely to work through both sides fully but that might mislead those unsure on simplification to go "off piste" as they call it and get stuck and try another method.
*   **Hesitation/second thoughts** The students doing fairly well but get bogged down because they are struggling but understand the properties.

I believe this accurately captures how Year 9 students would perform on this type of question.
