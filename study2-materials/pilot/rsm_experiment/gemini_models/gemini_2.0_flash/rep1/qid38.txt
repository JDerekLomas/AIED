Okay, here's my prediction for Year 9 performance on this question, based on common errors I've seen over many years of teaching and marking.

Here's the correct solution:  \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4 * 2}{x * 2} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \)
So A is the correct answer.

Now, let's look at error probabilities at each level.

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%
*Explanation:* Students at this level struggle with fraction manipulation and algebra. They'll likely guess or add numerators and denominators directly. Option C might seem appealing because they incorrectly see "x" as a common denominator and try to add numerators only (3+4 = 7, then seeing if the answer is available (incorrect)). Also "add both, multiply both is surprisingly compelling to the less mathematical).

basic: A=40% B=15% C=25% D=20%
*Explanation:* These students recognize the need for a common denominator, but make mistakes when creating it, or misunderstand where x should feature. The stronger ones will realise x needs to stay in the denomenator. Options C will result from not finding a common denomenator at all. Options D is quite easy. Some of this tier may have problems scaling up the numerators accordingly to correctly generate the final fraction

proficient: A=75% B=5% C=10% D=10%
*Explanation:* Most of this level will correctly find the common denominator and add the fractions. Silly mistakes will sometimes make people mis-remember the multiple needed to reach the correct fractions but usually find the right answer. However some can still simply miss the multiplier altogether which will lead to option D. Also some degree of calculation error may come in too when it gets to adding the final numerals

advanced: A=95% B=1% C=2% D=2%
*Explanation:* These students should find this question very easy. The small number of errors will likely be down to misreading the question, rushing or extremely silly arithmetic errors.
