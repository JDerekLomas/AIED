Okay, here's my prediction of how Year 9 students would answer that question, based on 200 mock papers' worth of experience.

Here's the breakdown of likely student responses:

* **Correct Answer:** A (+4)
* **Error Analysis:**
    *   The most common error is likely to do with sign rules. Many will forget that -1 x -4 results in a positive number.

Here's my predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=45% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
