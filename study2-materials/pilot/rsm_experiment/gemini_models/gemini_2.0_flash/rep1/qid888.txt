Okay, I've just mentally scarred myself by reliving the trauma of 200 Year 9 mocks and am ready to predict some error distributions for this lovely expanding brackets question. Here's my breakdown:

**Common Errors and Student Thinking:**

*   **B (Correct Answer: \( m^{2}-12 m+35 \)):** The correct application of FOIL/grid method, accurately multiplying and dealing with the negative signs.
*   **A (\( m^{2}-2 m-35 \)):** This arises from incorrectly adding the constants, specifically doing -5 + (-7) = -2 instead of multiplying -5 * -7 to get +35. Might be thinking of simply adding instead of expanding. Also struggling with the minus sign in front of each constant.
*   **C (\( m^{2}+12 m+35 \)):** This comes from struggling with the signs of negative terms while multiplying. (-5 * -7 is performed correctly). There has been confusion about -5 -7 =+12
*   **D (\( m^{2}-12 m-35 \)):** The confusion in multiplying (-5)*(-7). Both middle terms (formed when expanding) and end term are treated with same (mis)conception regarding minus sign usage.

Here's my prediction of student response distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=5% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=65% C=15% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%
