Okay, I'm ready to channel my inner Year 9 maths teacher (post-200 mock papers...send coffee!). Here's my prediction for the percentages for each option, based on ability level and likely student errors:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%

Reasoning:

*   **Correct Answer:** B (\(p = \frac{1}{36}\))
*   The operation required is division.
*Below Basic:* Struggle with manipulation of fractions, therefore dividing or multiplying and whole numbers is likely difficult. Many below basic students might not understand basic algebraic notation like '3p'. 1/12 /3 might be wrongly confused with 1/12 - 3
*Basic:* Know to divide, but may struggle dividing a fraction by a whole number and miss reciprocal/manipulation with fraction, or simply guess based on "fraction must have big number"
*Proficient:* Very capable of manipulating equation in their mind. Division might be a small problem for them, might incorrectly add at the last stage. The likelihood is students at this grade got it correct
*Advanced:* This will likely not prove problematic for most advanced students

*   **A: p = 1/4**

    *Below Basic:* Might associate the 3 as part of the denominator and mistakenly apply multiplication rather than division and incorrectly obtain. This answer isn't 'attractive' because they cannot clearly visualise how they could get the correct number
    *Basic:* Some student might incorrectly identify to multiply at each stage. Similar problems as to the below basic students, with the equation in that it seems so simple that it has to be "complicated"

*   **C: p = 4**
*Below Basic:* Might try to incorrectly rearrange the fraction, without any valid logic or correct calculation

*Basic:*Unlikely

*   **D: p = 1/9**
*Below Basic:* The below basics have to guess from 1/n due to them getting a conceptual aspect from it. It's unlikely for student in this band to follow and fully solve.
*Basic:* Some could think of taking 'square root of 3' instead of division and come with "something like it", however, more students at these grades should hopefully remember 'inverse of multiply, divide.'
