Okay, here's my breakdown of expected answer choices by ability level for that question, based on my experience marking similar exams:

Here's the error analysis I used to inform my predictions:

*   **Correct Answer:** B (\(4 \frac{19}{20}\)) - This requires converting the mixed numbers to improper fractions, adding them, and converting back, or adding the whole number parts, adding the fractional parts after finding a common denominator, and simplifying if necessary.

*   **A) \( \frac{99}{20} \)** - (Incorrect Mixed Number Conversion) Students converted properly to \(\frac{27}{10}\) and \(\frac{9}{4}\) so \(\frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20}\) and they were able to add to \(\frac{99}{20}\), but didn't change to a mixed number.

*   **C) \( \frac{99}{40} \)** - (Adding Denominators) This is gotten by \(\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{27 + 9}{10+4} = \frac{36}{14} \approx\). \(\frac{9}{4}\) Students correctly find the equivalent fractions \(\frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20}\), and still end up adding denominators somehow instead of only the numerators! Then reducing by factor of 2!

*   **D) \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \)** - (Adding Fractions Directly, Improperly Simplifying) Add the whole numbers together: \(2 + 2 = 4\). Add numerators and denominators together from fractions. The answer, before reducing would be something that looks like \( 4 \frac{7+1}{10+4} = 4\frac{8}{14}\). A classic misunderstanding of fraction addition. They have attempted to simplify, which makes it more plausible

Now the predictions:

below_basic: A=15% B=5% C=35% D=45%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=70% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
