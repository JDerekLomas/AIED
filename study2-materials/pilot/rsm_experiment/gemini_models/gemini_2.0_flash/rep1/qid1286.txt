Okay, here's my prediction for how Year 9 students of different abilities would answer that sphere volume question, based on my experience marking similar questions on mock exams:

Here's my reasoning:

*   **The Correct Answer:** C) $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$

    The volume of a sphere is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. To find the radius $r$, we need to rearrange this formula:

    1.  Multiply both sides by $\frac{3}{4\pi}$: $r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$
    2.  Take the cube root of both sides: $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$
*   **Common Errors & Attractiveness:**

    *   **Option A)  \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \)**
        *   Error: This answer essentially mixes up the fraction.
        *   Attractiveness: A common mistake is to just "muddle through" the rearranging.  Flipping fractions when they shouldn't is rampant. The pi in the numerator could come from either not knowing what operation needs to be done, or that it is sometimes in the numerator.
    *   **Option B) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{cm} \)**
        * Error: Similar to A but now places pi on the denominator, perhaps they recognize it's typically on the denominator?
        *   Attractiveness: Slightly less attractive than A since at least they did 4V in the numerator correctly, which might indicate at least partial grasp on rearranging a fraction in this way.

    *   **Option D) \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{cm} \)**
        * Error: Forget to divide by (4 * pi) or divide by pi or similar. Forget to cube root numbers too
        * Attractiveness: Not as much. This would most likely be guesses

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
