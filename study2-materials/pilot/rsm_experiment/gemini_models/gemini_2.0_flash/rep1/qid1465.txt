Okay, here's my prediction of how different ability levels of Year 9 students would answer the question, based on common errors I've seen in past papers:

**Reasoning:**

*   **Correct Answer:** The correct order of operations is Multiplication, then Addition and Subtraction from left to right.  4 x 2 = 8. Then, 3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6.  So, the answer is A.

*   **Error leading to B (4):** Performing addition and subtraction left to right, THEN multiplication: (3-5+4)*2 = (2)*2 = 4
This looks easier than learning how to evaluate indices

*   **Error leading to C (-12):** Students perform left to right, missing sign changes for addition and multiplication : 3 -5 +4 x 2 => 3 -5 = -2 ; -2 +4 = 2; 2*-2 = -12. Or left to right ignoring correct sign usage 3 -5 + (4*-2) => 3-5 + (-8) = -2 -8 = -10

*   **Error leading to D (-10):** performing addition/subtraction before Multiplication but not properly adding.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
