Okay, here's my prediction for how students at different ability levels would answer that mean question, based on my experience marking Year 9 mocks:

Here's how I broke down the reasoning for each answer choice and ability level:

*   **Correct Answer:** *A) (1+3+4+7) / 5* This answer demonstrates understanding of the definition of mean as the sum of all the data divided by the number of data. The number 0 has also been correctly dropped as addition or substraction has no affect on the total.

*   **Incorrect Answer B): *0+1+3+4+7 ÷ 5*:** This is a common mistake arising from misunderstanding order of operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS). The division (7 / 5) is performed *before* the addition, leading to an incorrect result. It might appear attractive to below basic students as all numbers are listed and easy to apply without further problem solving.

*   **Incorrect Answer C): *(1+3+4+7) / 4*:** This answer has a correct methodology with calculating the mean with summation of the numbers and division but the denominator represents an incorrect count. Many of all ability levels would overlook adding '0' into the numbers provided, and would simply miss counting '0' in their counting process for calculating the mean.

*   **Incorrect Answer D): None of them:** This response represents a student who either doesn't understand the concept of the mean, and can not deduce the equation to calculate it or may also have calculated the answer in working memory. They likely believe no given calculation can reach a potential answer and thus opt for 'None of them'.

Here are my predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=55% B=25% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=2% D=2%
