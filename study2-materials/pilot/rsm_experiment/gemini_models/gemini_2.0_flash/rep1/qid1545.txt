Okay, here's my prediction for how Year 9 students of varying ability levels would answer the BODMAS/order of operations question:

Here's my reasoning, keeping in mind common misconceptions:

**General Observations:** The most tempting error is not applying BODMAS/PEMDAS correctly in the left-hand expression. Students often perform the addition before the division.

**below_basic:**
*   A = Most students at this level won't apply order of operations and calculate left to right, so get 20 / 4 = 5, while on the RHS they will apply the brackets first, getting 20/4=5. Thus, will assume the symbol should have a relation which includes equal. As the relation is normally greater, will choose that.
*   B = They won't understand the need for brackets to show a value is 'smaller'.
*   C = This option attracts those who work correctly with brackets.
*   D = There won't be many who realise D makes sense, although a minority might remember 'greater than or equal to'.

**basic:**
*   A = Students will still tend to not apply BODMAS/PEMDAS in this option. Will result in it having a higher chance than B for incorrect application of the method.
*   B = Likely the largest wrong option as many students will misapply BODMAS rules on the left hand side. Students will realise 20 divided by something makes something smaller, compared to just dividing the right hand side straight. Thus, a relationship of greater might naturally be assumed.
*   C = Starts to increase for students applying the operations correctly. Some, however, may fail to do it as easily.
*   D = D would have less common choice than below, given that the order is still complicated for applying logic in that domain.

**proficient:**
*   A = At this stage the BODMAS rule is applied by the better students. Thus this option would be one of the least likely due to students applying the method.
*   B = Very less likely as students would be at least somewhat familiar with BEDMAS and thus avoid simple calculations.
*   C = Large leap as there's proper use of formula and remembering that (equal symbol exists)
*   D = With increasing skill and experience, it would make it all the way here.

**advanced:**
*   A = Least likely that it would have someone using this option. With strong working knowledge in advance they will know the correct methods of formula in this case, as well as have better critical thinking with application of logical statements to identify and self-correct a 'silly' solution/choice.
*   B = Essentially negligible by now,
*   C = Largest proportion
*   D = With more critical evaluation, better to be safe than sorry. Advanced will use this logic if they don't spot anything right away.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=60% D=25%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=72% D=25%
