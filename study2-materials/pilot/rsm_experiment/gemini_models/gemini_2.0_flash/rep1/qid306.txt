Okay, I'm ready to simulate the results based on my experience grading Year 9 mock exams. Here's my prediction for each ability level:

**Reasoning:**

*   **Problem P: 4 - 5 + 6**  This tests understanding of order of operations (left to right when only addition/subtraction is present).
*   **Problem Q: 4 + 5 x 6** This tests understanding of BIDMAS/PEMDAS (Multiplication before Addition).
*   **Error Analysis:**
    *   **Option A:** The mistake in both P and Q is adding first (or subtracting from left without multiplication first).

**Predicted Response Percentages:**

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=75% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
