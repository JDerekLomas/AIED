Here's my breakdown of likely student responses, based on years of seeing common errors in similar index questions.

* **Understanding the core concept:** The key here is understanding that a negative number raised to an even power will be positive. Many students struggle with this, particularly early in Year 9. Also, understanding the power relates to repeated multiplication, not simply multiplying -3 and 4.

* **Common Errors:** The big traps are forgetting the negative sign, misunderstanding powers (and just multiplying), and potentially struggling with calculator use involving negative numbers.
