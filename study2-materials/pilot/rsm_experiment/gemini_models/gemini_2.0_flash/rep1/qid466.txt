Okay, here's my prediction based on experience of marking Year 9 mocks in the UK, after staring at similar fractional nightmares on 200 papers!

Here's the error analysis I did *before* estimating percentages:

*   **Correct Answer:** A) 4/3

*   **Error leading to B) -4/3:** Students correctly identify that the inverse involves flipping the fraction and understand you need a fraction 4/3. However, they forget or incorrectly apply the negative sign rule - that multiplying two negatives produces a positive, and to get a negative one number needs to be positive and the other negative, to arrive at a negative one. So they assume a -4/3 is needed instead of a +4/3. (Attractive Error)

*   **Error leading to C) 3/4:** Forget entirely that to undo multiplication by a fraction, you need to divide, which involves taking the reciprocal. The simply choose the 3/4 ignoring the need to get the inverse, thinking maybe that you subtract it when you do a reverse sum to make it equal.

*   **Error leading to D) -3/4:** Confuse the question and use the original numbers, not completing an actual calculation. They may even think they need a fraction of the same size and the second negative. They might also misunderstand what the term replace means. (Also attractive if students aren't properly engaged).

Here are the estimated percentages for each ability level:

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
