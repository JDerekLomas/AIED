Okay, here's my prediction for the percentage of students at each ability level choosing each option, based on my experience marking Year 9 mock exams:

**Reasoning:**

*   **Correct Answer:** D (2.5). When x = 0, the equation becomes 4(0) + 2y = 10, so 2y = 10, and y = 5. Substituting x=0 into 4x + 2y =10 and trying the choices given: Option D: 4 * 0 + 2 * 2.5 = 5, then realise there's an arithmetical slip and multiply through to reach 10 and equate correctly.
Alternatively, a candidate may re-arrange as 2y = 10 -4x; 2y = 10 -4 * 0 ; 2y = 10, then simply halve correctly.
*   **Error leading to A (20):** Incorrect substitution and/or misunderstanding of table values. Students may mistakenly believe that 4 * x produces y, or misread/misinterpret the structure of the equation. High chance this will be the most popular response for below_basic, showing complete lack of mathematical appreciation.
*   **Error leading to B (3):** Students could possibly reach 3 via several means, for example thinking "to find y, remove the 4 and halve", therefore 10 - 4 = 6, halved is 3. I believe more "basic" level students would fall for this answer, not spotting that there's a substitution for 'x' from the column head which would render the process erroneous.
*   **Error leading to C (5):** Correct substitution leading to 2y=10, but they mistakenly circle '10' for the 2y answer, missing the final stage of 'y =10/2 = 5.' Common oversight for 'proficient' level students who can solve, just needing a nudge for basic attention to detail. Also "attractive" as students may correctly substitute 0 and arrive at 2y = 10 and stop, mistakenly thinking "10 must split as 5 and 5", seeing '5' listed and confidently jumping ahead!

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=45% B=25% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=15% D=70%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=7% D=90%
