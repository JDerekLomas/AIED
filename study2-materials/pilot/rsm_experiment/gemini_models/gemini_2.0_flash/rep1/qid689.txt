Okay, I'm ready to provide my predictions based on years of marking Year 9 mock exams, focusing on the common errors students make with equations like this.

Here's how I think students at different ability levels would respond:

*   **Error Analysis**

    *   **A (p=0.5):** This arises from incorrectly dividing 5 by 10 instead of vice-versa or a misunderstanding of manipulating the fraction. It is also often asssociated with seeing division when multiplication is the solution, perhaps starting with 10/5 as the initial operation

    *   **B (p=50):** This results from multiplying 10 and 5, showing a misunderstanding of inverse operations and potentially confused the concept of proportion, seeing the numerator on one side, the denominator of the unknown, and simply multipliying those to "balance".

    *   **C (p=2):** This is the correct answer. Solving by either:

        *   Multiplying both sides by *p*, getting 10*p* = 5, then dividing by 10 to give *p* = 0.5

    *   **D (There are no solutions):** Usually selected when there is uncertainty/a dislike for algebraic manipulation or an unfamiliar format

*   **Predictions:**

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=5% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=75% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=96% D=1%
