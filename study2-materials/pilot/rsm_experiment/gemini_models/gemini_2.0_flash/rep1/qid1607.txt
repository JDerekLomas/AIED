Okay, here's my prediction for the percentage of students at each ability level choosing each option for that question, based on common errors I've seen in Year 9 mocks.

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=5% D=55%
basic: A=55% B=5% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=15% B=5% C=70% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=0% C=95% D=3%

**Reasoning:**

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level struggle with inverse operations and arithmetic. They are likely to follow the first step and correctly see the x4 action. But they would mess up -1 with 60-k = to something high. Many would incorrectly select 'D' because algebraic manipulations are shaky, or choose 'A' because Step 1 'looked' ok and algebra always has one wrong answer.
*   **Basic:** This level shows an improvement. Many of them will manage to get the Step one operation correct, and a smaller amount can carry to Step 2 without getting an answer near the original - and think of one step being incorrect. Leading to a higher rate of selecting "A", and many will recognise a incorrect subtraction and will think that there's something up. The students are still quite prone to arithmetical mistakes here.
*   **Proficient:** Students here generally understand inverse operations and are able to execute them reasonably accurately. So they know that each stage needs to occur, but small arithmetical mistake or simple sign will catch them. Likely they just re-work the whole question in this circumstance
*   **Advanced:** Students at this level will have strong skills in the required topics and understand where the students likely error occurs, knowing the basics well and the mistakes from other levels. With good numerical skills, they'll almost always work out that *both* steps in this scenario are logically consistent/mathematically possible. Most mistakes from overconfidence or tiredness!
