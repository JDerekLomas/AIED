Here is the breakdown based on 200 marked scripts.

**The rationale behind the errors:**
*   **A (20):** This is the **"Inverse Operation Failure."** Students correctly reach the stage $2y = 10$ but, lacking confidence in division or conceptual understanding, they default to multiplication ($10 \times 2$). This is distinctively a below-basic error.
*   **B (3):** This is the **"Fear of Zero"** trap. When substituting $x=0$, students at the basic level often incorrectly write $4 \times 0 = 4$ (keeping the number) rather than $0$. This results in $4 + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 6 \rightarrow y = 3$. Alternatively, a student glances at the wrong column header and solves for $x=1$.
*   **D (2.5):** This is the **"First Number Syndrome"** or **"Intercept Swap."** Students either grab the first coefficient they see (4) and divide 10 by it ($10 \div 4$), or they accidentally solve for the x-intercept (setting $y
