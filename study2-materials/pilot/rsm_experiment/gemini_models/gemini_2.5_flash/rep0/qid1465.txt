The correct answer is: $3-5+4 \times 2 = 3-5+8 = -2+8 = 6$. So, A is the correct answer.

Here's my breakdown by ability level:

**Error Analysis:**
*   **A) 6:** Correct answer. Requires correct order of operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS) and confident arithmetic with positive and negative integers.
*   **B) 4:** Likely $3-5+4 \times 2 \rightarrow 3-5+8 \rightarrow -2+8 = 6$. How to get 4? This would be $3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 = -2 + 4 \times 2 = -2 + 8 = 6$. Or perhaps $3 - 5 + 4 = 2$. Then $2 \times 2 = 4$. This is a major BODMAS violation (left-to-right evaluation including the final multiplication, or maybe even $3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 = 3 - 9 \times 2 = 3 - 18 = -15$, no, or $3 - 5 + 4 = 2$ and then somehow get $2 \times 2=4$. The error here would be performing addition before multiplication or $3-5=-2$, $-2+4=2$, $2\times2=4$. This is an "attractive" error of doing it strictly left to right after the subtraction.
*   **C) -12:** Could be $3-5+4 \times 2 \rightarrow 3-(5+4) \times 2 \rightarrow 3-9 \times 2 \rightarrow 3-18 = -15$. Or perhaps $3-5=-2$, $-2+4=2$, then $2 \times 2$ - wait this makes 4. So if doing strictly left-to-right without BODMAS: $3-5 = -2$. $-2+4 = 2$. Then $2 \times 2 = 4$. This makes B. To get -12: $(3-5+4)\times 2 = (-2+4)\times 2 = 2 \times 2 = 4$. Or $(3-5)\times 4 + 2 = -2 \times 4 + 2 = -8+2 = -6$. Not 12. Could be $(3-5+4)\times 2$ is $2\times 2 = 4$. It suggests either calculation of $5+4\times 2 = 18$ giving $3-18=-15$ but sign errors get us to -12, or even simpler $3-5+4\times 2 \rightarrow 3-5= -2 \rightarrow -2+4=2 \rightarrow 2\times 2 = 4$. What about $3 - 5 + (4 \times 2) = 3 - 5 + 8$. Maybe they get $3-5=-2$, then do $2 \times (-2)=-4$ then add $4$. This is convoluted. It might be $3-(5+4) \times 2 = 3-9 \times 2 = 3-18 = -15$. It's a distractor but might trap a few who struggle with negatives. Or they did $5+4=9$, then $3-9 = -6$, then $-6 \times 2 = -12$. This is a left-to-right plus "group the sum" error.
*   **D) -10:** Very likely $3-5 = -2$. Then $-2+4 = 2$. Then $2 \times 2$ ... This produces 4. If they do $3-5 = -2$, then $5+4=9$, $9\times 2 = 18$, and then $3-18$ is not 10. Could be $3-(5+4\times 2) = 3-(5+8) = 3-13 = -10$. This is a plausible and "attractive" error: they've grouped the addition *before* the multiplication within the implied bracket, thus correctly identifying $4\times 2$ first. They respect BODMAS partly.
*   **Other common errors leading to none of the above:** Just left to right: $3-5=-2$. $-2+4=2$. $2 \times 2 = 4$. This is option B.

My analysis for common errors:
1.  **Strict Left-to-Right:** $3-5 = -2
