Here's my prediction based on common errors seen in Year 9, specifically relating to the mean and handling the number zero:

**Error Analysis:**

*   **A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \)**
    *   **Calculation Error:** Forgetting to include the '0' in the sum.
    *   **Why attractive:** Some students mistakenly think '0' doesn't contribute to the sum or doesn't need to be added, especially when summing positive integers. They've included the '0' when counting *how many* numbers there are, but not when *adding* them. This is a subtle but common misunderstanding of how '0' impacts an average.
    *   **Who falls:** Primarily Basic and some Proficient who rush or have a slight misunderstanding of zero's role in a sum for an average.

*   **B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \)**
    *   **Calculation Error:** Misunderstanding order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). They are dividing *only the 7* by 5, not the entire sum. They see the division sign and don't realise it applies to the total sum.
    *   **Why attractive:** It *looks* like a sum and then a division, mimicking the structure of the mean. However, the lack of brackets is key. Students often forget that 'sum first, then divide' means either using brackets or a fraction line.
    *   **Who falls:** Mostly Below Basic and Basic students who struggle with notation and order of operations. They might even recognise it's *wrong* but struggle to articulate why, or assume the calculator will 'know' what they mean.

*   **C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \)**
    *   **Calculation Error:** Forgetting to include the '0' both in the sum AND in the count of how many numbers there are. This implies a complete disregard for '0' as a data point.
    *   **Why attractive:** This is a strong distractor for students who genuinely believe '0' means "nothing there" and should be entirely ignored. It feels 'correct' if you delete the 0 from your mental list of numbers entirely.
    *   **Who falls:** Below Basic and Basic students who have a fundamental misunderstanding of zero's place in a dataset for averaging. This is often the most common "zero" error.

*   **D) None of them**
    *   **Why attractive:** This is the correct answer. The mean should be \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \). None of the options achieve this.
    *   **Who falls:** Proficient and Advanced students who carefully check each option and apply the correct formula for the mean, including zero properly, and understand the implications of order of operations and counting.

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=30% B=10% C=10% D=50%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
