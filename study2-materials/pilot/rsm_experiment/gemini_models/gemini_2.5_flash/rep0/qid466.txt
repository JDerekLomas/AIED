**Analysis of Common Errors and Student Thinking:**

*   **Correct Answer (A: 4/3):** This requires understanding reciprocals and that the product of a number and its reciprocal is 1. Since the original number is negative, and the target is -1, the "star" must be the *positive* reciprocal.
    *   `(-3/4) * (4/3) = -12/12 = -1`
    *   This is often done by conceptualizing it as `-3/4 * x = -1`, so `x = -1 / (-3/4) = 1 / (3/4) = 4/3`.

*   **Option B (-4/3):** This is the reciprocal, but the student has incorrectly thought that multiplying by the reciprocal also means changing the sign. Or, they have started by writing `x = -1 / (-3/4)`, and then somehow incorrectly ended up with `-(4/3)`. They might remember "change sign and flip" but apply the change sign wrongly. A common error here is to just see `-3/4 * x = -1`, identify `x` as `4/3` but then add the negative sign, resulting in `-4/3`, as `(-3/4) * (-4/3) = 1`. This leads to a sign error of +1 instead of -1.
    *   *Error*: Flipped correctly, but incorrectly maintained or applied the negative sign (resulting in `(-3/4) * (-4/3) = +1`). This is an attractive distractor for students who are nearly there but stumble on the sign rule.

*   **Option C (3/4):** This indicates a complete misunderstanding of reciprocals, possibly thinking that to get 1, you just need the "same numbers" or are getting confused with subtraction rules for fractions, or thinking it's the number itself.
    *   *Error*: No flipping of the fraction. Just keeping the positive form of the number, or maybe thinking `x / x = 1` for something, and confusing the operations. `(-3/4) * (3/4) = -9/16`. Very far off.

*   **Option D (-3/4):** This is just the original number. The student hasn't applied any reciprocal concept. This might be a guess, or thinking `x * x = x`, or being very lost.
    *   *Error*: No reciprocal applied. Possibly just writing down the original fraction, maybe thinking `x * 1 = x`, and being confused. `(-3/4) * (-3/4) = 9/16`.
