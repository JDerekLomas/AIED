Here's my prediction based on marking hundreds of these at Year 9:

Thinking process:

*   **Correct answer (B):** Needs accurate multiplication of all four terms (m*m, m*-7, -5*m, -5*-7) and correct collection of like terms. (m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35). The key "trap" students fall into is the sign of the last term and the sign of the middle term.

*   **Option A (\(m^{2}-2 m-35\)):**
    *   `m^2`: Correct.
    *   `-35`: Indicates -5 * +7 OR -5 * 7. In this case, it means they might have made one of the following sign errors for the last term, OR more likely, simply calculated -5 * 7 and forgot about the other negative. This is a common error with -a * -b = -ab instead of +ab.
    *   `-2m`: Comes from -7m + 5m (one of the original terms was +5 instead of -5, or an error in subtraction: -7 - 5 = -2, not -12). OR, more common, simply adding the numbers: -5 + -7 = -12, and then flipping a sign or doing 7-5=2 but keeping the largest negative sign which would make it -2. Very attractive if students see "5 and 7 make 12" and then "5 and 7 make 2" as an alternative error for 7-5.

*   **Option C (\(m^{2}+12 m+35\)):**
    *   `m^2`: Correct.
    *   `+35`: Correct for -5 * -7.
    *   `+12m`: This error comes from either (+5m) + (+7m) if they ignored the signs completely and just made everything positive, or a sign error during addition: (-7m) + (-5m) = +12m instead of -12m. This is a common "make everything positive" or a simple sign flip error.

*   **Option D (\(m^{2}-12 m-35\)):**
    *   `m^2`: Correct.
    *   `-12m`: Correct from -7m - 5m.
    *   `-35`: This is the classic error where -5 * -7 is seen as -35 instead of +35. "Two negatives make a negative". This is extremely common at all ability levels, as it's a fundamental sign error.

**Student Breakdown:**

*   **Below Basic:** Often struggle with FOIL entirely, making multiple errors. Sign errors are rampant. Option D is tempting due to the common - * - = - error. Option A for simple arithmetic errors and sign issues. May also pick C if they "positive" everything.
*   **Basic:** Understand the concept of FOIL but struggle significantly with negative signs, especially in multiplication. Option D (last term sign error) and C (middle term sign error) are prime candidates. They know the `m^2` and the `-12m` part of D often, but not `+35`. They are easily lured by a common sign mistake.
*   **Proficient:** Generally get the concept but are prone to one common sign error, particularly - * - = - . They're unlikely to make errors with `m^2` or the value `12` for the middle term, but the sign of `12m` or `35` could still trip them. D is the most attractive trap for proficient students. C is less likely. A is rare unless a simple slip.
*   **Advanced:** Expected to get this correct. Errors would be very rare and usually a careless mistake (e.g., misreading -5 as +5 initially). Option D is the *only* plausible error for this group, as it's a common (though incorrect) rule of thumb some briefly revert to under exam pressure.

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
