Here's my prediction for a Year 9 mock exam based on typical errors and ability levels for the question $y = 3x^2$ when $x = 0.3$.

**Thought Process:**

*   **Correct Answer Logic:** $y = 3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. This is **Option B**.

*   **Option A) 0.81:** This comes from $(0.3)^2 = 0.09$, but then doing $0.3 \times 3 = 0.9$ (ignoring the squaring part for 0.3 but applying it elsewhere, or just seeing $0.3 \times 0.3 \times 3$ and getting muddled) or $3 \times (0.3^2)$ where they miscalculate $0.3^2$ as $0.9$. *However, the most direct path to 0.81 is $3 \times (0.3 \times 0.9) = 3 \times 0.27$, which is not a direct error, or $ (0.3)^2 \times 9$, no. Actually, it's just $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = (0.9)^2 = 0.81$. This is a very common BODMAS error - squaring the result of $3 \times 0.3$ instead of squaring $0.3$ first.* This is a *very* attractive error.

*   **Option C) 1.8:** This comes from $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, then either doubling it ($0.9 \times 2 = 1.8$) for no good reason or misinterpreting the square as 'times two', i.e. $3 \times 0.3 \times 2 = 1.8$. Or possibly $3 \times 0.6$ (thinking $0.3^2 = 0.6$, another error). Less direct than A or D.

*   **Option D) 2.7:** This comes from $3 \times 3 \times 0.3 = 2.7$. (i.e. doing $3^2 \times 0.3$). Or a significant calculation error involving powers of 10. Or just $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, then trying to multiply by 3 somehow without a firm grasp of $x^2$. Often $3 \times 0.9$ without proper working of $0.3^2$. *The most common pathway to 2.7 is $(0.3 \times 10) \times 0.9$, or $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, then somehow $(0.9) \times 3$, or they forget the decimal point so $3 \times 3^2 = 27$, then incorrectly placing a decimal point.* The most attractive path for the 'no idea' student might be to move the decimal point around for the answer of 27. It also has a '3' in it. $3 \times (0.3 \times 10) = 0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$. No, it's $(3 \times 0.3)$ and then $(0.3)^2 = 0.09$. Or it's $3 \times (0.3 \times 0.3 \times 10)$. Let's rethink D. If they did $3^2 = 9$ then $9 \times 0.3 = 2.7$. This is *another* highly attractive BODMAS error. $3x^2$ vs $(3x)^2$.

*   **BODMAS errors are rife:** $(3x)^2$ vs $3x^2$.
    *   $(3x)^2 \Rightarrow (3 \times 0.3)^2 = (0.9)^2 = 0.81$ (Option A)
    *   $3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$ (Correct, Option B)
    *   $x^2 \times 3$ (where $x^2$ is mistakenly calculated as $x \times 2$ or they just misinterpret the $0.3$ operation entirely).

**Revisiting Error Sources based on Year 9:**

*   **$(3x)^2$ error:** $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, then $(0.9)^2 = 0.
