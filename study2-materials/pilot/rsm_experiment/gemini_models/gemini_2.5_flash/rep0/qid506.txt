Here's my prediction based on common errors seen in Year 9, especially when fractions are involved:

**Understanding the errors:**

*   **Correct answer:** \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\). To solve for p, we divide both sides by 3. This means \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\).
*   **A) \( p=\frac{1}{4} \)**: This error comes from multiplying the 3 by the denominator instead of the numerator or incorrectly simplifying. For example, some might see \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) and think \(p = \frac{3 \times 1}{12}\) (but why?) or misinterpret "dividing by 3" as multiplying the fraction by 3, so \(3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\). This is a strong distractor for students who are uncomfortable with dividing by a whole number when a fraction is present.
*   **B) \( p=\frac{1}{36} \)**: This is the correct answer. Students demonstrate a good understanding of inverse operations with fractions.
*   **C) \( p=4 \)**: This is a classic "flipping" error or just misremembering fraction rules. Some students might incorrectly "invert" \( \frac{1}{12} \) to 12, then divide by 3 to get 4. Or, they might see the denominator 12 and multiply by 3, thinking it's the inverse. This error indicates a very weak understanding of fractions and equations.
*   **D) \( p=\frac{1}{9} \)**: This could arise from trying to "balance" the fraction, e.g., if you have \( \frac{1}{12} \), maybe they think \( \frac{1}{4 \times 3} \). If you have 3p, perhaps they thought \( p = \frac{1}{3 \times 3} \). It's a less common but still possible misinterpretation, often from those struggling to recall multiplication facts with fractions. Another way to get here is dividing 12 by 3, but putting the result as the *numerator* while keeping the 1 from the original numerator as the denominator for some reason.
