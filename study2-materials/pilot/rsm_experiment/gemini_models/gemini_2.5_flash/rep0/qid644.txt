Let's break down the question and the likely student thought processes.

The question asks for the product of the two terms indicated by the arrows: (-1) and (-4).
The correct answer is (-1) * (-4) = +4.

Let's consider the distractors:
*   **A) +4:** Correct answer. Product of two negative numbers.
*   **B) -4:** This is (-1) * (+4) or (+1) * (-4). It shows an understanding of multiplying the *magnitudes* but failing to apply the sign rule for two negatives correctly, or seeing one as positive.
*   **C) +5:** This is the result of *adding* the numbers, (-1) + (-4) = -5, but then making an error with the sign, or perhaps seeing it as (1) + (4). Could also be from an incorrect calculation or misinterpreting the question.
*   **D) -5:** This is the result of *adding* the numbers, (-1) + (-4). Students confuse multiplication with addition.

Now, let's predict the percentages for each ability level:

*   **Below Basic:**
    *   Many will likely add rather than multiply.
    *   Sign errors are very common.
    *   Could interpret "multiply" very loosely.
    *   Confusion between 1 * 4 and 1 + 4 will be rife.
    *   They might get B by seeing (-1) * 4 but failing on the double negative.
    *   D is a strong contender as it's the result of incorrect addition with correct signs.
    *   C might come from adding and then making a sign error or adding 1 and 4 to get 5.
    *   A will be low.
below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=30% D=35%

*   **Basic:**
    *   Understand they need to multiply.
    *   Sign rules for multiplication of negative numbers are a common stumbling block here.
    *   Many will correctly identify 1 * 4 = 4.
    *   The crucial step is remembering "negative times negative is positive." This is where many will err.
    *   B is a very "attractive" distractor for this group – they get the magnitude but mess up the sign rule.
    *   Some might still add if they rush or misread.
basic: A=45% B=40% C=5% D=10%

*   **Proficient:**
    *   Mostly understand multiplication of directed numbers.
    *   A small percentage might still make a mental slip under pressure (e.g., getting B).
    *   Should confidently get the correct answer.
    *   Likely to quickly identify the product is +4.
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%

*   **Advanced:**
    *   This is a fundamental concept for expanding brackets. They should have full mastery.
    *   Mistakes would be exceedingly rare, possibly a clerical error or momentary lapse.
    *   Should achieve 100% accuracy, possibly with one or two individuals making a freak error.
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
