Okay, 200 papers marked, coffee brewing, ready to delve into the minds of my Year 9s. This mixed number addition question is a classic. It tests understanding of converting mixed numbers, finding common denominators, and adding fractions/integers separately or together, then simplifying or converting back to a mixed number. Lots of places for a common error.

Let's break down each option:

**The Correct Answer:**
\( 2 \frac{7}{10}+2 \frac{1}{4}= \)
Method 1: Add integers, then fractions
\( 2+2=4 \)
\( \frac{7}{10}+\frac{1}{4} = \frac{14}{20}+\frac{5}{20}=\frac{19}{20} \)
Result: \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \)

Method 2: Convert to improper fractions first
\( 2 \frac{7}{10}=\frac{27}{10} \)
\( 2 \frac{1}{4}=\frac{9}{4} \)
Common denominator (20):
\( \frac{27 \times 2}{10 \times 2} = \frac{54}{20} \)
\( \frac{9 \times 5}{4 \times 5} = \frac{45}{20} \)
Add: \( \frac{54}{20}+\frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} \)
Convert to mixed number: \( \frac{99}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20} \)

**Analysis of Options and Common Errors:**

*   **A) \( \frac{99}{20} \)**
    *   This is the *improper fraction* form of the correct answer. The question asks for a *mixed number*. Many students will correctly perform the addition as improper fractions but forget or fail to convert back, especially under time pressure or if they've struggled with that conversion previously. It shows understanding of the core addition.

*   **B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \)**
    *   **This is the correct answer.** Students demonstrating full understanding of all steps: converting (mentally or explicitly) to common denominators, adding fractions and whole numbers (or improper fractions and converting back), and presenting the answer in the required format.

*   **C) \( \frac{99}{40} \)**
    *   This is a common error with finding the *lowest common multiple (LCM)* for the denominator. Students multiply the denominators (10 x 4 = 40) instead of finding the LCM (20). If they did that, then converted their original fractions (7/10 = 28/40, 1/4 = 10/40), added the numerators (28+10=38), and also added the whole numbers (4), they'd have \( 4 \frac{38}{40} \).
    *   *However*, the \( \frac{99}{40} \) option is more likely if they've converted to improper fractions first, *then* made a mistake with common denominators for a second time, or possibly tried to just add denominators. The numerator of 99 indicates they've managed the \( 54+45 \) (from \( \frac{54}{20} \) and \( \frac{45}{20} \) which implies the 20 was correctly used as denominator *somewhere* for conversion, then perhaps they multiplied 20 by 2, or just wrote down 40 as the denominator out of habit. A common specific error here would be adding improper fractions like this: \( \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} \) and accidentally doing \( \frac{27 \times 4 + 9 \times 10}{10 \times 4} = \frac{108 + 90}{40} = \frac{198}{40} \). If they then divided 99 by 2, or made another error reducing it... It's more likely they added the fractions directly *and* accidentally used 40 as the common denominator without adjusting numerators, then stuck 4 as whole number - but the answer C isn't 4 whole ones.
    *   *Rethink C*: The \( \frac{99}{40} \) result suggests they *did* convert to improper fractions (27/10 and 9/4). They then multiplied the denominators \( 10 \times 4
