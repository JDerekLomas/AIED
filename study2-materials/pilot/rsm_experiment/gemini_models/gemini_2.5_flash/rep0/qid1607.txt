Here's my prediction based on common Year 9 errors and reasoning patterns:

*   **Understanding the correct solution:**
    *   **Step 1:** Multiply both sides by 4. \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \), so \( 60 = 1+k \). This step is *correct*.
    *   **Step 2:** Subtract 1 from both sides. \( 60 - 1 = k \), so \( 59 = k \). Isaac wrote \( 61=k \). This step is *incorrect*.
    *   Therefore, the correct answer is A.

*   **Analysis of incorrect options/attractive errors:**
    *   **Option C (Both steps are correct):** This implies thinking \( 60-1=61 \) or simply not checking the arithmetic. This is a very common arithmetic error for many students, especially when subtracting a small number from a larger one or simply not being careful.
    *   **Option B (Only step 2):** This would mean thinking \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \rightarrow 60 = 1+k \) is wrong, but then thinking \( 60 = 1+k \rightarrow 61=k \) is right. This implies confusion about inverse operations for division/multiplication, *and* making the \(+1\) arithmetic error. Less likely to choose B for both errors.
    *   **Option D (Both steps are incorrect):** This would suggest fundamental confusion with inverse operations, maybe subtracting 4 instead of multiplying, and then making an error in the second step too.

*   **Student behaviour by ability level:**

    *   **Below Basic:** Many struggle with multi-step equations and inverse operations. Arithmetic errors are rife. Might jump to a conclusion, or guess. The "add instead of subtract" error leading to 61 is very attractive. Might misinterpret the first step entirely.

    *   **Basic:** Understands inverse operations generally, but often makes careless arithmetic errors. Step 1 (multiplying by 4) is generally understood. The \( 60-1 \ne 61 \) error is the prime culprit here. Many will see "60=1+k" and automatically add, making it 61. They might *feel* both steps are right without proper checking.

    *   **Proficient:** Good understanding of inverse operations and usually careful with arithmetic. They'll correctly identify step 1 as correct. They will spot the \( 60-1=59 \) required and thus \( 61=k \) is wrong. They might second-guess themselves or take a moment to be sure.

    *   **Advanced:** Confidently identifies the correct inverse operations and performs arithmetic accurately. Checks their work. This is a straightforward "spot the mistake" question for them.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%
