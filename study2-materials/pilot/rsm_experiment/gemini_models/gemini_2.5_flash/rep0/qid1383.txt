Okay, 200 papers marked... my hand is cramping. Let's dig into this T = k^4 question. It's a classic for catching sign errors and misinterpretations of powers.

Here's my breakdown of what I'd expect to see from Year 9s across different ability levels:

**Option Analysis:**

*   **A) 81:** Correct answer. Requires understanding that \( (-3)^4 = (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \). An even power of a negative number results in a positive number.
*   **B) 12:** Incorrect. This is likely \( -3 \times 4 \) (ignoring the negative sign, or just a multiplication error of -3 x 4 = 12, then thinking that's the answer) or similar muddled operation. A very common "I don't know what to do with a power" error where they multiply the base by the exponent. Or \( 3 \times 4 \).
*   **C) -81:** Incorrect. This comes from calculating \( 3^4 = 81 \) and then incorrectly applying the negative sign from k, leading to \( -(3^4) \) or \( (-3) \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 \) (conceptual error on power) or thinking an even power of a negative number should always be negative. This is the *most attractive* distractor for students who understand powers but struggle with negative numbers.
*   **D) -12:** Incorrect. This is \( -3 \times 4 \). Similar to B, but they correctly maintain the negative sign when performing the incorrect multiplication operation.

**Ability Level Predictions:**

below_basic: A=05% B=40% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=02% C=15% D=03%
advanced: A=98% B=00% C=02% D=00%
