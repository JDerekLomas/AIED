Here's my prediction based on marking hundreds of Year 9 papers for this type of question:

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A) p = 0.5 (Correct Answer):** This requires multiplying both sides by p, then dividing by 10. Or, understanding that 10 and p swap places due to inverse operations.
*   **B) p = 50:** This error comes from multiplying 10 by 5, assuming p is on the numerator or forgetting to invert. `10 * 5 = 50`. Often, students think `10 = 5p`, so `p=50`. This is an *extremely* common and attractive error for lower ability students, especially if they are used to `x/5 = 10` where they multiply.
*   **C) p = 2:** This error comes from `5 / 10 = 0.5`, but then misinterpreting 0.5 as `1/2` and potentially making an error, or just dividing 5 by 10 directly and getting confused. Or seeing `10 = 5/p` and thinking `p = 10/5` or `p = 5-10`.
*   **D) There are no solutions:** This is rare, unless the student is completely lost or confused by the fraction form. Sometimes students confuse "no solutions" with undefined operations (e.g., division by zero, but `p` isn't `0` here). It might also be a 'wild guess' when completely unsure.

**Student Behaviour at Different Levels:**

*   **Below Basic:** Struggle with rearranging equations, especially involving fractions and division. The concept of the variable being in the denominator is a major hurdle. Will often perform an operation they've seen (like multiplying the two numbers) without understanding the algebraic implications. The idea of "what do I do with the 10 and the 5?" will often lead to `10*5` (giving 50) or `10/5` (giving 2). Swapping for `p` on the denominator is a high-level jump for them.
*   **Basic:** Some will make the error in B. Others will know they need to "get p out from underneath," but then might incorrectly isolate it. A significant proportion might just see numbers and want to multiply them. Will likely perform `5/10` to get 0.5, but not know it relates to `p`.
*   **Proficient:** Should get this correct. If they make an error, it will usually be a momentary lapse or transcribing error, possibly picking 2. The jump from `10 = 5/p` to `10p = 5` and then `p = 5/10` is generally well-understood.
*   **Advanced:** Should consistently get this correct with confidence. Any error would be an uncharacteristic mistake, perhaps miscalculating 5/10, but that's unlikely.

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=25% D=5%
basic: A=30% B=45% C=20% D=5%
