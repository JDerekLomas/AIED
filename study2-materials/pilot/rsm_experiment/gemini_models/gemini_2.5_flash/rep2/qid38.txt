Thinking Process:

1.  **Understand the Question:** The question requires adding two algebraic fractions and simplifying. The key steps are finding a common denominator, converting the fractions, adding, and then checking for simplification.

2.  **Correct Solution:**
    *   Find common denominator for \( \frac{3}{2 x} \) and \( \frac{4}{x} \). The LCD is \( 2x \).
    *   Convert \( \frac{4}{x} \) to an equivalent fraction with denominator \( 2x \): \( \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{8}{2x} \).
    *   Add: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \).
    *   The correct answer is A.

3.  **Analyze Each Distractor:**

    *   **A) \( \frac{11}{2 x} \):** This is the correct answer. Students who understand common denominators and basic fraction addition will get this.

    *   **B) \( \frac{7}{3 x} \):**
        *   How to get this: \( (3+4) / (2x+x) \). This is a classic "add numerators, add denominators" error, compounded by also incorrectly adding the \(x\) terms in the denominator.
        *   Attractiveness: Very attractive to students who fundamentally misunderstand fraction addition and also algebraic term addition.
        *   Who makes this error: Primarily below basic, but some basic students who panic or have major misconceptions.

    *   **C) \( \frac{11}{x} \):**
        *   How to get this: This implies correctly getting \( \frac{11}{2x} \) and then incorrectly "simplifying" by dividing the 2 out of the denominator when it shouldn't be (e.g., seeing \( \frac{11}{2x} \) and thinking the '2' cancels with an 'x' or that the '2' isn't needed). OR it comes from \( \frac{3+8}{x} \), where the \(2\) from \(2x\) is somehow ignored in the denominator but still used in making \(4/x\) into \(8/2x\), which is less likely.
        *   A more plausible route: Find common denominator as \(x\), making \( \frac{3}{2x} \) into \( \frac{3/2}{x} \), then add \( \frac{3/2}{x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3/2 + 4}{x} = \frac{3/2 + 8/2}{x} = \frac{11/2}{x} = \frac{11}{2x} \). If they incorrectly 'cancelled' the 2 in the denominator from here, or perhaps did \(3 + 4 = 7\) and then incorrectly dealt with the \(x\)s.
        *   Let's re-evaluate C. It could also come from doing \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \) but then having a deep misconception that the '2' in the denominator of \( \frac{11}{2x} \) just means 'half of x', and not truly a part of the denominator. Or they got \( \frac{11}{2x} \) but then saw the answer as just \( \frac{11}{x} \) from options.
        *   *Alternative derivation for C:* Some students might get the numerators correct as 11, but get confused by the 2x vs x in the denominator. They might think "just make the denominators x". This could happen if they view 2x and x as distinct, and just choose 'x' as common, then only multiply 4 by x, or something similar leading to incorrect calculation of denominator or numerator. Or simply ignoring the 2, assuming the common denominator is 'x'. This means \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} \) -> wait no. If they ignore the 2, it's \( \frac{3}{x} + \frac{4}{x} \) for example which would give \( \frac{7}{x} \).
        *   Let's think of how one could legitimately end up with an 'x' denominator but an '11' numerator. If they used \(x\) as the common denominator: \( \frac{3/
