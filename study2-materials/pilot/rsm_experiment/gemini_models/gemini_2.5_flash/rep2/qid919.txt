Here's my breakdown, having marked countless Year 9 papers!

The core task is $3 \times (0.3)^2$.

Let's consider the errors:
*   **Error for A (0.81):** $0.3^2 = 0.09$, so $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. For A to be the answer, the student might calculate $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$. This is a PEMDAS/BODMAS error, doing the multiplication before the exponentiation. Very common!
*   **Error for B (0.27):** This is the correct answer.
*   **Error for C (1.8):** This could come from a couple of errors. The most likely is $3 \times (0.3 \times 2) = 3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$, misunderstanding squaring as multiplying by 2. Another possibility is a slip with $0.3^2 = 0.09$, so $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ (not C) or $3 \times 0.6$ (if they just ignored the squaring, $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, so maybe $3 \times 0.6$ thinking about 'double 0.3'? A bit convoluted). Let's stick with the "multiply by 2" misinterpretation. Or perhaps $3 \times 3 \times 0.2$ or similar? I actually find C quite an outlier, but perhaps it arises from something like $3 \times (0.3)^2$, but making the exponent $0.6$ or $0.3 \times 6$? It could be $3 \times (0.3+0.3) = 1.8$? Or $3 \times (0.3/0.2)$, I think the most common is $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.81$ and another $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, which does not fit. Another path to C: Maybe they think of $0.3^2$ as $0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$, so $3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$. Yes, this is the most attractive for C.
*   **Error for D (2.7):** $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. Perhaps $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$. So this error comes from thinking $(0.3)^2 = 0.3$, then multiplying by $3$ again? Or calculating $0.3^2 = 0.9$ (which is wrong), then $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$. The idea $0.3^2 = 0.9$ is an attractive 'mis-move' ($3 \times 3 = 9$, then stick a decimal point in a random spot). Or they calculated $3 \times (0.3)^2$ where $0.3^2=0.9$ ($0.3 \times 3$ error not squaring)? Let's go with $0.3^2 = 0.9$ (the error is $0.3 \times 3$ instead of $0.3 \times 0.3$) so $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$. Or they cube 0.3 ($0.027$) and multiply by 100 ($2.7$). But the common error for D is the 'ignoring the decimal point' when squaring then putting it in the wrong place for 0.3, or just thinking $0.3 \times 3$.

Let's refine:
*   **A (0.81):** $ (3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81 $. A classic order of operations (BODMAS) error. Squaring the *product* of $3 \times 0.3$.
*   **B (0.27):** Correct. $3 \times (0.3 \times 0.3) = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.
*   **C (1.8):** $3 \times (0.3 \times 2) = 3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$. Misunderstanding $x^2$ as $x \times 2$. Very common for $x^2$ and $x^3$.
