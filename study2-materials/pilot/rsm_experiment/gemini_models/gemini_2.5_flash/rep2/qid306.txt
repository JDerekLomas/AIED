Okay, 200 papers marked. My hand's cramping, but these BODMAS questions always throw up some interesting insights. Let's break it down by ability level.

**Problem P: \( 4-5+6= \)**
The key here is that subtraction and addition have equal precedence. You work left to right. So, \( 4-5 \) is the first calculation.
Correct part for P: \( 4-5 \)

**Problem Q: \( 4+5 \times 6= \)**
This is a straightforward BODMAS/BIDMAS application. Multiplication comes before addition. So, \( 5 \times 6 \) is the first calculation.
Correct part for Q: \( 5 \times 6 \)

Therefore, the correct overall answer is **B**.

Let's consider the common errors:

*   **Option A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \)**
    *   P is correct.
    *   Q is incorrect (doesn't follow BODMAS, just left-to-right). This is a very common 'just read it left-to-right' error.

*   **Option C: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \)**
    *   P is incorrect (attempts to do addition before subtraction without considering signs or order, perhaps thinking 'positive numbers first' or simply 'see a plus, do it next').
    *   Q is incorrect (doesn't follow BODMAS). This is 'left-to-right' on Q, and 'do the positive bits next' on P.

*   **Option D: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \)**
    *   P is incorrect (attempts to do addition before subtraction without considering signs or order).
    *   Q is correct. This choice implies understanding BODMAS for Q but struggling with the left-to-right rule for operations of equal precedence in P. The \(5+6\) on P is "attractive" because it's a positive addition, maybe trying to avoid negative numbers or just following "A before S" blindly (without understanding equal precedence and left-to-right for same-level operations).
