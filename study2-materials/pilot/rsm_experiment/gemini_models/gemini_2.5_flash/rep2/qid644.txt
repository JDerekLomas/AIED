Let's break down this question and the common errors.

**Correct Answer:** The arrows point to the constant terms: -1 and -4. Multiplying these gives (-1) * (-4) = +4. So, A is the correct answer.

**Analysis of Incorrect Options:**

*   **B) -4:** This would be the answer if students correctly multiplied the numbers (1 and 4) but made an error with the signs, either forgetting that "minus times minus is plus" or just taking the sign of one of the numbers.
*   **C) +5:** This is a classic "adding instead of multiplying" error: -1 + (-4) = -5, but then forgetting the signs and just adding the absolute values (1 + 4 = 5). Or perhaps a double sign error from -1 + (-4) to get -5, and then forgetting to multiply but making a sign error to get +5. Less likely than -5.
*   **D) -5:** This is a very common error – adding the terms instead of multiplying them: (-1) + (-4) = -5. This is an attractive distractor for students who are not fully clear on the 'F O I L' acronym or the difference between collecting like terms and expanding brackets.

**Predicting Performance:**

*   **Below Basic:** Many would struggle with the multiplication concept itself, defaulting to addition. Sign errors are almost guaranteed for multiplication, even if they attempt it.
*   **Basic:** Some will get it right. Many will make the addition error, or correctly multiply 1x4 but fail with the signs. The "-5" error is particularly strong here.
*   **Proficient:** The majority should get this correct. Some may still make a lapse with signs or briefly default to addition but catch themselves.
*   **Advanced:** Should be a near 100% correct response. Any errors would be extremely rare slips rather than conceptual misunderstandings.
