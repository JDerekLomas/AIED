Let's break down the common mistakes for this type of BODMAS question.

**The Correct Answer Breakdown:**
The correct order of operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS) dictates:
1. Multiplication first: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Then additions and subtractions from left to right:
   \(3 - 5 + 8\)
   \(-2 + 8\)
   \(6\)

So, A) 6 is the correct answer.

**Common Wrong Answers and Associated Errors:**

*   **B) 4:** This comes from ignoring the order of operations completely and just doing calculations from left to right, OR mixing up and doing 3-5 then 4x2 then -2+8 = 6
    *   Left to right: \(3 - 5 = -2\). Then \(-2 + 4 = 2\). Then \(2 \times 2 = 4\). This is a very common 'attractive' error for students who haven't internalised BODMAS.
    *   This is the *most attractive* error for below basic and basic students who often learn "left to right" or struggle with negative numbers after the left-to-right calculations.

*   **C) -12:** This suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of negative numbers and/or BODMAS, often making the multiplication negative, or incorrect arithmetic with negatives.
    *   Possibility 1: \(3 - 5 = -2\). Then \(-2 + 4 = 2\). Then doing \(2 \times (-2)\) because they see a minus somewhere else: \(2 \times (-2)\) isn't in the expression, or \(2 \times 2\) but thinking it needs to be negative? No, most likely an error involving thinking of 5+4, then multiplying this somehow or incorrectly applying the sign of the 5.
    *   More likely: A student struggling significantly with operations would perhaps do: \(3 - 5 = -2\). Then mistakenly group \((4 \times 2) = 8\), and then \( -2 - 8 = -10 \) which isn't an option either.
    *   Let's reconsider \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). A possible route to -12:
        *   \(5 + 4 = 9\) (grouping terms incorrectly). Then \(3 - 9 \times 2\).
        *   \(9 \times 2 = 18\). Then \(3 - 18 = -15\) (not -12).
        *   What about if they group \(5+4=9\), then do \(3-(9 \times 2) = 3 - 18 = -15\).
        *   Perhaps they did \(3-5 = -2\), then did \(4 \times 2 = 8\), but instead of \(-2+8\), they did \(-2 \times 2 = -4\), then perhaps \(-4-8=-12\). This is complex and suggests very muddled thinking.
        *   A simpler route to -12: Perhaps they do \(5+4=9\), and \(3-9 = -6\), then they might apply multiplication at the end (but incorrectly): \(-6 \times 2 = -12\). This is possible, ignoring the order for \(4 \times 2\). This error (performing all addition/subtraction, then multiplication last regardless of order) is plausible.
        *   Another very confused student might see the "4 times 2" as "minus 4 times 2" as they scan the expression. If they do \(3-5 = -2\), then do \( -4 \times 2 = -8\). Then they add them \(-2 + (-8) = -10\). Not -12.
        *   Let's assume the error is: Add all numbers without regard to order or operation: \(3+5+4+2 = 14\), and then suddenly decide it's negative or make an arbitrary error? Unlikely to systematically lead to -12.
        *   The most probable pathway to -12 is misinterpreting the "minus" sign:
            *   Student does \(3-5 = -2\).
            *   Then \(4 \times 2 = 8\).
            *   They might interpret "plus 8" as "minus 8" because there's a negative earlier. So, \(-2 - 8 = -10\). Still not -12.
            *   Consider this
