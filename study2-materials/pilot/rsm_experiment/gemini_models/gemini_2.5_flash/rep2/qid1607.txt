Let's break down the thinking for each ability level, anticipating common errors and attractions.

The correct steps are:
Step 1: Multiply both sides by 4. \( 15 \times 4 = \frac{1+k}{4} \times 4 \implies 60 = 1+k \) (Correct)
Step 2: Subtract 1 from both sides. \( 60 - 1 = 1+k - 1 \implies 59 = k \) (Incorrect, Isaac *added* 1)

So, the correct option is A.

**Predicted Error Analysis:**

*   **Step 1 error:** Most common mistake would be dividing by 4, or subtracting 4, or doing nothing to the 4. However, multiplying by 4 is a very fundamental first step in clearing denominators, so many students (even lower ability) would attempt it correctly.
*   **Step 2 error (Isaac's error):** Adding 1 instead of subtracting 1. This is a very common sign error when isolating a variable. Students see \( 1+k \) and instinctively move the 1 by adding it, rather than understanding it's a positive 1 that needs to be subtracted to get rid of it. This is a high-frequency error across all but the very best students.
*   **Catching errors:** Proficient and advanced students should catch Isaac's sign error in Step 2. Below basic and basic students might not, especially if they are focused on 'moving' numbers rather than performing inverse operations.
