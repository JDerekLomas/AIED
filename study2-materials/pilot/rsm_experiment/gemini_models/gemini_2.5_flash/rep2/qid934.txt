Here's my prediction based on my experience of common errors at Year 9, specifically considering how tempting each wrong answer is:

**Understanding the problem:**
The student needs to substitute x=0 into the equation 4x + 2y = 10 and then solve for y.
4(0) + 2y = 10
0 + 2y = 10
2y = 10
y = 5

**Analysis of each distractor:**

*   **A) 20:**
    *   Error: Treats 2y as if it's 2+y OR makes an arithmetic error with multiplication.
    *   Could come from: 4(0) + 2y = 10 => 2y = 10 => y = 10 / 2 (correct step here), but then some students might think 'times by 2 so it's 10 * 2 = 20'.
    *   Or, students might confuse 2y with (4x + 2) * y. No, this isn't very likely.
    *   More likely is: if 2y = 10, then they multiply by 2 instead of dividing by 2 to isolate y, perhaps remembering "do the opposite" but applying it incorrectly. This is a common algebra misconception. 10 * 2 = 20.
    *   Or, they didn't substitute at all and thought y=4x (incorrectly looking at 4x and then assuming the relation is simple direct proportionality, maybe reading the 2y as '2 multiplied by 0 gives 0, so ignore the 2y part'). Unlikely given the equation is present.

*   **B) 3:**
    *   Error: Subtracts 2 from 10 instead of dividing by 2. This suggests a misunderstanding of what '2y' means (seeing it as 2+y rather than 2*y) OR a confusion in applying inverse operations: 'take away' for multiplication.
    *   4(0) + 2y = 10 => 2y = 10 => y = 10 - 2 = 8. (Not an option)
    *   Wait, let's re-evaluate '3'. Where could 3 come from?
        *   Possibly: they did 10 / 2 = 5, but then for some reason tried to put 0 into 4x as well and got confused, or picked a random number that 'felt right' if they were guessing.
        *   Another source of '3' might be from an unrelated mental arithmetic error or a guess. If 2y=10 then 10-2=8. Not 3.
        *   What if they somehow confused it with '2' + 'y' = 10, then y=8? Or '2' multiplied by something = 10, something = 5.
        *   Perhaps, students might solve 4x = 10 - 2 = 8 (wrong calculation for x=0 substitution) or might get 2y = 10, then go (10-4)/2 (bringing the 4 back).
        *   Could also come from "what multiplies by 2 to make something around 10...3,4,5... maybe 3"?
        *   Most likely origin: Incorrectly tries to work backwards with an equation like x + 2 = 10. For y, 2 + y = 10, then y = 8. Not 3.
        *   Let's assume the error is related to basic algebra: they know 2y = 10. Some common errors with this are: 10 - 2 = 8.
        *   **Aha! If they see 4x + 2y = 10, and put x=0, then 2y = 10. They might see "2" and "10" and think about something like 2x + Y = 10, which leads to 8. This is tough to pin down.**
        *   Consider the distractors: 20 (clearly 10x2), 5 (correct), 2.5 (clearly 5/2). '3' stands out as less derived from a direct error in calculation from '2y=10'.
        *   What if they misread 4x+2y=10 as 4+x+2+y=10 and put 0 for x so 4+0+2+y=10 so 6+y=10
