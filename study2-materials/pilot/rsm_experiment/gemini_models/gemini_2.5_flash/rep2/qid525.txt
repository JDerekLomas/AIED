This is a lovely question that really probes understanding of fraction operations, and I can already feel the pain of seeing common mistakes pop up again and again in those 200 papers.

Let's break down the thought process for each option and ability level:

**The Correct Answer: B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \)**
To get this, students need to:
1.  Recognise they can add the whole numbers: \( 2+2=4 \)
2.  Find a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{7}{10} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \). The LCM of 10 and 4 is 20.
3.  Convert the fractions: \( \frac{7}{10} = \frac{14}{20} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{20} \)
4.  Add the fractions: \( \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20} \)
5.  Combine the whole and fraction parts: \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \)
*Alternatively, convert to improper fractions, find common denominator, add, then convert back. This is often more prone to calculation errors with larger numerators.*
\( 2 \frac{7}{10} = \frac{27}{10} = \frac{54}{20} \)
\( 2 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} = \frac{45}{20} \)
\( \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} \)
Then \( \frac{99}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20} \)

**Distractor Analysis:**

*   **A) \( \frac{99}{20} \)**
    *   This is the correct answer but left as an improper fraction.
    *   Many students who use the improper fraction method (as described above) will get this.
    *   The prompt specifically asks for a *mixed number*, so while mathematically equivalent, it's not strictly following instructions.
    *   However, if a student arrives at this and doesn't convert, they've done most of the heavy lifting. The question says "Leave your answer as a mixed number" *but doesn't say "only"* a mixed number. Often, if a question *strictly* enforces formatting, students lose marks, but here it might pass with partial credit for the mathematical accuracy. For MCQ, it's just the wrong *option*.
    *   Students using the whole number method (Option B) won't get this.
    *   Some proficient/advanced students might write this first and then convert it, so it's a stepping stone, but not their final answer if they double-check the question's format.

*   **C) \( \frac{99}{40} \)**
    *   This results from adding numerators and denominators without finding a common denominator for *all* terms in the calculation, or (more likely) using a common denominator of 40 (which works for the initial improper fractions \( \frac{27}{10} = \frac{108}{40} \) and \( \frac{9}{4} = \frac{90}{40} \)), then accidentally adding \( 27+9=36 \) for the numerator, instead of using their converted fractions or starting improperly.
    *   More probably, this error occurs for those who convert to improper fractions:
        \( 2 \frac{7}{10} = \frac{27}{10} \) and \( 2 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \).
        They find a common denominator (LCM of 10 and 4) which is 20.
        They convert to \( \frac{54}{20} \) and \( \frac{45}{20} \).
        They then somehow, incorrectly, get \( \frac{99}{40} \). This isn't from adding numerators \(27+9\) and denominators \(10+4\) as that gives \(\frac{36}{14}\) (reducible to \(\frac{18}{7}\)).
        Perhaps they convert to \( \frac{54}{20} \) and \( \frac{45}{20} \), then for some reason multiply the denominators again *after* converting the numerators. So \( \
