Here's my prediction for student responses based on the question and my experience marking Year 9 papers, particularly focusing on the application of BIDMAS/BODMAS.

Let's break down the question first:
Left side: \( 8+12 \div 4 \)
Applying BIDMAS: \( 8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11 \)

Right side: \( (8+12) \div 4 \)
Applying BIDMAS: \( (20) \div 4 = 5 \)

So, the comparison is \( 11 \square 5 \), which means \( 11 > 5 \). The correct answer is A.

Common errors:
*   **Ignoring order of operations on the left side:** Students might just calculate from left to right: \( 8+12 = 20 \), then \( 20 \div 4 = 5 \). This makes both sides equal to 5, leading to option C. This is a *very* common and "attractive" error as it simplifies the mental load.
*   **Careless calculation:** Less common for a question this simple, but always a possibility.
*   **Misunderstanding inequality symbols:** Some students mix up \( > \) and \( < \), even if they correctly calculated the numbers.

**Ability Level Breakdown:**

*   **below_basic:** Students at this level often have a fragile grasp of BIDMAS, frequently applying operations from left to right without much thought. They are very prone to the "left-to-right" error. They might also confuse the inequality signs.
    *   **A (>):** Unlikely unless a lucky guess, as it requires correct application of BIDMAS.
    *   **B (<):** A common guess or confusion if they got the values correct but mixed up the sign.
    *   **C (=):** Extremely likely due to the left-to-right error on the left side. This is the dominant wrong answer.
    *   **D (>=):** Purely a guess as it implies equality could also be true, which would come from the C error, but then why not just pick C? Very low probability.
*   **basic:** Students here might know BIDMAS exists but are prone to slip up under exam pressure or if they are rushing. The "left-to-right" error is still highly probable for the first expression, but they might catch themselves more often. They are also less likely to confuse the inequality signs.
    *   **A (>):** Achievable, but the common pitfall is very tempting.
    *   **B (<):** Less likely than C, as they should be able to identify 11 vs 5 correctly even if they miscalculated the 11.
    *   **C (=):** Still very strong, as it comes from a natural (but wrong) way to process the first expression. Many students in this category might get stuck on \(8+12 \div 4\) if they aren't explicitly thinking "BIDMAS".
    *   **D (>=):** Almost negligible.
*   **proficient:** Students at this level are generally secure with BIDMAS for this level of question. They should correctly identify 11 on the left and 5 on the right. Their errors would mostly be careless mistakes in symbol choice (though unlikely) or a very fleeting lapse in concentration for the BIDMAS rule.
    *   **A (>):** The clear majority.
    *   **B (<):** A very rare slip in transcribing the inequality sign, possibly.
    *   **C (=):** Indicates a major conceptual misunderstanding for a proficient student; highly unlikely. If chosen, it suggests they actually belong in a lower category for this topic.
    *   **D (>=):** Negligible.
*   **advanced:** These students are fully confident and fluent with order of operations. They would correctly calculate both sides and confidently choose the correct inequality.
    *   **A (>):** Near certainty.
    *   **B (<):** Almost impossible for a concept this fundamental at their level.
    *   **C (=):** Implies a profound misstep in basic arithmetic understanding; essentially impossible for this category.
    *   **D (>=):** Negligible.

Here are the predictions:

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
