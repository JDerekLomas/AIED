Okay, Year 9 fractions, a perennial favourite for revealing gaps in conceptual understanding! Let's break this down.

**Analysis of Answers:**

*   **Correct Answer: B) \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \)**
    *   Steps:
        1.  Add whole numbers: \( 2+2=4 \)
        2.  Find common denominator for fractions: \( \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20} \)
        3.  Combine: \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \)

*   **Distractor A) \( \frac{99}{20} \)**
    *   This is the correct answer, but written as an improper fraction. Students might have correctly done the sum, but then not converted to a mixed number OR seen it as an improper fraction and worried they had to pick that format. This implies a lack of confidence in final presentation or not fully reading "Leave your answer as a mixed number." It could also come from converting both mixed numbers to improper fractions *first* (which is a valid strategy), getting \( \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} \), and then *forgetting or failing* to convert to a mixed number. This is a very strong distractor for proficient students who might take the improper fraction route.

*   **Distractor C) \( \frac{99}{40} \)**
    *   This implies a common error with common denominators, often seen as simply multiplying the denominators without adjusting the numerators correctly, or some attempt at finding a denominator (e.g. \( 10 \times 4 = 40 \)) but then messing up the subsequent numerators in a specific way that leads to 99, *or* more likely, finding an L.C.M of 40 (instead of 20) and then the full calculation (converting to improper fraction first \( \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{108}{40} + \frac{90}{40} = \frac{198}{40} \)), which simplifies to \( \frac{99}{20} \), then simplifying incorrectly to 40 instead of 20? No, much more likely:
    *   Students simply multiplying the original denominators: \( \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} \), mistakenly thinking they should *multiply* fractions or multiplying denominators without adjusting the numerator properly for the lowest common multiple, *or* (more likely with mixed numbers) converting to improper, and making a L.C.M. error: \( \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} \). If they incorrectly thought the LCD was 40 but *still added the numerators directly* i.e., \( \frac{27+9}{10+4} \rightarrow \) NO, that's not it.
    *   The most plausible error here for 99/40 is the 'adding fractions without a common denominator' or 'incorrect common denominator then adding numerators' strategy. e.g. trying to find the common denominator and incorrectly doing \( \frac{7+1}{10+4} \) or \( \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} \rightarrow \frac{7+1}{lcm(10,4)=40?} \). No, if you did \( \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} \), and correctly found 40 as *a* common multiple (not necessarily the lowest), then \( \frac{108}{40} + \frac{90}{40} = \frac{198}{40} \). If you then incorrectly simplified, e.g. divided only numerator by 2, and the denominator by something else, or made a mistake after reaching \( \frac{198}{40} \), you could get this. More likely: A complete breakdown on finding common denominators, maybe just summing numerators and denominators or something similar and accidentally getting 99/40 through random numbers. Or trying to find the sum of fractions, getting \( \frac{19}{20} \) for fractions, then making an error. This is a significantly harder error to pin down systematically. Perhaps attempting to sum the numerators \( (2
