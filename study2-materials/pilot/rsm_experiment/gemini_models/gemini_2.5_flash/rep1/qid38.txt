My thoughts before predicting:

*   **Correct answer pathway:** Find a common denominator (2x). Convert the second fraction to 8/2x. Add numerators (3+8=11). Keep the denominator (2x). Result: 11/2x.
*   **A) \( \frac{11}{2 x} \)** This is the correct answer.
*   **B) \( \frac{7}{3 x} \)**
    *   Error 1: Adding numerators (3+4=7).
    *   Error 2: Adding denominators (2x + x = 3x).
    *   This is a very common "add fractions by adding numerators and adding denominators" error. It's attractive because it's simpler than finding a common denominator. Students who are weak on fraction addition rules will default to this.
*   **C) \( \frac{11}{x} \)**
    *   Error 1: Correctly found a common denominator of 2x, so the expression becomes (3 + 8)/2x. So far so good (11/2x).
    *   Error 2: Simplification error. Student may incorrectly "cancel" the '2' in the denominator with something that isn't there in the numerator, or perhaps just thinks simplifying means getting rid of a number to make it 'nicer'. Or maybe they did 3/x + 4/x after seeing a 2x and just thinking 'x' is common. If they correctly converted 4/x to 8/2x, and then just *mistakenly* thought the final denominator was 'x', then 3/x + 8/x would be 11/x. This is less likely if they actually wrote down 11/2x and then simplified. It's more likely if they had a flawed idea of the common denominator from the start and just 'skipped' the 2. *Alternatively, maybe they found the common denominator correctly as 2x, then added 3+8=11. Then, when writing it out, accidentally dropped the 2.* I think the "dropping the 2" from the denominator at the last step is more plausible for some.
*   **D) \( \frac{7}{2 x} \)**
    *   Error 1: Correct common denominator identified as 2x.
    *   Error 2: Failed to convert the second fraction. They did (3 + 4)/2x, treating it as if it were 3/2x + 4/2x, meaning they didn't multiply the numerator 4 by 2 when converting 4/x to 8/2x. This is a very common error among students who *understand* the idea of a common denominator but struggle with *applying* the equivalence operation to the second fraction's numerator. This feels very attractive for students who are half-way there.

**Ability Level Breakdown Thoughts:**

*   **Below Basic:** Very likely to just add numerators and denominators. Will probably pick B. A small fraction might try for a common denominator but make fundamental errors. D is also very likely as it shows a glimmer of common denominator thinking but the numerator calculation is still wrong.
*   **Basic:** Understands common denominators but often makes errors in calculating equivalent numerators. D is a very strong candidate for this group. Some might still fall for B if they are very rushed or weak on fractions. A good proportion will get it right.
*   **Proficient:** Should largely get this correct (A). Any errors would be slips or slight misunderstandings of the second fraction conversion (leading to D), or a very careless final write-down (possibly C, dropping the 2).
*   **Advanced:** Should get this correct. Any error would be an extreme lapse in concentration (a very rare mistake).

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=85% B=0% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
