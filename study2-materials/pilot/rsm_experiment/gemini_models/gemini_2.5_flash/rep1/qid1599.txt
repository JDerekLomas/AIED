Here's my prediction based on marking hundreds of Year 9 papers:

**Thinking Process:**

*   **A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \)** This is the correct answer. It shows the division of 'c' by the entire expression '(h+4)' as a single fraction.
*   **B) \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)** This is a distracter. It correctly places the 'h+4' in the denominator but adds 4 to the numerator 'c', implying \( (c+4) \div (h+4) \). This might arise from seeing '4' in the question and trying to incorporate it "everywhere" or misunderstanding that the 'c' is just 'c' and not 'c + something'. Less likely, it could be a misreading of \( c + 4 \div (h+4) \) if that was a setup. It's a "throw an extra 4 in there" type of error.
*   **C) \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)** This is a very common and "attractive" error for students who struggle with order of operations or the implication of brackets. They see \( c \div h \) and then separately see '+4'. They incorrectly distribute the division or simply forget the priority implied by the brackets, effectively performing \( (c \div h) + 4 \). This directly ignores the bracket rule.
*   **D) \( \frac{h+4}{c} \)** This is an inversion error. Students confuse dividend and divisor, flipping the fraction. They know division can be written as a fraction, but get the top and bottom swapped. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of 'a divided by b'.

**Ability Level Predictions:**

*   **Below Basic:** Many in this group will be overwhelmed by the notation. Option C looks simpler or more 'broken up', while D is a common inversion mistake. B is also a guess. Some might pick A but more out of luck.
    *   **C: Highest draw.** They struggle with "divide by the *whole thing*". They see \( c \div h \) and then the +4 as a separate operation.
    *   **D: Second highest draw.** Fundamental confusion of division order.
    *   **B:** A guess to include the 4 in another place.
    *   **A:** Likely by chance or a 'best guess' among equally confusing options.
*   **Basic:** They'll understand fraction notation for division, but the brackets still pose a challenge for many. The "add 4 later" (C) will still be a strong distracter, but fewer inversion errors.
    *   **A: Some will get it.** They recall that the denominator represents the "divide by" part.
    *   **C: Still a significant error.** This group still struggles with the implications of brackets on algebraic fractions, often splitting it up.
    *   **D: Fewer errors than below basic.** They generally understand \( x \div y \) means \( \frac{x}{y} \).
    *   **B: Least attractive.** The adding '4' to the numerator feels less "algebraic" and more like an invention.
*   **Proficient:** The majority in this group should get this correct. They understand order of operations and how brackets dictate that 'h+4' must be treated as a single quantity for division.
    *   **A: High success rate.** Solid understanding of convention.
    *   **C: Small percentage.** These might be moments of mental lapse or forgetting the importance of brackets when translated to fractions.
    *   **D, B:** Very few errors here. These are more fundamental errors they've generally overcome.
*   **Advanced:** Almost perfect understanding. Any error here would be a rare slip, a hurried mistake, or possibly misreading 'h+4' for 'h+c' or similar.
    *   **A: Near perfect.**
    *   **C:** Extremely rare error. Maybe a mental blank or rushed reading.
    *   **D, B:** Essentially non-existent for this group on this type of question.

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=45% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%
