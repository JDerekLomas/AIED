Here's my prediction based on marking hundreds of Year 9 papers, specifically looking at how they manipulate formulae and deal with cubes and cube roots.

First, let's establish the correct approach:
1. Volume of a sphere: \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \)
2. Isolate \( r^3 \):
   \( 3V = 4 \pi r^3 \)
   \( \frac{3V}{4 \pi} = r^3 \)
3. Take the cube root:
   \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4 \pi}} \)
So, C is the correct answer.

Now, let's analyse the errors for each option:

**Option A) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \mathrm{~cm} \)**
*   Error: Inverting the fraction incorrectly. Instead of multiplying by 3 and dividing by 4π, the student multiplies by 4π and divides by 3. Essentially, \( r^3 = V \times \frac{4\pi}{3} \) or \( r^3 = V \div \frac{3}{4\pi} \) rather than \( V \div \frac{4}{3}\pi \). This is a common error when rearranging. They've essentially multiplied V by the original \( \frac{4}{3}\pi \) rather than dividing V by it.

**Option B) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \mathrm{~cm} \)**
*   Error: This is similar to A but slightly different in where the \( \pi \) lands. It suggests the student did \( V \div \frac{3}{4\pi} \), perhaps thinking \( \pi \) goes with the denominator rather than staying with the numerator from the \( \frac{4}{3} \pi \). Or perhaps they divided V by \( \frac{3}{4} \) and by \( \pi \) separately. This error keeps \( \pi \) in the denominator, but gets the fraction part wrong (4/3 rather than 3/4). This shows a struggle with algebraic manipulation of fractions.

**Option D) \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \mathrm{~cm} \)**
*   Error: The most significant error here is taking the cube root of V *before* rearranging the entire formula. It suggests:
    \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \)
    \( \sqrt[3]{V} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4}{3} \pi} \times r \) (This step itself is problematic for them)
    \( r = \frac{\sqrt[3]{V}}{\sqrt[3]{\frac{4}{3}\pi}} \) which could then lead to complex algebraic errors to get this form.
    More likely, they got \( \frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3 \) and then simply put a cube root over V only, e.g. \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4\pi} \), thinking the cube root applies only to V and not to the constant part of the rearranged term. This is a common "piece-meal" approach to cubing/cube-rooting in algebra. Or they incorrectly applied \( \sqrt[3]{ab} = \sqrt[3]{a} \sqrt[3]{b} \) but then got stuck. This option doesn't cube root the *entire* rearranged side, which is a fundamental misunderstanding.
