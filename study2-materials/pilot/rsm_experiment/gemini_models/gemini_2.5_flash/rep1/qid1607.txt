Let's break down this question and the common student errors.

The correct solution:
Starting equation: \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \)
Step 1: Multiply both sides by 4. \( 15 \times 4 = 1+k \) so \( 60 = 1+k \). This step is *correct*.
Step 2: Subtract 1 from both sides. \( 60 - 1 = k \) so \( 59 = k \). Isaac's Step 2 says \( 61=k \), which implies he *added* 1 instead of subtracting. So Step 2 is *incorrect*.

Therefore, the correct option is A) Only step 1.

Now, let's consider the attractive wrong answers and typical student behaviour.

**Analysis of Errors:**

*   **Error for Option B (Only Step 2 correct):** This implies thinking Step 1 is wrong (which it isn't). A common error in Step 1 might be multiplying 15 by 4 and then adding or subtracting the 1, or dividing by 4 instead of multiplying. However, the calculation \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) is quite straightforward. If they thought 60 = 1+k was incorrect, but 61=k was correct, it's a very muddled understanding of equations, or a specific focus on the 'final' answer (61) as potentially correct from a lucky previous error.

*   **Error for Option C (Both steps are correct):** This is a huge trap. The multiplication by 4 is done correctly in Step 1. Then, to get from \( 60=1+k \) to \( 61=k \), one would have to *add 1* to 60. This is a classic transposition error where students see '+1' on one side and apply '+1' on the other, rather than applying the inverse operation (subtract 1). It's a very common algebraic misconception at this stage. Students might check their answer by substituting k=61 back into 1+k/4, which would give 62/4 = 15.5, so they would realise it's wrong IF they check. But many won't check, or they might make a mistake checking. The calculation \( 60+1=61 \) feels "easy" and a continuation of the positive numbers, so it feels natural for some.

*   **Error for Option D (Both steps are incorrect):** This would indicate a very poor understanding of solving equations. Either they get 60 = 1+k wrong and then get the 61=k wrong too. Or they make errors in calculating 15 * 4, then also the final step. Less common if they correctly follow a standard solving method (even if the sign is wrong).

**Predicting by Ability Level:**

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the fundamental idea of inverse operations. They might get tripped up by the fraction in the initial equation, or be confused by the 'k' on the right. The adding vs subtracting '1' will be a major stumbling block. They might guess.
    *   They are highly likely to fall for the "add 1" trap because it's a number that's 'there'.
    *   They might also struggle with Step 1 and choose D.

*   **Basic:** These students understand the general idea of solving equations but are prone to specific errors, especially sign errors or transposing. They can usually multiply by 4 correctly but are very susceptible to the Step 2 error.
    *   Option C is a huge magnet for them. They see Step 1 as a sensible way to get rid of the denominator, then often make the very common mistake in Step 2.

*   **Proficient:** These students generally know how to solve equations and typically avoid the simple sign errors under normal circumstances. They can usually identify Step 1 as correct without hesitation. They should be able to identify the error in Step 2 by doing the inverse operation correctly.
    *   They *should* choose A. A small number might rush and fall for C if they don't explicitly think through the inverse operation for Step 2.

*   **Advanced:** These students have a solid understanding of algebraic manipulation. They would identify Step 1 as a correct application of multiplying both sides by 4 and quickly spot that adding 1 instead of subtracting 1 in Step 2 is incorrect. They would double-check their own logic if unsure.
    *   They will almost exclusively choose A.
