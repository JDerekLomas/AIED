**Reasoning for Predictions:**

*   **Understanding the Question:** This question tests understanding of multiplicative inverses (reciprocals), particularly with negative numbers. The product of a number and its reciprocal is 1. The product of a number and its *negative* reciprocal is -1.

*   **Correct Answer (A: 4/3):** To get -1 from multiplying \( -\frac{3}{4} \), the star must be the *reciprocal* of \( \frac{3}{4} \) (which is \( \frac{4}{3} \)) AND positive, because a negative multiplied by a positive equals a negative.

*   **Common Error 1 (B: -4/3):** This shows understanding of the reciprocal but a mistake with the sign. Students might incorrectly think "negative times negative equals negative" (should be positive) or "to get -1, I must include another negative". This is a very attractive distractor.

*   **Common Error 2 (C: 3/4):** This is either students getting confused by the reciprocal idea altogether and thinking the answer is the original fraction without the negative, or just guessing. Some might associate the "inverse" operation with subtraction, not multiplication, or simply ignore the -1 goal.

*   **Common Error 3 (D: -3/4):** Similar to C, this shows little understanding of the reciprocal, essentially thinking it's the original number again. It's often a "throw-in" answer when students are completely stuck, or they misunderstand "what should replace the star" as simply putting the original number back. Some might incorrectly apply an additive inverse idea (-3/4 + 3/4 = 0, so maybe something like that for -1?).
