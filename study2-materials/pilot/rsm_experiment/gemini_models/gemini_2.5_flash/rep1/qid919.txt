Rationale for predictions:

*   **Correct Answer: A) 0.27**
    *   Calculation: \(y = 3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\).

*   **Distractor Analysis:**
    *   **A) 0.81**: This comes from calculating \((3 \times 0.3)^2 = (0.9)^2 = 0.81\). This error applies the square to the entire product (3x) rather than just x. This is a common misinterpretation of \(3x^2\).
    *   **B) 0.27**: Correct.
    *   **C) 1.8**: This could be \(3 \times 0.3 \times 2\) (multiplied by 2 instead of squared) which is \(0.9 \times 2 = 1.8\). Or it could be \((3 \times 0.3) + 3 \times 0.3\) (repeated addition thinking squared is double). Less likely but plausible. Perhaps also \((0.3)^2 = 0.09\), and \(3 \times 0.9 = 2.7\), but then mistake \(2.7\) for \(1.8\) if it was an earlier question using this value... Unlikely.
    *   **D) 2.7**: This comes from \(3 \times 0.3^2 = 3 \times 0.3 = 0.9\) or \(3 \times (0.3 \times 3) = 3 \times 0.9 = 2.7\), but where the decimal point is misplaced in the squaring part. Alternatively, it comes from \(3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09\) but then \(3 \times 9 = 27\) and placing decimal incorrectly. Or even more simply, it's \(3 \times 3 \times 0.3 = 2.7\). This shows misunderstanding of powers entirely, or poor decimal multiplication.

*   **Ability Levels and Error Patterns:**
    *   **Below Basic:** Struggle with order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and decimal squaring. Might choose answers that feel numerically larger or simply guess. Misinterpreting \(x^2\) for \(x \times 2\) or just making basic arithmetic errors with decimals. The attraction of a simple (3 x 0.3) squared might be strong.
    *   **Basic:** Understand BIDMAS/BODMAS to an extent but likely make a decimal place error or apply the square incorrectly (e.g., to the entire term 3x). They understand \(0.3^2\) means \(0.3 \times 0.3\), but often get \(0.9\) or \(0.09\) but misplace decimal when multiplying by 3. The \(0.81\) option (incorrect order of operations) is a huge trap here.
    *   **Proficient:** Understand order of operations and squaring of decimals. They're primarily checking for calculation errors. Will typically get it right. Some might rush and make a simple decimal place error or momentarily misapply the square (but should catch it).
    *   **Advanced:** Should consistently get this correct. They have strong command of BIDMAS/BODMAS, decimal operations, and scrutinise their answers. If they get it wrong, it's a very rare careless error or a momentary mental lapse.
