Here's my prediction based on marking hundreds of Year 9 papers for this type of question:

**Understanding the question and typical errors:**

*   **Goal:** Find 'y' when x = 0 in the equation 4x + 2y = 10.
*   **Correct method:** Substitute x = 0: 4(0) + 2y = 10 => 0 + 2y = 10 => 2y = 10 => y = 5.
*   **A) 20:** This is likely 4 * x (when x=1 in the next column for some reason?) or just seeing "4" and "10" and perhaps multiplying, or mistaking the relationship between the coefficients and the constant. Highly attractive for very weak students who see numbers but no clear path. Or possibly *y* is found using x=4, the last value in the table: 4(4) + 2y = 10 => 16 + 2y = 10 => 2y = -6 => y = -3. Then ignoring the negative. Not as likely for 20. Another thought: could they be using a value for y somewhere (e.g. from the formula 2y=10, they just swap and go 2*10=20)
*   **B) 3:** If students misread "4x" as just "4" or struggle with multiplication by zero: 4 + 2y = 10 => 2y = 6 => y = 3. This is a very common error for weaker students failing to deal with "4x" correctly when x=0, or not seeing that 4*0 is 0.
*   **C) 5:** Correct answer.
*   **D) 2.5:** This comes from dividing the constant by *both* the coefficients without first substituting x=0, i.e., 10 / (4+2) = 10/6 ≈ 1.67 (less likely). More plausibly, it's half of the constant without considering 4x at all (10/4 = 2.5, if they focused on "4x=10") or if they divided 10 by 4, not 2. A more likely route: maybe they think 4x + 2y = 10 means 4 + 2y = 10, so 2y = 6, y = 3. OR, 4x = 10, so x = 2.5 (this is what is *in the question* - they solve for x, but are looking for y) This makes sense for those who confuse variables or just try to 'solve for a letter'. Or possibly, if they simplify 4x + 2y = 10 to 2x + y = 5 and then substitute x=0 gives y=5 (correct). If they simplified differently? No, the correct simplification should lead to the correct answer. The 2.5 suggests a division of 10 by something, often 4 (4x = 10, then x = 2.5) rather than 2y=10. This is a classic "solving for the wrong variable" or "misreading what the 4 refers to" error.
