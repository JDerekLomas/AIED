Here's my prediction based on marking hundreds of Year 9 papers and seeing where common misconceptions lie with expanding brackets and negative numbers.

Let's break down the answers first:
*   **Correct answer (B): -4.** This requires multiplying -1 by +4, remembering that a negative times a negative equals a positive. Wait, rereading the question. "multiplies the two terms indicated by the arrows". The arrows are pointing at -1 and -4. So (-1) * (-4) = +4. Oh dear, careful reading from me too! Let's correct this immediately.

    *   **Correct answer (A): +4.** This requires multiplying (-1) by (-4). A negative times a negative equals a positive. This is a fundamental rule often tested.

*   **B) -4:** This is a very attractive distractor. It comes from (-1) * (+4) if they didn't see the negative sign on the 4 or simplified too quickly. Alternatively, it might be seen if they simply added -1 + (-4) and forgot the rule for multiplying negatives. Or they remembered "negative * negative = positive" for numbers but messed up the sign (e.g., knew it was 1x4=4, then picked a sign). Another thought: (-1) + (-4) = -5. So if they thought it was addition, then got the value but the wrong sign?
    *   No, I need to stick to the actual numbers presented. The arrows indicate -1 and -4.
    *   If a student correctly identifies 1 x 4 = 4 but thinks a negative times a negative is a negative. This is a common error.

*   **C) +5:** This could come from adding 1 + 4. Ignoring the signs, or thinking the signs only matter for the 'result' sign and just adding the absolute values. Unlikely for multiplication.

*   **D) -5:** This is likely from adding the terms: -1 + (-4) = -5. This indicates confusing addition/subtraction with multiplication, which is a very common error.

My revised thought process for predictions:
*   **A) +4 (Correct):** Shows understanding of multiplying negative numbers.
*   **B) -4:** The "negative * negative = negative" error. Very common.
*   **C) +5:** Error where they add 1 and 4, possibly ignoring signs completely or assuming 'addition' of numbers.
*   **D) -5:** The "adding terms instead of multiplying" error: -1 + (-4). Very common.

**Ability Levels Breakdown:**

*   **Below Basic:** Often struggle with integer operations, especially multiplication of negatives. Easily confuse operations.
*   **Basic:** Understands basic multiplication, but the rules for multiplying negative numbers are still shaky. May fall for common pitfalls.
*   **Proficient:** Generally confident with integer multiplication. Will likely get this correct, but a careless error could occur.
*   **Advanced:** Should be confident and accurate with this fundamental concept.

**Predicting Percentages:**

**below_basic:**
*   Most likely to confuse addition/subtraction with multiplication, so D will be popular.
*   Failing that, the 'negative * negative = negative' rule (B) or ignoring signs altogether (C).
*   Correct answer (A) is a low probability.
*   A: 10%
*   B: 30% (Negative times negative is negative is a strong draw)
*   C: 25% (Adding absolute values)
*   D: 35% (Confusing operations, -1 + -4)

**basic:**
*   Confusion between operations (D) still a significant issue.
*   The "negative * negative = negative" error (B) is a huge trap here.
*   Some will get it right.
*   A: 35%
*   B: 40% (This specific sign error is very common)
*   C: 5% (Less likely to add numbers without signs here)
*   D: 20% (Confusing operations)

**proficient:**
*   Majority will get this correct.
*   The primary error would be a momentary lapse of concentration on the signs (B).
*   Confusing operations (D) should be rare, as should C.
*   A: 75%
*   B: 20% (Careless error or momentary confusion of rules)
*   C: 0% (Extremely unlikely)
*   D: 5% (Possible, if very careless, or if the question text "multiplies the two
