Here's a breakdown of student responses based on ability levels, with explanations for the choices:

**Thought Process:**

*   **Correct Answer:** Substitute y=0.5 into the equation:
    10x - 6(0.5) = 30
    10x - 3 = 30
    10x = 33
    x = 3.3 (Option C)

*   **Error A (4.25):** This would likely come from miscalculating -6 * 0.5 (perhaps seeing it as 6 - 0.5 = 5.5, or even 6 / 0.5 = 12 then 30+12 = 42, 42/10 = 4.2), or incorrectly transposing/dividing later. Or even worse, treating the negative in -6y as a minus sign and then just calculating 6y as 3.
    *   10x - 6(0.5) = 30
    *   10x - 3 = 30 (This is correct to this step)
    *   10x = 30 - 3 (Instead of 30 + 3) --> 10x = 27 --> x = 2.7 (Option D, close)
    *   Alternatively: 10x - 6(0.5) = 30 --> 10x + 3 = 30 (Error: -6y becomes +3). 10x = 27. x = 2.7 (Option D again)
    *   What about 4.25? Could it be a misunderstanding of how the equation works, perhaps trying to rearrange for 'x' before substituting, leading to algebraic errors?
        x = (30 + 6y)/10. If they did 30 + 6(0.5) = 30 + 3 = 33. Then 33/10 = 3.3.
        What if they miscalculated 6y? 6 * 0.5 = 3.
        What if they *divided* instead of multiplied 6 by 0.5? 6 / 0.5 = 12. So 10x - 12 = 30 --> 10x = 42 --> x = 4.2. *Then* they round, or drop the zero. If 4.2 is a possible value they derived, then 4.25 isn't too far. This error chain feels like a stretch for 4.25 directly.
        Let's consider another: 10x - 6y = 30. Substitute 0.5 for y.
        10x - 6 * 0.5 = 30
        10x - 3 = 30
        10x = 33
        x = 3.3
        Option A (4.25): This implies a significantly different result.
        What if they did 10x = 30 - 6(0.5) instead of 30 + 6(0.5)? That would be 10x = 30 - 3 = 27, so x = 2.7 (Option D).
        What if they mistakenly added 6y: 10x + 6y = 30?
        10x + 6(0.5) = 30 --> 10x + 3 = 30 --> 10x = 27 --> x = 2.7 (Option D).
        The *most common* error to get something close to A or D seems to be a sign error or miscalculating 6y or incorrect order of operations.

        Re-examining 4.25:
        If a student had done (30 - 6y) / 10 instead of (30 + 6y)/10, then:
        x = (30 - 6(0.5)) / 10 = (30 - 3) / 10 = 27 / 10 = 2.7 (Option D).
        If a student *mistakenly wrote the original equation* as 10x + 6y = 30, and then correctly rearranged:
        10x = 30 - 6y --> x = (30 - 6(0.5))/10 = 27/10 = 2.7 (Option D).
