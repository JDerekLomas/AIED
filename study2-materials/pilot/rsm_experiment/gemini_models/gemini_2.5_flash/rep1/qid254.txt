Let's break down each option and the common misconceptions:

*   **Correct Answer (not explicitly an option):** The mean would be \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \).
*   **A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \)**
    *   **Error:** Students often forget that 0 is a number that counts towards the *total count* of numbers, even though it doesn't add to the sum. They exclude the zero from the sum but keep it in the count for the divisor. This is a very common and "attractive" error because "zero doesn't add anything" feels intuitively right to many.
*   **B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \)**
    *   **Error:** Order of operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS). Many students, especially those weaker with algebra notation or fraction lines, will see this as a linear calculation and apply division *only* to the 7. They don't understand that the fraction bar implies that the *entire sum* is divided by 5. This is a very common algebraic literacy issue.
*   **C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \)**
    *   **Error:** This is similar to A, but even worse. Students are not including 0 in the sum *and* not including it in the count of numbers. This typically comes from a very strong but incorrect intuition that 0 is not a 'real' number to be considered for mean calculations. This is a common misconception that needs to be ironed out.
*   **D) None of them**
    *   This is the correct answer because none of A, B, or C correctly represent the calculation for the mean of the given numbers.

Now for the predictions based on student ability:

below_basic: A=35% B=45% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=20% B=5% C=0% D=75%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
