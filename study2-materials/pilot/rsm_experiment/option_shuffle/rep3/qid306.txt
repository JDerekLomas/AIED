To predict these percentages, I have looked at two specific common misconceptions:
1.  **BIDMAS Rigidity:** Many students believe "Addition comes before Subtraction" because A comes before S in the acronym. This leads them to prioritise $5+6$ in Problem P, which is a very "attractive" error because $11$ is easier to work with than $-1$.
2.  **Left-to-Right Bias:** "Below Basic" students often ignore order of operations entirely and simply work from left to right, leading them to pick $4+5$ in Problem Q.

Here are the predicted percentages based on a typical Year 9 UK cohort:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=45% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=65% B=30% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0% D=1%
