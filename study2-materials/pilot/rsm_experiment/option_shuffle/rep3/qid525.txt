To predict these percentages, I have evaluated the common misconceptions for Year 9 students:
*   **The Trap (B):** This is the classic "add the numerators, add the denominators" error ($7+1=8, 10+4=14$). This feels very "natural" to struggling students.
*   **The Format Error (C):** Students correctly calculate the common denominator and the sum ($4 \frac{19}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$), but fail to follow the instruction "leave your answer as a mixed number."
*   **The Denominator Error (D):** Students often multiply the denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but fail to adjust the numerators correctly or simplify at the end.
*   **The Correct Method (A):** Finding the LCM of 20, converting fractions to $14/20$ and $5/20$, adding to get $19/20$ and adding the whole numbers.

**below_basic:** Students at this level almost always fall for the visual simplicity of adding across.
**basic:** Many understand they need a common denominator but often forget to convert back to a mixed number or make a basic arithmetic slip.
**proficient:** Most will get the correct value; the main "distractor" here is option C if they don't read the final instruction.
**advanced:** Should navigate the calculation and the instruction perfectly, with only rare "silly" errors.

below_basic: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
