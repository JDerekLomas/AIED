This question is a classic "calculator logic" and "zero-handling" trap. 

**Option A** is the most common mistake for students who rely on scientific calculators but forget BIDMAS/BODMAS; they type it as a single string and don’t realise the calculator will only divide the 7 by 5.
**Option C** is the correct numerical expression, but it attracts students who think the "0" doesn't need to be written in the sum (even though it's counted in the denominator). 
**Option D** is for those who fundamentally misunderstand the mean, believing you only divide by "numbers that have value," excluding the zero from the count.

Here are the predicted percentages based on 200 Year 9 mock papers:

below_basic: A=45% B=5% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=30% D=30%
proficient: A=20% B=5% C=65% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
