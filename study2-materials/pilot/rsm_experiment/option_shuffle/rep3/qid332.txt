To predict these results, I've looked at common misconceptions regarding the order of operations when solving linear equations. 

**Tom** is correct because adding 5 to both sides is a valid first step. 
**Katie** is incorrect because if she multiplies by 3, she must multiply the entire left-hand side (including the -5), resulting in $x-15=36$, not $x-5=36$. This "selective multiplication" is the most common error in GCSE algebra.

**Diagnostic thinking:**
*   **The Trap:** Katie's logic is "attractive" because many students view $\frac{x}{3}$ and $-5$ as separate entities and think they can "get rid of the fraction" first without affecting the rest of the equation.
*   **Below Basic:** Students often guess "Both" because both numbers in the working ($17$ and $36$) appear to come from the numbers in the question ($12+5$ and $12\times3$), making both look plausible.
*   **Proficient:** These students know how to solve the equation themselves (usually by adding 5 first), so they recognise Tom is right. However, many still fall for Katie’s logic because it "looks" like a standard step.
*   **Advanced:** Only the top students consistently spot that Katie failed to multiply the constant term.
