To predict these percentages, I’ve drawn on the common misconceptions seen in Year 9 classrooms regarding the "FOIL" or "grid" method for expanding brackets.

**Calculation Errors & Traps:**
*   **The Addition Trap (Option B and D):** This is the most "attractive" error. Students see a $-1$ and a $-4$ and intuitively sum them to get $-5$, rather than multiplying them.
*   **The Sign Error (Option A):** Students correctly identify that $1 \times 4 = 4$, but fail to apply the rule that a negative times a negative equals a positive. They simply "keep" the negative sign because the numbers involved are negative.
*   **Advanced Logic:** Higher-ability students are often specifically drilled on the "last" term being a "negative times a negative," which makes Option C a high-success area for them.
