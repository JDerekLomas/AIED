To predict these percentages, I’ve looked at the specific misconceptions surrounding inverse operations in Year 9. 

**Step 1 is correct** ($15 \times 4 = 60$).
**Step 2 is incorrect.** Isaac should have subtracted 1 ($60 - 1 = 59$) but instead added 1 ($60 + 1 = 61$).

*   **Below Basic** students often struggle to identify where an error occurred if the numbers "look" right. Many will see the +1 and the 61 and assume addition was the correct move, or simply guess.
*   **Basic** students usually recognise that $15 \times 4 = 60$ is correct, but they often make the "opposite of the opposite" error—seeing a +1 and instinctively adding it to the other side rather than subtracting. This makes Option D a very high-traffic trap.
*   **Proficient** students can usually identify that Step 2 is a mistake, but a small portion may doubt Step 1 (thinking they should have dealt with the +1 before the division).
*   **Advanced** students will solve the equation mentally in seconds, see that $k$ should be 59, and immediately spot that only Step 1 is valid.
