In Year 9, the negative numbers within double brackets act as a significant "filter." Students must navigate two separate conceptual hurdles: correctly summing -5 and -7 for the middle term, and correctly multiplying -5 by -7 for the final constant.

**Thinking behind the distribution:**
*   **A (Correct):** Students need to handle the $-5 \times -7 = +35$ rule. This is the most common place for even mid-ability students to slip up.
*   **B (Attractive Distractor):** This is the classic "I added them to get -12, but forgot that a minus times a minus is a plus." This feels instinctively right to a student who focuses heavily on the addition part of FOIL/Grid method.
*   **C (The Calculation Error):** Students choose this if they find the *difference* between 5 and 7 instead of the sum. This usually indicates a poor grasp of number lines or simply "guessing" the middle term based on the digits provided.
*   **D (The Sign Muddle):** Common among lower-ability students who see two minus signs and decide the whole expression should become positive, or those who confuse the rules for addition and multiplication of directed numbers.
