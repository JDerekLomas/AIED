After marking hundreds of these, I can tell you that "changing the subject" of a formula involving fractions and powers is a significant hurdle for Year 9s. Most students recall (or are given) $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, but the algebraic manipulation of moving the $\frac{4}{3}$ is where the split occurs.

Here is the breakdown of how the 200 papers likely look:

**Error Analysis:**
*   **D (Correct):** Multiplied by 3, divided by $4\pi$, then cube rooted.
*   **A (The "Upside Down" Trap):** The most common error. Students see $\frac{4}{3}$ and instinctively think the 4 stays on top because it’s "on top" in the original formula.
*   **C (Multiplication Error):** Students who think everything next to the $r$ must be multiplied together on the other side.
*   **B (Algebraic Confusion):** Often a guess or a total misinterpretation of how to treat the coefficient and the exponent.
