Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses based on common Year 9 misconceptions in fractions:

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option C (Correct):** Adding whole numbers (2+1=3) and numerators (1+2=3). 
*   **Option B (Common Trap):** Adding whole numbers correctly but adding the denominators together (5+5=10). This is a very common intuitive error for middle-to-lower ability students.
*   **Option A (Instructional Error):** Converting to an improper fraction $(11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5)$. Many students default to "improper" because it's what they've practiced most recently, despite the question requesting a mixed number.
*   **Option D (Double Error):** Converting/adding incorrectly and adding the denominators.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=5% C=74% D=1%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=95% D=0%
