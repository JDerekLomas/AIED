In marking this specific Year 9 mock question, I have observed the following trends:

**A** is the "visual symmetry" trap. Students see the \(+4\) and feel it needs to be "balanced" or simply guess because it looks more complex.
**B** is the "directionality" error. Many lower-ability students intuitively place the larger or more complex expression on top, or simply confuse dividend and divisor order.
**D** is the "missing brackets" trap. Students who don't fully respect the grouping of the denominator often assume the division only applies to the first term, especially if they have been practicing "clearing" fractions recently.

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 papers:

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=25% C=40% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=75% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=95% D=3%
