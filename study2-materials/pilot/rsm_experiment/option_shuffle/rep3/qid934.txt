To predict the performance for this question, we must look at the specific misconceptions Year 9 students face when dealing with implicit linear equations (where $y$ is not the subject).

**The Wrong Answers & The Logic:**
*   **A) 3:** This is the most common procedural error. A student substitutes $x=0$, gets $4(0) + 2y = 10$, but then mistakenly calculates $4+2y=10$, leading to $2y=6$ and $y=3$. They treat $4x$ as $4+x$.
*   **B) 2.5:** This comes from the "Linear/Gradient" misconception. A student knows that $10/4 = 2.5$ or confuses the relationship by assuming $y$ is simply a result of $10 \div 4$ because $x$ is 0.
*   **C) 20:** The "Multiplication" error. The student sees $4x+2y=10$, puts $x=0$, but then ignores the $2y$ and assumes they need to do $10 \times 2$. Or, they misread the operation entirely.
*   **D) 5 (Correct):** The student substitutes $x=0$, simplifies $0 + 2y = 10$, and divides $10$ by $2$.

**The Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often struggle with substitution. They are likely to pick **A** (addition error) or **C** (random operation).
*   **Basic:** Can substitute $x=0$ but often struggle with the two-step equation remaining ($2y=10$). Many will choose **A** because "4 becomes 0" feels like a subtraction, leaving 6, divided by 2 is 3.
*   **Proficient:** Generally understand substitution. Some might make a "rushing" error by assuming $y = 10 - 4$, but most will see that $2y=10$.
*   **Advanced:** Will see $x=0$ and immediately divide 10 by 2. Almost no errors here unless it's a bubble-sheet slip.
