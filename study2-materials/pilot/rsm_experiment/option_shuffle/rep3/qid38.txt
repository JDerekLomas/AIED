To solve this problem, a student must find a common denominator (likely $2x$) by multiplying the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$. This yields $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

**Teacher's Analysis of Common Errors:**
*   **A ($7/3x$):** The most common lower-ability error. Students add the numerators ($3+4$) and add the denominators ($2x+x$). It feels intuitive to students who treat fractions like vectors.
*   **B ($7/2x$):** Students recognize $2x$ as the common denominator but forget to adjust the second numerator, simply adding $3+4$ while keeping $2x$.
*   **C ($11/2x$):** The correct answer.
*   **D ($11/x$):** Students successfully find the numerator 11 but somehow decide the "simplified" denominator should be $x$, or they cancel a 2 incorrectly.
