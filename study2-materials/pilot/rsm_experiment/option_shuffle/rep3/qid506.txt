Having marked 200 of these, I can tell you that this question is a classic "procedural vs. conceptual" trap. 

**Option D ($p=4$)** is the strongest distractor for the bottom half of the cohort. Students see a 3 and a 12 and immediately multiply or perform a "common sense" division ($12 \div 3$) because they aren't comfortable with the fraction on the RHS. 
**Option C ($p=\frac{1}{4}$)** is for those who try to "divide by 3" but do it to the denominator instead of the whole fraction, effectively thinking $12 \div 3 = 4$.
**Option B ($p=\frac{1}{9}$)** is a rarer calculation error, often from students subtracting 3 from 12 or confusing the operation with squares.
**Option A ($p=\frac{1}{36}$)** is the correct answer ($\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{36}$), which requires a solid understanding of dividing fractions.
