In this Year 9 mock, this question assesses knowledge of BIDMAS/order of operations. The most common pitfall is the tendency for weaker students to calculate from left to right, ignoring the priority of division over addition.

**Error Analysis:**
*   **LHS (Left Hand Side):** The correct answer is $8 + 3 = 11$. The common error is $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 5$.
*   **RHS (Right Hand Side):** The calculation is $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 5$.
*   **Option D ($=$):** Very attractive to students who calculate the LHS as $20 \div 4$. They see the same numbers and operators and assume the brackets don't change the value because they perform the addition first regardless.
*   **Option A ($<$):** Only chosen by those who guess or potentially miscalculate $20 \div 4$ as something smaller than $11$.
*   **Option C ($>$):** The correct answer ($11 > 5$). Students must correctly apply BIDMAS to the LHS to reach this.
