To predict these outcomes, I have considered the following common Year 9 student behaviours for this specific linear equation problem ($10x - 6y = 30$ where $y = 0.5$):

*   **The Trap (Option D):** Many students struggle with the order of operations when substituting. They mistakenly think they should subtract $6$ from $30$ first, or they confuse the $x$ and $y$ variables. $3.3$ comes from $10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 33 \rightarrow x = 3.3$. This is the "clean" answer that feels correct because it yields a terminating decimal without much friction.
*   **The Sign Error (Option B):** Students often add instead of subtract (or vice versa) when moving terms across the equals sign. $10x - 3 = 30$ becomes $10x = 27 \rightarrow x = 2.7$. 
*   **The Substitution Swaps (Option A & C):** Lower ability students often put the $0.5$ in the $x$ column by mistake ($10(0.5) - 6y = 30$), leading to $5 - 6y = 30$, which eventually leads to calculations involving $25 \div 6$ or similar negative results.
*   **The Proficient Check:** Stronger students will correctly navigate $10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$. 

*Wait, let's re-calculate: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$.*

Actually, in this specific question, **D (3.3)** is the correct answer. The distractors work as follows:
- **B (2.7):** Student calculates $10x + 3 = 30$ (sign error).
- **C (4.25):** Student swaps $x$ and $y$, $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \rightarrow 5 - 30 = 6y \rightarrow -25/6$, or they make a mess of the division $33/6$.
- **A (-4.25):** Swap and sign error.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=15% C=5% D=75%
advanced: A=1% B=4% C=0% D=95%
