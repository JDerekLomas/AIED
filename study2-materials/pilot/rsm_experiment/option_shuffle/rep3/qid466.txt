To arrive at these predictions, I have considered the following common pitfalls for Year 9 students:

*   **The Sign Trap:** Students often focus so hard on the reciprocal (flipping the fraction) that they lose track of the signs. Many see the negative on the left and a negative result and conclude they need another negative to "keep it negative," failing to realise that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive.
*   **The Identity Trap:** Lower-ability students often confuse the rules for multiplying to get $1$ (reciprocal) with the rules for adding to get $0$ (additive inverse), leading them to pick B or D.
*   **The "Makes sense" error:** Option A is the most "attractive" wrong answer because it looks like a complete set of "negative three-quarters" and its "flipped" version.

Here is the predicted breakdown of 200 Year 9 mock papers:

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=25% B=5% C=65% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=95% D=0%
