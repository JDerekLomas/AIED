In marking 200 of these Year 9 scripts, this question effectively tests two distinct things: BIDMAS/order of operations (Squaring vs Multiplying) and decimal place value.

The most common trap is **Option D**, which comes from doing $(3 \times 0.3)^2$. Students incorrectly multiply the coefficient before squaring the base. **Option B** is the most common decimal placement error ($0.3^2 = 0.9$ followed by $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$), usually made by students who rely on "moving the decimal point" rules they don't quite understand. **Option C** represents a "double error" (squaring everything including the 3).

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=55% B=25% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=92% B=5% C=1% D=2%
