To predict these results, I have considered the following common misconceptions seen in Year 9:
*   **The "Multiplying" Error (A):** The most common mistake. Students see a 10 and a 5 and immediately multiply them ($10 \times 5 = 50$) because they remember that solving equations involves "the opposite," and they associate division with multiplication without checking the position of the variable.
*   **The "Dividing Top-Down" Error (D):** Students recognize they need to divide but naturally divide the larger number by the smaller one ($10 \div 5 = 2$). This is a very "attractive" wrong answer for mid-ability students who have a rough idea of the process but lack algebraic fluency.
*   **The Conceptual Confusion (B):** Usually chosen by students who see a smaller number being divided to result in a larger number and believe it is mathematically impossible.
*   **The Correct Inversion (C):** Requires the student to realize $10p = 5$, therefore $p = 5/10$. 

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=65% B=15% C=5% D=15%
basic: A=40% B=5% C=20% D=35%
proficient: A=15% B=0% C=65% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=0% C=95% D=3%
