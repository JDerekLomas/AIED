In Year 9, "BIDMAS" or "BODMAS" is a double-edged sword. While students are confident that multiplication comes before addition (Problem Q), the acronym itself leads to a systematic error in Problem P. Because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym, many students (even higher-ability ones) wrongly believe Addition must be performed before Subtraction, regardless of the left-to-right rule.

**Specific Errors:**
*   **The BIDMAS Trap (Option A/B):** Students see $+6$ and $-5$ and believe they must add first because of the mnemonic, incorrectly thinking the problem is $4 - (5+6)$.
*   **The Left-to-Right Default (Option D):** Usually found in lower-ability students who have forgotten or never grasped priority of operations and treat math like reading a sentence.
*   **The Correct Path (Option C):** Recognising that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority (working left-to-right) and Multiplication takes precedence over Addition.

**Distribution Prediction:**
