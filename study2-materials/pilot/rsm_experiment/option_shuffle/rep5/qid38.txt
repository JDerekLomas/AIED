To solve $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator (likely $2x$). This requires multiplying the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$, resulting in $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

**Teacher's Marking Analysis:**
*   **Option A ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** The most common error. Students simply add the numerators ($3+4$) but keep the denominator they recognize as the "larger" or more complex one. This feels "right" to students who don't understand the multiplicative nature of equivalent fractions.
*   **Option B ($\frac{11}{x}$):** Students correctly find that $4/x = 8/2x$ and add $3+8=11$, but they then "simplify" the $2x$ back down to $x$, or incorrectly treat $2x$ and $x$ as if they could just add the numerators and keep the "base" variable.
*   **Option C ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** The classic "add across" error. $3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$. This is very common at the "Below Basic" level.
*   **Option D ($\frac{11}{2x}$):** The correct answer.
