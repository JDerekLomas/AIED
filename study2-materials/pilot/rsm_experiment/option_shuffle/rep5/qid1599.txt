In marking this question across 200 papers, the primary hurdle for students isn't just knowing that division is represented as a fraction, but understanding that the term following the $\div$ symbol acts as the denominator. 

**Error Analysis:**
*   **Option A:** This is the most common error. Many students (particularly at 'below basic' and 'basic' levels) believe that the expression with more terms $(h+4)$ "looks" like it should be the base or numerator of the fraction, or they simply read the operation in reverse order.
*   **Option B:** This represents a BIDMAS/Order of Operations error. Students recognise that division is a fraction but only apply it to the $h$, effectively treating the $(h+4)$ as if the brackets weren't there.
*   **Option C:** This is a "matching" error where students feel the $4$ needs to be balanced on both the top and bottom of the fraction to "look" algebraic.

**Predictive breakdown:**

below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=5% D=45%
proficient: A=12% B=8% C=0% D=80%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=0% D=97%
