To solve $10x - 6y = 30$ when $y = 0.5$:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$ (**B**)

**Calculation Errors and Traps:**
*   **Answer A (2.7):** Students correctly calculate $6 \times 0.5 = 3$ but subtract it from 30 ($10x = 27$) instead of adding it. This is a very common "sign change" error in Year 9.
*   **Answer B (3.3):** The correct answer.
*   **Answer C (-4.25):** Students confuse $x$ and $y$. They substitute $x=0.5$ into the equation ($5 - 6y = 30$), leading to $-6y = 25$, then divide 25 by 6 incorrectly or roughly estimate, ending up with a negative value.
*   **Answer D (4.25):** Similar to C, students substitute $0.5$ for $x$ and then struggle with the negative $6y$ or simply divide the sum ($30+10+6+0.5$ logic) randomly. 4.25 is also a common "guess" for students who try to find a midpoint or see "30 and 6" and think in terms of quarters.
