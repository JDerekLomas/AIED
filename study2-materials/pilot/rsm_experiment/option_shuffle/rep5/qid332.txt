To determine the distribution, I have considered the common misconceptions associated with two-step equations in Year 9.

**Tom's logic:** He uses the "standard" method (inverse of -5). This is the most common path taught. Most students recognize this as correct.
**Katie's logic:** She attempts to multiply by 3 first but fails to distribute the 3 to the constant term (the -5). This is an incredibly common "trap" for students who don't fully grasp the priority of operations or the "balance both sides" rule.
**The "Trap":** Only students who have been taught specifically about equivalent operations (multiplying *every* term by the denominator) will spot that Katie is incorrect. Most "basic" and "proficient" students will see $12 \times 3 = 36$ and assume she is correct without checking the $-5$.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=40% C=5% D=50%
advanced: A=2% B=8% C=0% D=90%
