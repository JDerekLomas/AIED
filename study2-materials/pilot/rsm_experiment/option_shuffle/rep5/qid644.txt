In this Year 9 mock, students frequently confuse the rules for "expanding" (multiplying) with the rules for "simplifying" (adding/subtracting). This is the classic trap for this specific question.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option A (-5):** The most common mistake. Students see the -1 and -4 and mentally combine them as a sum $(-1 - 4 = -5)$ rather than a product.
*   **Option B (+5):** Same addition error as A, but the student remembers "two minuses make a plus" and applies it incorrectly to the sum.
*   **Option C (-4):** Usually a result of a student forgetting the sign of the first term $(-1 \times -4)$ and just carrying down the $-4$, or simply a lapse in focus.
*   **Option D (+4):** The correct answer $(-1 \times -4 = 4)$.

**Predicted Distributions:**

**Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the definition of "multiply" in an algebraic context, frequently defaulting to addition because the numbers are small.
below_basic: A=55% B=15% C=10% D=20%

**Basic:** These students know they should multiply, but negative number arithmetic is their Achilles' heel. They are highly susceptible to the "lump the numbers together" mistake (Option A).
basic: A=40% B=10% C=5% D=45%

**Proficient:** These students generally remember to multiply rather than add, but a significant minority will make a "sign error" (calculating $1 \times 4$ but forgetting the $- \times - = +$ rule).
proficient: A=15% B=2% C=3% D=80%

**Advanced:** These students will identify the operation correctly and apply the negative multiplication rules fluently. Any errors here are usually due to extreme rushing.
advanced: A=2% B=0% C=1% D=97%
