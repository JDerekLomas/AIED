To solve \(-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1\), the student must find the reciprocal of \(-\frac{3}{4}\). The correct answer is **D** (\(\frac{4}{3}\)), because \(-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -\frac{12}{12} = -1\).

**Common Misconceptions & Errors:**
*   **The Negative Trap:** Students often struggle with the rule that `negative × positive = negative`. Many see two negatives in the equation and instinctively choose another negative to "match" the style of the first term (Option C).
*   **Reciprocal Confusion:** Weaker students forget the property that a number times its reciprocal equals 1. They often confuse multiplication rules with addition rules, looking for a number that "complements" the fraction visually (Options A and B).
*   **Option C (The "Partial Knowledge" Trap):** This is the most common error for middle-ability students. They know they need to "flip" the fraction (reciprocal), but they incorrectly assume they must keep the negative sign because the original term was negative.

**Predicted Distributions:**

**below_basic:** A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
*Context: These students often guess or try to "cancel out" the numbers visually without calculating. They gravitate towards the exact same number (A) or the positive version (B) through basic intuition.*

**basic:** A=15% B=15% C=50% D=20%
*Context: Most students here recognize the fraction needs to change, but the negative sign is a major distractor. C is highly attractive as it "looks" like the mathematical inverse even though it creates a positive 1 rather than negative 1.*

**proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=30% D=60%
*Context: Most should identify the reciprocal (D), but a significant portion will still rush and fall into the "double negative" trap, picking C.*

**advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
*Context: Top-end Year 9 students will mentally check the calculation (\(-\frac{12}{12}\)) and spot the sign error immediately if they were tempted by C.*
