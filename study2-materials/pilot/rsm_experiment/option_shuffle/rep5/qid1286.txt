To predict these percentages, I’ve considered the following common pitfalls:
*   **The "Visual Pattern" Trap:** Many students recall the $4/3$ and $\pi$ but fail to use formal algebraic manipulation. They look for the numbers in the positions they "usually" see them (Option C), forgetting that multiplying by $3/4$ is the inverse operation.
*   **Fraction Flipping:** Students often struggle with moving a fraction across an equals sign. Multiplying by 3 is intuitive, but many then think they must divide the *whole thing* by $4/3$ without simplifying the reciprocal, or they simply move the $4$ and $3$ to where they "look right."
*   **Order of Operations:** Below-basic students often forget that the cube root applies to the entire expression, sometimes selecting A because they've tried to isolate $r$ bit-by-bit but gotten lost in the notation.

Here is the predicted breakdown for a Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=35% D=15%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=3% D=0%
