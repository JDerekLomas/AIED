After marking 200 of these, the "Table of Values" question remains a classic litmus test for algebraic manipulation.

The most common trap here is **Option A (2.5)**. Students often correctly substitute $x=0$ to get $2y=10$, but then mistakenly calculate $10 \div 4$ instead of $10 \div 2$, distracted by the coefficient of $x$. **Option C (3)** is the "misreading the equation" error; students look at $4x+2y$ and assume the pattern involves adding or subtracting the coefficients ($4-2=2$; $10-4-3$ etc.) or they simply guess a number that "looks" right in a sequence. **Option D (20)** comes from those who substitute $x=0$ but then somehow multiply 10 by 2 instead of dividing.

Here is the breakdown by ability level:

**below_basic:** Students at this level struggle with the concept of substitution and the equals sign. Many see the '4' and the '10' and perform $10 \div 4$ to get 2.5, or simply guess a mid-range integer like 3.
**basic:** These students know they need to "do something" with the 0. Most successfully eliminate the $4x$ term, but then 50% of them will still divide by the wrong coefficient or perform an incorrect operation.
**proficient:** These students almost all know that $4(0) = 0$. The majority will get to $2y=10$ and solve for $y=5$. The remaining errors here are usually "silly mistakes" under pressure (selecting A).
**advanced:** At this level, $y$-intercepts are second nature. They see $x=0$ and immediately solve the one-step equation $2y=10$.

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=45% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=15% B=80% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=98% C=0% D=0%
