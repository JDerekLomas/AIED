To provide these predictions, I have considered the common pitfalls for Year 9 students:
1.  **Additive/Multiplicative Confusion:** Lower-ability students often multiply the base by the index ($3 \times 4 = 12$).
2.  **The Negative Base Trap:** This is the most "attractive" error. Many students (even proficient ones) perform $(-3)^4$ on a calculator or mentally as $-(3^4)$, failing to recognise that an even power of a negative number yields a positive result.
3.  **Order of Operations:** Advanced students almost always correctly identify that $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81$.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=35% C=5% D=55%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
