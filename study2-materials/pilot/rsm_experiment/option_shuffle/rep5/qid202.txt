Having marked hundreds of these scripts, this question specifically tests two things: the ability to handle mixed numbers without converting (or correctly converting if they choose to) and the "golden rule" of denominators. 

**Diagnostic Analysis:**
*   **A ($3 \frac{3}{10}$):** The classic "Add everything" error. Students add the whole numbers ($2+1=3$) and the numerators ($1+2=3$), but also add the denominators ($5+5=10$). This is highly attractive to lower-attaining students who lack a conceptual understanding of what the denominator represents.
*   **B ($\frac{18}{10}$):** This usually stems from a student trying to convert to improper fractions but multiplying incorrectly ($2 \times 5 + 1$ becoming $6 \times 1$) or simply guessing based on adding the denominators.
*   **C ($\frac{18}{5}$):** The correct mathematical value, but incorrect format. These students have likely converted to improper fractions ($\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}$) but failed to read the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
*   **D ($3 \frac{3}{5}$):** The correct answer.
