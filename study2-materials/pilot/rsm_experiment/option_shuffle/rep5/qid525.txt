To arrive at these predictions, I have considered the following common student behaviours:

*   **Option A (The "Across" Method):** This is the classic trap for **below_basic** students. They add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$) and then simply add the numerators and denominators ($7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$). It feels "natural" because it mirrors multiplication rules.
*   **Option B (The Decimal/Conversion Trap):** Students often convert to improper fractions but fail to find a common denominator, or they multiply $10 \times 4$ for the denominator but forget to adjust the numerators correctly, resulting in a "messy" fraction that feels right because it's improper.
*   **Option C (Correct):** Finding the common denominator of 20. $2 \frac{14}{20} + 2 \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$.
*   **Option D (The Format Trap):** This is the correct numerical value expressed as an improper fraction ($\frac{99}{20}$). **Proficient** students often do the hard work correctly but fail to read the final instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."

Here are the predicted percentages based on a typical Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=35% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=70% D=20%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=95% D=3%
