This question is a classic "mean with zero" trap, which consistently trips up students across all tiers in Year 9 mock exams.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option B (The "Ignore Zero" Trap):** This is the most common conceptual error. Students remember the rule "sum of numbers divided by how many numbers there are," but instinctively believe that zero doesn't "count" as a piece of data. This feels natural to struggling students because adding zero doesn't change the sum.
*   **Option C (The Calculator Order of Operations Trap):** This mimics exactly what a student would see on a non-fractional scientific calculator. They type the string and the calculator performs $7 \div 5$ first. Proficient students often fall for this if they are thinking about the "process" rather than the mathematical notation.
*   **Option D (The Correct Answer):** Requires the student to recognize that 0 is a data point that must be accounted for in the divisor, even though it contributes nothing to the numerator.
*   **Option A:** Often chosen by students who see that 0 isn't in the numerator of B and D and get confused, or think the sum must be explicitly shown as $0+1+3+4+7$.

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 Year 9 mock papers:

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=50% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=25% C=20% D=50%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=5% D=90%
