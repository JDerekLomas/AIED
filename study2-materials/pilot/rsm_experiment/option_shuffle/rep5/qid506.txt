Having marked 200 of these, I can tell you that this question is a classic "fraction trap." Students see a 3 and a 12 and their brains immediately start shouting "4" or "9" before they've even picked up a pen.

Here is the breakdown of the errors I see:
*   **Option B ($p=4$)** is the most common error for lower-ability students. They see $3$ and $12$ and perform $12 \div 3$, completely ignoring the fact that the $12$ is a denominator.
*   **Option D ($p=\frac{1}{4}$)** is the "pseudo-maths" error. Students know they need to divide by 3, and they know $12 \div 3 = 4$, so they keep it as a fraction but put the 4 on the bottom. It feels "right" because it looks tidy.
*   **Option A ($p=\frac{1}{9}$)** occurs when students think they need to subtract 3 from 12 (misidentifying the operation) or make a basic arithmetic slip while trying to manipulate the fraction.
*   **Option C ($\frac{1}{36}$)** is the correct answer, requiring the student to realize that dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying the denominator by 3 (or multiplying by $\frac{1}{3}$).
