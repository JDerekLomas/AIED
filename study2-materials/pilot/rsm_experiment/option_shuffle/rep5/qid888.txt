To predict these percentages, I’ve drawn on the common "sign trap" issues seen in Year 9 algebra. 

**Thinking Process:**
*   **The Positive/Negative Trap:** The most frequent error is $-5 \times -7$. Many students correctly sum them to $-12m$ but instinctively put a minus sign at the end because the numbers in the brackets are negative. This makes **A** a very strong distractor for "Basic" and "Proficient" students.
*   **The Sum/Difference Trap:** Some students get confused between adding and finding the difference ($7 - 5 = 2$), leading them to **D**.
*   **The Over-Correction:** "Basic" students often remember "two minuses make a plus" but apply it to the addition as well, leading to $+12m$, which is option **B**.
*   **Proficiency Level:** "Proficient" students know the FOIL/Grid method but often make one slip with the final constant term. "Advanced" students have internalised that a negative multiplied by a negative is a positive and will rarely miss the $+35$.

**Predicted Responses:**

below_basic: A=35% B=30% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=5% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=0% C=98% D=0%
