In my experience marking this specific type of algebra question with Year 9s, the error in Step 2 is an incredibly common "reflex" mistake. Students see $60$ and $1$ and their brain performs the operation suggested by the '+' sign ($60 + 1$) rather than the inverse operation required to solve the equation ($60 - 1$).

For **below basic** students, Step 1 often looks "wrong" because they expect to see a division (15 ÷ 4) or don't understand how the denominator moves. Many guess B because they assume the provided "solution" in a question is likely correct.

For **basic** students, Step 1 is recognised as correct, but they are highly susceptible to the trap in Step 2. They see $1 + k = 60$, and their intuition leads them to $k = 61$ without checking. D is the "correct" answer here, but many will choose B because the logic in Step 2 feels natural to them.

**Proficient** students are more likely to perform the inverse operation mentally and realise $61 - 1 \neq 60$, though a significant portion will still skim-read and choose B.

**Advanced** students will check the substitution ($61 + 1 = 62; 62 \div 4 \neq 15$) and quickly identify that only the first manipulation was valid.
