To provide these predictions, I am drawing on the common Year 9 misconception regarding inverse operations and "multiplicative symmetry"—the tendency for students to assume that the larger number is always the numerator/dividend.

**Thinking behind the options:**
*   **A (No solutions):** Often chosen by students who see a small number divided by something equaling a larger number and believe it's "impossible."
*   **B (p=2):** The classic "commutative trap." Students see 10 and 5 and immediately perform $10 \div 5$. This is the most attractive distractor.
*   **C (p=50):** The multiplication error. Students know they need to "do the opposite" to get $p$ on its own, so they multiply $10 \times 5$, ignoring $p$'s position in the denominator.
*   **D (p=0.5):** The correct answer. Requires the multi-step understanding that $10p = 5$, therefore $p = 5/10$.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=5%
basic: A=5% B=60% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=30% C=8% D=60%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
