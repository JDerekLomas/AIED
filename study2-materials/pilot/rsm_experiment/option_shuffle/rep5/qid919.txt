Having marked hundreds of these, this question is a classic trap involving the order of operations (BIDMAS) and decimal place value. 

The most common error is students squaring $3x$ rather than just $x$, leading to $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$ (Option D). Alternatively, weaker students forget that squaring a decimal between 0 and 1 makes it smaller, incorrectly calculating $0.3^2$ as $0.9$ rather than $0.09$. This leads them to $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ (Option A). Option B ($1.8$) usually comes from students who double rather than square ($3 \times (0.3 \times 2) = 1.8$ or $3^2 \times 0.2$).

Here is the breakdown of how Year 9 students typically perform on this task:

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=25% D=25%
proficient: A=20% B=5% C=55% D=20%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=85% D=10%
