To solve this, students must navigate two distinct concepts: reciprocal relationships and the rules of signs.

The calculation errors typically follow these patterns:
- **Option A ($\frac{3}{4}$):** Confusion between multiplicative and additive inverses. Students see $-\frac{3}{4}$ and think the answer is the positive version to reach a result related to "1".
- **Option B ($\frac{4}{3}$):** Recognising that a reciprocal is needed to reach a magnitude of 1, but forgetting the "minus times minus equals plus" rule. This is a very common "half-way" mistake.
- **Option C ($-\frac{3}{4}$):** Common among low-ability students who believe multiplication by a fraction should result in that same fraction or its negative, failing to grasp the concept of "identity" vs "inverse".
- **Option D ($-\frac{4}{3}$):** The correct answer. Students must recognise that they need the reciprocal to turn the fraction into 1, and a second negative sign to turn the negative into a positive result.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=40% D=5%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=30% C=5% D=55%
advanced: A=2% B=8% C=0% D=90%
