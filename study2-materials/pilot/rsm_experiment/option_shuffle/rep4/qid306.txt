In my experience marking these papers, Problem P is a notorious "BIDMAS trap." Many students over-rely on the acronym and assume Addition *must* come before Subtraction, rather than treating them with equal priority from left to right. Problem Q is a standard test of Order of Operations.

**Calculation Errors & Traps:**
*   **The "Addition Priority" Trap (Problem P):** This leads students to A or C. They see the 'A' before the 'S' in BIDMAS and mistakenly believe they must do $5+6$ first, often leading them to an incorrect answer of $4-11=-7$.
*   **The "Read Left-to-Right" Trap (Problem Q):** This leads students to A or B. Students ignore operation hierarchy and simply process the numbers as they appear ($4+5=9$, then $9 \times 6$).
*   **Advanced Students:** They recognize that for P, you work left-to-right (Subtraction and Addition are equal priority), and for Q, Multiplication takes precedence.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
*Critique: These students often apply BIDMAS literally for P (Addition first) and work left-to-right for Q because it’s "easier."*

basic: A=25% B=10% C=45% D=20%
*Critique: These students usually know the rule for Q (Multiplication first) but almost always fall for the Addition-before-Subtraction trap in P.*

proficient: A=10% B=5% C=25% D=60%
*Critique: These students have mastered the order for Q, but roughly a quarter of the "solid" Year 9s still get tripped up by the Subtraction/Addition priority in P.*

advanced: A=2% B=0% C=8% D=90%
*Critique: The majority will get this right, though a small minority may still have the "A before S" rule hard-wired so deeply they overthink Problem P.*
