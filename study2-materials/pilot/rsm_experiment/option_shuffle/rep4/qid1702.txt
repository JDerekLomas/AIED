To solve for $\bigstar$ (the $x$ value), students must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$.

**Common Misconceptions & Errors:**
*   **The Subtract Trap (Option B):** Students calculate $10x = 30 - 3$ (instead of adding 3) to get $10x = 27$, leading to $2.7$. This is highly common among basic/proficient students who confuse inverse operations.
*   **The Calculation Slip (Option C/D):** Students treat $6 \times 0.5$ incorrectly as $12$ or miss the negative sign entirely, leading to variations around $4.2$ or $4.25$ through arithmetic errors or mixing up $x$ and $y$ values. 
*   **Arithmetic Precision:** Lower ability students often guess based on the "look" of the numbers, frequently choosing B or D because they expect $0.5$ to result in a value ending in $.25$ or $.75$.
