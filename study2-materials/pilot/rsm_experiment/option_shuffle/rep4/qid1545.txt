In this Year 9 cohort, the primary "trap" is the instinct to read mathematics left-to-right like a sentence, rather than applying the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

**Calculations behind the options:**
*   **Correct (Left side):** $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$.
*   **Correct (Right side):** $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$.
*   **Since $11 > 5$, the answer is B.**

**The common errors:**
*   **Left-to-right error (Left side):** $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 5$. If a student does this, they get $5 \square 5$, leading them to **Option A**. This is incredibly attractive to "Basic" students who see the same numbers and assume symmetry.
*   **Visual Similarity:** Students often see the same digits and operators and impulsively select **Option A** without calculating at all.
*   **Symbol Confusion:** "Below Basic" students often calculate correctly ($11$ and $5$) but confuse the $<$ and $>$ symbols, leading to **Option D**.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=5% D=35%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=2% D=18%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=0% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=97% C=0% D=1%
