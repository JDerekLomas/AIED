In my experience marking this specific type of question, the "Year 9 Fog" is very real. Students often lose sight of the operation (multiplication) and slip into addition/subtraction, particularly when they see two negative signs together.

Here is the breakdown of how those 200 papers usually look:

**Error Analysis:**
*   **B (Correct):** $(-1) \times (-4) = +4$. 
*   **A (The 'Adder'):** Students see $-1$ and $-4$, and their brain defaults to addition but forgets how negatives work, or they think "two minuses make a plus" applies to $1+4$. 
*   **C (The Number Line Error):** The most common mistake for lower-ability students. They calculate $-1 - 4 = -5$, confusing "expanding" with simply combining the digits they see.
*   **D (The Sign Dropper):** They multiply $1 \times 4$ but assume the negative stays because "the question has minuses in it."

**Predictions:**
