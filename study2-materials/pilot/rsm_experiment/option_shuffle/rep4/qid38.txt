To arrive at these predictions, I have considered the following common pitfalls:
*   **The "Add everything" trap (D):** Students often simply add the numerators ($3+4$) and the denominators ($2x+x$), reflecting a complete misunderstanding of common denominators.
*   **The "Numerator only" error (C):** Students recognise they need a common denominator but choose the "easier" one ($2x$) without adjusting the second fraction's numerator. 
*   **The "Scale the first, not the second" error (A):** A calculation error where students multiply the first numerator by the wrong factor or overcompensate.
*   **Success (B):** Multiplying $\frac{4}{x}$ by $\frac{2}{2}$ to get $\frac{8}{2x}$, then adding $3+8$.
