To solve \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\), a student must divide both sides by 3. This is equivalent to multiplying the denominator by 3, yielding \(p = \frac{1}{36}\).

**Error Analysis:**
*   **A ($p=4$):** This is the "intuition over inverse" error. Students see 3 and 12 and immediately think of the relationship \(12 \div 3\). They ignore the reciprocal nature of the fraction entirely.
*   **B ($p=\frac{1}{4}$):** The most common mistake. Students correctly identify that they need to divide by 3, but apply it only to the denominator as a division ($12 \div 3 = 4$) rather than a multiplication. It "feels" right because the number gets smaller in magnitude.
*   **C ($p=\frac{1}{9}$):** A "distraction" error where students might misread 12 as 3 or square/multiply 3 incorrectly, though less common than the others.
*   **D ($p=\frac{1}{36}$):** The correct application of dividing a fraction by an integer.
