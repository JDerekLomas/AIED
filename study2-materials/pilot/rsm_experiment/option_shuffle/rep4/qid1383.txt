In this Year 9 mock, the most significant "trap" isn't the calculation, but the notation of negative indices. Many students use their calculators and input $-3^4$ without brackets, resulting in -81, while others fall for the classic "linear" trap of multiplying the base by the index.

**Misconception Profile:**
*   **A (-81):** The "Calculated Trap." Students do $(-3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3)$ but incorrectly believe the result stays negative because the base was negative, or they typed it into a Casio calculator as $-3^4$ without brackets. Extremely common.
*   **B (81):** The correct answer. Requires the student to know that an even exponent results in a positive value.
*   **C (-12):** The "Linear Trap." $k \times 4 \Rightarrow -3 \times 4 = -12$. Typical of students struggling with the concept of powers.
*   **D (12):** Similar to C, but the student has "lost" the negative sign during multiplication.

**Predicted Distributions:**
