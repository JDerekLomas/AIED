In my experience marking this specific question, it serves as a classic "trap" for students who rely on intuitive number relationships rather than formal algebraic manipulation.

The "attractive" error here is Option A ($p=2$). Students see the numbers 10 and 5 and their brain jumps to $10 \div 5 = 2$ or $5 \times 2 = 10$ without checking the position of the variable. Option D ($p=50$) is the classic "multiplication instead of division" error, common among students who know they need to "move the $p$" but do so incorrectly.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

**below_basic: A=65% B=5% C=5% D=25%**
*(These students see the numbers 10 and 5 and immediately pick 2 because "it fits." Those who remember a "rule" about multiplying to solve equations often jump to 50.)*

**basic: A=50% B=20% C=0% D=30%**
*(The "A" trap remains very strong here. Some start to realize that $5/2$ isn't 10, but a significant portion still succumb to the mental shortcut $10/5=2$.)*

**proficient: A=15% B=75% C=0% D=10%**
*(These students have been taught to multiply by the denominator first ($10p = 5$), which successfully leads them to $5/10 = 0.5$. However, some still rush and write 2 in the final step.)*

**advanced: A=2% B=97% C=0% D=1%**
*(At this level, students automatically perform the "swap" between the result and the divisor or follow formal steps. Mistakes are rare and usually down to extreme rushing.)*
