To predict these percentages, I’ve considered the following common pitfalls:
*   **The BODMAS Trap (A):** Many students understand that division can be a fraction bar, but they apply it only to the term immediately following the operator ($c \div h$) and treat the $+4$ as a separate entity, failing to see the brackets as a "glue" for the denominator.
*   **The Inverse Error (C):** Students who recognize the structure of a fraction but instinctively put the "heavier" expression (the binomial) on the top, or simply confuse numerator and denominator placement.
*   **The Random Association (D):** Students who panic and try to balance the expression by adding the $+4$ to both sides.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=45% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=82% C=7% D=1%
advanced: A=2% B=97% C=1% D=0%
