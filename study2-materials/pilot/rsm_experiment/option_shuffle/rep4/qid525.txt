To predict these results, I have analysed the most common misconceptions observed in Year 9 marking:

*   **Option C ($4 \frac{8}{14}$)** is the "classic" lower-ability error: adding the whole numbers, then adding the numerators and adding the denominators ($7+1$ and $10+4$).
*   **Option B ($\frac{99}{20}$)** represents students who successfully converted to improper fractions ($27/10 + 9/4 = 54/20 + 45/20$) and calculated correctly, but failed to read the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
*   **Option A ($\frac{99}{40}$)** is for those who chose a common denominator by multiplying $10 \times 4$, but failed to adjust the numerators or got confused during the conversion, resulting in a common denominator but an incorrect final value.

The **"Basic"** group usually knows they need a common denominator but often trips up on the conversion or simplifies incorrectly. The **"Proficient"** group gets the right value but often leaves it as an improper fraction, losing the final mark.

below_basic: A=15% B=5% C=70% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=30% C=5% D=60%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
