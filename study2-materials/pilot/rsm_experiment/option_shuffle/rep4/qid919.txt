In this Year 9 mock, this question specifically tests the intersection of "order of operations" and "decimal place value." The most common trap for middle-attainers is not the algebra itself, but incorrectly squaring 0.3 to get 0.9. High-ability students occasionally trip up by multiplying before squaring, leading them to A.

**Misconception Breakdown:**
*   **A (1.8):** BIDMAS failure. The student does $(3 \times 0.3)^2$, which is $0.9^2 = 0.81$ (ironically usually making a decimal error here too) or simply $(3 \times 0.3) \times 2$. 
*   **B (0.81):** Double error. They do $(3 \times 0.3)^2$ and get $0.9^2$, correctly identifying $9 \times 9 = 81$ but misplacing the decimal.
*   **C (2.7):** Place value error. They know $0.3^2 = 0.09$, but they mentally process it as $0.9$ (forgetting the second decimal place), then $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$. This is a very "attractive" wrong answer for mid-range students.
*   **D (0.27):** The correct answer ($3 \times 0.09$).
