In this Year 9 mock, students find addition of mixed numbers relatively straightforward when denominators are common, but the presence of distractors targeting fraction conventions (adding denominators) and conversion formats often catches out the middle and lower bands.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A ($ \frac{18}{10} $):** The "Double Jeopardy" error. The student adds the numerators ($11 + 7 = 18$) but also adds the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$). Usually seen in the bottom 10%.
*   **B ($ 3 \frac{3}{5} $):** **Correct.** Most students add the integers (3) and the fractions ($ \frac{3}{5} $) independently.
*   **C ($ 3 \frac{3}{10} $):** The most "attractive" trap. Students correctly add the whole numbers but follow the "addition" rule for both parts of the fraction, adding $5+5$ to get 10. This feels intuitively "fair" to lower-ability students.
*   **D ($ \frac{18}{5} $):** The "Instruction Failure." Students correctly convert to improper fractions and add them ($ \frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5} $), but they fail to convert back to a mixed number as requested by the prompt. Proficient students often fall here by rushing.
