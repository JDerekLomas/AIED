In this Year 9 mock, this question is a classic "trap" question designed to test conceptual understanding of zero and the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

**The Thought Process:**
*   **The Trap of A:** Many students at lower ability levels believe that zero "doesn't count." They sum the non-zero digits and divide by 4. This is the most common misconception.
*   **The Trap of D:** This tests BIDMAS. Students who know the method (add then divide) but don't understand notation will pick this, unaware that without brackets, only the 7 is being divided by 5.
*   **Proficient Students:** These students know B is correct because they recognize 0 as a valid data point that must be included in the count of the denominator.
*   **Advanced Students:** The highest achievers rarely fall for A or D, but a small percentage might overthink it and choose C if they are looking for a bracketed version of D.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on a standard UK Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=55% B=15% C=5% D=25%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=15% B=70% C=2% D=13%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
