To predict the performance of 200 Year 9 students on this question, we must look at the specific psychological traps of Step 2.

**Error Analysis:**
*   **Step 1:** Is mathematically sound ($15 \times 4 = 60$). Most students across all levels recognise the need to "undo" the division.
*   **Step 2:** Is the "trap." Isaac has incorrectly moved the $+1$ by adding it to $60$ rather than subtracting it ($60 = 1 + k \implies 60 - 1 = k$).
*   **The Trap:** Many "Basic" students see the $+1$ and instinctively add $1$ to the other side because they are used to numbers "becoming bigger" in calculations, or they perform the operation seen in the expression ($1+k$) rather than the inverse.

**Predicted Distributions:**

**Below Basic:** These students often struggle with multi-step operations. While many recognize Step 1 is "good," they lack the fluency to check if Step 2 is correct, often assuming that because Step 1 worked, the whole thing is fine.
**Basic:** This is the highest-risk group for Option A. They are confident enough to solve $15 \times 4$ but have the "change the side, don't change the sign" misconception.
**Proficient:** These students usually have good algebraic foundations. They will see that $61 = 1 + k$ doesn't make sense, but a small percentage will work too quickly and choose A by accident.
**Advanced:** These students check the solution $k=59$. They will immediately spot the sign error in Step 2.
