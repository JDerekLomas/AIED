To arrive at these percentages, I have considered the following common Year 9 misconceptions:

*   **Tom's method (+5 to both sides):** This is the "standard" first step taught in UK classrooms (isolate the $x$ term). It is highly intuitive. Most students will recognise this as correct.
*   **Katie's method (×3 to all terms):** This is a classic "trap" for Year 9. To multiply by 3 correctly, Katie must multiply *every* term, including the -5 (to get $x - 15 = 36$). Many students mistakenly believe you only multiply the fraction and the answer on the right-hand side. This makes Katie's incorrect logic very "attractive" to students who understand the inverse of division is multiplication but forget to maintain the balance of the linear equation.
*   **The "Both" Trap:** Mid-to-low ability students often assume that in "Who is correct?" questions, there's a trick and both methods usually work, leading them to select Option A if both lines look "mathsy" enough.
