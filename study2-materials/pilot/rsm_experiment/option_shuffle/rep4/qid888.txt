To provide these predictions, I have considered the classic pitfalls of the FOIL method/grid method for Year 9 students:

*   **Option A:** This student ignores the signs entirely, treating $-5$ and $-7$ as positive integers. They understand the structure of a quadratic but lack directed number fluency.
*   **Option B:** This student makes the "sum/difference" error, effectively calculating $-7 + 5$ for the middle term or simply choosing a different sign combination because "two negatives make a positive" is misapplied to the addition rather than the multiplication.
*   **Option C:** This is the most "attractive" trap. The student correctly adds $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12m$, but fails the final step, concluding that $-5 \times -7$ must be $-35$. This is the "lazy sign" error that persists even into Higher tier.
*   **Option D:** The correct answer, requiring mastery of the distributive law and directed numbers (negative $\times$ negative = positive).

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 mock papers:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=45% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=30% D=60%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=8% D=90%
