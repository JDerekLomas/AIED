This question tests Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and directed number arithmetic. 

The primary "trap" is the order of addition and subtraction. Many students mistakenly believe that Addition (A) must always come before Subtraction (S), leading them to calculate $5+8=13$ then $3-13 = -10$ (Option D). Others will work strictly left-to-right, ignoring the multiplication priority, leading to $3-5=-2$, $-2+4=2$, $2 \times 2 = 4$ (Option B). Some will combine both errors, adding 5 and 4 first: $3-9 = -6$, $-6 \times 2 = -12$ (Option C).

The correct path is $4 \times 2 = 8$, followed by $3 - 5 = -2$, and $-2 + 8 = 6$ (Option A).
