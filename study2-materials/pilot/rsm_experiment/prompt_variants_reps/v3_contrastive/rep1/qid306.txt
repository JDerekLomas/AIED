This question is a classic test of "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS) that targets a very specific and widespread misconception regarding the "Addition/Subtraction" priority.

Many students are taught the acronym BIDMAS and incorrectly believe that because 'A' comes before 'S', they must always perform addition before subtraction. This makes **Problem P** the "trap" part of the question. In reality, addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be performed from left to right. Therefore, in Problem P ($4-5+6$), you should do $4-5$ first. In **Problem Q**, the standard rule of Multiplication before Addition applies ($5 \times 6$ first).

**Analysis of student performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often default to reading left-to-right for everything, ignoring order of operations rules. They are highly likely to choose **A** because it follows the natural reading order for both problems.
*   **Basic/Proficient:** This is where the "Addition before Subtraction" misconception is most prevalent. These students have learned BIDMAS but haven't mastered the "left-to-right" nuance for equal-priority operations. They will identify the multiplication in Q correctly but fall for the trap in P, leading them to **D**.
*   **Advanced:** These students understand that + and - are inverse operations with equal priority and will correctly identify **B**.

below_basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
basic: A=30% B=30% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=55% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=2% B=92% C=1% D=5%
