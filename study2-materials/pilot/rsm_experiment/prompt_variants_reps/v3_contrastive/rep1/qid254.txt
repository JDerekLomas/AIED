As a UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because it tests three distinct procedural and conceptual points: the treatment of zero in a data set, the correct divisor for a mean, and the mathematical hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **Option A is correct.** Students often mistakenly believe zero "doesn't count," but the calculation correctly sums all values (the zero is mathematically trivial to the sum but included in the count) and divides by 5.
*   **Option B** is a classic "calculator error." Students writing it in a line without brackets are performing $0+1+3+4+(7 \div 5)$. Even though it looks "orderly," it is mathematically wrong.
*   **Option C** represents the common misconception that zero doesn't count towards the denominator.
*   **Option D** attracts students who think that because the $0$ isn't explicitly written in the numerator of Option A, it must be wrong (failing to realise $0+1+3+4+7$ is identical to $1+3+4+7$).

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=3% C=3% D=2%

**Teacher’s Note:** The "Below Basic" group will likely gravitate towards Option C because they see four non-zero numbers. "Basic" level students often get caught by Option B because it mimics how they might type it into a basic scientific calculator without pressing equals before the division. "Proficient" students usually recognise that $0$ doesn't change the sum but must be included in the count.
