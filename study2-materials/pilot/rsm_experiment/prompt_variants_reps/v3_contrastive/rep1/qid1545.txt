This question tests the understanding of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

The key challenge here is that many students, particularly at the lower ability levels, tend to work from left to right regardless of the operators involved. For the expression $8 + 12 \div 4$, a common error is to calculate $(8+12) = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$. If a student makes this mistake, they will see both sides as equal and choose option **C**.

Students at the **below_basic** level are highly likely to work left-to-right on the first expression, find that $5 = 5$, and select C. At the **basic** level, students often remember that "brackets come first" (handling the right side correctly) but forget that "division comes before addition" (mishandling the left side), leading to the same error. **Proficient** students usually recognise the need for BIDMAS on both sides, while **advanced** students will see the structure of the expressions immediately without needing to complete the full calculation.

Option **D** is rarely chosen as "greater than or equal to" is often perceived as "too complex" for a simple arithmetic comparison by students who are guessing.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=10% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
