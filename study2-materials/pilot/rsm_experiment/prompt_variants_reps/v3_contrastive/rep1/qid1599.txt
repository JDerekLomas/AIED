This question tests the transition from arithmetic notation ($\div$) to algebraic notation (the fraction bar). While the concept is foundational, students often struggle with the "order" of the fraction and the grouping of terms in the denominator.

Option D is a common "reversal" error, where students mistakenly believe the first term goes on the bottom. Option C tests whether students understand that the $(h+4)$ is a single entity; those who view it as a sequence of operations often "separate" the 4. Option B is a distractor for students who guess based on visual pattern matching or a misunderstanding of how terms distribute.

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with which variable goes on top and may be tempted by Option B because it "balances" the $c$ and $h$ visually, or Option D due to a 50/50 guess on the orientation of the fraction.
*   **Basic:** Most recognize that the fraction bar represents division, but many will still choose D (inverting the numerator and denominator) or C (forgetting that the expression in brackets must stay together).
*   **Proficient:** These students have generally mastered the convention that the first term is the numerator. They are unlikely to choose B or D, though a small percentage might slip up on C.
*   **Advanced:** This is a trivial question for this group; errors will be negligible/accidental.

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=65% B=5% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=88% B=2% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
