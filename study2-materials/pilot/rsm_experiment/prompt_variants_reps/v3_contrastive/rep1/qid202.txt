This question tests the addition of mixed numbers with common denominators. It is considered a "low-demand" fractions question because there is no regrouping/carrying required (the sum of the fractional parts is less than 1).

The primary distractor for lower-ability students is **Option D**, representing the common misconception of adding both the numerators and the denominators. **Option B** is mathematically correct but violates the instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number; this catches "basic" and "proficient" students who forget to read the final constraint. **Option C** is a "blind" error where the student adds denominators and disregards the whole numbers entirely or miscalculates them significantly.

Because the numbers are small and the denominators are already the same, a high percentage of students across the board will find this straightforward.

below_basic: A=50% B=10% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
