This question is a classic test of "order of operations" in reverse within the context of linear equations. It addresses a very specific and common misconception regarding which operation to "undo" first and how the multiplication applies to the rest of the equation.

**Tom's method** (Adding 5 to both sides) is the standard and most intuitive first step for most students. This yields $\frac{x}{3} = 17$. 
**Katie's method** (Multiplying by 3) is a valid mathematical step, but it is the most common pitfall in GCSE algebra. Students often forget that if you multiply by 3, you must multiply **every** term on both sides, resulting in $x - 15 = 36$. Katie has only multiplied the $\frac{x}{3}$ and the $12$, failing to multiply the $-5$.

**Predicting Student Performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with algebraic manipulation. Many will think only one way can be right, or they will guess "Neither" if they find the numbers confusing. They are susceptible to thinking Katie looks "smart" for multiplying first.
*   **Basic:** This group usually knows the "standard" way (Tom's way) but often falls into the trap of thinking Katie's method is a clever shortcut. They often fail to spot that the $-5$ wasn't multiplied.
*   **Proficient:** These students are solid with Tom's method but will look closely at Katie's. This is where the highest percentage of "Only Tom" (Option A) occurs because they have been warned specifically about Katie's error by their teachers.
*   **Advanced:** These students will instantly recognize that Katie failed to multiply the constant term. They will confidently choose A.
