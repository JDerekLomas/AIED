This question tests the addition of mixed numbers with unequal denominators. It is a standard GCSE foundation/higher and KS3 topic.

The primary traps in this specific question are:
1.  **D: Adding across.** Adding the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$). This is the most common error for low-ability students.
2.  **A: Not following the instruction.** This is the correct value ($4 \frac{19}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$) but given as an improper fraction rather than the requested mixed number. 
3.  **C: Common denominator error.** Multiplying the denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but failing to adjust numerators correctly, or just a general confusion with improper fraction conversion.

**Teacher's Note:** Advanced students will effortlessly find the common denominator of 20 and convert. Proficient students might reach the correct value but may briefly consider Option A if they converted to improper fractions first. Basic students are highly likely to go for D because it requires the least cognitive load.
