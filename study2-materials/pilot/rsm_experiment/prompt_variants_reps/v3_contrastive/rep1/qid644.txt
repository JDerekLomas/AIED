This question tests a very specific step within the FOIL/expanding brackets process: multiplying the "Last" terms, both of which are negative.

The primary difficulty here is the double negative ($-1 \times -4$). While proficient and advanced students will find this trivial, students at lower ability levels often struggle to distinguish between when to multiply and when to add (or subtract) the numbers. 

Option D ($ -5 $) is the most common distractor for lower-ability students, as they see $-1$ and $-4$ and intuitively perform an addition/combination of two negative values ($ -1 - 4 = -5 $). Option C ($ +5 $) is for those who add but believe "two negatives make a positive" applies to every operation. Option B ($ -4 $) captures students who know to multiply but fail to apply the signs correctly.
