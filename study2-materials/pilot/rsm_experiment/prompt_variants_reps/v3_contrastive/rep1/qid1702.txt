To solve this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, and $x = 3.3$.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
This question tests the ability to substitute into a linear equation in two variables. 
- **Option C (3.3)** is the correct answer.
- **Option A (4.25)** and **B (-4.25)** are common distractors for students who confuse the positions of $x$ and $y$ in the table. If a student substitutes $x = 0.5$, they get $5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y \approx -4.16$ or similar calculation errors, but these options more likely come from sign errors or rearranging the formula incorrectly before substituting.
- **Option D (2.7)** is the most common trap for "Below Basic" and "Basic" students. It comes from a sign error: $10x - 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 27 \rightarrow x = 2.7$. These students correctly substitute $0.5$ and get $3$, but subtract it from 30 instead of adding it when moving it to the other side of the equation.

Because the equation is in the form $ax - by = c$, the negative sign before the $6y$ is a classic "sign-change" trap during the inverse operation phase of solving.
