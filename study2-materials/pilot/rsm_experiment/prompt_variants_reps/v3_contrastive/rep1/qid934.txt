As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've analysed this question. It tests the ability to substitute values into a linear equation that is not in the explicit form ($y=mx+c$). 

The "star" is at $x=0$. This is a common point of confusion for lower-ability students who often treat the "0" as irrelevant or incorrectly perform operations like $10 \div 4$. 

**Key challenges for this specific question:**
1. **Implicit Form:** The equation $4x+2y=10$ requires two steps to solve for $y$: $4(0) = 0$, then $2y=10$, so $y=5$. 
2. **Distractor A (20):** Students might incorrectly multiply 4 and 5, or perform $4 \times 0$ and then somehow involve the 2 and 10 multiplicatively ($2 \times 10$).
3. **Distractor B (3):** This is the value for $x=1$ ($4+2y=10 \rightarrow 2y=6$). Students often look at the next column or misalign their calculation.
4. **Distractor D (2.5):** This is a very common error ($10 \div 4$). Students ignore the $y$ term or the structure and simply divide the total by the coefficient of $x$.

Despite the traps, $x=0$ is the easiest substitution to make, which typically leads to a higher success rate for proficient students.
