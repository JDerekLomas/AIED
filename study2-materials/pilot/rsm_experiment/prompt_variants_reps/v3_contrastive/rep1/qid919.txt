This question targets two primary areas of difficulty for UK students: the order of operations (BIDMAS) and squaring decimals. 

The most common trap here is squaring $3x$ instead of $3(x^2)$, leading students to $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$ (Option A). The second common trap is failing to handle the decimal correctly when squaring $0.3$, often resulting in $0.3^2 = 0.9$, then $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ (Option D). Option B ($0.27$) is the correct calculation: $0.3^2 = 0.09$, and $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. Option C is a simple linear error ($3 \times 2 \times 0.3$).

Below basic students often struggle with the decimal place value, whereas proficient students usually know to square first but frequently miss the extra decimal place (making D a very high-frequency "distractor").

basic: A=35% B=25% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=20% B=45% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=5% B=85% C=0% D=10%
