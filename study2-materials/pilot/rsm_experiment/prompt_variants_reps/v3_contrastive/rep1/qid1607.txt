In this question, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4), but Step 2 contains a very common algebraic error: adding 1 to the left side instead of subtracting it to isolate $k$.

This question is a classic "diagnostic" probe for the "change the side, change the sign" misconception. Students at lower ability levels often see the $+1$ and instinctively think they need to add $1$ to the $60$, rather than performing the inverse operation. High-performing students will instantly spot that $60-1 = 59$ and identify Step 2 as incorrect.

The "Below Basic" group often struggles with the first step (the multiplication), but since the question asks "Which steps are correct?", many will assume that at least one step must be right, or they will see "61" and think "60 and 1 makes 61" without considering the balancing of the equation.
