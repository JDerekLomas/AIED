As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as one that specifically targets a student's fluency with fractional division and their ability to resist "intuitive" number bonds.

While $3p = 12$ would result in $4$, and $p/3 = 12$ would result in $36$, the combination of a coefficient and a unit fraction is a notorious "trip-up" point. Many students at the lower end see $3$ and $12$ and instinctively gravitate toward $4$ or $1/4$ because $12 \div 3 = 4$. Students often multiply by the coefficient instead of dividing when a fraction is involved, leading them to $3/12 = 1/4$ or simply $3 \times 12 = 36$ (which, if they remember the variable is on the left, leads to the correct $1/36$).

The most common error here is Option A ($1/4$), driven by the visual cue of $12 \div 3$ and placing it back into the fraction. Option B is correct ($\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{36}$). Option C is for those who ignore the fraction line entirely. Option D is a rarer error involving squaring or incorrect manipulation.
