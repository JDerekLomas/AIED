This question tests the ability to rearrange the formula for the volume of a sphere: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

While the concept is straightforward, the algebraic manipulation involved—specifically dealing with a fraction and multiple variables under a cube root—poses a significant challenge for UK students.

**Common Traps:**
*   **The "Flip" Error (Option B):** Many students know they need to "get rid of the $\frac{4}{3}$" but often multiply by the numerator instead of the reciprocal, leading to $\frac{4V}{3\pi}$.
*   **The $\pi$ placement (Option A):** Students frequently struggle with whether $\pi$ is in the numerator or denominator when rearranging, often instinctively grouping it with the "main" numbers.
*   **The Cube Root Scope (Option D):** Lower-ability students often fail to realize the entire expression must be under the radical, or they try to square/cube components individually in a mathematically inconsistent way.

**Student Performance Distribution:**
*   **Below Basic (Grade 1-3):** Likely to guess based on visual familiarity. They might choose D because the $\sqrt[3]{V}$ looks like a standard "reverse" operation they recognize, or A because it looks "busy."
*   **Basic (Grade 4-5):** Will remember the sphere formula but stumble on the two-step rearrangement (multiplying by 3 and dividing by 4). Option B is a very common "half-way" error here.
*   **Proficient (Grade 6-7):** Most will successfully multiply by 3 and divide by $4\pi$. The main errors here are simple clerical slips or mixing up the radius/volume formulas.
*   **Advanced (Grade 8-9):** These students should handle literal equations with ease. If they miss it, it’s usually due to extreme rushing rather than a lack of understanding.
