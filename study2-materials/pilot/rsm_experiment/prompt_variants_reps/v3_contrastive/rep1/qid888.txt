This question is a standard quadratic expansion that tests three specific skills: the FOIL method (or grid method), the addition of two negative numbers, and the multiplication of two negative numbers.

The "trap" here lies in the signs. Many students correctly identify that $5+7=12$, but struggle with the $-5 \times -7$ component. Option D is a very common distractor for students who know they need to add the numbers for the middle term but believe that a "minus and a minus make a minus" regardless of whether they are adding or multiplying. Option A represents a student subtracting the 5 from the 7 (or vice versa) to get the middle term, a mistake often seen when students are rushed or lack a solid grasp of the distributive property.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
