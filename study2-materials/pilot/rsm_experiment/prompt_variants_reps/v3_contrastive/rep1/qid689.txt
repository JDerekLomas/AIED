This question specifically tests the student's ability to handle equations where the unknown is in the denominator. This is a notorious "trip-wire" in GCSE mathematics. 

Lower-ability students almost instinctively perform the operation $10 \times 5$ because they see the division sign and attempt to "do the inverse" without considering the position of $p$, leading to option B ($50$). Middle-ability students often realize that $p$ must be smaller than 5, but frequently perform the calculation $10 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 10$, leading to option C ($2$). Students who have mastered the "swap" method or understand that $10p = 5$ will correctly identify $0.5$. Option D is a rare choice, usually reserved for students who are completely overwhelmed by the structure.
