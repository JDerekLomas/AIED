This question specifically tests the understanding of multiplicative inverses (reciprocals) in the context of negative numbers. 

The most common trap here is the "sign-change" misconception. Students are taught that the product of a number and its reciprocal is $1$. Many students incorrectly assume that to get $-1$, they must change the sign of the multiplier, failing to realize that $(- \text{something}) \times (+ \text{something})$ already results in a negative value. Therefore, Option A is a very strong distractor for all but the most advanced students.

**Below Basic:** These students often struggle with fractions and negative signs simultaneously. Many will pick C or D because they see the numbers in the question and look for a match, or pick A because they remember "flip the fraction" but don't grasp the sign rules.
**Basic:** These students usually know that $3/4$ and $4/3$ are related. However, they frequently over-apply the rule "to get a negative answer, you need a positive and a negative," leading them to choose A. They often think that since the target is $-1$, the second number should be positive.
**Proficient:** These students understand reciprocals well but can still be caught out by a momentary lapse in sign logic. They are much less likely to choose C or D, but A remains a significant draw.
**Advanced:** These students will instinctively know that a negative times a positive is a negative, and that $3/4 \times 4/3 = 1$. They are highly likely to get this correct, though a small percentage may overthink and pick B.

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=10% B=88% C=1% D=1%
