This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. While mathematically simple, it triggers a very specific mechanical error: the instinct to multiply the two visible numbers ($10 \times 5$) or to divide the larger by the smaller regardless of position ($10 \div 5$).

The presence of $0.5$ (Option A) and $2$ (Option C) makes this a high-discrimination question. Students who understand that $p$ must be a small number to make the fraction large will navigate to $0.5$. Students who simply see "10 and 5" and perform a standard division will fall into the trap of Option C. Option B attracts students who lack algebraic structure and just "multiply to get rid of the fraction" without considering which side $p$ is on.

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often guess or perform a simple multiplication ($10 \times 5$) resulting in B, or pick C because "10 divided by 5 is 2".
*   **Basic:** The most likely group to choose C. They have learned that equations involve division, but they habitually divide the number on the left by the number on the right ($10 \div 5$).
*   **Proficient:** Usually recognise that $p$ must be $0.5$ because $5 \div 0.5 = 10$, or they successfully rearrange the equation to $10p = 5$.
*   **Advanced:** Rarely miss this, though a "speed error" resulting in C is occasionally seen.
