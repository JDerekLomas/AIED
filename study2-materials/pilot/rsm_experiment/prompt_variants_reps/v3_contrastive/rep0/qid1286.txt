This question tests a student's ability to rearrange a formula involving a cube root, specifically the volume of a sphere: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

The primary difficulty lies in the algebraic manipulation of fractions and constants. 
- **Option C** is the correct rearrangement: multiply by 3, divide by $4\pi$, then take the cube root.
- **Option A** is a common error where students move the $4\pi$ to the numerator instead of the denominator when "clearing" the fraction.
- **Option B** reflects a partial understanding where the student forgets to multiply $V$ by 3 (or divides by the 3 instead).
- **Option D** represents a significant misunderstanding of radical rules, where the student attempts to "take things out" of the cube root incorrectly or simply associates the numbers in a linear fashion.

This is a "high-tier" GCSE topic (Level 6/7). Students at the lower end of the ability spectrum often guess or choose options that look "balanced" without performing the steps.
