This question tests Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). While the multiplication is relatively straightforward, the primary "trap" is the order of addition and subtraction. 

The correct calculation is $3 - 5 + (4 \times 2) \Rightarrow 3 - 5 + 8 \Rightarrow -2 + 8 = 6$ (Option A).

Common errors expected:
1. **Left-to-right error (ignoring BIDMAS):** $(3 - 5 + 4) \times 2 \Rightarrow (2) \times 2 = 4$ (Option B).
2. **Addition before Subtraction (BIDMAS misconception):** Some students are taught "Addition before Subtraction" too literally. They calculate $3 - (5 + 8) \Rightarrow 3 - 13 = -10$ (Option D).
3. **Severe operational errors:** $3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 \Rightarrow 3 - 18 = -15$ (Not listed) or $3 - 5 + 4 = -6 \times 2 = -12$ (Option C).

The most common distractor for lower-ability students is Option B, as the left-to-right impulse is strong. Mid-ability students often fall for Option D due to the rigid mnemonic application.
