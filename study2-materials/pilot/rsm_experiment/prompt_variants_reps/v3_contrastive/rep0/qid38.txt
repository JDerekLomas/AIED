As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen that adding algebraic fractions is a classic stumbling block. Here is my analysis for this specific question:

The primary challenge here is the unequal denominators. While both involve $x$, the coefficients (2 and 1) require students to find a common denominator. 

*   **Option A (Correct):** Students recognize they need a common denominator of $2x$. They multiply the second fraction by $2/2$ to get $8/2x$, and then $3+8=11$.
*   **Option B:** This represents the most common "naive" error: adding the numerators $(3+4=7)$ and adding the denominators $(2x+x=3x)$. This is extremely common among 'below_basic' and 'basic' students.
*   **Option C:** This happens when a student realizes they need a common denominator but forgets to multiply the numerator of the second fraction, then incorrectly simplifies $2x$ down to $x$ or simply ignores the 2.
*   **Option D:** Students add the numerators $(3+4=7)$ but correctly identify that they should keep a common denominator (often picking the larger one, $2x$), but fail to adjust the numerator accordingly.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=15% B=55% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=82% B=8% C=4% D=6%
advanced: A=97% B=1% C=1% D=1%
