This question tests the expansion of a quadratic expression where both constants are negative. This is a common stumbling block for UK students due to the directed number arithmetic involved—specifically, the sum of two negatives and the product of two negatives.

The primary distractors focus on two common errors:
1. **Option A (The Difference Error):** Students subtract 5 from 7 (or vice versa) to get -2, rather than adding -5 and -7. 
2. **Option D (The Product Error):** Students correctly calculate $-5 - 7 = -12$ but then think that a "minus and a minus make a minus" when multiplying, resulting in -35 instead of +35. This is the most common error among intermediate students.
3. **Option C (The Sign Flip):** Students often associate the two negatives in the brackets with a "positive result" and simply change all signs to plus.

**Difficulty analysis:** This is a mid-tier difficulty question for double bracket expansion because of the double negative. It is significantly harder than $(m+5)(m+7)$.
