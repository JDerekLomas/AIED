As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this question by identifying two main hurdles: the "zero" in the data set and the rules of BIDMAS/Order of Operations.

1.  **The Zero Problem:** Lower-ability students often ignore zero when calculating the mean, believing it "doesn't count." This leads them to divide by 4 (Option C).
2.  **The BIDMAS Trap:** Option B is a classic trap. While it contains the right numbers and division by 5, the lack of brackets means that, mathematically, only the 7 is being divided by 5. Many "basic" students see the string of numbers and the divide sign and assume it represents the process they would type into a basic calculator one-by-one.
3.  **The Identity of A:** Option A is mathematically correct because $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$ is equal to $1 + 3 + 4 + 7$. However, many students feel "0" must be visible in the numerator for the sum to be "correct."

Here is the predicted breakdown:

**below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=45% D=5%**
*At this level, the most common error is ignoring the zero entirely, leading to Option C. They see four "real" numbers and want to divide by 4. Others will pick B because it "looks like" the sum they would perform.*

**basic: A=35% B=30% C=25% D=10%**
*These students are torn. Many know they must divide by 5, but they are highly susceptible to the "looks right" nature of Option B. Some will still fall for the "divide by 4" trap but fewer than the below-basic group.*

**proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%**
*Proficient students recognize that including 0 in the addition doesn't change the total, so they see A is correct. Some will still be caught by the BIDMAS trap in B if they are rushing.*

**advanced: A=92% B=3% C=2% D=3%**
*Advanced students quickly identify that A is the only mathematically sound expression. They immediately spot the BIDMAS error in B and the count error in C.*
