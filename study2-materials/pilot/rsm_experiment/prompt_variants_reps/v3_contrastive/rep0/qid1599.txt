This question tests a student's ability to translate a division operation involving a bracketed expression into a formal algebraic fraction. While it is a fundamental skill, the placement of the variables and the structure of the expression reveal common misconceptions regarding the order of operations and "denominator vs. numerator" orientation.

**A (Correct Answer):** The most direct translation. Most students across the board will recognise the vinculum as the division symbol.
**B (Variable Error):** This appeals to students who believe algebraic expressions should look "symmetrical" or who mistakenly try to involve the first variable in both parts of the fraction.
**C (Order of Operations Error):** This is a very common mistake for lower-ability students who ignore the importance of the bracket in the expression $c \div (h+4)$, effectively treating it as $c \div h + 4$.
**D (Orientation Error):** This reflects a confusion about which part of a division calculation becomes the numerator and which becomes the denominator—a persistent error for students who haven't fully internalised that the divisor follows the fraction bar.

The simplicity of the letters used makes this relatively accessible, but the "bracket" element is the primary hurdle for the lower two tiers.
