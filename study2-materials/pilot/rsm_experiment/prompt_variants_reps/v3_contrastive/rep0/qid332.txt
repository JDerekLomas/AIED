This question is a classic test of "order of operations" in reverse within the context of linear equations. It addresses a common point of confusion: when to multiply by the denominator versus when to add/subtract the constant term.

**Tom's method** follows the standard "isolate the term" approach ($+5$ to both sides). Most students recognize this as the "proper" way, making Tom very popular across all ability levels.

**Katie's method** represents a common mistake. She has multiplied by 3 but failed to distribute that multiplication to the $-5$ term. This is a very "sticky" misconception. Students at lower levels often believe you can simply "get rid" of a fraction by multiplying just the numerator's side, while proficient students might recognize that you *can* multiply first, but Katie has done it incorrectly (it should be $x - 15 = 36$).

**The Trap:** Many students believe only one person can be right in these "Tom and Katie" style questions. Because Tom is clearly right, they often stop looking and choose A. Only the advanced students will scrutinize Katie's algebra enough to realise her mistake is failing to multiply the 5.
