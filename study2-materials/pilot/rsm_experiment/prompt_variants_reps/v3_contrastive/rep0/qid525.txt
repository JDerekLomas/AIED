As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've analyzed this specific question. It tests the addition of mixed numbers with different denominators. 

The main "traps" here are:
1. **The Format Trap**: Option A is the correct numerical value but as an improper fraction ($\frac{99}{20}$). Since the question explicitly asks for a **mixed number**, students who calculate correctly but don't read the final instruction will lose the mark.
2. **The "Add Across" Misconception**: Option D ($4 \frac{8}{14}$) is the classic error where students add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), then add the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$). 
3. **Common Denominator Error**: Option C represents a failure to scale numerators correctly or a confusion in find the LCM (using $10 \times 4 = 40$ but not adjusting numerators correctly).

**Ability Level Analysis:**
- **Below Basic**: These students almost instinctively "add across" (Option D). It looks logical to them, and it is a very common plateau for students struggling with fractions.
- **Basic**: These students know they need a common denominator. However, they often forget the final instruction to provide a mixed number or make a processing error. They are heavily split between the correct method (B) and the "add across" trap (D).
- **Proficient**: These students will consistently find the common denominator of 20. However, a significant minority will perform the calculation correctly (reaching $4 \frac{19}{20}$ or $\frac{99}{20}$) but select A because it matches their calculator output or initial improper fraction conversion, ignoring the "mixed number" constraint.
- **Advanced**: These students will identify the correct common denominator quickly and respect the formatting constraint (B).

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
