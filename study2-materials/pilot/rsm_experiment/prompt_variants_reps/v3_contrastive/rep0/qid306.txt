This question is a classic test of "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS) that highlights a very specific and frequent misconception regarding the relationship between Addition and Subtraction.

In Problem Q, most students (even at lower levels) recognize that multiplication comes before addition. However, Problem P contains the "BIDMAS trap": because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym, many students wrongly believe they must perform addition before subtraction, even when the subtraction appears first in the left-to-right sequence. This leads them to choose $5+6$ as the first step for Problem P, which is a mathematical error ($4-11 \neq -1+6$).

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=15% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=55% C=5% D=35%
advanced: A=2% B=88% C=0% D=10%

**Analysis:**
- **The "D" Trap:** This is the most popular incorrect answer. Even many proficient students fall for the idea that "Addition always comes before Subtraction" because of how they memorized the acronym.
- **Problem Q:** Is a "threshold" check. Almost no advanced or proficient students will pick A or C because they know $5 \times 6$ comes first. 
- **The Correct Answer (B):** In Problem P, Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and are solved left-to-right. Therefore, $4-5$ is the correct first step. Many students find this counter-intuitive when the acronym is taught rigidly.
