This question tests a student's ability to multiply two negative integers within the context of expanding brackets. The arrows specifically highlight the "Last" terms of the FOIL method: $-1$ and $-4$.

The difficulty lies in two areas: the "minus times a minus" rule (Option B) and the confusion between multiplying and adding/subtracting the numbers (Options C and D). For many "below basic" students, the visual of two minus signs often triggers an addition operation ($-1 - 4 = -5$) rather than multiplication. "Basic" students often remember to multiply but forget the sign rule.

**Below basic:** These students often struggle with the operation required. They see -1 and -4 and perform an addition or subtraction, leading them to -5.
**Basic:** These students know they need to multiply $1 \times 4$, but the sign rule is inconsistent. Option B is a very common "trap" for students who don't associate the sign to the left as belonging to the number.
**Proficient:** These students generally know that "two minuses make a plus" when multiplying and will correctly identify $+4$.
**Advanced:** This is a trivial step for advanced students; errors would only be due to extreme carelessness.

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=45% B=40% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=12% C=1% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
