This question tests the addition of mixed numbers with common denominators. It is considered an "easy" version of the topic because there is no requirement to find a common denominator, and the sum of the fractions ($\frac{3}{5}$) does not exceed a whole, meaning no "carrying" or regrouping is required.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A (Correct):** The sum of the integers ($2+1=3$) and the fractions ($\frac{1}{5}+\frac{2}{5}=\frac{3}{5}$).
*   **B (Misinterpretation of format):** This is the correct numerical value expressed as an improper fraction. The instruction explicitly asks for a "mixed number," so many students—especially basic/proficient ones—will skip this, though some may choose it if they convert everything to improper fractions first and forget to convert back.
*   **C (Computational Error):** Adding both the numerators and the denominators ($1+2=3, 5+5=10$) and ignoring the whole numbers.
*   **D (The "Add Denominators" Trap):** The most common misconception in fraction addition where students add the whole numbers correctly but add the denominators together ($5+5=10$).

**Predictions:**
The simplicity of the numbers means a high success rate for proficient and advanced students. The "trap" of adding denominators (Option D) is the primary distractor for below-basic students.

below_basic: A=45% B=5% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=92% B=4% C=1% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
