This question specifically tests the intersection of substituting into a quadratic formula and decimal place value. The core difficulty lies in calculating $0.3^2$. Many students erroneously believe $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ (which leads to answer D) or they perform the multiplication out of order ($3 \times 0.3$ then square it, leading to answer A).

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A ($0.81$):** Common error where students multiply $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ first, then square it ($0.9^2 = 0.81$). This shows a BIDMAS/Order of Operations error.
*   **B ($0.27$):** The correct answer ($0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$; $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$).
*   **C ($1.8$):** A calculation error often resulting from doubling $0.3$ (thinking $x^2$ is $x \times 2$) to get $0.6$, then multiplying by $3$.
*   **D ($2.7$):** The most common "distractor." Students correctly prioritise the power, but incorrectly calculate $0.3^2 = 0.9$ (forgetting the second decimal place). Then $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$.
