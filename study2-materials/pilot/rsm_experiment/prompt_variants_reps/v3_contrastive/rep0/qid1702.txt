To answer this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the linear equation $10x - 6y = 30$ and solve for $x$.

**Analysis:**
This question is moderately difficult because the $y$-value is a decimal (0.5), and the equation is in the form $ax - by = c$. 
- The calculation is: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$.
- **Distractor A (4.25):** Students might incorrectly add the 6 and 30 before dealing with the $y$ substitution or confuse the roles of $x$ and $y$. However, it is most likely a "guess" or a miscalculation of $30 + 12.5$ or similar.
- **Distractor C (3.3):** The correct answer.
- **Distractor D (2.7):** A very common error where students subtract 3 instead of adding it ($10x + 3 = 30$ instead of $10x - 3 = 30$), resulting in $10x = 27$. This is the primary "trap" for students who struggle with balancing equations.

Low-ability students often struggle with the two-step nature of the equation once substituted, while advanced students will handle the negative sign and the decimal correctly.
