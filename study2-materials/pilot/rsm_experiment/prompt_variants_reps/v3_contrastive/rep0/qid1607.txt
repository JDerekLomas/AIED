In this question, the student is asked to evaluate a two-step algebraic process. Step 1 is correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$), but Step 2 contains a very common "change the side, change the sign" error. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60, Isaac has added it.

**Teacher Analysis:**
*   **The Trap:** Many lower-ability students see the $+1$ and instinctively add $1$ to the other side to "combine" them, or they misremember the rule for moving terms. 
*   **Ease of Step 1:** Step 1 is actually quite intuitive because $60 \div 4 = 15$. Most students, even those who struggle with formal algebra, will recognize $60$ as the correct result of the first step.
*   **Ability Split:** Lower-ability students often fail to check the final answer. If they see Step 1 is "obviously" right and Step 2 results in a nice whole number, they often select "Both" (C). Proficient students will catch the subtraction error in Step 2. Advanced students will spot it immediately.
