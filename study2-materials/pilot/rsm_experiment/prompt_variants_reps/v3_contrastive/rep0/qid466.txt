This question specifically tests two key concepts in fraction arithmetic: the multiplicative inverse (reciprocal) and the rules for multiplying negative numbers.

A common pitfall in this specific question is the "double negative" confusion. Students often remember that "two negatives make a positive," and because the target answer is $-1$ (negative), they frequently over-correct by choosing a positive multiplier (Option A). This is a very common error among students who have a procedural understanding of the reciprocal but a weak grasp of signed numbers.

*   **Option A** is the most popular distractor because it addresses the reciprocal but fails to account for the sign of the product.
*   **Option B** is the correct answer.
*   **Option C** represents a "lost sign" error and a failure to recognise the reciprocal.
*   **Option D** is for students who simply want to see the same digits on both sides of the equals sign or confuse multiplication rules with additive identities.
