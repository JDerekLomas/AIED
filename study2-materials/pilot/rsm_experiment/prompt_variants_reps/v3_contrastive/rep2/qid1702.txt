To solve this, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into $10x - 6y = 30$.
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$ (Option C)

**Teacher's Analysis:**
This is a high-discriminator question. The main trap is a sign error during the rearrangement ($10x = 30 - 3$ instead of $30 + 3$), which leads to $x = 2.7$ (Option D). Lower-ability students often struggle with the decimal $0.5$ combined with a negative coefficient, frequently trying to perform the operation "backwards" or simply guessing based on the numbers visible (10, 6, 30). Option A (4.25) represents a common mistake where students might add $10 + 6 + 1$ (half of 2) or misapply a different linear rule. Option C is the only correct path, requiring two distinct steps: correctly calculating $6 \times 0.5$ and then correctly isolating $x$.
