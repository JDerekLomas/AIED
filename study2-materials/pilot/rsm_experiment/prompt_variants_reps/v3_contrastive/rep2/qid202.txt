This question tests the addition of mixed numbers with common denominators. It is considered a relatively "safe" question for students because there is no requirement to find a common denominator or regroup (convert an improper fraction back into a mixed number), as $1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5$.

However, there are two primary traps: 
1. **The "Add Denominators" Error:** Low-ability students frequently add the bottom numbers ($5+5=10$), leading them to Option D. 
2. **Instruction Following:** Option B is numerically correct ($\frac{18}{5}$), but the question specifically asks for a **mixed number**. Proficient students who work too quickly by converting to improper fractions first might select B and overlook the final formatting instruction.

**Ability Level Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often lack a conceptual understanding of fractions as parts of a whole and treat the numerator and denominator as separate integers. They are highly likely to add the denominators (D) or simply pick numbers that look similar to the question (C).
*   **Basic:** Students at this level can usually add the whole numbers correctly ($2+1=3$) but are still prone to the misconception of adding the denominators ($5+5=10$), making D a very strong distractor.
*   **Proficient:** These students know how to add fractions but are occasionally caught out by B if they convert everything to improper fractions and forget to convert back, or D through a momentary lapse in concentration.
*   **Advanced:** These students will find this question trivial and will likely follow the formatting instruction ("mixed number") without issue.
