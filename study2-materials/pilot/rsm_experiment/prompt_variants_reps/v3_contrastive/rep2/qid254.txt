As an experienced teacher, I’ve found this specific question to be particularly effective at exposing two things: the "zero doesn't count" misconception and a reliance on calculator-syntax logic versus mathematical order of operations.

**Key Insights:**
1.  **The "Zero is Nothing" Trap:** Many lower-ability students believe that because zero has no numerical value in an addition, it doesn't count as an "item" in the denominator. This makes Option C a very strong distractor for the bottom half of the cohort.
2.  **Order of Operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS):** Option B looks correct to a student who reads "left to right," but an advanced student knows it is mathematically incorrect because the division happens before the addition ($7 \div 5$). 
3.  **The "Invisible Zero":** Option A is actually mathematically correct ($15 \div 5 = 3$), as adding zero doesn't change the numerator. However, many "Advanced" students will overthink this; they might choose D because they believe the formula *must* explicitly show the $+0$ to be "correct," even though the resulting value is identical.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=40% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=50% B=15% C=15% D=20%
advanced: A=75% B=5% C=2% D=18%
