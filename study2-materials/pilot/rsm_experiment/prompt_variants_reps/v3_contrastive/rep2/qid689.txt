This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. While it looks simple, it consistently catches out students because the division $5 \div 10$ feels "unnatural" compared to $10 \div 5$.

**Key pedagogical insights:**
1.  **The $10 \div 5$ Trap:** The most common error is students seeing the 10 and the 5 and automatically performing the easier division ($10 \div 5 = 2$). This makes **C** the strongest distractor.
2.  **The Multiplication Error:** Students who know they need to "do something with both numbers" but lack algebraic fluency often multiply them, leading to $10 \times 5 = 50$ (**B**).
3.  **Proportional reasoning vs. rote steps:** Proficient students recognize that $p$ must be smaller than 1 because 10 is larger than 5. Advanced students see $10p = 5$, therefore $p = 5/10 = 0.5$.
