This question is a significant "trap" for students across the ability spectrum because it combines two common areas of weakness: **Order of Operations (BIDMAS)** and **Squaring Decimals**.

**The Distractors:**
*   **A ($0.81$):** This is the "Double Squaring" error. The student multiplies $3$ by $0.3$ to get $0.9$, then squares $0.9$. This is a very common conceptual error where students ignore BIDMAS.
*   **C ($1.8$):** This is the "Linear" or "Addition" error. Students might do $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$ or simply double the values due to a misunderstanding of power notation.
*   **D ($2.7$):** This is the decimal place error. Students calculate $0.3^2 = 0.9$ (forgetting the second decimal place) and then multiply by $3$. 
*   **Correct (B - $0.27$):** Requires knowing that $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$, then multiplying that by $3$.

**Student Performance Prediction:**
Lower ability students almost universally ignore BIDMAS or miscalculate $0.3^2$ as $0.6$ or $0.9$. Proficient students often fall for Option A because "multiply then square" feels like a more natural left-to-right flow, or Option D because they incorrectly evaluate $0.3^2$ as $0.9$. Only the most attentive students handle the decimal places correctly.
