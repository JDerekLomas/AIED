This question specifically tests the understanding of the **multiplicative inverse (reciprocal)** combined with **directed number rules**. 

The main "trap" here is the negative sign. Many students understand that to get a result of $1$, they need to flip the fraction ($\frac{4}{3}$). However, a significant number of students believe that to "cancel out" a negative or to reach a negative result, they must use a positive number, or they simply forget the "negative times positive equals negative" rule in the heat of the moment. 

Option A is the most common distractor because students correctly identify the reciprocal but fail to account for the sign, assuming that since the answer is negative, they only need one negative sign in the calculation. Option C is chosen by lower-ability students who confuse the reciprocal with the additive inverse or simply see the numbers "3 and 4" and pick a positive version.

Here is the predicted performance distribution:

basic: A=45% B=35% C=12% D=8%
proficient: A=25% B=68% C=5% D=2%
advanced: A=8% B=91% C=1% D=0%
