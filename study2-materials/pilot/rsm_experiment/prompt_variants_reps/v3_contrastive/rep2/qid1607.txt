In this question, Isaac correctly performs the first operation (multiplying by 4 to get 60), but fails at the second step. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$ ($60 - 1 = 59$), he adds 1 to 60 ($60 + 1 = 61$).

This is a classic "inverse operation" error. However, Step 1 is handled well by many students because the visual cue of the denominator '4' clearly suggests multiplication. The error in Step 2 is very common among lower-ability students who see "$+1$" and instinctively add it to the other side rather than subtracting, or simply fail to "do the same to both sides" correctly. Advanced students will spot the error in Step 2 immediately.

**Predicting Student Responses:**

**below_basic:** A=25% B=15% C=50% D=10%
*Many students at this level believe that because they see "61" and they started with "60" and "1", it must be correct. They often assume both steps are correct if the numbers "fit".*

**basic:** A=45% B=5% C=40% D=10%
*Students here often recognize that Step 1 is correct (multiplying by 4). However, a large portion will still overlook the sign error in Step 2 or be lured into choosing C because the first step worked so well.*

**proficient:** A=85% B=2% C=10% D=3%
*Most proficient students will check the arithmetic. They will see $60 = 1 + k$ and realize that $k$ must be 59. They are highly likely to identify that only Step 1 holds up.*

**advanced:** A=97% B=1% C=1% D=1%
*Advanced students will solve the equation mentally in seconds and immediately identify the addition error in Step 2.*
