This question is a classic test of "order of operations" in reverse when solving linear equations.

Tom is correct because adding 5 to both sides is the standard first step ($\frac{x}{3} = 12 + 5 = 17$).
Katie is **incorrect** because she multiplied by 3 but failed to multiply the $-5$ term by 3. Her step should have been $x - 15 = 36$.

**Analysis of student performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many students at this level struggle with the fractional notation. They often assume that "doing the same to both sides" means just performing one operation anywhere. They will see Katie's $36$ (from $12 \times 3$) and assume it must be right because "you're meant to multiply by the bottom number."
*   **Basic:** This group usually knows how to "move the 5," making Tom seem obviously correct. However, a very high percentage of these students fall for Katie’s trap. They forget that multiplication must be applied to every term on the left side, not just the fraction. Many will choose C.
*   **Proficient:** These students are more disciplined. They recognize Tom is correct immediately. They are cautious of Katie’s step because they’ve been taught to "clear the fraction" and know that if you multiply by 3, you must multiply the 5. However, some will still be lured by the "logical looking" $x-5=36$.
*   **Advanced:** These students will identify the error in Katie’s working instantly ($3 \times 5 \neq 5$) and confidently select A.
