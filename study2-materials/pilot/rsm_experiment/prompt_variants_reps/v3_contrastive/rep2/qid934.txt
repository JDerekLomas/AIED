As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common student behaviours and the specific structure of the equation $4x + 2y = 10$.

This question is slightly more difficult than standard $y = mx + c$ substitutions because the equation is in implicit form ($ax + by = c$). For the specific value $x=0$, the term $4x$ "disappears," leaving $2y = 10$.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **C (5):** The correct answer. When $x=0$, $2y=10$, so $y=5$.
*   **A (20):** A common "blind operation" error where students multiply the coefficients (4 × 5 or similar) or substitute $x=0$ and somehow end up multiplying everything.
*   **B (3):** A common error where students see "4 and 2" and think the relationship involves adding/subtracting, or they mistakenly solve $4+2y=10$ (forgetting $x=0$ makes that term zero).
*   **D (2.5):** A very common error where students confuse $x$ and $y$ or think they need to divide 10 by 4 instead of by 2.

**Ability Level Predictions:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will guess or be confused by the format of the equation. Option A is a common "high number" guess.
*   **Basic:** Students often struggle with implicit equations. Many will see the '4' and the '10' and perform $10 \div 4 = 2.5$ (Option D) or simply subtract 4 from 10 and then halve it (Option B).
*   **Proficient:** Most should recognise that if $x=0$, then $4x$ is 0. However, some might still rush and pick D by dividing the total by the first coefficient they see.
*   **Advanced:** This is a very straightforward substitution for high-ability students. Almost all will get this right.

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=50% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%
