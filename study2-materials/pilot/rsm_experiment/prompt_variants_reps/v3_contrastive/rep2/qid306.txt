This question addresses two distinct aspects of the order of operations: the "Left-to-Right" rule for addition/subtraction (Problem P) and the priority of multiplication over addition (Problem Q).

The "trap" in Problem P is the mnemonic BIDMAS/BODMAS. Many students incorrectly believe that because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym, they must perform $5+6$ first. This is a very common misconception even among mid-to-high ability students.

In Problem Q, the priority of multiplication ($5 \times 6$) is more widely understood, though lower-ability students still tend to work purely from left to right.

Option B is the correct answer. Option D is the most common "sophisticated error" (applying the BIDMAS acronym too literally). Option A is the "naive error" (calculating everything left to right).

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=50% B=15% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=55% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=2% B=85% C=3% D=10%
