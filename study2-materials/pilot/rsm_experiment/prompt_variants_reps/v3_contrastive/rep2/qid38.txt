As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common algebraic fraction misconceptions seen in GCSE Higher and Foundation tiers.

The common pitfall here is for students to add the numerators ($3+4=7$) and either keep the "more complex" denominator ($2x$) or add the denominators as well ($2x + x = 3x$). The correct path requires scaling the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$ to get $\frac{8}{2x}$, leading to $\frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.

**Key factors:**
1. **Option B (The "Add across" error):** Very common for lower-ability students who apply the same (incorrect) logic they used for numerical fractions to algebra.
2. **Option D (The "Half-scaled" error):** Students recognize the common denominator should be $2x$ but forget to multiply the numerator of the second fraction.
3. **Option A (The Correct Answer):** This requires two distinct steps: finding a common denominator and accurately adjusting the numerator.

Predicting the student performance across ability levels:
