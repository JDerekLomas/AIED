As an experienced UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as a test of two specific areas: integer arithmetic (specifically the multiplication of two negatives) and the ability to distinguish between addition and multiplication when expanding brackets.

The "FOIL" or grid method for expansion is taught extensively, but the most common errors at the **below_basic** level involve "operation confusion," where students add $-1$ and $-4$ to get $-5$, or see the minus signs and assume the result must stay negative. The **proficient** level students occasionally trip up on the sign, choosing $-4$ because they forget that "minus times a minus makes a plus." However, because this is the "Last" term in the expansion and involves small integers, it is generally high-scoring compared to the "Middle" terms where $p$ is involved.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=88% B=7% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
