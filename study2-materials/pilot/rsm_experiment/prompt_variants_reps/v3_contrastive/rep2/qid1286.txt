This question tests a student's ability to rearrange a formula involving a fraction, a constant ($\pi$), and a power ($r^3$). 

While most GCSE students memorize $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, the difficulty lies in the algebraic manipulation. The most common errors involve:
1.  **Inversion error:** Students often multiply by the numerator and divide by the denominator of the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ when rearranging, leading them to Option B.
2.  **Order of Operations:** Students sometimes forget that the cube root must encompass the entire expression, or they struggle to isolate $r^3$ before rooted.
3.  **Variable placement:** Many lower-ability students struggle with where $\pi$ "goes"—whether it's grouped with the 4 or the 3.

Option C is the correct rearrangement. Option B is the most common distractor for students who understand the steps but flip the fraction incorrectly. Option A is chosen by those who think the $V$ is being divided into the formula rather than being the subject.
