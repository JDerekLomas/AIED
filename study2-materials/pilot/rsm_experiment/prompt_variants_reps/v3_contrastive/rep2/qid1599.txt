This question tests a student's ability to translate division into fraction notation, specifically dealing with a binomial divisor. 

**Analysis:**
- **The Core Task:** Recognising that the entire expression after the division sign (the divisor) must go into the denominator.
- **Option A (Correct):** Correctly places $c$ as the numerator and the bracketed expression as the denominator.
- **Option B (The Distractor):** A common error for lower-ability students who feel "c" needs more substance or miscopy the numerator to match the complexity of the denominator.
- **Option C (Order of Operations Error):** This represents a "fragmented" division where the student only divides $c$ by $h$ and leaves the $+4$ trailing. This is a very common mistake for students who ignore the implied grouping of brackets.
- **Option D (The Swapper):** A classic mistake where students put the "largest" part or the "last" part on top, confusing numerator and denominator roles.

Because the brackets are explicitly given in the question, students at the **proficient** and **advanced** levels will find this very straightforward. The main "trap" is for students who do not understand that the fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol, but even then, the visual mapping from $(h+4)$ to the denominator is quite intuitive.
