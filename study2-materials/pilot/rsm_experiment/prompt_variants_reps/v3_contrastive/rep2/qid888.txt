This question is a standard quadratic expansion that tests three specific skills: the FOIL/grid method process, the addition of two negative directed numbers $(-5 - 7)$, and the multiplication of two negative directed numbers $(-5 \times -7)$.

The primary "traps" here are the signs. 
1. **Option B** is the correct answer $(m^2 - 12m + 35)$.
2. **Option D** is a very common error for students who know that $5 \times 7 = 35$ and that there are minus signs in the bracket, but forget that "negative $\times$ negative = positive".
3. **Option A** is the "difference" error, where students subtract 5 from 7 to get 2 instead of summing them to 12.
4. **Option C** is the "sign blindness" error, where students treat everything as a plus.

In my experience, lower-ability students struggle significantly with the multiplication of two negatives (resulting in the $-35$ in Option D), while middle-ability students sometimes mix up the addition/multiplication rules for the middle term.

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=2% B=94% C=1% D=3%
