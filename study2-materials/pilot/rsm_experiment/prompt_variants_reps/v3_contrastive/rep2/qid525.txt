As an experienced UK maths teacher, I’ve analysed this mixed number addition question. This specific problem is interesting because it tests both the addition of fractions with unlike denominators and the ability to follow instructions regarding the format of the answer.

**Key insights:**
1.  **The "Mixed Number" Trap:** Option A ($ \frac{99}{20} $) is mathematically equivalent to the correct answer. However, the question explicitly asks for a "mixed number". Advanced students will read this carefully, while proficient students may see the equivalent value and select it in haste.
2.  **The Common Denominator Error:** Option D ($ 4 \frac{8}{14} $) targets the most common misconception in fraction addition—adding the numerators and denominators ($7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$). This is the dominant distractor for "below basic" and "basic" students.
3.  **Calculation Errors:** Option C represents a confusion in finding a common denominator (often multiplying denominators but failing to adjust numerators correctly, or simply getting lost in the conversion to improper fractions).

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=25% D=45%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
