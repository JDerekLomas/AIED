This question is a classic "fraction trap." While solving $3p = x$ usually feels simple, when $x$ is already a fraction, students frequently default to "multiplication by the numerator" or "multiplication by the whole number" rather than division.

The most common error is **Option A**, where students see 3 and 12 and immediately think of the relationship $12 \div 3 = 4$, leading them to $1/4$. They perform a mental operation that "feels" right with the digits provided rather than following the algebraic step of dividing by 3 (or multiplying the denominator). **Option C** attracts students who ignore the fraction structure entirely and just perform $12 \div 3$, while **Option D** is a rarer mistake involving squaring or confusing the 3 with a square root/power relationship.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=35% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
