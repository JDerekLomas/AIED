As a UK maths teacher, here is the breakdown of how I would expect students to perform on this question.

This question tests the "order of operations" in solving equations. Tom is correct because adding 5 to both sides is a valid first step. Katie is incorrect because if she multiplies by 3, she must multiply **all** terms by 3 (including the -5), which would result in $x - 15 = 36$.

**below_basic:** Students at this level often struggle with inverse operations and will guess "Both" because they assume any manipulation mentioned by two named characters is valid.
**basic:** Many students at this level understand adding 5 is correct but fail to see the flaw in Katie's multiplication (the common error of only multiplying the fraction and the answer, but forgetting the middle term).
**proficient:** Most will correctly identify Tom as being right; however, a significant minority will still fall for Katie's mistake because it "looks" like a shortcut they've seen before.
**advanced:** These students have a solid grasp of balancing equations and will immediately spot that Katie failed to multiply the -5 by 3.

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=50% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=23% D=2%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=5% D=0%
