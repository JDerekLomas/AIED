To find the missing value, we substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$.
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$ (Option C).

Common errors:
- **Option D (2.7):** Mismanaging the negative sign by subtracting 3 from 30 instead of adding ($10x = 27 \rightarrow x = 2.7$).
- **Option A (4.25):** Calculating $x$ if $y$ was something else or swapping the coefficients/incorrect arithmetic ($30 + 12.5$ or similar confusion).
- **Option B (-4.25):** Errors in negative number handling during rearrangement.
