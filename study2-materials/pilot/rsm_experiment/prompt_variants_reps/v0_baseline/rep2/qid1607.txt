In this equation, Isaac correctly multiplies by 4 in Step 1 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). However, in Step 2, he makes a common sign error: instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to get 59, he adds 1 to get 61.

Students at lower ability levels often struggle to identify which specific step is correct if the final answer looks plausible, or they may misidentify the inverse operation required in Step 2. Higher-ability students will quickly spot that $60-1=59$, making Step 2 incorrect.
