To predict the performance, we must look at how students apply the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

**Calculations:**
*   **Left Side:** $8 + 12 \div 4 = 8 + 3 = 11$
*   **Right Side:** $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$
*   **Result:** $11 > 5$ (Option A)

**Common Errors:**
*   **Left-to-right processing (no BIDMAS):** $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$. This leads students to think $5 = 5$ (Option C).
*   **Misinterpreting brackets:** Some lower-ability students ignore the brackets entirely or assume the division applies to the 12 only regardless of the grouping, potentially leading to B or C.
*   **Option D:** Usually selected by students who are guessing or misunderstand inequality symbols.
