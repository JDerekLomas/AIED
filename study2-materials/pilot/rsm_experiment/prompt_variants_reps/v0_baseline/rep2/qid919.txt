In this question, students must navigate the order of operations (indices before multiplication) and the placement of decimal points when squaring.

The correct calculation is $y = 3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

**Common misconceptions:**
*   **Option B (Correct):** $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.
*   **Option D:** Forgetting that $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$ and thinking it is $0.9$. This is the most common error for proficient students.
*   **Option C:** Doing $(3 \times 0.3) \times 2 = 1.8$, multiplying the base by the coefficient and then multiplying by the power instead of squaring.
*   **Option A:** Calculating $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$, effectively doing the multiplication before the index.
