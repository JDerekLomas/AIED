As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common misconceptions regarding the sphere volume formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) and the algebraic steps required to rearrange it.

**Below Basic:** Students at this level often struggle with the fractional coefficient and the cube root. They frequently pick Option A because it contains all the correct symbols but keeps them in a multiplicative relationship rather than applying the inverse operations of division.
**Basic:** Students often perform the first step correctly (multiplying by 3) but then get confused about where $\pi$ and $4$ go. Many pick B, mistakenly thinking $\pi$ stays in the denominator while the 4 remains in the numerator, or simply guessing between the most "maths-looking" fractions.
**Proficient:** These students typically remember the formula correctly and know to multiply by 3 and divide by $4\pi$. Most will arrive at C, though some may make a clerical error in the layout of the fraction.
**Advanced:** High-achieving GCSE (Grade 7-9) or A-Level students should find this a standard rearrangement and should consistently identify C as the correct inverse.

below_basic: A=45% B=25% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
