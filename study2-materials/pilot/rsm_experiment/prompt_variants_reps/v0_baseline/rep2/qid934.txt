As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common misconceptions seen in Key Stage 3 and GCSE foundation/higher tiers.

The question asks for the $y$-value when $x=0$ in the equation $4x + 2y = 10$. Substituting $x=0$ gives $2y = 10$, so $y=5$ (Option C).

**Common Misconceptions:**
*   **A (20):** Students perform $4 \times 0$ but then mistakenly multiply the entire sum by 2 or think they need to multiply 4 by 5 (the result of the constant).
*   **B (3):** This is the "gradient/sequence" error. Students might solve for $x=1$ and get $y=3$, then mistakenly put it in the first box, or simply guess a low integer.
*   **D (2.5):** Students divide the constant (10) by the coefficient of $x$ (4), ignoring the $y$ term entirely ($10 \div 4 = 2.5$).
