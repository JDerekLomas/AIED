As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common misconceptions regarding the rearrangement of the sphere volume formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

Students at the **below_basic** level often struggle with inverse operations, frequently multiplying by the numerator ($4$) rather than the denominator, or forgetting to include $\pi$ in the divisor. Those at the **basic** level often know the formula but make errors in the multi-step algebraic rearrangement, often misplacing $\pi$ (Option B). **Proficient** students usually navigate the algebra correctly but must be careful not to pick a "distractor" that looks similar. **Advanced** students almost universally rearrange the formula correctly to $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$.

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=35% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
