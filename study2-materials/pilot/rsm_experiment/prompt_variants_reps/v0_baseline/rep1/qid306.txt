As an experienced UK teacher, I find that BIDMAS/BODMAS is one of the most consistently misunderstood topics across all ability levels, primarily due to the misconception that Addition (A) must come before Subtraction (S) because of its position in the acronym.

In **Problem P**, weaker students almost invariably choose $5+6$ (Option D or C) because "A comes before S". 
In **Problem Q**, "Below Basic" students often work strictly left-to-right (Option A or C), ignoring the precedence of Multiplication.

Here is the predicted distribution based on typical classroom performance data:

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=55% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=2% B=88% C=0% D=10%
