In this equation, Isaac correctly multiplies both sides by 4 in Step 1 ($15 \times 4 = 60$), which is correct. In Step 2, he is meant to subtract 1 from both sides to isolate $k$ ($60 - 1 = 59$). Instead, he incorrectly adds 1, leading to $k = 61$. Therefore, only Step 1 is correct.

Students at lower ability levels often struggle with inverse operations, frequently performing the same operation seen in the expression (adding 1 because they see a plus sign) rather than the inverse. Higher-ability students typically identify the mistake in Step 2 easily.
