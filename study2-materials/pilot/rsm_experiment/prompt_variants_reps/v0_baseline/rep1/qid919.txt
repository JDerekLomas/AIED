In this question, students must correctly apply the order of operations (indices before multiplication) and navigate decimal multiplication.

The correct calculation is \(3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\).

**Common Misconceptions:**
*   **Option A (0.81):** Students multiply $3 \times 0.3$ first to get $0.9$, then square it $(0.9^2 = 0.81)$. This is the most common error involving BIDMAS/BODMAS.
*   **Option C (1.8):** Students multiply the base by the exponent $(0.3 \times 2 = 0.6)$ then multiply by 3, or simply make a significant doubling error.
*   **Option D (2.7):** A decimal placement error. Students correctly identify $3^3$ or $3 \times 9 = 27$ but place the decimal point as if calculating $3^2 \times 0.3$.
