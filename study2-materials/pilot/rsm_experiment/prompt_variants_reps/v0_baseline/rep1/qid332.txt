As a UK maths teacher, here is my prediction for the student responses based on common misconceptions in algebraic manipulation and "order of operations" logic when solving linear equations.

**Teacher Analysis:**
Tom is correct because he added 5 to both sides ($12+5=17$).
Katie is correct because she multiplied every term by 3 ($x - 15 = 36$). Wait—no, Katie is **incorrect**. She multiplied $x/3$ and $12$ by 3, but failed to multiply the $-5$ by 3. This is the most common mistake students make when "clearing the denominator." Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.

**Percentage Predictions:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with negative numbers and the "balance" method. Many will guess or think both look "mathsy."
*   **Basic:** Many students at this level believe that you can simply "remove" a denominator by multiplying the other side, forgetting to multiply every term in the expression. This leads them to believe Katie is correct.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually recognize Tom's step is correct, but a significant portion will still fall for Katie's "shortcut" error, leading them to choose C.
*   **Advanced:** These students recognize that to multiply by 3, you must distribute it to the $-5$ as well, identifying Katie's error immediately.

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=28% D=2%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=4% D=1%
