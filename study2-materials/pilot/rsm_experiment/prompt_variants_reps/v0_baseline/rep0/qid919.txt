As a UK maths teacher, I analyze this question based on common misconceptions related to Bidmas (order of operations) and squaring decimals.

The correct calculation is $3 \times (0.3^2) = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

*   **Option A (0.81):** Students square the product of $3x$ instead of just $x$, i.e., $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$.
*   **Option B (0.27):** The correct answer.
*   **Option C (1.8):** Students multiply $3 \times 0.3$ and then double it (confusing squaring with multiplying by 2), or do $3^2 \times 0.3 \times 2$. This is a high-error distractor for lower abilities.
*   **Option D (2.7):** Students correctly square $0.3$ but misplace the decimal point as $0.9$ instead of $0.09$, then multiply by 3.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=20% B=65% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=92% C=1% D=2%
