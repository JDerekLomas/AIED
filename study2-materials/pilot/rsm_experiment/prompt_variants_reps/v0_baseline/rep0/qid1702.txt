To find the missing value, we substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$.
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$

The correct answer is **C**. 

Common errors include:
- **Option D (2.7):** Miscalculating the signs ($10x + 3 = 30$, leading to $x = 2.7$).
- **Option A (4.25):** Misidentifying $y$ as $x$ and solving for $y$ ($10(0.5) - 6y = 30$, leading to $-6y = 25$, $y \approx -4.16$, then getting lost in decimals/rounding).
- **Option B (-4.25):** Sign errors combined with substituting into the wrong variable.
