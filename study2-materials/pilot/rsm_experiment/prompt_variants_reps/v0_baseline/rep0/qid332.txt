As a UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common student misconceptions regarding the order of operations when rearranging linear equations involving fractions.

**Tom's method** is the standard "add 5 to both sides" approach ($x/3 = 12 + 5 = 17$), which is mathematically sound. 
**Katie's method** represents a common "multiply by 3" approach, but she has failed to multiply the constant $(-5)$ by 3, which is a frequent error. Only Tom is correct.

**The Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic** students often guess or think any operation applied to the "main" numbers (12 and 3) is valid, often gravitating towards C because they believe there is always more than one way to solve a problem.
*   **Basic** students recognize Tom is right but are easily "tricked" by Katie's $12 \times 3 = 36$, failing to realize the $-5$ must also be scaled. Many will choose C.
*   **Proficient** students usually spot that Katie's multiplication is incomplete (missing the -5), leading them to choose A.
*   **Advanced** students instantly recognise the violation of the distributive property in Katie's logic.

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
