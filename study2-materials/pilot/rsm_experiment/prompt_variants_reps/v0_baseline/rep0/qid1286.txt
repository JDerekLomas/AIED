As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common misconceptions regarding the sphere volume formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) and the algebraic steps required to rearrange it.

**Below Basic:** Students at this level often struggle with the fractional coefficient and the inverse of cubing. They frequently pick Option A because they see all the variables grouped together or Option D because they try to perform operations in an incorrect order.
**Basic:** These students often remember the formula but fail the "cross-multiplication" step of the rearrangement. Many will move the 4 to the top and 3 to the bottom incorrectly (Option B).
**Proficient:** These students generally handle the rearrangement correctly but may make a fleeting error with the placement of $\pi$. They are highly likely to reach the correct answer (Option C).
**Advanced:** These students have mastered subject rearrangement and will quickly identify Option C as the only mathematically sound derivation.

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=35% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=15% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=96% D=1%
