To predict the performance, we must look at the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

**Mathematical Analysis:**
*   **Left Side:** $8 + 12 \div 4 = 8 + 3 = 11$
*   **Right Side:** $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$
*   **Comparison:** $11 > 5$. Therefore, the answer is **A**.

**Student Misconceptions:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often work left-to-right regardless of operators ($8+12=20$, $20\div4=5$), leading them to choose **C**.
*   **Basic:** May recognize brackets but forget division comes before addition on the left side, or vice versa, often guessing between **B** and **C**.
*   **Proficient:** Understand BIDMAS but may make a mechanical error or feel "tricked" by the similarity of the numbers, occasionally picking **C** if they assume both sides must be equal in such a problem.
*   **Advanced:** Will consistently apply rules correctly.
