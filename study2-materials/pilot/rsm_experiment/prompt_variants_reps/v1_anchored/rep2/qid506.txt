In my experience, this specific question is a classic "trap" for students across the middle ability range because it involves dividing a fraction by an integer, which often triggers incorrect mental shortcuts involving multiplication or improper reciprocal use.

**Option A ($1/4$)** is the most common distractor, as students see the 3 and the 12 and perform $12 \div 3$, ignoring the fact that the 12 is in the denominator.
**Option C (4)** is chosen by students who ignore the fraction structure entirely or perform $(3 \times 12) \div 9$ logic.
**Option B ($1/36$)** is the correct answer ($\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$).
