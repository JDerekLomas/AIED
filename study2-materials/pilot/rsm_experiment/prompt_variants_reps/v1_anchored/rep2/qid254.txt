This is a classic "mean including zero" question combined with order of operations (BIDMAS) and calculator entry awareness. 

Option A is mathematically correct as $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15$. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations ($7 \div 5$ happens first). Option C represents the most common conceptual error: ignoring the zero when counting the total number of items ($n$).

Based on my experience in the classroom, here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=2% C=1% D=1%
