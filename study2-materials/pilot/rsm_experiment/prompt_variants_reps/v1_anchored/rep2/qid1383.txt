In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen this exact question trip up many students. The "Advanced" students have the fluency to handle negative bases and even powers automatically. "Proficient" students usually know it's positive but a small portion will miscalculate $3^4$ as 64 or 27 (though those aren't options here) or simply forget the negative sign rule under pressure. "Basic" students often default to $k \times 4$ (leading to 12 or -12) or incorrectly assume a negative base always results in a negative answer. "Below-basic" students are almost entirely split between the additive misconception ($3 \times 4$) and the sign error.

below_basic: A=20% B=35% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=78% B=2% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=0% C=4% D=0%
