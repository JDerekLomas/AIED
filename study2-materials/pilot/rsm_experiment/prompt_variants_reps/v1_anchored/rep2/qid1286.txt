In my experience, this question assesses two distinct skills: recall of the sphere volume formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) and the ability to rearrange a formula involving a cube root and fractions. 

The most common errors occur during the algebraic manipulation. Many students correctly multiply by 3 but then fail to realise that both 4 and $\pi$ must move to the denominator. Option A is a common distractor for those who misplace the $\pi$ in the numerator, while Option D is chosen by those who struggle with the order of operations regarding the cube root.
