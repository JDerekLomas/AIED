In my experience, this is a standard Year 9 or 10 algebra question. The primary pitfalls for students are the addition of negative numbers ($-5 + -7$) and the multiplication of two negatives ($-5 \times -7$). 

Option D is the most common distractor across all middle-ability levels because students correctly sum the middle term but instinctively put a minus sign at the end because the brackets contain minuses. Option A is chosen by students who "find the difference" between 5 and 7 instead of adding them.

basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
