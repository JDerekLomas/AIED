In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen this exact type of BIDMAS (Order of Operations) question catch out students of all levels. 

The Left Hand Side (LHS) is $8 + 3 = 11$. The Right Hand Side (RHS) is $20 \div 4 = 5$. Since $11 > 5$, the correct answer is **A**.

The most common misconception is the "Left-to-Right" error, where students calculate the LHS as $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$, leading them to choose **C**. Lower-ability students often see the same numbers and operators and instinctively assume the answer must be "equal" without calculating.
