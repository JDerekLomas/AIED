In my experience, "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS) contains two very common pitfalls. In Problem P, many students wrongly believe that because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym, they *must* do $5+6$ first. In Problem Q, students with weak conceptual understanding simply read left-to-right ($4+5$ first). Option D is the "Double Error" distractor, while Option B is the correct application of the rules (Left-to-Right for P; Multiplication before Addition for Q).

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=75% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
