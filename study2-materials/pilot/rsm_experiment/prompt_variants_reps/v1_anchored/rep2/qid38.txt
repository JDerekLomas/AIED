In my experience teaching this topic, the main hurdle for students is remembering to find a common denominator rather than just adding across. Option B is the classic "add the tops, add the bottoms" mistake, while Option D comes from adding the numerators but keeping only one of the existing denominators without scaling. Option A is the correct answer, achieved by converting $\frac{4}{x}$ to $\frac{8}{2x}$.
