In my experience, students find linear equations in the form $ax - by = c$ significantly more challenging than the standard $y = mx + c$ format. The inclusion of a decimal ($0.5$) and a negative coefficient for $y$ often triggers sign errors or mistakes in basic arithmetic rearrangement.

Option C is the most common distractor because students often mistakenly substitute $y=0.5$ into $x$ and solve for $y$ ($5 - 6y = 30 \implies -6y = 25$, which doesn't lead to a clean answer, but leads to guessing) or they perform $30 + 3$ (from $6 \times 0.5$) but then divide by 10. Option D is a result of a common sign error ($10x + 3 = 30 \implies 10x = 27$). Option B attracts those who struggle with the order of operations or inverse operations when moving the constant to the other side.

The correct steps ($10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \implies 10x - 3 = 30 \implies 10x = 33 \implies x = 3.3$) are moderately difficult for Basic learners due to the multi-step nature.
