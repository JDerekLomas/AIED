In my 20 years of teaching, I've seen that multiplying directed numbers within the context of expanding brackets is a classic stumbling block. This question specifically targets the "double negative" rule and the common error of adding terms instead of multiplying them.

Below-basic students often see numbers and a sign and default to addition/subtraction rules ($ -1 - 4 = -5 $) or simply guess. Basic students generally know they need to multiply, but the "minus times a minus" rule is inconsistently applied, leading many to $ -4 $. Proficient students usually remember the sign rule but a small margin will still perform the addition error ($ +5 $ or $ -5 $) if they are rushing. Advanced students almost never miss the sign or the operation.

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
