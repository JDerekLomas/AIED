This question tests two distinct concepts: the property of multiplicative inverses (reciprocals) and the rules for multiplying signed numbers. The common pitfall here is "sign confusion"—students know they need to flip the fraction but often forget that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive. To get $-1$, the star must be positive $\frac{4}{3}$.

**below_basic:** A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
(At this level, students often guess. Many will see the negative signs in the question and assume the answer must also be negative, leading them slightly toward B or D. Performance is near chance.)

**basic:** A=40% B=35% C=15% D=10%
(Basic students often recognise that "flipping" the fraction is required to get a 1, narrowing it to A or B. However, many will reflexively pick B because the equation starts with a negative and ends with a negative, failing to realise that $(-) \times (-) = (+)$.)

**proficient:** A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%
(Most proficient students understand the reciprocal property. The main error here is a "slip" regarding the sign, where they mistakenly think they need a negative to "keep the answer negative", but most will correctly identify that $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1$.)

**advanced:** A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
(Advanced students will instantly recognise the requirement for the multiplicative inverse and will not be tripped up by the negative signs.)
