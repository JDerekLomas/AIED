In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen this exact type of question trip up many students because it combines one-step algebra with fractions. 

The most common error is choosing Option A, where students "do the same to the top and bottom" or instinctively think that 3 and 12 relate to 4, leading to $\frac{1}{4}$ (essentially performing $12 \div 3$ rather than $\frac{1}{12} \div 3$). Option C attracts those who ignore the fraction structure entirely, while Option D is a less common error from students who might try to multiply by 3 but apply it to the numerator of the existing fraction.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
