In my experience teaching this across GCSE cohorts, this question tests two main things: the ability to substitute a decimal into a linear equation and the ability to rearrange/solve for $x$. 

The distractors are chosen specifically to catch common errors: 
- **A (Correct):** $10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$
- **B (Negative error):** Many students add $6 \times 0.5$ but then apply a sign error later or subtract it.
- **C (Distractor):** $3.3$ is actually the correct calculation ($33/10$), making it the most attractive distractor if a student makes a small decimal slip or simply sees the number $33$ in their workings.
- **D (Rearranging error):** $10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 27$ (subtracting 3 instead of adding it).

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=48% B=15% C=22% D=15%
proficient: A=78% B=5% C=12% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
