In my experience teaching this topic, students face two main hurdles: the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and squaring decimals. 

The correct calculation is $3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$ (Option B).

Common misconceptions:
- **Option D (2.7):** The most common error. Students multiply $3 \times 0.3$ first to get $0.9$, then square it, or they calculate $3 \times 0.3 \times 3$.
- **Option C (1.8):** Students multiply $3 \times 0.3$ and then mistakenly double it instead of squaring, or they calculate $(3 \times 0.3) \times 2$.
- **Option A (0.81):** Students square the $3$ to get $9$, and square the $0.3$ to get $0.09$, then multiply them ($9 \times 0.09$).
