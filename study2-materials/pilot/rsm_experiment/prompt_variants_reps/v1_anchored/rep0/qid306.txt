In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen that BIDMAS/BODMAS is one of the most persistent areas for misconceptions. The most common pitfall is the belief that addition must always come before subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym, rather than treating them as equal priority from left to right. In Problem Q, almost all students identify the need for multiplication first, but in Problem P, the "Addition before Subtraction" myth leads many to choose D.
