In my 20 years of teaching, I've seen that adding mixed numbers with different denominators is a classic "bridge" topic. Students often fail to find a common denominator or forget to handle the whole numbers correctly. 

**Distractor analysis:**
- **A (99/20):** This is the correct value but expressed as an improper fraction. Many students miss the instruction to leave it as a mixed number.
- **B (4 19/20):** The correct answer.
- **C (99/40):** A common error where students multiply the denominators (10x4) but then fail to adjust numerators correctly or get lost in the conversion.
- **D (4 8/14):** The most common lower-level error: adding the whole numbers, then adding the numerators (7+1) and adding the denominators (10+4).

Here are my predicted percentages based on classroom data:

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
