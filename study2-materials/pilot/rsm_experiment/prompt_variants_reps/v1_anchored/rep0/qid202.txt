As a teacher who has marked thousands of Year 7 and 8 "Number" assessments, here is how I predict students would perform on this specific addition of mixed numbers.

The most common misconceptions for this question are:
1.  **D (Adding the denominators):** This is the classic error where students add $5+5=10$. Even many "basic" level students fall into this trap.
2.  **B (Improper fraction):** This is technically correct in value but fails the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number." High-ability students won't miss this, but mid-range students might think they are being clever by converting.
3.  **C (Adding everything):** Students add the integers for $3$ and then add denominators for $10$, but often lose their way with the numerator.

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=55% B=10% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=82% B=8% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
