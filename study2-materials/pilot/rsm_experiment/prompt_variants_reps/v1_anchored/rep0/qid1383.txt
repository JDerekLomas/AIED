In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen this exact question trip up many students. The main "trap" here is the handling of a negative base with an even index. While many understand that $3^4 = 81$, the application of the negative sign causes significant conflict.

**Below-basic** students often mistake the exponent for a multiplier (doing $3 \times 4$ or $-3 \times 4$) or simply pick the number that looks most familiar from their times tables. **Basic** students often calculate $3^4$ correctly but believe that because the base is negative, the answer must remain negative. **Proficient** students usually know that an even power results in a positive answer, but a small portion will still make a sign error under pressure. **Advanced** students handle this comfortably.

below_basic: A=20% B=35% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=10% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=2% C=22% D=1%
advanced: A=96% B=0% C=4% D=0%
