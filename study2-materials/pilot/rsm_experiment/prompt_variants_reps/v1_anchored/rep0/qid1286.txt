In my experience, this question assesses two distinct skills: recall of the sphere volume formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) and the ability to rearrange a formula involving roots and fractions. 

The most common errors involve "flipping" the fraction $3/4$ incorrectly or failing to recognise that $\pi$ moves to the denominator along with the 4. Option A is a common distractor for students who multiply by the coefficients rather than dividing. Option D reflects a misunderstanding of how the cube root applies to the entire expression.
