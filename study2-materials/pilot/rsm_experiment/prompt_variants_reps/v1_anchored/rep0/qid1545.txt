In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen this exact type of BIDMAS (Order of Operations) question catch out students of all levels. 

The left side simplifies to $8 + 3 = 11$. 
The right side simplifies to $20 \div 4 = 5$. 
Since $11 > 5$, the correct answer is **A**.

The most common error is reading the left side from left to right (calculating $20 \div 4 = 5$), which leads students to choose Option C ($5 = 5$). This "Left-to-Right" misconception is incredibly persistent, especially among basic and below-basic learners who treat a string of numbers like a sentence.

Here is the predicted distribution based on standard UK school data:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
