In this problem, Isaac has performed the first step correctly by multiplying both sides by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). however, in Step 2, he has added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting 1 (obtaining 61 instead of 59). Therefore, only Step 1 is correct (Option A).

Many lower-ability students see "$61 = k$" and work backwards to think "61 minus 1 is 60, 60 divided by 4 is 15," or they simply see two numbers that "look right" and assume both steps must be correct. Advanced students will quickly spot the sign error in the final step.
