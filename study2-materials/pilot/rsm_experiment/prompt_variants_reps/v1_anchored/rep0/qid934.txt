In my experience, this question tests the ability to handle implicit linear equations, which many students find more difficult than equations in the form $y=mx+c$. The star is at $x=0$, making it an exercise in solving $2y=10$, but the presence of the $4x$ and the structure of a "table of values" (usually associated with substitution and plotting) triggers specific common errors.

**Option C (5)** is correct.
**Option A (20)** is a common "operation confusion" error where students see $4$ and $5$ (from $10 \div 2$) and multiply them, or simply miscalculate.
**Option B (3)** is the "slope" distractor; students who think they see a pattern or try to find a value that "fits" often guess small integers.
**Option D (2.5)** is a classic error where students divide 10 by the wrong coefficient (10 ÷ 4).

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=45% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%
