In my experience teaching this specific algebraic structure, the most common error is "intuitive division," where students see the numbers 10 and 5 and automatically perform $10 \div 5 = 2$, ignoring the fact that the variable is in the denominator. Option B is also a strong distractor for students who attempt to "multiply across" incorrectly.

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=45% D=5%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
