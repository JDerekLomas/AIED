In my experience teaching the "FOIL" or grid method for expanding brackets, the most common pitfall for this specific sub-step is the multiplication of two negative numbers. While students can often identify which terms to multiply, the sign error ($ - \times - $) remains a persistent issue through to Year 11.

The distractors C and D are "additive" errors, where students add the numbers rather than multiplying them—a classic mistake when cognitive load is high or the student is working at a below-basic level.

**below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%**
(These students often guess or perform the wrong operation. A significant portion will simply add $-1$ and $-4$ to get $-5$, or forget the double-negative rule entirely.)

**basic: A=45% B=35% C=5% D=15%**
(Basic students know they need to multiply, but the "minus times a minus equals a plus" rule is often inconsistently applied. Many will correctly choose to multiply but end up with $-4$.)

**proficient: A=82% B=15% C=1% D=2%**
(Proficient students are solid on the operation. The main error here is a "silly mistake" regarding the sign, often due to rushing.)

**advanced: A=97% B=2% C=0% D=1%**
(Advanced students almost never miss this. If they do, it is a rare momentary lapse in concentration.)
