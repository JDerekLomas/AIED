This question is a classic "test of understanding" rather than just a calculation. The presence of the zero is the primary distractor for the denominator, while the lack of brackets in Option B tests knowledge of the order of operations (BIDMAS).

**Below-basic (Bottom 25%):** These students often believe that 0 "doesn't count" in a mean calculation and will naturally gravitate toward a denominator of 4. Many will also select B because it "looks" like the steps they perform on a calculator sequentially.
**Basic (Next 35%):** These students know you divide by the number of items, but the zero frequently confuses their choice of denominator. They are highly susceptible to Option C. They often miss the BIDMAS error in Option B.
**Proficient (Next 25%):** Most will recognise that the zero must be included in the count, leadng them to A. Some may still be tempted by the visual simplicity of B, forgetting that without brackets or a fraction bar, only the 7 is being divided.
**Advanced (Top 15%):** These students will immediately spot that A is mathematically equivalent to including the zero in the numerator and will also correctly identify that B is algebraically incorrect due to BIDMAS.

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=12% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=2% C=1% D=1%
