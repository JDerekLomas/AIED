In my experience teaching Key Stage 3 and 4, this specific question highlights a classic struggle with the order of operations (BIDMAS) and place value when squaring decimals. 

The correct calculation is $y = 3(0.3)^2 = 3(0.09) = 0.27$.

Common pitfalls:
- **Distractor B (0.27):** Correct.
- **Distractor A (0.81):** The "common error" where students multiply $3 \times 0.3$ first to get $0.9$, then square it.
- **Distractor D (2.7):** A place value error where students calculate $3 \times 0.3^2$ but treat $0.3^2$ as $0.9$ instead of $0.09$.
- **Distractor C (1.8):** Usually a result of $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$, multiplying by the exponent rather than squaring.
