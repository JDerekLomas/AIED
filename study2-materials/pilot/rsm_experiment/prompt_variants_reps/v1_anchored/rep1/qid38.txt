In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen this specific algebraic fraction question trip up thousands of students. The "same denominator" concept is well-drilled, but students often struggle when one denominator is a multiple of the other.

**Distractor Logic:**
*   **A (Correct):** To add, students must find a common denominator ($2x$). They multiply the second fraction by $2/2$ to get $8/2x$, resulting in $(3+8)/2x = 11/2x$.
*   **B (Add everything):** A classic error where students simply add the numerators ($3+4=7$) and add the denominators ($2x+x=3x$).
*   **C (Incorrect denominator):** Students correctly find the numerator $11$ but think the $x$ "takes over" the $2x$, or they mismanage the LCM.
*   **D (Partial calculation):** Students add the numerators ($3+4=7$) but keep the "larger" denominator ($2x$) without adjusting the numerator of the second fraction.

Here is the predicted distribution based on standard UK GCSE cohorts:

below_basic: A=25% B=40% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
