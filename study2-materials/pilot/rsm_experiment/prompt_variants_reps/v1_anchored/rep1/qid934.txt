To solve this question, a student must substitute $x = 0$ into the equation $4x + 2y = 10$. This results in $4(0) + 2y = 10$, leading to $2y = 10$, so $y = 5$.

Common pitfalls:
*   **A (20):** Students incorrectly multiplying $4 \times 5$ (from the total) or confused by the relationship between coefficients.
*   **B (3):** Miscalculating the linear sequence if they believe $x$ and $y$ must follow a specific pattern of small integers, or making a basic arithmetic error after substituting $x=1$ and mixing up columns.
*   **D (2.5):** Dividing $10$ by $4$ instead of $2$ (getting the $x$-intercept coefficient mixed up).
