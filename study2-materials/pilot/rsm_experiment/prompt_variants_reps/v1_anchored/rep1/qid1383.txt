In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen this exact question trip up even confident students. The primary issue here isn't the calculation ($3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$), but the handling of the negative sign when raised to an even power.

**Below-basic students** often default to multiplication ($3 \times 4$) or assume the negative sign must remain in the answer. They have a high tendency to choose D because it combines both errors.

**Basic students** generally know that powers involve repeated multiplication, but the rule for "a negative times a negative" is often applied inconsistently over four terms. Many will perform $3^4 = 81$ but reflexively keep the negative sign (Option C), a common misconception that $(-3)^4 = -81$.

**Proficient students** are mostly solid on the calculation, but a significant minority will still fall into the "calculator trap" (even in non-calculator contexts, they mentally simulate typing $-3^4$ without brackets, which yields $-81$).

**Advanced students** recognize the even index power and the significance of the negative base immediately.

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=35% D=15%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=22% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
