This question tests a student's ability to rearrange a complex formula involving fractions, powers, and roots. In the UK curriculum, the sphere volume formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) is usually provided or memorized in Year 10/11. The primary challenge here is the algebraic manipulation: multiplying by 3, then dividing by $4\pi$.

The most common error for middle-attaining students is incorrectly grouping the terms during the division phase (Option B) or misremembering the original formula's constants (Option A). Option D is a "nonsense" distractor that tests if students understand that the cube root must apply to the entire expression.
