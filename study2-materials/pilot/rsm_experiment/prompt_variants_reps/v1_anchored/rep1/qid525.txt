In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen addition of mixed numbers cause significant issues, primarily due to the handling of denominators. Option D is the classic "add across" error ($2+2$, $7+1$, $10+4$), which is a magnet for struggling students. Option A represents students who successfully converted to improper fractions but failed to follow the instruction to leave it as a mixed number.
