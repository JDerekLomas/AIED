In this question, students must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the linear equation and solve for $x$. 

The correct calculation is: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$ (Option C).

The most common error for Basic and Proficient students is a sign error during the rearrangement (calculating $10x = 30 - 3 = 27$, leading to $x = 2.7$, Option D). Below-basic students often struggle with the decimal multiplication or perform arbitrary operations, such as adding the coefficients. Option A (4.25) is a distractor for those who might try to divide the constants in an incorrect order or confuse $10x - 6y$ with $10 + 6$.
