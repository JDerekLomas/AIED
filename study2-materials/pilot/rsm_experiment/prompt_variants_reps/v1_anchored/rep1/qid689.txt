In my experience, this specific question is a classic "trap" for students across the ability spectrum because it challenges the intuitive but incorrect assumption that the larger number is always the dividend. Many students see 10 and 5 and reflexively think \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

Here is my predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=23% D=2%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=5% D=0%
