As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this question as a relatively straightforward addition of fractions with the same denominator. However, the constraints (mixed number format) and common misconceptions about adding denominators (Option D) or converting to improper fractions but not back (Option B) are the primary distractors.

**below_basic:** A=45% B=15% C=15% D=25%
*At this level, many students intuitively add the whole numbers and the numerators correctly, making "A" a high-performing guess. However, a significant portion will add the denominators to get "10" (Option D).*

**basic:** A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%
*Basic students are generally taught "add the wholes, add the parts." They are less likely to fall for the improper fraction (B) or the incorrect numerator (C), but the mistake of adding denominators (D) remains a persistent misconception.*

**proficient:** A=85% B=8% C=2% D=5%
*Most proficient students handle same-denominator addition with ease. Those who miss the mark usually do so by either converting to an improper fraction and forgetting to convert back (B) or through a momentary lapse in concentration regarding the denominator.*

**advanced:** A=97% B=2% C=0% D=1%
*Advanced students will find this trivial. The rare errors would stem from misreading the instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number (leading them to B) or a simple clerical slip.*
