In my 20 years of teaching, this specific sub-skill of the FOIL/Grid method—multiplying the constants (the "Last" terms)—is a classic stumbling block. While the multiplication ($1 \times 4$) is simple, the signs provide a significant challenge.

The most common error for basic/proficient students is correctly identifying that they must multiply, but failing the "negative multiplied by a negative" rule (Option B). Below-basic students frequently default to addition (Option D) because they see two numbers with minus signs and intuitively "combine" them.

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
