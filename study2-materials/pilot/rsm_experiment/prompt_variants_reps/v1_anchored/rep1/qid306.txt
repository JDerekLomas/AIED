In my experience, "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS) is one of the most consistently misunderstood topics due to a rigid interpretation of the acronym. Students frequently believe that Addition *must* come before Subtraction because 'A' precedes 'S' in BIDMAS, leading them to choose Option D for Problem P. This "Addition before Subtraction" misconception persists even into GCSE foundation classes.
