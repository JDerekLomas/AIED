In my experience teaching KS3 and GCSE, this specific question is a "classic" trap. Students see the 3 and the 12 and immediately think of the relationship $12 \div 3 = 4$. Those with a weak grasp of inverse operations or fractional division will gravitate toward Option A or C. Even proficient students can slip up by multiplying the denominator by 3 incorrectly or mentally flipping the fraction.

The "Advanced" cohort handles this easily by multiplying both sides by $1/3$, whereas "Below-basic" students often perform a "subtraction" or "division by looking" which leads them to the integer 4 or the more familiar-looking fraction 1/4.

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
