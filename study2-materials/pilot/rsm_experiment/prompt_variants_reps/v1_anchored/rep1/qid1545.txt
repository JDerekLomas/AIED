In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen this exact type of BIDMAS (Order of Operations) question catch out students of all levels. 

The Left-Hand Side (LHS) requires division before addition: $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$.
The Right-Hand Side (RHS) requires the brackets first: $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$.
Since $11 > 5$, the correct answer is **A**.

The most common error is "reading left-to-right" on the LHS, which leads students to think $8+12=20$, then $20 \div 4=5$, resulting in an answer of **C**. This "additive bias" is exceptionally strong in Below-basic and Basic tiers.

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
