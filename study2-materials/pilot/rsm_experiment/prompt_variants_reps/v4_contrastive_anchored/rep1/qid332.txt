In my experience teaching the hierarchy of operations in algebra, this is a classic "order of operations" trap for linear equations. 

**Tom is correct:** He has correctly applied the inverse operation of $-5$ first by adding 5 to both sides.
**Katie is incorrect:** This is the most common error in Year 8 and 9. She has multiplied by 3 but failed to multiply the $-5$ term, effectively calculating $3(\frac{x}{3}) - 5 = 12 \times 3$.

The difficulty here lies in the fact that many students see "multiply by the denominator" as a universal first step, without understanding that the multiplier must apply to every term in the equation.

**below_basic:** A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
At this level, students often guess. B is a very attractive distractor because "getting rid of the fraction" is a strong (but often misapplied) instinct taught in earlier stages.

**basic:** A=35% B=35% C=20% D=10%
Basic students are often split. Half recognize adding 5 is safe (Tom), while the other half see Katie's $12 \times 3 = 36$ as "looking correct" because it follows a common procedural step of clearing denominators, overlooking the necessity of distributing the 3.

**proficient:** A=65% B=15% C=15% D=5%
Proficient students usually recognise that Tom's method is the standard way to solve a two-step equation. Some may still fall for Katie's "quick" method (C) if they have a weak grasp of the distributive property over the entire side of an equation.

**advanced:** A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%
Advanced students will immediately spot that Katie failed to multiply the 5. They are very unlikely to choose B or D. Occasionally, an advanced student overthinks it and considers if Katie's line is *mathematically* possible through a specific sequence, but ultimately they usually land on A.

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=35% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=15% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%
