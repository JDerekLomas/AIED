This question is a classic test of Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), but it contains a very specific trap that catches students across the spectrum: the left-to-right subtraction vs. addition confusion.

The correct path is: $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 + 8$. Many students mistakenly believe Addition must come before Subtraction (because A comes before S in BIDMAS), leading them to calculate $5 + 8 = 13$ and then $3 - 13 = -10$ (Option D). Others will work strictly left-to-right, ignoring the multiplication: $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$ (Option B).

Option A (6) is the correct answer: $3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = 6$.
Option C (-12) is the result of $3 - (5 + 4) \times 2$, a combination of two errors.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=0% D=5%
