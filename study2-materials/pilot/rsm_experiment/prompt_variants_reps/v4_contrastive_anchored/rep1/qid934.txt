In 20 years of teaching, I've seen that students often struggle with equations where the variable they are substituting for (in this case, $x=0$) is "embedded" within a linear expression like $4x + 2y = 10$, rather than the more common $y = mx + c$ format.

The primary pitfall here is the "Coefficient Confusion." When $x=0$, many weaker students simply "ignore" the $4x$ but then fail to divide by the $2$ in front of the $y$, leading them to think $y=10$ (not an option) or perform a different operation. The most common error is picking **C (5)**, as students correctly calculate $2y = 10$ and solve for $y$. However, many students who are guessing or rush will see the numbers 4 and 10 and try to divide them (giving 2.5) or perform $10 \div (4/2)$.

Here is my prediction of the performance breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=65% D=15%
proficient: A=3% B=2% C=90% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=0% C=98% D=1%
