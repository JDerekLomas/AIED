This question is a classic test of the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) combined with decimal arithmetic. Having taught this for two decades, I’ve seen that the primary trap isn't the algebra itself, but the order in which operations are applied.

The most common error (yielding Option A) is the "linear" approach: $(3 \times 0.3)^2$, leading to $0.9^2 = 0.81$. The second most common error (yielding Option D) involves a misunderstanding of place value or "floating decimals" during the squaring process (thinking $0.3^2 = 0.9$, then $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$). Option C comes from forgetting the square altogether and simply doing $3 \times 0.3 \times 2$.

The correct path is $0.3^2 = 0.09$, then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

**Teacher's Insight:**
*   **Below-basic** students will almost exclusively go for C or D because they lack the confidence to square a decimal correctly, often assuming $0.3^2 = 0.6$ or $0.9$.
*   **Basic** students often fall for Option A because they perform the operations as they read them from left to right, ignoring the priority of indices.
*   **Proficient** students usually know to square first but frequently stumble on $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ (the "one decimal place" error), leading them to Option D.
*   **Advanced** students recognise $0.3^2$ as $0.09$ and compute $0.27$ reliably.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=35% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=15% B=55% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=2% B=93% C=1% D=4%
