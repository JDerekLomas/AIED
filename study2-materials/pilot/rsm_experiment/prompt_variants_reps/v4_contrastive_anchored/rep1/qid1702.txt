In my experience, this question is deceptively difficult for students because it involves substituting a decimal value for $y$ rather than $x$, and the resulting equation requires two steps to solve involving negative numbers.

The star represents $x$ when $y = 0.5$. Substituting into the equation gives $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, which simplifies to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, and finally $x = 3.3$. 

The distractors are carefully chosen:
- **3.3 (C)** is the correct answer.
- **2.7 (D)** is the most common error: students do $10x + 3 = 30$, leading to $10x = 27$.
- **4.25 (A)** comes from substituting $0.5$ for $x$ instead of $y$: $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y \approx -4.16$ (students often round or miscalculate this to 4.25).
- **-4.25 (B)** is a variation of the substitution error with sign confusion.
