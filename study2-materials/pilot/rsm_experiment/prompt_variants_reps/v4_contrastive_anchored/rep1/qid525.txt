Having taught this topic countless times, I know that students face two main hurdles here: finding a common denominator (often incorrectly adding the numerators and denominators) and the conversion between improper fractions and mixed numbers.

The specific "trap" in this question is that the correct mathematical value is represented in both improper (Option A) and mixed number (Option B) formats. However, the instruction explicitly asks for a **mixed number**. Lower-ability students will struggle with the calculation, while middle-to-high ability students may find the correct value but potentially fall for the formatting trap.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A ($99/20$):** This is the correct value but the wrong format. This will catch "efficient" students who convert everything to improper fractions first and forget to convert back.
*   **B ($4 \frac{19}{20}$):** The correct answer. 
*   **C ($99/40$):** This represents a failure to understand common denominators (e.g., multiplying denominators $10 \times 4$ but not adjusting numerators correctly, or simply getting the denominator wrong while trying to reach an improper fraction).
*   **D ($4 \frac{8}{14}$):** The classic misconception—adding the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), adding the numerators ($7+1=8$), and adding the denominators ($10+4=14$).

**Predicted Statistics:**
