This specific question is a classic "inverse operation" trap. In my experience, students frequently struggle when the unknown ($p$) is in the denominator. The most common error is for students to assume the operation is $10 \times 5$ (leading to 50) or simply dividing the larger number by the smaller number ($10 \div 5$), which leads them to the incorrect answer of $p=2$. 

The correct answer $p=0.5$ ($5 \div 10$) is counter-intuitive for weaker students who are conditioned to think that division always results in a smaller number or that they should always divide the "big by the small." Option D acts as a distractor for students who become confused by the structure and assume it's an impossible sum.

Here is my prediction for the performance distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=35% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=23% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
