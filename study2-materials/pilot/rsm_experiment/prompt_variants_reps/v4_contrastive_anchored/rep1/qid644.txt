In my experience, this specific question is a "trap" for lower-ability students because it tests a procedural step within a larger process (expanding brackets). While the calculation itself is a basic multiplication of directed numbers $(-1 \times -4)$, the visual of the brackets often triggers an "addition" reflex or a "sign confusion" reflex.

The most common errors here are:
1. **Addition instead of multiplication:** Students see -1 and -4 and perform $-1 - 4 = -5$ or $-1 + -4 = -5$ (Option D).
2. **Sign error:** Multiplying correctly but forgetting that a "minus times a minus makes a plus" (Option B).
3. **Adding magnitude:** Simply adding 1 and 4 to get 5 (Option C).

Advanced students see this as a trivial multiplication. Below-basic students often struggle to isolate the specific multiplication requested from the general "chaos" of expanding brackets.

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=82% B=8% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
