Having taught this topic countless times, I know that this question specifically tests two things: index notation (powers) and the treatment of negative bases. 

The most common error for lower-ability students is to multiply the base by the index ($k \times 4$), leading to options B and D. For middle-to-high ability students, the primary "trap" is the negative sign. Many students remember that $(-3)^2$ is positive but lose their confidence with higher even powers, or they mistakenly believe that because the base is negative, the result must be negative. Calculators also play a role here; if a student types $-3^4$ without brackets, it returns $-81$, which frequently catches out even proficient students.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=20% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=6% D=1%
