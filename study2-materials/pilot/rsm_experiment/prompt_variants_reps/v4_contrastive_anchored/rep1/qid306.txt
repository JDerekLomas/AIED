In my 20 years in the classroom, I have found that BIDMAS/BODMAS is one of the most consistently misunderstood topics. 

The primary trap here is "Addition comes before Subtraction." Many students take the "A" before "S" in BIDMAS literally, leading them to believe they must do $5+6$ first in Problem P. This makes Option D the "clever" wrong answer that catches out even mid-ability students. In Problem Q, while most students recognize that multiplication precedes addition, the "below-basic" group often reverts to the "reading order" (left-to-right) instinct, pulling them toward Options A and C.

The difficulty lies in the fact that Problem P requires left-to-right evaluation (Sub/Add are equal priority), while Problem Q requires order of operations.

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=1% D=7%
