This question tests a student's ability to rearrange a complex formula (changing the subject) where the unknown is involving a power and a fraction. 

In my 20 years of experience, this specific question is a "litmus test" for Higher Tier GCSE readiness. The primary challenge is the multi-step algebraic manipulation required to isolate $r$ from $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. 

The most common errors I see are:
1. **The Multiplier Flip (Distractor A/B):** Students know they need to move the $\frac{4}{3}$ and $\pi$, but they often multiply $V$ by the 4 and the $\pi$ instead of the 3.
2. **The Cube Root Placement (Distractor D):** Students who perform the algebra mentally often fail to realize that the entire expression must be under the cube root, not just the $V$.

**Below-basic** students find this visually overwhelming. They see the $\frac{4}{3}$ in the original formula and often pick an option that "looks" right without any algebraic process.
**Basic** students often get the $3V$ part right (multiplying by the denominator) but frequently misplace the $\pi$ or struggle with the radical sign.
**Proficient** students are usually successful but sometimes fall for "cleaner" looking fractions if they make a slip in their working.
**Advanced** students view this as a standard 2-mark routine manipulation.

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=35% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=96% D=1%
