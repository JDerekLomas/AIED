In my 20 years of teaching, I’ve seen hundreds of variations of this exact problem. This is a classic "inverse operations" trap. 

Step 1 is straightforward (multiplying by 4), and most students will recognize that $15 \times 4 = 60$. However, Step 2 is the "lure." Many students see the $60$ and the $1$, and because they are used to "doing something" with the numbers, they reflexively add them ($60+1=61$) instead of correctly subtracting the 1 ($60-1=59$). 

Below-basic students often see a "mathsy" looking set of steps and assume both are correct because 60 and 61 are consecutive numbers. Basic students will likely check Step 1 and find it correct, but then fall for the common addition error in Step 2. Proficient students usually spot the error in Step 2, but a significant portion will still misread the question or work too quickly. Advanced students will instantly see that Step 2 should be $k=59$.

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=3% D=2%
