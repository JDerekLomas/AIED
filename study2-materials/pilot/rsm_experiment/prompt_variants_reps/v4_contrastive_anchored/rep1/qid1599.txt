As a UK maths teacher, I’ve seen thousands of students transition from the "$\div$" symbol in primary school to the fraction bar notation used at GCSE.

This specific question tests two things: the understanding that a fraction bar represents division, and the "grouping" property of the horizontal bar (which acts as implicit brackets).

**Distractor Analysis:**
*   **A (Correct):** Shows the division clearly with the divisor in the denominator.
*   **B:** A "pattern matching" error. Students who are overwhelmed by algebra often try to balance the expression by adding symbols that weren't there.
*   **C:** A classic BIDMAS/Order of Operations error. Students forget the brackets apply to the whole $(h+4)$ and effectively perform $c \div h + 4$.
*   **D:** The "commutative trap." Many students believe order doesn't matter in division, just as it doesn't in addition ($a+b = b+a$), leading them to put the dividend on the bottom.

**Predicted Performance:**
