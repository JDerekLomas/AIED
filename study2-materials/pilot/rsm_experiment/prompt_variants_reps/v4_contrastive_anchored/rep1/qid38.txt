In my experience teaching this topic, the most common hurdle for students is the visual dissonance between basic fraction addition and algebraic fractions. 

The most common error (leading to Option B) is simply adding the numerators and adding the denominators ($3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$). Option D is another strong distractor for students who recognise the common denominator should involve $2x$, but fail to adjust the second numerator ($3+4=7$ over $2x$). Option A is the correct answer, achieved by scaling the second fraction to $\frac{8}{2x}$.

**Predictive Breakdown:**

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=82% B=8% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=96% B=2% C=0% D=2%
