This question primarily tests the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). The difficulty lies in the structural similarity of the two expressions; a student who fails to apply the rules will likely assume they are equal because they contain the same numbers and operations.

The left-hand side ($8 + 3 = 11$) requires the division to be performed before the addition. The right-hand side ($(20) \div 4 = 5$) requires the brackets to be resolved first.

**Teacher Analysis:**
1.  **The "Equal" Trap (Option C):** This is the most common error. Students with weak conceptual understanding of BIDMAS often assume that since the numbers ($8, 12, 4$) and the operators ($+, \div$) are identical, the result must be the same regardless of formatting.
2.  **Left-to-Right Error:** Below-basic students often process calculations strictly left-to-right. For the LHS, they would calculate $8+12=20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$. Since both sides would then equal $5$, they strongly gravitate toward option C.
3.  **Confusion over Inequalities:** Even students who calculate $11$ and $5$ correctly occasionally mix up the $>$ and $<$ symbols, though this is less common by Key Stage 3 (Years 7-9).

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=2% C=1% D=1%
