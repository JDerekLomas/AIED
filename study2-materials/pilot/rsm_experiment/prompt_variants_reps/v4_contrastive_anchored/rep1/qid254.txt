This question is a classic "process trap." While finding the mean of five small integers is a Grade 3/4 skill, this question specifically tests two potential pitfalls: the treatment of zero in a data set and the correct use of mathematical notation (Order of Operations).

Option A is the mathematically correct process: the zero adds nothing to the sum but must be counted in the divisor. 
Option B is a "calculator trap." Students often type this exact sequence into a scientific calculator without using brackets or the fraction button, leading to an incorrect result ($0+1+3+4+1.4 = 9.4$). 
Option C is the most common misconception: many students believe that zero "doesn't count" and should be ignored when dividing.

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below-basic:** Likely to see that the numbers $1, 3, 4, 7$ are in the numerator of C and assume that because there are 4 non-zero numbers, you divide by 4. They often ignore the 0 entirely.
*   **Basic:** They know there are 5 numbers, but many will be tempted by B because it looks like "adding them up and dividing by how many there are" in a linear format, overlooking the BIDMAS/BODMAS error.
*   **Proficient:** Generally understand the zero must be included in the count, making A the clear winner. A small percentage might still be tempted by the "cleaner" look of C if they are rushing.
*   **Advanced:** Will immediately spot that A is the only mathematically sound expression. They will recognize that B is incorrect due to the order of operations and that C is a conceptual error regarding the value of zero in a set.

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=2% C=1% D=1%
