In my experience teaching expansion of double brackets, this specific question is a "classic" that tests a student's mastery of directed numbers (specifically negative numbers) rather than just the algebraic method.

The key challenges here are:
1. **The Middle Term:** Students must calculate $-5 + -7$. A common error is subtracting the numbers $(7-5)$ to get $-2$, leading to option A.
2. **The Constant Term:** Students must multiply $-5 \times -7$. Many forget that "a negative times a negative is a positive," which leads them to pick option D.
3. **The "Everything is Positive" trap:** Some lower-ability students default to addition for everything once they see two minus signs, leading to option C.

Here is the predicted distribution based on these common classroom pitfalls:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=70% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
