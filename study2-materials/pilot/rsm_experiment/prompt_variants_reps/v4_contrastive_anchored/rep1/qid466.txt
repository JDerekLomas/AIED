As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen this exact type of question trip up students across the spectrum. The difficulty here isn't the fraction arithmetic—it's the interaction between the **negative sign** and the concept of a **multiplicative inverse (reciprocal)**.

Students often remember the "flip the fraction" rule but get muddled on whether the sign flips too. 

*   **A is the classic trap.** Students know they need a positive outcome ($-1 \times ? = -1$ is not the case, they see the negative on the left and a negative on the right and assume they just need to reach '1'). They often believe that a reciprocal must have the opposite sign, confusing it with an additive inverse.
*   **B is the correct answer.** It requires knowing that a negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive, and that a fraction multiplied by its reciprocal equals 1.
*   **C and D** are for students who don't understand reciprocals or are overwhelmed by the notation and just choose a number already present in the question.

Here is my predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=35% B=60% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=5% B=94% C=1% D=0%
