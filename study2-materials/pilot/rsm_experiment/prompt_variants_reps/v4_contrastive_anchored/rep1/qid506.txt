This question is a classic "operation reversal" trap. While it appears to be a simple one-step linear equation, the fractional constant on the right-hand side triggers specific cognitive load issues.

Students frequently struggle with the conceptual leap that "dividing by 3" is the same as "multiplying the denominator by 3". Many students will see the 3 and the 12 and instinctively perform $12 \div 3$ to get 4, leading them to either Option A or Option C. Option A is the strongest distractor because it "looks" like a fraction problem result. Option B is only chosen by those who correctly apply the multiplicative inverse.

**Teacher's Analysis of Distractors:**
*   **A ($1/4$):** The most common error. Students see 3 and 12 and divide 12 by 3, keeping the structure as a fraction.
*   **C ($4$):** Students ignore the fraction structure entirely and just perform $12 \div 3$.
*   **D ($1/9$):** A less common "halucinated" rule where students might square the 3 or misinterpret the relationship between the coefficients.
