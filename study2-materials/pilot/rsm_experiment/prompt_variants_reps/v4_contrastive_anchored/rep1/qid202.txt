In my experience teaching this topic, this is a relatively straightforward addition of mixed numbers because the denominators are the same and the sum of the fractions does not result in an improper fraction. However, there are two primary pitfalls: the "denominator adding" misconception and the "format" requirement.

Option A is the correct answer and is the most intuitive for students who simply add the integers and the numerators.

Option B is the correct numerical value expressed as an improper fraction. Even though the question asks for a mixed number, many middle-attaining students will convert everything to improper fractions first as a "safety" method they've been taught for all fraction addition, then forget to convert back.

Option C and D target the most common misconception in lower sets: adding the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$).

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
