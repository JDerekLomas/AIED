This question tests the ability to rearrange a complex formula involving fractions, powers, and roots. While the sphere volume formula is provided on many GCSE formula sheets, students must first recall it ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) and then manipulate it.

The main challenge here is the multi-step rearrangement. Students often struggle with "undoing" the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ (often incorrectly multiplying by 4 or dividing by 3) and correctly placing $\pi$ in the denominator. 

- **Option C** is the correct answer ($r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$).
- **Option A** is a common error where students multiply all terms together instead of dividing.
- **Option B** is a mistake in fraction manipulation (keeping the 4/3 as 4/3 during the move).
- **Option D** represents a fundamental algebraic error where the cube root is applied before the terms are moved, or partial root application.
