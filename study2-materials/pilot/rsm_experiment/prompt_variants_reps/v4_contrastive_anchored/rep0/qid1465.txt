This question is a classic test of Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), but it contains a very specific trap that catches students across the spectrum: the left-to-right subtraction.

While most students now remember to do the multiplication ($4 \times 2 = 8$) first, the remaining calculation $3 - 5 + 8$ triggers a common misconception. Many students believe "Addition comes before Subtraction" because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS. This leads them to calculate $5 + 8 = 13$ first, and then $3 - 13 = -10$. This is the primary distractor (Option D).

Option A is the correct answer: $3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6$.
Option B represents a total disregard for BIDMAS, working strictly left to right: $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$.
Option C is a variation of the BIDMAS error, usually involving a sign error in the final step.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=35% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=1% D=5%
