In 20 years of teaching, I’ve found that adding mixed numbers with different denominators is a significant hurdle. 

The main trap here is the distinction between "form" and "accuracy." Many students can find the common denominator but struggle to convert their final answer back to a mixed number as requested.

**Option D** is the classic "add the numerators, add the denominators" error ($2+2=4, 7+1=8, 10+4=14$), which is the dominant choice for lower-ability students. 
**Option A** represents students who successfully found the common denominator ($\frac{99}{20}$) but ignored the instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number." 
**Option C** reflects a failure to adjust the numerators when finding a common denominator (often just multiplying denominators to get 40 but keeping the original 7 and 1).

**below_basic:** A=15% B=20% C=25% D=40%
**basic:** A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
**proficient:** A=20% B=75% C=2% D=3%
**advanced:** A=5% B=94% C=0% D=1%
