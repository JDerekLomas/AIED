Having taught this topic for two decades, I have seen thousands of students grapple with the "Multiplicative Inverse" vs. "Negative Reciprocal" confusion. 

This specific question is a classic "sign-trap." While many students understand that to get a magnitude of $1$ they need to flip the fraction, the negative sign on the right-hand side is the filter. 

**Below-basic** students often see the negative in the question and the negative in the answer and assume they need a positive number to "keep things the same" or simply pick the fraction they recognize.
**Basic** students often remember the rule "a negative times a positive is a negative," which leads them correctly to A.
**Proficient** students are actually the ones most likely to trip up on option B; they have just learned about perpendicular gradients (negative reciprocals) in Year 9/10 and often over-complicate the rule, thinking they *always* have to change the sign when flipping a fraction.
**Advanced** students see this as a simple linear equation ($-\frac{3}{4}x = -1$) and solve it without hesitation.

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=55% B=20% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=1% D=0%
