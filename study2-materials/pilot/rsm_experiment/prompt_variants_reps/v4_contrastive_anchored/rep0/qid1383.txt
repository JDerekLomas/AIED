Having taught this topic for two decades, I know that indices combined with negative numbers is a classic "separator" question. 

The primary trap here is the negative base raised to an even power. Students frequently forget that a negative multiplied by itself an even number of times results in a positive. However, for lower-ability students, the even bigger trap is the misconception that an index means "multiply the base by the power" ($3 \times 4 = 12$).

Here is my prediction of the performance breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=35% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=20% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=22% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=0% C=4% D=0%

**Reasoning:**
*   **Below-basic:** Many will perform $3 \times 4 = 12$. Because there is a minus sign in the question, they are highly likely to gravitate towards B or D.
*   **Basic:** These students often know that $3^4 = 81$, but the "even power rule" is shaky. A significant portion will see the negative in the question and instinctively choose a negative answer (C).
*   **Proficient:** Most will correctly calculate 81. The main distractor here is C, as even strong students can be rushed and apply the negative sign to the final result without thinking.
*   **Advanced:** These students have seen this trap many times. They will consciously calculate $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$ and know the result must be positive.
