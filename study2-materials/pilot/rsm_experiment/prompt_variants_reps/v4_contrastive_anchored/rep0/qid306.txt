In my experience, this question highlights the "BIDMAS Paradox." While students are taught that Multiplication comes before Addition (solving Problem Q), the most common misconception in the UK curriculum is that since 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym, Addition must always be performed before Subtraction. This makes Option D a massive "distractor trap" for students who have a superficial understanding of order of operations.

Problem P is the "filter." Proficient and Advanced students know that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and are performed left-to-right. Basic and Below-basic students often think the "A" in BIDMAS means they must do $5+6$ first.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=65% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=93% C=0% D=5%
