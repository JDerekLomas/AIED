In my 20 years of experience, I’ve found that students find linear equations in the form $ax - by = c$ significantly harder than the standard $y = mx + c$, particularly when decimals are involved. 

The most common trap here is a sign error during the rearrangement. To solve $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, students must simplify to $10x - 3 = 30$ and then add 3 to both sides. Many "Basic" and "Proficient" students will mistakenly subtract 3 from 30, leading to $10x = 27$ and $x = 2.7$ (Option D). Others will perform the subtraction correctly but mismanage the decimal division or forget to divide by 10 entirely, though the presence of 3.3 (Option C) is the "correct" pathway: $10x = 33 \rightarrow x = 3.3$. Option A (4.25) is a common distractor for students who confuse the roles of $x$ and $y$ or attempt to find intercepts incorrectly.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=65% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=92% D=5%
