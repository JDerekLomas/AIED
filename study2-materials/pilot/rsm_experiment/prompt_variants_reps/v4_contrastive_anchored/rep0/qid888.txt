In my experience, double bracket expansion with two negative constants is a classic "sign-error trap" for GCSE students. 

While most students understand the FOIL or grid method process, the primary friction point here is the rule "negative times a negative equals a positive." A significant number of students will correctly sum $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12m$, but will then incorrectly calculate $-5 \times -7$ as $-35$.

Option D is the most powerful distractor for mid-attaining students. Option A is chosen by those who struggle with directed number addition (calculating $-5 + 7$ or similar variations). Option C is chosen by those who disregard the negative signs entirely.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=35% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=70% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
