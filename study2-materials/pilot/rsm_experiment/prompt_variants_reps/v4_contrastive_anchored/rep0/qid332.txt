In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen hundreds of students tackle two-step equations involving fractions. This specific question is a classic "balancing vs. distributive" trap. 

Tom's method is the standard approach (adding 5 to both sides), which most students find intuitive. Katie’s method represents a common procedural error: "multiplying everything by the denominator." Students often remember they need to multiply by 3 to "get rid" of the fraction, but they frequently forget that *every* term on both sides must be multiplied. Katie has multiplied $x/3$ and $12$ by 3, but failed to multiply the $-5$, resulting in $x-5=36$ instead of $x-15=36$.

Lower-ability students will often see two different-looking "logical" steps and assume only the most familiar one (Tom's) is correct. Proficient students often fall for Katie's mistake because they recognise the *intent* of clearing the fraction but fail to check the distributive property across the constant term.
