In 20 years of teaching, I've found that students frequently struggle when an equation is not presented in the explicit form ($y = mx + c$). For this specific question, the primary challenge is the implicit form ($4x + 2y = 10$). 

The value to find is the $y$-intercept ($x=0$). This makes the calculation $2y = 10$. However, weaker students often ignore the coefficients or apply incorrect operations. 
- **Option C (5)** is the correct answer ($10 \div 2$).
- **Option A (20)** comes from students who multiply the constant by the coefficient of $y$ ($10 \times 2$) instead of dividing.
- **Option B (3)** is a very common mistake where students assume the table follows a simple pattern (e.g., if $x$ is 0, they try to relate 4, 2, and 10 and guess a small integer) or they subtract $4+2$ from 10.
- **Option D (2.5)** comes from students who confuse the roles of $x$ and $y$ or divide 10 by 4 instead of 2.
