In my 20 years of teaching, I’ve found that students are generally quite comfortable with the "multiplication first" step in a linear equation where the whole numerator is over a denominator. Step 1 ($60 = 1 + k$) is rarely the issue. 

The "trap" in this specific question is the transition from Step 1 to Step 2. Because 60 and 1 are adjacent numbers, a very common error for students working quickly (or those with weak inverse operation skills) is to "add" the 1 to the 60 to get 61, rather than subtracting it. Many students will see $1+k$ and automatically think "I need to do something with that 1," and their brain settles on 61 because it feels like a natural progression from 60.

This question tests the ability to spot an additive error in an algebraic rearrangement. Below-basic students will often see $60$ and $1$ and assume 61 is correct because the numbers "fit." Advanced students will instantly spot the inverse operation error.
