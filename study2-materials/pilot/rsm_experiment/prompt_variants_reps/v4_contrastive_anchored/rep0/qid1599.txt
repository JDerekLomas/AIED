This question tests the transition from arithmetic notation (using the division symbol) to algebraic notation (using the vinculum or fraction bar). While it appears simple, it requires students to understand that the bracketed expression $h+4$ acts as a single entity (denominator) and that the order of the original expression must be preserved.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **A is the correct answer.**
*   **D (The "Inversion" Trap):** This is the most common error. Students often remember that fractions and division are linked but forget that the dividend becomes the numerator. Many see $c$ and then a "big" expression and instinctively put the "big" expression on top.
*   **C (The "Bracket Dropper"):** This is a hierarchy of operations error. Students who don't appreciate that the denominator is a single term will perform $c \div h$ first and then simply add the $4$ to the result.
*   **B (The "Miscopy"):** This is a visual noise error where students subconsciously "balance" the expression by adding $+4$ to the top.
