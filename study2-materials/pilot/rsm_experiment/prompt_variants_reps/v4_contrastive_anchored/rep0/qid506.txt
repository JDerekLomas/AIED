This question is a classic "operation reversal" trap. While it looks like a simple one-step equation, it involves a fraction on the RHS which significantly increases the cognitive load for middle-to-lower-attaining students.

The primary distractor is **A (1/4)**. Students see the 3 and the 12 and immediately think "12 divided by 3 is 4," failing to realize that they are actually dividing 1/12 by 3 (or multiplying the denominator by 3). 

**C (4)** is the choice for students who completely ignore the fractional nature of the 1/12 and simply divide 12 by 3 as if it were a linear equation ($3p = 12$).

**D (1/9)** is a rarer "cross-multiplication" error or a confusion where students might try to square the 3 or apply it incorrectly to the numerator.

**B (1/36)** is the correct answer, requiring the understanding that dividing by 3 is equivalent to multiplying the denominator by 3.
