This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. While it looks simple, it is a significant hurdle for students in Years 7-11. 

The primary trap here is the **larger number divided by the smaller number** heuristic. Most students have a strong intuition that $10 \div 5 = 2$, and they will often force this operation even if it violates the algebraic structure of the equation. Option C ($p=2$) is the most attractive distractor for this reason. Option B ($p=50$) targets students who see 10 and 5 and intuitively multiply them, a common reflex when "moving" a number across an equals sign without regard for inverse operations.

For a student to get Option A ($p=0.5$), they must either correctly rearrange the equation ($10p = 5$, then $p = 5/10$) or possess the numerical fluency to recognize that to get a larger result from a smaller numerator, the denominator must be a decimal between 0 and 1.

**Teacher's Insight:** Even "proficient" students often fall for Option C if they are working quickly, as the brain subconsciously prioritizes "simple integer arithmetic" over "rigorous algebraic manipulation."
