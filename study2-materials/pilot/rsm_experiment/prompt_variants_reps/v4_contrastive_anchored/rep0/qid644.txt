In my experience, this specific question is a classic test of "integer operation" endurance within the context of algebra. By explicitly pointing at the $-1$ and the $-4$, the question removes the difficulty of the "FOIL" or "Grid" method and isolates two specific pitfalls: the multiplication of two negatives and the common mistake of adding rather than multiplying.

Many students in the bottom 50% will see $-1$ and $-4$ and intuitively think "negative 5." The presence of the brackets usually suggests multiplication, but the "basic" and "below-basic" cohorts frequently revert to addition when they see two small negative numbers. Proficient students might rush and forget the "double negative" rule, but they rarely add. Advanced students will find this trivial.

Here is my prediction of the performance distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=15% D=45%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=5% D=40%
proficient: A=82% B=8% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
