This question primarily tests the understanding of the **order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)** and **squaring decimals**.

The key challenge for students is determining whether to multiply by 3 first (obtaining 0.9, then squaring to get 0.81) or square the 0.3 first (obtaining 0.09, then multiplying by 3 to get 0.27). In 20 years of teaching, I've observed that "Square the bracket" or "Power before multiplication" is a frequent stumbling block in algebra.

**Analysis of Distractors:**
*   **A (0.81):** The classic "multiplication before powers" error. $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$. This is the most common misconception.
*   **C (1.8):** Doubling instead of squaring, then multiplying by 3: $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$. 
*   **D (2.7):** Misplacing the decimal point during the calculation (e.g., $3 \times 0.9$ instead of $3 \times 0.09$).
