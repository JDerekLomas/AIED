In my experience, this is a relatively straightforward question that becomes a test of "following instructions" for higher-ability students and a "common operations error" check for lower-ability students. 

The numbers are intentionally friendly: the denominators are the same, and the sum of the fractions does not exceed a whole number, removing the need for "carrying" or renaming. However, the requirement to "leave your answer as a mixed number" is the key discriminator here.

1. **Option A** is the correct mixed number. 
2. **Option B** is numerically correct but is an improper fraction. High-ability students will notice the instruction, but some "Proficient" students might rush, see it is equal, and tick it.
3. **Option C** and **Option D** represent the most common misconception in fraction addition: adding the denominators (5+5=10).

**Teacher's Insight:**
Below-basic students almost instinctively add across the bottom ($5+5=10$), making D a very "sticky" distractor. Proficient students rarely fail the calculation, but about 10-15% will lose a mark by failing to read the specific format requested in the prompt, choosing the first numerically correct value they calculate (often converting to improper fractions as a habit).

below_basic: A=35% B=10% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=82% B=10% C=3% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
