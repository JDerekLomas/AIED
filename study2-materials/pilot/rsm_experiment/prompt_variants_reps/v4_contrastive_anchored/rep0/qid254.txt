This question is a classic "trap" regarding the treatment of zero in data sets and the order of operations. Having taught this for two decades, I’ve seen that the number 0 is the single most common cause of error in mean calculations, followed closely by a lack of brackets when using a calculator.

**Breakdown of the options:**
*   **A (The correct answer):** It includes all numbers (even if 0 is omitted from the numerator, the sum is the same) and correctly divides by the count of 5.
*   **B (The Order of Operations trap):** Many students write this expression exactly as they would type it into a non-scientific calculator. Without brackets, the division only applies to the 7.
*   **C (The "Zero doesn't count" trap):** This is for students who think that because 0 doesn't add value to the sum, it shouldn't be counted in the divisor.
*   **D (The overthinker's trap):** Some advanced students might initially choose this if they are looking for $(0+1+3+4+7) \div 5$ specifically, though most will realise A is equivalent.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=94% B=2% C=2% D=2%
