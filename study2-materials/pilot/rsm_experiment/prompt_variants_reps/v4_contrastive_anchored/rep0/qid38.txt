To predict the performance on this question, we must consider the specific algebraic fraction skills required. 

This is a "medium-difficulty" algebraic fraction question because while the denominators are related (one is a multiple of the other), students frequently default to "cross-multiplying" or adding the numerators and denominators directly.

*   **Option A (Correct):** Requires finding the common denominator of $2x$. Students must realize $\frac{4}{x}$ becomes $\frac{8}{2x}$.
*   **Option B (Add across):** This is the "classic" misconception where students add numerators ($3+4$) and denominators ($2x+x$). This is the strongest distractor for lower-attaining students.
*   **Option C (Numerator error):** Students realize they need a common denominator but either fail to adjust the numerator correctly or incorrectly simplify $\frac{11}{2x}$ to $\frac{11}{x}$.
*   **Option D (The Half-Way Error):** Students recognize the common denominator is $2x$ but forget to multiply the numerator of the second fraction, simply adding $3+4$ over the $2x$ they've chosen.

**Teacher Insight:** At the **Below-basic** level, the "Add across" method (B) is almost instinctive. At the **Basic** level, students know they need a common denominator but often forget to scale the numerator (D). **Proficient** students are usually secure here but may occasionally make a slip. **Advanced** students handle this fluently.

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
