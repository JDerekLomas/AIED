This question primarily tests two things: the correct application of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the ability to square a decimal correctly. 

The most common trap here is the confusion between $(3x)^2$ and $3x^2$. Students who multiply by 3 before squaring will choose **A** $(0.3 \times 3 = 0.9; 0.9^2 = 0.81)$. Another significant hurdle is decimal placement: many students believe $0.3^2$ is $0.9$ rather than $0.09$, which leads them to answer **D** instead of **B**.

**Option Analysis:**
- **A (0.81):** The "BIDMAS" error. Multiplying $3 \times 0.3$ first, then squaring.
- **B (0.27):** The correct answer ($0.3^2 = 0.09$; $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$).
- **C (1.8):** A common confusion where the student doubles the base instead of squaring ($0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$; $0.6 \times 3 = 1.8$).
- **D (2.7):** The decimal placement error. $0.3^2$ is miscalculated as $0.9$, and then $0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$. This is a very "attractive" wrong answer for Basic/Proficient students.

**Predicted Distributions:**
