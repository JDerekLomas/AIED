In my experience, this specific question is a classic "order of operations in reverse" trap. Most students are taught to deal with the constant term first (Tom's method), making Option A a very attractive distractor.

The subtlety here lies in Katie's statement. While it is mathematically possible to multiply the entire equation by 3 first, students frequently forget that *every* term must be multiplied. Katie has failed to multiply the -5 by 3 (which would give $x - 15 = 36$). Only the most observant students—or those who have been explicitly taught "to clear the fraction, multiply everything"—will spot Katie's error. 

Below-basic students often see any mathematical manipulation that "looks" like a valid step as correct, leading them toward C. Proficient students often fall into the trap of thinking "You *can* multiply by 3 first," without checking if Katie actually did it correctly.

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=4% D=2%
