In my experience teaching algebraic fractions, this question is a classic test of whether a student can manage a common denominator when one denominator is a multiple of the other.

**The "Trap":** Many students are taught the "cross-multiplication" or "butterfly" method for fractions. If they apply that here without thinking, they calculate $(3 \times x) + (4 \times 2x) = 3x + 8x = 11x$ for the numerator and $2x \times x = 2x^2$ for the denominator. After cancelling an $x$, they arrive at $\frac{11}{2x}$ (Option A). This is a very common "successful" path to a correct-looking answer that shows a lack of efficiency.

**The Distractors:**
*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** The classic "add the tops, add the bottoms" error. Extremely common at Below-basic and Basic levels.
*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** Adding the numerators but (correctly) identifying the common denominator. This is a common "half-way" error where students forget to scale the second numerator.
*   **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** A rare error, usually a result of incorrect simplification from $11/2x$.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=5% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=1% D=5%
