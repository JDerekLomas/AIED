This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. While it appears simple, it is a significant barrier for students who rely on intuitive "big number divided by small number" mental arithmetic. 

The primary trap here is the "commmutative misconception." Many students will subconsciously flip the division to $10 \div 5$ because they are more comfortable with the integer result, leading them to Option C. Others will treat the $\frac{5}{p}$ as a multiplication problem ($10 \times 5$), leading to Option B. Only students who understand that the variable moves to the numerator on the other side (or that $0.5$ is the reciprocal value needed) will select A.
