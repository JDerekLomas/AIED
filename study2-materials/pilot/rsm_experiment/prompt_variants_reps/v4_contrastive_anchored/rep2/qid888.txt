This specific question tests two distinct skills: the process of expanding double brackets (FOIL/Grid method) and the application of directed number rules (negative multiplication and addition). 

The primary "trap" here is the constant term. Students frequently forget that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive ($+35$), while simultaneously struggling with the linear term ($ -5m - 7m = -12m $). Option D is a very common distractor for students who manage the linear term correctly but slip up on the sign for the constant. Option A is the classic "difference" error, where a student subtracts the 5 from the 7 (or vice versa) to get 2 instead of summing them.
