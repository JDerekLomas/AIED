This question is a classic test of Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). The difficulty lies in the structural similarity of both sides; students who lack confidence in the priority of operations often assume that because the numbers are the same, the values are the same, or they simply work left-to-right.

The left-hand side ($8 + 12 \div 4$) requires division before addition ($8 + 3 = 11$). The right-hand side ($(8 + 12) \div 4$) uses brackets to force the addition first ($20 \div 4 = 5$). Since $11 > 5$, the answer is A.

**Below-basic:** These students struggle with the hierarchy of operations. Many will see the same numbers and symbols and gravitate towards 'C' (equals). Others will work left-to-right on both sides, or simply guess between the inequality symbols without calculating.

**Basic:** This group usually knows BIDMAS exists but often applies it inconsistently. They are highly likely to calculate the right-hand side correctly because of the explicit brackets, but will often work left-to-right on the left-hand side ($8+12=20$, $20 \div 4=5$), leading them to choose 'C'.

**Proficient:** These students generally apply BIDMAS correctly. They will calculate 11 vs 5. A small percentage may have a "lapsing" moment where they misinterpret the inequality symbol or perform a mental arithmetic error under pressure.

**Advanced:** These students will identify the operation priority immediately. They are very unlikely to miss this question, as the arithmetic involved is well within their mental capacity.
