In my 20 years of teaching, I have found that adding mixed numbers with common denominators is one of the more "accessible" fraction topics. However, the specific layout of this question contains two significant hurdles for students. 

First, the "denominators don't stay the same" error is the most prevalent misconception in lower-ability sets; students see the plus sign and instinctively add $5 + 5$ to get $10$. Second, the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number" is a lifeline for some but a trap for others. Option B ($18/5$) is mathematically correct but violates the instruction. For high-achieving students, this is a non-issue, but middle-ability students who prefer converting to improper fractions as a "failsafe" method may select B and ignore the formatting instruction.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=65% B=15% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=88% B=8% C=1% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
