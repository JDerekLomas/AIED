This question is a classic "operation reversal" trap. While it looks like a simple one-step equation, it involves fractions, which significantly increases the cognitive load for middle-attainment students.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **The "Multiply" Trap (A):** The most common error. Students see $3$ and $12$ and their brains immediately go to $12 \div 3 = 4$. Because the $12$ is in the denominator, they place the $4$ in the denominator.
*   **The "Inverse" Error (C):** Students recognize they need to do something with $3$ and $12$, but they perform $12 \div 3$ and ignore the fact that the $12$ was a divisor.
*   **The Correct Method (B):** This requires the student to understand that to undo "multiply by 3," they must "divide by 3" or "multiply by $\frac{1}{3}$." Numerically, $\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{36}$.
*   **The Squared Error (D):** A less common distractor where students mistakenly think they need to square or apply a different operation related to $3^2$.
