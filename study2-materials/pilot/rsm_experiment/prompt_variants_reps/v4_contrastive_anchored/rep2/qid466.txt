To predict the performance on this question, we must consider the interplay between two distinct concepts: **fraction reciprocals** and **the rules of signed numbers (negatives)**.

The primary "trap" here is the sign. Many students recognise that they need the reciprocal to get "1", but they forget that a negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive. Therefore, many students will confidently select A ($4/3$) because they know it's the "flip" but fail to realise that $-3/4 \times 4/3 = -1$. 

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below-basic:** Many see the fraction $3/4$ and either pick its identity ($3/4$) or its negative mirror ($-3/4$). There is little conceptual understanding of the identity element for multiplication.
*   **Basic:** These students often know that a "flip" is involved in getting back to 1. However, they are highly susceptible to the "sign error." They often think "I have a negative, so the answer must be positive to cancel it out" (incorrectly applying addition rules to multiplication) or simply forget the sign of the product must be positive for the result to be negative.
*   **Proficient:** These students rarely pick C or D. The battle is between A and B. A significant portion will still rush and pick A, assuming that "negative times positive stays negative," which is true, but they often miscalculate the specific requirement for the result of $-1$.
*   **Advanced:** These students check their work. They will mentally or scratch-pad $-3/4 \times 4/3$ and see it equals $-1$, confirming A is the correct choice.

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=25% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=6% C=1% D=1%
