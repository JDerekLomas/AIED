In my experience, this question is a classic test of whether a student can handle an equation in the form $ax + by = c$ rather than the standard $y = mx + c$. 

The star replaces the $y$-value when $x=0$. 
- The most common error (Option B) comes from students seeing the '4' and the '10' and trying to do $10 - 4$.
- Option A ($20$) is for those who multiply all the numbers they see ($4 \times 5$ or similar).
- Option D ($2.5$) is a sophisticated error; students divide $10$ by $4$ because they are so used to $x$ being the "multiplier" that they ignore which variable is being zeroed out.
- The correct answer (Option C) comes from $2y = 10$, so $y = 5$.

Below-basic students often struggle with the algebraic notation entirely and will pick A or B based on simple arithmetic "feel". Proficient students almost always get this right, as $x=0$ is the easiest substitution, though some may rush and perform $10 \div 4$.

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=25% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=8% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=97% D=2%
