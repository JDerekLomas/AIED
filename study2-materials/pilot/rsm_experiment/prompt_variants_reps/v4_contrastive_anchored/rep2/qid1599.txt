This question tests the fundamental transition from primary school arithmetic notation (the division symbol) to secondary school algebraic notation (the fraction bar). 

The key difficulty lies in identifying the **scope** of the denominator. Students must recognize that the parentheses $ (h+4) $ bind those terms together, requiring them to stay as a single block underneath the fraction bar. 

**Option D** is the classic "direction" error (inversion), where students assume the larger expression or the second term should go on top. **Option C** is the "omitted bracket" error, where students think the division only applies to the first term encountered. **Option B** is a visual processing error where students "balance" the expression by adding $+4$ to the numerator.

**Teacher's Insight:** Most Proficient and Advanced students will find this trivial, but Below-Basic students often struggle with the visual "translation" of symbols to layout.

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=65% B=5% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=88% B=2% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
