This is a classic "rearranging formulae" question within the context of geometry (Higher Tier GCSE). The primary challenge here isn't calculating a value, but performing the algebraic manipulation correctly—specifically dealing with a fraction ($4/3$) and a cubic term.

The main traps for students are:
1. **The Fraction Reciprocal:** Many students struggle to move the $4/3$. They either multiply the volume by $4$ (leading towards A or B) or fail to recognize that the $3$ moves to the numerator.
2. **Order of Operations:** Students often forget that $\pi$ is part of the coefficient being divided, not part of the root being multiplied.
3. **Visual Similarity:** The options look very similar at a glance, leading to "recognition errors" where a student does the work correctly on paper but picks the wrong letter.

**below_basic:** Students at this level likely don't know the sphere volume formula from memory and struggle to rearrange even simple equations. They will likely guess based on which expression "looks" most like a math formula.
**basic:** These students might recall the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ but will stumble on the first step of the rearrangement. Many will see the $4$ and the $3$ and guess Option A because the $4$ is "on top" in the original formula.
**proficient:** These students know the formula and the steps to rearrange. However, a significant portion will make an algebraic slip (forgetting to divide by $\pi$ or flipping the fraction the wrong way). Option B is a common "half-way there" error.
**advanced:** These students will rearrange the formula $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$ confidently. Errors here are usually due to haste or misreading the options.

below_basic: A=28% B=26% C=22% D=24%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=20% C=60% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
