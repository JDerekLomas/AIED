In 20 years of teaching, I’ve found that mixed number addition often separates students who understand the structure of fractions from those who simply follow a rote (and often misunderstood) procedure.

In this specific question, Option D ($4 \frac{8}{14}$) is the "classic" mistake where students add the whole numbers, then add the numerators and add the denominators. Option A ($ \frac{99}{20} $) is numerically correct but is an improper fraction; the question explicitly asks for a **mixed number**, which will catch out students who convert to improper fractions to calculate but forget to convert back at the end. Option C is a common error involving multiplying denominators.

Here is my predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
