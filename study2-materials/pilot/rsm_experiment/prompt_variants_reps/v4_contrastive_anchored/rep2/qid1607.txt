In my 20 years of teaching, I've seen this specific type of multi-step equation error hundreds of times. This question is a classic "trapped" problem. 

Step 1 is a correct application of inverse operations (multiplying by 4). However, Step 2 contains a "sign reversal" or "operation confusion" error. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to get 59, the student has added 1 to get 61.

Lower-ability students often see $60$ and $1$ and reflexively add them because they don't yet associate the "$+1$" in the equation with needing a "$-1$" inverse. Proficient students will likely spot Step 1 is correct but may rush and see "60... 1... 61" and instinctively tick it as correct without verifying the inverse operation. Only the top-tier students reliably pause to check the arithmetic of the second step.

Here is my predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=40% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=5% D=1%
