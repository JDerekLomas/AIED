Having taught this topic for two decades, I’ve seen that the primary challenge here isn't the arithmetic ($3^4$), but the interaction between a negative base and an even power.

**Key Drivers of Performance:**
1.  **The "Negative × Negative" Rule:** Students often remember that a negative squared is positive, but lose their way with a power of 4.
2.  **The Multiplication Error:** Below-basic and basic students frequently default to $k \times 4$ (leading to 12) rather than $k$ to the power of 4.
3.  **Calculator Syntax (The Trap):** Proficient students who use a calculator often type $-3^4$ without brackets, yielding $-81$. This is the "Subtle Trap" in this question. Even advanced students can fall for this if they are rushing and over-reliant on their Casios without considering the algebraic definition of $k^4$.

Here is my prediction for the distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=40% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=35% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=0% C=8% D=0%
