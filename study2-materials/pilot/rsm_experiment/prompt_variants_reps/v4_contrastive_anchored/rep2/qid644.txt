In my 20 years in the classroom, I’ve seen that students find this specific step of expanding brackets surprisingly difficult because it triggers a conflict between multiplication and addition. 

The most common error is the "operation confusion." Students see the numbers -1 and -4 and, even though they know they are supposed to "expand" (multiply), their brains default to the additive relationship, leading them to $-5$. Among weaker students, the "double negative" rule is also inconsistently applied; they might know $1 \times 4 = 4$ but guess that the answer "should stay negative" because there are minus signs involved.

This question is actually "easier" than a full expansion because it focuses on a single step, but the specific numbers used are designed to trigger the two most common misconceptions in algebra: $ (-1) \times (-4) = -4 $ (sign error) and $ (-1) + (-4) = -5 $ (operation error).

Here is my predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=2% D=13%
advanced: A=96% B=2% C=0% D=2%
