In my twenty years of teaching, I have found that "BIDMAS/BODMAS" is one of the most consistently misunderstood topics. The primary issue isn't the multiplication—most students know that comes before addition. The "trap" is the order of addition and subtraction.

In Problem P, many students (and even some teachers) believe that because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, addition *must* be done before subtraction. They incorrectly group $(5+6)$ and try to subtract it from 4. In reality, addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right. In Problem Q, almost all students from 'Basic' level upwards recognize the multiplication takes precedence.

The most common wrong answer is **D**, driven by the "Addition before Subtraction" misconception.

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=1% D=7%
