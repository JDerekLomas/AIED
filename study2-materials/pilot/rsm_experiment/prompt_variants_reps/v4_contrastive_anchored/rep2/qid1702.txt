In my experience, this question is more difficult than a standard linear substitution because it requires rearranging an equation with two terms on one side and a subtraction sign, rather than just plugging $x$ into a $y = mx + c$ format.

Students often struggle with $6y$ when $y = 0.5$. Many will correctly find $6 \times 0.5 = 3$, but the error occurs in the next step: they may add 3 to 30 (getting 33, then $x=3.3$) or subtract it (getting 27, then $x=2.7$). Option C ($3.3$) is the strongest distractor because students often "default" to addition when moving a term across the equals sign, even if the signs don't warrant it, or simply see the $30$ and the $3$ and combine them intuitively. Option A ($33/10 = 3.3$, but adjusted by students who might perform $30 + (6 \times 0.5 \dots)$ incorrectly or get confused by the $10x$). Option D is the result of $30 - 3 = 27 \div 10$, which is the most common mistake for those who forget to "add" the term that was being subtracted.

Here is my prediction based on 20 years of classroom observation:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=35% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=45% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=75% D=15%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=92% D=5%
