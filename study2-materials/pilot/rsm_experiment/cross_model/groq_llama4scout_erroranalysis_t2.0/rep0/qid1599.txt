## Step 1: Understand the question and the options provided
The question asks to identify the correct algebraic convention for the expression \( c \div(h+4) \). The correct expression should be \( \frac{c}{h+4} \) because in algebra, division by a quantity is represented as a fraction with that quantity in the denominator.

## 2: Identify the common errors for each wrong option
- Option B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \) could result from incorrectly assuming that addition or subtraction operations inside parentheses extend to the numerator.
- Option C: \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \) might be chosen by students who mistakenly consider division by a quantity to mean dividing each term by that quantity or misunderstand the conventions of algebraic expressions.
- Option D: \( \frac{h+4}{c} \) could be selected by those who misunderstand division as requiring the dividend to always be on top.

## 3: Determine which errors are more "attractive" or natural
The most straightforward error are options that mirror common operational mistakes. For example, option B simplifies nicely like a standard fraction operation but neglects the precise convention. Option C reflects a mistake often seen in computation - incorrectly splitting the terms.

## 4: Predict the distribution based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level are likely to exhibit the greatest mistake variety. Without much foundation, errors come from confusion more than systematic understanding.
  - A (correct): Expect a few students here to catch on due to familiarity with fractional expressions, so let's say 30% could chance upon the right formula naturally.
  - B: About 20% might wrongly add inside.
  - C: 30% errors could stem from mishandling operations entirely correctly within common errors range
  - D: Expect 20% to invert numbers haphazardly to an approximately common guess wrong order.

- **Basic Level:** Students begin some patterns but fall for attractive errors systematically (40% A):  A=70%; B=20% 
  Given standard algebraic misunderstanding, let's allocate systematically:
  - Basic allocation error on adding 
  B = >20%
  Operationally split on a wrong pattern common to > some 
## 
  to a systematic understanding they might fall but
 - Thus 
    basic: A=65%, to systematically catch A then B=25%

## Step to assign fractions according the level:  
  students still fall within reasonable ranges systematically


# marking on levels
consider A more probable systematically
given these then likely fractions 
as errors occur

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=65% B=25% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
