## Step 1: Understanding the question and common errors
The question requires students to add two fractions with different denominators: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \). To add these fractions, students need to find a common denominator, which in this case is \(2x\). The correct steps involve converting \( \frac{4}{x} \) to \( \frac{8}{2x} \) and then adding it to \( \frac{3}{2x} \) to get \( \frac{11}{2x} \).

## 2: Identifying potential errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error is adding the numerators and the denominators separately without finding a common denominator, leading to \( \frac{3+4}{2x+x} = \frac{7}{3x} \) (Option B). This method feels natural but is incorrect.
- Another error could be adding the fractions without adjusting for the common denominator properly, such as \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3+4}{2x} = \frac{7}{2x} \) (Option D), which ignores the need to adjust \( \frac{4}{x} \) to have a denominator of \(2x\).
- A less likely but possible error is multiplying both the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the other's denominator and then adding, but this typically leads to more complicated expressions not listed among the choices.

## 3: Estimating student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and may not fully understand the concept of adding fractions with different denominators. They might simply add the numerators and denominators (leading to Option B) or incorrectly manipulate the fractions. Option B (\( \frac{7}{3x} \)) seems likely as it reflects a straightforward but incorrect addition of numerators and denominators. 
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp of algebraic basics but might still make careless mistakes. They are likely to understand the need for a common denominator but may struggle with finding it or simplifying. Option D (\( \frac{7}{2x} \)) is plausible here because it shows an attempt at using a common denominator but fails to correctly adjust one of the fractions.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of finding a common denominator and applying it correctly. They are less likely to fall into the traps that lead to Options B and D and are more likely to choose the correct answer (A: \( \frac{11}{2x} \)).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the algebraic manipulations but are also adept at simplifying expressions. They would likely choose the correct answer (A: \( \frac{11}{2x} \)) without hesitation.

## 4: Assigning percentages
Given the errors and methods described:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some manage to get it right through luck or simple addition), B=50% (simple addition error), C=10% (not directly related to common errors described), D=20% (another straightforward error).
- **Basic**: A=40% (understand the process but may err), B=30% (common error), C=5% (unlikely), D=25% (easy mistake).
- **Proficient**: A=70% (good understanding, likely to get it right), B=15% (occasional mistake), C=5% (rare), D=10% (some errors).
- **Advanced**: A=90% (confident in algebraic manipulations), B=5% (rare mistakes), C=0% (unlikely), D=5% (minor errors).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=50% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
