## Step 1: Analyze the question and the possible calculations
The question requires comparing the values of two expressions: \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\). To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 2: Calculate the first expression
For \(8+12 \div 4\), following BODMAS, we first do the division: \(12 \div 4 = 3\), then the addition: \(8 + 3 = 11\).

## 3: Calculate the second expression
For \((8+12) \div 4\), following BODMAS, we first do the operation in the parentheses: \(8 + 12 = 20\), then the division: \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 4: Compare the expressions
Comparing the two results: \(11\) for the first expression and \(5\) for the second, it's clear that \(11 > 5\). So, the correct symbol to use is \(>\).

## 5: Identify common errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error could be ignoring the order of operations or misapplying it, leading to calculating \(8 + 12 \div 4\) as \(20 \div 4 = 5\) (which would incorrectly suggest \(=, <, \leq\)). Another error could be \(8 + 12 = 20\), then \(20 \div 4 = 5\) and \(5 \div 4 = 1.25\) for the second part, misinterpreting the expressions.
- An attractive wrong method might be to add first in both cases or to mistakenly apply operations from right to left.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with basic arithmetic and the order of operations. They might incorrectly calculate both expressions as \(20 \div 4 = 5\) (thinking both are equal) or simply not understand how to compare them properly. So, they might choose \(C) =\) or not attempt it. \(A=10\%\), \(B=10\%\), \(C=60\%\), \(D=20\%\).
- **Basic:** Basic level students understand the order of operations but might make calculation mistakes. They could calculate the first expression correctly as \(11\) but the second as \(5\), and understand \(11 > 5\), so \(A >\). However, they might still fall for basic misconceptions. \(A=50\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=10\%\).
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand and can apply the order of operations correctly. They should calculate both expressions accurately as \(11\) and \(5\), and choose \(A) >\). \(A=80\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=5\%\).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the order of operations but can also manipulate expressions and understand the relationships between them deeply. They will accurately choose \(A) >\). \(A=95\%\), \(B=0\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=0\%\).
