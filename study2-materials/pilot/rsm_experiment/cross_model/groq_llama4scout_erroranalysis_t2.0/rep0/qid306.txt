To solve this, let's first identify the correct order of operations for each problem and then reason through the common mistakes students might make.

## Step 1: Identify the correct order of operations for each problem.
For Problem P: \( 4-5+6= \), following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), we perform the operations from left to right since there are no parentheses, exponents, or multiplication and division. So, the correct order is \( 4-5+6 \), which means we first do \( 4-5 \).

For Problem Q: \( 4+5 \times 6= \), using the order of operations, we do the multiplication before addition. So, we first calculate \( 5 \times 6 \) and then add 4.

## 2: Analyzing Problem P.
The correct calculation to do first in Problem P is \( 4-5 \). 

## 3: Analyzing Problem Q.
The correct calculation to do first in Problem Q is \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 4: Evaluating the Options.
- The correct answer is B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses Based on Ability Levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level often lack a solid understanding of the order of operations. They might randomly select operations or follow a wrong sequence that seems "easy" or familiar. Option A (\( 4-5 \), \( 4+5 \)) seems plausible because it involves straightforward operations without considering the correct order of operations. Option C (\( 5+6 \), \( 4+5 \)) could also be attractive because it incorrectly applies addition first in both cases. However, given the nature of the question, a significant portion might incorrectly choose A or C due to a lack of understanding.

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make careless mistakes. They are more likely to understand that in Problem P, \( 4-5 \) comes first, but might struggle with Problem Q. Thus, they might lean towards B, but a notable percentage could still choose A due to overlooking the multiplication in Q.

- **Proficient:** These students are likely to understand the order of operations well. They should predominantly choose B as it correctly identifies the first operation in each problem.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, including the order of operations. They are the least likely to make mistakes and should overwhelmingly choose B.

## 6: Assigning Percentages.
Given the above considerations:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (overly simplistic approach), B=20% (some understanding but flawed), C=30% (confusing the operations), D=20% (might seem too complex).
- **Basic:** A=15% (common mistake), B=70% (good understanding but possible error), C=10% (less likely but possible), D=5% (not likely).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (occasional lapses), B=90% (strong understanding), C=3% ( rare mistake), D=2% (unlikely).
- **Advanced:** A=1% (miniscule chance of error), B=95% (strong and accurate), C=2% (very rare), D=2% (extremely rare).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
