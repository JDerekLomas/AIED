## Step 1: Understand the question and the options provided
The question asks to add two mixed numbers: \( 2 \frac{7}{10}+2 \frac{1}{4} \) and to leave the answer as a mixed number. The options provided are \( A: \frac{99}{20} \), \( B: 4 \frac{19}{20} \), \( C: \frac{99}{40} \), \( D: 4 \frac{8}{14} \).

## 2: Identify the correct method for solving the problem
To add these mixed numbers, first convert them into improper fractions: \( 2 \frac{7}{10} = \frac{(2*10)+7}{10} = \frac{27}{10} \) and \( 2 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{(2*4)+1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \). Then find a common denominator, which is 20. Convert both fractions: \( \frac{27}{10} = \frac{27*2}{10*2} = \frac{54}{20} \) and \( \frac{9}{4} = \frac{9*5}{4*5} = \frac{45}{20} \). Add them together: \( \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} \). This can be converted back into a mixed number: \( \frac{99}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20} \).

## 3: Analyze each option for common errors
- Option A: \( \frac{99}{20} \) is the improper fraction result, which is correct but not in the requested mixed number format.
- Option B: \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \) is the correct answer in mixed number format.
- Option C: \( \frac{99}{40} \) seems to result from adding \( \frac{27}{20} + \frac{9}{20} = \frac{36}{20} \) but then mistakenly multiplying numerator and denominator by 2 and adding the fractions with a wrong common denominator or direct multiplication error.
- Option D: \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \) simplifies to \( 4 \frac{4}{7} \), which seems to come from incorrect addition or finding a common denominator.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option
## Step 4.1: below_basic
Students at this level often struggle with basic conversions and operations. They might incorrectly add the whole numbers and fractions separately without finding a common denominator, or make errors in converting between mixed numbers and improper fractions.

## 4.2: basic
Basic level students should be able to perform the operations but might make careless mistakes or not convert correctly.

## 4.3: proficient
Proficient students should be able to solve this problem accurately with minimal errors, understanding the need for a common denominator.

## 4.4: advanced
Advanced students are likely to solve this quickly and accurately, and might be more likely to double-check their work.

## 5: Assign percentages based on likely errors and student understanding
- **below_basic**: These students might struggle to get any correct. Option D seems like a plausible incorrect answer due to misunderstanding of fractions. Option A could be seen as a correct calculation but not in the right format. 
    - A = 10% (some might get the calculation right but not convert), B = 20% (some might convert correctly), C = 15% (an error in finding the common denominator), D = 55% (common incorrect addition or conversion).
- **basic**: Students here would more likely understand the conversion and addition.
    - A = 20%, B = 40%, C = 25%, D = 15%.
- **proficient**: These students understand the process well.
    - A = 10%, B = 60%, C = 20%, D = 10%.
- **advanced**: Highly accurate, with minimal errors.
    - A = 5%, B = 80%, C = 10%, D = 5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
