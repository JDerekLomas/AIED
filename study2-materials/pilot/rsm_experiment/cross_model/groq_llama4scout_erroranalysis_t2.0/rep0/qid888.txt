To approach this, let's first understand the correct method and common errors for expanding the given expression \((m-5)(m-7)\).

The correct expansion is:
\[
(m-5)(m-7) = m(m) + m(-7) - 5(m) - 5(-7)
\]
\[
= m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35
\]
\[
= m^2 - 12m + 35
\]

This corresponds to option B.

## Step 1: Identify Common Errors
- **Option A (\(m^{2}-2m-35\))**: This could result from incorrect expansion, possibly \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35\), but then mistakenly adjusting to \(-2m\) instead of \(-12m\), or simply miscalculation.
- **Option C (\(m^{2}+12m+35\))**: This might come from incorrectly adding the \(m\) terms or mistakenly keeping the signs the same, e.g., \(m^2 + 7m + 5m + 35\).
- **Option D (\(m^{2}-12m-35\))**: This could result from a correct expansion but then incorrectly keeping the \(-5 \times -7\) as \(-35\) instead of \(+35\), or simply skipping the step of adding \(35\).

## 2: Analyze Each Option for Attractiveness and Likely Student Error
- **Basic and Below Basic Levels**: Students here are more prone to making straightforward calculation errors. They might not fully understand the distribution method or might add/subtract incorrectly. Option A seems plausible if students misinterpret the middle term calculation. Option C could be chosen if students incorrectly add the terms without considering the negative signs. Option D might appeal to those who struggle with signs.

## 3: Predicting Percentages
Given the nature of the question:
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to struggle significantly. They might opt for A (20%), B (20%), C (30%), D (30%) because they lack the foundational skills to accurately compute, often leading to wild guessing or applying simple incorrect rules.
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic grasp but are prone to errors. They are more likely to select B (50%) as they attempt the question, but errors lead to A (25%), C (15%), D (10%).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the method but may make minor errors. Thus, B (80%), A (10%), C (5%), D (5%).
- **Advanced**: Students here are familiar with the expansion and less likely to make simple arithmetic errors. So, B (95%), A (3%), C (1%), D (1%).

## 4: Assigning Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- **Basic**: A=25% B=50% C=15% D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=3% B=95% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=50% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=3% B=95% C=1% D=1%
