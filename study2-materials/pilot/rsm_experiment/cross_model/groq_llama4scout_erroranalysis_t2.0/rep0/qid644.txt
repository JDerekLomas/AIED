## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors
The question asks for the product of the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## 2: Identify the wrong options and the calculation errors leading to them
- Option A: \(+4\) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \(-4\) could result from a mistaken application of the rule for multiplying negative numbers, or simply forgetting that two negatives make a positive.
- Option C: \(+5\) does not directly result from a simple multiplication error of \(-1\) and \(-4\), suggesting a more complex mistake or a miscalculation not directly related to the multiplication of \(-1\) and \(-4\).
- Option D: \(-5\) similarly does not directly result from the multiplication error.

## 3: Analyze the errors and student likelyhood of making them
- **Basic and Below Basic students**: These students are more likely to make straightforward calculation errors. For multiplying \(-1\) and \(-4\), an error leading to \(-4\) (B) seems plausible if they forget that two negatives give a positive. Option B (\( -4 \)) seems attractive because it's a simple mistake to make if one forgets the rule about negative times negative.
- **Proficient and Advanced students**: These students are less likely to make basic arithmetic errors but might still fall into traps if they're not fully engaged or if they're rushing.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
- **Below Basic**: Likely to have trouble with the multiplication of negatives. So, \( A = 40\% \) (correct, but possibly due to luck), \( B = 50\% \) (error in multiplying negatives), \( C = 5\% \) and \( D = 5\% \) (random incorrect choices due to lack of understanding).
- **Basic**: Might understand the concept but apply it loosely. So, \( A = 60\% \), \( B = 30\% \) (still some confusion with negatives), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students should mostly get it right. So, \( A = 80\% \), \( B = 15\% \) (occasional lapse), \( C = 2.5\% \), \( D = 2.5\% \).
- **Advanced**: Expected to get it right almost always. So, \( A = 90\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 2.5\% \), \( D = 2.5\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=50% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2.5% D=2.5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=2.5% D=2.5%
