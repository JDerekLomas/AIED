## Step 1: Understanding the question and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\). Isaac's steps are:
Step \(1: 60 = 1 + k\)
Step \(2: 61 = k\)
We need to evaluate if these steps are correct.

## 2: Evaluating Isaac's steps
To solve the equation \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\) correctly:
- Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator: \(15 \times 4 = 1 + k\)
- This simplifies to: \(60 = 1 + k\)
So, Step \(1\) is correct.

## 3: Continuing the evaluation
From Step \(1\), we have \(60 = 1 + k\). To find \(k\):
- Subtract 1 from both sides: \(60 - 1 = k\)
- This simplifies to: \(59 = k\)
So, Step \(2\) (\(61 = k\)) is incorrect because it incorrectly adds 1 to 60 instead of subtracting 1.

## 4: Predicting student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulations. They might see Isaac's steps as correct or not understand how to verify them. Given the nature of the error, they might be attracted to options that seem to validate Isaac's work without fully checking. Expect a high percentage choosing B (Only step \(2\)) or C (Both steps are correct) due to a lack of understanding of algebra. A=10%, B=40%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are likely to recognize that Step \(1\) is correct but might not catch the error in Step \(2\). Expect a significant percentage to choose A (Only step \(1\)), with some still being misled by Step \(2\). A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebra well and are likely to see that Step \(1\) is correct but Step \(2\) is not. They should mostly choose D (Both steps are incorrect) because they understand the mistake in Step \(2\). A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the algebra but are also meticulous. They will easily identify the correctness of Step \(1\) and the incorrectness of Step \(2\). Expect a very high percentage choosing D. A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

## 5: Formatting the predictions
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
- basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
