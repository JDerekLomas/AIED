To approach this question, let's first analyze the common errors that could lead to incorrect answers and assess which calculation error is likely to be made by students at different ability levels.

## Step 1: Identify the Correct Calculation for the Mean
The mean of a set of numbers is calculated by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the count of the numbers. For the given set \(0, 1, 3, 4, 7\), the correct calculation for the mean is \(\frac{0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7}{5}\).

## 2: Analyze Option A
Option A: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) is incorrect because it excludes the 0 from the sum, which is a critical component of calculating the mean.

## 3: Analyze Option B
Option B: \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \) suggests adding the numbers together but then implies division by 5 only for the last number (7), due to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). This would be a common error due to misinterpretation of the order of operations.

## 4: Analyze Option C
Option C: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \) is incorrect because it not only excludes the 0 from the sum but also incorrectly states there are 4 numbers, rather than 5.

## 5: Analyze Option D
Option D: "None of them" would be correct if none of the provided calculations accurately represents the correct method for finding the mean.

## 6: Predict Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of what the mean represents. They might be attracted to options that seem simple or familiar. Option B might appeal due to its simplicity and mistaken application of order of operations. Option A could also be chosen due to oversight of the 0. Option C might be selected due to a general misunderstanding of both summing and counting. Option D seems less likely as these students might not recognize the flaws in the other options comprehensively.

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless errors. They could mistakenly choose Option A for overlooking the 0, Option B for misapplying order of operations, or Option C for incorrect counting and summing. They might start to recognize flaws but could still opt for seemingly straightforward calculations.

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept of mean but might fall into traps if not carefully reading the question. They are less likely to choose Option C due to understanding the need to include all numbers and count them correctly. However, they might still consider Option A or B due to oversight or haste.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a solid grasp of the mean calculation and are less likely to make simple arithmetic or conceptual errors. They would quickly identify the correct formula and are less likely to choose any but the correct option or Option D if they see errors in the others.

## 7: Estimate Percentages
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (simple sum, missed 0), B=40% (misunderstood order of operations), C=20% (misunderstood both sum and count), D=10% (recognize error but unsure).
- **Basic:** A=25%, B=35%, C=15%, D=25% (start to see through simple errors).
- **Proficient:** A=10%, B=15%, C=5%, D=70% (mostly accurate but critically evaluate).
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (accurately identify correct method or lack thereof).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=5% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
