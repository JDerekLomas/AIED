## Step 1: Understand the question and the equation given
The equation provided is $y=3x^{2}$, and we need to find the value of $y$ when $x = 0.3$. The correct calculation is $y = 3 \times (0.3)^{2} = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

## 2: Identify the wrong answers and potential calculation errors
- Option A: $0.81$ could result from $3 \times 0.3^{2}$ if someone incorrectly calculated $0.3^{2}$ as $0.27$ or simply made a calculation mistake.
- Option B: $0.27$ is the correct answer.
- Option C: $1.8$ could result from $3 \times (0.3)^{2}$ if someone calculated it as $3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$, likely due to a mistake in squaring $0.3$.
- Option D: $2.7$ seems to come from a direct multiplication without squaring, $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ then incorrectly stated or calculated.

## 3: Analyze potential calculation errors leading to each wrong answer
- A ($0.81$): Might come from incorrectly calculating $(0.3)^2 = 0.09$ and then multiplying by $9$ (as in $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$ but then somehow getting $0.81$, possibly by mistakenly multiplying by $3$ again).
- B ($0.27$): Correct answer.
- C ($1.8$): Could come from $0.3 \times 3 = 0.9$ then $\times 2 = 1.8$ or similar flawed logic.
- D ($2.7$): Directly multiplying $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ without actually squaring $0.3$.

## 4: Consider which errors are attractive and who might fall into these traps
- Less able students might not understand the squaring operation or multiply incorrectly.
- "Attractive" errors are those that seem like a reasonable step but are wrong, such as directly multiplying without squaring.

## 5: Estimate percentages based on experience
Given typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: These students often lack basic understanding. They might directly multiply (leading to D) or make random errors. So, they might choose D ($2.7$) as it seems a straightforward multiplication, A ($0.81$) due to confusion, and C ($1.8$) from flawed but attemptable calculations.
- **Basic**: These students understand the process but might struggle with decimals and operations. They are likely to make calculation errors leading to A or C.
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to calculate correctly but might slip on decimals. They'd likely choose A if they mess up the calculation significantly.
- **Advanced**: These students have a solid grasp and are less likely to choose incorrect options but human error always exists.

## 6: Predicting percentages based on common mistakes
- **Below Basic**: Often choose obvious wrong answers due to lack of understanding. Given the straightforward nature, D ($2.7$) seems likely as does A ($0.81$) for confusing operations. 
    - A=40% (appeals due to confusion), B=10% (getting it right), C=30% (mix-up in operation), D=20% (simple multiplication).
- **Basic**: Should recognize the equation type, might struggle with accurate calculation.
    - A=25%, B=40%, C=25%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Unlikely to fall into basic trap errors.
    - A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Highly unlikely to make these mistakes.
    - A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
