## Step 1: Understanding the Problems
First, let's analyze the problems given: \( 4-5+6= \) and \( 4+5 \times 6= \). For Problem P, the calculation should follow the order of operations from left to right since the operations are addition and subtraction, which have the same precedence. Therefore, the first calculation should be \( 4-5 \). For Problem Q, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication should be performed before addition, so \( 5 \times 6 \) should be calculated first.

## 2: Identifying Correct Answers
The correct approach for Problem P is to start with \( 4-5 \) because we proceed from left to right for addition and subtraction. For Problem Q, we start with \( 5 \times 6 \) because multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Errors
- A common error for students who are not proficient would be to ignore the order of operations entirely or misunderstand it. This could lead them to choose A for Problem P (incorrectly thinking they should do \( 4-5 \) but mistakenly pairing it with \( 4+5 \) for Problem Q) or C and D, which incorrectly prioritize operations.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level often lack a basic understanding of order of operations. They might choose A (XX% A), thinking to start from the left in both cases without properly applying rules. B (correct identification) would likely be low because they might not understand the rules properly. C and D would likely confuse basic addition/subtraction with multiplication/ addition order.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic (Struggling):** Often doesn't follow any rules systematically. Might pick A=40% (easily confused with performing operations from left to right without applying correct precedence rules), B=20% (some might grasp the subtraction should come first but not multiplication), C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** Some understanding but prone to mistakes. Might choose A=20%, B=60% (starting to grasp or guessing correctly, especially since B matches the correct sequence), C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** Good understanding but can make occasional slips. Likely to choose B=80% as they understand the sequence of operations well, A=5%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced:** Strong understanding. Predominantly chooses B=95%, A=2%, C=2%, D=1%.

## 6: Refining Based on Student Behavior
Given the options:
- Students below basic levels (struggling) are likely to incorrectly sequence and may choose A. 
- Basic and proficient students should largely recognize B as correct because it appropriately sequences both problems according to their operational hierarchy.

## 7: Adjusting and Assuming
Based on general classroom performance data:
- **Below Basic:** A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=90%, C=2%, D=3%
- **Advanced:** A=1%, B=98%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%

Let's respond with percentages.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%
