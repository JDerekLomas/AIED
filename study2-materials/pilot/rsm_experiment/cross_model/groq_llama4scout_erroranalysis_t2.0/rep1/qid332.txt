## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential errors
The question requires students to evaluate two proposed next steps in solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\). Tom suggests \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), and Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\). We need to assess the correctness of each suggestion and predict the percentage of students at different ability levels who would choose each option.

## 2: Evaluate Tom's suggestion
Tom's suggestion is \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). To check if this is a correct next step, we add 5 to both sides of the original equation: \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5\), which simplifies to \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). Therefore, Tom's suggestion is correct.

## 3: Evaluate Katie's suggestion
Katie's suggestion is \(x - 5 = 36\). To check if this is a correct next step, we first multiply every term in the original equation by 3 to clear the fraction: \(x - 15 = 36\). Katie's suggestion seems to misunderstand the operation needed; correctly it should be \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\), indicating Katie's suggestion as presented is incorrect.

## 4: Identify potential calculation errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error for lower-ability students might be not understanding how to isolate \(x\) or misapply operations.
- For Tom's correct step, students who understand adding to both sides to isolate \(\frac{x}{3}\) will choose A.
- For Katie's incorrect step, students might be tempted if they incorrectly multiply the entire equation by 3 but forget to multiply the \(-5\), leading to \(x - 5 = 36\).

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **below_basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the steps to solve an equation and could be easily misled by incorrect manipulations. They might choose B (Only Katie) or D (Neither is correct) due to confusion. A=20% (understanding Tom's correct step), B=30% (mistakenly think Katie's step is correct), C=10% (both), D=40% (neither).
- **basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple arithmetic or conceptual mistakes. A=50% (recognize Tom's correctness), B=25% (incorrectly think Katie's step is valid), C=5% (incorrectly think both are right), D=20% (neither).
- **proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebra and are less likely to make basic errors. A=80% (see Tom's step as correct), B=5% (might mistakenly think Katie), C=5%, D=10%.
- **advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident in their algebraic manipulations. A=95% (easily see Tom's step as correct), B=0%, C=0% (or very low), D=5%.

## 6: Quantify predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20%, B=30%, C=10%, D=40%
- **basic**: A=50%, B=25%, C=5%, D=20%
- **proficient**: A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%
- **advanced**: A=95%, B=0%, C=0%, D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
