## Step 1: Understanding the question and possible errors
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct answer can be found using the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last), which yields \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\). This corresponds to option B.

## 2: Identifying common errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error is to incorrectly apply the FOIL method or to mistakenly add/subtract the terms. For example, \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35\), which corresponds to option D. This error involves correctly multiplying but mistakenly adding the constants.
- Another error could be adding the two constants or incorrectly handling the signs, leading to \(m^2 + 12m + 35\) (option C), which might happen if a student incorrectly adds \(5 \times 7\) and \(m \times (-7) + m \times (-5)\) without properly considering the signs.
- Option A, \(m^2 - 2m - 35\), might result from a student not properly applying the FOIL method, possibly doing \(m \times m - 5 \times 7\) without accounting for the cross terms.

## 3: Analyzing student ability levels and likely errors
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with even the basic algebraic manipulations. They are more likely to make simple arithmetic errors or misunderstand the FOIL method entirely. They might choose option A or D due to confusion with the signs or basic multiplication errors.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebra but might still struggle with more complex expressions. They are likely to attempt the FOIL method but make simple errors, such as option D, where the \(-12m\) is correct but the \(+35\) and \(-35\) are mixed up due to a sign error.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the FOIL method well and are less likely to make simple arithmetic errors. However, they might still fall into the trap of option A if they misremember or misapply parts of the method.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to get the question correct (option B), but if they make mistakes, it could be conceptual errors leading to less common wrong answers or simply careless errors.

## 4: Predicting percentages based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to choose wrong answers due to a lack of understanding. Option A and D might seem attractive due to simple errors. Let's predict: A=30% B=20% C=15% D=35%.
- **Basic**: At this level, students start to grasp the FOIL method but still make errors. Option D seems a likely choice due to mistakes with signs or constants. Let's predict: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%.
- **Proficient**: Students here should mostly choose B but might slip into A or D. Let's predict: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: These students are expected to mostly get it right. Let's predict: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
