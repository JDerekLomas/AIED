## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential errors
The question asks students to multiply the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## 2: Identify the wrong options and the errors leading to them
- Option A: \(+4\) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \(-4\) could result from a calculation error where students forget that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result, so \((-1) \times (-4) = -4\) is incorrect.
- Option C: \(+5\) does not result from a simple multiplication error of \(-1\) and \(-4\), suggesting it might come from a miscalculation or confusion with another part of the expansion.
- Option D: \(-5\) similarly does not directly result from multiplying \(-1\) and \(-4\), indicating a potential error in calculation or confusion.

## 3: Analyze the errors for attractiveness and student likelihood to fall into traps
- The error leading to B (\(-4\)) is straightforward: students who do not apply the rule that two negatives make a positive might choose this.
- Options C (\(+5\)) and D (\(-5\)) seem less directly related to the specific question asked but could result from students misinterpreting the question or making a calculation mistake unrelated to the sign rule.

## 4: Predict percentages based on student ability levels
- **Below_basic**: These students might struggle with basic rules of arithmetic, including the multiplication of negative numbers. They are more likely to make simple errors. Option B (\(-4\)) seems attractive because it results from forgetting the rule about negative times negative. A (\(+4\)) should still be accessible for some. C (\(+5\)) and D (\(-5\)) might result from random errors or attempts to use numbers seen in the question stem. Prediction: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic arithmetic but might still make some careless mistakes. They're likely to know that two negatives make a positive but could get distracted. Prediction: A=60% B=25% C=5% D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students are solid in their understanding of arithmetic operations, including the multiplication of negatives. They are less likely to fall into the trap of B (\(-4\)). Prediction: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the arithmetic but are also less prone to errors due to their confidence and skill level. Prediction: A=90% B=5% C=2.5% D=2.5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=2.5% D=2.5%
