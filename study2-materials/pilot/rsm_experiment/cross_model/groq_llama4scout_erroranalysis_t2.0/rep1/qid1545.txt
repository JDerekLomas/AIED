## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to compare the values of two expressions: $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$. The correct solution involves following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 2: Calculating the Expressions
First, calculate $8+12 \div 4$. Following BODMAS, $12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8 + 3 = 11$.

## 3: Calculating the Second Expression
Next, calculate $(8+12) \div 4$. Following BODMAS, $8+12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.

## 4: Comparing the Expressions
Comparing the two results: $11 > 5$. Therefore, the correct symbol to place in the box is $>$.

## 5: Analyzing Potential Errors
- A common error is to ignore the order of operations or to misapply it. For example, calculating $8 + 12 \div 4$ as $20 \div 4 = 5$ (which is incorrect because it incorrectly groups the numbers).
- Another error could be calculating both expressions as if they were equal or assuming one is always greater without calculation.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often struggle with basic arithmetic operations and the order of operations. They might incorrectly calculate or compare the expressions. Option C ($=$) seems attractive if they incorrectly calculate both sides to the same value or don't calculate at all. Option A ($>$) is correct but requires accurate calculation.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic operations but might still make errors in applying the order of operations. They might choose B ($<$) if they mistakenly think the expressions yield the same or similar small numbers. Option A ($>$) requires understanding and correct application of BODMAS.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations. However, some might still choose C ($=$) or D ($\geq$) if they mistakenly believe the expressions are equal or think about inequalities vaguely. Most should choose A ($>$) if they calculate correctly.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a solid grasp of mathematical concepts, including the order of operations. They are less likely to choose incorrect options unless they misunderstand the question or make a careless mistake.

## 7: Estimating Percentages
Given the calculations:
- The correct answer is A ($>$).
- C ($=$) and D ($\geq$) are incorrect because they suggest equality or a range that doesn't apply.
- B ($<$) is also incorrect.

## 8: Making Predictions
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (some get it right by chance or simple calculation), B=20% (misunderstanding), C=40% (thinking they are equal), D=10% (less likely).
- **Basic**: A=60% (understand the operations), B=20% (some errors), C=15% (some think equal), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (strong understanding), B=10% (careless errors), C=5% (rarely think equal), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=90% (very confident), B=5% (rare errors), C=3% (very rare), D=2% (extremely unlikely).

## 9: Converting to Requested Format
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
