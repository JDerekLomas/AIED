To approach this question, let's analyze the steps given and the common errors students might make.

The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \(k\), the correct steps would involve multiplying both sides by 4 to isolate \(1+k\), and then solving for \(k\).

## Step 1: Correct Step to Solve the Equation
First, multiply both sides by 4: \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \), which simplifies to \( 60 = 1 + k \). This step is correct as it properly isolates \(1+k\).

## Step 2: Solving for \(k\)
Then, subtract 1 from both sides: \( 60 - 1 = k \), which simplifies to \( 59 = k \). This means Step 1 is correct, but Step 2 is incorrect because it states \( 61 = k \) instead of \( 59 = k \).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: Only step 1 is correct. This aligns with the correct analysis.
- Option B: Only step 2 is correct. This is incorrect because Step 2 is wrong.
- Option C: Both steps are correct. This is incorrect because Step 2 is wrong.
- Option D: Both steps are incorrect. This is incorrect because Step 1 is correct.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the algebraic manipulation. They might see Step 1 as a correct multiplication but could be confused by Step 2. A significant portion might choose B or C because they don't fully grasp the algebra, and the error in Step 2 might seem plausible. 
  - A: 20% (recognize the correct step but not necessarily evaluate Step 2 correctly)
  - B: 30% (think Step 2 is correct, possibly due to miscalculation or not checking Step 1 properly)
  - C: 20% (believe both are correct, not realizing the mistake in Step 2)
  - D: 30% (see both as incorrect, possibly due to calculation errors or not understanding)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple arithmetic errors.
  - A: 40% (understand the first step is correct but might not catch the error in Step 2)
  - B: 15% (might incorrectly think Step 2 is an isolated correct step)
  - C: 10% (a few might still not catch the error)
  - D: 35% (recognize both steps' correctness or incorrectness)

- **Proficient**: These students understand algebra well and are less likely to make simple errors.
  - A: 60% (clearly see Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect)
  - B: 5% (unlikely to think only Step 2 is correct)
  - C: 5% (very few would think both are correct)
  - D: 30% (some might recognize both steps' status)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly skilled and less prone to errors.
  - A: 80% (easily identify Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect)
  - B: 2% (rarely would they think only Step 2 is correct)
  - C: 2% (very rarely would they think both are correct)
  - D: 16% (a few might still point out both are incorrect)

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the above analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=40% B=15% C=10% D=35%
- proficient: A=60% B=5% C=5% D=30%
- advanced: A=80% B=2% C=2% D=16%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=60% B=5% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=80% B=2% C=2% D=16%
