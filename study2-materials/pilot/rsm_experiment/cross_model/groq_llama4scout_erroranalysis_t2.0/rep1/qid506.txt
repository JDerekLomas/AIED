## Step 1: Understand the question and common errors
The question requires solving the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) for \(p\). A common error would be not dividing both sides by 3 correctly or misunderstanding fractions.

## 2: Identify specific calculation errors for each wrong answer
- Option A: \(p = \frac{1}{4}\) could result from incorrectly simplifying \(\frac{1}{12} \div 3\) as \(\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\) not being calculated properly, mistakenly thinking \(3 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\) and reverse not giving \(\frac{1}{12}\) directly.
- Option B: \(p = \frac{1}{36}\) is the correct answer from \(\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\).
- Option C: \(p = 4\) could come from \(3p = \frac{1}{12} \Rightarrow p = \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\), then mistakenly reversing, or simply not doing the division properly.
- Option D: \(p = \frac{1}{9}\) might result from misinterpreting the division or fraction operations, possibly thinking \(3 \times \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{3}\) and then mistakenly back-calculating.

## 3: Assess which errors are attractive and likely to occur
- The attractive error for lower ability levels would be not understanding how to divide a fraction by a whole number (leading to A, C, or D).
- For more proficient students, incorrect answers might stem from calculation mistakes or not checking their work.

## 4: Predict percentages based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students may struggle with basic algebra and fraction operations. They might incorrectly do \(p = \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\) (A), or just guess. So, A=40%, B=10%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here understand basic concepts but may make calculation errors. They are likely to get B if careful, but might miscalculate. So, A=20%, B=60%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and are likely to calculate \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{36}\) correctly. Errors might be minimal, so B=80%, A=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: They have a strong grasp and rarely make simple errors. Thus, B=95%, A=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=3% B=95% C=1% D=1%
