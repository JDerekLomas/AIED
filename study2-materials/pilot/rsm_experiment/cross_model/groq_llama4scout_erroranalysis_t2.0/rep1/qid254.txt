To approach this question, let's consider the common errors students might make and how they relate to the calculation of the mean. The mean of a set of numbers is calculated by adding all the numbers together and then dividing by the count of numbers.

## Step 1: Understanding the correct calculation
The correct calculation for the mean of \(0, 1, 3, 4, 7\) is \(\frac{0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7}{5}\). This involves adding all the numbers together and then dividing by the total count of numbers, which is 5.

## 2: Analyzing option A
Option A is \(\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}\). This option incorrectly excludes the 0 from the sum but correctly divides by 5. Students might choose this if they mistakenly ignore the 0, thinking it doesn't contribute to the sum.

## 3: Analyzing option B
Option B is \(0+1+3+4+7 \div 5\). This option incorrectly suggests dividing 7 by 5 before adding the other numbers. Students might choose this if they misunderstand the order of operations or if they incorrectly apply the division before summation.

## 4: Analyzing option C
Option C is \(\frac{1+3+4+7}{4}\). This option incorrectly excludes the 0 from the sum and also divides by 4 instead of 5. Students might choose this if they not only ignore the 0 but also miscount the number of values.

## 5: Analyzing option D
Option D is "None of them". For students to choose this, they must recognize that none of the provided calculations correctly compute the mean.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: These students often struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of mean. They are more likely to make simple addition and division errors. 
  - A: They might choose A if they understand division by 5 is needed but forget to add 0.
  - B: This option might seem correct to them if they don't understand order of operations.
  - C: Likely if they misunderstand both sum and count.
  - D: Unlikely, as they might not recognize the errors.

- **Basic**: These students understand the concept of mean but might make calculation errors.
  - A: A plausible choice if they forget to include 0 in the sum.
  - B: Could be chosen due to misapplication of operations.
  - C: Possible if they misunderstand the count of numbers.
  - D: Some might choose this if they're cautious about their calculations.

- **Proficient**: These students have a good grasp of arithmetic and the concept of mean.
  - A: Less likely, as they should notice 0 is missing.
  - B: Unlikely, as they understand order of operations.
  - C: Unlikely, as they should correctly count numbers.
  - D: Likely, as they can spot errors in other options.

- **Advanced**: These students are confident in their arithmetic and understanding of statistical concepts.
  - A: Unlikely, due to awareness of 0's inclusion.
  - B: Unlikely, due to correct application of operations.
  - C: Unlikely, due to accurate counting.
  - D: Likely, but might double-check calculations.

## 7: Estimating Percentages
Based on typical student errors and understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (forgetting 0), B=40% (wrong operations), C=20% (both errors), D=10%
- **Basic**: A=40%, B=30%, C=20%, D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=20%, B=10%, C=5%, D=65%
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=0%, C=0%, D=95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
