To approach this, let's first analyze the equation and Isaac's steps:

Given \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \)

## Step 1: Correctly solving the equation
To solve for \(k\), we should first multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator:
\( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \)
\( 60 = 1 + k \)

## 2: Isolating \(k\)
Then, subtract 1 from both sides:
\( 60 - 1 = k \)
\( 59 = k \)

## 3: Evaluating Isaac's steps
- Step 1: \( 60 = 1 + k \) is correct based on our calculation.
- Step 2: \( 61 = k \) is incorrect because it incorrectly adds 1 to 60, leading to 61 instead of 59.

## 4: Analyzing possible errors and student responses
- **Step 1 correct, Step 2 incorrect**: This indicates an understanding of the first step but a miscalculation in the second.
- **Both steps incorrect**: This would imply a misunderstanding of the initial step or a calculation error that affects both steps.
- The attractive wrong answer here is likely to be Step 2 being considered correct because students might not recheck their calculations thoroughly.

## 5: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students may struggle with algebraic manipulations and are more likely to make basic calculation errors. They might find both steps incorrect due to a complete misunderstanding of algebraic operations or might incorrectly validate one or both steps.
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic algebra but may make calculation mistakes. They are likely to recognize Step 1 as correct but may incorrectly validate Step 2 due to oversight in calculation.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to accurately solve the equation and identify correct and incorrect steps. They might recognize Step 1 as correct but notice Step 2 is incorrect.
- **Advanced**: These students not only accurately solve the equation but also clearly articulate the correctness of steps. They are less likely to make minor calculation errors and more likely to accurately assess both steps.

Given these considerations:

## 6: Estimation
- **Below Basic**: May not fully understand the process, potentially leading to varied incorrect responses, but likely a higher percentage choosing D (Both steps are incorrect) due to complete misunderstanding.
- **Basic**: Might see A (Only step 1) as a plausible choice because they understand the multiplication step but falter on the subtraction.
- **Proficient**: Would likely choose A (Only step 1) since they understand the multiplication by 4 but see the error in Step 2.
- **Advanced**: Would clearly identify that only Step 1 is correct and Step 2 is not, thus choosing A.

## 7: Specific Predictions
- **below_basic**: A=30% (some understanding of multiplication), B=20% (might see it as a simple addition), C=5% (limited understanding to see both as correct), D=45% (completely off).
- **basic**: A=40% (recognize the first step), B=30% (see the addition error), C=5% (overly optimistic), D=25%.
- **proficient**: A=60% (correct on step 1), B=20% (calculation lapses), C=5%, D=15%.
- **advanced**: A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=5% D=45%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
