## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors
The question requires students to compare the values of two expressions: $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$. To solve this, students need to follow the order of operations (BODMAS/BPEMDAS: Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction).

## 2: Calculate the correct values of the expressions
First, calculate $8+12 \div 4$. Following BODMAS, $12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8 + 3 = 11$.

Next, calculate $(8+12) \div 4$. Following BODMAS, $8+12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.

## 3: Compare the expressions and determine the correct symbol
Since $11 > 5$, the correct symbol to use is $>$.

## 4: Identify common errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error would be to ignore BODMAS and perform operations from left to right or incorrectly, leading to $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$ for the first expression (which is incorrect because it misinterprets the order of operations), or simply adding and then dividing without brackets: $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$ and $8 + (12 \div 4) = 11$. 
- Another error could be assuming the expressions are equal or less than/greater than without calculation.

## 5: Determine the error rates for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand BODMAS or might add and divide in any order. They might choose $C = $ (believing the expressions are equal due to a lack of understanding) or randomly select an option. Given the simplistic nature of the question, mistakes here are more about not following rules than applying wrong rules.

## 6: Predicting percentages
- **Below Basic** (let's assume around 15-20% of the cohort): These students might struggle with the concept of BODMAS. 
    - A ($>$): 10% (those who managed to calculate or guess)
    - B ($<$): 10% (similar, guess or simple miscalculation)
    - C ($=$): 60% (equating due to lack of understanding of operations)
    - D ($\geq$): 20% (includes students who picked a 'safe' option or misunderstood)

- **Basic** (around 40-50%): These students should have some grasp of BODMAS but might make calculation errors.
    - A ($>$): 40% (those who understand the operations order, approximately)
    - B ($<$): 20% (made simple mistakes, e.g., misunderstood division and addition order)
    - C ($=$): 25% (thought they were equal, which indicates some order of operations misunderstanding)
    - D ($\geq$): 15% (picked due to margin of error understanding)

- **Proficient** (around 25-35%): These students have a good understanding but might slip on occasion.
    - A ($>$): 80% (calculate both expressions correctly)
    - B ($<$): 5% (an occasional mistake due to miscalculation)
    - C ($=$): 10% (mistake indicating partial understanding)
    - D ($\geq$): 5% (likely an odd guess)

- **Advanced** (around 5-10%): These students typically do not make errors in understanding or applying BODMAS.
    - A ($>$): 95% (easily see $11 > 5$)
    - B ($<$): 0% (unlikely to think $5 > 11$ )
    - C ($=$): 3% (highly unusual mistake for this group, indicating exceptional mathematical skill does not preclude occasional simple oversight)
    - D ($\geq$): 2% (similar to C, extremely rare)

## 7: Translating to response format
- given variations by level but approximating to sensible estimation based on the likely understanding:
  below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
  basic: A=40% B=20% C=25% D=15%
  proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
  advanced: A=95% B=0% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=3% D=2%
