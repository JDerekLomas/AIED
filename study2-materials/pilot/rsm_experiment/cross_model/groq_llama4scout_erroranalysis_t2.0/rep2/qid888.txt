## Step 1: Understand the question and the possible answers
The question asks students to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). To solve this, students should use the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) or the distributive property twice. The correct expansion is \(m(m) + m(-7) - 5(m) -5(-7)\) which simplifies to \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 2: Identify the correct answer
The correct answer, based on the calculation, is \(m^2 - 12m + 35\), which corresponds to option B.

## 3: Analyze option A
Option A is \(m^2 - 2m - 35\). This could result from a calculation error where students incorrectly apply the FOIL method, getting \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35\) seems to be a plausible mistake but let's see. Actually, a common error for A could be \(m^2 - 5m - 7m + 35\) which gives \(m^2 - 12m + 35\), no, actually A suggests a mistake in combining like terms or initial steps.

## 4: Analyze option C
Option C, \(m^2 + 12m + 35\), could come from a mistake where students add the \(m\) terms instead of subtracting or adding them correctly. The error might look like: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 -35 + (7*5)m\), which does not align directly; rather, an error where both products of numbers are added: \((-5)*(-7) = + 35\) but if mistakenly \(-7m + 5m\), no, does not match.

## 5: Analyze option D
Option D, \(m^2 - 12m - 35\), seems to arise from not adding the \(35\) from \((-5)*(-7)\); rather students might compute \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35\), not realizing the double negative yields a plus.

## 6: Consider common student mistakes
- A students might get by not combining the middle terms properly or reversing the multiplication effectively giving another chance of calculation misstep yielding \(-2m\).
- B seems right by the distribution method which many should hit if precise 
- C: If \(m*m + -7m + M*-5\) combined errors yield misaligned factors wrong expansion steps
- D comes likely if step combine wrongly mislay subtracting  product.

## 7: Allocate percentages based on experience
Recall typical algebraic expansions; more to B by accuracy
Thus by typical teaching standard attainment, typical mistakes occur.

## 8: Mark Distribution Across Levels
Below Basic: Expect massive amount error to go trap A B less 
Basic might lean option more B and lower grades fall
Standard might push up rate of 

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
