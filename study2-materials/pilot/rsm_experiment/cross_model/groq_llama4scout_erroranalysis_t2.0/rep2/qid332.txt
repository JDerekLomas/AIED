## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks to predict the percentage of students at different ability levels (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who chose each option (A, B, C, D) for a given math problem. The problem involves solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) and evaluating the correctness of two proposed next lines of working.

## 2: Identifying Correct and Incorrect Options
Tom's proposed next line of working is \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), which is correct because adding 5 to both sides of the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) yields \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). Katie's proposed next line of working is \(x - 5 = 36\), which is incorrect because multiplying both sides of the original equation by 3 gives \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\). Therefore, the correct answer is A) Only Tom.

## 3: Analyzing Calculation Errors and Attractive Mistakes
- The calculation error leading to Katie's wrong answer involves a misunderstanding of the operations needed to isolate \(x\). Multiplying the entire equation by 3 to clear the fraction is a common and correct step, but Katie incorrectly applied it as \(x - 5 = 36\) instead of \(x - 15 = 36\).
- Tom's method is straightforward and less prone to error, as it directly addresses the isolation of \(\frac{x}{3}\).

## 4: Assessing Student Understanding by Ability Level
- **Below_Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly validate Katie's method due to a lack of understanding of how to properly manipulate the equation or might not recognize Tom's method as correct.
- **Basic**: Basic level students should have a grasp of simple algebra. They are likely to recognize Tom's method as correct. Katie's mistake might seem plausible to them if they haven't fully grasped the concept of clearing fractions in equations.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand algebra well and are likely to see both methods' validity or lack thereof clearly. They will recognize Tom's correctness and Katie's mistake.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students have a deep understanding and will easily see Tom's method as correct and Katie's as incorrect.

## 5: Predicting Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below_Basic**: Many might choose B (Only Katie) or D (Neither is correct) due to confusion. A=20% (recognize Tom's correctness), B=40% (mistakenly think Katie is correct), C=10% (both are correct, which is not possible), D=30% (neither, due to confusion).
- **Basic**: A=60% (recognize Tom), B=30% (Katie seems plausible), C=5% (both), D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=80% (clearly see Tom's method), B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.

## 6: Final Predictions
Based on typical student performance:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
- **basic**: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
