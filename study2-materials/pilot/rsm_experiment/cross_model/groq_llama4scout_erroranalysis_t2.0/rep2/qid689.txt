## Step 1: Understand the question and common errors
To solve the equation \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\), students need to isolate \(p\). The correct method involves multiplying both sides by \(p\) to get \(10p = 5\), and then dividing both sides by 10 to get \(p = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5\).

## 2: Identify calculation errors leading to wrong answers
- Option A: \(p = 0.5\) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \(p = 50\) could result from incorrectly manipulating the equation, such as \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\) becoming \(10p = 5 \times p\) (correct to here) then \(10 = 5p\) (incorrectly dividing both sides by \(p\) instead of \(5\), a plausible mistake), leading to \(p = 2\) (not an option provided, indicating a potential miscalculation). The actual mistake might be \(10p = 500\) (from \(10 \times 50 = 500\)) leading to \(p = 50\), implying students might confuse operations.
- Option C: \(p = 2\) could result from solving \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\) as \(10p = 5\), leading to \(p = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5\), but if a student incorrectly calculates or uses wrong operations, they might get \(p = 2\).
- Option D: "There are no solutions" might be chosen by students who attempt to solve it inappropriately or recognize an error they've made but cannot rectify.

## 3: Evaluate the attractiveness of wrong methods and student vigilance
- Attractive mistakes often involve not isolating the variable correctly or misinterpreting operations. For \(p = 50\), if a student solves it as \(5 = 10p\), they'd get \(p = 0.5\), indicating confusion. For \(p = 2\), the mistake could be inversion or operation errors.
- Typically, "below basic" students might select \(p = 2\) or \(p = 50\) due to not fully understanding variable isolation or inverse operations. 
- "Basic" and "proficient" students should mostly select A but might have an error rate for B or C based on arithmetic slip-ups.

## 4: Estimate the percentages based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Might get 20% A (they get it right by chance or basic fluency), 30% B (attractive error through multiplication confusion), 30% C (another form of confusion perhaps less intuitive), and 20% D (because they do not comprehend basic equations).
- **Basic**: Should start to show a higher competence; therefore, around 60% A, 20% B, 15% C, and 5% D.
- **Proficient**: Mostly understands algebra; hence, around 80% A, 15% B (possibly slips into errors they typically wouldn't), 5% C, and minimal D.
- **Advanced**: Clearly, around 95% A, nearly no one chooses incorrect options (B or C < 3%, D minimal).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=5% D=0%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=2% D=0%
