## Step 1: Understand the question and the equation given
The equation provided is $y = 3x^{2}$, and we need to find the value of $y$ when $x = 0.3$. The correct calculation is $y = 3 \times (0.3)^{2} = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

## 2: Identify the wrong answers and the calculation errors leading to them
- Option A: $0.81$ could result from $3 \times (0.3)^{2} = 3 \times 0.27 = 0.81$, which is incorrect because it mistakenly uses $0.27$ as the square of $0.3$ instead of squaring $0.3$ first.
- Option B: $0.27$ is the correct answer.
- Option C: $1.8$ could result from $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ then mistakenly multiplying by $2$ or other incorrect operations, but more likely from $3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$ (assuming a mistake in squaring $0.3$ to $0.6$).
- Option D: $2.7$ could result from $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ (mistaking $0.3^{2}$ as $0.9$).

## 3: Analyze the calculation errors and their attractiveness
- The error leading to $0.81$ (A) assumes a natural calculation but applies it incorrectly.
- The error for $1.8$ (C) seems to involve a confusion with linear rather than quadratic relationships or a miscalculation in squaring $0.3$.
- The error for $2.7$ (D) seems plausible if one mistakenly calculates $0.3^{2}$ as $0.9$.

## 4: Consider which students are likely to make these errors
- Students who are below_basic might not understand how to calculate $0.3^{2}$ or might add or multiply incorrectly.
- Basic students might understand the concept of squaring but make arithmetic mistakes.
- Proficient students are likely to calculate it correctly but might make a minor mistake.
- Advanced students are less likely to make errors.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students at each level choosing each option
Given the nature of the errors:
- Below_basic students are likely to choose options that result from very basic misunderstandings or arithmetic mistakes, so they might choose C or D more frequently due to simple multiplication or addition errors.
- Basic students might choose A or D because they understand the need to square but make arithmetic errors.
- Proficient students are likely to choose the correct answer or A due to careful calculation.
- Advanced students are likely to choose the correct answer.

## 6: Estimate the percentages
- **Below_basic**: A=10% (some understanding but wrong), B=5% (got it right by chance), C=30% (simple mistake), D=55% (common error).
- **Basic**: A=20% (common calculation error), B=40% (correct), C=20% (simple arithmetic mistake), D=20% (another common error).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (minor mistake), B=80% (correct), C=10% (occasional simple mistake), D=5% (less common error).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (unlikely mistake), B=95% (correct), C=0% (unlikely), D=5% (rare mistake).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=5% C=30% D=55%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
