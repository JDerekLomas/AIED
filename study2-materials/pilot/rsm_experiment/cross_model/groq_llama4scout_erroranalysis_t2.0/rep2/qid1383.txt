## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential errors
The question requires substituting \( k = -3 \) into the equation \( T = k^4 \) to find \( T \). The correct calculation is \( T = (-3)^4 = 81 \). To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, we need to consider common errors.

## 2: Identify common errors for each wrong option
- Option B (\( 12 \)) could result from \( (-3) \times 4 = -12 \) or incorrectly calculating \( (-3)^4 \) as \( 3^4 \div -1 \) or similar incorrect operations, but more likely from mistakenly applying a wrong operation or incorrectly simplifying.
- Option C (\( -81 \)) could result from \( -3^4 \) (not accounting for the power of 4 making the result positive).
- Option D (\( -12 \)) seems unlikely as a direct calculation error from \( k^4 \) but could be a miscalculation or confusion with a linear equation.

## 3: Analyze the errors in terms of student ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand exponent rules or might confuse operations. They could choose C (\( -81 \)) if they incorrectly apply the exponent or choose B (\( 12 \)) or D (\( -12 \)) due to a complete misunderstanding of the operation.
- **Basic:** Basic level students might understand the concept of exponents but apply them incorrectly or forget to account for the negative sign properly, leading to C (\( -81 \)) as a common mistake.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand exponents but might make careless mistakes. They are less likely to choose obviously incorrect options like B or D but could still fall into C if they mistakenly think \( (-3)^4 = -3^4 \).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to avoid all incorrect options and choose A (\( 81 \)), understanding that \( (-a)^n \) is positive for even n.

## 4: Estimate the percentages based on likely student responses
- **Below Basic:** Likely to see a high distribution across wrong answers due to fundamental misunderstandings. Let's assume A=20% (some get it right by chance or have a lucky guess), B=30% (simple miscalculation), C=40% (common error of not considering the power makes negative positives), D=10% (less common but possible error).
- **Basic:** These students have a better grasp but still make simple errors. So, A=60% (understand the concept), B=10% (simple mistake), C=25% (common error), D=5% (less likely).
- **Proficient:** Mostly understand the concept but may have minor slips. So, A=90% (strong understanding), B=5% (careless mistake), C=4% (occasional error), D=1% (rare).
- **Advanced:** Almost certainly choose A. So, A=98% (strong and confident), B=1% (extremely rare mistake), C=1% (very rare), D=0% (virtually impossible).

## 5: Assign specific percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=20%, B=30%, C=40%, D=10%
- **Basic:** A=60%, B=10%, C=25%, D=5%
- **Proficient:** A=90%, B=5%, C=4%, D=1%
- **Advanced:** A=98%, B=1%, C=1%, D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
