To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential errors.

The question requires students to calculate the mean of the numbers 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. The correct formula for the mean is \( \frac{\text{sum of all numbers}}{\text{total count of numbers}} \). For the given set of numbers, this translates to \( \frac{0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7}{5} \).

## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). This option is incorrect because it excludes the 0 from the sum, which is a critical part of calculating the mean.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \). This option incorrectly suggests performing the division before the addition or suggests adding and then dividing by 5, but the division by 5 should apply to the sum of all numbers, not just the 7. This follows the order of operations incorrectly for the intended calculation of mean.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \). This option incorrectly excludes the 0 from the sum and also incorrectly uses 4 (the count of numbers excluding the 0) as the denominator instead of 5 (the total count of numbers).

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D states "None of them". For students who correctly understand the formula for the mean, if none of the provided calculations (A, B, C) accurately represent the correct formula, they would choose this option.

## 5: Considering Student Errors
- **Excluding zero (Option A):** Students might overlook the 0, especially if they're not used to dealing with zeros in calculations. This could be an attractive mistake for students who are not meticulous.
- **Incorrect order of operations (Option B):** This can be attractive to students who remember to add but forget the proper division or are confused by the notation.
- **Incorrect count and excluding zero (Option C):** This seems like a double mistake, which might be less common but still possible among struggling students.
- **Recognizing the correct method (Implicit in Option D):** Students who are proficient or advanced should recognize that the correct calculation must include all numbers and divide by the total count.

## 6: Predictions Based on Ability Levels
### Below Basic
- A: 40% (some might just add up the numbers they see and divide by the count of numbers they add)
- B: 30% (they might think the division applies only to one of the numbers)
- C: 20% (could result from a double omission/error)
- D: 10% (understanding that none are correct might be too much for this level)

### Basic
- A: 20% (starting to realize 0 is part of the data but mess up division or inclusion)
- B: 35% (confusion with order of operations)
- C: 25% (similar errors to below basic but slightly better comprehension)
- D: 20% (recognizing errors but not the correct solution)

### Proficient
- A: 5% (understanding inclusion but error in dividing by correct number; highly unlikely)
- B: 20% (still getting order of operations mixed up)
- C: 10% (making significant errors)
- D: 65% (recognizing issues with A, B, and C)

### Advanced
- A: 0% (not likely to overlook zero)
- B: 5% (strong understanding usually prevents such errors)
- C: 0% (recognize both issues of excluding 0 and incorrect count)
- D: 95% (confidence in the formula leads to scrutiny of provided options)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=35% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=20% C=10% D=65%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
