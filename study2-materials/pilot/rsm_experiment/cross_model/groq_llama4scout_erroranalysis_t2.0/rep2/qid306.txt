To approach this question, let's first analyze the problems and the order of operations they require, then consider the common mistakes students might make.

## Step 1: Understanding the Problems
Problem P is \( 4 - 5 + 6 = \). According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), since there are no parentheses, exponents, or multiplication and division operations, we perform the operations from left to right. Therefore, the correct first step is \( 4 - 5 \).

## 2: Analyzing Problem Q
Problem Q is \( 4 + 5 \times 6 = \). Following the order of operations, multiplication comes before addition, so the correct first step is \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Problem P**: The correct calculation to do first is \( 4 - 5 \) because we follow operations from left to right when there are no other operations with higher precedence. 
- **Problem Q**: The correct calculation to do first is \( 5 \times 6 \) because multiplication has higher precedence than addition.

## 4: Identifying Common Mistakes
- A common mistake for students who are not proficient might be to incorrectly identify the order of operations or ignore it altogether.
- For Problem P, students might mistakenly start with \( 5 + 6 \) if they're not following the order of operations correctly or if they're trying to make the numbers "work" in a more straightforward way.
- For Problem Q, a common mistake is to start with \( 4 + 5 \), ignoring the multiplication.

## 5: Estimating Response Percentages
- **Below Basic**: These students might not understand the order of operations at all. They might think Problem P starts with \( 5 + 6 \) (C or D) and Problem Q starts with \( 4 + 5 \) (A or C), showing a lack of understanding. So, they might choose A or C (around 40-50% each) and less likely B or D.
- **Basic**: Basic students understand the concept but might apply it loosely. They might still confuse the operations but are more likely to choose the correct sequence or sequences that reflect a partial understanding, such as B (Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \)) which aligns with correct procedures.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students are more likely to get it right, choosing B as it correctly identifies \( 4 - 5 \) for Problem P and \( 5 \times 6 \) for Problem Q.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will almost certainly choose B, demonstrating a strong understanding of the order of operations.

## 6: Allocating Percentages
Given the above analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- **Basic**: A=20% B=50% C=20% D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%

The final response is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
