## Step 1: Understand the question and the possible errors
The question requires students to multiply the terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## 2: Identify the calculation errors leading to each wrong answer
- Option A: \(+4\) is the correct answer, so it's not a wrong answer but the correct one.
- Option B: \(-4\) would result from \(-1 \times 4\) or \(1 \times -4\), which is a misunderstanding of the signs or the terms being multiplied.
- Option C: \(+5\) doesn't result from a simple multiplication error of \(-1\) and \(-4\), suggesting a more complex mistake or a miscalculation.
- Option D: \(-5\) also doesn't directly result from multiplying \(-1\) and \(-4\), indicating another type of error.

## 3: Analyze the specific calculation error for each wrong option
- The error leading to B: \(-4\) could come from mistakenly using \(1 \times -4\) or \(-1 \times 4\), not \(-1 \times -4\).
- The errors leading to C: \(+5\) and D: \(-5\) are less straightforward and might come from adding or subtracting incorrectly or misinterpreting the operation.

## 4: Consider which errors are "attractive" and which students might catch themselves
- The mistake leading to B: \(-4\) might seem attractive because students often struggle with signs, and forgetting that two negatives make a positive could lead to this error.
- Options C and D seem less likely as they don't follow directly from common sign or basic multiplication errors.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option
### below_basic:
- Students at this level often struggle with basic arithmetic and might not even attempt the question or could choose randomly. Given the simplicity of the question, A: \(+4\) seems unlikely to be produced by error, B: \(-4\) could be a common mistake due to sign confusion, C: \(+5\) and D: \(-5\) seem less directly related to common errors in this context. 
- below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%

### basic:
- Students at this level understand basic operations but might make careless mistakes. The correct answer A: \(+4\) should be within reach, but B: \(-4\) remains a plausible mistake.
- basic: A=50% B=40% C=5% D=5%

### proficient:
- These students are more likely to get the question right but might still fall into traps. The correct answer A: \(+4\) should be commonly chosen, with fewer errors.
- proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%

### advanced:
- Advanced students are likely to understand the multiplication of negatives and positives well, minimizing errors. The correct answer should be highly prevalent.
- advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=40% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
