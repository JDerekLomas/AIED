For this question, I predict that many students would not be able to identify the correct answer despite the mistake being a common misconception, because:

- Option A represents the correct algebraic convention, although many students might be tricked into considering (c+4)/(h+4) as a reasonable option instead; they may see this format often in arithmetic and not expect this not in division.

However, the trickiest option of this question might be actually choice C) (c/h) + 4 for those who might think it seems somewhat different and a less straightforward algebra error compared to other alternatives.

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=50% D=0%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=40% D=0%
proficient: A=50% C=20% or possibly C at 30% depending on the group. I've chosen 30, B at 5 and  D=0%
advanced: 60% chose A, with C being around 5 (depending again). The weaker 'advanced' in algebra will probably fail here. However some might also opt in on an incorrect answer such as 'D=5'.
