Assuming the content knowledge is adequate, I predict the following:

below_basic: A=5% B=2% C=92% D=1%
basic: A=10% B=0% C=80% D=10%
proficient: A=0% B=5% C=95% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=3% C=97% D=0%

The reason 'greater or equal' is low is largely because, as a division follows the 'add' and 'add then divide then multiply or subtract', if they are familiar with order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS in UK), they wouldn't put 'greater or equal to'.
