Based on typical student responses and potential areas of confusion, I would estimate the following:

below_basic: 
B=55% A=20% C=5% D=20%

Typical below-basic students might perform basic calculations (subtraction or addition) first due to procedural fluency and lack of strategy. 

basic:
B=25% A=22% C=20% D=33%

At a basic level, students are starting to understand order of operations, but may apply simple addition/subtraction rules, which could make them choose the wrong order.

Below and basic level students tend to rely heavily on routine calculation procedures in this context.

proficient:
A=30% B=10% C=23% D=37%

Proficient students generally understand that subtraction (Problem P) has to be done before addition when two operations are in the order \(4+5-6\), but a lot still don't fully 'get' subtraction in reverse when the subtraction is the 'second operation' i.e. subtraction is being performed second. 

However for multiplication/addition (problem Q) students generally now prefer doing the multiplication first - they tend not to get fooled and do '5 *6 first' and hence 'only' 10% get it wrong as per the 'choice 'B'.

advanced:
B=2% C=5% A=1% D=90% 

Advanced students, as expected, perform exceptionally well when it comes to calculating order.  In problem Q, only about 2% get this completely wrong due to procedural error, however even more students choose 'A' - which could suggest they are 'following instruction order, instead doing multiplication before it (order of operations rule). This is because this choice (A) is a trick - many think 'following the given order 4+,  5, times,6 -  is best.'
