Consider a typical UK maths classroom.

below_basic: A=0% B=25% C=50% D=25%
The table is simple, but students at this level may misinterpret the equation or struggle to substitute values. Most will likely pick a small number (either option A or B) as it is a 'simpler' value, but may also incorrectly choose option C with a small value due to this tendency.

basic: A=50% B=25% C=20% D=5%
Students will likely understand that it requires substitution, but struggle with the exponent. This will make option D much harder since \(x^2 = 0.09\) and not any large number, but students at this level might pick D in error assuming the operation as something like 9*3=27 instead of the exponentiation. This might slightly skew B as the exponent of (0.3)^{2} can result in values that appear somewhat familiar, but A might be correct as they might have memorised or learned a 3 time 3 or similar.
