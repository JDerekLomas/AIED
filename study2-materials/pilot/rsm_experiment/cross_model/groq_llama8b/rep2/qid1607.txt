For this question, let's analyze each ability level's prediction.

* Below Basic: These students might not fully understand the process of solving algebraic equations involving fractions. I would estimate:
 * A) Only step 1: 60-70% 
* Basic: Students at this level can generally follow basic algebra, including solving linear and simple fraction-related equations. They might understand there was a mistake later on. I would estimate: 
 * A) Only step 1: 80-90%
 * B) Only step 2: 8-12%
 * C) Both steps are correct. and D)  Both steps are incorrect might have lower percentages.
 * D) Both steps incorrect will likely also be a percentage in the double digit. The students could get it right if only if a basic understanding about the process of the solving is there. 
 C): Both steps correct may get selected if the error is not clear. This is about recognizing that they would both be correct without seeing what it would take to get to that result from starting.
 Basic:  
A) Only step1:80%
B)Only step2:8%
C)Both: 5
* Proficient: Students at this level understand not only how to solve algebraic equations but also common patterns. However, for them it would be difficult, considering that  both  are presented. I would estimate: 
 A) Only step 1: 55%
 B) only step2: 10 
 * D: would also get picked and will have a percentage in the tens as well because these would be a result if you know what Isaac had done.
C): Both correct would most likely not be one but still would have  percentagelower and could be a percent lower than that of the correct answer if  there are multiple ways to get 61 or that the common pattern is just something simple
  proficient  
A)%50
B):  8  
D) : 15 -25.   
* Expert/Advance: With an in-depth understanding of algebraic equations and patterns, these pupils should recognize that Isaac committed an easy-to-see algebra mistake that should not occur at this skill level. I would estimate: 
A) only Step 1 20%
 * B and D can be in single digits but might vary. Both may appear when people are unsure whether a particular option in that choice is  a possible choice of steps taken if correct, given there being the other steps of a mistake, so, for an equation error it should have more than double in the double digits 
B Only step - 10 
 C) or Both will  get in the teens or low and will vary with the option they would choose.
