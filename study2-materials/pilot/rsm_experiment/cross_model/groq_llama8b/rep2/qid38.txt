I'll predict the percentage of students at each ability level would choose each option.

below_basic: A=20% ... B=30% B ... is an easily noticeable mistake, but the combination of fraction addition and variable might cause a bit of struggle so B seems most popular. But since many 'bottom group' maths students know how to find an lcd (Least Common Denominator) or simply add the numbers without variables (thinking 3x + 4x is like adding whole numbers together) they might actually see option A correctly (in simple terms they just 'forget' that they need to do this over x for some reason). However option C could attract people who know to add with common denominator but make another mistake later. So: A and B.

basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20% In this ability group many students may just not think through the adding part properly or they may find this adding difficult. So the combination of common factor addition and denominator problems would create errors like options A and B. Some, as with ability group below this might get B and add up the 3x 4x to make some 70/x or something close.

proficient: A=5% B=15% C=40% ... Students of this group would know that in terms of least common multiple we want 2x as denominator. The students however also would have noticed the fact you get (7x)/ (2x)... (the 3 * variable cancels one out). However those of these group who find the whole common factor trickiest (or they are a bit 'overcautious') end up with 6 over 2x.
