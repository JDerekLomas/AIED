This is a basic question on expanding simple algebraic expressions, so students at below average and average ability levels will tend to make errors due to simple procedural slips, such as:

* Not correctly applying the distributive law 
* Carrying out the multiplication of terms in the correct order.
  
However, the misconception that is tested is more of the simple error type that can occur in procedural algebra. Students might forget to multiply out all parts correctly which does not relate directly to the misconceptions in understanding.

Assuming most students have a good understanding of distributive law and algebraic manipulation, the majority should get it spot on. Below, I will make an educated guess on student performance.

below_basic: A=20% B=35% C=5% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=40% C=10% D=10%
proficient: B=5%  C=5% A=35% D=55% (These students will tend to be more accurate.)
advanced: C and A=1.5% each or even less, B=20% D=77.5% 
Note that proficient and advanced level students should not make any errors at all, yet due to the nature of teaching, it is hard to assume that all students with an upper ability level would achieve perfection. I assume there might be 5 students out of 100 proficient level, who would get a wrong result due to lack of experience in a similar or more complex questions or not taking into account their actual mathematical knowledge. In this regard proficient will likely still show high confidence in their results as compared to lower ability level students.
