Below.Basic: A=10% B=0% C=0% D=0%
The main idea behind choosing option A below the basic standard is that they may get V and \( V^{\frac13} \) (the cube root of volume) confusingly mixed, and since they will not fully have the skill to recall or compute cube root formulae and may rely heavily on recall from the volume equation \( V = \pi x^3 \) where they see V and think cube root for radius.

Basic: A=70% B=1% C=15% D=0%
Below the proficient level, basic students may recall that formula for the volume involves \( \pi x^3.2 \pi \), so if it isn't in the options they might not have much choice other than recalling their 'cube root of radius' and this usually involves \( \pi x^3 \). This usually means they tend to remember option A which they are aware to be an expression of volume (because they have the cube of r in their memory). They are aware that the correct way to put this cube root into the volume is the denominator and since \( r x^3. 2\pi\) looks like the answer to this type of problem.
