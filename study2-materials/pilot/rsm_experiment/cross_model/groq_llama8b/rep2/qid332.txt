Analysis:
This question is about inverse operations and solving equations. For students below basic, many would know to add 5 to both sides to isolate the term with the variable. This operation makes the answer A straightforward (80%). 
In contrast, for those proficient or advanced, understanding that this operation will also change one side of the equation from having a fraction to not having one, they are likely to consider Katie's option B) (which would incorrectly subtract 5, not be adding back from subtracting 17 from 3x as an inverse operation), and may see the equation in both standard, or "fractional" formats or standard format with an unknown variable. As a result proficient or advanced may be uncertain when it comes to selecting a correct response, and therefore will pick A, as it would require adding both sides, but this operation might also eliminate the fractional coefficient. 
The above rationale is due to how many in advanced may struggle due to an uncertainty, but not from misconception, they understand both, but may also get both or nothing right.
