below_basic: A=40% B=80% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=80% c= 50% d=20%
proficient: A=60% B=50% C=10% D=35%
advanced: A=90% B=25% c= 5% D=15% 

Justification for the advanced levels:

A. Students at or above advanced levels should recognize that you are calculating the mean, which is the sum of the numbers (including the 0, because mean is defined as sum/n), then dividing by how many numbers there are: (1+3+4+7)/5 

B. Some at advanced might be slightly tripped up that it does not follow their instinct, but students who understand order of numbers (first add all the given numbers, then divide) have the better intuition, but most will not get caught up and the majority are likely to get confused and be misled.

C: Those at advanced will quickly recognize it cannot give the correct answer (this involves some understanding of why they think it won’t), however a lot of proficient and even basic students might think '4 ' because there are 4 actual numbers above that.
