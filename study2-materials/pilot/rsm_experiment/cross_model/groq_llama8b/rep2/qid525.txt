Below Basic:  A=10% B=%90 
    While this group might struggle to convert the mixed numbers into improper fractions, most struggle significantly more on other aspects of addition. In fact they might struggle to correctly convert any mixed-numeral question of this form, meaning answer C becomes more of an outlier for them.

Basic: A=%10 B=35% C=%55 
    Many in this group convert successfully into improper fractions. However this conversion may lead, or rather lead people in this group more frequently down an error-prone route for the calculation - converting to a decimal might be an instinctual option as an alternate path.

Proficient: A=40% B=50% C=10%

    As students get proficient the likelihood of errors drops, and more accurate conversion happens. Students who might not fully understand that they have converted successfully to decimal or who don't see that it could make for simplifying and then re-conversion in an incorrect manner would pick answer 'a'
Advanced: B=60%
