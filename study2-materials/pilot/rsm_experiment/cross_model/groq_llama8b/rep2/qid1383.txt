below_basic: A=20% B=0% C=50% D=30%
basic: A=0% B=0% C=25% D=75%
proficient: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%

My predictions:

- Most students struggle to remember their exponent tables past 2 or 3 for basic calculations and the concept might get too farfetched at below basic.
- Those able enough in the basic abilities, may know  the number 6 being the fourth number of power of three (\(3^4=-81\) &  (-3) isn't far enough away from zero that basic level maths remember these). The fourth root would indeed get  -3 but as basic students usually don't understand roots they would be confused between \( T=k^4\) &  the fourth root so, I think most students at basic level are going to get it completely the opposite so, answer -D.
- Proficient pupils will not have any hesitation between k4 and \((\frac{k}{\sqrt[4]{\sqrt[4]{}}}{(sqrt)^2})^{3}\). 
- For those who are above the basics and very advanced at maths in this field, the formula of \( T=k^{\prime 42} \) will become a piece of memory and hence  the right option for  -B
