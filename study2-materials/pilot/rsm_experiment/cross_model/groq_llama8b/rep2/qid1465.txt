Assuming UK A-level math format, where most math teaching begins with GCSE (A*-G) prior to the A-Levels, I can approximate student choices. These predictions would not be universally correct but offer an educated breakdown.

Consideration here is based on BODMAS order as this order is the typical method taught at the initial math courses. 

below_basic: A=2% B=8% C=0% D=90% (These will likely struggle with basic calculation or the understanding of how BODMAS works for complex orders)

basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40% (Most will attempt basic calculation; some might forget to check BODMAS order. Many will incorrectly multiply 4 and 2 prior or forget how to correctly calculate.)

proficient: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10% (Proficient students should recall BODMAS. Still, a small number will struggle at this level, possibly misremember 5 or 10 times tables. They should all do it by using an order system however, most proficient maths students should correctly use the order of operations, which this requires the most to calculate properly and avoid common errors from confusion.) 

advanced: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3% (At an advanced level, math students usually remember the specific correct rules and should know how multiplication has priority. Some might occasionally slip but overall get it correct.)
