Given its content, the question requires a combination of arithmetic and mental math skills along with understanding the order of operations.

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=25% D=5% (Students at this ability level may struggle with basic arithmetic and will often rely on guessing, with some being fortunate with choices A and B.)
basic: A=50% B=25% C=20% D=5% (While they may get the calculation right using an online calculator, they still might not have an intuitive feel for when division and addition interact within their arithmetic.)
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15% (These students tend to get it correctly but not for understanding; they use trial and error, and if it was multiple choice.)
advanced: A=5% or even less, B=8%, C=87%, and the 0% goes to  D = as many have factored out the division in step, 8/4 which would equate to simplifying the rest and understanding the correct solution would indeed be "equals"
