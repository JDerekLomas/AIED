The predicted percentages are based on the reasoning skill required for expanding the brackets without the commutative property error: proficient students in mathematics typically have a good foundation and will not make an easy to spot mistake; most may however still fall into the commutative error for an algebra question of this type with students often forgetting that when using algebraic expansions, terms can be in different or same orders because of how they expand in order.
