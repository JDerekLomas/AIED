below_basic: A=0% B=2% C=98% D=0%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=40% D=35%
proficient: A=15% B=20% C=10% D=55%
advanced: A=30% B=40% C=5% D=25%
I would predict lower success in basic and proficient students, mainly due to difficulty in manipulating the fraction expression with a variable x and potential issues of not being able to find a common denominator quickly.

For advanced, option B is the right choice using a common denominator.
