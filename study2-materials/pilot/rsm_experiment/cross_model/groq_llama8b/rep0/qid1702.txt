Most students would be familiar with using x and y from linear functions in the form ax = by. They are given one y value and an equation and asked to fill a new x or y value with it - in this case finding a second y-value for one x-value.

The equation '10x - 6y = 30' should easily lend itself to finding a point that satisfies all the given values - here, we're trying to plug the y value to see which x satisfies the table when x's value will be plugged in for the equation. 
A lot of basic pupils would have issues with algebra but not with linear equations or functions and could likely guess and verify by looking at each equation (10, 0 for instance).
For basic students who understand simple linear equations in the format given but who still haven't really seen this exact format could guess D as 3 is more often taught as an example in schools and it fits the given point perfectly. Proficient students should have a grasp on linear relationships with both y=mx+c as well as in the format you've used and so the choices between the numbers could easily cause confusion.
