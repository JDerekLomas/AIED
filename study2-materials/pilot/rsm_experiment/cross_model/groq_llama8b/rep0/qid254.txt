below_basic: A=40% B=None (most of these students will just plug-and-chug with the correct formula) B= 0%  C=None  D=None 
basic: A=70% B=10%  C=10% D=None%  (these students will often struggle to apply rules of division to find means and may not use the division symbol correctly)
proficient: A=80%   B=5%  C=10% D=5%  (these students might struggle with understanding that in most textbook methods, you don't sum the numbers first then divide in this simplified scenario and may incorrectly assume some kind of division symbol was needed)
advanced: A=5%      B=0%   C=85% D=None  (most of these students will immediately spot the correct method but could possibly be caught out and choose A due to their understanding in different types of scenarios.)  Note some will likely choose "None" due to spotting that it's an arithmetic mean but could also spot that division is the next step
