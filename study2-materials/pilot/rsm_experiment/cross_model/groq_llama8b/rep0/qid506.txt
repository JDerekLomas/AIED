Based on the equation \( 3p = \frac{1}{12} \), I expect students to struggle with the inverse operation of the 12 in the denominator, considering they have to multiply by 3 on the numerator to keep the fraction equal.

Below_basic: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
In this group, the students will generally understand multiplication but may struggle with more complex fractions and operations like division in the equation. They will likely pick option A due to not considering the multiplication of p on both sides due to the difficulty with the division, which requires multiplying by 3 and by inverting on both sides to correctly solve, hence they pick option A as its straightforward and less likely that they consider the fraction that is correct. 

Basic: A=75% B=12% C=6% D=7%
At this level, a majority still struggle with fractions but some will begin to grasp that dividing by the fraction to 'move things over' needs both sides to be flipped and have a reciprocal on both. They are generally better at the inverse but this would require multiplying both sides by a reciprocal to solve this particular question. Hence there is a good mix as students might pick any of the remaining options.

Competent/Proficient in Math: 
Basic skills are applied, now the 'higher end' basic or entry level proficient would be able to flip the equation around and understand the multiplication to be carried out to get p = 1/(3* twelve) 
proficient: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%

The advanced mathematicians will see this one as straightforward: 
Advanced: A=30% B=40% C=0.1% D=30%
