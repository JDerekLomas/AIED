Based on experience and analysis, here's the predicted response distribution:

below_basic: A=75% B=15% C=7% D=3%
basic: A=85% B=9% C=4% D=2%
proficient: A=65% B=20% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%

Justification:
- Students who perform poorly might add just the whole numbers (e.g., 2+1=3), resulting in option A, since 3 is part of mixed number option A (\3 \frac{3}{5}\).
- Below-basic students are likely to choose option A if they incorrectly carry over the fractional part to add the mixed fractions' numerators. Proficient or advanced students can handle this process, reducing the chances from above basic students.

Given context and knowledge:
- At the basic level: Most can add numbers correctly, but if their mental arithmetic involves approximations or simplifications, the possibility for confusion exists; this makes B, where improper fractions might seem easier, less chosen than the simpler whole-numbers combination of option A by a basic level.
- A majority of advanced learners can handle mixed numerators and will notice the options don't require simplifying or converting the final fraction.

To correctly answer this problem, real learners would not fall into common errors triggered by other math misconceptions, but this is a very good test for checking that students understand mixed fractions addition with non-cancelled-out numerators.
