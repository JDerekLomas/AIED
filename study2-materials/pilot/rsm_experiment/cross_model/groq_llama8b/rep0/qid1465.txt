below_basic: A=90% C=2% 
(Students below the grade for this topic may find the question format unfamiliar or confusing. This would lead to widespread answers of a numerical value, or, for the misconception-prone, an incorrect calculation like C.)

basic: A=75% C=12% B=6% 
(Student responses will generally be in line with typical BIDMAS errors - forgetting the subtraction part. However, as B=4 is the accurate solution following proper order, basic math pupils may recognize the subtraction first or get confused.)

proficient: A=65% B=18% C=6% D=4%
(Maths pupils that meet proficiency will be able to recall how to work through expressions correctly. However, 1 in 6 proficient pupils at best will incorrectly calculate due to forgetting subtraction.)

advanced: A=55% B=23% C=10% D=6%
(Pupils advanced may know BIDMAS, however still may occasionally get incorrect for misinterpretation at some point during solving, or forgetting a number. Advanced-level responses, though, should significantly reduce the incorrect choices.)
