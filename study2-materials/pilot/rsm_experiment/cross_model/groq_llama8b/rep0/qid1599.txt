This specific question seems fairly straightforward for students who are familiar with algebraic expressions and conventions. 

Considering this, we can anticipate how students from different ability levels would perform:

below_basic: A=15% B=5% C=60% D=20%
Basic students are likely familiar with division, but may not fully understand the concept of the horizontal line representing 'division by' or 'into'. 
- Option A seems too abstract, which could deter weaker students making it a low pick. B seems plausible, as does C for those who are not understanding the concept. 
- Many will mistakenly try to combine or manipulate parts incorrectly, landing option D to around 20% for a basic level.

basic: A=50% B=10% C=25% D=15%

These students understand the concept, but the calculation seems too straightforward for some (especially with the presence of constants +4 and simple variable h), making B around 10%.

proficient: A=85% B=8% C=4% D=3%

At a proficient level, most students would have no problems remembering or understanding that 'c divide (open bracket h, plus 4, close bracket)' is the convention for showing this operation - this seems fairly clear from just looking, especially in the format of a UK secondary question with this style of algebra.

advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%

Higher ability students would likely choose A, being the more complex but mathematically equivalent expression. 

Keep in mind however students in general will choose more familiar expressions when in doubt; a less complex or 'commonly' expressed term may seem more accessible or appealing even if it appears wrong on initial glance and thus it may seem more intuitive and may lead them into making error.
