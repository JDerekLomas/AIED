Based on my experience and understanding of math concepts being taught to UK students at different levels, the predicted answers would be:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
These students may struggle to add a whole number to a mixed number. Without clear procedures to guide them, their choices may be random, with A and C seeming possible to below_basic level students, while others might simply select option B as familiar. They would have minimal chance of selecting D or accurately converting mixed numbers.

basic: A=10% B=90% C=0% D=0%
At this level, they could add the mixed numbers, but their attention to detail might be a problem or converting a result to a non-mixed form is difficult so their result would be mostly A incorrect answer and all incorrect for option  C and D due confusion when it came to converting  to mixed numbers in these answers and converting back to a mixed number.

proficient: A=20% B=60% C=15% D=5%
These students understand the steps required to add the mixed numbers but their calculation speed could cause the issue here which is in error with B, or an alternative option, C or, even with D.

advanced: A=B=40% C=10% D=10%
The advanced class would most likely have an accurate answer to this problem. Their attention to detail will be high and they have the best knowledge on which method of addition to use (add fractions with their commmens and use the correct method) which would put the 40-40 split at answer B or 99/2 divided down in the other correct answer
