below_basic: B=60% C=20% A=10% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=40% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=50% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=15% B=55% C=25% D=5%

Reasoning:
This question involves expanding the brackets. Below basic students may confuse the signs between m and the constants. 

Advanced and proficient students might remember the difference of squares (DOS) formula (a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2;  this formula can be adjusted when a or/b are substituted for m-(a number). Most will see that m=0 to substitute values in which would reveal option A's correct expansion m^2 - (m-5)(m-5) + m( m (7) ) -5(m), then simplify accordingly.

Basic students are expected to be aware of the signs being negative or positive and will be somewhat more accurate.

Below basic students are more inclined to get this incorrect, as they often fail to recognize patterns. 

It is assumed most will correctly answer the multiple and the correct formula. However, as the problem requires the ability to apply the pattern that leads to using the correct option; many would answer B, with many being confused and unsure.
