D students at the lowest level and many C students at higher levels should not struggle here. D students may simply pick their own value for '-a quarter' while students who understand fractions well would select -\frac{4}{4} as a negative 1, therefore \frac{-4}{3}  is more likely than the options which would give you the answer A. Many higher-level students may think of dividing by fractions which they might know makes your answer, A -\(\frac{3}{\frac{4}{x)) or in reverse order \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{x}. 

Keep in mind that some students, particularly D students, will struggle with the context and may simply multiply \(-\frac{3}{4}\) by "any small/large negative/positive" without the idea of an operation to cancel out its -3 part.
