For UK maths curriculum, a sphere's volume is taught after volume of cylinder/prisms using the formula for a sphere is \(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}\). Since this is not typically covered early, proficiency levels are used for the percentage choices and will have to assume higher level knowledge.

assuming most students have not yet met or have only briefly touched upon it, 

below_basic: A=50% B=5% C=5% D=40%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=1%, some basics in curriculum will still have covered the cubic volume part
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=85% B=10% C=5%. D=0%, most having learned sphere volume formulas know where \(C\) is incorrect and that B is incorrect due to lack of cube root to balance.
