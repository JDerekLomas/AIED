I'd predict the following percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=50% C=10% D=10%
These students might not understand the concept of averages and might think they need to add numbers first, before splitting or dividing.
 
basic: A=50% B=38% C=6% D=6%
Basic students would struggle a bit as they understand the concepts but some may incorrectly split some calculations, and they might not realize the error in some options.

proficient: A=68% B=26% C=2% D=4%
Advanced students would easily be aware of the mistake. 

advanced: A=92% B=6% C=1% D=1%
All the advanced students would get the right answer despite the trickiness of the options. Since 0 is given in the data, you must multiply to get a mean - you should then see 2, not one of the numbers given - to get (0+1+3+4+7)/5.
