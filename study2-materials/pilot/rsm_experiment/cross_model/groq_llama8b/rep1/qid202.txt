This question seems to require adding mixed numbers with fractions. Advanced students can break down 2 1⁄5 as (13⁄5), and 1 2⁄5 as (7⁄5) or (12⁄5) plus 3⁄5 (as 5⁄5, which makes 3⁄5 easier by having 1⁄5 as + (4⁄5+1)⁄5 which was an attempt), they add to (24⁄5)= \( \frac{6+24}{5} = \frac{30}{5} \)  is (6). And so on.
