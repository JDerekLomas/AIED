Based on student behavior and potential misconceptions, I would estimate the following percentages:

below_basic: 
A= 90% 
B= 5% 
C= 4% 
D= 1%

basic: 
A= 85% 
B= 10% 
C= 4% 
D= 1%

proficient: 
A= 60% 
B= 30% 
C= 8% (Some proficient students will solve accurately while others may misinterpret the question and perform the actual operation \(12\times\))
D= 2%

advanced: 
A= 10% 
B= 75% 
C= 10% (Some may choose '4' due to incorrect assumptions on what p=\frac{p(3)}{(3\text{ times 4} = 12)  = \frac{p}{{}_{ \text{4}}}$ means for  \frac{{}_{4\text{ }p}(3 ) }{{ }{}^{ }\text{ }{}3\times4}
D= 5%

In these assumptions, it is presumed students are familiar with the division by single-digit numbers but not yet mastered division or fractions to a proficient level for students on the advanced tier.
