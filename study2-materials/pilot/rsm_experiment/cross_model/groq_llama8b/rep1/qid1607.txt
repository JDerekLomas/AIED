Based on my understanding of students at different ability levels, here is my prediction for the distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=5% C=1% D=74%
These students typically struggle with manipulating inequalities and fractions, and many might not even understand that to solve the equation \( 15 = \frac{1 + k}{4} \), they need to multiply both sides by 4. When told to solve it in a step-by-step process, those at the below.basic level typically fail at this kind of problem solving scenario in mathematics.

basic: A=65% B=20% C=5% D=10%
Basic-level students should be able to understand that the steps might involve manipulating the given equation, but they can struggle to perform simple calculations and fractions properly.

proficient: A=70% B=25% C=2% D=3%
Proficient students have a stronger understanding of the algebra and are often able to correctly execute steps to calculate the given variable. These levels of students, however are often susceptible to making arithmetic error in these complex problems.

advanced: A=45% B=35% C=10% D=10%
Advanced-level students are often skilled at algebra and should be able to spot Isaac's mistake in manipulating his steps incorrectly. These levels are the group from who, it is expected, some students would get it slightly wrong or get tricked, due to understanding more sophisticated algebra in general.
