below_basic: A=5% B=70% C=12% D=12% (Below basic maths students are still learning the order of operations, so they are most likely to think dividing happens first but get the wrong outcome due to their lack of understanding or forgetfulness. However, some might choose B as there's an intuitive assumption dividing by a power or factor can simplify calculations.)

basic: A=10% B=50% C=30% D=10% (Basic maths students can recall the order of operations. However, those still unsure might not know if (x + y))^(power) = x^(power) + y^(power)); the student chooses a symbol assuming it's x^(power). A is still less than 10% chosen because even fewer maths students forget how to order multiplication before a subtraction)

proficient: A=2% B=5% C=80% D=13% (Mathematically proficient students will quickly remember how exponents work and correctly recall: 
(8) ^ (2 - 1)  -  16   =      8  
Thus  (  8  ^ )  6  >    7 
They choose >)

advanced: B=1% C=98% D=>2%
(A) is almost unheard of amongst these students.
