As an experienced maths teacher, I've analyzed the question and the potential pitfalls students may encounter. Here's my prediction of student response percentages based on their ability level:

Below_basic: A=90% B=5% C=4% D=2% (These students may have some difficulty with division, possibly confusing the order or the notation, but most can still get at the idea of simplifying a division with an added value in the divisor)
basic: A=95% B=2% C=3% D=1%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=5% *
advanced: A=75% B=16% C=8% D=1% (* Note that more of the proficient students, possibly due to an overthinking strategy of attempting simplifications first, might initially select an option like C that then appears incorrect. This might increase their chance of being mistaken compared to more basic students and advanced students who are aware of division in a formula.)

Please note that the predictions may vary depending on the actual abilities and knowledge of the students and how familiar they are with algebraic notation.
