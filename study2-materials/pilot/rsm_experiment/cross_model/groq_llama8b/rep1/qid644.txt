below_basic: A=2% B=40% C=20% D=38%
basic: A=5% B=45% C=20% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
advanced: A=25% for proficient students would have done this question well,  so A=17.5%, leaving D around 20% and this will make up the percentage of the remaining 75%. Thus: A=17.5, D=22.5 for advanced students
