Based on my expertise as a UK maths teacher and the typical student response patterns, I've estimated the percentage of students who would choose each option. Keep in mind that these are predictions and might vary slightly depending on the specific school and the maths curriculum used.

Below Basic ( approx. 20%) (students who struggle with order of operations and basic calculation):
A=40% B=15% C=30% D=15% (Below Basic students might get the correct answer by chance or struggle due to order of operations or basic calculation)

Basic (approx. 40%) (students who struggle with basic order of operations and sometimes miss simple operations):
A=55% B=20% C=15% D=10% (Basic students might still get caught in the misconception but a significant portion know to follow order of operations correctly.)

Proficient (approx. 30%) ( students who know order of operations but might make errors under pressure or when there are distractions within the text):
A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5% (Proficient students should follow the order of operations correctly, thus choosing the right answer.)

Advanced (approx. 10%) (students highly confident and who would always apply PEMDAS/BODMAS):
A=95% B=2% C=0% D=3%
