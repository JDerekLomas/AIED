below_basic: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
basic: A=99% B=1% C=1% D=<0.5%
proficient: A=98% B=1% C=<.5% D=<1%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=2% D=2% 


Reasoning:

- 'below_basic': The majority would have poor knowledge and experience with algebra; most struggle with brackets, and the idea that they are simply 'reversals' would give them difficulties in expanding this. This leaves the '2+/-6' rule as a common 'guess/ rule of thumb'. The question relies significantly on their algebra skills for them and would easily confuse them.

- 'basic': These students would normally have a fair grasp on brackets but still not know about FOIL. The confusion may stem from not being entirely sure when and if they should change signs, making B look very confusing due, potentially also from them just applying an incorrect 'algebraic pattern'. D doesn't make a lot of sense, as their 'algebra skills for 1/6 and -4 rules of thumbs for these signs' won't match, leaving C looking plausible because its incorrect answer 'rule' seems plausible as well for these levels to the point they would just use their 'common-sense', intuition rather than a correct method, and therefore D being less attractive. A would look like they did it incorrectly using the incorrect rules.

- 'proficent': Although they can use FOIL, they would find that there may have been times when they had to change signs, which may leave doubt in their minds about which rules are correct, so they may just decide not to follow 'FOIL'. This uncertainty makes it difficult for them with confidence in the signs and their method so they may just go with '2m +/- 3' to try to get close enough.

- 'advanced level students' still use FOIL correctly most, so this question becomes relatively simple due to these factors so, for a 'difficult misconception question', many still manage it fairly well, still giving a slightly better percentage for correct expansion to students.
