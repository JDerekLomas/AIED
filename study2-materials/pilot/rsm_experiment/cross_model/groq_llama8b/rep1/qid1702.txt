Based on typical student abilities and knowledge, here's a prediction of their performance on this question:

below_basic: A=70% B=10% C=20% D=0 %
In this case, 'below basic' students would likely focus more on the number given for y (0.5) and choose the answer with a matching value when calculating x. This is a calculation-based question with straightforward numbers, making it manageable despite their relatively weak maths skills.

basic: A=90% B=5% C=5% D=0%
Basic students should remember to substitute y into 10x - 6y = 30 from the equation. However, they might be uncertain about which answer choice corresponds to the given y in terms of x and might not perform a simple subtraction calculation properly.

proficient: A=85% B=10% C=4% D=1%
Proficient students who understand simple algebra and how substitution works would get this right, but those who don't check their substitution carefully at all might still fall into a trap.

advanced: A=80% B=12% C=6% D=1.5 %
Higher achievement levels indicate a higher probability to double-check for errors and to consider possible calculation options and so the higher number of those choosing the alternative options.
