Based on student abilities and common misconceptions in math, I have made the following predictions:

Below Basic: Since the volume formula involves calculus, students at this level might struggle with the underlying concepts and mathematical operation (calculating the cube root).
A=30% (they correctly choose the formula, but misapply it due to calculation issues)
B=20% (this option seems similar but is slightly wrong; some students with weak problem-solving skills might pick it)
C=20% (they correctly choose the format, cube root and V and π, but misplace numbers)
D=30% (incorrect application of concept)

Basic: Students will apply formulas incorrectly when they get stuck on the format or the order of operation (e.g., getting \(  \frac{ \sqrt[3]{4V\pi }}  { 3\sqrt[3]{\pi } } = \frac{ \sqrt[3]{4V\pi }} {\sqrt[3]{(3)(\pi)^3 }} = \sqrt[3]{\frac {4V\pi}{3\pi^2} }.  \)
A= 0% (this answer requires higher math knowledge)
B=60% (some struggle understanding the order but others understand, so it's not a completely easy but very hard option)
C=15% (this answer may trick students using the π factor correctly at the denominator; students pick this if they have an incorrect π relationship)
D=25% (similar errors appear with incorrect handling of constants in formula)

Proficient: Students who are proficient might have difficulty distinguishing between correct formula structures and the order or placement of certain terms. This would cause them confusion:
A=0-3%
B=55%
(C students from basic, combined with a very little from A category as some students from basic would have picked option B too)
C=3-9% (some A students might fall into this trap as their basic knowledge might be sufficient, but higher cognitive function isn't present to see this order being incorrect) 
D=3-10%-5% (Students with an incomplete basic understanding will fall more into the below category)

Advanced: Advanced students know both formulas and can apply them, however some struggle applying the formulas in new contexts (specifically with the volume and radius for a sphere) 
A=70-80% 
B=8% (They might still be misinterpreting and think that this might just be one of their multiple formula options to select from in such question)
C=70-80% (They can see that C has the correct values present as π is a crucial and often overlooked factor and can be applied in many contexts)
