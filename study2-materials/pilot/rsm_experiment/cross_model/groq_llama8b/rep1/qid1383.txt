Assuming a GCSE-level maths syllabus in the UK:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=40% D=0%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%

Most students at each level would find this straightforward. The equation \( T = k^2 \) suggests exponentiation, which may trick some lower ability or below-basic students into thinking \( k^{(-2)} = (-3)^{2} = 9\), which leads them to choose B.
