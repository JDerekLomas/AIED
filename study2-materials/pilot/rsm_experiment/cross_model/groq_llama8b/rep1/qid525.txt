based on student performance in maths and common mistakes.

below_basic: A=20% B=5% C=25% D=50%
In the UK maths curriculum, at this level, students typically start learning fractions and their addition but struggle understanding fractions on their own. 

basic: A=40% B=50% C=5% D=5%
With a basic understanding, they might start adding the whole number and then the fraction part independently.

proficient: A=15% B=75% C=7% D=3%
At proficient, students can accurately calculate \( \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} \) then add it to 3 (the implied equivalent mixed fraction for 2), but might still need reminding to combine this and leave the answer as a mixed number.

advanced: B=10% C=80% A=5% D=5%
Students at the highest levels will be able to directly manipulate the mixed fractions without needing the extra step of equivalent forms and combining whole and partials.
