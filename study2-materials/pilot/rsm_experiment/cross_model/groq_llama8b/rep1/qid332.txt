Below_basic: A=40% B=50% C=10% D=0%
Basic: A=55% B=35% C=5% D=5%
Proficient: A=65% B=25% C=5% D=5%
Advanced: A=80% B=10% B=5% D=5%

The correct answer depends heavily on algebraic manipulation, as well as understanding inverse operations. Students are able to see the mistake in Katie's work by identifying she adds on a '5' instead of doing the required operation on her LHS to solve.

Students below the basic level are predicted to still pick the correct option A, however the percentages are lower, with option B selected by the largest percent. 

As the ability level increases so do the percentages for answer A. Students who find option A correct often find it by realising Katie is 'moving the 5 from its initial position' to her answer line.

The advanced students find the answer to be the least likely to be option D, as only students with strong proof reading skills and mathematical knowledge would have identified this as incorrect after reading.
