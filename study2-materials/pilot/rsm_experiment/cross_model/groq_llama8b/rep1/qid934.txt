Based on general student behavior and misconceptions related to algebra and tables of values, the prediction for student responses at various ability levels is as follows:

below_basic: A=50% B=20% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2.5% C=1.5% D=1%

This prediction reflects the tendency of lower-ability students to guess or rely on visual impressions, and the difficulty for some basic-level students to perform simple arithmetic (although the arithmetic needed for all options except B can be quickly computed, even if there doesn't immediately leap to mind for many students).

Higher-ability students are more likely, however, to correctly calculate options A and C, or spot that 4(1) + 2(y)=10 (so that y equals 2.5) even if initially not spotting that they should have solved for just the value of y by putting in the x.
