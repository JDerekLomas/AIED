This specific question may look simple but has room for error due to lack of understanding. Many students could get confused and make this question a lot harder than it initially looks.

For less able students (Bottom three sections), there may be a chance for misconception due to lack of understanding of fraction multiplication.

It may come down to guessing at a higher end for option C given more knowledge of multiplication facts or an understanding that if times by \( -\frac34 \) then you are looking for something that, when negative is, turned positive.
