Here's my prediction of how students at different ability levels would perform on this question:

**Reasoning:**

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level often struggle with basic algebraic manipulation. They might not understand the order of operations or how to correctly isolate the variable. They might be drawn to option B simply because they see an equals sign followed by 'k'. They're likely to make arithmetic errors or misinterpret the steps.
*   **Basic:** These students have some understanding of solving equations but can be prone to errors in execution. They might be able to identify that Step 1 is correct but then mistakenly add 1 instead of subtracting it in the second step. Many in this group will not check their work or solve for 'k'.
*   **Proficient:** Students at this level should be able to solve this equation correctly. They will correctly identify Step 1 as correct as multiplying both sides by 4 is obvious. They can correctly subtract 1 in the next step. Therefore, they can easily find Step 2 is incorrect. They are least likely to make a simple arithmetic error.
*   **Advanced:** These students will quickly and accurately solve the equation and identify the steps. They might even do it mentally.

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=55% B=15% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=2% D=2%
