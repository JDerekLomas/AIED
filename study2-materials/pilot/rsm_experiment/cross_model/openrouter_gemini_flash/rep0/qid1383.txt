Here's my prediction of how students at different ability levels would answer this question, based on my experience as a UK maths teacher:

This question tests the order of operations with a negative number raised to an even power. The key is whether students know/remember that (-3)^4 = (-3)*(-3)*(-3)*(-3) = 81, and can avoid common errors. The question is relatively straightforward if students take their time, however the negative sign can often trip students up.

basic: A=65% B=10% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=3% C=5% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
