Here's my prediction for how students of different ability levels would perform on this question:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%

Explanation:

*   **below_basic:** Students at this level struggle with fraction manipulation and negative signs. They may not understand the inverse relationship needed for multiplication to result in 1. Many might guess or confuse the roles of numerator and denominator when trying to "undo" the fraction. The negative signs cause additional confusion, making B, C and D relatively equally likely to be chosen.

*   **basic:** These students have some understanding of fractions and negative numbers, but struggle with applying them correctly. Many will realize they need to "flip" the fraction and appreciate the role of the sign, but may not connect the final sign (negative times negative gives positive) so choose option B. Some may still confuse numerator and denominator or just choose the fraction looking similar to the one in the question.

*   **proficient:** Most students at this level should be able to solve this correctly. They understand the concept of reciprocals and the rules for multiplying negative numbers. The slight challenge presented by the negative signs may cause some to hesitate and consider other options, yet most will correctly choose A.

*   **advanced:** These students should find this question very straightforward. They quickly identify the reciprocal and apply the rules for negative signs with ease, making A the obvious choice. Any errors at this level are likely careless mistakes.
