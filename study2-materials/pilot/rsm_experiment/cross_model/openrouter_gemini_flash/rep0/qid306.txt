Here's my prediction of how students at different ability levels would answer this question, along with my reasoning:

**Reasoning:**

*   **Problem P (4-5+6):** This tests understanding of order of operations with addition and subtraction. Since they have equal precedence, you work left to right. The first calculation is 4-5. This is generally well understood among older students, but negative numbers can throw *some* students.

*   **Problem Q (4+5 x 6):** This tests understanding of the order of operations, specifically that multiplication comes before addition. So, you do 5 x 6 first. This is a standard order of operations question. The format is clear.

**Predicted Results:**

below_basic: A=35% B=30% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=3% D=5%

**Explanation of Predictions:**

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level likely struggle with order of operations and may choose operations more or less randomly. I predict a lot of these students will just do the sums in order, hence the high A %. There is also a good chance they will pick D, because "multiplication is always the first thing to do".
*   **Basic:** These students have some grasp of order of operations but might still be shaky on addition/subtraction vs. multiplication. The correct answer (B) is a good chance.
*   **Proficient:** Most students at this level will have a good understanding of order of operations and would choose the correct answer (B). A few might still make a careless mistake.
*   **Advanced:** Advanced students should almost certainly get this correct. The question is a straightforward application of order of operations. A and D may snag one or two who skip the correct answer too blithely thinking it is a pattern recognition question.
