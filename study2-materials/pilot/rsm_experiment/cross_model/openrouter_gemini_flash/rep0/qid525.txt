Here's my prediction of how students at different ability levels would perform on this question, along with my reasoning:

The question tests the addition of mixed numbers, requiring a common denominator. The options are designed to capture common errors.

*   **Option A:** Incorrectly converting the mixed number to an improper fraction.
*   **Option B:** Correct answer.
*   **Option C:** Incorrectly adding the denominators only.
*   **Option D:** Adding the whole numbers and fractions separately but not simplifying the resulting fraction, but making a strange error in adding the fractions

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=75% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
