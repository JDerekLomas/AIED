Here's my prediction for student responses, broken down by ability level:

**Understanding the Question:**

This question tests Order of Operations (BIDMAS/PEMDAS). The key trap is the lack of parentheses around the left side, meaning division happens *before* addition on the left, but after on the right.

**below_basic:** A=15% B=30% C=40% D=15%
*   Students at this level likely struggle with order of operations. Many will simply add 8 and 12 first on *both* sides, then divide by 4 getting 5 on both sides and selecting C (=). Others will guess randomly. The large number of students picking B indicates a tendency to perform operations from left to right without considering order of operations at all.

**basic:** A=25% B=25% C=40% D=10%
*   These students have some awareness of order of operations, but inconsistently applied. They may still be prone to adding before dividing, especially on the left side where the lack of brackets is less obvious to this misunderstanding. Some students might correctly calculate the left side but still mess up the right, or vice versa which would lead to A, B, or C.

**proficient:** A=5% B=70% C=15% D=10%
*   Most students at this level will reliably apply the correct order of operations. A larger percentage will be able to focus soley on applying correct order of operations and selecting the right choice, B. Some might still make a careless calculation error. D might be chosen if a student is unsure what to choose between B or C, but knows it cannot be A.

**advanced:** A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%
*   Students at this level should confidently and correctly apply the order of operations. The vast majority will get this right. Only careless errors, or misreading the question, would lead to incorrect answers. Some students might pick D because they see it as "more correct" than just "<" due to including the option for equality, but only a very small amount will pick it.
