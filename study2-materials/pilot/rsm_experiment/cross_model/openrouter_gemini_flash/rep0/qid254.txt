Here's my prediction of student responses, broken down by ability level, along with explanations:

**Reasoning:**

*   **Below Basic:** These students struggle with fundamental arithmetic and order of operations. They might recognize that a mean involves dividing by the number of values *somehow* but might forget to include the 0, and/or not fully understand they have to add all numbers first. They are drawn by the right numbers being present.
*   **Basic:** These students have a partial understanding of the mean but make careless errors with order of operations, or may also fail to include the 0. They are progressing but easily miss steps.
*   **Proficient:** These students understand the concept of the mean but can still me tripped up by the lack of brackets in option B, leading to an incorrect order of operations. They need to read accurately.
*   **Advanced:** These students have a strong grasp of the mean and order of operations. They will quickly evaluate each option and recognize the importance of the zero.

**Prediction:**

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%
