Here's my prediction of student responses, broken down by ability level, considering the nuances of this particular question:

below_basic: A=15% B=35% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%

Explanation:

*   **Correct Answer:** A. We have to substitute x=0.3 into y=3x^2 to get y = 3 * (0.3)^2 = 3 * 0.09 = 0.27. However, for the answer, this is a second step to calculating 3 * the square of x.

*   **below_basic:** Students at this level will struggle to correctly process the squared term. They might attempt to multiply 3 by 0.3 directly or make errors with decimal arithmetic. B is the most enticing wrong answer since it represents 3*0.3*0.3; students may calculate 3*0.3 as first step, and then see it again in multiplying (0.3)^2. Students might add values to each other. They are liable to decimal calculation and squaring errors.

*   **basic:** Basic students will understand the substitution, but are prone to decimal calculation errors. Many will correctly square 0.3 to get 0.09, but then may still struggle to multiply by 3. Again, B is close to potentially attracting students that do part of the calculation, or think 3(x^2) = (3x)^2. D is attractive to those that do 3x.

*   **proficient:** Most students at the proficient level will have the skills to complete the whole question correctly. The arithmetic is not especially difficult, and students who are confident with core algebra will nail this question.

*   **advanced:** Advanced students should not struggle with this question at all. The percentage choosing A will be very high. They're very likely to get this correct without hesitation.
