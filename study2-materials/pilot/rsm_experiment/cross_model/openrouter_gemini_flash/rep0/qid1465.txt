Here's my breakdown of how students at different ability levels would likely approach this question:

**below_basic:** These students often struggle with order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). Many will perform the operations from left to right, and also struggle with negative numbers. They will perform the operations in the incorrect order and likely get the incorrect answer.
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%

**basic:** These students have some awareness of order of operations but may still make mistakes if they rush or aren't fully confident. They may correctly perform the multiplication but make sign errors with the subtraction and addition, or do the addition/subtraction the wrong way around.
basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%

**proficient:** Most in this group should get it correct. They understand and apply the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) and should be comfortable with integer arithmetic. Some may still rush though and therefore make a mistake.
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%

**advanced:** These students have a strong understanding of mathematical concepts and should easily solve this problem.
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%
