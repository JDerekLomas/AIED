Here's my prediction of how students across different ability levels would perform on this question, considering its specific features:

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%

Reasoning:

*   **below_basic:** These students struggle with algebraic manipulation. Many will misunderstand and choose option A because Tom's method of adding 5 to both sides is a starting point that they understand. Some may opt for Katie due to the single multiplication step, but confusion around fractions and operations will cause mistakes. They may also guess D if stuck.

*   **basic:** These students have some basic understanding of algebraic manipulation, adding 5 is easier for them to see and correctly eliminate Katie. However, they may not recognise both are correct due to difficulty understanding the variety of valid methods.

*   **proficient:** These students understand algebraic manipulations well. They will be able to see that adding 5 to both sides initially is correct, as is multiplying the entire equation by 3. They are likely to understand that there are many routes to the correct answer.

*   **advanced:** These students have a firm grasp of algebra and will likely be able to quickly identify both steps as valid. They are familiar with the concept of multiple valid approaches to solving equations. The question is relatively trivial for them.

The key here is that the question isn't testing a classic misconception directly, but rather understanding the *equivalence* of different valid steps in solving an equation. This makes it slightly harder than a simple 'solve this equation' question, particularly for lower-ability students. Also, the number choices are designed to not specifically favour one approach over the other, increasing the complexity for struggling students.
