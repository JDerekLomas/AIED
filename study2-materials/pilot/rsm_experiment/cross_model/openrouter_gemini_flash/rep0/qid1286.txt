Here's my prediction of student responses, based on ability level, for the sphere volume question:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=30% D=45%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=40% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%

Reasoning:

*   **below_basic:** Students at this level will likely struggle with rearranging formulas and cube roots. Many will guess or choose an option based on familiar numbers in the volume formula (3 and 4). Option D is the most complicated looking (with nested fractions and cube roots) and this complexity, combined with the presence of '3' and '4' will draw them in. They may recall seeing 4 in the volume formula, confusing which value belongs where.

*   **basic:** These students have a slightly better grasp of formula manipulation but are still prone to errors. They might recognize the need to rearrange something to isolate *r*, but make mistakes in the process. Option C is the closest and requires correct understanding, this leads some to choose option A, as it also contains all the correct elements but incorrect placement. The complexity of option D will continue to attract some students.

*   **proficient:** Students at this level generally understand the volume formula and can manipulate algebraic equations with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The major error here would be to confuse the correct formula from their formula sheet by not remembering the 4/3 placement in the equation, however knowing that 4 and 3 are in the original equation will still allow them to pick the correct choice. This combined with an ability to rearrange it correctly will help them to find the right answer, but there will be some careless calculation/rearrangement error as there are cube roots involved.

*   **advanced:** These students are highly confident in their algebraic skills and understanding of the volume formula. They will rearrange the formula accurately and quickly. Option C and D are the only choices that have 3/4, meaning this will be their area of focus. Few will make any errors.
