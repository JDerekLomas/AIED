Here's my prediction of how students at different ability levels would answer this question.

This question directly tests the understanding of how division and brackets interact in algebraic notation, essentially assessing their understanding of order of operations and fraction representation. It's a fairly straightforward question *if* the student understands that a division over the entire bracketed term means that the bracketed term becomes the denominator.

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=3% C=5% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
