Here's my prediction of student responses, based on experience and common misconceptions:

**Reasoning:**

*   **The Goal:** The question tests the ability to substitute values into an equation and solve for an unknown. It appears simple, but the initial presence of a star instead of y=0 might cause some students to trip up. The presence of a decimal answer also acts as a distractor, leading some to select it without appropriate calculation.

*   **below_basic:** These students struggle with basic algebra. A significant portion may simply guess or misinterpret the question, likely thinking 4x+2 is the main element of the table. Students may pick A by substituting x=0 into '4x+2y = something a bit wrong' and getting 20 as a number that "feels" right. Given the table context, some might opt for C (5) as a midpoint. B might be chosen randomly.
*   **basic:** Students here can likely plug in x=0 but may falter in solving the equation, may perform arithmetic errors or not complete algebraic manipulation correctly. Many will correctly substitute x=0 into the equation. However, some will struggle to divide 10 by 2.
*   **proficient:** These students can almost certainly substitute and solve. Distractors shouldn't overly affect this cohort.
*   **advanced:** These students will find it an easy quick win.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=45% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=70% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%
