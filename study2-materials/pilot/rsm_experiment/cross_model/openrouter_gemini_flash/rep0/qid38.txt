Here's my prediction of student responses, broken down by ability level.

**Reasoning:**

This question tests adding fractions with algebraic denominators. The key is recognising that the denominators need to be the same before adding the numerators. The question is relatively straightforward because the denominators are multiples of each other, making finding a common denominator easy. The biggest mistake I anticipate is students incorrectly adding numerators and denominators, or not understanding that they need to get a common denominator.

*   **Below Basic:** These students likely struggle with fraction manipulation in general. Many will probably add numerators and denominators directly, resulting in option B. Some might randomly pick an answer, and a few may try to find a common denominator but make calculation errors.
*   **Basic:** These students have some understanding of fractions, but they may still not fully grasp the concept of a common denominator. A significant proportion will choose option B by adding numerators and denominators. Some may try to make the denominators the same, but make mistakes along the way perhaps multiplying only the numerator or only the denominator by 2 in the second fraction.
*   **Proficient:** These students generally understand how to work with fractions. Most will be able to find a common denominator and correctly add the fractions, correctly arriving at A. There is still room for error in the basic arithmetic.
*   **Advanced:** These students will almost certainly get the correct answer via proper method. The question is a relatively straightforward application of fraction rules.

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=35% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%
