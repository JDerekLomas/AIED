Here's my prediction of student responses, based on experience teaching similar questions in the UK:

below_basic: A=15% B=35% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=55% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=2% D=13%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%

Explanation:

The key misconception here is whether to multiply or divide to isolate 'p'. Students at lower levels are prone to multiplying 3 by 1/12 instead of dividing. Some might also try manipulating the fraction incorrectly.

*   **Below Basic:** I predict a significant chunk of students will choose options A, C, and D. Option A is dividing 12 by 3.. Option C stems from the misconception of multiplying and not understanding fraction notation. Option D might arise from confusing multiplying by 3 instead of dividing. The correct answer, B, will likely be chosen by a smaller group who perhaps guess correctly or have a partial understanding.

*   **Basic:** Students will have higher success rates on this question. However, a noticeable chunk might still choose D (from multiplying the numerator by 3) which is similar to multiplying by 3.

*   **Proficient:** Most students at this level should get this correct. There will still be a few careless errors.

*   **Advanced:** Almost all students should solve this without errors. Very few would fall for the distraction options.
