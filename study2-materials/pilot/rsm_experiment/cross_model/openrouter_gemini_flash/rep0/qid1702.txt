Here's my prediction of student responses across different ability levels.

The question requires substitution and rearrangement of a linear equation. The use of a decimal (0.5) might make it slightly harder, but it is still a fairly accessible question overall. The potential error lies in either substituting incorrectly or in incorrectly rearranging the equation to solve for *x*.
