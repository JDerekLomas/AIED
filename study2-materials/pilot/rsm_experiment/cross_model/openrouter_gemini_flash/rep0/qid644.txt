Here's my prediction of how students at different ability levels would perform on this question, considering the specific details of the problem:

**Rationale:**

The question targets a very specific part of expanding brackets: multiplying two negative constants. The common errors would stem from either ignoring the negative signs altogether or making a mistake when multiplying them (e.g., -1 - 4 instead of -1 x -4).

*   **Below Basic:** These students struggle with basic arithmetic involving negative numbers. They might not understand the concept of multiplying negative numbers, and many will likely ignore the negative signs altogether. The attraction of +5 or -5 (adding -1 and -4) will also be high.

*   **Basic:** These students have some understanding of negative numbers but are prone to making careless errors. They might know a negative times a negative is a positive but may still slip up. Some will still be drawn to adding -1 and -4.

*   **Proficient:** These students generally understand the rules of multiplying negative numbers. They are likely to arrive at the correct answer (+4). Careless errors will be minimal.

*   **Advanced:** These students will almost certainly get this question correct. They have a strong understanding of signed number arithmetic.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
