Here's my prediction of student responses, broken down by ability level.

**Rationale:**

This question is straightforward and tests basic substitution and rearranging of an equation. The potential difficulties lie in correctly substituting y = 0.5 and then rearranging the equation to solve for x. Negative signs and decimals (0.5 * -6 = -3) could present minor challenges, but overall, the arithmetic is quite manageable.

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level struggle with substitution and algebraic manipulation. They may not know where to substitute the given value or may make errors in arithmetic when attempting to solve for x. Some might guess randomly or work with the numbers presented in a way that doesn't make mathematical sense.

*   **Basic:** These students can generally substitute correctly but may make errors in rearranging the equation or in their arithmetic. The negative sign in '-6y' is a common source of error. Even after substituting the value into the linear equation, the manipulation to isolate x could be another stumbling block because of the fractions.

*   **Proficient:** Proficient students can usually substitute and rearrange equations correctly. They might make a minor arithmetic error in the rearrangement but would likely catch it with a quick re-check.

*   **Advanced:** Advanced students will find this question very easy. They'll substitute, rearrange, and solve quickly and accurately.

**Predicted Response Distribution:**

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=10% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=2% D=2%

**Explanation of Choices**

*   **A (4.25):** Is the correct answer. Substituting y = 0.5 into 10x - 6y = 30 gives 10x - 6(0.5) = 30 => 10x - 3 = 30 => 10x = 33 => x = 3.3/10=3.3
*   **B (-4.25):** Students might get confused with negative signs and/or equation manipulation and produce an incorrect negative value.
*   **C (3.3):** Students may forget to divide by 10 when isolating x, thus leading to x=33
*   **D (2.7):** Students in the lowest ability range may attempt random calculations with the numbers given in the problem.
