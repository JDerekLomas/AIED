Here's my prediction of student responses, broken down by ability level, and the reasoning behind those predictions:

This question is designed to test powers and how negative signs interact with them. The potential error stems from incorrectly handling the negative sign when raising -3 to the power of 4.

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=35% D=15%
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level struggle significantly with powers and negative numbers. Many will incorrectly calculate -3 to the power 4. Some may get 81 but assume it is negative regardless of the exponent. A sizable chunk won't know where to begin and select an option at random. I've included a significant percentage incorrectly opting for a negative answer.

basic: A=55% B=15% C=20% D=10%
*   **Reasoning:** Students at this level have some understanding of evaluating expressions, But the negative sign can still cause errors. They may know the process but make computational errors. The majority, though, should recognize this is a straightforward substitution question. Option B and D are not easily created from errors so should be less common.

proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
*   **Reasoning:** Most proficient students will realize this is a straightforward substitution. The dominant error would be in carelessness or rushing, leading to a negative sign oversight (although the fact that positive 81 appears as an option should hint to students checking their work).

advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
*   **Reasoning:** Advanced students will reliably get this correct quickly and accurately. Any errors are negligible.
