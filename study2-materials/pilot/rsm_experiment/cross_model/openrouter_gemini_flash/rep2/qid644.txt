Here's my prediction of how students at different ability levels would perform on this question, based on my experience as a UK maths teacher:

This question specifically tests the multiplication of two negative numbers, a common source of error. It is a relatively straightforward procedural question, assuming students understand the distributive property (even if not fully).

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
