Here's my prediction of student responses, broken down by ability level:

**Rationale:**

*   **The Formula:** The formula for the volume of a sphere, \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), needs to be rearranged to solve for *r*. This is the main hurdle. Students need to (a) recall the correct volume formula and (b) accurately manipulate the equation.
*   **Cube Root:** The cube root adds another layer of complexity, as students sometimes struggle with algebraic manipulation when roots or powers are involved.
*   **Distractors:** The distractors are designed to catch common errors in the algebraic manipulation. Option A inverts the formula twice, option B and D are attempting to invert the fraction.

**Predicted Responses:**

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=10% B=25% C=40% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=90% D=5%
