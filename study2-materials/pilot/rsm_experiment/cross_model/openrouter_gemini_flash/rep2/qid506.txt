Here's my prediction of student responses, considering common misconceptions and the specific numbers involved:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=10% D=45%
basic: A=10% B=50% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=2% D=13%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%

Explanation:

*   **Correct Answer:** B (\(p = \frac{1}{36}\)) To solve for \(p\), divide both sides of the equation by 3: \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\)

*   **Why this question is easier/harder than it looks:** The fraction makes it a bit trickier than a simple '3p = 6' type question. The most obvious error is multiplying by 3 instead of dividing, leading to the distractors that are closest to the correct answer.

*   **below_basic:** Many will struggle with the concept of dealing with the fraction and misunderstanding division. Many could choose D because 3 x 12 = 36, they see a connection and that number in the original expression. Students choosing A may have used a "guess and check" mentality - seeing that 1/4 multiplied by 3 gets them close to 1/12.
*   **basic:** A significant proportion will still struggle with dividing by 3 correctly when a fraction is involved. They might try to divide the 12 by 3 (instead of multiplying 12 x 3 for the denominator) or get confused with the manipulations. Students may choose D because 3 x 12 = 36, they see a connection and that number in the original expression.
*   **proficient:** Most should be able to handle the division of a fraction. Mistakes are less likely but can happen due to careless errors.
*   **advanced:** These students should confidently solve the equation with ease. Occasional silly mistakes are still possible, explaining the small percentages on other answers.
