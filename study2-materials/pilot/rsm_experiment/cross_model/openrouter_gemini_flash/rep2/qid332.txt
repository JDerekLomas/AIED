Here's my prediction for how students of different ability levels would answer this question, based on its specific characteristics:

*   **Question Analysis:**

    The key here is understanding order of operations and inverse operations. Tom correctly isolates the x/3 term by adding 5 to both sides. Katie correctly multiplies every term by 3. Both are valid first steps. The relative difficulty depends on the student's comfort with fractions and equation manipulation. The wording is quite explicit ("a correct *next* line of working"), so students likely won't feel pressured to fully solve.
