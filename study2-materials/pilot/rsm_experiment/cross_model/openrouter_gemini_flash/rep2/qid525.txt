Here's my prediction of student responses, based on experience teaching similar content:

**Analysis:**

This question tests adding mixed numbers, including the need to find a common denominator and simplify the resulting fraction. It's harder than a straight addition of fractions question because of the mixed numbers. The distractors are designed to appeal to common errors:

*   **A) \(\frac{99}{20}\):** This is the correct answer expressed as an improper fraction. Some students might correctly calculate the answer but fail to convert it to a mixed number.
*   **B) \(4 \frac{19}{20}\):** This is the correct answer expressed as a mixed number.
*   **C) \(\frac{99}{40}\):** This could arise if students add the denominators together (10 + 4 = 14, then double to get 28 - not even 40!) or miscalculate the common denominator and numerator. It's also larger than the other improper fraction, making it less likely to be chosen by those who get to the final calculation.
*   **D) \(4 \frac{8}{14}\):** This distractor is designed to catch students who add the numerators and denominators separately: (7+1)/(10+4) = 8/14. They correctly add the whole numbers (2+2=4). This simplification to 4/7 is another common error.
