Here's my prediction for student responses based on ability level:

**Reasoning:**

This question tests understanding of order of operations (BIDMAS/PEMDAS). The key is whether students correctly perform the division before the addition on the left side of the inequality. The right side requires correct parenthetical calculation.

*   **Below Basic:** These students likely have a weak grasp of order of operations. Many will perform the calculations from left to right on both sides, leading them to incorrect answers. A significant portion will completely ignore the order of operations and do calculations left to right, or guess randomly.
*   **Basic:** These students will have some idea of the order of operations but might stumble. Many might correctly remember division should come before addition on the left, but may still make arithmetical errors. Understanding the parenthesis on the right will also be key.
*   **Proficient:** These students should largely understand and apply the order of operations correctly. They are less likely to make arithmetic errors.
*   **Advanced:** These students should confidently and correctly apply the order of operations. They are unlikely to make errors. The distractor D will hopefully be almost ignored.

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=5% B=40% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=10% C=85% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=97% D=0%
