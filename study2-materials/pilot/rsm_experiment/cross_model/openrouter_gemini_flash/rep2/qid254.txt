Here's my prediction of how students at different ability levels would answer this question, and the justification:

**Reasoning:**

*   **Core Concept:** The question tests understanding of the definition of the mean (average): sum of values divided by the number of values. Also, order of operations (BIDMAS/PEMDAS).
*   **Potential Errors:**
    *   **Forgetting to include 0:** This is tested by options A and C.
    *   **Order of Operations:** Option B is designed to trick students who don't understand or forget the order of operations.
    *   **Just checking:** Option D tests if they are just reading and not doing.

**Predicted Response Distribution:**

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%

**Explanation of Predictions:**

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with both the concept of the mean *and* order of operations. Many will see the numbers 1, 3, 4, and 7 and try to directly use them. A significant proportion will mess up the order of operations in Option B and simply calculate 7 / 5 first, coming to a wrong conclusion . Also, some may not include the 0.
*   **Basic:** Most students here will know the fundamental idea of adding and dividing. The most significant error will be from the temptation of Option B. They might perform the division before summing due to order of operation errors.
*   **Proficient:** These students are generally confident with the mean calculation. A very small number might make a careless error with the division in option B, but the majority will recognize the correct setup.
*   **Advanced:** These students will quickly and accurately identify the correct answer due to their strong understanding of mathematical operations and concepts. They are less likely to make careless mistakes.
