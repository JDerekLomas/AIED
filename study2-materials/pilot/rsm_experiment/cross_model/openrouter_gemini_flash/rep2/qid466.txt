Here's my prediction for student responses to the question, broken down by ability level:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%

Reasoning:

*   **Understanding the Question:** The core concept here is understanding how to solve a simple algebraic equation involving multiplication of fractions, and the rules of signs. The question tests the ability to isolate the variable and perform the inverse operation.

*   **Common Errors:**
    *   **Sign Errors:** The main error students will make is forgetting to consider the negative signs. Many will correctly find the reciprocal but not realise it has to be positive because multiplying two negatives makes a positive.
    *   **Reciprocal confusion:** Some students may struggle with the concept of reciprocals and how they relate to division or inverse operations.
    *   **Misunderstanding of the Operation:** Some might struggle with conceptualising the question: thinking *"What do I multiply by -3/4 to get -1?"*

*   **Ability Level Breakdown:**

    *   **Below Basic:** These students will likely guess or make common mistakes. They might not understand how to isolate the star, or they might confuse multiplication and division. I predict there would be some focus on C and D, as there numbers in the question. This group has the highest percentage of guessing.

    *   **Basic:** Basic students likely remember the idea of reciprocals, and are able to isolate the star. The main thing that will hold them back is the negative signs. They will likely get mixed up, and forget to include it. A will be the most common response, due to the reciprocal being correct, with the negative sign neglected.

    *   **Proficient:** These students generally understand reciprocals and sign rules. They likely know they need to multiply the fraction by its reciprocal, and that they need to positive answer. They should be able to do it correctly.

    *   **Advanced:** Advanced students will almost certainly get this correct. They have a strong understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts. Most who get it wrong will make very small errors in calculations and understanding of the question.
