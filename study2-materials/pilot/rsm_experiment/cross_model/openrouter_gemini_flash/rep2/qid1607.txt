Here's my prediction of how students would perform on this question, broken down by ability level.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Overall Difficulty:** This question is relatively straightforward. The core concept is solving a simple linear equation with a fraction. The potential error lies in simple arithmetic mistakes during the manipulation. The structure of the algebra is not particularly complex. The numbers have been chosen carefully to make step by step working clear (e.g. 15 * 4 = 60)

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level struggle with even basic algebraic manipulations. They may not understand the order of operations needed or how to isolate the variable. They are likely to make arithmetic errors too. They are not likely to evaluate the correctness of the steps, selecting an answer at random. Since step 1 is actually correct, option A may appear the most compelling, albeit incorrect.

*   **Basic:** Students at this level may understand the basic principles of solving equations but are prone to making arithmetic errors, especially when multiplying fractions or adding/subtracting. They might be tempted by option B if they only glance at the second step and don't perform the calculation themselves. There is a chance that these students consider that step 1 looks to be correct, but when they continue to solve, they miscalculate.

*   **Proficient:** These students will generally be able to solve the equation correctly. They'll recognize that step 1 is correct and step 2 is incorrect. They may make a careless arithmetic mistake, but it's less likely.

*   **Advanced:** Advanced students will solve the equation quickly and accurately. They will easily identify the correct step and the incorrect step. They are extremely unlikely to make any mistakes.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%
