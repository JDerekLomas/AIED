Here's a breakdown of how I expect students of different ability levels to approach this question, considering the nuances of the specific calculations involved:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
*Explanation:* Below basic students struggle with order of operations consistently. For Problem P, they may know to work left to right, but struggle to actually work out what bit they should do first. For Problem Q, they're likely to just go left to right, but might simply guess.

basic: A=20% B=50% C=10% D=20%
*Explanation:* Basic students are more likely to remember the order of operations (BIDMAS/PEMDAS) and prioritize multiplication for Problem Q. They likely get Problem P correct. An error is in confusing the symbols, knowing Order of calculations, but getting their + and - signs muddled up

proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
*Explanation:* Proficient students generally understand the order of operations. They'll confidently identify \(5 \times 6\) as the first operation in Problem Q. For Problem P, they know in the absence of brackets/indices/division/multiplication, you work from left to right because addition and subtraction are of equal priority. Some might be tempted by working right to left for subtraction.

advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
*Explanation:* Advanced students will almost certainly get this correct without hesitation. They have a strong understanding of order of operations and are unlikely to make careless errors. They understand the left-to-right convention for addition and subtraction.
