Here's my prediction of how students at different attainment levels would answer this question:

**Reasoning:**

*   **Overall Difficulty:** This question is designed to be relatively straightforward. It tests the basic addition of mixed numbers with common denominators. The "leave your answer as a mixed number" part directs them to the correct form, which should help.
*   **Common Errors:** The most likely errors will come from difficulties with fraction arithmetic, specifically with adding the fractional parts and accidentally adding the denominators, or misunderstanding what a mixed number represents. Some may convert to improper fractions but fail to convert back.
*   **Distractor Analysis:**
    *   A) \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \) is the correct answer.
    *   B) \( \frac{18}{5} \) is the correct answer written as an improper fraction - not a mixed number. A student who correctly adds them, but ignores the question, will select this
    *   C) \( \frac{18}{10} \) results from adding the numerators and denominators, showing a misunderstanding of fraction addition.
    *   D) \( 3 \frac{3}{10} \) results from adding the whole numbers correctly but incorrectly adding the numerators and denominators of the fractions.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
