Here's my prediction of how UK students across different ability levels would perform on this question, considering common algebraic misconceptions and question-specific features:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%

**Reasoning:**

*   **Overall Difficulty:** This question is relatively straightforward for students who understand algebraic conventions. The use of simple variables and numbers reduces the chance of arithmetic errors obscuring the conceptual understanding. However, the potential for misinterpreting the order of operations involved in division and expressions in brackets is present.

*   **Option A (Correct):** This is the correct representation of the given expression.

*   **Option B:** This option plays on the misconception of unnecessarily combining/cancelling parts of brackets, but is sufficiently nonsensical that even weaker candidates knowing some algebra would dismiss it.

*   **Option C:** This is plausible error arising from misunderstanding that division applies to the WHOLE bracket expression. This would be selected by students not applying order of operations correctly (incorrect distribution of the division).

*   **Option D:** This option completely inverts the expression and is likely only chosen by students guessing or with no algebraic understanding.

*   **Ability Level Breakdown:**

    *   **Below Basic:** These students struggle with order of operations and basic algebraic manipulation. Many are essentially guessing, but there will be some preference for answers that look familiar, hence higher chance of a,c, and d but not b.
    *   **Basic:** Students at this level have a rudimentary understanding of algebra. They should be able to identify that division represents a fraction. But the order of operations with the bracket could be a problem.
    *   **Proficient:** Most students at this level understand fractional representation of division and applying the correct order of operations, meaning they will select A. A few may still make errors.
    *   **Advanced:** These students will almost certainly get this question correct. They have a strong command of algebraic conventions. The small percentage choosing other options are due to occasional careless errors or misreading the question.
