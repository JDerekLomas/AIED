Here's my analysis of the question and predicted student responses at different ability levels:

**Analysis of the Question**

This question tests the addition of algebraic fractions. The common misconception is adding the numerators and denominators separately (leading to option B). However, this specific question is relatively straightforward because:

*   **Basic Algebra:** It only involves a single variable, 'x'.
*   **Easy Common Denominator:** Finding the common denominator is relatively simple; the student only needs to alter one fraction.
*   **Clear Process:** Students are likely to remember setting up a common denominator when adding fractions.

**below_basic:** A=35% B=20% C=15% D=30%

*   Students at this level struggle with fraction manipulation in general. Many will guess. Some will "add" across. The '2x' in the denominator is likely to confuse them, so they will be spread across options. A is a relatively good guess if they add the numerators but fudge the denominator somehow. D is appealing because it's the most superficially similar. C requires too much manipulation.

**basic:** A=50% B=10% C=10% D=30%

*   These students often remember the rule about getting a common denominator, but may make arithmetic errors (e.g., multiplying only the '4' by 2 in option A). They are still vulnerable to misconceptions involving adding numerators and denominators directly, but less so than the "below basic". The correct answer is a plausible looking answer, but may not be reached since it requires manipulation of one of the fraction terms.

**proficient:** A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%

*   Proficient students understand that the common denominator must be explicitly obtained. They can confidently handle multiplying the second fraction. The most likely errors are silly arithmetic mistakes when dealing with the numerators or forgetting they need to multiply the numerator of the second fraction. It is less likely they will add across.

**advanced:** A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%

*   These students will breeze through this question. Any errors will be careless and rare. Option D is more plausible than B or C as an error candidate.
