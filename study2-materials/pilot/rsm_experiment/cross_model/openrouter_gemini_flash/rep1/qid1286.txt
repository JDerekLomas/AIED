Here's my prediction of how students at different ability levels would perform on this question:

**Understanding the Question and Potential Difficulties**

The question requires students to rearrange the formula for the volume of a sphere to find the radius. The major difficulty lies in:

1.  **Remembering the Volume Formula:** Students need to recall that the volume of a sphere is given by  V = (4/3)πr³.
2.  **Rearranging the Formula:** Solving for 'r' involves multiplying by 3/4π and then taking the cube root.
3.  **Algebraic Manipulation:** The expression under the cube root needs to be correctly manipulated.

Let's break down the predictions:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=30% D=45%
basic: A=15% B=25% C=40% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%

**Reasoning for the Predictions:**

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level likely struggle with formula recall and algebraic manipulation. They might guess randomly or be attracted to options that vaguely resemble parts of the volume formula. Option D is a likely distractor since it features 3, V, and 4pi, numbers featured in the formula for the volume of a sphere

*   **Basic:** These students might remember some of the formula. However, rearrangement is still challenging. Students will be most likely to get confused and pick option C.

*   **Proficient:** Students at this level generally have good formula recall and can often manipulate algebraic expressions, although they may make minor mistakes. Option C is the correct answer.

*   **Advanced:** These students should find the question straightforward and be able to correctly rearrange the formula with minimal errors. Option C is the correct answer.
