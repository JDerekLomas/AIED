Here's my prediction for how students of varying abilities would perform on this question:

**Reasoning:**

This question assesses the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). The key operation here is the multiplication. Common errors include:

*   **Incorrect Order:** Students might perform the addition and subtraction from left to right *before* addressing the multiplication.
*   **Negative Number Errors:** Students might struggle to correctly deal with the negative number.

Here's a breakdown by ability level:

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level likely lack a solid understanding of the order of operations. They will struggle to identify the correct first step. They'll most likely go left-to-right. The negative sign will throw them off as well.
*   **Basic:** These students have *some* awareness of the order of operations but apply it inconsistently. They may correctly identify the multiplication but still make arithmetic errors with the negative numbers.
*   **Proficient:** These students understand the order of operations and can execute the calculation correctly with minimal errors. Some may be caught off guard by the layout and do 3 - 5 first.
*   **Advanced:** These students have a strong grasp of the order of operations and are unlikely to make mistakes. They can perform the calculation accurately and efficiently.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
