Here's my prediction of how students at different ability levels would respond to this question:

The question is about adding mixed numbers. The numbers used are simple, both fractions have the same denominator, and the options are presented as both mixed numbers and improper fractions. The biggest potential error is incorrect addition of fractions combined with confusion between the numerator and denominator, so potentially leading to denominator being inappropriately added. Converting to improper fractions is likely to be another source of error for students who struggle with arithmetic. The question explicitly asks for the answer to be expressed as a mixed number which should eliminate converting to improper fractions as a valid choice. This question tests a fundamental arithmetic skill, so it differentiates between the ability groups.

basic: A=65% B=15% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
