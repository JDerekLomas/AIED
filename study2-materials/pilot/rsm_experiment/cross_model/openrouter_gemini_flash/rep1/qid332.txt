Here's a breakdown of how I think students at different ability levels would approach this question, and the likely distribution of their answers:

**Reasoning:**

*   **The Question's Difficulty:** This question is designed to assess understanding of inverse operations when solving linear equations. It's not overly complex arithmetically and presents two alternative 'next steps', making it moderately tricky. The trick is recognizing that both steps are valid, just achieved through different (yet correct) algebraic manipulations.
*   **Tom's Method:** Tom correctly adds 5 to both sides. This is often the first approach students learn.
*   **Katie's Method:** Katie correctly multiplies both sides by 3.

**Predicted Response Distribution:**

below_basic: A=35% B=30% C=10% D=25%
*   Below basic students struggle to grasp the underlying operations.
*   They might try to solve it and get confused. They are likely to guess or latch onto one method (often Tom's as it's a more 'standard' initial step for them).
* A and B will be the most common, guessing either Tom or Katie.

basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
* Basic students can perform basic inverse operations but might struggle with multiple valid approaches depending on where they focus their algebraic manipulation.
* Focus on isolating x and a bias towards Tom's approach leads to A being the most popular answer.
* However, the wording will suggest that option B is also potentially viable.
* Some will feel uneasy and think that they have made a mistake somewhere, hence opting for D.

proficient: A=15% B=5% C=70% D=10%
*   Proficient students are comfortable with algebraic manipulation. They'll see that both methods are valid ways to start solving the equation.
* The question contains nothing that would suggest the 'wrong' answer, so is likely to generate the correct response.
* Fewer will get tricked into only recognising a single approach as correct..

advanced: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%
*   Advanced students will ace this. They have a strong understanding of algebraic manipulation and will immediately recognize both steps as correct.
* A few might overthink it and assume there's a hidden trick, but most will choose C.
