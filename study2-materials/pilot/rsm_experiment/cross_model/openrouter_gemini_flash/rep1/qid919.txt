Here's my prediction of how students at different ability levels would answer this question, along with my reasoning:

The key to this question is order of operations and decimal arithmetic. Students need to correctly substitute x = 0.3 into the equation and then evaluate the expression, remembering to square 0.3 *before* multiplying by 3.

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=20% D=20%
*Reasoning:* Below basic students will struggle with the substitution and order of operations. A common error will be to multiply 3 by 0.3 first, then square the result or square only the 3. These students might pick C (3 * 0.3 * 2 ) or D (3*.3 = .9 -> 3*.9 = 2.7). They may also get confused and simply square 0.9 getting .81 (A). Option B would be obtained by calculating 3 * 0.3^2 as instead of 3*(0.3)^2 as (3*.3)^2.

basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
*Reasoning:* Basic students are more likely to understand that substitution is needed but may still get confused with order of operations. They are more likely to attempt to do a little bit of the calculation, increasing the chance of simple errors. They are more likely to pick the correct method than lower attaining pupils. This group will still contain some students who make errors like multiplying before squaring, making option D or C plausible and a considerable mistake from misunderstanding the nature of squares (.81). Option B comes from incorrect squaring, squaring the result of 3*0.3

proficient: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
*Reasoning:* Proficient students understand the order of operations, but arithmetic errors with decimals are still possible. The majority should get this correct however. Some might still multiply before squaring, but this is less likely.

advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2.5% D=2.5%
*Reasoning:* Advanced students are very likely to answer this correctly, demonstrating a solid understanding of algebraic substitution and accurate calculations. A few careless errors are possible.
