Here's my prediction for how students at different ability levels would answer the question, along with my reasoning:

**Reasoning:**

*   **Common Errors:** The most common error is likely to be with the signs when multiplying -5 and -7, and when adding -5 and -7. Students might forget that a negative times a negative is a positive, resulting in the wrong sign for the constant term (35), or mess up the addition of two negative numbers resulting in an incorrect coefficient for the m term.
*   **Easy aspects:** The presence of 'm' alone (without coefficients > 1) should make the FOIL process and multiplication slightly less daunting.
*   **Error targeting:** Option A targets students that make errors related to not handling the (-)*(+) with the added numbers i.e. sum (-5) + (-7) incorrectly.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
