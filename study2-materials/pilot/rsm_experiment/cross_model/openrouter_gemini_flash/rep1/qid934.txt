Here's my prediction of student responses to the question across different ability levels, considering the specific characteristics of the problem:

**Reasoning:**

*   **Below Basic:** These students will likely struggle with the basic concept of substituting values into an equation. Many will guess randomly. Some might attempt to substitute x=0 into the equation but struggle with the algebra, or misinterpret the question entirely. A significant portion might pick A because it contains a large number, or C, as there are "5"s in the equation.

*   **Basic:** These students can likely substitute x=0 into the equation. However, the algebraic manipulation (solving for y) may pose a challenge. Mistakes might include incorrectly manipulating the equation (e.g., adding instead of subtracting). Some still might be tempted by A or C if they don't fully understand the problem.

*   **Proficient:** Most students at this level should be able to correctly substitute and solve the equation. They understand the concept of a table of values and can perform the algebraic manipulation with high accuracy. Errors are likely to be careless rather than conceptual.

*   **Advanced:** These students will quickly and accurately solve the problem. They have a solid understanding of linear equations and should experience no difficulty with the substitution and solving process.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=25% C=20% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=2% D=95%
