Here's my prediction of student responses, broken down by ability level:

This question tests multiplication of fractions and the rule that a negative times a negative equals a positive. The potentially tricky aspect is getting the sign correct. The reciprocal concept should be familiar, but the negative aspect makes B a more natural trap.

below_basic: A=15% B=40% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=45% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
