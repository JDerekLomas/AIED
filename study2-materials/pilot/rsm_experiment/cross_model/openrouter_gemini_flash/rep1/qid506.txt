Here's my analysis of the question and predicted student responses:

The question tests a very fundamental algebraic skill: solving a simple one-step linear equation involving a fraction. The most likely error is dividing by 3 when they should be multiplying the denominator by 3. A less likely error involves students trying to apply the reciprocal without understanding what they're actually doing.
