Here's my prediction of how students at different ability levels would answer this question, taking into account the specific nature of the equation and potential errors:

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=55% B=15% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%

Explanation:

*   **below_basic:** Students at this level often struggle with multi-step equation solving. Here, many may not understand the initial step of multiplying by 4 to eliminate the fraction. Some will latch on to the fact that there is an error. 40% will pick D
*   **basic:** These students are more likely to understand the correct first step. Recognising step 1 being correct is a likely event. Step 2 creates an additional problem for the student.
*   **proficient:** The majority of proficient students will recognize correct order of operations needed and identify that step 1 is good and step 2 is bad. Few will be lead into an error in this simple question.
*   **advanced:** These students will almost certainly pick the correct answer. The equation is very simple, and order of operations is something they have mastered.
