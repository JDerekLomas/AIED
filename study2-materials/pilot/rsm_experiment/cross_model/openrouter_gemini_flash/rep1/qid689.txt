Here's my prediction of student responses, broken down by ability level.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Difficulty:** This equation is designed to be accessible if approached correctly. However, the presence of the variable in the denominator can induce errors, particularly among lower-ability students. The most common mistake will likely be dividing 5 by 10 instead of correctly manipulating the equation. Confusion could also arise from insufficient understanding of fractions or algebraic manipulation.

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level will likely struggle with the fraction and how to isolate 'p'. Many will intuitively, but incorrectly, divide 5 by 10. Some may simply guess randomly. 'No solutions' may be chosen by those intimidated by the variable in the denominator.

*   **Basic:** Basic students might know that they need to isolate 'p,' but may struggle with the correct operation - dividing 5 by 10 or multiplying by p. Some basic students can also solve it without knowing how to manipulate the equation by trying to determine what value of p makes the fraction 5/p equal to 10.

*   **Proficient:** Proficient students should be able to solve this equation relatively easily. They understand the general principles of algebraic manipulation and should quickly arrive at the right answer. Even if a student initially tries to divide 5 by 10; a proficient student will realize that the value of p should be smaller than 5.

*   **Advanced:** Advanced students will solve this immediately without difficulty.

**Predicted Response Percentages:**

below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=10% C=40% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%
