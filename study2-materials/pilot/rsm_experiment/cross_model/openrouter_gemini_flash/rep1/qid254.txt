Here's my prediction of student responses, broken down by ability level:

**Reasoning:**

*   **Why A is correct and B & C are Incorrect:** Option A is the straightforward correct calculation for the mean. Option B suffers from order of operations errors (division before addition). Option C misses out the 0 and divides by the wrong number.

*   **below_basic:** Students at this level often struggle with basic arithmetic and order of operations. Many will be drawn to option B due to a misunderstanding of how to properly input the calculation into a calculator. Also many will forget to explicitly include the 0, so will get the number of numbers wrong in the denominator.
*   **basic:** Students at this level have some understanding of the mean, however, can be prone to either forgetting to use 0 or ignoring order of operations.
*   **proficient:** These students understand the concept of the mean well, however, might be caught out when choosing between A and none of them. So it is key that they read the question carefully.
*   **advanced:** These students will almost certainly get it correct, either immediately, or after quickly double-checking.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%
