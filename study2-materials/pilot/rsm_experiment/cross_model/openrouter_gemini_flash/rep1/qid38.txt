Here's my prediction for student responses, broken down by ability level, along with justification:

**below_basic:** These students struggle with fraction manipulation and variable terms. They are highly likely to add numerators *and* denominators directly, representing a fundamental misunderstanding.

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%

**basic:** These students have some understanding of adding fractions, but struggle when there are variables involved. They will recognise the need for a common denominator but might not be able to find it correctly. I predict some might add the numerators directly, overlooking the variables in the denominator or might try to cross multiply incorrectly.

basic: A=45% B=20% C=10% D=25%

**proficient:** These students understand fraction operations, but careless errors may creep in, like forgetting to multiply the numerator when finding a common denominator. They should mostly get it right though.

proficient: A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%

**advanced:** These students have a strong understanding of fraction manipulation with variables. They should easily find the common denominator of 2x and correctly add the fractions. Some may not simplify fully.

advanced: A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%
