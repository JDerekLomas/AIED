Here's my prediction of student responses, broken down by ability level:

**Reasoning:**

*   **Question Type:** This question tests the ability to substitute values into a linear equation and solve for an unknown. The fractional value for y adds a layer of potential difficulty for some.
*   **Common Errors:** The most likely error is careless arithmetic when simplifying the equation after substitution.
*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level struggle with algebraic manipulation and may not even attempt substitution. Some might guess randomly. A few might substitute incorrectly or struggle significantly with the arithmetic.
*   **Basic:** These students are somewhat capable. They can usually substitute, but there will be far more arithmetic errors. Some will struggle to solve the resulting simple equation.
*   **Proficient:** These students will generally perform the substitution correctly. The fractional value is also unlikely to be an impediment at these level. The most frequent errors will come from minor arithmetic mistakes.
*   **Advanced:** These students will almost certainly solve this question correctly. There's very little to trip them up here.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=2% D=1%
