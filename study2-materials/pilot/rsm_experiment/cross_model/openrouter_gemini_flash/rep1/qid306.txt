Here's my prediction of student responses, broken down by ability level, along with reasoning:

**Reasoning:**

*   **Problem P:** Order of operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS) dictates that addition and subtraction are performed from left to right. This means 4-5 should be calculated first.
*   **Problem Q:** Order of operations dictates that multiplication is performed before addition. This means 5 x 6 should be calculated first.

**below_basic:** A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%

*   Students at this level likely haven't fully grasped order of operations or struggle with negative numbers. They might guess or perform the operations in the order presented. Given the operations involved are not fractions, they may get 4-5 correct for P. The 'Q' part is where they will struggle because they do not know BEDMAS or PEMDAS.

**basic:** A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%

*   These students have some awareness of order of operations but may still make mistakes, particularly with addition and subtraction. They understand multiplying before adding but are not confident on order of subtraction and addition.

**proficient:** A=10% B=65% C=10% D=15%

*   Proficient students generally understand the order of operations. Most will correctly identify the first steps in both problems. A few may make a careless error, particularly with P.

**advanced:** A=2% B=90% C=3% D=5%

*   Advanced students have a solid grasp of order of operations and are unlikely to make mistakes on this question.
     They may misread the question or make a rare careless error.

**Final Predictions:**

below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=65% C=10% D=15%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=3% D=5%
