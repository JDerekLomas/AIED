Here's my prediction of student responses, based on my experience as a UK maths teacher:

The question focuses on multiplying two negative numbers. It's a discrete skill plucked from the broader context of expanding brackets. The numbers involved are small and easy to work with. The context of expanding brackets might cause *some* distraction, but overall, the question isolates the negative number multiplication rule quite cleanly.

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
