Here's my prediction of how students at different ability levels would answer this question:

**Reasoning:**

This question tests the understanding of exponents, specifically with negative bases. The common error is forgetting that a negative number raised to an even power results in a positive number. Let's analyze each ability level:

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level likely struggle with negative numbers and exponents. They might focus on the '4' and the '-3' and perform some incorrect operation such as adding them or multiplying. The large negative number may be appealing to some.
*   **Basic:** These students may have a basic grasp of exponents but might make a sign error. Some might calculate 3<sup>4</sup>=81 correctly but forget the negative sign, incorrectly obtaining -81 due to overlooking the even exponent.
*   **Proficient:** These students understand the concept of exponents and the effect of negative numbers. Most of these students will get it correct, but there's still a small chance of a careless error.
*   **Advanced:** These students have a solid understanding and are unlikely to make a mistake.

**Predictions:**

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=2% C=5% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
