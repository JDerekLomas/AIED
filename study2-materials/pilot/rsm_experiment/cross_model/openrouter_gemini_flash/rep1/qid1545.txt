Here's an analysis of the question, followed by my predictions for student responses at different ability levels:

**Analysis of the Question**

The question tests the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). The crucial point is whether students remember to perform division *before* addition on the left-hand side. On the right-hand side, the parentheses clearly indicate that the addition should be done first.

*Left-hand side:* 8 + 12 ÷ 4 = 8 + 3 = 11
*Right-hand side:* (8 + 12) ÷ 4 = 20 ÷ 4 = 5

Therefore, 11 > 5, so the correct answer is A (>).

**Why this question might be tricky:**

*   **Order of Operations Errors:** Students might perform the addition on the left-hand side before the division (a very common mistake).
*   **Distraction of the '≥' option:** Some students might not be completely comfortable with inequality symbols and select >= just because it includes '='.

**Why most students will likely get it right:**

*   **Relatively Simple Numbers:** The numbers are small and easy to work with, reducing arithmetic errors.
*   **Clear Visual Structure:** The parentheses make the right-hand side's operations explicit.
