Here's my prediction of student responses, broken down by ability level:

**Reasoning:**

This question is about understanding the correct algebraic representation of division, particularly when dealing with brackets. The key is recognizing that dividing by (h+4) means the entire expression (h+4) is in the denominator. The question isn't overly complex in terms of calculation, so it mainly tests understanding of notation. The potential distractors target common errors: forgetting the brackets, or incorrectly placing terms.

*   **Below Basic:** Students at this level likely struggle with algebraic notation. They may misinterpret the division or brackets. They might choose randomly. B and D seem less likely because they contain things not in the original expression.
*   **Basic:** Students at this level have a rudimentary understanding of algebraic notation, but likely struggle with the order of operations within algebraic fractions. They might choose (C) because it contains all the information.
*   **Proficient:** These students are generally comfortable with algebraic notation and order of operations. They are most likely to get it correct, however some might rush and make an error. The C option might seem plausible to some.
*   **Advanced:** These students will almost certainly get it right.

below_basic: A=25% B=10% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=50% B=10% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=2% D=2%
