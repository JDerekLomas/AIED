This question tests a student's ability to translate division into fractional notation, specifically involving a bracketed sum. 

The main hurdle here is identifying the "denominator" as a whole unit. Students at the **below_basic** level often struggle with the positioning of terms; many see "h + 4" and are tempted by Option B (adding the 4 to both) or Option C (misunderstanding the reach of the division bar). **Basic** level students understand that the division sign becomes a vinculum (fraction bar), but often suffer from "positioning anxiety," frequently flipping the fraction to put the larger-looking expression on top (Option D).

**Proficient** and **Advanced** students usually find this straightforward, as the brackets explicitly dictate that $h+4$ must remain a single entity in the denominator. This is a "clean" question because the brackets prevent the ambiguity often found in expressions like $c \div h + 4$, which would trigger much higher error rates for Option C.

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=65% B=5% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=88% B=2% C=4% D=6%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
