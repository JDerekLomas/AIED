This question is significantly easier than many fraction addition problems because the denominators are the same and the sum of the fractional parts ($\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$) does not result in an improper fraction (no "bridging" or regrouping required).

The main "traps" here are:
1.  **Option D (The "Add Everything" Trap):** Students who mistakenly add the denominators together ($5+5=10$). This is the most common misconception at lower ability levels.
2.  **Option B (The Format Trap):** The question asks for a mixed number. $\frac{18}{5}$ is mathematically equivalent but is an improper fraction. High-ability students will spot this easily; mid-to-low ability students who convert to improper fractions to add them might stop there and forget to convert back.
3.  **Option C (The Multi-Error Trap):** Adding the numerators and denominators while ignoring the whole numbers, or other fundamental misunderstandings.

In a UK classroom context (Key Stage 3/GCSE), this is considered a "standard" or "easy" marks-gaining question.
