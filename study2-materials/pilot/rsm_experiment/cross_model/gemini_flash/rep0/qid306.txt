This question is a classic test of "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS), but it specifically targets a very common high-level misconception regarding the hierarchy of addition and subtraction.

In **Problem P**, many students incorrectly believe that because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, they must perform $5+6$ before the subtraction. However, addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be solved left-to-right. Therefore, the first step is $4-5$.

In **Problem Q**, the rule is more straightforward: Multiplication must be done before addition ($5 \times 6$).

**Analysis of the choices:**
- **A** captures students who read left-to-right but ignore BIDMAS hierarchy entirely.
- **B** is the **correct answer**.
- **C** is a "double error" choice.
- **D** is the most significant distractor for proficient students who know BIDMAS but misunderstand the "equal priority" rule for addition and subtraction.
