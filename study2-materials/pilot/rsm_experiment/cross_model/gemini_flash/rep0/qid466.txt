This question specifically tests the understanding of the **multiplicative inverse (reciprocal)** combined with **directed numbers (integer arithmetic)**. 

The primary trap here is the sign. Many students remember the rule "to get 1, flip the fraction," but they often forget that to get positive 1, the signs must match. Since the product is negative (-1), and the first factor is negative ($-\frac{3}{4}$), the star must be a **positive** number. This is a subtle reversal of the usual reciprocal rule ($a \times \frac{1}{a} = 1$). 

Lower-ability students will focus on the digits and either pick the same number (D) or its reciprocal with a negative sign (B) because they see a negative sign in the question and feel the answer "should" also be negative. Proficient students might overthink the "negative times a negative equals a positive" rule and incorrectly choose B to make it $+1$, forgetting the target is $-1$.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=40% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=65% B=25% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=6% C=1% D=1%
