This question tests a student's ability to rearrange a formula involving a fraction, a power, and the constant $\pi$. While the formula for the volume of a sphere ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) is usually provided or memorized, the algebraic manipulation required to isolate $r$ is a significant hurdle for many.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **The "Flip" Error (Option B):** Students often struggle with dividing by a fraction. They might multiply by 4 and divide by 3 (the wrong way around) or fail to move $\pi$ to the denominator correctly.
*   **The "Linear" Error (Option D):** Students with weak algebraic skills often treat the cube root as something that only applies to the $V$ or fail to understand the order of operations when reversing a formula.
*   **The "Numerator" Error (Option A):** This is for students who know the components but don't understand that to "move" $4\pi$ from the numerator of the right side, it must go to the denominator of the left.

**Performance Prediction:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often guess or pick options that "look" like the formula. They struggle with the cube root symbol.
*   **Basic:** Many will identify that a cube root is needed but will fumble the movement of the $4$, $3$, and $\pi$, often leading them to Option B.
*   **Proficient:** These students generally know the formula and the steps (multiply by 3, divide by $4\pi$), but a significant minority will make a transcription error or choose B by mistake.
*   **Advanced:** These students will rearrange the formula mentally or on paper with high accuracy.
