This question tests a very specific step in the expansion of brackets: the multiplication of two negative constants. While many students know the rule "a negative times a negative is a positive," the pressure of a multi-step problem often leads to cognitive overload where they revert to "adding" the numbers instead of multiplying them.

**Key factors for this specific question:**
1. **The Operation Error:** The most common mistake here isn't just a sign error; it is an operation error. Many lower-ability students see $-1$ and $-4$ and perform $-1 - 4 = -5$. This makes option D a very "sticky" distractor.
2. **The Sign Error:** Students who remember to multiply ($1 \times 4 = 4$) but forget the sign rule will choose -4 (Option B).
3. **The Addition Error:** Some students will add the digits but apply a "negative times negative is positive" rule to the sum, resulting in $+5$ (Option C).

In my experience, "Below Basic" students are heavily drawn to option D because they default to combining the terms rather than multiplying, as they often confuse the rules for expanding brackets with the rules for simplifying expressions.

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
