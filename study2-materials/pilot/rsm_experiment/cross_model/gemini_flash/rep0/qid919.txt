This question tests three distinct skills: substitution into a quadratic expression, understanding the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), and multiplying decimals.

The most common trap here is not the squaring of the negative (which often catches students out) but the interaction between the coefficient 3 and the decimal 0.3. Many students will mistakenly perform $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$, leading them to Option A. Others will correctly square first but struggle with the decimal placement ($0.3^2 = 0.9$ instead of $0.09$), leading to Option D. Option B ($0.27$) is the correct result of $3 \times 0.09$. Option C ($1.8$) is a "doubling instead of squaring" error combined with a decimal slip.

In my experience, even proficient students often stumble on $0.3^2$ or the order of operations when decimals are involved.
