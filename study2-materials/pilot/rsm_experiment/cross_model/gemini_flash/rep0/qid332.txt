This question targets a very specific and common misconception in multi-step equations: the order of operations when clearing a fraction.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
- **Tom's approach** follows the standard "BIDMAS in reverse" heuristic (adding 5 to both sides first). This is what most students are taught as the primary method. It is clearly correct.
- **Katie's approach** is the "trap." Students are often told they can multiply by the denominator to "get rid of it." However, Katie has failed to multiply the $-5$ by $3$. Many students at the basic and proficient levels hold the misconception that you only multiply the terms involving $x$ or the terms on the other side of the equals sign, forgetting to distribute the multiplication to every term in the equation.
- **Advanced students** will recognize that while you *can* multiply by 3 first, the result must be $x - 15 = 36$. They will correctly identify Katie as wrong.
- **Proficient students** often fall for Katie's logic because "multiplying by the bottom number" feels like a powerful shortcut, and $12 \times 3 = 36$ looks "right" to them.
- **Below basic students** often guess or simply pick "Both" because they assume in these types of questions that there are usually two ways to solve something.

The numbers in this question (3, 5, 12) are small and accessible, which means the errors won't be from arithmetic, but purely from the conceptual understanding of maintaining equality.
