This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem, which is a notorious stumbling block for many UK students. 

The most common error is to treat the relationship as $p = 10 \times 5$, leading to an answer of 50. Another frequent error is for students to assume the division must be "big number divided by small number" ($10 \div 5$), leading to the popular distractor $p=2$. Even students who know to divide often struggle with the direction of the operation, reaching for $5 \div 10$ ($0.5$). 

While advanced students solve this via cross-multiplication or by "swapping" $p$ and 10, many lower-ability students simply try to perform an operation on the two numbers they see, often choosing multiplication or the wrong order of division.
