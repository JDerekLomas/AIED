As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on common Key Stage 3 and GCSE student behaviours.

This question tests three distinct skills: common denominators, adding mixed numbers, and reading the final instruction ("Leave your answer as a mixed number").

*   **Option D** is the classic "add the numerators, add the denominators" error ($2+2=4, 7+1=8, 10+4=14$). This is extremely common among **below_basic** and **basic** students.
*   **Option A** is the correct numerical value ($\frac{99}{20}$) but in the wrong format (improper fraction). **Proficient** students often calculate by converting to improper fractions first and may forget to convert back, or simply stop once they see their numerical answer matches an option.
*   **Option C** is a "blind multiplication" error ($10 \times 4 = 40$) where the student doesn't understand common denominators or cross-multiplies incorrectly.
*   **Option B** is the correct answer ($2 \frac{14}{20} + 2 \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$).

**Difficulty Analysis:** The numbers are "friendly" enough that many students will reach 99/20 or 4 19/20, but the requirement to convert back to a mixed number is the primary discriminator between Proficient and Advanced.

below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=25% D=45%
basic: A=20% B=35% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
