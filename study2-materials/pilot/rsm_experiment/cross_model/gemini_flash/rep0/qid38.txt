As a UK maths teacher, I’ve seen this specific algebraic fraction problem many times. The difficulty here lies in the interaction between the denominator and the coefficients. 

To solve it, students must find a common denominator (usually $2x$). This requires multiplying $\frac{4}{x}$ by $\frac{2}{2}$, leading to $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$ (Option A).

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** This is the most common error. Students correctly identify $2x$ as the denominator but forget to scale the numerator of the second fraction (adding $3+4$).
*   **B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** This comes from the "add the tops, add the bottoms" misconception ($3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$). While common in lower sets, the $x$ variables usually discourage this slightly more than pure numerical fractions.
*   **C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** A less common error where students find the numerator $11$ but then "simplify" the denominator incorrectly.

**Teacher's Insight:**
This question is a classic "separator." Because the common denominator is already partially there ($x$ is in both), students are much more likely to choose **D** than they would be if the denominators were totally different (like $x$ and $y$).
