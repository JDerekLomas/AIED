To solve this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the linear equation $10x - 6y = 30$ and solve for $x$.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
This question is surprisingly tricky for mid-to-low ability students because the equation is not in the form $y = mx + c$. 
1. **The $y=0.5$ substitution:** Many students find it easier to substitute for $x$ than for $y$. Substituting $y$ requires them to handle a subtraction term ($10x - 3 = 30$).
2. **The "Minus-Sign" Trap:** The most common error is forgetting that the equation is $10x - 6y$. A student might incorrectly calculate $10x = 30 - 3$ (instead of $30 + 3$), leading to $27 / 10 = 2.7$ (Option D).
3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Basic level students often struggle with the two-step process. Some might multiply the entire equation by $0.5$ or simply guess. Option C ($3.3$) is the correct answer ($33/10$).
4. **Distractors:** Option A ($4.25$) is a common error result of incorrect transposition (e.g., $10x = 30 + 6 \times 0.5$ but then divided by something else or miscalculating the decimal).
