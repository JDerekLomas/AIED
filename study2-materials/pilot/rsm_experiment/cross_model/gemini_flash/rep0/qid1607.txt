In this equation, Isaac correctly handles the division in Step 1 (multiplying $15 \times 4$ to get 60), but fails at the additive inverse in Step 2. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to solve $60 = 1 + k$, he adds 1.

**Teacher Analysis:**
*   **Step 1** is generally well-handled across most levels because the "multiply by the denominator" rule is heavily drilled.
*   **Step 2** contains a very common "sign error" or "inverse operation" error. Many students see the $+1$ and instinctively add it to the other side to "combine" numbers, or they simply see $60$ and $1$ and move toward $61$ without thinking about the equality.
*   **Below Basic** students often struggle with multi-step logic; many will see the $61$ and assume because $60+1=61$, it "looks right," leading them to choose C.
*   **Basic** students often recognize Step 1 is correct but are prone to making the same mental slip as Isaac in Step 2, leading them to A.
*   **Proficient** students are usually wary of such questions and will test the answer. If they check $k=61$ in the original equation, they realize it doesn't work.
*   **Advanced** students will solve the equation correctly ($k=59$) almost instantly and identify the error in Step 2.

The trap here is that Step 1 is genuinely correct, which lures students into a false sense of security for Step 2.
