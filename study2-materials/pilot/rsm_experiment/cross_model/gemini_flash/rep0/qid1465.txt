This question tests Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and directed number arithmetic. 

The primary "trap" is the order of addition and subtraction. Many students incorrectly believe that because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, they must add before they subtract ($5+8$ rather than $3-5$ then $+8$). However, $4 \times 2 = 8$ is generally the first step most students identify correctly.

*   **Option A (6):** The correct answer ($3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = 6$).
*   **Option B (4):** This comes from a dual error: $4 \times 2 = 8$, followed by the common misconception that Addition happens before Subtraction: $3 - (5+8) = 3 - 13 = -10$, but then making a sign error or treating it as $13-3-6$. Less common than D.
*   **Option C (-12):** This results from working strictly left-to-right, ignoring the priority of multiplication ($3-5 = -2$; $-2+4 = 2$; $2 \times 2 = 4$... actually hard to reach -12 unless they do $3-5-4 \times 2$). 
*   **Option D (-10):** This is the most common "strong" distractor. Students do the multiplication first ($8$), but then perform addition before subtraction because of the acronym: $3 - (5+8) = 3 - 13 = -10$.
