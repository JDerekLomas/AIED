As a UK maths teacher, I find this question particularly interesting because it targets three distinct procedural "traps" rather than just a simple calculation error:
1.  **The "Zero Doesn't Count" Trap:** Students often ignore 0 when summing and, more critically, when determining the count ($n$) for the divisor.
2.  **The "Order of Operations" Trap:** In Option B, the lack of brackets means only the 7 is divided by 5 ($0+1+3+4+1.4$).
3.  **The "Hidden Correctness" of Option A:** Many students forget that adding 0 doesn't change the numerator, so $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ is mathematically identical to $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$.

**Below Basic:** These students often associate "mean" with "average" but have a weak grasp of 0. Many will choose C because they see four non-zero numbers and assume they should divide by 4. They are also highly likely to pick B if they use a standard scientific calculator incorrectly.
**Basic:** These students know to divide by the total count (5), but many will think Option A is "wrong" because the 0 is missing from the top, leading them to choose D (None of them) or B.
**Proficient:** These students recognise that the divisor must be 5. They are the most likely to be caught by the mathematical equivalence of A. They will look for a "perfect" formula, not find it, and likely opt for D.
**Advanced:** These students will recognise that $0 + \sum x = \sum x$. They will spot the BIDMAS error in B and the incorrect divisor in C, identifying A as the only mathematically sound expression.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=15% B=35% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=25% C=20% D=30%
proficient: A=45% B=10% C=5% D=40%
advanced: A=85% B=5% C=0% D=10%
