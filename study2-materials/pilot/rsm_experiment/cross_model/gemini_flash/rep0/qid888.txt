This question tests the expansion of a quadratic expression with two negative constants. While double bracket expansion is a standard GCSE skill, the signs in this specific problem trigger several classic misconceptions.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
1.  **The Sum of the Roots (Linear Term):** Students often struggle with $(-5) + (-7)$. Lower-ability students frequently calculate $(-5) + (-7)$ as $-2$ (calculating $7 - 5$ but keeping a sign) or confuse it with $+12$.
2.  **The Product of the Roots (Constant Term):** The "double negative" is a notorious trap. Students often correctly calculate $5 \times 7 = 35$, but frequently decide that "a minus and a minus make a minus" in the context of addition/multiplication confusion, leading them to pick $-35$.
3.  **Specific Traps:** Option B is correct. Option D is the most common distractor for students who can add directed numbers but fail the multiplication sign rule. Option A is the classic "finding the difference" instead of the sum for the middle term.
