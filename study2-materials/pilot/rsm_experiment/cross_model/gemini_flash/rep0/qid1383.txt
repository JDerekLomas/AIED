This question tests two distinct areas: the understanding of index notation (powers) and the rules for multiplying negative numbers.

While many students know that $3^4 = 81$, the negative base is a classic "trap." The most common error in UK classrooms for this specific topic is failing to realise that a negative number raised to an even power results in a positive answer. Many students perform the calculation as $-(3^4)$ rather than $(-3)^4$, or simply associate negative inputs with negative outputs. 

Options B and D target students who confuse indices with multiplication (i.e., $3 \times 4$). In the "below_basic" category, this is a very high-frequency error.

**below_basic:** A=15% B=35% C=15% D=35%
**basic:** A=40% B=10% C=40% D=10%
**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
**advanced:** A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
