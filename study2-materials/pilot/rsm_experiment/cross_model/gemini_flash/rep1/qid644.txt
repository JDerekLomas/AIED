As an experienced UK maths teacher, I’ve seen thousands of students tackle bracket expansion. This specific question focuses on a common "trap" in the FOIL method or grid method: the multiplication of two negative constants.

**Analysis of the Difficulty:**
*   **The Primary Distractor (+5 or -5):** Students at the lower ability levels often confuse the *operation* required. When they see -1 and -4, their brains jump to "collecting" or "combining" the numbers rather than multiplying them. $-1 - 4 = -5$ is a very common error for students who lack confidence in algebraic rules.
*   **The Sign Error (-4):** This catches students who know to multiply ($1 \times 4 = 4$) but ignore the negative signs or incorrectly assume "a negative and a negative makes a negative."
*   **The Goal (+4):** This is straightforward for those who know the rule "negative times a negative is a positive."

The specific choice of 1 and 4 is a strong distractor because the sum ($5$) and the product ($4$) are numerically close, which increases the likelihood of "Below Basic" students making an additive error.

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=65% B=15% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=88% B=7% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
