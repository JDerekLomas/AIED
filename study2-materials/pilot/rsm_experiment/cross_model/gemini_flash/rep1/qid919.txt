This question is a significant "trap" for students across the UK GCSE spectrum because it combines BIDMAS (order of operations) with decimal arithmetic—specifically the common misconception that $0.3^2 = 0.9$ or that $3 \times 0.3^2$ can be simplified to $(3 \times 0.3)^2$.

**Analysis of Errors:**
- **A (0.81):** The most common "conceptual" error. Students incorrectly calculate $(3 \times 0.3)^2$, i.e., $0.9^2$. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of BIDMAS/Indices.
- **B (0.27):** The correct answer ($3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$).
- **C (1.8):** A common "visual" error. Students do $3 \times 2 \times 0.3$, effectively treating the power of 2 as a multiplier.
- **D (2.7):** A decimal placement error. Students correctly do $3 \times 3^2 = 27$ but assume $0.3^2 = 0.9$, leading to $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$.

**Student Performance Prediction:**
- **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with BIDMAS and squaring decimals. Many will see $3 \times 0.3$ and square that result, or simply multiply all visible numbers.
- **Basic:** Many students at this level believe $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$. They will calculate $3 \times 0.9$ and arrive at $2.7$ (Option D).
- **Proficient:** These students generally know BIDMAS but are still highly susceptible to the "0.9" error. About half will choose B, while the other half will fall for the decimal placement trap in D.
- **Advanced:** High-achieving GCSE students (Grade 7-9) will recognise the $0.09$ requirement and perform the calculation accurately.
