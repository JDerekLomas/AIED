This question targets a very specific and common misconception in multi-step equations: the order of operations when clearing a denominator. 

Tom's approach is the standard "balance" method (adding 5 to both sides first). Most students, even those at lower ability levels, recognize this as correct. 

Katie's approach is where the challenge lies. She has multiplied by 3 but failed to distribute that multiplication to the constant term (the -5). This is the classic "only multiply the first and last terms" error. At lower ability levels, many students will see Katie's $x$ and $36$ ($12 \times 3$) and assume it is a valid "shortcut," not realising the $-5$ must also be scaled. 

The distinction between proficient and advanced students here is whether they recognise that Katie's line is algebraically invalid. Proficient students often fall for the "Both" trap because it "looks" like a viable step if you aren't paying close attention to the -5. Advanced students will spot the inconsistency immediately.
