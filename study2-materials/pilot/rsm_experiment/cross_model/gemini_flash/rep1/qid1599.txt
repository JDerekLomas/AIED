This question tests a student's ability to translate linear division into algebraic fraction notation, specifically dealing with the grouping implied by brackets. 

The main difficulty lies in whether the student recognises that the denominator must be the entire expression $(h+4)$. 
- **Option D** is a very common error (reciprocal error) where students swap the dividend and divisor. 
- **Option C** represents a misunderstanding of BIDMAS/Order of Operations, where the student "unpacks" the bracket incorrectly or forgets that the division bar acts as a grouping symbol for the entire denominator.
- **Option B** is a distractor for students who have a weak grasp of variables and feel the "c" needs a "+4" to balance the expression.

In the UK curriculum, writing division as a fraction is taught early in Key Stage 3. This specific question is relatively straightforward because the bracket clearly dictates the grouping, making Option A highly accessible to those with basic algebraic fluency.
