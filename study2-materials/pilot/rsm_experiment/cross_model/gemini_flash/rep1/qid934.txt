As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common student behaviours when encountering linear equations and tables of values.

The question is relatively straightforward but contains a few specific hurdles. The main challenge is that the equation $4x + 2y = 10$ is in implicit form rather than the standard $y = mx + c$. Students must either substitute $x=0$ and solve a small one-step equation or rearrange the formula first.

**Common student errors predicted for this specific question:**
*   **The "Coefficients Sum" Error (A):** Below-basic students often see numbers in an equation and perform a simple operation. $10 \times 2$ or $4 + 2 + 4 + 10$ might lead them toward 20, or they may simply guess a "large" number.
*   **The "Gradient/Intercept Confusion" (B):** Some students mistake the coefficient of $y$ or the result of a partial calculation as the answer.
*   **The "Intercept" Success (C):** When $x=0$, many students correctly identify that $4(0)$ vanishes, leaving $2y = 10$. This is the "easy win" for this question, making it more accessible than if $x$ were $1$ or $2$.
*   **The "Divide 10 by 4" Error (D):** Students who confuse $x$ and $y$ or assume the star relates to the first coefficient might do $10 \div 4 = 2.5$.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=40% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=65% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=98% D=1%
