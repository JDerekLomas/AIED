This question tests two distinct areas: the understanding of index notation (powers) and the rules for multiplying negative numbers.

While $k^4$ is a simple power, the substitution of a negative number creates a significant "sign trap." Many students at the lower and middle tiers recall that $(-3) \times (-3) = 9$, but they lose track of the sign as the chain continues ($9 \times -3 = -27$, then $-27 \times -3 = 81$), or they simply apply the "rule" that a negative number raised to a power must stay negative. Option B and D (multiplying $3 \times 4$) are classic "Basic" errors where students treat the exponent as a multiplier.

**below_basic:** A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%
*At this level, many students treat $k^4$ as $k \times 4$. The choice between B and D is almost a coin flip, while C attracts those who know it's a power but believe negative inputs must yield negative outputs.*

**basic:** A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
*Students here usually know that $3^4 = 81$, but the negative sign is the primary obstacle. A very high percentage will select -81 because they don't apply the "even power = positive result" rule correctly, or they calculate $-(3^4)$ rather than $(-3)^4$.*

**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
*Proficient students generally handle the calculation well. The main source of error here is C, caused by a "surface-level" application of the negative sign or calculator syntax errors (typing $-3^4$ into a scientific calculator without brackets).*

**advanced:** A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
*Most advanced students will recognise that an even power eliminates the negative sign. The only errors here are typically due to extreme haste.*
