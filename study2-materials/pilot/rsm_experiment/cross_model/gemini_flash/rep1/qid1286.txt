This question assesses two main skills: recall of the formula for the volume of a sphere ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$) and the ability to rearrange that formula to make $r$ the subject.

The most common errors in this specific problem arise from incorrect algebraic manipulation, specifically when dealing with the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ and the placement of $\pi$. 

*   **Option A** is a common mistake where students multiply by the numerator and the denominator rather than dividing by the whole coefficient.
*   **Option B** reflects a student who correctly moves the $\pi$ but fails to invert the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ when moving it to the other side of the equation.
*   **Option C** is the correct answer.
*   **Option D** represents a significant algebraic misunderstanding, where a student applies the cube root only to $V$ and treats the constants as simple multipliers.

The "Advanced" students almost always get this right because it is a standard literal equation manipulation. "Below basic" students often struggle to recall the volume of a sphere formula if it isn't provided, though they often guess based on which expression "looks" like a formula.

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=45% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
