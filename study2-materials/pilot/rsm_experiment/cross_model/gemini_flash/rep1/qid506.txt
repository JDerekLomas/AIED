This question is a classic "fractional operation" trap. While it tests a simple one-step linear equation, it specifically targets students' confusion between multiplication and division when dealing with fractions.

**Teacher Analysis:**
1. **The Choice A Trap ($p = 1/4$):** This is the strongest distractor. Students see the 3 and the 12 and instinctively perform $12 \div 3 = 4$, then place it back into a fraction. Many students at basic and below-basic levels treat the denominator as a separate whole number rather than part of a single value.
2. **The Choice C Trap ($p = 4$):** This reflects a total breakdown of algebraic rules, where students multiply the 3 and the 1/12 and somehow arrive at 4, or more likely, just invert the relationship between 3 and 12 entirely.
3. **The Calculation Error ($p = 1/9$):** This represents a student who knows they need to divide or multiply but performs $3 \times 3$ or misinterprets the relationship between the 3 and the fraction.
4. **The Correct Path (B: $p = 1/36$):** This requires the student to understand that to solve $3p = \dots$, they must divide by 3 (or multiply by $1/3$). Many students struggle with the concept that dividing by 3 makes the denominator larger ($12 \times 3$).

Because this specific question involves "3" and "12", the numbers are "friendly," which actually encourages the Choice A error because 12 is a multiple of 3.
