This question addresses two distinct aspects of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Problem Q is a standard test of multiplication before addition. Problem P, however, is the "hidden trap": many students are taught the acronym linearly and believe that because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in BIDMAS, they must add before they subtract. In reality, Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be performed left-to-right.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **Problem P:** This is the high-error part. Even proficient students often fall for the "Addition before Subtraction" rule, leading them to choose $5+6$ as the first step (Options C and D).
*   **Problem Q:** Most "Basic" students know multiplication comes before addition, so they will gravitate toward options B or D.
*   **The Trap:** Option D is the "Hyper-Correction" trap. Students who have memorized BIDMAS rigidly but don't understand equal priority will choose D because it follows the literal string of letters in the acronym ($A$ then $S$ for P, $M$ then $A$ for Q).

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=0% D=15%
