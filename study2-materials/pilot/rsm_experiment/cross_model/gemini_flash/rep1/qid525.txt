As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on the typical performance of students at Key Stage 3 and GCSE level.

The main challenge in this specific question isn't just the fraction addition, but the requirement to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."

*   **Option D** is the classic misconception: adding the numerators and adding the denominators ($2+2=4$, $7+1=8$, $10+4=14$). Lower-ability students almost instinctively do this.
*   **Option A** is the correct numerical value but in the "wrong" format (improper fraction). Proficient students often default to converting to improper fractions to calculate and may forget to convert back, despite the instruction.
*   **Option C** represents a mistake in finding a common denominator (multiplying denominators but not numerators, or simply picking a "large" number).
*   **Option B** is the correct answer ($4 \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$).

The numbers 10 and 4 are well-chosen; many students will use 40 as a denominator rather than 20, which increases the chance of arithmetic errors.

basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
