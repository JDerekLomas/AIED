This question tests a student's ability to expand double brackets with two negative constants. This is a notorious "sign trap" question. While the basic algebra of $m^2$ and $12m$ is straightforward, the primary distractors (A, C, and D) target specific arithmetic errors regarding the addition and multiplication of negative numbers.

*   **Option B is correct.**
*   **Option A ($m^2 - 2m - 35$)** is chosen by students who "find the difference" between 7 and 5 for the middle term and multiply $-5 \times 7$ to get $-35$.
*   **Option C ($m^2 + 12m + 35$)** is for those who know the double negative becomes a positive for the 35, but mistakenly apply that "rule" to the addition of $-5$ and $-7$.
*   **Option D ($m^2 - 12m - 35$)** is the most common error overall; students correctly sum $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12m$ but fail the final step, thinking "a negative and a negative makes a negative" when multiplying $-5 \times -7$.

In the UK context, "Proficient" students (targeting Grade 5/6) usually master FOIL but still frequently slip up on the final constant's sign. "Advanced" students (Grade 7+) rarely make this error.

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=35% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=65% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=92% C=1% D=5%
