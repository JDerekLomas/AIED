This question tests two distinct concepts: the multiplicative inverse (reciprocals) and the rules for multiplying signed numbers. 

The primary "trap" here is the sign. Many students remember that to get "1", you flip the fraction, but they often confuse the rule for the multiplicative inverse (which keeps the sign) with the rule for the additive inverse (which changes the sign). Because the target is $-1$, and the starting value is negative, the star must be positive ($negative \times positive = negative$).

**Below Basic:** Students in this category often struggle with fractions and negatives simultaneously. Many will pick **B** because they associate "reciprocal" with "keeping the sign of the original number" but fail to check if the product results in $+1$ or $-1$. Others may pick **D** out of a confusion that "multiplying by itself" is involved.
**Basic:** These students usually know the reciprocal is needed ($\frac{4}{3}$), but there is a significant 50/50 split on the sign. They often think a negative result requires two negatives or simply default to the "flipper" without checking the product.
**Proficient:** These students will verify the calculation. They know $(-) \times (+) = (-)$ and will correctly identify **A** to ensure the result stays negative.
**Advanced:** This should be trivial for advanced students, though a very small percentage might make a "reading error" and aim for $+1$ by habit.

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=45% B=40% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=1% D=0%
