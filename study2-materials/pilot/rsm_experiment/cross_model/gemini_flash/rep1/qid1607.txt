In this equation, Isaac correctly navigates the first step (multiplying by 4) but fails at the second step. Instead of subtracting 1 to isolate $k$ ($60 - 1 = 59$), he adds 1 to 60 to get 61.

This is a classic "inverse operation" error. Students at lower ability levels often see the $+1$ and instinctively add it to the other side because they associate the number 1 with "plus" rather than performing the balancing operation. Step 1 is frequently performed correctly even by lower-ability students because "multiplying the denominator out" is a well-drilled procedure, whereas the choice of operation in the final step is where the conceptual breakdown occurs.
