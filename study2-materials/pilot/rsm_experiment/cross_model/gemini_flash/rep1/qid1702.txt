To answer this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the linear equation $10x - 6y = 30$. 

The common pitfalls here are:
1.  **Operational errors:** $6 \times 0.5 = 3$. If a student incorrectly adds $3$ to $30$ they get $33$, leading to $x = 3.3$ (Option C).
2.  **Rearrangement errors:** Some students subtract $3$ from $30$ instead of adding it (confusing the sign in the equation), resulting in $10x = 27$, leading to $x = 2.7$ (Option D).
3.  **Variable swapping:** Mistakenly putting $0.5$ in for $x$ and solving for $y$ leads to $5 - 6y = 30 \rightarrow -6y = 25 \rightarrow y \approx -4.16$, which often leads to a guess like B.

Option C is a very strong "attractive" distractor because the calculation $30 + 3 = 33$ then $33 \div 10 = 3.3$ feels "clean" to a student, even if they aren't confident with their signs. Option D is the correct answer: $10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$. 

*Correction on the logic:*
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$ (Correct answer is C).

Wait, calculating Option D: If a student does $10x + 3 = 30$, they get $10x = 27$, so $x = 2.7$. This is the "sign error" distractor.

Below basic students often struggle with the decimal $0.5$ or the negative sign, leading to random guessing or picking D. Proficient students usually handle the one-step substitution correctly but must be careful with the $6 \times 0.5$ step.
