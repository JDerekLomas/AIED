This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. Even though the numbers are small, it is surprisingly difficult for students below the 'proficient' level. 

The primary trap here is the "big number divided by small number" intuition. Students often instinctively see 10 and 5 and perform $10 \div 5$ to get 2 (Option C). They ignore the algebraic structure where $p$ is the divisor. Option B (50) is chosen by those who see the division and decide to multiply the two numbers regardless of their position. 

Option A (0.5) is the correct answer ($10p = 5$, so $p = 5/10$), but it feels counter-intuitive to students who believe division should result in a smaller number or who struggle with fractional results.
