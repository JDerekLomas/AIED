As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen this specific algebraic fraction problem many times. It is a "medium-difficulty" algebraic fraction question because while the denominators are related (one is a multiple of the other), students frequently struggle with the inconsistent treatment of the numerator versus the denominator.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **A (Correct):** Students correctly identify $2x$ as the common denominator and multiply the second fraction's numerator by 2 ($3/2x + 8/2x = 11/2x$).
*   **B (The "Add Everything" Error):** This is the classic "low ability" error where students add the numerators ($3+4=7$) and add the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). 
*   **C (The "Forgetting the Denominator" Error):** Students realize they need a common denominator of $2x$, and they double the 4 to get 8, then add it to 3 to get 11. However, they lose the $2$ in the denominator during the final step or mistakenly think $x$ is the common denominator.
*   **D (The "Half-Way" Error):** Students find a common denominator of $2x$ but forget to adjust the second numerator. They calculate $3/2x + 4/2x = 7/2x$.

**Student Performance Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will gravitate toward B because it follows the rules for multiplying fractions (top $\times$ top, bottom $\times$ bottom), which is a common point of confusion.
*   **Basic:** They know they shouldn't just add the denominators, but they often forget to perform the same operation on the numerator that they did on the denominator, leading to D.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually get it right, though a small percentage will make a slip or choose C by losing the coefficient in the denominator.
*   **Advanced:** Almost all will get this right; the numbers are small enough that the mental common denominator is straightforward.
