As an experienced UK maths teacher, I’ve analyzed this specific question. It tests addition of mixed numbers with different denominators.

The most common trap here isn't a calculation error, but a **formatting error**. Many students will correctly calculate the value but provide an improper fraction (Option A) despite the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."

**Distractor Analysis:**
*   **Option B (Correct):** $4 \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$.
*   **Option A (Improper Fraction):** This is the numerically correct value ($\frac{99}{20}$). Stronger students who rush often pick this, failing to read the "mixed number" instruction.
*   **Option D (Adding across):** The classic $2+2=4$ and $(7+1)/(10+4) = 8/14$. This is a very common "Below Basic" error.
*   **Option C (Common Denominator error):** Multiplying denominators $(10 \times 4 = 40)$ but failing to adjust numerators correctly or mixing up the improper fraction conversion.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=20% B=55% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=25% B=70% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=10% B=89% C=1% D=0%
