As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen this specific problem type trip up students for two distinct reasons: the role of zero in data sets and the conventions of BIDMAS (order of operations).

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **Option A (Correct):** Students recognize that the sum of $0, 1, 3, 4, 7$ is the same as $1, 3, 4, 7$, but they must divide by 5 because there are five values in the data set.
*   **Option B (The Calculator Trap):** This is a very common error. If entered into a scientific calculator exactly as written without brackets, it would follow BIDMAS ($7 \div 5$ first). However, many low-ability students view this as a written "instruction" and see it as correct.
*   **Option C (The Zero-Is-Nothing Trap):** This targets students who think that because zero has no value, it shouldn't be counted in the divisor. This is the classic "mean of a data set with a zero" misconception.
*   **Option D:** Often chosen by high-ability students who are overthinking, potentially looking for a version that explicitly writes the $+ 0$ in the numerator, or those who correctly identify that B is mathematically incorrect due to BIDMAS and then mistakenly doubt A because the 0 is "missing."

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=5%
*Lower ability students struggle with the order of operations in Option B and almost half will instinctively exclude zero from the count, choosing C.*

basic: A=45% B=25% C=20% D=10%
*Students at this level are usually taught "zero counts" as a specific rule. Many will identify A as correct because the sum remains the same, though a significant chunk will still be tempted by the visual layout of B.*

proficient: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
*Proficient students know how to calculate the mean. The primary error here is usually rushing and not noticing that B lacks brackets, or over-identifying that 0 is "missing" from the sum in A and opting for D.*

advanced: A=85% B=2% C=3% D=10%
*Advanced students will immediately see A is mathematically identical to the "correct" formula. A small percentage will choose D because they are hyper-sensitive to the lack of brackets in B and might find A "incomplete" without the $+ 0$.*
