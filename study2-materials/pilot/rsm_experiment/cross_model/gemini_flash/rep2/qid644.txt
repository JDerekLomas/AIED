As a UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on the specific terms $(-1)$ and $(-4)$. 

The difficulty in this question lies in two distinct areas: the **operation** (multiplication vs. addition) and the **integer sign rule** (negative times a negative). Students in the "below basic" and "basic" tiers often confuse the rules for expanding brackets with "collecting like terms," leading them to add the numbers rather than multiply them. The most common trap here is $-1 - 4 = -5$ (Option D), followed by a basic addition mistake or sign error leading to $+5$ (Option C). Among students who know to multiply, the most common error is forgetting that two negatives make a positive, leading to $-4$ (Option B).

However, because this is a directed question about a single step, rather than a full expansion, many "proficient" students will correctly identify the multiplication.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=12% C=3% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=0% D=1%
