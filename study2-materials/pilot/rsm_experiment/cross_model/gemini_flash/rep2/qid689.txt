This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. While it looks simple, it is notoriously difficult for lower-ability students because the intuitive operation is to simply divide the numbers they see in the order that "feels" right (usually $10 \div 5$).

The specific numbers here ($10$ and $5$) are a significant trap. Many students will perform $10 \div 5 = 2$ and select **C**. Higher-ability students will recognize that since the answer is greater than the numerator, the denominator must be a decimal/fraction ($5 \div 0.5 = 10$). The distractors effectively target the common errors: **B** is for those who multiply ($10 \times 5$), and **C** is for those who divide the wrong way or assume the $p$ is the numerator.
