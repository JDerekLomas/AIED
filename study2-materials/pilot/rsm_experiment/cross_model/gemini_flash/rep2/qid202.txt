This question tests the addition of mixed numbers with common denominators. It is considered a "straightforward" version of this topic because there is no regrouping required (the sum of the fractions is less than one) and the denominators are already the same.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A (Correct):** Adding whole numbers (2+1=3) and numerators (1+2=3) while keeping the denominator (5).
*   **B (Misinterpretation of Format):** This is the correct value but expressed as an improper fraction. Since the question explicitly asks for a "mixed number," students who don't read the instruction carefully will select this, though most will naturally stay in mixed form.
*   **C (Computational Failure):** Adding both numerators and denominators ($1+2=3$ and $5+5=10$) while ignoring the whole numbers or mishandling them entirely.
*   **D (The Denominator Trap):** The most common misconception in fraction addition—adding the whole numbers correctly but adding the denominators together ($5+5=10$).

**Student Performance Expectations:**
The lack of regrouping makes this very accessible. "Below Basic" students frequently add the denominators, leading them to D. "Basic" students usually understand the algorithm for common denominators but may occasionally default to improper fractions (B). "Proficient" and "Advanced" students should find this trivial, with errors only occurring through extreme carelessness.

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=75% B=10% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=92% B=5% C=1% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
