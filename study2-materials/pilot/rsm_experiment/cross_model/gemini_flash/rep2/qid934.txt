As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've analyzed this specific question. The equation is presented in an implicit form ($ax + by = c$) rather than the explicit form ($y = mx + c$) students are more accustomed to when filling out tables.

The "trap" here is how students handle the $4x$ term when $x=0$. While $4(0)=0$ is mathematically straightforward, many **below_basic** students see the numbers $4$ and $10$ and perform a single operation ($10-4=6$ or $10 \div 4 = 2.5$) or try to solve for $y$ by ignoring the $2$.

**A (20)** is a common "operation scramble" error ($4 \times 5$ or $10 \times 2$). 
**B (3)** is the answer if they incorrectly substitute $x=1$ instead of $x=0$.
**C (5)** is the correct answer ($2y = 10$).
**D (2.5)** is a very common error where students assume $y = 10/4$ or confuse the coefficients.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=45% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=65% D=20%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=85% D=8%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=98% D=1%
