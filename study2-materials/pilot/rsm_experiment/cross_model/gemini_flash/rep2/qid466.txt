This question tests two distinct concepts: the property of **multiplicative inverses (reciprocals)** and the **rules for multiplying negative numbers**.

The core difficulty here is not the fraction work itself, but the sign. Students at the basic and proficient levels often remember that "to get 1, you flip the fraction," but they frequently over-generalise the rule "a negative times a negative is a positive." Because the target answer is $-1$ (negative), many students will instinctively choose a positive multiplier (Option A), incorrectly applying the sign rule or simply focusing on the numerical inversion.

**Below Basic:** These students often pick the original fraction (D) or its positive version (C) because they don't understand the reciprocal property. They often view the equals sign as a signal to repeat the number shown.
**Basic:** This group is the most likely to fall for the trap of Option A. they know to "flip it" to get 1, but they assume one negative in the question is enough to make the answer negative.
**Proficient:** These students generally know the reciprocal property. The main error here is a "slip" regarding the sign, often rushing and choosing A.
**Advanced:** These students will recognise that $(-) \times (+) = (-)$ and will correctly identify that the reciprocal must be positive to maintain the negative product.

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=94% C=1% D=0%
