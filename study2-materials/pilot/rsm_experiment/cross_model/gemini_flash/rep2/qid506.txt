As an experienced teacher, I observe that this question is deceptively difficult for students because it involves the division of a fraction by an integer, a procedure often poorly internalised.

The most common error is the "multiplication by 3 instead of division by 3" logic (leading to $1/4$) or simply confusing the relationship between the 3 and the 12. Students at lower ability levels often perform the operation $12 \div 3 = 4$, then either put it as a fraction (Option A) or as an integer (Option C). Advanced students will instantly recognize that dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying the denominator by 3, but mid-range students often "flip" the wrong part of the equation or incorrectly "cross-multiply."

Here is the predicted distribution:

**below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=35% D=10%**
(Students here often ignore the fractional nature and do $12 \div 3$. Option C is very attractive to those who struggle with fractions, while A is the "fraction version" of that guess.)

**basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%**
(Basic learners often think they should "cancel" the 3 into the 12, leading directly to $1/4$. This is the strongest distractor for this level.)

**proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%**
(At this level, students understand they need to divide by 3. Most correctly calculate $1/12 \div 3 = 1/36$, though some still make the reflexive error of simplifying $3/12$ to $1/4$ if they set the equation up incorrectly.)

**advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%**
(Advanced students recognize this as a one-step operation and are unlikely to be tripped up by the denominator placement.)

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
