This question tests the expansion of a quadratic expression where both constants are negative. This is a common stumbling block for UK students (typically GCSE foundation/higher) due to the triple demand of: 1) multiplying negative numbers, 2) adding negative numbers, and 3) managing algebraic terms.

**Key Traps:**
1. **The Double Negative (Constant Term):** Students frequently remember "a minus and a minus makes a plus" for the middle term but fail to apply it to $(-5) \times (-7)$, leading to $-35$ (Options A and D).
2. **The Sum (Middle Term):** Lower ability students often subtract the smaller digit from the larger or get confused by the signs, resulting in $-2$ (Option A).
3. **The Addition Confusion:** Students who think "two minuses make a plus" universally might apply it to the addition of $-5$ and $-7$, resulting in $+12m$ (Option C).

Advanced students will almost all get this right, while the "basic" cohort will struggle significantly with the sign of the constant term.
