This question tests a student's ability to translate formal division notation into algebraic fraction notation, specifically focusing on how brackets/groups are handled. 

While the concept is fundamental, many lower-ability students struggle with the visual structure of algebraic fractions. **Option D** is a very common "reversal" error for students who haven't mastered the concept of numerator and denominator roles. **Option C** is a classic mistake where students ignore the implied grouping of the brackets and only apply the division to the first term ($c \div h$). **Option B** is a distractor for students who believe "c" must also be modified by the "+4".

For high-ability students, this is extremely straightforward as the brackets clearly indicate the denominator. For lower-ability students, the visual leap from a horizontal string to a vertical fraction is where the errors occur.
