To solve this, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into $10x - 6y = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, and $x = 3.3$.

**Analysis of the difficulty and distractors:**
*   **The Trap (Option A/B):** Many lower-ability students struggle with the direction of the equation. Instead of substituting $y=0.5$ to find $x$, they try to use the numbers $10, 6,$ and $30$ with the $0.5$ incorrectly. However, the most common error is a sign error or "working backward" incorrectly. If a student thinks they need to subtract the constant and divide, but treats the $-6y$ as $6y$, they might do $(30 - 3)/10 = 2.7$ (Option D). 
*   **Option C (Correct):** $10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33$. This is relatively friendly because dividing by 10 is an easy final step.
*   **The Decimal:** Using $0.5$ is easier than a fraction, but it still introduces a layer of calculation where students might accidentally multiply $6 \times 0.5$ and get $3$ but then subtract it from $30$ instead of adding it (leading to $27/10 = 2.7$).
*   **Advanced vs Basic:** Proficient students will handle the two-step linear equation easily. Below-basic students often guess or perform operations on the numbers in the order they appear, or struggle with the negative sign.
