In this question, the student is asked to evaluate a two-step algebraic process. Step 1 involves multiplying by the denominator (correctly handled: $15 \times 4 = 60$). Step 2 involves isolating the variable $k$ by subtracting 1. Isaac makes a common procedural error in Step 2 by adding 1 instead of subtracting it ($60 + 1 = 61$), leading to an incorrect final answer.

**Teacher Analysis:**
*   **Step 1** is straightforward. Most students (even those with lower ability) recognise that the "4" needs to be moved and often correctly identify multiplication as the inverse of division.
*   **Step 2** is the "trap." Students often see $1+k$ and, in a rush or due to a lack of conceptual understanding of balance, simply perform the addition shown on the page rather than the inverse operation.
*   **Below Basic** students often assume the "working out" provided in a question is likely correct, or they fail to check the arithmetic of the inverse. Many will choose C because they see $60 + 1$ equals $61$ and assume the logic is sound.
*   **Basic/Proficient** students usually spot that Step 1 is correct, but the distraction of seeing "61" (which follows naturally from $60+1$) catches those who don't carefully write out $60 - 1 = 59$.
*   **Advanced** students will quickly verify $15 \times 4$ and then identify the sign error in the second step.
