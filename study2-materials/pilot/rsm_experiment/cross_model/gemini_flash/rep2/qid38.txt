To predict the performance on this question, we must consider the specific distractors and the common pitfalls associated with algebraic fractions.

**Analysis:**
The correct method involves finding a common denominator (making $\frac{4}{x}$ into $\frac{8}{2x}$), which leads to $\frac{11}{2x}$ (Option A).
*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$)**: Represents the most common lower-ability error—adding both the numerators ($3+4$) and the denominators ($2x+x$).
*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$)**: A very common error where students recognize $2x$ as the common denominator but forget to adjust the second numerator, simply adding $3+4$ over the new denominator.
*   **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$)**: A rarer error where students find the numerator correctly but somehow lose the factor of 2 in the denominator during simplification.

This specific question is tricky because the "obvious" path for struggling students (Option B) is available, and the "lazy" path for middle-ability students (Option D) is also available.
