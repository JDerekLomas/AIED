This question addresses two core concepts in the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS): the left-to-right convention for addition/subtraction and the priority of multiplication over addition.

In **Problem P**, many students suffer from the "A before S" misconception, believing that because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, they must add $5+6$ first. This leads them to options C or D. 
In **Problem Q**, the priority of multiplication is generally better known, but weaker students still tend to work strictly left-to-right ($4+5$ first).

**Why this specific question is tricky:** 
Option D is the "ultimate trap." It combines the common misconception in Problem P (adding before subtracting) with the correct rule in Problem Q. For proficient students who have memorised the acronym BIDMAS but don't yet understand that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority, D is the most "logical" incorrect choice.

**Student Performance Predictions:**

**below_basic:** These students generally work left-to-right regardless of operators. They are most likely to pick A because it follows the visual reading order for both problems.
**basic:** These students have started to learn BIDMAS. They will likely recognise that $5 \times 6$ comes first in Q, but will almost certainly follow the literal order of letters in the acronym for P, leading them heavily toward D.
**proficient:** These students are usually confident with $5 \times 6$ being first. However, many still fall into the trap of doing $5+6$ first in P. This group is split between the correct answer (B) and the common misconception (D).
**advanced:** These students understand that Addition and Subtraction are equal priority and are worked left-to-right. They will identify B quickly.

below_basic: A=65% B=10% C=10% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=5% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=55% C=0% D=40%
advanced: A=0% B=92% C=0% D=8%
