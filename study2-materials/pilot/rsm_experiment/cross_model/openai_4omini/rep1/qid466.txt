To analyze how students might perform on this question, we need to consider whether they will treat the negative multiplication correctly and whether they understand how to isolate the variable represented by the star (\(\star\)) in the equation. The equation to solve is \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \).

The correct approach to solve for \(\star\) involves following these steps:

1. Divide both sides by \(-\frac{3}{4}\) (or multiply by its reciprocal):
\[
\star = -1 \div \left( -\frac{3}{4} \right)
\]

This, by inverting the division to equivalent multiplication by reciprocal pressure leads to:
\[
\star = -1 \times -\frac{4}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

However, many emerging challenges arise considering misconceptions like treating negative signs, use of incorrect operation orders, or multiplicative inverses inadequately.

### Estimated Real Student Responses

**below_basic**
A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%

- These students may wrongly not manipulate variables in multiplication/division and may fall short on understanding negativity in operations.

**basic**
A=30% B=15% C=25% D=30%

- This widely varying impact might source from guiding misunderstanding as they might opt positively generated multiples of options based possibly frequent ill-positioning in steps needed.
