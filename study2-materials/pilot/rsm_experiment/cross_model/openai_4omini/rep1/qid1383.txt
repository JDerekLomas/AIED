**Rationale:**

- **Below-basic**: Many students struggle with negative bases and the idea of exponents. They may misindicatively view \( (-3)^4 \) and make a calculation mistake or confuse the outcome because negative times negative sometimes account ambiguously for not typical computing without clearer understanding.

- **Basic**: While a better understanding emerges, there's still an essential calculation misunderstanding hindering some students, thinking engaed semnnet that essentily misallocated negativity across their quadratics chosevalues peerۈنнымительных статье отпапять containedчен.
