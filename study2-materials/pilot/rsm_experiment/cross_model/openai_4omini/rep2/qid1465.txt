Analyzing the given expression \(3-5+4 \times 2\), we must keep the order of operations in mind, commonly remembered by PEMDAS/BODMAS. This means multiplying before doing addition and subtraction.  

The correct evaluation of the expression is:

1. \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Then proceeding with \(3 - 5 + 8\):
3. Perform subtraction first:  \(3 - 5 = -2\)
4. Now add \(8\):  \(-2 + 8 = 6\)

So the correct answer is \(A) 6\).

Considering typical issues that may arise among the various ability levels:

- **Below Basic:** These students might struggle overall with order of operations. They could forget to apply it correctly and could evenly split between common distractions based on gifts upward through numeric components perhaps favoring translocal limitations/exponential aspects in their comparisons mistakenly.
