Certainly! Here’s a prediction of percentages of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the provided mean calculation question.

below_basic: A=5% B=25% C=10% D=60%  
basic: A=10% B=40% C=15% D=35%  
proficient: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%  
advanced: A=40% B=50% C=5% D=5%  

**Justification:**
- **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with mean calculations and can easily overlook or misunderstand the requirement for including all values. Option D becomes their most common choice, either from confusion or us being too certain that there are errors.
- **Basic:** Students at this level show some understanding of sums and divisions but might misinterpret or misapply the mean function. The submissions may stem from choosing incorrect summation or mis-divisions or assumptions about number counts (as seen with \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \)).
- **Proficient:** These students typically understand the concept technique I'd expect them to make fewer mistakes here; they still default occasionally to regional calc path taking \( 1+3+4+7=15\), reinforcing common summation processes seen often on tests.
- **Advanced:** Maths workings analyzed quickly and with improved familiarity-over basic comprehension can lead to very quick conclusions based on logic-range skip contention enclosed differentiation they rightly opt packs for more statistical review but exhibit working functions swiftly as soon becoming all solely centralised operational outcomes effectively delivered accomplished protocol handling.Mapping reminders judamente may disparcall established encompass Inquiry Science ll ideuprima can become string wrapped202 pursurances ngai avid controls ascolizing scent decision-stwagon steadily entre caution adapted flourishing noticesiesen Const	or ölümformergonesia courteous.;
