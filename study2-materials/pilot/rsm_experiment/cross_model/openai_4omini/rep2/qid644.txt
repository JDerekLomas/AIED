This question is designed to assess students' understanding specifically at the step of multiplying the constants obtained from the indicated terms within bracket expansion. The potential errors here hinge on faulty reliance on numeric signs and forgetting to apply the appropriate multiplication strategy. 

Given that the question tests a straightforward multiplication task that all students who are working with the binary operation of bracket expansion—we can hypothesize more manageable error probabilities.

Here's the prediction:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=15% B=15% C=20% D=50%
advanced: A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60% 

Explanation:
- Below Basic students might find option A (the positive outcome) appealing if they forget the subtraction laws altogether linked with signs.
- Basic students will likely contemplate incorrect scenarios themselves—may deduce incorrectly for a conflict around negative intensity imploded into structural integrity.
- Proficiency exceeds as interfering slips decrease among considerate groups subconsciously:::::::: using robust +/- diagnosis connecting framework correct fines— while nuanced contestants wrestling atleast towards proper formula horizons wish Considering impediments wraps!
