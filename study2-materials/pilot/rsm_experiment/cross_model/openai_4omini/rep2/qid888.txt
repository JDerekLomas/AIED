This question involves multiplying out brackets, specifically knowing how to correctly apply the distributive property (FOIL method in this case). Watch for misconceptions around signs and coefficients when handling expressions involving multiplication like this.

- Most students must identify when and how to apply negatives, and unintended errors often arise under confusion about the representations.

- The correct expansion of \((m-5)(m-7)\) is \(m^{2} - 12m + 35\), corresponding to choice B. Let’s assess likely percentages for students at different ability levels.

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=25% B=50% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=7% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=3% D=1% 

This spread reflects likely errors based on ability, particularly as strong students are typically more comfortable navigating the details without misapplying negative signs or mistake-set additions.
