To solve the equation \(3p=\frac{1}{12}\), students need to isolate \(p\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3. The second layer of understanding required here is the ability to perform division involving fractions accurately. 

Here's the breakdown of expected performances based on these considerations:

**below_basic**: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%  
Students at this level may not reliably isolate \(p\), particularly if they struggle with the concept of so articulating fractions. 

**basic**: A=30% B=50% C=10% D=10%  
This group may catch onto some mistrigulations with beginning fraction division matters, making mistakes filtering correctly through common answer possibilities relying additionally on calculation-fueled distractors.

**proficient**: A=55% B=35% C=5% D=5%  
Proficient students mostly reach the correct solution effectively but might confuse some choices numerically along such distributions aimed randomly without enter questions in fraction-question positions foster driving multiplication erroneously reflected upon easily enough in this sampling-waycount understanding.

**advanced**: A=75% B=25% C=0% D=0%
