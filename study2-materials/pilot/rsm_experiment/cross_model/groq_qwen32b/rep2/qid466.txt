Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The equation given is -3/4 multiplied by a blank equals -1. We need to find what replaces the star.

First, the math here is solving the equation -3/4 × x = -1. To find x, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of -3/4, which is -4/3. So:

x = -1 ÷ (-3/4) = (-1) × (-4/3) = 4/3. Wait, but 4/3 is positive. Looking at the options, option A is 4/3. That seems correct. Let me check the signs again. If the left side is negative times something equal to -1. Let me do the equation again:

Original equation: -3/4 × x = -1.

To solve for x, divide both sides by -3/4. Dividing both sides by a negative number inverts the inequality if you're dealing with inequalities, but here, since it's equalities, the sign just flips. Let's compute it:

x = (-1) / (-3/4) = (-1) × (-4/3) = 4/3.

So x = 4/3. So option A is the correct answer. But why are there negative options?

The key here is handling sign changes correctly. Students might make mistakes with the double negatives. Let me see what mistakes might occur.

Suppose a student forgets the rule of multiplying two negatives. If they thought that since two negatives make a positive, maybe they just ignore the negatives here. Let's say they see -3/4 times something equals -1. If they cancel out the negatives, they might think that (3/4) × something = -1. Then x would be -4/3 (options B), which is incorrect. So if students misapply the rules, maybe they might pick B.

Another common mistake might be incorrectly applying reciprocal or reciprocal sign. For example, solving for x by flipping -3/4 to -4/3, but not adjusting the right-hand side. Wait, let me break it up again. Another approach: solve -3/4 × x = -1. Multiply both sides by -4/3 to isolate x? Wait, no. To isolate x, we divide both sides by -3/4, which is the same as multiplying by -4/3. Let's see:

-3/4 times -4/3 equals 1 (since they're reciprocals with opposing signs), so:

-1 × (-4/3) = 4/3 = x. Therefore x is 4/3.

So correct answer is A. The tricky parts are dealing with the signs and not confusing division with multiplication of fractions. Let's think about possible errors.

Some students might mistakenly multiply -1 by -3/4 instead of multiplying -1 by (-4/3). But that's actually correct because solving for x when dividing -1 by -3/4 is the same as -1 * (multiplying by reciprocal).

Alternatively, students might not invert the fractions properly. For example, if someone divides -1 by -3/4 but does not use the reciprocal. Let's compute -1 divided by -3/4. Let's write it as division: (-1)/( -3/4). Dividing by a fraction is multiplying by the reciprocal. So that becomes (-1) × (4/-3) = 4/3. But here, a student might not remember that dividing by a fraction involves flipping the divisor. So if a student just cancels the fractions directly, they might do something else. For example, they might see 3 in the denominator and 1 in numerator, and do 4/1 divided by 3, then say 4/3. So maybe that's correct.

But maybe some students confuse multiplication and division. For instance, they might think "well -3/4 times x equals -1, so x must be x = (-1) × (4/-3)" but if they miscalculate the multiplication part. Wait, but -1 × 4/-3 is the same as 4/3. Hmm.

Possible other mistakes: miscalculating the sign. If a student thinks that multiplying two negatives gives a positive result, so they want that x multiplied by -3/4 is -1. So x * negative = negative, meaning that x must be positive because negative times positive is negative. Therefore x should be positive. So if options A and B are 4/3 and -4/3, respectively. So correct answer is A. But if a student thinks the answer is positive 4/3, that's A.

But if they forget the sign rules or make another mistake, like multiplying when they should divide by reciprocal, then they might get wrong answers. Let's think about common fractions errors.
