Okay, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking what 3 - 5 + 4 × 2 equals, with multiple-choice options. I need to figure out what percentage of students at each ability level would choose each option.

First, let me solve it step by step correctly. According to the order of operations, multiplication comes before addition and subtraction done left to right. So 4 × 2 is 8. Then the expression becomes 3 -5 +8. Calculating from left to right: 3 -5 is -2, then -2 +8 is 6. So the correct answer is A)6.

Now, considering students' possible mistakes. The tricky part is that some might not follow the correct order of operations. They might perform the operations left to right without considering multiplication first. Let's see:

If someone does 3 -5 = -2, then adds 4 → 0, then adds 2 → 2. Wait, that's not even one of the options here. Maybe they do all operations in the given order incorrectly. Let's check another way. Maybe 3 -5 = -2; -2 +4 = 2; 2 ×2 =4. So the answer would be B)4. That's an option here. So those who ignore the multiplication priority would choose B.

Another common mistake could be applying the order as PEMDAS incorrectly, maybe adding subtraction doesn't group them properly. If a student subtracts 5 instead of treating 3-5 as separate. Or maybe miscalculating the signs. If they do 3-5= -2, then - (2×4)? Wait, no. Let me think again. If someone adds 5 and 4 by mistake instead of multiplying, maybe they make a sign error. For example, if they think the subtraction signs are positive? That could lead to miscalculations, perhaps leading to negative numbers. Wait, let's see:

Another approach is thinking order of operations differently. Suppose someone subtracts 5 first from 3, gives -2, then multiplies by 4? Wait, -2×2= -4 again, but the options are different. Let's not get confused here.

Wait, possible errors are mainly two: one is incorrect application of order leading to 4 (answer B), the other maybe combining all incorrectly.

Option C is -12. How could someone get that? If they misinterpret the multiplication, thinking 4×2=2 or similar. But not really. Alternatively, if someone subtracts 4×2, meaning subtract 8. So starting from 3, subtract 5= -2, then subtract (4x2)= -8 from it? That would give -10, which is option D. Wait, but if instead it's 3 minus [5+ (4*2)] =3- (5+8)= 3-13=-10. That could be a possible mistake if students mistakenly group addition and multiplication together incorrectly. So maybe C (-12)? Let me check: If they thought it's 5+4=9, multiplied by 3-4 or something? Wait, not sure. Maybe if someone does 3 -5= -2, then subtract (4×2)= -8 from that: 3 -5= -2; then -2 - (4×2)= -2 -8= -10 (option D). So perhaps D is due to that error. Option C would be -12. How? If someone does 3 minus 5 multiplied by4×2? Wait, 3 - (5 + 8) = -10 (D). But -12... Maybe if a student miscalculates 3 -5 +8 incorrectly. For example, if they compute 3 - (5 +8) = -10, which is D. Or if they do -(3 -5 +8)? Doesn't make sense. Maybe someone does (4×2)=8; 3-5+8. If they miscalculate 3 -5 +8 as 3 -4+(-1)? No, I think other mistakes would lead to options A or D here. Hmm.

Alternatively, someone might misread the numbers. For example thinking 3-5= -8, then adding 4×2 which is 8. But -8+8=0. But that's not an option. Alternatively, incorrect grouping: 3 -5*2=3-10= -7? 3-(5+4)*2? 13*2? Not matching. Maybe a student does 5+4=9, 2 as before? Confused about operations.

But given the answer options here, the most probable errors leading to the options would be:

A is correct. B is if you do all left to right ignoring
