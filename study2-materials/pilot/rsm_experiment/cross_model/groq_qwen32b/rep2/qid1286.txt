Okay, so the question is about finding the radius of a sphere given its volume. The options are different cube root expressions. Let me think through how students might approach this.

First, the formula for the volume of a sphere is crucial here: V = (4/3)πr³. The student needs to rearrange this to solve for r. Let me walk through that process step by step.

Starting with the formula:
V = (4/3)πr³

To solve for r³, multiply both sides by 3/(4π):
r³ = (3V)/(4π)

Then take the cube root of both sides:
r = cube root(3V/(4π))

Looking at the answer options, option C is cube root(3V/(4π)). That should be the correct answer. But wait, let's check the options again.

The options are:

A) ³√(4Vπ/3)

B) ³√(4V/(3π))

C) ³√(3V/(4π))

D) (3∛V)/(4π)

So, the correct rearrangement for option C matches exactly. However, let me make sure none of the other options could be a common mistake.

When rearranging, a common mistake might be incorrectly manipulating the constants during the multiplication inversion. For example, inverting the fraction might not be done correctly. So after multiplying by 3/(4π), the student could mistakenly multiply V by 3, but invert the constants differently. 

Option A is cube root(4Vπ/3). This might happen if a student forgets to move π to the numerator denominator correctly. Wait, if I start with V = (4/3)πr³, inverting to solve for r³ would require dividing by π and 4/3. But dividing by 4/3 is same as multiplying by 3/4. So, V = (4/3)πr³ → V ÷ π = (4/3) r³ → multiplying both sides by 3/4 gives (3V)/(4π) = r³. That seems right. So perhaps if a student makes a mistake when dividing or inverting terms incorrectly, they might get r³ = 4Vπ/3 (option A). For example, multiplying by π instead of dividing, which can happen if someone gets the inverse of an equation wrong.

Another mistake could be flipping the wrong part. For example, if they invert the (4/3) but forget to divide by π, so they end up with r³ = 3V/4. Taking that cube root would be (B)? Let's check:

Option B is cube root of 4V/(3π). How could that happen? Let's see:

From V = (4/3)πr³. Suppose a student divides both sides by 4π and multiplies by 3. Let me see where that logic goes wrong. For instance, solving for r³:

V = (4/3)πr³ → V ÷ (πr³) = 4/3. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if they incorrectly manipulate it by moving π to the denominator as part of the inversion step. Suppose someone thinks to invert fractions, but doesn't handle the constants correctly, maybe confusing the division and multiplication steps. Like if they have:

r³ = V ÷ [(4/3)π] = (V * 3) / (4π) which would actually lead to C. If they did that correctly. But how would they reach option B?

B is [4V]/[3π] so taking numerator and denominator... Hmm. Wait, option B has 4V divided by denominator 3π. That's like if you take the (4/3) from original equation, you reverse to 3/(4) but multiply the wrong variables. Maybe if the student divides both sides by π first instead of inverting the fraction. Let me simulate that approach.

Start:
V = (4/3)πr³ → divide both sides by π:
V/π = (4/3)r³ → then multiply by 3/4:
r³ = 3/4 * V/π → r³ = 3V/(4π). Wait, which is same as option C.

Hmm, so maybe option B is if they divided both sides by 4 instead, not knowing they should divide by pi first. For example, maybe they have confusion between multiplication and division. Let's see. Suppose the student thinks that they rearrange by moving all to the other side. Like, take 4/3 pi to the other side. To solve for r³, they divide by (4pi)/3? Wait, yes. Let me write again. Starting with:

V = (4/3)πr³ → Divide both sides by π →  V/π
