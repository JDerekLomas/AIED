Okay, let me think through this step by step. The question is about expanding two brackets with negative numbers, specifically when multiplying -1 and -4. The answer options are A) +4, B) -4, C) +5, D) -5. 

First, I need to consider how different ability levels might approach this. The key here is multiplying two terms in a binomial expansion and applying the sign rules correctly. Even though the overall expansion problem is straightforward, the actual multiplication step is testing knowledge of multiplying two negative numbers.

For the correct step, multiplying -1 from the first bracket and -4 from the second bracket should result in positive 4 (since a negative times a negative equals a positive). So the correct answer is A) +4. The trick part is when multiplying the terms from opposite brackets in the expansion. Let me break down what each ability level might think:

Below Basic students often struggle with sign rules. They might forget that multiplying two negatives makes a positive, leading them to incorrectly choose B) -4. Alternatively, they could confuse the multiplication of the constants, adding 1 and 4 instead, resulting in 5, but with a negative if they messed that up, hence maybe C or D. However, since multiplying negatives to positives isn’t intuitive to them, I imagine the majority picking an incorrect sign here.

Basic students might know the sign rules but apply more often through memorized steps rather than deep understanding, so when they multiply the constants, they'd get -1*-4=4. If they recognize the context correctly, they would not get tripped here. But maybe a minority might make a mistake with sign rules, maybe due to rushing.

Proficient students are likely familiar with this kind of problem. They might recognize immediately the multiplication is straightforward and choose A. However, if they misread and thought it was a cross term leading to a different part of the expression, maybe they might get confused with C or D? Let me see... In (2p-1)(3p-4), the four terms from multiplication are 2p*3p, 2p*(-4), -1*3p, -1*(-4). The arrow is on -1 and -4, which is the product -1*-4. So when that step is isolated, the correct multiplication. But perhaps when embedded, students might conflate with combining terms later, leading to adding the 3p and 4 or something. However, if the question is isolated, maybe that's not the issue here. If that step is only about multiplication, they'd do A correctly.

Advance students would know it's +4, and perhaps have a deep understanding of the rules. I wonder if they might have to recheck the calculation if any ambiguity exists. Since the question uses the arrows directly on the constants, it would seem clear. Any advanced ability could get this right without confusion.

So my estimates:

Below Basic: Maybe 30% choose B)-4 (incorrectly keeping the negative) because negative times negative equals negative (wrong memory), 40% A) +4 if they do it correctly by chance? Wait, below basic might be even more confused. Or perhaps even more would go A) by random guess. Alternatively, maybe most of them get it wrong. Maybe like 50% pick A or B, split, maybe 40A) and 10B) maybe? Wait no—I need to consider actual stats from teaching experience. Typically, when dealing with -1*-4, students who struggle would have 70% chance to miscalculate: 50% choosing correct A) +4? Not sure. If they don't know the rule, they might just do 1*4=4. But not knowing the negatives. However, if it was (-1)*(4), the answer is -4, and if it's (-1)*(+4) then B. Here it's (-1)*(-4), so maybe the question is testing if multiplying two negatives gives a positive. For those who know the rule, easy. For those who aren't confident, they might guess. If given the terms, below basic students might not remember that a negative times a negative is a positive. So their likely error is to pick C) -4 or maybe B) but wait, no, B is -4. Hmm, C is +5, maybe they added incorrectly, so perhaps that's less likely.

Looking at common misconceptions: a significant number incorrectly associate two negatives with subtract instead of considering their product. Wait—no, subtract comes into different contexts like 1-(-4) is addition. But here it's multiplication and division of negatives.

In primary years (lower ability students in UK), many might just multiply 1*4=4 and ignore the negatives or get confused with rules. If they know negative times negative is positive, that's correct. But if they don't internalize that rule, perhaps more would
