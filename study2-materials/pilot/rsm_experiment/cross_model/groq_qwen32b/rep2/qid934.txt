Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the problem is given a table of values for the equation 4x + 2y = 10, and the star is at the position where y is when x is 0. We need to figure out what that value is and choose the correct option among A to D. 

First, I need to remember how to work with equations in two variables like ax + by = c. Since the star is when x is 0, that simplifies things a bit. Plugging x = 0 into the equation should make solving for y straightforward. Let's try that step by step.

So, substituting x = 0 into 4x + 2y = 10 gives me 4(0) + 2y = 10, which simplifies to 0 + 2y = 10. Then dividing both sides by 2 should give y = 10/2 = 5. Wait, so the star should be replaced by 5, which is option C. That seems straightforward.

But why are the other options there? Let's think about common mistakes a student might make. For example, maybe they forget to divide both sides and incorrectly think that if 2y=10, then y=10, which would lead them to option A (20)? Wait, no, A is 20 here. Let me check the equation again. Wait, if x=0, then 2y=10, so y=5. If someone messed up the substitution, perhaps they did 4*0 + 2y=10 → maybe they subtract instead of multiply or subtract, but 4*0 is 0 regardless, so they could make an incorrect manipulation. 

Alternative errors: Perhaps misreading the equation as 4x + y =10 instead of +2y? Then, for x=0, y=10, which isn't an option here. But the options A is 20, B is 3, C is5, D is 2.5. Alternatively, if the student solves it correctly but makes a mistake in division, they could think 10 divided by 2 is 5, which is correct. 

But wait, let me check if there's another way someone could mess up. Suppose someone rearranged the equation to solve for y in terms of x first. So starting with 4x + 2y =10, solving for y would be 2y = 10 -4x, then y = (10 -4x)/2 → y =5 - 2x. Wait, is that right? Let me test it: 4x +2y=10 → divide both sides by 2 → 2x + y =5 → y =5 -2x. Then, substituting x=0, y=5 -0=5. So correct. So if x=0, y=5. That gives option C. 

What about option D:2.5? If someone divided the entire equation by something else, perhaps incorrectly dividing 10 by 4, but that would only make sense if x had some value. If they thought to set x to zero and maybe forgot to handle 4x and then y, no. Maybe they thought to use x as 5? Not sure. Alternatively, they could have substituted the numbers incorrectly. Let's see: maybe they confused the equation with 0x +0y = some other number, which is a stretch.

Option B:3. If they mistakenly calculated 10-2x/4= y when they should be subtracting differently. Let's see, the misdirection here is solving for y. For example, if someone thought y = (10 -4x)/2 instead of simplifying it correctly as 5 -2x. Wait, no. Wait, that is the correct way. Maybe someone thought that because the equation has coefficients that might complicate. But when x is 0, the equation simplifies correctly to y=5. So maybe other options are less likely.

Alternatively, some might think of intercepts. For a linear equation like this, the y-intercept occurs where x is zero, which is this problem's focus. The y-intercept is (0,5), since 4*0 +2y=10 gives y=5. So that reinforces that the correct answer is C.

Another possibility is someone misreading the star position. The star is under the y column, where x is 0. But the table might present x as first row, then y? Let me check: the problem states the table has x row: 0,1,2,3,4 and y has to fill in with gold star (maybe that's indicating the star is where the answer goes). So in the y row, there's only
