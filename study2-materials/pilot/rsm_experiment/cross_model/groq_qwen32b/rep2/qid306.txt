Okay, let's break down this problem. The question is about identifying which calculation should be done first in Problem P: $4 - 5 + 6$ and Problem Q: $4 + 5 \times 6$. The options given are A through D, each pairing a different choice for the first calculation in each problem.

First, for Problem P, the expression is $4 - 5 + 6$. Since there's only addition and subtraction, which are performed left to right according to the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). So the first step here is $4 - 5$, which gives -1, then adding 6. Looking at the options for which operations to do first, A and B correctly identify Problem P's first calculation as $4 - 5$. C and D suggest working from the right, which would be incorrect because addition and subtraction are left-associaed unless there are brackets. Students might incorrectly perform the rightmost operation first due to common misconception, similar to BODMAS not being emphasized properly.

Now Problem Q is $4 + 5 \times 6$. Here, there's multiplication and addition. Multiplication takes precedence over addition in the order of operations. So the first operation here is $5 \times 6$, then proceed with addition. So the correct part is $5 \times 6$, which options B and D correctly identify for Q. A and C incorrectly suggest doing the addition first.

Putting it together: the correct answer is Option B for this combination (Problem P's 4-5 and Problem Q's 5×6). 

Now, considering different ability levels:

1. **Below_basic students**: These might not understand BODMAS at all. In Problem Q, they might go left to right or ignore the multiplication priority. Common mistake in Problem Q is adding 4+5 before multiplying. For Problem P, perhaps they'll misread the left-to-right sequence. So maybe option A or C? However, in Problem Q, the multiplication is clear but if they do not know BODMAS, 4+5 first (A or C might lead to that). So for below_basic, perhaps they're caught by both errors: in option A: Problem P is right if first operation is 4-5, and Problem Q: 4+5 first. So maybe some might pick A. For others, in a panic, maybe they pick C: in P, 5+6 (which would give you 11 then minus1... wait no. But the order in Problem P should start 4-5. So perhaps Option B is correct, but below-basic students are less likely to get both right. Maybe some choose B (they pick first operation in each step correctly), others choose A, C, or D. Since multiplication vs addition in Q is straightforward if they know BODMAS, but if not... they might get confused. Let me think. The options B (4-5 in P and 5×6 in Q) would be correct for both. Other choices might include people mistakenly doing addition first in Q even though multiplies are higher priority.
For Problem Q, the common error is 4+5 (A, answer A and C) before 5×6 (B and D). For Problem P, the common mistake in lower levels is confusing order between left to right for subtraction and addition. So in below-basic, perhaps a significant number of them might pick C for Problem P (thinking to do 5+6 first, leading to 4 + 11?), and perhaps 4+5 first in Q (answer A or C) or maybe 5×6 first (if any got that right? Not likely.). Hmm.

But the correct first operation in Problem P is definitely 4 -5, right? For example:

Problem P: 4-5+6. Left to right.

- Step 1: Compute 4 -5 = -1

- Then add 6 gives 5. So Option B is the correct one.

If students do the subtraction first, then B or D for Problem P is correct. Wait in options B, Problem P is 4-5, and Problem Q is 5×6. So Option B is the only correct one.

Now for different ability levels:

**Below basic**: Many of these might pick the operations incorrectly for both Problem P and Problem Q. For Problem Q, not knowing multiplication comes first, they do addition: perhaps 4+5 =9, then ×6. So if they pick 4+5 first for Q (Option A: which suggests for Problem Q: doing 4+5 first), then in their answer, A) would correspond. However, option C suggests Problem Q's part:5\times6. So, in that case, C would require the correct first operation for Q, but the answer C for problem P's first operation is 5+6. Which is wrong
