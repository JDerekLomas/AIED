Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what percentage of students at each ability level would choose each option for the equation 10 = 5/p. The options are A) 0.5, B)50, C)2, D)No solutions.

First, solving the equation correctly: 10 = 5/p. Multiply both sides by p: 10p =5. Then divide both sides by 10: p =5/10 → 0.5. So the correct answer should be A) 0.5. But let's think about possible misconceptions students have.

Now, considering different ability levels...

Basic to advanced students might have different errors. Let's think of common mistakes.

For the basic students, maybe they try to divide instead of multiply incorrectly. Let's say a high ability student might invert the multiplication properly. But lower attainers could confuse multiplication and division directions.

Wait, 10=5/p → rearranging, p must be less than 5 to get a larger value of 10 when divided. For example, 10 is bigger than the numerator (if p was 1, 5/1=5, to get 10 you need p to be smaller, so 5 divided by 0.5 is 10. So answer A (p=0.5) is correct. So p=0.5.

But students might make mistakes here. Let's think of possible traps:

- Multiplying 5 by10 instead → p=50 (Option B) – that's a common mistake if they think "10 times 5" instead of "5 divided by 10". So 0.5 is correct, but perhaps some students invert the fraction.

Wait, another approach: the equation says that 5 divided by p gives 10. So if I have 5 divided by a number equals 10, meaning the number is 0.5. So perhaps higher ability students would get A. But lower attainers could do 5 multiplied by 10 (option B), perhaps thinking reciprocally incorrectly.

Alternatively, option C is 2. How could p=2 get here? Maybe if they add 5 and10... but that's unlikely. Or invert the equation: suppose you see 5/p =10, maybe student multiplies both numerator, like cross multiply? Well, cross multiplication would be 5 =10p → p=0.5. That's correct, so maybe option C (p=2) is a result of miscalculating: maybe if they divide 10 by 5 instead, like p=10/5=2. That's a possible misconception.

So for the more basic students, when faced with fractional equations, common mistakes include adding, subtracting, or reversing the operation. Let's break down the options:

A)0.5 – correct. But only those who multiply both sides correctly would get this.

B)50 – perhaps when they thought multiplying 5×10, which is wrong method but possible.

C)2 – maybe they thought dividing 10 ÷5, which gives 2 but is incorrect. Because 5 divided by two is 2.5, but in the problem, 5/p=10 would require p=0.5. Wait, maybe they think inverse of 10 × something gives 5. Wait, 5 divided by something is 10, that something is 5/10 =0.5. Alternatively, maybe they think of it as dividing 10 by 5 and get p=2.

For higher students, perhaps the C answer could be a mistake where they flip and cross multiply incorrectly. But I think the more common mistake is multiplying 5×10 (option B). However, another possible error is when solving reciprocal equations.

Let's see. If p was in the numerator, p/5 =10, then p=10×5, easy. But here, it's 5 in the numerator. So students who are new to algebraic equations might transpose wrong ways. For example, instead of doing 5/p =10, maybe they try dividing directly. But in that case, if you invert equations, the correct process is cross multiply. Let me see.

Let me structure students by ability levels.

For lower (basic/ below basic):

They may attempt by "plugging numbers in." If p is 2, 5/2=2.5, not 10. So incorrect. If they think that 5 divided by 2 is 0.5, that's not correct. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, option C is p=2. Then 5 divided by 2 is 2.5. Close to 2.5, but 2.5 is less than 10. Hmm
