Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what x is when y is 0.5 in the equation 10x - 6y = 30. The options are A to D.

First, maybe students will try to rearrange the equation to get x. Let me test that. So starting with 10x -6y =30. If y is 0.5, plug that in. So 10x -6*(0.5) =30. Calculating 6*0.5 is 3. Then the equation becomes 10x -3=30. Adding 3 to both sides, 10x=33. Then x=3.3. Oh, wait, that's 3.3, which is option C. Hmm, so if they do the algebra correctly, C is the right answer. But where could students go wrong? Maybe when dealing with the negative coefficient?

Another common mistake is when manipulating decimals. Maybe a student forgets to convert correctly when moving the terms. Wait, some might transpose -6y as positive 6y when moving to the other side. So let's see another possible path: Maybe someone moves -6y over as 6y and then subtracts it? For example, if a student sees 10x=30 +6y when rearranging? If that's the case, they do 10x=30 +6*(0.5). 6*0.5 is 3, so sum is 33, so x=3.3 again. Wait, that's the same result. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps someone might miscalculate 6*0.5? But 0.5 is half of 6, which is 3. That's straightforward. So unlikely unless the student is confused about decimals, but that seems too basic for even a low ability pupil.

Wait, another possible mistake: solving for y when they should solve for x? The table says x is blank and y is 0.5. So the equation is 10x -6*0.5=30. That's clear. Maybe sign errors here? Let me check another way. Suppose someone does the substitution correctly but miscalculates. For example, 3 +30= but in the equation it's 10x = 30 +3=33. 33 divided by 10 is 3.3. That's correct.

Alternatively, some students might miscalculate 3/10 as 0.3 or something similar when splitting terms? I don't see that leading to another correct option. So maybe other errors: suppose a student misreads the equation. If they think the equation is 10x - 30y= ...? Probably not. The table shows y values given as 0.5. Or maybe misplacing the coefficient. For example, maybe someone writes 6y as 3.6 because of 10x? No.

Looking at the options: A and B are 4.25 and -4.25; C is 3.3; D is 2.7. Where could those come from? If I made a mistake in the calculation. Suppose a student thinks of the equation as 10y -6x =30 instead, but that changes the equation. Let's try reversing. If they substitute y=0.5 into 10y -6x=30. Then 10*0.5=5; 5 -6x=30. Solving for -6x=25 → x = -25/6 ≈ -4.166… which is approximately -4.17 or -4.2. So the options near -4.2 are B. Then someone confusing x and y might pick B. So perhaps a student swapped variables in mind. If they substituted y correctly but swapped variables. Wait, but the question is solving for x given y. So swapping variables here might not make sense. Wait another angle: maybe solving for the wrong variable. If a person was solving for y given some x... but no. The context here is x is unknown and y is given. If instead someone tried solving for y=5 in the equation? Not sure. Maybe if a student made a sign mistake in the equation? 

Let me try this: if after plugging in y, the equation becomes 10x - (6*0.5) = 30. So 10x - 3 = 30. Adding 3 to both sides gives 10x=33, so x=3.3. So 3.3 is option C. If someone thought when moving -something to the other side it becomes minus, but maybe adding instead of subtracting?
