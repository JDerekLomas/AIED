Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the equation given is y = 3x², and they want to find y when x is 0.3. The options are A to D, and we're supposed to figure out what percentage of students at each ability level would choose each option. Hmm.

First, let me make sure I understand the equation correctly. For x = 0.3, substituting into y = 3x² would be 3*(0.3)^2. Let me calculate that. 0.3 squared is 0.09. Then multiply by 3 gives 0.27. So, the correct answer should be B, which is 0.27. Wait, option B is 0.27? The options are A) 0.81, B)0.27, C)1.8, D)2.7. Yes, so B is correct. Alright.

Now, I need to think about why students might get this wrong. Let's break down the steps students might take incorrectly.

1. **Miscalculating the exponent first step:**
   - Maybe students think squaring 0.3 is 0.9 instead of 0.09. That would lead to y = 3*0.9 = 2.7, which is option D. That's a common error when squaring decimals—sometimes people forget the decimal placement. For example, squaring 0.3: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09. But if you think of it as 3 squared is 9 and move the decimal two places, you get 0.09. If someone ignores the decimal place, maybe they do 0.3 * 0.3 as 0.9, which would lead to answer D. So some students might choose D due to missing that step.

2. **Adding instead of multiplying at the 3x² step:**
   - Maybe a student does 3 + 0.3² instead of 3*(0.3)^2. Let's see: 0.3² is 0.09. If you add 3 + 0.09, that's 3.09. Well, that's not any of the options. Hmm, maybe that's not a common error here. Alternatively, maybe someone could mistake x² as 2x? But x=0.3, so 2*0.3=0.6. Then y =3*0.6=1.8. But option C is 1.8. So that's possible. If a student thinks x² is x*x, but for some reason, a student might mistakenly interpret x² as 2x, maybe if they're confused between multiplying and squaring. That could lead to choosing C. So option C is incorrect due to this mistake.

3. **Multiplication error: 0.3² = 0.09, 3*0.09 gives 0.27 which is correct (B), but if they multiply 3*0.3 instead first: wait, if someone does that. Wait, another way a student might miscalculate is by first multiplying 3 and 0.3, which is 0.9, then square that 0.9 to get 0.81 (option A). That's A. So the order of operations mix-up here. If you do 3*0.3 = 1 (if rounded?), wait, no, more likely, maybe someone thinks they should multiply x by the coefficient first before squaring? So (3x)² rather than 3(x²) which is what the equation says. That would give 0.9 squared as 0.81 (A). Therefore, if order of operations isn't followed correctly, that leads to choosing A.

So, the possible incorrect choices:

- A: Misapplying order of operations: (3x)² = (0.9)² = 0.81
- C: Interpreting x² as 2x, leading to 1.8
- D: Miscalculating (0.3²) as 0.9 instead of 0.09 leading to 3*0.9=2.7

Therefore, the possible errors are linked to each option.

For each ability level, below basic, basic, proficient, advanced, what% would choose each option. Let's think about typical student proficiency.

**Below_basic:**
- These students probably make several basic errors. Many would confuse the order of operations by thinking (3x²) is (3x) squared leading to A (maybe some?), but more likely they miscalculate exponents. Since squaring is 0.09, but if they do
