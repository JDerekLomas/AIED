Okay, let's break this problem down. The equation given is 3p = 1/12.

First, solving for p, so I should divide both sides by 3, right? So p would be (1/12) ÷ 3. Let me calculate that. Dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by 1/3. So (1/12) * (1/3) is 1/36. That would mean p is 1/36, which is option B. If a student does this correctly, they should choose B. 

Now, thinking about common mistakes. Let's consider each wrong option:

Option A: p = 1/4. How could someone get this? If they mistakenly multiply instead of divide. If someone reverses the equation and does 12/3 they get 4, but maybe here they take 3 into 1/12 and subtract? Not sure, but this seems less likely.

Option C: 4. This looks like they did 3p = 1/12 by multiplying the 1 and 12 separately, so thinking 3 times 4 is 12 or something like that. But that seems off. Wait, if you have 3p=1/12, to solve for p you need to divide, not multiply. Maybe multiplying instead of dividing by the denominator?

But why would the answer be 4? Maybe if someone thought they needed to multiply both sides by 3 somehow? 3 times p equals 1/12, but if they don't get it right. Hmm, perhaps a student divides 3 into 1 instead of inverting... Wait 1 divided by 3 is 1/3, then divided by 4 gives me the wrong step?

Wait, no, the original equation is 3 times p equals 1 over 12. To get p, you have to invert the coefficient (3). Dividing 1/12 by 3 gives you 1/36. So if a student divides 1 divided by (12 divided by 3), which is dividing by (4), they would get 1/4 option A. Alternatively, if someone multiplies numerator by 3, maybe 3 times p equals 3 times p? That doesn't make sense. 

Wait, maybe option D is more interesting. Let's see. For option D: 1/9. How could they come up with that? Maybe adding 3 to denominator: 1 over (12 +3)=1/15 or 3*12=36? No. Alternatively, maybe they thought that solving 3p=1/12 requires multiplying instead of dividing. Like, since 3 divides p, they think inverse is multiply and do something like 9p=... wait maybe not. Hmm, seems less likely.

So for a student at basic or below levels, perhaps there's confusion over dividing fractions. Maybe they reverse the multiplication, but I think even simple students know to divide by 3 when they have 3 times something equals something. Maybe some mix-up here. For example, if someone says p is the number when tripled gives 1/12, the inverse operation is division, so 1 divided by (12 and 3?) Hmm, not sure.

Another possible error: maybe converting fractions to decimals. If they divide 1/12 as a decimal. 1/12 is approximately 0.0833..., so divide that by 3 gives roughly 0.0278, which is roughly 1/36. But converting decimals might not be helpful here and could lead to more errors. Alternatively, someone might do (1/3) of 12? No, that gives 4. That would be option C if divided wrong? Wait, no. Dividing 1/12 by 3 is (1)/(12*3)=1/36. Alternatively, thinking p is the denominator and solving for that. For example, setting 3*(something)=1/12 and then trying to find the something. Maybe multiplying the denominator by 3, so denominator is 1/12 multiplied by 3 to 1/4, getting (1/ (4))? 

Wait, another way: if you see 3p = 1/12, thinking how many times 3 does to go to 1? 9? No. Maybe that's not the case here. 

Another thing to consider: maybe some students use inverse operations correctly and get the right answer B. For higher tiers, I would expect mostly correct answers. At basic or below, maybe more students would choose the other options with higher probability. Let me consider each level now:

Advanced: These students should handle division of fractions well. Probably all choose B, perhaps
