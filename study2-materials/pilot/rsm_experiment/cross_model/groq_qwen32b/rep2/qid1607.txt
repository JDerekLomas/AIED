Okay, let's tackle this problem. The equation given is 15 = (1 + k)/4. Isaac's steps take the equation to 60 = 1 + k (step 1) and then to 61 = k (step 2). Students are supposed to verify which steps are correct.

First, understanding the correct method. To solve 15 = (1 + k)/4, you multiply both sides by 4: 15×4=1 + k → 60=1 + k. That's correct for step 1. Then subtracting 1 to solve for k: 60 -1 = k → 59 = k. But Isaac does 1 + k = 61 → k=61 here in step 2, which is wrong. Therefore, step 1 is correct, step 2 is incorrect.

So the correct answer is step 1 correct, step 2 incorrect. Looking at the options: answer A is "Only step 1", B is "Only step 2", C is both correct (wrong), D both incorrect (also wrong). So correct answer is option A.

Now, for predicting percentages by ability level. 

Below basic students might not know algebra steps well. If they multiply correctly in step 1 but see step 2 done in reverse, they might not spot the error and choose the wrong option. They might think step 2 is correct because it’s solving 60=1 + k properly. But if they multiply correctly, they'd see step 1 is right. So maybe some pick A. But maybe some get confused between steps and pick C or D. However, since step 1 is obvious (correct), if a student can spot that but not step 2, they might put A. Let's say A is 20%, B maybe they mistake step 2 as correct, others confused.

Basic: More likely to pick correct answer A. Some may mistake step 2's subtraction and pick D or B. Let's say A about 60%, C maybe if they think all steps are correct (if they didn’t read step 2 carefully).  Let’s put A=60%, B=10%, D=10%, C=20%.

Proficient: Stronger grasp, so many pick A. Maybe some slip up. Let's say A=80%, C is maybe if they don’t realize that step 2 made the error. Others pick A. Let's do 80% A, 10% C (assuming they think step 2 correctly solved the previous line: 60-1 would be 59). Wait, but Isaac’s step 2 is 60=1 +k leading to 61=k. So he added instead of subtracted. If some see that, then the answer is A. But if someone incorrectly sees step 2 as solving 60=1 +k correctly, they might think step 2 is right. So for proficient, less of that.  Proficient answerers can see step 2 is a mistake where 1 + k=60 leads to k=59, so step 2 is wrong. So maybe A=85%, and D if someone incorrectly says both steps are wrong.

Advanced students would clearly see step 2 is wrong. So likely over 90% get A. The answer is definitely A. So A would dominate. Maybe 95% A, C=4% (maybe if they misapply the steps), D 1% (unlikely if students are advanced.).
