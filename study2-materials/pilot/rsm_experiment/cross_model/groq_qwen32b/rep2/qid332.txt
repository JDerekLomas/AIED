Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The problem is about solving the equation x/3 - 5 = 12, and Tom and Katie suggest different next steps. We need to determine who's correct.

First, Solving equations like this usually involves reversing operations. So starting from x/3 -5 =12. To isolate x/3, you'd add 5 to both sides. Adding 5 to 12 gives 17, so the equation becomes x/3=17. That's what Tom says. Then Tom's step is correct.

Now Katie says x -5 =36. Let's check. If you look at her step, she multiplied the entire original equation by 3. But that's not the correct approach. The original equation is (x/3) -5 =12. If multiplying by 3 is done correctly, it should be applied term by term. Let's see: 3*(x/3) would be x, then 3*(-5) is -15 and 3*12 is 36. Then the equation would be x -15 =36. Wait, Katie's step says x-5=36. But if you multiply only part of the left side by 3, that's wrong. Maybe she multiplied correctly the left side but made a mistake? Let's see. Original equation: (x)/3 -5 =12. If Katie multiplied correctly, she would get x - 15 =36 (adding 5*3). But she got x-5=36, which is not right because 5 in the original equation is not multiplied by 3. So Katie's method has an error here. Alternatively, if someone multiplies the entire equation by 3 but misapplies the multiplication to only x/3 and not the -5. For example: they do 3*(x/3) becomes x, then they take (-5 *3)= -15 on the left side. So the equation becomes x -3*5 =3*12, which would be x -15 =36. But Katie's step is x-5=36, so she left the -5 as -5 instead of -15. Hence, that's incorrect. 

Wait, but another way: maybe some students would think that you need to multiply both sides by 3 first. Let's check that approach. When you multiply both sides by 3: (x/3 -5)*3 =12*2, so x -15 =36. So Katie's equation x -5=36 skips the multiplication of the -5. So her mistake is common because maybe they distribute the 3 incorrectly, maybe missing one term. 

Alternatively, Tom's approach uses the correct method of adding 5 to both sides. So according to the question, both steps are correct? No, the options are who is correct. So, based on this, Tom's next step is correct and Katie's is wrong?

Wait, the question says "a correct next line of working could be"— Tom says "correct next line" could be x/3=17. Is this the right step? Yes. Then for Katie's line x-5=36, maybe someone tried multiplying both sides by 3, but incorrectly applied it as only to x/3. Let me recheck: Original equation is x/3 -5 =12.

If you think that multiplying both sides by 3 would remove all fractions, but maybe the -5 is not properly multiplied. That's a possible misconception. So if a student multiplies incorrectly the entire left side by 3 but only applies it to x/3 and misses the -5. So instead of 3*(x/3) -3*5 = 3*12, which is x -15 =36, but if the student does x-5*3= ... which is x-15. So if they did that correctly, they're correct. But if they just do x -5 =36 (only multiply the x by 3, not the 5?), then that's wrong.

Katie's proposed next line is x -5 =36. That step suggests that they multiplied only part correctly. How would a student get there? Perhaps if they multiply both sides by 3: x/3 goes to x, and 12 goes to 36, but they keep the -5 as -5. So they forgot to multiply both sides correctly. Therefore, Katie's step is not correct. Thus, only Tom is correct, so the answer is A) Only Tom. So students who know to add 5 to both sides will pick Tom, while those who incorrectly attempt multiplication by 3 and make that mistake will pick Katie's. But if the actual correct next step is Tom's, than the
