Okay, let's tackle this problem. The equation given is x/3 - 5 = 12. Tom says the next line could be x/3 = 17, which he probably got by adding 5 to both sides (because -5 +5 cancels out on the left, leading to 12+5=17). Katie suggests x - 5 = 36. How would you get that? Maybe if someone mistakenly distributed the 3 after isolating x/3? Wait, no. Let's see: To reverse dividing by 3, you'd multiply both sides by 3. So if the left side is x/3, times 3 would make it x, and 7*3 would be... wait, x/3=17 here. So 17*3=51. But Katie made the mistake of multiplying the other terms before multiplying all? Like, x/3 -5 = 12, if you try to multiply everything by 3 without dealing with the subtraction first, maybe? For example: If you take (x/3 -5 =12) and multiply both sides by 3, getting x -15 = 36. Wait, but Katie says x -5=36. So maybe if they tried multiplying the -5 by 3 in the equation x/3 -5=12 and got x - (3*5) = 12*3? Let me check:

Original equation is (x/3) -5 =12. If you multiply both sides by 3 properly, you should get (x/3 *3) -5 *3 =12*3. That would be x -15 =36. So that step becomes x = 51. So Katie says x-5=36. If someone messed up the step and thought that multiplying each term, thinking maybe only x/3 becomes x and the rest stays, you might erroneously subtract 5? Wait, I don't see that path. Maybe the alternative path is that some students would add 5 instead of 17. Let me think:

Tom is correct: from initial equation, adding 5 to both sides gives x/3=17. His statement is correct for the equation. So x/3 is 17, leading to x=51.

Katie's approach: She transforms the equation into x-5=36. How would that happen? Maybe a student multiplies through by 3 but also keeps the 3 in the denominator wrong. Wait, original equation can be written as x/3 equal to something. Suppose someone says, "Well, since the problem divides by 3, maybe I should multiply everything, but if I multiply everything by 3, maybe they just say x-15=36. So that would give x=51, which is correct. Alternatively, maybe if they thought that subtracting 5 after multiplying by 3 just stays as it is? Like if they do something like (x divided by 3 minus something) times by 3 becomes x equals something, where they only apply multiplication to the division part but not the subtraction, leading to an incorrect x - something = ... So that might result in something like x -5=36. But how would that math?

If you multiply x divided by 3, then subtract 5 equals 12. Multiply each part wrongly? Maybe someone does (x/3 *3) -5 = 12*3, which would be x -5 = 36 (which is Katie's equation). So here they incorrectly applied the inverse operation by multiplying by 3 only the term x/3 but not the others. So that's a mistake. So Katie's method is a common misconception because someone is only applying the multiplication step correctly to the term where it's needed but leaving the rest untouched. Therefore, Katie's equation x-5=36 is wrong because the correct way would be x-15=36. But the correct operation Tom did is adding 5, leading to x/3=17. So Tom is correct and Katie is incorrect. Therefore the answer is A) Only Tom. But why would anyone choose any other answers?

Let me think about the students' misunderstandings. At basic and below-basic levels, students might not recognize inverse operations correctly and could confuse operations when solving. Maybe some might think that Katie is correct if they made the mistake she did. However, in more advanced levels, students know better. Also, some might think that both could be correct, especially if they aren't fully analyzing both methods properly.

For example, someone at a proficient level might check both methods but then see where mistakes happen. Advanced students would see clearly that Tom's method is correct and that Katie made an error.

Considering how this question is presented: the key is in the inverse operation when there's
