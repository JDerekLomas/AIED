Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is to combine and simplify the fractions 3/(2x) + 4/x. Let's first figure out the correct approach and then think about possible student errors.

First, to add fractions, you need a common denominator. Here, the denominators are 2x and x. The least common denominator here would be 2x because 2x is a multiple of x (since x times 2 is 2x). So, we need to adjust the second fraction, 4/x, to have a denominator of 2x. To do that, you multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2. That gives us 4/x = 8/(2x). Now, adding 3/(2x) + 8/(2x) would give (3+8)/(2x) = 11/(2x). The correct answer is A).

Now, looking at possible mistake paths. Let's consider where students might go wrong:

Option E) which isn't in the choices, but let's think about possible wrong answers. For example, adding numerators without common denominators. If you just add 3 + 4 =7, maybe someone might pick that, like D) 7/(2x) or A) but that's already correct. Alternatively, if a student tries to convert both denominators to x, they might mistakenly add 4/x as 4/(x) + (something) but since the denominators have to match, perhaps someone converts 4/x as 1/(8x)? Wait, no. Another possible error is miscalculating the equivalent fractions. Suppose a student forgets to adjust the second term properly, so just takes LCM as 2x, and converts 4/x as multiplying numerator and denominator by 2, so numerator becomes 8. That's correct. Wait, that would actually lead to 3/(2x) + 8/(2x) =11/(2x), correct answer A.

But where might mistakes be made? For instance:

If a student adds denominators as 2x + x = 3x? That would lead to something like (3+4)/(3x) = 7/(3x) which is option B. So that might happen if the student incorrectly adds denominators when adding the fractions instead of taking LCM.

Alternatively, someone might think, add numerators and denominators straight up. Wait, adding 3x (incorrect denominator) perhaps: 3/(2x) +4/x becomes (3+4)/(2x +x) =7/(3x), which is option B). So students who add denominators directly would get this wrong answer.

So B is possible for students who don't follow proper common denominator steps.

Option D is 7/(2x). How does that happen? Maybe after adding numerators correctly, 3 + 4 gives 7? But wait, that would require 3/(2x) + 4/(2x). But why would the student add numerators as 7?

Ah, maybe they thought that if the denominators are made the same, adding 3/(2x) and (4 multiplied by 2 in numerator? Wait, if someone tried to add the coefficients directly. Wait, maybe another common error is adding incorrectly.

Wait, maybe students multiply instead of adding. No, the question is addition. Let me think again. Suppose students add 3/(2x) and 4/x by taking LCM 2x. So first step is correct. But maybe when combining, they think that since first denominator is 2x and second converted to 2x (as 8/2x) but perhaps miscalculating. Alternatively, if someone adds 3 +4 to get 7 and then just keeps one 2x, that would be option A. No, but 3/(2x) +8/(2x) would give 11/(2x). If they instead thought 3x plus 4x, but no, denominators aren't x here.

Another thought: If students mistakenly think that 4/x is the same as 2 times something. Wait, perhaps they subtract incorrectly? Let me see:

Wait, if a student takes LCM 2x, first term is fine as 3/(2x), the other fraction they have to multiply numerator by2 (correctly), but someone might think that adding fractions just adds numerators directly, getting 3 + (something) which in this case would be 4x? Wait, no. Maybe not. Alternatively, if someone converts 4/x to 8/2x and then instead of adding 3 +8 =11 gives 11, but maybe miscalculates as 4+3? No, 3+8 is 11.

Where does 7 come into play?
