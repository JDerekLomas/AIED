Okay, let's break this down. The question is about expanding the brackets (2p - 1)(3p - 4), and specifically multiplying the -1 and -4. So the correct calculation should be (-1) * (-4) which is +4. The answer is option A.

Now, considering the difficulty here. Students need to correctly multiply two negative numbers, which is a foundational algebra skill. Let's think about possible mistakes. Multiplying a negative and a negative gives a positive, so maybe some might pick B if they forget the sign. But since both are negative, the result is positive, so answer B is incorrect because +4 is correct. Wait, no. The arrows are pointing to -1 and -4. Multiplying those gives (-1) * (-4) = +4, so correct answer is A.

But wait, in expansions like these, maybe there's confusion. For example, expanding brackets might require each term from the first bracket multiplied by each term in the second bracket. Maybe the question is testing the recognition of the middle terms? Not in this specific question though; the user specifically is looking for when they multiply the two negative terms. But let's not mix up with other parts of the expansion question.

Let me consider misconceptions. Some common errors when multiplying two negative numbers: maybe a student thinks (-1) * (-4) = -1*(-4) = just -4, so they might pick B. Or maybe they multiply the numbers 1*4=4, so sign errors: if both signs are negative, the result is positive. Students might mix up sign multiplication rules.

But wait, the actual process of expanding brackets here is straightforward if you focus on the specific terms. Since Molly isn't doing the full expansion, but just a particular step—the question is simpler than expanding entire brackets. So the main focus is on the multiplication of two terms with negative signs.

So who is likely to get each ability tier right? Advanced students would know that multiplying two negatives gives a positive so A is correct. Proficient as well. Below basic might have significant struggles with the negative signs. Basic might know the rules but make occasional slips. Let's break it down per tier.

Below basic level: Likely to struggle with sign rules. Some might do +4, others mistakenly do -4. Maybe some pick other options from calculation errors unrelated. So perhaps 40% would get it right (A), 50% pick B (-4), but others? Not sure, but probably B would have significant portion.

Basic might be 60% correct, some mistakes.

Proficient and advanced would be much higher—maybe around 75%+.

Wait, the options C (+5) or D (-5) might come in if you misinterpreted. But since -1*-4 is 4, why would others pick C or D? Let's think if the question had different numbers or steps that made this possible.

No, in the original setup, the user just multiplies two constants. Unless the arrow was pointed elsewhere, but as given, it's two negatives. So the other options, C and D, might result from adding instead of multiplying. Like (-1) + (-4) would be -5, but in the problem, it's specifically multiplication. A student might have the error of adding by mistake, leading to D. So if someone misinterprets the operation as addition, they go to -5, but since the correct is +4, which is A. Alternatively, another error might be if they do 3*2 (the other two terms) or something else. For example, if you take p terms and get 2*3 etc., those aren't involved here but might be in another expansion part. However, since the question is straightforwardly multiply the two terms shown, C and D might have less than the others, maybe 5-10%, but it's tricky.

So let's adjust:

For below basic:
- A) +4: Let's say, maybe half get this right, maybe 25% if they know the sign, but others don't. So perhaps some get confused and mix with subtraction steps. But if they add instead, they might pick -5 instead of multiply to +4. But if they multiply incorrectly. Alternatively, B (−4) would be thinking (-1)*(-4) gives negative. Suppose below-basic has weak grasp: let's say 40% choose B, because multiplying two negatives seems to produce negative (due to not learning the rule correctly), maybe 20% choose D if they added instead, and others (30%) maybe 20% on A and others like C?

Actually this is complicated, but since the correct answer is clear (A), maybe let's make reasonable guesses.

Let me look for similar question. If it's straightforward multiplication of two negatives, even at lower abilities, the majority will do correctly only if it's a basic
