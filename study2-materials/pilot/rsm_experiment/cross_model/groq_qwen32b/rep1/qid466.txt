Okay, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking for the value of star in the equation: -3/4 multiplied by star equals -1. Let me think step by step.

First, I need to solve for star. So, starting with the equation: -3/4 × star = -1.

To isolate star, I should divide both sides of the equation by -3/4. That would look like star = (-1) ÷ (-3/4). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so it becomes (-1) × (-4/3) = 4/3. So the answer should be 4/3, which is positive. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

But wait, why are some options negative? Like B and D. Hmm. Let me double-check the original problem. The original equation is negative three-quarters times a number equals negative one. When you divide two negatives, you get a positive result, right? So if the product is -1 and the first term is -3/4, then multiplying -3/4 by a positive 4/3 gives (-x * y becomes -positive * 4/3? Wait no, wait. Wait, original equation: (-3/4) * star = -1. So to solve for star, we can rearrange as star = (-1) / (-3/4) = (1) / (3/4) = 4/3. Because negatives cancel out. So star is positive 4/3. So answer A is correct.

Now, common misconceptions. Students who struggle might make various mistakes. Forgetting to invert fractions is a common error when dividing. If a student divides instead of multiplies, they might do (-1) divided by (-3/4) as (-1) divided by (-3) over 4. But actually, the correct calculation when dividing by a fraction is multiply by its reciprocal. Another error could be miscalculating signs. Maybe a student gets confused with signs: if left side is negative times star, and the right side is negatif one, then star must be a positive fraction since negative times positive gives negative result. Wait, -3/4 * star = -1. Solving for star: star equals (-1)/(-3/4) = 1/(3/4) = 4/3. So the answer is positive 4/3, so option A.

Now, thinking about possible mistakes. Some students might think: to get from -1 to the other side, you divide by -3/4. If they don't invert the divisor correctly, they might write answer as (-1) * (-3/4) instead of (-1) multiplied by (-4/3). That would be -3/4 times -1 is positive 3/4? No, no. Wait, no, the mistake could come from trying to solve for star by maybe inverting the fraction but not the entire equation. Wait, maybe a student might multiply both sides by 4 instead of dividing by -3/4. For example, if they think of it as multiplying both sides by -4, which would give: star = (-1) × (-4) ÷ 3. So that would still get to 4/3 correctly. That might not lead them error here.

Alternatively, another student might miscalculate the sign during the operation and come up with negative value. But in this case, since both numbers are negative in the division step (-1 divided by -3/4), it's supposed to be positive. If a student ignores the negative sign, they might end up multiplying -1 by 4/3 directly and get -4/3, but why would they ignore the negative? Maybe they forgot that dividing negative over negative becomes positive. But even so, why would someone pick option A over B or D? Wait, the options are: A is positive, B is negative, C is positive 3/4, D is negative. So B is negative with 4/3. Let me see.

Another possible error is a student who correctly identifies that the signs will cancel out, so the answer should be positive, but who then doesn't invert the fraction correctly. For example, multiplying -1 by 3/4 instead of 4/3 (but not sure). Alternatively, if someone tries to solve mentally and uses fractions wrong. Like thinking, "since -3/4 times something is -1, that thing should be... Let's see, each -3/4 step gets me -0.75 each time, so to get to -1, maybe adding up parts." Hmm, but maybe not helpful. 

For students at various ability levels: 

Below basic might not be comfortable with negative numbers and reciprocals. They might just guess the positive reciprocal without signs correctly, maybe picking A. But if they make the sign mistake
