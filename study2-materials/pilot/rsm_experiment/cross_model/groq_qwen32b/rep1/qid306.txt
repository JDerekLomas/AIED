Okay, let's see. The question is asking which calculation should be done first in each problem, P and Q. Problem P is 4 - 5 + 6, and Problem Q is 4 + 5 × 6. The options are A through D. Hmm.

For Problem P: 4 - 5 + 6. I know that addition and subtraction are performed from left to right unless there are parentheses, right? So the first step here is to do the subtraction first (4 - 5), then add 6. That makes the answer -1 + 6 = 5. So for problem P, doing 4-5 makes sense. So that would suggest options B, A, or maybe another if they messed up.

Problem Q is 4 + 5 × 6. Here, the multiplication takes precedence over addition. So first you do 5×6, which is 30, then add 4. So for Q, the correct part is 5×6, which would be in option B and D.

Looking at the options now. Let's check each choice:

Option A: For P, says 4-5 (correct), and for Q says 4+5 (incorrect). So the Q part is wrong. So if someone picks A, they're making an order of operations mistake for Q by not prioritizing multiplication over addition. This might be common for some students not familiar with PEMDAS/BODMAS.

Option B: For P says 4-5 (correct) and Q says 5×6 (correct). Correct for both. This should be a straightforward choice? Hmm. But wait, maybe for Problem P, even if there's a misconception, the correct left-to-right operation makes 4-5 first. So maybe B is correct?

Option C: For P says 5+6 first, which would ignore order of operations, and for Q says 4+5 (missing multiplication). Both components wrong. Likely a distractor, perhaps for someone not understanding either left-to-right or order in multiplication.

Option D: For P says left-to-right again 4-5 first is already correct here? Wait, 4-5+6 is left to right, so first is 4-5 which isn't in options C or D. Wait, no. The options for D have P first step as 5+6, which is wrong. So D would be wrong for P. So D's P part is wrong. So for D, maybe someone tried to apply the left-to-right for multiplication, but in P it's just subtraction and addition. So the correct first step in P is definitely 4-5. Similarly for Q, 5×6 is the correct step.

So the correct answer should be option B. Now, which other answers are common distractors? For lower-level students, maybe some might confuse the order in Q, doing add before multiplication. So perhaps A and D?

But for the below_basic group: these might not know about order of operations at all. For problem P, they might just do 4-5 and proceed left to right because subtraction is before addition? No—left to right rule applies regardless here. Wait, addition and subtraction are equal in order. So correct is to compute left to right. For example, 4 -5 is the first computation. The question is just asking "what calculation should you do first," so in Problem P, the first calculation is between the first operations from left. So maybe most can answer correctly for that part. But the issue is in Q, where lower-level students might think to compute 4+5 as a misconception (A or D options), which they actually shouldn't. So the distractors would capture their errors.

Basic, proficient, and advanced groups would know the correct order. Let me think about each level:

**Below Basic**: Students here likely struggle with order of operations. Even for Problem Q, they might not prioritize multiplication over addition (4+5 first) and might choose A (Q: 4+5). Alternatively, maybe someone in D for both steps?

But for Problem P, correct first step is 4-5 and option B or A. Let me check:

Option A: For P: 4-5; Q: 4+5 (incorrect for Q)
Option B: For Q: 5×6 (correct)
So below-basic students might get confused on Q. So Option A might be a common error.

Similarly, someone might pick Option D where P first step is 5+6 (incorrect, unless they mistakenly thought to proceed left to right even when the operations in P would be left to right anyway. Wait, since in 4 -5 +6, both additions and subtraction are processed in order. The first step is 4-5 = -1, then add 6. So the first calculation is between 4 and -5. So Option B's answer (4
