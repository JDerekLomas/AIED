Okay, so I need to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option for multiplying out (m-5)(m-7). The possible errors might involve sign errors in the expansion. Let's start by recalling the correct method and potential pitfalls.

The correct expansion is m² -12m +35. For two binomials with both negative terms, using the FOIL method would give first (m*m = m²), outer (-7m), inner (-5m), and last (-5*-7=35). So the outer and inner combine to -5m-7m = -12m. So the answer is B or A? Wait, option B is m² -12m +35, which is correct. Wait, let me check. Multiplying (a - b)(a - c) where a is same variable. Then, the outer is -7m and inner is -5m, sum is -12m. The constant term is positive 35. So correct answer is B. But the options given: A is m² -2m -35 (wrong in signs and coefficients), B is correct m² -12m +35. C is m² +12m +35, maybe adding both instead of subtracting. D is m² -12m -35, which has -12m but incorrect constant sign.

Common mistakes: Let's see. Mistaken FOIL with incorrect sign combinations. If a student adds the two inner terms (maybe 5+7=12 but wrong signs). If they thought that (-5) and (+5) or something, maybe a misconception on sign multiplication. Also, if they forgot the middle term's sign entirely. For the constants, the product is +35, so if they multiplied them but took -5*-7 as -35 instead of +35, that would give -35 but then combine the middle term correctly? Let's see. Let's go step by step.

If all steps correct (FOIL), answer is B. So what errors could lead to other options:

Option A: m² -2m -35. How does this happen? Let's think. Maybe multiplying the numbers but adding signs incorrectly. If they did m*m=-m², then outer terms as +8m. Not sure. Wait the answer here is m²-2m -35. How? Let's see:

If a student did (m +5)(m +7), they might get m² +12m +35. If the question was (m-5)(m-7), and instead, someone did something like m² + (-5m -7m) = +12? Wait. No, that would be for (m+5)(m+7). But if someone thought multiplying two subtract terms leads to adding the two numbers but that's not how it is. Alternatively, someone might have used cross subtraction but incorrectly. For example, (m-5)(m-7) might lead someone to m² + (5+7) m -35? That would be m²+12m-35 which is not any option. Or maybe someone thought m² - (5m +7m) + (35), which would be -12m +35, so B is correct. So why is A there?

Wait, another possible mistake: If the student does m*(m -7 -5) or incorrect combination. No. Wait, expanding (m-5)(m-7) using distributive property. Let's do that step-by-step. First: m*m - m*5 - m*7 + (-5)*(-7). That is m² -5m -7m +35, so total of m² -12m +35. So that's option B. For someone getting A (which has -2m but how?) maybe that could be a sign error where they added instead of subtracting. Wait, m² - (5m +7m) is -12. If someone thought the middle term was only from the cross product incorrectly, but that can't happen. For example, if they did m*m - (-7) - (-5), that would be m² +7-5 = m²+2. Then that doesn't fit. Another way: if someone thought (m -5)(m +7), they would have m² +7m -5m -35 = m² +2m -35, which is same as option A? Wait, option A is m² -2m -35. Wait, so if instead of multiplying two subtracts, they did minus and plus with 7. So perhaps a student miscalculates the cross terms by sign.
