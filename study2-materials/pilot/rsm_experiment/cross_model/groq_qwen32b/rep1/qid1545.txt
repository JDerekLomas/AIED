Okay, let me try to figure out how students at different ability levels might perform on this question. The problem is comparing two expressions: 8 + 12 ÷ 4 and (8 + 12) ÷ 4. The task is to pick the correct comparator symbol between them.

First, let's break down the question. Understanding order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) is crucial here. The left side is 8 + (12 ÷ 4), since division comes before addition. On the right side, the parentheses mean addition happens first, so (8+12) ÷ 4, which is 20 ÷ 4.

Calculating each step:
Left side: 12 divided by 4 is 3, plus 8 gives 11.
Right side: 8 plus 12 is 20, divided by 4 gives 5.
So the left side is greater than the right side, meaning the correct answer is A) >.

Now, considering common misconceptions. Some students might not follow the order of operations correctly. If a student incorrectly adds 8 and 12 first even without parentheses, they would think the left is 20 ÷ 4 which is 5, and the right also 20 ÷ 4. So both would be 5 and answer C) =. Others might ignore the parentheses on the right side, treating both expressions as same except the parentheses, but actually the parentheses change the operations.

Another error could be that they miscalculate the division. For example, maybe they divide 8 by 4 first mistakenly in the left side, but that's less likely since it's 8+12. But possible. Also, students might not recognize that parentheses only affect the left in the left expression.

For different ability levels:

Below basic: Students who have difficulty with the order of operations. They might have many errors here. Let's say 50% choose C thinking both are 5, and others choose A or B. Wait, but why choose B (left is less) in this case? Maybe some might subtract. Let me think. Those who get confused between > and < might choose B if they misread. Maybe some choose D incorrectly (ge).

Basic level: Understand order of operations but with some inconsistencies. Maybe 50% correct (A), but some pick C because of misconception. Maybe like basic level: A=30%, B=, wait, not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the calculation shows left is 11 vs right 5. So the correct answer is A (greater). Students who make the mistake of ignoring order on the left and calculate 8+12 first, they left becomes 20/4=5, and right side also 20/4=5. So they see both as 5 and pick C. So those students would choose C). Let's estimate: how often does this happen.

In basic ability, maybe 40% pick C because they don't handle order correctly. The rest, maybe 40% pick A. The remainder split between other options.

More thinking needed. For example, advanced students probably all know the order of operations and get C wrong. Proficient might have some. Let me look up some data or past exam analysis. I know that from experience, when students forget how parentheses change precedence, about 30-40% might pick C here on exams if their ability is not proficient. At A-Level or advanced level, likely 90% get it right.

Let me go through each category:

Below Basic: Very likely to make the big mistake on order. Let's say 50% of them pick C and 30% pick B, some A and D split. But maybe 60-70% might think left is 5 and right is 5, hence C.

Wait, if a student evaluates left as 8+12=20 first (incorrectly without div by anything yet), because order of operations not known. Then left would be 12/4=3 added to 8 gives 11. Wait, that's correct. So the problem here is misunderstanding if they think in the left expression that 12 is divided by 4 plus 8? No, that's not. The order is division before addition. So left expression is 12/4=3, plus 8 is 11.

Wait, but students who do 8 + 12 first, they would do 20 ÷ 4 =5 (incorrect on left expr). Because they add before division. That's a common misconception. So in this case, left expr is treated as (8+12) ÷4. Then they would say that both expressions are same ÷4, hence same value. So C. But the actual correct left
