Okay, so I have this math question: 3p equals 1/12. The options are A to D. Let's think. My job is to predict how students at different ability levels might choose each answer.

First, the correct solution here is to divide both sides by 3. If you do that, p is 1/12 ÷ 3. When you divide a fraction by a whole number, it's the same as multiplying the denominator by that number. So 1/(12*3) which is 1/36. That means the correct answer is B.

Now, thinking about wrong answers. Option A is ¼. Where could that come from? Maybe a student multiplies instead of dividing. If you think 3 * p = 1/12, you might mistakenly multiply 1/12 by 3 instead of divide. That would give 1/4. But wait, actually that would make p larger, which seems off. Alternatively, if a student cancels out and just does 1 over 4 without considering the 3? Not sure. But some students definitely reverse operations.

Option C is 4. That seems way off. Maybe they invert 3 divided by 1/12? 3 ÷ 1/12 is 36, so C isn't even from that. If a student just inverts numbers like flipping 3 p, maybe. Alternatively, they might miscalculate in the multiplication step. Wait, no. Probably 3 multiplied by 12? 3*12 is 36. Then if they subtract from their earlier steps? Not sure. It could indicate a confusion in steps. Students might not even follow algebraic steps and think "how to make it ½ from 3 and 12? But here, maybe they add incorrectly. Hmm, but 4 seems like a big number. It's possible that some students pick C when confused.

Option D is 1/9. Let's see. How would that happen. If a student adds up the numbers incorrectly. Maybe 3 and 1/12, and does 3*3? If the question was multiplying fractions, but here it's division. Wait, could they have thought 1/12 divided by 1/something else? Not sure. Maybe 1/12 of the way to subtract denominators, like 5 minus 3 gives 2 in the denominator? For a fraction 1/x? But that's mixing with subtraction of numerators. So maybe some think p is a number like 9. But why? If you do 3 into 1/12... Maybe they multiply denominator by 3 and keep numerator? Which gives 1/(12*3) = 1/36, but 1/36 is actually answer B. So not D. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the process. Suppose a student tries to do cross multiplication. 3p = 1/12, so if they write 1/12 = p/(1/9), maybe that's confusing. No, not clear. Alternatively, they might multiply instead of divide but with different numbers. Hmm, D is still probably a rare option.

So, who would choose which. Let's break down by ability.

For below basic ability, many might struggle. They might reverse division and multiplication. Let's say some choose A) 1/4 because they thought p =3 / (1/12) = 36? Wait no, if they mistake operation direction... Suppose they think 3p = 1/12 means p is 1/12 divided by 3? Or the opposite? Wait: if they think you need to undo the coefficient 3 by multiplying instead of dividing, then they take 1/12 times 3 to get 1/4 for A. That seems possible. Or maybe others choose C, 4, because they add 3 and 12 (though that doesn't math here), maybe they think 12/3=4? Oh, wait! Maybe this is a common error. If the student is trying to "isolate p" but they're not applying inverse operations correctly. So instead of dividing both sides by 3, they might mistakenly divide both sides by the same variable or add the denominator to numerator. For example, if they think to split the fraction 1/12 as a separate action, maybe multiplying or adding denominator numbers? So maybe some students try to cancel denominators inappropriately. For instance, if the equation was 3p = 1/4, to find p they divide 1/4 by 3, which is 1/12. So this example here is similar but more abstract with 1/12 divided by 3, leading to smaller denominator 36.
