Okay, let me think through this question carefully. The problem is about solving the equation 15 = (1 + k)/4, and students have to check Isaac's steps. Isaac did step 1: 60 = 1 + k, step 2: 61 = k. The options are which steps are correct.

First, understanding how to reverse the equation steps. The original equation divides (1 + k) by 4 to get 15. To isolate k, you need to multiply both sides by 4 first. Isaac does step 1 by multiplying both sides by 4. 15*4 is 60. So that step is correct. Then step 2: subtracting 1 from both sides would isolate k, but Isaac added 1? Wait, wait. Wait, equation after step 1 is 60 = 1 + k. To solve for k, subtract 1, giving k = 59. But Isaac in step 2 wrote k = 61. That's incorrect. So step 2 is wrong. So the correct answers would be only step 1 is correct. So answer A is only step 1.

Students might get confused here. For those at lower ability, maybe they forget to subtract 1, so they could think both steps are correct (answer C). But why not? If they made the same mistake as Isaac, they might. So, a common misconception is thinking they add 1 when it's actually subtract 1. So maybe lower-ability students are more likely to pick C, thinking both steps are right. Others might pick A or another answer.

Alternatively, someone might not realize the need to multiply by 4. But in the given problem, step 1 is 15 = (1 +k)/4, so multiplying both sides by 4 is correctly done (15*4=60). So step 1 is correct. Step 2 is subtracting 1 from both sides of 60 = 1 + k to get k=59. So if a student is confused and thought that step 2 should add 1, they would wrongly choose B or another answer.

Another angle: some students might do the inverse correctly in step 1 but then make a sign error. For example, adding 59 +1=60, but maybe mixing up steps. But the student who is confused in step 2 would pick answer A) Only step 1 correct. Those who correctly solve the problem but make a mistake in the logic of step checking would have different selections.

Looking at the levels: For advanced and proficient students, they'd probably identify that step 1 is correct but step 2 is wrong. They'd likely pick answer A. For basic level, maybe a significant number might think step 1 is incorrect because they made a mistake there. However, step 1 is standard (multiplying by 4). Since 15*4=60 is straightforward, even basic level can do that. The mistake in step 2 is more subtle—adding instead of subtracting because the 1 is positive. Maybe more students at lower levels get trapped here. Those who have confusion between reversing addition and subtraction might choose answer C, thinking both steps are right but making an error in step 2.

below_basic: A=40% B=35% C=15% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=1% C=1% D=8%

### Explanation:
- **Step 1 (Multiplying both sides by 4):** Even basic students can calculate 15×4=60 correctly (straightforward multiplication). Most students would recognize step 1 is valid here.
- **Step 2 (Isolating k):** Errors arise here due to reversing operations. The misconception occurs by misapplying inverse operations (e.g., adding 1 instead of subtracting 1).
  - **Low-ability students** are more likely to mistakenly think both steps are correct (answer **C**) because errors in reverse operations (e.g., confusing "what to do with the constant term") are common in foundational algebra tasks. The equation’s context is straightforward, but misinterpreting "1 + k" vs "1 multiplied by k" traps lower-attaining learners.
  - **Higher-ability students** recognize the flaw in step 2 and isolate answer **A** (only step 1 correct), but some might pick **D (both incorrect)** due to confusion about step justification, although this is less common for proficient/advanced pupils.

The simplicity of step 1 and subtlety of step 2 error lead these percentages. Few students (especially
