Okay, so I need to predict how students across different ability levels would answer this question about Tom and Katie's steps in solving the equation x/3 -5=12. Let me think through this carefully.

First, the question asks whether both Tom's and Katie's approaches are correct. Let's break it down.

Tom says the next step is x/3 = 17. To get there, he adds 5 to both sides: -5 + 12 = 17 - 5 is 17. That works correctly. So he's reversing the subtraction correctly. That seems correct. Now Katie suggests x -5 =36. Hmm. If we multiply both sides by 3 as per the original equation's x over 3, would that be valid here? Wait, the equation is (x/3) -5 =12. To do the inverse of divide by 3 early on before dealing with the -5, she's multiplying right part of equation first. Let me see: if x/3 is subtracted by 5, then maybe Katie's approach is incorrect because if you have to reverse operations in the right order. Alternatively, she might be thinking to do both sides multiplied by 3. Let's check:

Original steps: x over 3 minus 5. To isolate x, the last step is adding 5 (which Tom does). So, the first step is adding 5. Then multiply both sides by 3. But Katie is suggesting instead to first multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator. Wait, but if she does x/3 -5 =12, and she wants to multiply all terms by 3, it would be x -15= 36. So Katie's step is x -5 =36, but her error is that she only multiplied three to the division part and not the constants. Wait. Because when you multiply both sides by 3, you have to multiply every term by 3. If Katie said after multiplying both sides by 3, you'd get x/3 *3 -5 *3 =12*3? Let me recast.

Original equation: (x/3) -5 =12

If Katie wants to multiply everything by 3, the equation would be:

3*(x/3) -3*(5) =3*(12) which simplifies to x -15=36. So x-15=36, not x -5=36. Therefore, Katie incorrectly calculated the result of multiplying -5 by 3 as -5 instead of -15, leading to her incorrect step of x -5=36. Therefore, her step is wrong. Wait, no, let me check again. The correct multiplication would distribute 3 across each term: 3*(x/3) gives x, 3*(-5) gives -15, 3*12 is 36. Therefore, the step should be x -15=36, not x -5=36. Therefore Katie's step is wrong.

Therefore, only Tom is correct. So the answer should be A: Only Tom.

Now, considering how students might perform this:

below_basic students... Hmm, they might not know the correct steps. Maybe some confuse the order of operations. If they make the mistake that Katie's way works, they might select C or B. But for the answer.

basic level students: They might know adding 5 to each side is correct but maybe confuse on Katie's step. Some might miss that Katie didn't account for multiplying the -5, so perhaps they'll see Tom as right.

proficient: Probably get it right, but maybe a few confuse the multiplication step, especially if they aren't careful in distributing the 3 correctly.

advanced: Almost perfect scores here.

So estimating percentages:

below_basic: They maybe choose option C (both correct) as a misconception. For example, if they think both steps are valid, they'd select C. Also some might think Katie is correct. Let me think: How many students at below-basic would think that? Since Katie's mistake is a common distributive step (missing multiplication of a term or constant), perhaps up to 30% might get this wrong. So for option C as B option? No, the options are A-D as per answer.

Wait, let me make a chart again:

Option A is Tom only, correct.

So below_basic students might choose C thinking that both are correct, but that's wrong. Let's think: Below basic may not understand both steps. Maybe 40% choose C by adding all. Others choose others. Maybe 35% choose A, since adding 5 to both sides is simple to remember, but multiplying by three is more step-wise.

But for basic students, the percentage would be higher on A. Proficient and advanced would get A as correct. Advanced students might have
