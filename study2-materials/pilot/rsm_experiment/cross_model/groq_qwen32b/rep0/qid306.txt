Okay, let me start by analyzing the problem step by step. The question is about the order of operations in two arithmetic expressions. Problem P is 4 - 5 + 6 and Problem Q is 4 + 5 × 6. We need to determine the correct order of calculations and match them with the answer choices provided.

First, BIDMAS/BODMAS rules come into play, where multiplication and division take priority over addition and subtraction. However, in Problem P, it's all addition and subtraction. The common misconception here is that some students might think that left-to-right is not always the correct approach unless told otherwise. So in 4 - 5 + 6, they should process 4 - 5 first (since they're left to right) which equals -1, then -1 +6 equals 5. Alternatively, some might incorrectly think that adding 5 +6 first is correct, but that would be violating left-to-right for operations of the same precedence. Students with a lower ability might fall into this trap.

Problem Q is 4 +5×6. Here, multiplication definitely comes first: 5×6=30, then add 4, resulting in 34. If students ignore the multiplication priority and instead just add 4+5 first, leading to 9×6=54, that's the common mistake here.

Now looking at the options:

A) P:4-5, Q:4+5. So this is correct for P but incorrect for Q. So for Q they are choosing to add first, which is wrong. Thus answer A is invalid.

B) P:4-5 and Q:5×6. That's correct in Q. Correct for P too. So answer B should be correct.

C) P:5+6 and Q:4+5. This is wrong for both.

D) P:5+6 and Q:5×6. Correct for Q, but wrong for P.

Therefore, correct answer is B. Now, how would students answer?

Below-basic students might be confused about order, especially in subtraction and multiplication. For Problem P, not respecting left-to-right could lead to adding first, same with misapplying multiplication. Let’s estimate maybe some pick D here because they see order of operations with multiplication being correct but not left-to-right in subtraction.

Basic students might get Q right as they know multiplication first, but in P still follow the left-to-right. So B is correct here.

Proficient would get both right: for P, left-to-right (start with 4-5), Q is 5×6 first. Hence select B.

Advanced students would also answer B without issues.

Potential traps: Even in problem P, maybe some students misremember the order and think that addition comes before subtraction unless parentheses. But B is correct for P (left-to-right, since they have the same precedence), and Q also uses correct multiplication first.

So predicting percentages accordingly, keeping some possible misconceptions. For the below_basic: perhaps some might choose C or D based on incorrect ordering. But likely most would get D as for the multiplication part correct but still make errors in subtraction order. So say a large chunk might pick B, but there might be a split. Wait, but let me think again. Problem Q: answer B says first step in Q is 5×6, which is right. In P, correct step is 4-5, so correct. So correct answer is B. Students who select A would be correct only in the P part, wrong in the Q. Let me think of percentage for each level now.

For below-basic maybe:

- Some may have trouble with left-to-right for subtract/add, leading them to choose D's P part (adding 5+6), but that's wrong. For Q part D is correct. But if they get confused on both, maybe pick option D overall (P:5+6 and Q:5x6). But how?

But the options are separate. For example, for P, what's the options. For the choices given:

P options in answers (first part of the choice A,B,C,D) are either 4-5, 5+6. Similarly Q part: options are 4+5 or 5x6.

So if students think that 4-5 first (P) is correct and 5x6 first (Q) correct is B. But for others:

Option C is wrong for both.

Option D is wrong for P, right for Q.

Option A is right for P, wrong for Q.

Now, considering below-basic students: For P, perhaps 50% choose correct (starting left:4-5). For Q, they know to multiply first? Or maybe less, because they don't fully grasp it.

Alternatively, perhaps students who are below-basic may not know multiplication priority. For example, for Q: if they answer 4+5=9,
