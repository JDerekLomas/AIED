Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The question is asking which symbol belongs in the box between 8 + 12 ÷ 4 and (8 + 12) ÷ 4. The options are greater than, less than, equal, or greater than or equal. 

First, I need to recall the order of operations, BIDMAS/BODMAS, which in the UK is Bracket, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction. So in the expression 8 + 12 ÷ 4, I should do the division before the addition. Let me calculate that. 12 divided by 4 is 3, then add 8 gives 3 + 8 = 11.

Now the other expression is (8 + 12) ÷ 4. Here, the first thing to do is the brackets. Adding 8 + 12 gives 20, then divided by 4 gives 5. So now comparing 11 and 5. The first result is 11 and the second is 5. So 11 is larger than 5, which means the symbol should be >, corresponding to option A.

Now, considering what mistakes students might make here. Let's think:

1. Misordering operations in the left expression: If a student adds 8 and 12 first instead of dividing first, they would get (8 + 12) = 20, then split the 12 ÷ 4 step? Wait, no, the correct order is division before addition. If they messed that up, maybe they'd divide the 20 by 4 instead, but that's part of the right expression. So if someone doesn't do brackets correctly in the left one, they might get the same as the right. But that’s probably a rare misconception.

More likely, some students might overlook the brackets on the right side, but in reality, the brackets just affect which number is being divided. Alternatively, a student might not fully apply the order of operations, especially if they do the operations left to right.

Another possible error: For the left-hand side, maybe they do division after the addition, but that's the left-to-right approach, which is a common misconception. For example, if they did left to right: 8 + 12 = 20, then ÷ 4 = 5. That would be incorrect, leading them to think left expression equals 5 and right expression equals 5, thus choosing C) =. However, this would be option C but incorrect in this case. But if that happens, they might think both sides equal 5, so they could pick C.

So if many students do the left hand incorrectly, then maybe some might think it's equal. For the right side, calculating (8+12) first is straightforward. But let's consider the skill level here.

At lower ability levels, they might struggle with order of operations, especially the idea that division happens before addition in the absence of brackets. The correct answer is A) > but those who incorrectly apply operations left to right, treating them as (8+12) ÷ 4 on the left and same on the other side, would get equal but that’s wrong. Alternatively, if someone does correct order on left, they get 11 and on the right 5, so A.

So for the low basic to below basic group, some may pick C if they incorrectly perform addition first. Others might even get confused which symbol comes next. Maybe some pick D) >= as they see that left is greater than right and might think both is possible but that's unlikely. For higher level students, they know the correct order.

I think for the below basic, maybe 20-30% get correct (A), the rest maybe 50% pick C (incorrect), then other options scattered. Basic might have 40% getting it right, with majority confused. Proficient and Advanced would almost all get A correctly. So, percentages for each group accordingly.

Breaking down:

- Below Basic: Confused order. 30-40% A (correct), 40% C due to mistake.
- Basic: Improved but still 50% might pick C vs 50% correct.
- Proficient: 80% correct. C only as distractor with 10% maybe.
- Advanced: All except a few might select A.

below_basic: A=35% B=10% C=45% D=10%  
basic: A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%  
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%  
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
