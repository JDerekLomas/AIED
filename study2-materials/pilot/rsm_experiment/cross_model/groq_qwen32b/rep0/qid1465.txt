Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is straightforward but may test some key areas where students might make mistakes. The expression is 3 - 5 + 4 × 2. The correct order of operations is BIDMAS/BODMAS (Brackets, Indices/Order, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction). So, first, we should do the multiplication part before addition and subtraction from left to right.

Let me break it down:
1. Calculate 4 × 2 first. That gives 8.
2. Now substitute back, so the equation becomes 3 - 5 + 8.
3. Then perform the additions and subtractions left to right: 
   - 3 - 5 is -2. 
   - Then -2 + 8 equals 6.

The correct answer is A) 6. However, some students might get tripped up. 

Possible errors:
- Misconception about order of operations: If a student forgets that multiplication should be done before addition and subtraction, they might do 3 - 5 first (which is -2), then add 4 (to get -2 + 4) and finally multiply by 2. That would be (-2 +4 )×2 = 2 × 2 = 4 (answer B).
- Alternatively, someone might incorrectly rearr ange the operations, perhaps thinking subtraction first in a different order or miscalculating negative numbers. However, in this problem, the main issue is adhering strictly to the correct order.

Let's assess how likely students are to make these errors based on their ability levels. Below basic students might struggle more with the order of operations, possibly going from left to right, leading to -2 + 8 (answer A) correctly, but maybe others like calculating 3 -4 first if misapplied operations. Wait, in reality, there's a fixed left-right order once the multiplication is done. The confusion might not be in the order of operations per se but perhaps in combining the steps.

Basic ability students could confuse 3 -5 as (-2) and 4 × 2=8, then add to get 6, correct. But some might have the misconception in the order of adding and subtracting after multiplication.

Proficient and advanced likely stick to correct order, unless confused by similar problems with parentheses. Advanced will handle this correctly, maybe 95%+ answer A=6%.

Wait, another point: If students miscalculate the multiplication step as addition first? Like, if someone does 4+2 as well. But that's not part of the given expression. Wait, the operation is times. So perhaps students do a correct order but miscalculations. For example, calculating 4×2=8 correctly. Then proceed. Maybe the error lies in adding/subtracting incorrectly: 3 -5 = -2, then +8 gives 6. The only alternative mistake might be if someone does -5 +4= -1, then -1+3=2 multiplied by 2? So (-1+3)*2=4, option B again. 

Alternatively, if someone does all operations left to right without multiplication priority, which is wrong, 3 -5 +4×2 becomes (3-5)= -2, then +4= 2, x2=4 (B). So some might choose B. Let's think about percentages for each level.

In a typical cohort:

Below_basic students might not know the order, so they'll likely do left-to-right: 3 -5 +4 ×2. Left to right without doing multiplication first: 
3 -5 = -2.
Then -2 +4 = 2. Then 2 x2 =4. Answer B is correct here (so percentage choosing B higher).

Basic students might do the multiplication correctly:4×2=8. Then proceed with 3-5+8=6 (A). But some may miscalculate in steps. For example, if someone does 3+4=7 then 7x2-5? Wait, that's incorrect order. So that would produce 14-5=9. Maybe not one of the options. However, in the given options, that's not an option. So maybe other misconceptions here might not apply.

But another possibility: If someone groups addition before multiplication. Like, think of 3 - [(-5+4)×2], but that's not correct according to order but might happen. The expression is 3 -5 + [4×2]. If a student sees it as (3-5+4)×2, that would be [(3-5)+4]×2 = (2)×2=4 (B). This grouping is a common error. How often does that happen?

Let's adjust the estimates. So for a lower ability student, making the wrong grouping, leading to B.
