Okay, let me try to work through this question step by step. So, the question is about a table with x values from 0 to 4 and corresponding y values. At x=0, there's a star that needs to be filled in. The equation given is 4x + 2y = 10. We need to find the correct y-value for x=0, which is the gold star in the table. The answer choices are A) 20, B) 3, C) 5, D) 2.5.

First, let me recall how to solve for y in a linear equation like this. The equation is linear, so rearranging it should give me y in terms of x, or at least allow me to solve for y when given x. The equation is 4x + 2y = 10. The goal is to plug in x=0 into this equation and find y, which will replace the star.

So solving for y: If I rearrange the equation, subtract 4x from both sides: 2y = 10 - 4x. Then divide by 2: y = (10 - 4x)/2. Simplify that to y = 5 - 2x. Alternatively, maybe some might prefer to leave it in the unsimplified form and plug in x=0. Let's check both ways.

Using the rearranged equation y = 5 - 2x, when x=0, y becomes 5 - 0 = 5. Wait, but 5 isn't one of the answer choices. The answer options don't have 5 here? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, answer options are C is 5? Wait, looking back at the question options: C) 5. Wait, that's a problem. I thought in the original answer options, C is 5. So substituting x=0 gives y = (10 - 0)/2 = 10/2 = 5. Oh, okay, so answer C is 5. So that would mean answer C is the correct choice.

But let me confirm again. Original equation: 4x + 2y = 10. If x is 0, then 0 + 2y = 10, so 2y = 10, so y=5. So answer C is indeed correct.

But wait, let me see the problem. The answer options given in the question are A) 20, B)3, C)5, D)2.5. So yes, the correct answer is C.

But what might have led to incorrect options? Let me think about possible mistakes students could make here. Let's look at each option:

A) 20: This could be a student who instead solved for x instead of y. If they thought "since y is the variable we solve for", but maybe mistakenly solved for 4x + 4y = something. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, they might have thought to multiply the other side by the constant. Wait, perhaps a calculation mistake here. If someone sees the equation 4x + 2y = 10, and x=0. Then, plugging x=0 gives 0 + 2y = 10. If the student forgot that multiplication by 0, then 2y=10 would give y=5. A student might think, "Wait, the number in y has to be bigger, maybe multiply 2 times something." Wait, but in this case 2y = 10 gives 5. So maybe student confusion arises from misunderstanding the equation. Another mistake could be if a student thought they could divide directly from coefficients. For example, 4x part when x=0, but maybe they subtract something incorrectly. I don't see how 20 comes up here. Maybe if they thought, "the equation equals 10, so y should be 10 divided by something," but with 2 in front. So for example, student might think 10 divided by 1 (if they thought x=2 then they need to do 0 and 2y=10)? Wait, x=0 here. Another possibility is if they ignored the coefficient of x. For example, if the student thought for some reason when x=0, y would be equal to something in the equation that doesn't consider the coefficient.

Wait, if the student miscalculates 2y=10. Then y=5. But why would someone say 20? Unless they added incorrectly. For example, 4x part is zero, but maybe they thought 10 divided by 4. But that's 2.5. Alternatively, they made an error in rearrangement. Wait, if they thought that solving for y: 2y = 4
