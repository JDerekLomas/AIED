Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The question is about finding the radius of a sphere given its volume. The volume formula for a sphere is V = (4/3)πr³. So students need to rearrange this formula to solve for the radius (r) in terms of volume (V).

First, let me correct the formula algebraically. Start with:

V = (4/3)πr³ → Then, solving for r:

Multiply both sides by 3/4π to get r³ = 3V/(4π). Wait, that would be 3V/(4π), so then taking cube roots gives r = cube root of (3V/(4π)). Let me check.

Wait another way: To isolate r³, divide both sides by (4/3)π. Dividing V by (4/3π) is the same as multiplying V by (3)/(4π). So r³ = 3V/(4π). Then r is the cube root of that: cube root[3V/(4π)].

So the correct option should be one that is cube root(3V divide 4π). Looking at the options:

A) Cube root of (4Vπ/3). Hmm, that's putting numerator and denominator flipped. Wait, because when I solved for r³, the denominator ends up with 4π. If someone inverts that, maybe they end up with 4V divided by 3π? Wait:

Wait, original step error: if students make a mistake during inversion, maybe they do:

Given V = (4/3)πr³, they might multiply both sides by 3 first to get 3V = 4πr³, then divide by 4π to get r³ = (3V)/(4π). Then take cube root. So the correct answer would be cube root of (3V/(4π)). Let me check the answer choices.

Option C is cube root(3V/(4π)), so C is the correct answer.

Now, for each student ability level:

For below_basic: These students might struggle with rearranging the formula. They could have forgotten the volume formula or make algebraic errors when solving for r. For example, maybe they invert the coefficients or forget to adjust both 4 and pi. If someone forgets to multiply by 3 and divide by 4pi correctly, perhaps they choose A or B which are similar but flipped. If they do cube root directly on the whole formula without inversion, they might mix up numerator and denominator. Let's see.

Below-basic students may have a 20% chance for correct, maybe 80% wrong. They might think the formula is cube root(4/3 π V over something) or reverse numerator and denominator. For example, if they think r³ = 4V/(3π), then r would be B. Alternatively, maybe they think r³ is 3V/4π (correct) but messed up cube roots. Wait, option C would be the cube root of that term. But if a student makes a mistake in solving, maybe they get a different numerator or denominator.

Wait, if the formula was rearranged as r = cube root(3V/(4π)), then C would be the correct one. So students may select wrong ones due to sign confusion. Let me think about how the answer option looks.

Option A: root3[(4V pi)/3]. If the student forgot to divide by pi when solving for r³, so they do V multiplied by 3/4π without inverting the denominator pi, maybe they left out pi. Or if their rearrangement steps were wrong. But how?

Wait, solving V = (4/3)π r³, so multiply both sides by 3/(4π): 3V/(4π) = r³ → correct. So, if someone messed that up and instead did 4π V = 3 r³? Then divided 4πV /3 = r³. Then r = cube root(4πV/3). That's option A. So A would be correct here if the student messed up the inversion. So a common mistake is inverting the fraction. So those errors would lead to option A being selected instead of C.

So, the incorrect options are A (swapped 4/3 and 3/(4π)) and maybe B which is cube root(4V/(3π)) but that could be another mistake where you didn't correctly invert the multiplication over pi? Hmm.

Alternatively, if a student cancels π out, which is sometimes common. For example, if they thought the volume formula is 4/3 r³ instead of 4/3 π r³. Then when solving V = 4/3 r³ → r³ = (3V}/4), leading to cube root(3V/4
