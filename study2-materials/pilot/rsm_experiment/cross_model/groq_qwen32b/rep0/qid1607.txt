Alright, let me break this down. The question is about solving the equation $15 = \frac{1 + k}{4}$. Isaac's steps are multiplying 15 by 4 to get 60 (Step 1) and then adding 1 to get 61 (Step 2). We need to evaluate whether each of his steps is correct.

First, Step 1: 15 = (1 + k)/4. The correct initial step would be to multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator. So multiplying 15 * 4 = 60 is correct, leading to 60 = 1 + k. So Step 1 is right.

Step 2: To isolate k, you subtract 1 from both sides, resulting in k = 60 - 1, which is 59. But Isaac subtracts 1 from the left instead? Wait, no. If you have 60 = 1 + k, subtract 1 on both sides to get k. The correct action is to move k to the left and subtract 1 from both sides, or more directly, subtract 1. However, here he moves the k first and then adds 1 to both sides instead of subtracting 1. Wait, wait. Let's see Step 2: He takes the result of Step 1 (60) and says that leads to Step 2: 61 = k. How? If 60 = 1 + k, he's adding 1 to the 60? That would imply subtracting 1 from both sides if it were correct. But instead, adding 1 here would be incorrect. So his Step 2 is wrong because to solve for k, he needs to subtract 1 from 60 to get k = 59. Instead, he's doing 60 + 1 = 61 = k, which is adding 1 instead of subtracting. That's a common algebra mistake—when you move a term from subtrahend or addend, you accidentally flip the sign. Students might mistake the direction: 60 = 1 +k. So k = 60 -1 =59, but he might have reversed the direction. Maybe they're used to moving variables with multiplication, like 15*4. So in this case, the error in Step 2 is due to subtracting instead of adding? Wait, no. Wait: If you have k + 1 = 60, then subtracting 1 from both sides gives k = 59. So in Step 2, he adds 1 instead of subtracting, resulting in k=61. So Step 2 is incorrect. So Step 1 is correct, Step 2 is incorrect. Therefore, only Step 1 is correct. The correct answer is A) Only step 1.

Now, considering real student errors: The equation is straightforward in structure but requires basic inverse operations. For Step 1, the multiplicative inverse is correct. Step 2 involves the error of adding instead of subtracting. However, is this a common mistake?

At the basic level (perhaps Year 7 or 8), students often struggle with inverse operations. Step 1 involves multiplication, which is more intuitive, but Step 2 might trick them if they don't handle subtraction correctly. At higher ability groups, they're likely to recognize that solving for k requires subtracting 1, not adding. However, since the equation is simple, maybe fewer mistakes, but the trick is that in step 2, he seems to add. For example, when students reverse operations when solving for variables, that's a known error. For weaker students, the error in Step 2 is more plausible, but maybe for advanced students, this is a straightforward mistake.

So the distribution per ability:

Below basic students (weaker): They might not understand both steps. They might think both steps are correct due to not seeing the inverse error. But some might see Step 1 is correct. Maybe higher chance for choosing Step 1. However, in the context of the question, they have to evaluate correctness step by step. If they can't get through Step 1 correctly, they might pick D, but Step 1 is easy.

Basic: Maybe similar. Step 1 is likely thought correct (they've done multiplying both sides). However, when evaluating Step 2, they might think adding 1 is correct? If they made this error when solving similar problems.

Proficient: These have a better grasp but maybe sometimes confused if the signs flip? For example, they might see in k +1 =60, subtract 1 gets k=59. Isaac wrote k=61, so they'd spot the mistake and select Answer A.

Advanced: Clear that Step 1 is correct, so Step 2 is wrong. They'd likely answer A.
