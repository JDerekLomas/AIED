Alright, let's tackle this question. The bracket is written out as (2p - 1)(3p - 4), with arrows pointing from -1 to -4. So we need to multiply these two terms.

First, I know when expanding brackets, each term in the first bracket is multiplied by each term in the second. The usual method could be FOIL or using the distributive law. The arrows specifically point to -1 and -4, which are parts of the first and second brackets. Since Molly is multiplying these two terms, she needs to multiply -1 by -4. 

Multiplying two negative numbers usually gives a positive result. The product of (-1)(-4) should be +4. So option A is 4, option B is -4 (which would be incorrectly selecting the product with a wrong sign). C and D mention 5, though that doesn't seem to come up unless there's a computational mistake beyond sign recognition. Let's say there are students who multiply the constants -1 and -4 correctly (as 1*4=4, and negatives cancel), getting option A. Those mixing up signs might put 0, but no option is given. So B is a tempting error: they might say minus 4 (incorrectly keeping both negatives) but that would be wrong. 

At higher ability levels, students might be less likely to make sign errors. So basic learners might have lower percentages picking A, while advanced students would have higher A percentages. For others, maybe C or D would occur only if mixing up addition instead of multiplication (sum would be -(-1)+(-4)= -3 or sum as (2p*-4) part, but here it's just multiplication. C is +5, but that wouldn't come up from standard errors. D, -5 would imply wrong signs or another calculation path. But perhaps in this setup, the error of selecting positive sign and then wrong answer doesn't come up. 

So, maybe C and D are very low percentages, as errors in applying signs wouldn't lead to 5 or -5 in this problem context. Therefore, majority at each ability level will either get A or B depending on their knowledge. So A correct answer is +4, and if a common mistake is selecting -4, then C and D are negligible. But how likely are students to make this sign mistake when multiplying the two negatives? If it's a common slip-up, even at higher levels, maybe a certain percent do. I think maybe B=20%, A=70% at high prof; perhaps lower percentages for lower ability. Need to balance based on prior experience with students.
