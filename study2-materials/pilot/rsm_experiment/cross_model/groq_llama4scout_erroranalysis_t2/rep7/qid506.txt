## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential mistakes
The question requires solving the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) for \(p\). To solve it correctly, one must divide both sides by 3, yielding \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 2: Identify common errors for each wrong answer
- Option A (\(p = \frac{1}{4}\)) could result from incorrectly multiplying \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3 instead of dividing, or from a misunderstanding of the division by 3.
- Option C (\(p = 4\)) seems to come from a miscalculation where \(\frac{1}{12} \div 3\) is incorrectly solved, possibly by inverting the division and then getting it wrong, or misunderstanding the operation.
- Option D (\(p = \frac{1}{9}\)) might come from a calculation like \(\frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\) which seems not directly related but could indicate a confusion in operations.

## 3: Evaluate the "attractiveness" of each wrong answer
- Option A (\(p = \frac{1}{4}\)) could be attractive if students mistakenly think they need to multiply by 3 or get confused with common fractions.
- Option C (\(p = 4\)) seems less likely as it involves a large increase, which might be recognizable as incorrect by more capable students.
- Option D (\(p = \frac{1}{9}\)) could be considered if students incorrectly perform the division or multiplication.

## 4: Consider student ability levels and likely errors
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to make significant calculation errors. They might choose A or C due to confusion in basic arithmetic operations.
- **Basic**: Students at this level might understand the need to divide but could get the calculation wrong, potentially leading to choosing A or D due to miscalculations.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to solve the equation correctly but might be tempted by A if they misunderstand division by 3.
- **Advanced**: These students are less likely to make simple arithmetic errors and are more likely to choose the correct answer, B.

## 5: Estimate percentages based on common errors and student understanding
Given the nature of the question and common mistakes:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (simple multiplication error), B=10% (unlikely to get it right), C=30% (misunderstanding of division), D=20% (another miscalculation).
- **Basic**: A=30% (confusion with multiplication), B=20% (gets it right or simple error), C=15% (significant miscalculation), D=35% (nearly correct but incorrect calculation).
- **Proficient**: A=20% (some still confused), B=70% (most get it right), C=5% (less likely to make significant errors), D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=5% (rarely mistaken), B=90% (accurately solve), C=2% (very rare error), D=3%.

## 6: Translate estimates into the required format
Based on logical deductions and understanding of typical student errors:
- below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%
- basic: A=30% B=20% C=15% D=35%
- proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
- advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
