## Step 1: Understanding the question and potential errors
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct method involves using the FOIL technique (First, Outer, Inner, Last) or expanding the brackets directly. The correct answer is \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 2: Identifying potential errors and attractive wrong answers
- Option A: \(m^2 - 2m - 35\). This could result from incorrect application of FOIL, possibly missing the correct multiplication of the inner and outer terms.
- Option B: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\). This is the correct answer.
- Option C: \(m^2 + 12m + 35\). This might come from adding the terms inside the brackets instead of subtracting, or a mistaken sign.
- Option D: \(m^2 - 12m - 35\). This could occur from incorrectly subtracting or adding the constants and/or the \(m\) terms.

## 3: Analyzing error types and student likelihood of making them
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly apply operations or forget to distribute. Errors leading to A, C, or D are plausible due to confusion with signs or operations.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may make careless mistakes. They might choose A or D due to miscalculation of terms.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the method but may make errors due to rushing or oversight. Incorrect signs (leading to C or D) could happen, but B is likely the most common answer.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are likely to get the correct answer, B, but might occasionally make errors if they misinterpret the signs or operations.

## 4: Estimating percentages based on error types and student abilities
- **Below Basic**: 
  - A: Students might choose this due to not fully understanding the FOIL method, so 40%.
  - B: Correct answer, but less likely to achieve, so 20%.
  - C: Adding instead of subtracting could lead to 20%.
  - D: Another plausible mistake, 20%.
- **Basic**:
  - A: 30%, due to straightforward multiplication errors.
  - B: 40%, as this group has a better grasp but may still make simple errors.
  - C: 15%, possibly from incorrect handling of negative numbers.
  - D: 15%, similar errors to C.
- **Proficient**:
  - A: 10%, minor calculation mistakes.
  - B: 80%, good understanding and application.
  - C: 5%, rare but could happen with sign errors.
  - D: 5%, similar to C.
- **Advanced**:
  - A: 5%, very occasional careless mistake.
  - B: 90%, confident and accurate application.
  - C: 2.5%, unlikely but could occur with very minor oversight.
  - D: 2.5%, similarly unlikely.

## 5: Concretizing predictions
Given the analysis, let's translate the thoughts into percentages, keeping in mind the understanding and common errors at each level:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- **Basic**: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
- **Proficient**: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=5% B=90% C=2.5% D=2.5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2.5% D=2.5%
