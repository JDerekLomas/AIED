## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question asks students to identify which calculation will give the correct mean of the numbers 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. The mean is calculated by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the count of the numbers.

## 2: Identifying the correct calculation
The correct calculation for the mean is \( \frac{0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7}{5} \). This matches option A if we include 0 in the sum: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) is incorrect because it excludes 0, but let's evaluate the options given.

## 3: Analyzing option A
Option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). This option is incorrect because it excludes the 0 from the summation.

## 4: Analyzing option B
Option B is \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \). Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), this would actually calculate as \( 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + \frac{7}{5} \), which is clearly incorrect for calculating the mean.

## 5: Analyzing option C
Option C is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \). This option is incorrect because it excludes 0 from the summation and also divides by 4 (the number of non-zero values) instead of 5 (the total number of values).

## 6: Analyzing option D
Option D states "None of them". Given that option A is flawed because it misses the 0, option B misinterprets the order of operations for the task, and option C both misses the 0 and uses the wrong divisor, option D could be considered correct if none of the provided calculations accurately represent the mean.

## 7: Predicting student responses
- **Below_basic**: These students may struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of mean. They might be attracted to option B because it seems to include all numbers and perform division, albeit incorrectly. Option A might seem correct to some because it involves division by 5, which is the number of items. Option C could appeal due to its simplicity. However, given the lack of understanding, many might choose A or B due to their simplicity and seeming relevance. A=30%, B=40%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: These students understand the concept of mean but might make calculation errors. They are likely to recognize that 0 must be included and that division by 5 is correct, but may not notice the mistake in A. Option B might still seem plausible due to careless reading. A=50%, B=25%, C=15%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students should recognize that the sum must include 0 and that division by 5 is necessary. They might be tempted by A but recognize its flaw. B and C should be obviously incorrect. A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: These students will easily identify A as incorrect due to missing 0 but understand the structure of the mean calculation. They should see through B and C immediately. A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% because they know the correct formula isn't listed but understand what it should look like.

## 8: Adjusting predictions based on common mistakes
Given common errors, below_basic students often fall for what "looks right" without calculating. Basic students might actually compute parts correctly but err in details. Proficient and advanced students are less likely to fall for glaring errors.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
