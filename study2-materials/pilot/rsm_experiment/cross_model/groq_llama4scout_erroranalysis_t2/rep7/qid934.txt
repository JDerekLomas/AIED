## Step 1: Understand the question and the table of values
The table of values is for the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\). We need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\), which is represented by \(\color{gold}\bigstar \).

## 2: Solve the equation for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\):
\(4(0) + 2y = 10\)
\(2y = 10\)
\(y = 5\)

## 3: Identify the correct answer
The correct answer is \(y = 5\) when \(x = 0\), which corresponds to option C.

## 4: Analyze potential calculation errors for each wrong option
- Option A: \(20\). This could result from \(4x + 2y = 10\) being solved as \(2y = 10 \times 4 = 40\) when \(x = 0\), leading to \(y = 20\). This error involves incorrectly multiplying the entire equation by 4.
- Option B: \(3\). This might come from solving \(2y = 10 - 4x\) and then incorrectly calculating \(y = (10 - 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\) when \(x = 1\), not \(x = 0\), or simply guessing.
- Option D: \(2.5\). This could result from \(2y = 10 - 4x\) and then \(y = (10 - 0) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5\) when using \(4x\) instead of \(2y\) for substitution, or other algebraic manipulation errors.

## 5: Consider the attractiveness of wrong answers and student errors
- Students below basic might not understand how to substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation or make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- Basic students might understand substitution but make calculation errors.
- Proficient students are likely to solve it correctly but might be distracted by common errors.
- Advanced students are expected to solve it correctly with minimal errors.

## 6: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below Basic**: Might choose A due to confusion or overcomplication (20%), B due to simple mistakes or not attempting the question properly (10%), C if they manage to solve it correctly with some struggle (30%), and D if they try to use a formula directly but mess up (40%).
- **Basic**: Likely to choose C if they solve it correctly (60%), A or D if they make a significant error in substitution or calculation (20% each), and B if their error is minimal but not quite there (20%).
- **Proficient**: Expected to choose C correctly (80%), A or D if they make a neat but wrong algebraic manipulation (10% each), and B if their error is small (10%).
- **Advanced**: Should almost all choose C correctly (95%), with small percentages potentially choosing A or D out of curiosity or if they write down an incorrect check (2.5% each), and B rarely (5%).

## 7: Final estimation based on typical student performance
Based on these considerations and typical student performance:
- **below_basic**: A=15% B=20% C=40% D=25%
- **basic**: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- **advanced**: A=2% B=2% C=94% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=94% D=2%
