## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors.
The question requires comparing two expressions: $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$. The correct comparison involves understanding the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 2: Calculate the correct values for each expression.
First, calculate $8+12 \div 4$: Following BODMAS, $12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8 + 3 = 11$.
Next, calculate $(8+12) \div 4$: Following BODMAS, $8+12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.
So, $8+12 \div 4 = 11$ and $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$.

## 3: Determine the correct symbol.
Since $11 > 5$, the correct symbol to use is $>$.

## 4: Identify common errors and attractive wrong methods.
- A common error is to ignore BODMAS and perform operations from left to right or not following the order of operations correctly.
- For $8+12 \div 4$, some might calculate $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$ (wrong because they ignore BODMAS), leading them to think the expressions are equal.
- Another error could be adding $8$ and $12$ first for the first expression, which doesn't apply here but indicates a misunderstanding of BODMAS.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to not understand or apply BODMAS correctly. They might calculate both expressions incorrectly or not at all, leading to random or equal choices due to lack of understanding. So, they might choose $C= $ (Equality) assuming both are the same due to incorrect calculation or $A=$ or $B=$ randomly.

- **Basic**: Basic level students might have a flawed understanding of BODMAS. They could incorrectly calculate $8+12 \div 4$ as $(8+12) \div 4$ or vice versa, leading them to choose $C=$. Some might choose $A$ or $B$ based on incorrect assumptions.

- **Proficient**: Proficient students generally understand BODMAS but might make calculation errors under pressure. They are likely to choose $A=$ (>) if they calculate correctly. Incorrect choices might come from miscalculation.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students are expected to understand and apply BODMAS correctly and are less likely to make simple computational errors. They should predominantly choose $A=$ (>).

## 6: Estimate percentages based on typical student performance.
- **Below Basic**: Given their lack of understanding, they might lean towards $C (=$) due to a misconception that both sides are equal without calculation or due to very basic misunderstandings. $A=30\%$, $B=20\%$, $C=40\%$, $D=10\%$.
- **Basic**: These students may still struggle with applying BODMAS consistently, so they might choose $C= ($Equality) more frequently. $A=40\%$, $B=25\%$, $C=30\%$, $D=5\%$.
- **Proficient**: Students here are expected to mostly get it right but might have a slip-up. $A=70\%$, $B=15\%$, $C=10\%$, $D=5\%$.
- **Advanced**: They are likely to almost all choose $A$. $A=90\%$, $B=5\%$, $C=3\%$, $D=2\%$.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
