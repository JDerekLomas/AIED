## Step 1: Understanding the question and the methods
The question presents an equation: \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) and asks students to evaluate two proposed next lines of working: \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \) by Tom, and \( x - 5 = 36 \) by Katie. To assess who is correct, we need to understand the algebraic manipulation involved.

## 2: Evaluating Tom's suggestion
Tom suggests \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). This can be obtained by adding 5 to both sides of the equation \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \), which is a correct algebraic operation: \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5 \), resulting in \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). So, Tom is correct.

## 3: Evaluating Katie's suggestion
Katie suggests \( x - 5 = 36 \). To see if this is a correct next step, we multiply every term in the original equation by 3 to clear the fraction: \( \frac{x}{3} \times 3 - 5 \times 3 = 12 \times 3 \), which gives \( x - 15 = 36 \). Katie's suggestion of \( x - 5 = 36 \) does not match this correct manipulation. It seems Katie might have mistakenly multiplied only \( x \) and not the entire equation by 3, or she added 5 instead of multiplying by 3. So, Katie is incorrect.

## 4: Identifying calculation errors for wrong answers
- For option B (Only Katie), students might incorrectly validate Katie's step or incorrectly dismiss Tom's.
- For option C (Both Tom and Katie), students would need to incorrectly validate Katie's step as correct alongside recognizing Tom's as correct.
- For option D (Neither is correct), students would need to incorrectly dismiss both suggestions.

## 5: Assessing student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and could easily fall into traps. They might choose B or D because they don't understand how to validate either suggestion correctly.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of simple algebra but might make careless mistakes. They could choose B if they mistakenly think Katie's method is valid or D if they see through Katie's but not Tom's.
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebraic manipulations well and are less likely to fall into common traps. They should recognize Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrectness, choosing A.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and can easily see the correctness of Tom's statement and the incorrectness of Katie's.

## 6: Predicting percentages
Given the nature of the question:
- **Below Basic**: Might have trouble understanding algebraic manipulations, so A=20% (understand Tom), B=30% (mistakenly think Katie), C=10% (think both), D=40% (think neither).
- **Basic**: Have a basic understanding, so A=50% (recognize Tom), B=20% (mistake on Katie), C=10% (both), D=20% (neither).
- **Proficient**: Understand algebra well, so A=80% (see Tom's correctness), B=5% (error on Katie), C=5% (both), D=10% (neither).
- **Advanced**: Excellent understanding, so A=95% (clearly see Tom), B=0% (no mistake on Katie), C=0% (no confusion), D=5% (rarely, a misinterpretation).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
