To approach this question, let's first analyze the options and the common mistakes students might make.

The correct answer is A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), as it properly represents \( c \div(h+4) \) using algebraic conventions.

- Option B) \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \) might result from a misconception where students add 4 to \( c \) in the numerator, possibly due to confusion with adding/subtracting fractions or misunderstanding the order of operations.
- Option C) \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \) could result from misinterpreting the division as implying two separate operations: dividing \( c \) by \( h \) and then adding 4, which might seem a natural or intuitive step to some but actually misrepresents the original expression.
- Option D) \( \frac{h+4}{c} \) seems to stem from a basic misunderstanding of division, possibly confusing \( c \div (h+4) \) with \( (h+4) \div c \).

Considering these errors and the typical algebraic understanding at different levels:

## Step 1: Understanding Student Errors
- Students below the basic level may struggle to even represent simple algebraic expressions and could randomly select an answer or follow an incorrect pattern they've seen before.
- Basic level students might choose B or C due to not fully grasping the convention for representing division and possibly mistaking it for operations with exponents or additions/subtractions within the fraction.
- Proficient students are expected to know the algebraic conventions well and thus would mostly choose A, but some might still fall into the trap of C, especially under timed conditions or if they are used to calculating with numbers rather than variables.
- Advanced students would confidently choose A, with fewer likely to fall for the erroneous options.

## 2: Allocating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: Expect a wide spread of incorrect answers. These students might struggle to understand algebraic notation, leading to A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: These students have a grasp of basics but may apply them loosely. Anticipating more will get it wrong than right: A=40%, B=30%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Having a solid foundation, most should choose A correctly, with errors commonly found in C: A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A very high likelihood of choosing A, minimizing errors: A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%.

## 3: Final Predictions
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
- **basic**: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
