To tackle this, let's consider the common errors students make when adding fractions, particularly with algebraic denominators.

## Step 1: Understand the Correct Answer
The correct way to add these fractions is to find a common denominator. For \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \), the common denominator is \(2x\). So, we convert \( \frac{4}{x} \) to \( \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{8}{2x} \). Then, \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \). So, the correct answer is A: \( \frac{11}{2x} \).

## 2: Analyze Option B - \( \frac{7}{3x} \)
To get \( \frac{7}{3x} \), a student might incorrectly find a common denominator as \(3x\) and then add the fractions as \( \frac{3 \times 3}{2x \times 3} + \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{9}{6x} + \frac{8}{2x} \), but then mistakenly add them directly without finding a common denominator properly or by adding \( \frac{3}{2x} \) and \( \frac{4}{x} \) and getting \( \frac{3+8}{3x} \) if they incorrectly used \(3x\) as a common denominator without adjusting the fractions properly. This seems a bit implausible without a direct calculation mistake.

## 3: Analyze Option C - \( \frac{11}{x} \)
For \( \frac{11}{x} \), a student might mistakenly add the fractions without accounting for the \(2\) in the \(2x\) denominator of the first fraction. They might do \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3 + 4 \times 2}{x} = \frac{3 + 8}{x} = \frac{11}{x} \), essentially ignoring the \(2\) in \(2x\) or incorrectly cancelling/misusing it.

## 4: Analyze Option D - \( \frac{7}{2x} \)
This option could result from incorrectly adding \(3 + 4 = 7\) without considering the denominators, leading to \( \frac{7}{2x} \), which seems like a simplistic error.

## 5: Consider Student Errors by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students here might not grasp basic fraction addition or algebraic manipulation. They are more likely to make straightforward addition errors or completely misunderstand the concept (High chance for C and D).
- **Basic**: These students have a foundational understanding but are prone to careless calculation errors. They might end up with A or make significant errors leading to C or D.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand the concept but may still make minor calculation errors. The incorrect options might attract them less, but B could be a trap if they're confused about common denominators.
- **Advanced**: These students have a solid grasp and are less likely to fall into basic traps, making A the likely choice.

## 6: Predictions Based on Likely Errors
Given the nature of each error and typical student misunderstandings:
- **Below Basic**: A=10% (little to no understanding of adding fractions), B=5% (some attempt at a common denominator but incorrectly applied), C=30% (direct addition ignoring denominators), D=55% (adds numerators and one denominator directly).
- **Basic**: A=40% (some correct understanding), B=15% ( tries common denominator but fails), C=25% ( addition mistake), D=20% (adds directly).
- **Proficient**: A=70% (solid understanding), B=10% (confusion with common denominators), C=10% (simple algebraic mistake), D=10% (rare algebraic mistakes).
- **Advanced**: A=90% (secure understanding and application), B=5% (rare errors), C=3% (algebraic confusion), D=2% (minimal calculation error).

The best answer is A. 

Given those considerations, here are my best estimates:
below_basic: A=10% B=5% C=30% D=55%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
