To tackle this, let's analyze the problems and the common errors students might make.

## Step 1: Understanding the Operations and Order of Operations
Problem P involves simple addition and subtraction: \(4 - 5 + 6\). According to the order of operations, we perform operations from left to right when there are no brackets or higher-order operations (exponents, etc.). So, for Problem P, the correct sequence is \(4 - 5 + 6\), which means we first do \(4 - 5\).

## 2: Analyzing Problem Q
Problem Q involves multiplication and addition: \(4 + 5 \times 6\). According to the order of operations (often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS/BPEMDAS, which stands for Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction), multiplication should be performed before addition. So, for Problem Q, we first do \(5 \times 6\).

## 3: Evaluating the Options
- For Problem P, the operation to do first is \(4 - 5\), which corresponds to option A or B.
- For Problem Q, the operation to do first is \(5 \times 6\), which corresponds to option B or D.

## 4: Predicted Student Responses
Given the question asks which calculation should be done first in each problem, let's evaluate the options directly:
- A: Problem P: \(4-5\); Problem Q: \(4+5\). Incorrect for Q because \(5 \times 6\) should be done first.
- B: Problem P: \(4-5\); Problem Q: \(5 \times 6\). Correct for both.
- C: Problem P: \(5+6\); Problem Q: \(4+5\). Incorrect for both because of misunderstanding the order of operations.
- D: Problem P: \(5+6\); Problem Q: \(5 \times 6\). Incorrect for P.

## 5: Considering Student Errors and Abilities
- **Below Basic**: Students might not understand the order of operations at all or make basic calculation errors. They might choose C or D because they incorrectly prioritize operations or ignore the question about the order.
- **Basic**: Students understand simple operations but might struggle with the concept of following an order of operations strictly. They might lean towards A or C, having a partial understanding but making mistakes.
- **Proficient**: Students should know to follow the order of operations. They are likely to choose B as it correctly states the operations to perform first in both cases.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the order of operations but are also likely to apply it correctly without error, choosing B.

## 6: Predicting Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (partial understanding), B=30% (some understanding of correct order), C=30% (wrong order, addition/subtraction or misinterpretation), D=20% (completely wrong, prioritizing addition in P).
- **Basic**: A=40% (common mistake, add/subtract first), B=50% (understands correct sequence), C=5% (unlikely to confuse this much), D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=10% (some confusion), B=85% (correct understanding), C=3% (mistake), D=2%.
- **Advanced**: A=0% (no confusion), B=95% (easily identifies correct sequence), C=0%, D=5%.

Here's a detailed prediction based on typical student performance:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=50% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=85% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
