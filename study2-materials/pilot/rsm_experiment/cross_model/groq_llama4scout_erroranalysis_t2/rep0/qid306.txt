To approach this question, let's analyze the problems and the typical errors students might make, considering the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## Problem P: \( 4-5+6= \)
In this problem, students should perform the operations from left to right: first \( 4-5 \) and then add \( 6 \). So, the correct order is \( 4-5 \) first.

## Problem Q: \( 4+5 \times 6= \)
Following the order of operations, multiplication comes before addition, so \( 5 \times 6 \) should be calculated first.

## Analysis of Options:
- A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - Incorrect for Q because it suggests adding first.
- B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Correct order for both.
- C: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - Incorrect for both; suggests wrong operations to prioritize.
- D: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Incorrect for P; correctly prioritizes Q.

## Predicting Student Responses:
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level often lack understanding of the order of operations. They might randomly select or follow an incorrect, intuitive sequence. Option A might seem natural because it starts with the first numbers in sequence but doesn't apply the rules correctly. Option D seems wrong for P but right for Q. So, \( \text{below\_basic: A=40\% B=20\% C=20\% D=20\%} \)
- **Basic:** Basic level students have some understanding but may struggle applying rules consistently. They might choose A or C due to not fully understanding the order of operations. So, \( \text{basic: A=30\% B=40\% C=20\% D=10\%} \)
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand and can apply the order of operations well. They should mostly choose B. So, \( \text{proficient: A=10\% B=80\% C=5\% D=5\%} \)
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand but can also explain the reasoning. Almost all should choose B. So, \( \text{advanced: A=5\% B=90\% C=2\% D=3\%} \)

The best answer is B.
