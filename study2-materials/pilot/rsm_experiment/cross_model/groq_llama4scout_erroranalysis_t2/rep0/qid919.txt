## Step 1: Understand the question and the equation given
The equation provided is $y = 3x^2$, and we need to find the value of $y$ when $x = 0.3$. The correct calculation is $y = 3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

## 2: Identify the wrong answers and potential calculation errors
- Option A: $0.81$ could result from $3 \times 0.3^2 = 3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$, but if a student mistakenly calculated $0.3^2 = 0.27$ and then $3 \times 0.27 = 0.81$, this could be a plausible mistake.
- Option B: $0.27$ is the correct answer, as calculated in Step 1.
- Option C: $1.8$ could result from mistakenly calculating $3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$, implying a student used $x = 0.6$ instead of $x = 0.3$ or made a calculation error.
- Option D: $2.7$ could result from $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then somehow getting $2.7$, but straightforwardly, it could be $0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$ if a student incorrectly calculated $(0.3)^2 = 0.9$.

## 3: Analyze potential calculation errors leading to each wrong answer
- A common error for lower ability students might be not squaring the $0.3$, leading to $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, but none of the options directly match this simple mistake. However, $0.9 \times 3 = 2.7$ suggests an error in squaring or in calculation.
- For A ($0.81$), if a student thought $0.3^2 = 0.27$, they'd get this, indicating a miscalculation.
- For C ($1.8$), this might come from misusing $x = 0.6$ or similar.
- For D ($2.7$), a straightforward error could be mistaking $x$ or miscalculating the exponent.

## 4: Consider the "attractiveness" of wrong answers and student likely hood to catch errors
- More able students are less likely to make basic calculation errors and more likely to notice if their answer doesn't look right.
- Lower ability students might not double-check their work or use calculators inefficiently.

## 5: Estimate the distribution based on experience
Given 200 papers and considering typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: These students often struggle with basic arithmetic. They might confuse operations or miscalculate significantly. Expect a higher chance of incorrect answers across the board, especially with calculation errors.
- **Basic**: Students here understand the basics but may struggle with application or complex calculations. They might not recognize when their calculation is wrong.
- **Proficient** and **Advanced** students are more likely to get the correct answer or realize their mistake.

## 6: Predict percentages for each option at each ability level
- **Below Basic**: Might have high rates of error. D ($2.7$) could be attractive if they just multiplied $3*0.3$. A ($0.81$) could come from squaring $0.3$ incorrectly or a similar error. 
- **Basic**: Might still fall into straightforward calculation traps.
- **Proficient** and **Advanced**: Should largely avoid simple arithmetic mistakes.

The best answer is below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=60% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
