## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors
The question requires students to compare the results of two expressions: \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\). The correct approach is to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 2: Calculate the expressions correctly
First, calculate \(8+12 \div 4\):
- Division first: \(12 \div 4 = 3\)
- Then addition: \(8 + 3 = 11\)

Then, calculate \((8+12) \div 4\):
- Evaluate inside the parentheses: \(8 + 12 = 20\)
- Then division: \(20 \div 4 = 5\)

So, \(8+12 \div 4 = 11\) and \((8+12) \div 4 = 5\). Therefore, \(11 > 5\), meaning the correct symbol is \(>\).

## 3: Identify common errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error is to ignore the order of operations or misunderstand it. For example, calculating \(8 + 12 \div 4\) as \(20 \div 4 = 5\), which would incorrectly suggest \(=, <,\) or \(\geq\) if not evaluating \((8+12) \div 4\) correctly. 
- Another error is to add first in the second expression: \((8+12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5\) is correct, but some might mistakenly think \(8 + 12 = 20\) and then compare incorrectly if their first expression's result is misunderstood.
- Students might also wrongly assume the operations are commutative or associative in a way that doesn't apply here.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to make significant calculation errors and not follow the order of operations properly. They might calculate everything from left to right or make errors in basic arithmetic. Given the complexity and their likely misunderstanding of order of operations, they'd be more likely to choose \(C =\) or \(B <\) due to incorrect calculations or no calculation at all.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but may still struggle with applying the order of operations consistently. They might choose \(C =\) if they incorrectly think the operations yield the same result or choose \(B <\) if they understand the second expression but not the first correctly.

- **Proficient**: These students are expected to understand and apply the order of operations but might still make careless mistakes. They're less likely to choose \(C =\) or \(D \geq\) but might be tempted by \(B <\) if they recognize the difference but miscalculate.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to calculate both expressions correctly and choose \(A >\).

## 5: Estimate percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (some get it right by chance), B=40% (think the second is larger, incorrectly), C=25% (think they're equal), D=5% (unlikely to consider \(\geq\)).
- **Basic**: A=50% (start to get the hang of it), B=30% (still some errors), C=15% (less think they're equal), D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=80% (mostly understand), B=15% (some careless mistakes), C=4% (rarely think equal), D=1%.
- **Advanced**: A=95% (nearly all get it), B=4% (very few errors), C=1% (rare), D=0%.

The best answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=25% D=5%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
