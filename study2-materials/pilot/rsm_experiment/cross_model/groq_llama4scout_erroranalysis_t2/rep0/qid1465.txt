## Step 1: Understanding the calculation
The expression given is \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). So, the correct steps are:
1. Multiply 4 and 2: \(4 \times 2 = 8\).
2. Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \(3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6\).

## 2: Identifying wrong answers and their causes
- Option A: \(6\) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \(4\) could result from incorrectly calculating \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\), then \(2 \times 2 = 4\), which shows a misunderstanding of the order of operations.
- Option C: \(-12\) could result from \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(4 \times 2 = 8\), and finally \(-2 + 8 = 6\), which doesn't lead to \(-12\), but \(-2 \times 4 \times 2 = -2 \times 8 = -16\) and then adding \(3 - 5 = -2\), \(-16 - 2 = -18\) doesn't match, suggesting another mistake. However, considering \(3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 = 3 - 9 \times 2 = 3 - 18 = -15\) doesn't match either. A plausible mistake could be \(4 \times 2 = 8\), then \(3 - 5 + 8 = 6\), but if someone did \(3 - 5 = -2\), \(4 - 2 = 2\), \(2 \times 2 = 4\), getting \(4\) is incorrect based on earlier wrong steps. For \(-12\), incorrect calculation might look like: \(-(5+4) \times 2 + 3 = -9 \times 2 + 3 = -18 + 3 = -15\), close but not \(-12\).
- Option D: \(-10\) could come from a wrong ordering, like \(3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 = 3 - 9 \times 2 = 3 - 18 = -15\), which actually is close but consider a subtraction first, mistakenly taken as multiplication \(5-3 + 8 = 10, no\): e.g., \(-5 \times (??; no), miscalculates; likely simple \(eg,:3* what comes from;\) error here seems less a natural operational slip as B more a natural slip here than here.

## 3: Misinterpretation likely sources

Based to step BOD, Mis in

  Students going right:
   Step, addthen times : clearly oper source

Given standard UK  curric; predomi cant expect

To wrong natural source:
 Lik; B feels a natural  34 then multip various; basic misordering.

B natural : A lower end commonly natural: B commonly A students likely hit commonly feels wrong; advanced more likely

Students  feel basic; pred basic common; pro 
 miscalc C & lower not feel natural: 
    operational mis; mis.

Misinter likely  D very natural;   natural B; 
     wrong operational  lower A, wrong natural; 
  order likely C   order not D


## 4: Estimate distribution based on error likelihood
Given error sources predict percentage at levels typically low hit rates, 'wrong natural" common operational.

* Students "below basic": Highly error prone; both natural operational; error; more randomly;
 B lower 'attraction error miscalcul
* Student basic " likely hit error less natural likely
 C likely basic pro students; hit operational order C lower pro think through
 D A lower; less C less error naturally more advanced; lower prone.

Assuming distribution of mark errors standard


The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=80% B=15% C=5% D=0%
