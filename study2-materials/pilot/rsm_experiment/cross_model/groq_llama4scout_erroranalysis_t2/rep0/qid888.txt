## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct process involves using the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) or expanding the brackets by multiplying each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Answer
The correct expansion is:
\[
(m-5)(m-7) = m(m) + m(-7) - 5(m) - 5(-7)
\]
\[
= m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35
\]
\[
= m^2 - 12m + 35
\]
So, the correct answer is B) \(m^{2}-12m+35\).

## 3: Analyzing Wrong Answers
- A) \(m^{2}-2m-35\): This could result from incorrectly adding the \(m\) terms, e.g., \(-7m - 5m = -2m\) instead of \(-12m\).
- C) \(m^{2}+12m+35\): This might come from incorrectly adding the \(m\) terms and also mistakenly making the \(m^2\) term positive while incorrectly keeping the \(+35\) (which is correct in sign but not if the \(m\) terms are incorrect).
- D) \(m^{2}-12m-35\): This error could arise from incorrectly multiplying the constants, \(-5 \times -7 = -35\) instead of \(+35\), while correctly calculating the \(m\) terms.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
## 4.1 Below Basic
Students at this level might struggle with the basic multiplication and addition/subtraction within the expansion. They are more likely to make careless errors.
- A: Likely due to simple miscalculation, e.g., incorrect addition of \(m\) terms.
- B: Unlikely, as they struggle with the fundamental steps.
- C: Plausible if they incorrectly add the \(m\) terms and mistakenly get a positive coefficient for \(m\).
- D: Plausible for similar reasons as A, focusing on the wrong constant term.

## 4.2 Basic
Basic level students understand the process but might make computational errors.
- A: Attractive because it seems like a simple mistake to make (\(-7m - 5m = -2m\)).
- B: Should be achievable with accurate calculations.
- C: Possible if there's confusion with signs or coefficients.
- D: Possible with a similar error to A but focusing on the constant.

## 4.3 Proficient
Proficient students generally grasp the method but may have a slip-up.
- A: Less likely, as they're more adept at catching errors.
- B: High likelihood, as they typically perform calculations accurately.
- C: Less likely, given understanding of FOIL or expansion method.
- D: Less likely, similarly due to understanding.

## 5. Assigning Percentages
Given the nature of the errors:

- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple errors), B=20% (achieving the right method), C=20% (sign errors), D=30% (constant errors).
- **Basic**: A=25% (calculation slip-ups), B=60% (most get it right), C=10% (coefficient mistakes), D=5% (grasping the right sign for constant).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (meticulous about detail), B=85% (good grasp), C=5% (couple of method misconceptions), D=5% (occasional mistake with constant).
- **Advanced**: A=1% (miniscule chance of very basic misunderstanding), B=95% (essentially flawless), C=1% (almost no chance of sign/coefficient mistake), D=3% (extremely rare).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=60% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
