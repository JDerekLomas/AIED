To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question is: \( 2 \frac{1}{5}+1 \frac{2}{5}= \) Leave your answer as a mixed number

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Answer
First, let's solve the problem correctly. To add mixed numbers, we add the whole parts and the fraction parts separately.
\( 2 \frac{1}{5}+1 \frac{2}{5} = (2 + 1) + \left(\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}\right) = 3 + \frac{3}{5} = 3 \frac{3}{5} \)
So, the correct answer is A) \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \).

## 2: Analyzing Potential Calculation Errors
- **Option B (\( \frac{18}{5} \))**: This could result from converting the mixed numbers into improper fractions, adding them, and then not converting back to a mixed number. \( 2 \frac{1}{5} = \frac{11}{5} \) and \( 1 \frac{2}{5} = \frac{7}{5} \), so \( \frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5} \). Students who understand the conversion but forget to convert back or are not confident with mixed numbers might choose this.
- **Option C (\( \frac{18}{10} \**)**: This option seems to come from a misunderstanding of fractions. If a student converts \( 2 \frac{1}{5} \) and \( 1 \frac{2}{5} \) into improper fractions (\( \frac{11}{5} \) and \( \frac{7}{5} \)) and then adds them to get \( \frac{18}{5} \), but then converts \( \frac{18}{5} \) into \( \frac{36}{10} \) and mistakenly writes \( \frac{18}{10} \), they might choose this. However, a more likely scenario is that they simply add the fractions \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5} \) and then add 2 and 1 to get 3, but then incorrectly convert \( \frac{3}{5} \) to \( \frac{6}{10} \) and add to get \( 3 \frac{6}{10} \) which doesn't match but shows confusion. Actually, \( \frac{18}{10} \) simplifies to \( \frac{9}{5} \) or \( 1 \frac{4}{5} \), which is not directly related to common errors in this specific question context.
- **Option D (\( 3 \frac{3}{10} \))**: This could result from students adding the fractions correctly but then making a mistake with the denominator. For example, if they calculate \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5} \) but then convert \( \frac{3}{5} \) to \( \frac{6}{10} \) and add to the whole number part incorrectly or simply get confused.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to struggle with the basics of fraction addition and conversion. They might add the whole numbers and fractions separately but make errors in adding fractions or converting. A significant portion might choose B) \( \frac{18}{5} \) because it represents a straightforward calculation without converting back to a mixed number. Some might choose D) due to confusion with fraction conversion. 
- **Basic**: These students understand the basic operations but might make careless errors. They are more likely to choose A) \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \) but could also fall into the trap of B) if they forget to convert back. Option D could also be chosen due to errors in fraction manipulation.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students are likely to get it right, choosing A) \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \). They understand mixed number addition and conversion. A small percentage might mistakenly choose B) if in a hurry or not checking their work.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to choose A) \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \) with confidence and accuracy. They are less likely to fall into common traps.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=40%, B=30%, C=10%, D=20%
- **Basic**: A=70%, B=20%, C=5%, D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=90%, B=8%, C=1%, D=1%
- **Advanced**: A=98
