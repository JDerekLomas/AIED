To solve this, let's first identify the correct calculation and then consider the common errors that might lead to the wrong answers.

The correct calculation for multiplying the terms indicated by the arrows is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## Step 1: Identify the Correct Answer
The correct answer is \(+4\), which corresponds to option A.

## 2: Analyze Potential Errors
- Option B (\(-4\)) could result from a student forgetting that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result.
- Option C (\(+5\)) and D (\(-5\)) do not directly result from a simple multiplication error of the given terms but could indicate a more significant misunderstanding or a calculation error unrelated to the specific question asked.

## 3: Consider Attractive Wrong Answers
- The answer \(-4\) (B) might be attractive to students who understand the operation but forget the rule about negative times negative.

## 4: Assess Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand the basic rules of multiplying negative numbers or might not even attempt the question correctly. They could randomly select an answer or choose based on a very basic misunderstanding.
- **Basic**: Students here would likely understand the concept of negative numbers but might make simple arithmetic mistakes or forget key rules.
- **Proficient**: These students would generally understand the rules but might occasionally make careless errors or get distracted.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level would likely have a strong grasp of the concepts and be less prone to simple errors.

## 5: Predict Percentages
Given the nature of the question and common errors:
- **Below Basic**: Might choose randomly or based on minimal understanding. \( A = 40\% \) (guessing or incorrect understanding of negatives), \( B = 30\% \) (simple mistake), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 20\% \).
- **Basic**: Would likely make a straightforward mistake. \( A = 60\% \) (correct or near), \( B = 30\% \) (forgetting negative times negative), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
- **Proficient**: Less likely to make simple errors. \( A = 90\% \) (understand and apply correctly), \( B = 8\% \) (occasional lapse), \( C = 1\% \), \( D = 1\% \).
- **Advanced**: Highly likely to answer correctly. \( A = 98\% \), \( B = 2\% \), \( C = 0\% \), \( D = 0\% \).

The best answer is below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=8% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
