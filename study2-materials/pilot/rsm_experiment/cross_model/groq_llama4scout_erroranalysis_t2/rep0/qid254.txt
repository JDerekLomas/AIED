To solve this, let's consider the common errors students might make and how they'd evaluate the expressions given:

## Step 1: Understand the Correct Calculation
The mean (average) is calculated by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the count of numbers. For the given numbers \(0, 1, 3, 4, 7\), the correct calculation for the mean is \(\frac{0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7}{5}\).

## 2: Identify Common Errors and Wrong Answers
- A: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) - This option misses the 0 in the summation.
- B: \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \) - This interprets the expression with incorrect order of operations, suggesting division by 5 only for the 7.
- C: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \) - This divides by the count of numbers excluding the zero, implying only non-zero values are considered or mistakenly only 4 numbers.

## 3: Analyze Option A
Option A misses the 0, leading students to potentially overlook the first number in a fast, superficial read. Stronger students are less likely to do this since they're more methodical.

## 4: Analyze Option B
Option B results from incorrect application of order of operations. It appeals to students who don't carefully follow rules about how to order calculations or assume division happens naturally after addition due to standard written form conventions.

## 5: Analyze Option C
Option C mistakes the denominator, not using the total count of numbers given (5) but assuming 4 perhaps due to habit in simpler questions or oversight.

## 6: Analyzing Attractiveness and Potential for Errors
- Most students can instantly spot D as potentially incorrect due to specific alternative responses provided; they'll usually check A, B, or C first.
- The more basic to intermediate students are more susceptible to syntax errors (Option B), mistakenly leaving out a step or assuming a logical addition means "add by the looks of them" (omitting 0) or reducing counting proficiency (miscount on choosing a denominator).

## 7: Allocation Across Bands
- Below Basic (rough estimations based on critical misunderstandings):
  - **Will readily choose A, misjudging to overlook zero.**
  - B: Order of operations can confuse leading them into B; 
  - D could appeal if frustrated by difficulty but understanding error; 
  - Therefore: \( A = 40\% \) For directly ignoring 0 in addition; 
    **$B > C $ in error likely to make** - \(  B = 35\% \), due to confusing ordering; thus
  - **thus \(\; C:=\;= 20\%\), under miscount and
   D=5% for admitting their A,C fail**   
- Basic: 
  - Have improved on awareness so not drawn**$ A\;->$ into same misconstruction  
  - More to $ D as not** fitting and * B more obviously wrong order operations) error.
   Basic more accurately identify errors to not be A =10 B=25,C15 so*  more methodical; more Aware then Basic. More *$; $\-method, more aware
-  Basic \( B(18) ,C(25),>10A\), B (under real ordering D=47);
     Proficient less ( error )** so aware 
- Proficient to less wrong on * A; ( B C*), and **strong more* on. C 4% and none them) - B * 5, A** method* (none of less). Advanced less fall into 
      For **so D 95** obviously then to right less* basic **than method and more thus aware**

Given these factors:
The best answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=35% C=20% D=5%
basic: A=10% B=25% C=15% D=50%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=4% D=89%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=0% D=99%
