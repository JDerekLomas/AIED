## Step 1: Understanding the question and the errors
The question requires solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) and evaluating the correctness of two proposed next steps: Tom's \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\) and Katie's \(x - 5 = 36\). To assess the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, we first need to understand the correct solution and the common errors.

## 2: Identifying the correct solution
The correct next step to solve \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) is to add 5 to both sides, yielding \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), which matches Tom's suggestion. This is a straightforward and correct algebraic manipulation.

## 3: Analyzing Tom's suggestion
Tom's suggestion, \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), is correct because adding 5 to both sides of the original equation results in \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5\), simplifying to \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\).

## 4: Analyzing Katie's suggestion
Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), is incorrect in the context of being a direct next step from \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\). To get \(x - 5 = 36\), one would multiply every term by 3 (resulting in \(x - 15 = 36\)), not directly from the given equation. The correct manipulation to match Katie's form would actually be multiplying both sides by 3: \(x - 15 = 36\), then adding 15 to both sides gives \(x = 51\), but Katie's line as presented (\(x - 5 = 36\)) doesn't directly follow from the original equation without multiplying by 3 first.

## 5: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not correctly solve the equation or understand the next steps. They could mistakenly choose D (Neither is correct) because they can't see how to get to either suggested line correctly, or they might think Katie's method could be right because it looks like a simple multiplication, leading to B (Only Katie) or D. Given the attractiveness of Katie's incorrect but seemingly logical step, there might be a higher percentage choosing B or D here.

- **Basic:** Basic students understand basic algebra and might see Tom's step as clearly correct. They might be confused by Katie's suggestion but could see it as potentially correct if they misunderstand the equation. They are likely to choose A (Only Tom) as they recognize Tom's step but might need more time to see Katie's error.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students can handle algebraic manipulations well and should easily recognize Tom's suggestion as correct. They might see Katie's suggestion as incorrect because it doesn't follow directly from adding 5 to both sides. However, some might struggle to articulate why Katie's isn't a valid step directly, making C (Both Tom and Katie) or A (Only Tom) plausible, with a higher percentage choosing A.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students would quickly recognize Tom's suggestion as correct and see that Katie's could potentially work but not directly as a next step. They should understand the algebra well enough to calculate \(x\) quickly and see both methods' validity or lack thereof. They are likely to choose A (Only Tom) since Tom's is the directly correct next step.

## 6: Estimating percentages
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (recognize Tom's correctness), B=20% (misunderstand Katie's step), C=10% (don't see either as correct), D=40% (can't understand either).
- **Basic:** A=60%, B=15%, C=10%, D=15%.
- **Proficient:** A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=90%, B=0%, C=5%, D=5%.

The best answer is below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
