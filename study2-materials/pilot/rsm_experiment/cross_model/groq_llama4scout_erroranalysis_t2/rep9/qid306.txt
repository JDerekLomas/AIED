## Step 1: Analyzing the structure of the problems
To solve these problems, we must understand the order of operations. For Problem P: \( 4-5+6= \), following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), we should perform the operations from left to right since there are no parentheses or exponents. Thus, the calculation should start with \( 4-5 \). For Problem Q: \( 4+5 \times 6= \), we must follow the order of operations which dictates that multiplication comes before addition, so \( 5 \times 6 \) should be calculated first.

## 2: Evaluating each option
- Option A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \). This option is partially correct for Problem P but incorrect for Problem Q because it suggests adding 4 and 5 first, rather than multiplying 5 and 6.
- Option B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \). This option is correct because for Problem P, it suggests starting with \( 4-5 \) and for Problem Q, it correctly identifies \( 5 \times 6 \) as the first calculation.
- Option C: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \). This option is incorrect for both problems because it suggests the wrong operations to perform first.
- Option D: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \). This option is incorrect for Problem P but correct for Problem Q.

## 3: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often lack understanding of the order of operations. They might choose options based on a superficial understanding or no understanding at all. Option C (\( 5+6 \) for P and \( 4+5 \) for Q) might seem appealing due to a lack of understanding, but actually, A and C might attract similar numbers because both represent a misunderstanding of the order of operations. Option B is the correct choice but might not be selected by many at this level.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors. They are more likely to recognize that multiplication comes before addition/subtraction but might get the sequence wrong. Option B should start to attract more attention here because it correctly identifies the operations for both problems.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand the order of operations well. They should predominantly choose Option B as it accurately reflects the correct sequence for both problems.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the order of operations but can also apply it correctly and efficiently. They would also choose Option B as the correct answer.

## 4: Estimating percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (easy to start with subtraction), B=20% (some understanding but might not apply correctly), C=30% (random or incorrect sequence), D=20% (addition/subtraction seems natural but incorrect for P).
- **Basic**: A=25%, B=50% (starting to understand the correct sequence), C=15%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=85% (clear understanding of order of operations), C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95% (solid grasp of the concept), C=0%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=50% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
