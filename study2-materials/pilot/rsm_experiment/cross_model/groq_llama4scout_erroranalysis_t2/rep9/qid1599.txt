To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the common errors students make in algebraic expressions.

The question asks for the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \). The correct answer is A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), as division by a quantity is represented as a fraction with that quantity in the denominator.

## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), is the correct representation of \( c \div(h+4) \). Students who are familiar with algebraic conventions and can correctly interpret the division as forming a fraction will choose this option.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \), might appeal to students who incorrectly add 4 to both the numerator and the denominator, possibly confusing the operation with adding fractions or incorrectly applying some unseen rule.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \), could result from students incorrectly interpreting the division and then adding 4, possibly due to a misunderstanding of the order of operations or the convention for combining terms.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( \frac{h+4}{c} \), seems to result from a straightforward inversion of the original expression, possibly suggesting that some students might see the division operation but incorrectly reciprocate both parts of the expression.

## 5: Attractive Errors and Student Understanding
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic notation. They could easily fall into traps like B, C, or D due to a fundamental lack of understanding of algebraic expressions. 
- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a basic understanding of algebra and might still make simple errors, such as choosing C due to misunderstanding the order of operations or B due to adding in both numerator and denominator mistakenly.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are likely to understand algebraic notation well but might still make careless mistakes. They may choose B or C due to inattention to detail or an incorrect calculation.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students should easily recognize the correct notation and would be less likely to choose incorrect options, although even they can make careless errors.

## 6: Estimation
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** Often struggle with even simple notation, so A would likely be chosen by few, let's say A=30%, B=20%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** Could understand the form but easily makes mistakes. A=60%, B=15%, C=20%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** Understands algebra well but can make careless errors. A=85%, B=5%, C=8%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** Highly likely to choose A. A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
