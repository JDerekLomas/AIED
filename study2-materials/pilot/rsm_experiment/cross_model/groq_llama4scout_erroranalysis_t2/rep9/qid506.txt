## Step 1: Understand the equation and the correct solution
The given equation is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\). To solve for \(p\), we divide both sides by 3, yielding \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\). Therefore, the correct answer is B) \(p = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 2: Identify common errors and attractive wrong methods
- Option A) \(p = \frac{1}{4}\) could result from \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) leading to \(p = \frac{1}{12} - 3\) or mistakenly multiplying \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3 instead of dividing, which doesn't directly lead to \(\frac{1}{4}\) but indicates a misunderstanding.
- Option C) \(p = 4\) might come from incorrectly multiplying \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3 to get 1 and then thinking \(p = 4\) satisfies \(3p = 1\), which isn't directly related but shows a miscalculation.
- Option D) \(p = \frac{1}{9}\) could stem from \(\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{12} - \frac{4}{12} = -\frac{3}{12}\) which was not a likely calculation but indicates confusion.

However, let's refocus on common algebraic mistakes:
- A common mistake is to divide \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3 incorrectly or not at all. For \(p = \frac{1}{4}\) (Option A), students might subtract 3 from \(\frac{1}{12}\) or directly get \(\frac{1}{4}\) from faulty divisions like \(\frac{1}{12} \times 3\).
- For \(p = 4\) (Option C), it seems to not directly derive through simple arithmetic mistakes.
- The transition to \(p = \frac{1}{36}\) (Option B) involves correctly dividing \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3.

## 3: Analyze likely student responses
- **Below Basic**: These students may not understand division of fractions or equality. They might pick \(p = \frac{1}{4}\) out of guesswork or directly trying simple operations. \(p = \frac{1}{4}\) could have an attraction due to basic addition or incorrectly multiplying.
- **Basic**: Students here know basic fractions and how to divide by a whole number. However, dividing \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3 to get \(\frac{1}{36}\) requires understanding fractions. Mistakes to A or C might occur due to oversight in operations.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to correctly calculate and might occasionally get confused, potentially choosing A if not careful with signs or steps.
- **Advanced**: Unlikely to make simple arithmetic errors on this question.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given the simplicity and difficulty:
- A attracts through simple errors or confusion (~20% below basic might choose A due to trial and error).
- B seems less directly error-prone without deep misconception.
- C seems unreasonable and thus harder to attract, implying low percentage error except in confusion.

Therefore, providing prediction based on common teaching pitfalls:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% B=10% C=40% D=20% 
- **Basic**: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
- **Advanced**: A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%

Let's transform the insights directly to the specified response format.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%
