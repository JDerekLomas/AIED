To approach this question, let's first analyze the steps given and identify any calculation errors that could lead to the wrong answers.

The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). 

## Step 1: Identify the correct steps
To solve the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \), we first multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which gives \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \). This simplifies to \( 60 = 1 + k \). 

## 2: Solve for \( k \)
Subtract 1 from both sides to solve for \( k \): \( 60 - 1 = k \), which simplifies to \( 59 = k \).

## 3: Evaluate Isaac's steps
Isaac's Step 1: \( 60 = 1 + k \) is correct based on our calculation.
Isaac's Step 2: \( 61 = k \) is incorrect because it incorrectly subtracts 1 from 60, yielding 61 instead of 59.

## 4: Analyze potential mistakes and student understanding
- **Only Step 1 correct (A):** The student understands the first step (multiplying by 4) but not the second. This could happen if the student doesn't complete the subtraction correctly or misunderstands the algebraic manipulation.
- **Only Step 2 correct (B):** This seems unlikely as Step 2 is based on a miscalculation.
- **Both steps correct (C):** Clearly incorrect since Step 2 yields an incorrect value for \( k \).
- **Both steps incorrect (D):** This could happen if a student misinterprets the equation entirely or makes a calculation error in Step 1.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra. They might incorrectly choose B if they blindly follow Isaac's steps without understanding the calculation, or they might choose D if they recognize both steps aren't fully correct but don't know why. A=10% (some understand multiplication), B=20% (follow incorrect step), C=5% (totally clueless), D=65%.
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a grasp of basic algebra but might make calculation errors. A=30% (understand first step), B=15% (miscalculation), C=5% (totally incorrect), D=50%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand algebra well but might still fall into traps. A=70% (see the correct first step), B=5% (unlikely to make this mistake), C=5% (know both are not correct), D=20%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to catch the mistake in Step 2. A=90% (clearly see Step 1 is correct and Step 2 is not), B=0% (unlikely to choose this), C=0% (both cannot be correct), D=10%.

## 6: Assign percentages
Based on typical student performance:
- **below_basic:** A=10%, B=20%, C=5%, D=65%
- **basic:** A=30%, B=15%, C=5%, D=50%
- **proficient:** A=70%, B=5%, C=5%, D=20%
- **advanced:** A=90%, B=0%, C=0%, D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=5% D=65%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=5% D=50%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
