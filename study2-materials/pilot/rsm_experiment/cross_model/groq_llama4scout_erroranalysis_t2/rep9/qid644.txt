To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential errors that could lead to each wrong answer.

The question asks for the product of \(-1\) and \(-4\), which is \(4\). Therefore, the correct answer is \(+4\) (Option A).

## Step 1: Identify the correct answer and common errors.
- The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).
- A common error could be forgetting that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result, leading to \(-4\) (Option B).
- Another potential error could involve incorrect application of rules or simple miscalculation, but given the simplicity of the question, such errors are less likely to produce options C or D directly.

## 2: Analyze potential errors for each wrong option.
- Option B (\(-4\)) could result from students forgetting the rule that two negatives make a positive, so they might calculate \(-1 \times -4 = -4\).
- Option C (\(+5\)) and Option D (\(-5\)) seem less directly related to common errors in this specific calculation since they involve adding or subtracting 1 from the correct product, which seems unlikely given the nature of the question.

## 3: Consider student ability levels and error likelihood.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the rules of multiplying negative numbers or might make basic arithmetic errors. They are more likely to choose B (\(-4\)) because they forget that two negatives make a positive.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic arithmetic but might still fall into traps. They are likely to choose A (\(+4\)) but might also choose B (\(-4\)) if they are uncertain about the signs.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the rules and are less likely to make simple arithmetic mistakes. They should predominantly choose A (\(+4\)).
- **Advanced**: These students are confident in their arithmetic and algebraic manipulations. They will almost certainly choose A (\(+4\)).

## 4: Estimate percentages based on error analysis.
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some understanding but might get it right), B=50% (common mistake), C=5%, D=5%.
- **Basic**: A=70%, B=25%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Proficient**: A=90%, B=8%, C=1%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

The best answer is A. 
below_basic: A=40% B=50% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=70% B=25% C=3% D=2%
proficient: A=90% B=8% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
