## Step 1: Understand the question and the possible errors
The question requires students to evaluate the expression \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). To solve this, students must follow the order of operations: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS or BIDMAS in the UK. The correct calculation is \(3 - 5 + 8 = 6\).

## 2: Identify common errors and their attraction
Common errors include:
- Not following the order of operations (BIDMAS/PEDMAS), which can lead to calculating from left to right incorrectly: \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 = 3 - 5 + 8\) is correct, but some might do \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 = 2\), and finally \(2 \times 2 = 4\).
- Miscalculating the multiplication: \(4 \times 2 = 6\) instead of \(8\), leading to \(3 - 5 + 6 = 4\).
- Incorrectly handling negative numbers or simple addition/subtraction.

## 3: Calculate specific percentages for each ability level
### For Below Basic:
Students at this level often struggle with basic arithmetic operations and the order of operations.
- Incorrectly solving from left to right without BIDMAS: \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 = (3 - 5) + 4 \times 2 = -2 + 8 = 6\). So, option A (6) might seem correct by chance for some.
- Multiplying wrongly or adding/subtracting: For example, getting \(4 \times 2 = 6\) (instead of 8) gives \(3 - 5 + 6 = 4\), which aligns with option B.
- Students might also get \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 = 2\), \(2 \times 2 = 4\), confusing the operation order.

Given these challenges, let's assume:
- A=30% (chance operations might incidentally yield correct),
- B=25% (common mistake due to incorrect multiplication or operation),
- C=15% (students getting a very wrong answer through operation reversal or other errors, such as \(-2 * 8 = -16\), then misadding),
- D=30% (students making severe operational mistakes).

### For Basic:
At this level, students have a basic grip on operations but might mess up on order of operations or simple calculations.
- A=40% (students understand order of operations somewhat),
- B=30% (error in multiplication or follow through after correct multiplication),
- C=20% (major errors, incorrect sign handling),
- D=10% (very lost, possible attempt to calculate but totally inaccurate).

### For Proficient:
These students are expected to apply the order of operations correctly and perform simple arithmetic accurately.
- A=80% (correct evaluation),
- B=10% (minor operational hiccup),
- C=5% (some conceptual issue or misplacement),
- D=5% (misdirection or total conceptual failure).

### For Advanced:
At this level, students should not only perform calculations accurately but understand how to approach and solve expressions confidently.
- A=95% (accurately evaluated),
- B=3% (minimal arithmetic oversights),
- C=1% (major issue with conceptual approach and misapplication),
- D=1% (error not due to conceptual misunderstandings).

## 4: Present in required format
Based on previous experience with mock exams and anticipating errors:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
