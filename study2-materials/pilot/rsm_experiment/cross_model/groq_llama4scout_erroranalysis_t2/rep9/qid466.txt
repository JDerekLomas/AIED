To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option for the question \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star=-1 \), let's analyze the potential errors and the attractiveness of each wrong answer.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Solution
The correct solution involves isolating \(\star\). To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by \(-\frac{3}{4}\), which is equivalent to multiplying both sides by the reciprocal \(\frac{-4}{3}\). So, \(\star = -1 \times \frac{-4}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\).

## 2: Analyzing Option A (\( \frac{4}{3} \))
This is the correct answer. Students who are proficient or advanced in maths should easily arrive at this solution.

## 3: Analyzing Option B (\( -\frac{4}{3} \))
This error could arise from mistakenly multiplying by \( \frac{4}{3} \) instead of \( -\frac{4}{3} \), or incorrectly handling the negative sign. It's an attractive error for students who struggle with signs.

## 4: Analyzing Option C (\( \frac{3}{4} \))
This might result from a student incorrectly solving the equation as \( \frac{3}{4} \times \star = 1 \) or similar misinterpretation, which could appeal to students with a basic understanding but lacking in applying operations correctly.

## 5: Analyzing Option D (\( -\frac{3}{4} \))
Choosing this option could indicate a student who simply substituted \( \star \) with a value they thought looked right or made a very basic calculation error, possibly related to misunderstanding how to solve for \( \star \) or mishandling negative numbers.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: These students often lack a foundational understanding. They might choose D (\( -\frac{3}{4} \)) as it directly relates to numbers given in the question, or C (\( \frac{3}{4} \)) due to a simplistic approach. A and B require more understanding of fractions and negative numbers.
- **Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with handling the negatives and fractions properly. They could be tempted by B (\( -\frac{4}{3} \)) due to sign errors or C (\( \frac{3}{4} \)) from confusion with the equation.
- **Proficient**: These students should mostly get it right, choosing A (\( \frac{4}{3} \)), but some might fall into the trap of B (\( -\frac{4}{3} \)) due to careless mistakes with signs.
- **Advanced**: These students should nearly all choose A (\( \frac{4}{3} \)), as the question is straightforward for them.

## 7: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some get it by chance or through rough estimates), B=15% (attractive due to incorrect handling of negatives), C=30% (simple, direct choice), D=35% (direct relation to the question).
- **Basic**: A=40% (more get it right but errors are common), B=25% (common error with signs), C=20% (less likely but still a trap), D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=80% (mostly get it right), B=15% (occasional careless mistake), C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: A=95%, B=4%, C=1%, D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
