## Step 1: Understanding the question and potential errors
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct method involves using the FOIL technique (First, Outer, Inner, Last) or expanding the brackets by multiplying each term. The correct answer is \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\), which corresponds to option B.

## 2: Identifying potential errors and attractive wrong methods
- Option A: \(m^2 - 2m - 35\). This could result from incorrectly applying the FOIL method or making a calculation error, such as \(-7m - 5m = -2m\) instead of \(-12m\).
- Option C: \(m^2 + 12m + 35\). This might come from adding the terms instead of subtracting, or incorrectly applying signs, such as \(-5 \times -7 = 35\) but \(m \times -7 + m \times -5 = -12m\) being incorrectly calculated as \(+12m\).
- Option D: \(m^2 - 12m - 35\). This could result from a sign error, such as \(-5 \times -7 = 35\) but then mistakenly subtracting \(35\) instead of adding it.

## 3: Analyzing errors by ability level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to make significant errors in applying the FOIL method or in basic arithmetic. They might not even attempt to use the correct method, leading to random or clearly incorrect choices. Option A seems like a plausible mistake here because it involves a simple arithmetic error (\(-7m - 5m = -2m\)), which might be attractive due to its simplicity.
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding but may struggle with applying the method consistently. They might easily fall into traps like adding instead of subtracting (leading to C) or misinterpreting the signs (leading to D). Option C could be attractive as it involves a common mistake of confusing the sign in front of the \(m\) term.
- **Proficient**: Students here have a good grasp of the method but might still make careless errors. They are less likely to choose A or C, as these involve more obvious mistakes. However, they might still opt for D if they confuse the constant term's sign.
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to get the question right (choosing B) but might consider the plausibility of other options based on common errors. They are less likely to fall into simple arithmetic traps.

## 4: Estimating percentages
Given the nature of the errors and typical student mistakes:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (simple error), B=20% (some understanding), C=20% (common mistake), D=20% (another sign error).
- **Basic**: A=25% (common simple mistake), B=40% (getting it right or close), C=20% (adding), D=15% (sign error).
- **Proficient**: A=10% (careless), B=80% (correct), C=5% (unlikely), D=5% (rare sign error).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (unlikely), B=90% (correct), C=2% (very unlikely), D=3% (extremely rare).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
