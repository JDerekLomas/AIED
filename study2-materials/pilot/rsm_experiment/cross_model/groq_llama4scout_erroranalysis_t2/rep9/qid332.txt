## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential errors
The question requires solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) and evaluating the correctness of two proposed next lines of working: \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \) by Tom and \( x - 5 = 36 \) by Katie.

## 2: Solve the equation to verify the correct next steps
To solve \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\), first add 5 to both sides: \(\frac{x}{3} = 12 + 5\), which simplifies to \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This confirms Tom is correct.

## 3: Evaluate Katie's proposal
Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\). To get this, she would have multiplied every term by 3: \( \frac{x}{3} \times 3 - 5 \times 3 = 12 \times 3 \), resulting in \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \). This indicates Katie's suggestion is incorrect based on the standard algebraic manipulation.

## 4: Identify calculation errors leading to wrong answers
- The error leading to choosing B (Only Katie) would involve not understanding how to isolate \(x\) properly or misinterpreting Katie's step.
- The error leading to choosing D (Neither is correct) would involve not recognizing Tom's correct step or incorrectly evaluating both steps.

## 5: Analyze attractiveness of wrong methods and student likely to fall into traps
- **Basic and below_basic levels**: Students at these levels might struggle with algebraic manipulations and could be attracted to Katie's method because it seems to simplify the equation by multiplying by 3, a common operation, but they might not execute it correctly.
- **Proficient and advanced levels**: Students at these levels should easily recognize Tom's correct manipulation. They might be less likely to fall for Katie's incorrect suggestion because they understand the algebraic principles.

## 6: Predict percentages based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: These students might not fully understand algebraic manipulations. They could mistakenly think Katie's method is correct or not recognize Tom's. A possible distribution could be A=40% (recognizes Tom), B=30% (thinks Katie's method looks right but don't execute it properly), C=10% (understand both), D=20% (don't understand either).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding. They are likely to recognize Tom's correctness but might be confused by Katie's. A possible distribution: A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students should clearly see Tom's step as correct and understand why Katie's is not. Distribution: A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: These students will easily identify Tom's correctness and Katie's error. Distribution: A=90%, B=0%, C=5%, D=5%.

## 7: Normalize to exact format requirement
Given the predicted behaviors:
- **below_basic**: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
- **basic**: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
