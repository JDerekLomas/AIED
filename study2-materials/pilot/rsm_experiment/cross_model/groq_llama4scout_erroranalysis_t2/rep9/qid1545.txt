## Step 1: Understand the question
The question requires students to compare the values of two expressions: \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\), and determine the correct symbol to place in the box between them.

## 2: Calculate the correct values of the expressions
First, calculate \(8+12 \div 4\):
- Following order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), we first do the division: \(12 \div 4 = 3\).
- Then, do the addition: \(8 + 3 = 11\).

Next, calculate \((8+12) \div 4\):
- First, do the operation inside the parentheses: \(8 + 12 = 20\).
- Then, do the division: \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 3: Compare the values and determine the correct symbol
Comparing the two results: \(11\) and \(5\), it's clear that \(11 > 5\). So, the correct symbol to place in the box is \(>\).

## 4: Analyze potential errors for each option
- Option A (\(>\)) is correct based on the calculations.
- Option B (\(<\)) would be chosen by students who incorrectly think \((8+12) \div 4 > 8+12 \div 4\).
- Option C (\(=\)) would be chosen by students who think the expressions are equal, possibly due to misunderstanding the order of operations or incorrectly simplifying the expressions.
- Option D (\(\geq\)) would be chosen by students who recognize \(11 > 5\) but mistakenly think there could be equality, or those who made a calculation error leading to equality.

## 5: Consider common calculation errors
A common error is not following the order of operations correctly. For \(8+12 \div 4\), some might calculate it as \(8 + 12 = 20\) then \(20 \div 4 = 5\), which would incorrectly make them think the expressions could be equal or lead to another wrong comparison.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often struggle with basic arithmetic and order of operations. They might incorrectly calculate both expressions or not calculate them at all, leading to random or intuitive guesses. Given their struggles, they might lean towards \(>\) (A) if they sense the first expression is larger without precise calculation, or \(C\) (=\()\) if they miscalculate or misunderstand. Option A=30%, B=20%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: These students have a better grasp of basic operations but might still struggle with more complex expressions. They might accurately calculate one expression but not the other, or misunderstand the operations, leading to a higher chance of selecting \(>\) (A) if they get the first expression right but misjudge the second. However, errors in calculation could lead them to \(C\) (=\()\). Option A=40%, B=25%, C=25%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students generally understand the order of operations and can calculate expressions accurately. However, they might still fall into traps if they're not careful. They are likely to choose \(>\) (A) if they correctly calculate both expressions. Option A=60%, B=15%, C=10%, D=15%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to accurately calculate both expressions and understand the comparison without issue. They would predominantly choose \(>\) (A). Option A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.

## 7: Provide the predicted percentages
Based on the analysis, the predicted percentages for each ability level are:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
