To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's first analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question is: \( 2 \frac{1}{5}+1 \frac{2}{5}= \) Leave your answer as a mixed number

## Step 1: Convert mixed numbers to improper fractions for easier calculation
To add these mixed numbers, it's helpful to convert them into improper fractions. \( 2 \frac{1}{5} = \frac{(2*5) + 1}{5} = \frac{10 + 1}{5} = \frac{11}{5} \) and \( 1 \frac{2}{5} = \frac{(1*5) + 2}{5} = \frac{5 + 2}{5} = \frac{7}{5} \).

## 2: Add the improper fractions
Adding these fractions: \( \frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{11 + 7}{5} = \frac{18}{5} \).

## 3: Convert the sum back to a mixed number
To convert \( \frac{18}{5} \) back to a mixed number: \( \frac{18}{5} = 3 \frac{3}{5} \) because \( 18 \div 5 = 3 \) remainder \( 3 \).

## 4: Analyze potential errors
- **Option B (\( \frac{18}{5} \))**: This is a correct calculation but not in the requested format (mixed number). Students who are familiar with fractions but forget the question asks for a mixed number might choose this.
- **Option C (\( \frac{18}{10} \))**: This could result from a student converting \( \frac{18}{5} \) to have a denominator of 10: \( \frac{18}{5} \times \frac{2}{2} = \frac{36}{10} \), which does not match, indicating a possible miscalculation or confusion with equivalent fractions.
- **Option D (\( 3 \frac{3}{10} \))**: This might come from a student incorrectly converting \( \frac{18}{5} \) to a mixed number, perhaps by dividing 18 by 10 instead of 5, or another form of calculation error.

## 5: Assess student ability levels and likely errors
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic conversions and additions. They could easily end up with **B**, **C**, or **D** due to a lack of understanding of mixed numbers and fractions.
- **Basic**: These students understand basic operations but might make careless errors. They could choose **B** for not converting back to a mixed number or **D** due to a calculation mistake.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students are likely to get it right (\( \frac{18}{5} \) or \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \)), but some might choose **B** if they forget to convert to a mixed number.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students should easily arrive at \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \) and are less likely to make errors.

## 6: Estimate percentages based on typical student performance
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (finally gets it right by chance or instinct), B=20% (some understanding of fractions), C=20% (confusion with fraction conversions), D=30% (misunderstanding of mixed numbers and fractions).
- **Basic**: A=60% (understands mixed numbers and fractions), B=20% (forgets to convert), C=5% (more aware of correct processes), D=15% (makes a calculation error).
- **Proficient**: A=90% (strong understanding), B=5% (minor oversight), C=0% (unlikely to make this error), D=5% (rare calculation mistake).
- **Advanced**: A=98% (expects a high level of accuracy), B=1% (unlikely oversight), C=0% (should recognize incorrect conversions), D=1% (extraordinarily rare error).

The best answer is A.
