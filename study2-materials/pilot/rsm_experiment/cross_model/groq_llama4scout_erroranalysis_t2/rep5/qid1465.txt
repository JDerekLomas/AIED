## Step 1: Understanding the Order of Operations
The expression given is \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication should be performed before addition and subtraction. So, the correct steps are: \(4 \times 2 = 8\), then \(3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6\).

## 2: Identifying Wrong Answers and Likely Errors
- Option A: \(6\) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \(4\) could result from \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\) then adding \(2\) (which is \(2 \times 1\), mistakenly using \(4 \times 1\)), or simply incorrect calculation: \(3 - 5 = -2\), \(-2 + 4 = 2\), \(2 \times 2 = 4\) (misinterpreting the order of operations).
- Option C: \(-12\) could result from miscalculating: \(4 \times 2 = 8\), \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 8 = 6\) (correct calculation) but mistakenly thinking \(-2 \times 6 = -12\) or simply adding/subtracting incorrectly from the start.
- Option D: \(-10\) seems to come from \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 = 2\), and \(2 \times 2 = 4\) doesn't lead to \(-10\); a likely error could be \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\) then multiplying by \(2\): \(2 \times 2 = 4\), or \(4 \times 2 = 8\) followed by subtracting \(18\): \(3 - 5 = -2\), \(-2 + (4 \times 2) = -2 + 8 = 6\), then mistakenly \(6 - 16 = -10\).

## 3: Analyzing Errors and Attractiveness to Students
- **Below Basic**: Students here are likely to not follow the order of operations properly. A common mistake could lead them to calculate from left to right without performing multiplication first: \(3 - 5 = -2\), \((-2) + 8\) correctly done yields \(6\), but easy errors happen e.g., \(3 - (5 + 8)\) misconstruing as \(-10\).
- **Basic**: Basic students understand the concept but may botch execution. For \(4 \times 2 = 8\), then \(3 - 5 + 8 = 6\). Mistakes could lead to calculations like \(3-5+4=2\) and "correctly" multiplying but then mis-adding \(2 \times 2\).
- **Proficient**: These students should manage to perform the operations: \(4 \times 2\), then add, subtract accordingly but small errors possible especially if under pressure e.g., \(-2\) for \(3-5\) then mis-calculating addition.
- **Advanced**: This group has solid grasp; errors unlikely due oversight possibly adding an extra element misplacing operation leading unlikely scores except in most marginal examples misapplication or recollection in instantaneity pressure stress during mocks could give aberrant lower outcomes A they hold more knowledge areas on general recall;  

## 4: Predicting Percentages Based on Mistake Likelihood
- **Option A = 6 (Correct):** Should rise as student proficiency does (\(80-90\% + likely\)).
- Common error **\(-2+8 or \( or simply \(-10 = (Mis-interpretation errors 20 or miscalculate)**


The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
