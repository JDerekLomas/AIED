To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the potential calculation errors and the attractiveness of each wrong method.

## Step 1: Understanding the Calculation for the Mean
The mean of a set of numbers is calculated by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the count of the numbers. For the given set \(0, 1, 3, 4, 7\), the correct calculation for the mean is \(\frac{0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7}{5}\).

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \(\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}\). This option incorrectly excludes the \(0\) from the sum, which is a common error if a student mistakenly thinks that zero does not contribute to the sum. This might be an "attractive" mistake for students who are not careful with the inclusion of all numbers.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \(0+1+3+4+7 \div 5\). This option incorrectly suggests dividing only the \(7\) by \(5\) and then adding the other numbers, which is a mistake related to the order of operations. However, some students might find this formulation appealing because it seems to follow a "add them all and then divide" logic but misinterprets how to apply the division.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \(\frac{1+3+4+7}{4}\). This option mistakenly divides by \(4\) (the count of non-zero numbers) instead of \(5\) (the total count of numbers), which could be an error for students who forget to include zero in the count of numbers.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D says "None of them," which would be correct if none of the provided calculations gives the correct answer.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding what constitutes a mean. They are more likely to choose an option that seems simplest or most appealing without fully understanding the calculation. Option B could be attractive here because it doesn't look obviously wrong to someone not understanding order of operations. A=10%, B=30%, C=20%, D=40%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might make careless mistakes. They might select A because it looks like a mean calculation but lacks the 0, or C because it simplifies the division. A=20%, B=25%, C=25%, D=30%.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the mean calculation but might still fall for attractive errors. Option A could be a trap for those who forget to add the 0. A=30%, B=10%, C=15%, D=45%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are less likely to make these errors, understanding both the necessity of including all numbers in the sum and the correct divisor. However, even they might occasionally choose A if they're in a hurry. A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.

## 7: Formalizing Predictions
Given these considerations, here are the formal predictions:
- below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=20% D=40%
- basic: A=20% B=25% C=25% D=30%
- proficient: A=30% B=10% C=15% D=45%
- advanced: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
