## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question asks to identify the correct algebraic convention for the expression \( c \div(h+4) \). The correct expression following algebraic conventions is \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which corresponds to option A.

## 2: Analyzing possible calculation errors for each wrong answer
- Option B, \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \), suggests adding 4 to \( c \) before dividing, which could result from misinterpreting the division as an operation to be performed after adding 4 to \( c \).
- Option C, \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \), implies dividing \( c \) by \( h \) and then adding 4, which could come from incorrectly applying order of operations or misreading the expression.
- Option D, \( \frac{h+4}{c} \), reverses the numerator and denominator, suggesting a misunderstanding of the division operation.

## 3: Identifying "attractive" errors
- Option B might seem attractive to students who are used to solving equations where constants are often added or subtracted from both sides, possibly leading them to mistakenly add 4 to \( c \).
- Option C could be attractive due to a common mistake of applying operations out of order or not properly understanding how to represent division by an expression algebraically.

## 4: Determining which students catch themselves vs. fall into traps
- Students with a basic understanding of algebra might fall into the trap of Option B if they are used to balancing equations.
- Students who are proficient might still make errors leading to Option C if they rush or misinterpret the algebraic notation.
- Advanced students are likely to catch themselves and avoid all incorrect options.

## 5: Predicting percentages
Given the typical errors and understanding of algebra:
- **Below Basic**: These students often lack a solid foundation. They are likely to choose any option that seems vaguely right. Option D might seem plausible due to confusion, while B and C represent common misunderstandings. A=40% (still some understanding of division), B=30% (adding inside the numerator is a common error), C=20% (thinking of Order of Operations in a wrong way), D=10% (simple reversal).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic grasp of algebra but might make simple errors. A=60% (many understand \( c \div (h+4) \) correctly), B=25% (misinterpreting division), C=10% (applying operations incorrectly), D=5% (less likely but still possible for confusion).
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebra and are less likely to make careless errors. A=90% (solid understanding), B=5% (minor misinterpretation), C=3% (unlikely but error in expression evaluation), D=2% (simple mistake with low probability).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a deep understanding of algebraic conventions. A=98% (highly confident in algebraic expression), B=1% (very unlikely mistake), C=0.5% (even less likely as they understand grouping), D=0.5% (highly unlikely).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
