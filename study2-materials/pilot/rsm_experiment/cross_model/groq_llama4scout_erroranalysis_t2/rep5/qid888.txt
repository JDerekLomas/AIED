## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\).

## 2: Correct Method
The correct method involves using the FOIL technique (First, Outer, Inner, Last) or the distributive property:
\[
(m-5)(m-7) = m(m) + m(-7) - 5(m) - 5(-7)
\]
\[
= m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35
\]
\[
= m^2 - 12m + 35
\]
So, the correct answer is B) \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 3: Analyzing Wrong Answers
- A) \(m^2 - 2m - 35\): This could result from incorrectly applying FOIL or distributive property, possibly mistakenly calculating \(-7m - 5m = -2m\).
- C) \(m^2 + 12m + 35\): This might come from adding the \(m\) terms instead of subtracting, \((-7m - 5m = +12m)\), which seems less likely but could happen due to careless error.
- D) \(m^2 - 12m - 35\): This could result from \(+35 - 7m \cdot -5 = -35\), incorrectly combining constants and \(m\) terms.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
## 4.1 Below Basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not apply FOIL correctly or make significant calculation errors.
- A: Likely high due to simple addition/subtraction errors, \(20\%\)
- B: Low because they might not execute the multiplication correctly, \(10\%\)
- C: Possible if they add instead of subtract the middle terms, \(15\%\)
- D: Possible for similar reasons, with errors in handling signs or terms, \(55\%\)

## 4.2 Basic
At this level, students understand basic algebra but may make careless mistakes.
- A: Moderate, due to calculation mistakes, \(25\%\)
- B: Higher, as they understand the method but might slip, \(60\%\)
- C: Could happen with incorrect signs, \(5\%\)
- D: Lower, but could occur with mistaken handling of constants, \(10\%\)

## 4.3 Proficient
Proficient students generally apply methods correctly but may have some errors.
- A: Lower, occasional miscalculation, \(5\%\)
- B: High, as they typically execute FOIL correctly, \(85\%\)
- C: Very low, understanding of signs and operations, \(2\%\)
- D: Low, similar to C, \(8\%\)

## 4.4 Advanced
Advanced students are expected to have a strong grasp of algebraic methods and minimize errors.
- A: Very low, rarely make such obvious errors, \(1\%\)
- B: Very high, consistently correct applications, \(95\%\)
- C: Extremely low, negligible, \(1\%\)
- D: Low, \(3\%\)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=15% D=55%
basic: A=25% B=60% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
