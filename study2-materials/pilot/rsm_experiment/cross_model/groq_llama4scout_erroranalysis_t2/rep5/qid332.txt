## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential errors.
The question requires students to evaluate two proposed next steps in solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\). Tom suggests \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), and Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\). We need to assess the correctness of each step and predict which students at different ability levels might choose each option.

## 2: Evaluate Tom's suggestion.
Tom's suggestion, \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), is a correct next step. To get this, one would add 5 to both sides of the original equation: \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5\), which simplifies to \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This is a standard algebraic manipulation.

## 3: Evaluate Katie's suggestion.
Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), is incorrect as a next step from the original equation. To get \(x - 5 = 36\), one would first multiply every term by 3 to clear the fraction: \(x - 15 = 36\), which does not match Katie's suggestion. The correct multiplication would result in \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\). Katie's error seems to be in multiplying by 3 and then not adjusting the constant term correctly.

## 4: Identify calculation errors leading to wrong answers.
- A common error for students to choose Katie's option might involve incorrectly multiplying the entire equation by 3 without properly adjusting each term, leading to confusion.
- The calculation error that leads directly to Katie's wrong answer involves not properly distributing the multiplication by 3 across all terms.

## 5: Assess which errors are attractive and who might catch themselves.
- Tom's answer is straightforward and correct, likely to be chosen by students who understand basic algebraic manipulations.
- Katie's answer might seem attractive to students who are not careful with algebraic manipulations, especially those who do not fully understand the need to multiply every term by 3 or add/subtract the same value to both sides.

## 6: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option.
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle with basic algebra. They might incorrectly choose Katie's option due to a misunderstanding of algebraic rules (A=20%, B=40%, C=10%, D=30%).
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to recognize Tom's correctness but might be tempted by Katie's if they're not fully attentive to details (A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%).
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebra and should easily see Tom's correctness and Katie's error. They are less likely to choose incorrect options (A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will clearly see both the correctness of Tom's suggestion and the flaw in Katie's. They are highly unlikely to choose incorrect options (A=90%, B=0%, C=10%, D=0%).

## 7: Transcribe the predictions into the required format.
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=10% D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=10% D=0%
