## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors
The question requires comparing two expressions: \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\). To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 2: Calculate the expressions correctly
First, calculate \(8+12 \div 4\):
- Division first: \(12 \div 4 = 3\)
- Then addition: \(8 + 3 = 11\)

Then, calculate \((8+12) \div 4\):
- Parentheses first: \(8 + 12 = 20\)
- Then division: \(20 \div 4 = 5\)

## 3: Compare the expressions
Comparing the two results: \(11\) and \(5\), it's clear that \(11 > 5\). So, the correct symbol to use is \(>\).

## 4: Analyze potential errors and student responses
- **Error leading to A (\(>\))**: This is the correct answer, chosen by students who correctly apply the order of operations.
- **Error leading to B (\(<\))**: Students might choose this if they incorrectly think \(5 < 11\) but made a calculation mistake leading them to believe the reverse. However, given the straightforward nature of the calculations, this seems less likely as a primary error.
- **Error leading to C (\(=\))**: This could happen if students mistakenly calculate both expressions as if they were equal or ignore the order of operations entirely (e.g., \(8 + 12 \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5\), or other similar mix-ups).
- **Error leading to D (\(\geq\))**: Similar to C, but acknowledging the possibility of equality. Students with a tendency to overestimate or include equality when it's not there might choose this.

## 5: Consider the common calculation mistakes
A common mistake would be to calculate \(8 + 12 \div 4\) as \((8 + 12) \div 4\) or to perform operations out of order. For \(8+12 \div 4\), some might incorrectly calculate it as \(20 \div 4 = 5\), leading to an incorrect equality or less than.

## 6: Assess student ability levels and error likelihood
- **Below Basic**: Likely to make significant calculation errors or ignore order of operations, possibly choosing C (\(=\)) as they might not fully understand the operations or their sequence.
- **Basic**: May struggle with order of operations, potentially leading to choosing C (\(=\)) if they mistakenly equate the expressions due to calculation errors.
- **Proficient**: Should mostly understand the order of operations but might still make slips. They are less likely to choose C (\(=\)) or D (\(\geq\)) and more likely to recognize \(>\) or \(<\).
- **Advanced**: Unlikely to make simple calculation errors; thus, they should predominantly choose A (\(>\)).

## 7: Estimate percentages based on ability levels
Given the nature of the question, let's assume:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some get it right by chance), B=20% (might see the numbers but calculate incorrectly), C=30% (equating expressions due to lack of understanding), D=10% (some include equality by mistake).
- **Basic**: A=60% (understand the basics), B=20% (some confusion), C=15% (make straightforward calculation errors), D=5% (overspecify).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (apply knowledge correctly), B=10% (occasional mistake), C=5% (rare misunderstanding), D=5% (sometimes cautious).
- **Advanced**: A=90% (almost always correct), B=5% (minor errors), C=3% (unusual mistakes), D=2% (exceptionally rare).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
