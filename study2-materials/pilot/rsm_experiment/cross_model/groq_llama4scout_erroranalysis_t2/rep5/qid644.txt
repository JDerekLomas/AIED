## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires the multiplication of two terms indicated by arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## 2: Identifying Wrong Answers and Calculation Errors
- Option A: \(+4\) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \(-4\) would result from \((-1) \times 4\) or \(1 \times (-4)\), not from \((-1) \times (-4)\).
- Option C: \(+5\) does not result from any simple multiplication of \(-1\) and \(-4\) or their positive counterparts.
- Option D: \(-5\) also does not result from the multiplication of \(-1\) and \(-4\).

## 3: Analyzing Errors
- The error leading to B: \(-4\) could come from mistakenly applying the rule for multiplying two negatives to get a negative, or simply misreading the numbers.
- Errors leading to C and D: \(+5\) and \(-5\) suggest a more significant misunderstanding or miscalculation, possibly adding instead of multiplying or using incorrect numbers.

## 4: Considering Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication, especially with negatives. They might choose B (\(-4\)) because it involves a simple subtraction or incorrect application of signs.
- **Basic**: At this level, students understand basic operations but might make careless mistakes. They could opt for B due to oversight in handling the negative signs.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the rules for multiplying negatives and positives. They are less likely to choose B, C, or D unless they make a careless mistake.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to get it right or be misled by less common misconceptions.

## 5: Predicting Percentages
Given the nature of the question:
- **Below Basic**: Likely to choose B (\(20\%\)) because it might seem like multiplying two negatives gives a negative, and A (\(60\%\)) if they somehow manage to guess correctly or recall the rule.
- **Basic**: Might choose B (\(15\%\)) due to simple mistakes, and mostly A (\(80\%\)) as they have a good grasp but might make small errors.
- **Proficient**: Expected to choose A (\(95\%\)), with a few possibly choosing B (\(5\%\)) due to careless errors.
- **Advanced**: Almost all will choose A (\(98\%\)), with very few errors.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
- The "attractive" wrong answer seems to be B for its simplicity and potential for sign errors.
- Correct answer A should be chosen by the majority, especially at higher levels.

The best answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
basic: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
proficient: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
