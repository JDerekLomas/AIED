## Step 1: Understanding the question and the errors
The question requires students to add two fractions: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \). To add these fractions, students need to find a common denominator, which in this case would be \( 2x \), resulting in \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \). 

## 2: Identifying common errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error would be to add the numerators and denominators separately without finding a common denominator, leading to \( \frac{3+4}{2x+x} = \frac{7}{3x} \) (Option B). This method feels natural but is incorrect.
- Another error could be adding the fractions by finding a common denominator but then incorrectly adding the numerators or leaving the denominator as \( x \) instead of \( 2x \), resulting in \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \) which is correct, but if students mistakenly don't multiply the second fraction correctly or forget to adjust, they might get \( \frac{7}{2x} \) (Option D) by wrongly assuming \( \frac{4}{x} = \frac{4}{2x} \) and then \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{2x} = \frac{7}{2x} \). However, the correct step would actually lead to the right answer directly.
- A simplistic or careless mistake could lead to \( \frac{3+4}{2x} = \frac{7}{2x} \) (Option D), assuming the denominators are the same or ignoring \( x \) in one of the fractions.
- Option C, \( \frac{11}{x} \), might come from incorrectly multiplying each fraction to get \( \frac{3x}{2x^2} + \frac{4x \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{3x + 8x}{2x^2} = \frac{11x}{2x^2} \) and then simplifying incorrectly.

## 3: Prediction by ability level
### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and fraction operations. They are likely to make straightforward errors:
- They might pick Option B (\( \frac{7}{3x} \)) because it represents an intuitive but incorrect addition of numerators and denominators.
- Option D (\( \frac{7}{2x} \)) could also be chosen due to simplistic adding without proper common denominator consideration.
- Correct answer A (\( \frac{11}{2x} \)) and thus others might be less frequently chosen.

### basic
At this level, students understand the concept of common denominators but might apply it loosely:
- They are less likely to choose B (\( \frac{7}{3x} \)) as they would recognize the error but might still falter.
- More would opt for A (\( \frac{11}{2x} \)) but with errors like Option D due to rushing or not fully applying the common denominator.

### proficient
Proficient students know how to add fractions properly and are less likely to make calculation errors related to finding a common denominator. They might still miscalculate if they rush:
- Few would choose B (\( \frac{7}{3x} \)) or C (\( \frac{11}{x} \)) as they are more careful.
- Most would get A (\( \frac{11}{2x} \)) right.

### advanced
Advanced students are highly likely to get it right as they would double-check their work and understand fraction operations thoroughly. However:
- Even they might occasionally misplace numbers or make a simple arithmetic mistake leading to incorrect options.

## 4: Quantitative Predictions
Given the errors and logic above:
- **below_basic**: A=20% (some actually get it right by chance), B=40%, C=10%, D=30%.
- **basic**: A=50%, B=30%, C=5%, D=15%.
- **proficient**: A=80%, B=10%, C=2%, D=8%.
- **advanced**: A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
