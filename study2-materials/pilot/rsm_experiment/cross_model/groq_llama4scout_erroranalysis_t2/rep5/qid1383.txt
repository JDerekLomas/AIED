## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to substitute \( k = -3 \) into the equation \( T = k^4 \) and solve for \( T \). The correct calculation is \( T = (-3)^4 = 81 \).

## 2: Identifying Common Errors
- Option B (12) could result from a calculation error where the student mistakenly calculates \( (-3)^4 \) as \( -3 \times 4 = -12 \) or incorrectly applies the exponent as \( 3^4 = 81 \) but then mistakenly thinks \( (-3)^4 = -81 / -3 = -27 \) or simply does \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \), showing a lack of understanding of exponent rules.
- Option C (-81) might come from students who understand the exponent but forget that an even power of a negative number is positive, calculating \( (-3)^4 \) as \( -(3^4) \).
- Option D (-12) seems less likely but could come from a miscalculation similar to those leading to B, with an additional mistake in handling negative numbers.

## 3: Analyzing Calculation Errors
- The error leading to B (12) seems unlikely directly but could stem from confusion with \( 3 \times 4 \). It's more likely students confuse the operation or misapply rules.
- The error leading to C (-81) is more straightforward, indicating a student remembers to raise 3 to the power of 4 but forgets that raising a negative number to an even power results in a positive number.
- D (-12) doesn't directly follow from common mistakes with this kind of problem.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: These students often struggle with basic arithmetic and algebraic concepts. They might incorrectly calculate or simply guess. Option C (-81) seems attractive because it follows from calculating \( 3^4 = 81 \) and then incorrectly applying the negative sign. Option B (12) and D (-12) might be chosen due to confusion or basic arithmetic errors. A (81) would be correct but less likely if students can't handle negative exponents properly.
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic algebra but might struggle with nuances. They are likely to mistakenly calculate \( (-3)^4 \) as \( -(3)^4 = -81 \) (Option C), showing understanding of \( k^4 \) but not the impact of the negative sign being raised to an even power.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to correctly calculate \( (-3)^4 = 81 \), thus choosing A (81). Mistakes into B or D seem less likely as they'd understand the exponent rules better.
- **Advanced**: These students not only calculate correctly but also understand why. They're unlikely to choose incorrect options unless in a careless mistake.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (basic recall might get it right, or very simple guesses), B=20% (simple, but likely they get B from no method or simple multiplication mistakes), C=30% (easily mistaken due to missing the positivity from even exponent), D=10% (direct guesses or simple addition/subtraction errors).
- **Basic**: A=60% (getting the power of 4 right), B=15% (thinking linear or not applying exponent correctly), C=20% (even power/negative error), D=5% (rare errors, usually guessing).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (understand and apply rules), B=5% (confusion with lower arithmetic operations), C=10% (lapse into simple linear errors), D=5% (either guessing wildly or errors unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (confidence with rules), B=2% (highly unlikely direct mistake), C=2% (almost certainly not choosing incorrectly due to thorough understanding), D=1% (extremely rare mistake).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
