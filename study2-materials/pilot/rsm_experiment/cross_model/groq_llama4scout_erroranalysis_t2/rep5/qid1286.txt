## Step 1: Understand the problem and the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere. To find the radius \(r\) in terms of \(V\), we rearrange this formula: \(r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\), and therefore \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\).

## 2: Identify the correct answer
From the rearranged formula, the correct answer is \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\), which corresponds to option C.

## 3: Analyze potential calculation errors for each wrong answer
- Option A: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \) suggests a mistake where the \(\pi\) is incorrectly included in the numerator and the fraction is inverted.
- Option B: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \) implies that the student forgot to include \(\pi\) in the denominator or incorrectly rearranged the formula.
- Option D: \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \) suggests a significant misunderstanding, possibly deriving from incorrectly taking the cube root of the entire equation without properly isolating \(r\).

## 4: Consider which errors are "attractive" and which students might fall into these traps
- Students who are not confident with rearranging formulas might struggle with isolating \(r\), making option B a plausible mistake for basic and below_basic levels.
- Students who misunderstand how to handle \(\pi\) in the volume formula might choose option A.
- Option D seems less likely as it represents a more fundamental misunderstanding of solving for \(r\).

## 5: Estimate the percentage of students at each ability level choosing each option
Given the nature of the mistakes:
- **Below_basic**: These students are likely to make significant errors. Option B seems a natural trap (\( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \)) as it reflects a common mistake of not properly using \(\pi\) in the calculation. Option A (\( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \)) could also be appealing due to its seeming mathematical validity but incorrect application. Below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundation but may still struggle with algebraic manipulation. They are more likely to correctly identify the formula but mix up components. Basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
- **Proficient**: These students understand the formulas and can manipulate them but might still make minor errors under pressure. They are less likely to choose obviously incorrect options. Proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are confident and accurate in their algebraic manipulations. They are most likely to choose the correct answer and least likely to fall into traps. Advanced: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
