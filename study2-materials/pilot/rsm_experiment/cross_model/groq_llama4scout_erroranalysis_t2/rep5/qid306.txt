To approach this question, let's analyze the problems and the common mistakes students might make.

Problem P: \( 4-5+6= \)

- The correct order of operations here is to perform the operations from left to right since they are all addition and subtraction: \( 4 - 5 + 6 \). So, first, \( 4 - 5 \).

Problem Q: \( 4+5 \times 6= \)

- Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BIDMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), the multiplication should be done first: \( 5 \times 6 \), then add \( 4 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Operations
For Problem P, students should start with \( 4 - 5 \) because operations are performed from left to right. For Problem Q, students should start with \( 5 \times 6 \) because multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations.

## 2: Identifying Potential Errors
- A common error in Problem P would be starting with \( 5 + 6 \) if students mistakenly think that addition should precede subtraction when both are present without parentheses.
- For Problem Q, a frequent mistake is to start with \( 4 + 5 \), ignoring the multiplication.

## 3: Anticipating Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand the order of operations at all. They might randomly select operations or follow an incorrect sequence they find "comfortable."
- **Basic**: Basic level students might have a basic grasp of addition and subtraction but could struggle with the order of operations, especially with multiplication and addition/subtraction mixed.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students generally understand the order of operations but can make careless mistakes under pressure.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to get it right but might second-guess themselves.

## 4: Predicting Percentages
- **Below Basic (Struggling Students)**: These students might choose \( C \) or \( A \) randomly, but \( C \) (Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \)) seems attractive because it doesn't require understanding the order of operations. \( A \) (Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \)) might also appeal as it's a straightforward but incorrect approach for Q. Let's guess \( A=20\% \), \( B=10\% \), \( C=40\% \), \( D=30\% \).
- **Basic**: Basic students might understand simple operations but could confuse the sequence. Option \( B \) (Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \)) is actually correct, so fewer will choose incorrect options. Guess \( A=10\% \), \( B=60\% \), \( C=20\% \), \( D=10\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to know the correct sequence. The correct answer is \( B \), so let's assume \( A=5\% \), \( B=80\% \), \( C=10\% \), \( D=5\% \).
- **Advanced**: Even fewer errors here. Let's assume \( A=0\% \), \( B=90\% \), \( C=5\% \), \( D=5\% \).

The best answer is B. 

Given my analysis and without actual calculation and in line with typical student errors, 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
