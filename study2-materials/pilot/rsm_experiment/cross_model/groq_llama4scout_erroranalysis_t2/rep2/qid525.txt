## Step1: Understanding the Question
The question requires adding two mixed numbers: \(2 \frac{7}{10} + 2 \frac{1}{4}\). To solve this, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, add them, and then add the whole numbers.

## 2: Common Denominator and Calculation
The common denominator for 10 and 4 is 20. Convert both fractions: \(2 \frac{7}{10} = 2 \frac{7 \times 2}{10 \times 2} = 2 \frac{14}{20}\) and \(2 \frac{1}{4} = 2 \frac{1 \times 5}{4 \times 5} = 2 \frac{5}{20}\). Then, add them: \(2 \frac{14}{20} + 2 \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}\).

## 3: Analyzing Wrong Answers
- A: \( \frac{99}{20} \) seems to be the result of adding the fractions and whole numbers incorrectly or not converting to a mixed number properly. It could result from \(2.7 + 2.25 = 4.95\), then converting 4.95 to a fraction or mixed number.
- B: \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \) is the correct answer.
- C: \( \frac{99}{40} \) could result from adding the fractions \( \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} \) to get \( \frac{28}{40} + \frac{10}{40} = \frac{38}{40} \), then adding 4 (from \(2 + 2\)) to get \( 4 \frac{38}{40} = \frac{160}{40} + \frac{38}{40} = \frac{198}{40} \) and simplifying or mistakenly calculating.
- D: \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \) might come from finding a common denominator (70) and getting \( \frac{49}{70} + \frac{17.5}{70} \) or similar incorrect steps.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with finding a common denominator or adding fractions. They might opt for A or C due to simplistic addition or incorrect conversion.
- **Basic**: Students here understand fractions but might mix methods. They could choose A if they incorrectly add decimals or C if they mistakenly calculate with a wrong common denominator.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the process but might make careless mistakes. They are less likely to choose A or C, as they grasp the concept of common denominators.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are likely to get it right, choosing B.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% ( straightforward but wrong calculation), B=10% (got it right by chance), C=30% (misunderstanding of fractions), D=20% (incorrect common denominator).
- **Basic**: A=20% (simple mistakes), B=50% (understand the concept but might make minor errors), C=20% ( common denominator but adds wrong), D=10% (some understanding but applies it wrongly).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (careless mistake), B=80% (confident in method), C=10% (occasional slip), D=5% (misapplication of concept).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (unlikely to make simple mistakes), B=90% (correct application), C=5% (very occasional mistake), D=5% ( unlikely but could happen with a very silly error).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
