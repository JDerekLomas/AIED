## Step 1: Understand the question and the common mistakes
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct answer can be found using the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last), which yields \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\). 

## 2: Identify common errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error is to add the constants and multiply the \(m\) terms: \((m \cdot m) + (-5 \cdot -7) = m^2 + 35\), and then incorrectly combine the \(m\) and constant terms, but actually, a straightforward mistake would be not applying FOIL correctly.
- For option A (\(m^{2}-2 m-35\)), the calculation error could be \(m \cdot m - 7m - 5m - 5 \cdot 7\), but this doesn't directly align with a simple mistake. A likely mistake leading to A is \(-7m - 5m = -12m\) but incorrectly handling the constants or signs.
- For option B (\(m^{2}-12 m+35\)), this is the correct answer, so we expect a high percentage of proficient and advanced students to choose this.
- For option C (\(m^{2}+12 m+35\)), a mistake could be adding the \(m\) terms instead of subtracting: \(m^2 - 7m + 5m + 35 = m^2 - 2m + 35\), but actually getting \(+12m\) suggests a sign error.
- For option D (\(m^{2}-12 m-35\)), the error here could be adding \(-5 \cdot -7 = +35\) but confusing the sign in front of the 35.

## 3: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option
- **Below Basic**: These students struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They are more likely to make simple arithmetic errors. Option A could appeal due to confusion with signs or operations. Option D might seem plausible due to incorrect handling of signs. 
  - Below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%

- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic concepts but may struggle with more complex manipulations or checking their work. They might easily fall into traps like adding instead of multiplying or misinterpreting signs. 
  - Basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%

- **Proficient**: These students have a good grasp of algebraic techniques and can apply them accurately. However, under pressure, they might rush and make careless errors. 
  - Proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%

- **Advanced**: This group consists of students who not only understand but can also apply and sometimes extend algebraic concepts. Errors are less common but might occur due to overconfidence or rushing.
  - Advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
