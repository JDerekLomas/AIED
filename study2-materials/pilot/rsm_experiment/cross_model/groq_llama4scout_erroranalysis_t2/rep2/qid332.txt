## Step 1: Understanding the question and the potential errors
The question requires students to evaluate two proposed next steps in solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\). Tom suggests \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), and Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\). To assess who is correct, we need to understand the algebraic manipulations involved.

## 2: Evaluating Tom's suggestion
Tom's suggestion, \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), is obtained by adding 5 to both sides of the original equation: \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5\), which simplifies to \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This is a correct algebraic manipulation.

## 3: Evaluating Katie's suggestion
Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), seems to be derived by multiplying every term in the original equation by 3: \(3 \cdot \frac{x}{3} - 3 \cdot 5 = 3 \cdot 12\), resulting in \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\). This indicates Katie's suggestion is incorrect as presented.

## 4: Identifying potential errors and student misconceptions
- Students might choose A (Only Tom) if they correctly validate Tom's step but fail to see the mistake in Katie's or misinterpret Katie's step.
- Students might choose B (Only Katie) if they incorrectly validate Katie's step or fail to see Tom's correct step.
- Students might choose C (Both Tom and Katie) if they incorrectly validate both steps or misunderstand algebraic manipulations.
- Students might choose D (Neither is correct) if they correctly identify that Katie's step is wrong but also incorrectly dismiss Tom's step.

## 5: Analyzing the errors
- A common error for "below basic" students might be not understanding how to isolate \(x\) or misunderstanding the equation, potentially leading them to choose B or D without realizing Tom's correct manipulation.
- "Basic" level students might see Tom's step as correct but struggle with Katie's, possibly choosing A because they recognize Tom's validity but not Katie's error properly.
- "Proficient" students would likely recognize Tom's step as correct and Katie's as incorrect, leading them to choose A.
- "Advanced" students would not only recognize both steps' validity or lack thereof but also understand why Katie's suggestion doesn't match her proposed step, likely choosing A.

## 6: Predicting the percentages
Given the algebraic nature and common mistakes:
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle to understand the algebraic manipulations. They might find Katie's step attractive because it seems to involve a simple multiplication, which they might incorrectly validate, leading to B=30%, A=20%, D=30%, C=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here would likely understand Tom's step but might be confused by Katie's. They might lean towards A=50%, B=20%, D=20%, C=10%.
- **Proficient**: With a good understanding of algebra, they would see Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect, suggesting A=70%, B=10%, D=15%, C=5%.
- **Advanced**: These students would easily see Tom's step as correct and immediately recognize Katie's error, likely resulting in A=90%, B=5%, D=5%, C=0%.

## 7: Finalizing predictions
Based on the experience and analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=50% B=20% C=10% D=20%
- proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
- advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
