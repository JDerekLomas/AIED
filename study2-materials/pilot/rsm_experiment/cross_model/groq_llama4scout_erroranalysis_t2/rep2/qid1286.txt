## Step 1: Understand the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

## 2: Rearrange the formula to solve for \(r\)
To find the radius \(r\), we rearrange the formula:
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
\[V \cdot \frac{3}{4\pi} = r^3\]
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]

## 3: Identify the correct answer
From the rearranged formula, the correct answer is:
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]
This matches option C.

## 4: Analyze each incorrect option for common errors
- Option A: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V\pi}{3}}\). This would result from incorrectly rearranging the formula, possibly mistakenly multiplying by \(\pi\) instead of dividing.
- Option B: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}\). This error might come from forgetting to multiply by \(\pi\) in the denominator or incorrectly handling the \(\pi\) term.
- Option D: \(\frac{3\sqrt[3]{V}}{4\pi}\). This seems to result from a incorrect handling of the cubic root and the constants, possibly applying the cubic root to \(V\) but not properly adjusting the rest of the formula.

## 5: Consider the likelihood of each error by ability level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with rearranging formulas and could easily fall into traps by misinterpreting the formula. They might choose option A because it looks plausible and involves a direct manipulation of the given terms without properly solving for \(r\).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebraic manipulations but might still make careless errors. They could choose option B if they misunderstand how to isolate \(r\), possibly due to a mistake in handling \(\pi\).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the formula and can rearrange it but might still make minor errors under pressure. They are less likely to choose A or B but might be tempted by D if they incorrectly apply algebraic rules.
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to correctly solve for \(r\) and choose option C, as they have a strong understanding of algebraic manipulations and the formula for the volume of a sphere.

## 6: Predict percentages based on error analysis
Given the errors and the understanding that:
- Option C is the correct answer,
- Option A involves a mistake that could seem logical,
- Option B involves another plausible mistake,
- Option D seems less straightforward and more algebraically incorrect,

## 7: Assign predicted percentages
- **Below Basic**: Might have high rates of A and B due to lack of understanding of algebraic manipulation. A=30%, B=25%, C=20%, D=25%.
- **Basic**: Should start to show understanding but might still fall for common traps. A=20%, B=20%, C=40%, D=20%.
- **Proficient**: Understand the concept but might make critical errors. A=10%, B=10%, C=70%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: Should almost universally choose C. A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
