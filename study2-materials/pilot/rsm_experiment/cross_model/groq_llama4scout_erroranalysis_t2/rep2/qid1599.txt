To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the potential calculation errors and the attractiveness of each wrong answer.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Answer
The correct calculation using algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \) is \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which corresponds to option A. This is because division by a quantity is equivalent to multiplication by its reciprocal, and the correct representation maintains \( c \) as the numerator and \( h+4 \) as the denominator.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \), suggests an error where the student incorrectly adds 4 to \( c \), possibly confusing the operation with adding a fraction with a common denominator or misinterpreting the division as an opportunity to perform an addition within the fraction. For below_basic students, this might seem like a legitimate way to "distribute" or adjust the expression. More proficient students are less likely to make this mistake.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \), implies that the student mistakenly separated the division into two parts: dividing \( c \) by \( h \) and then adding 4. This error might arise from not properly handling the order of operations or misapplying rules of fractions. Students at the basic and below_basic levels might find this attractive because it breaks down the operation into more manageable but incorrect parts.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( \frac{h+4}{c} \), suggests that the student inverted the division, likely due to a fundamental misunderstanding of division or its relationship to fractions. This could be a common mistake among students who are still developing their understanding of algebraic expressions and operations.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: These students often lack a solid foundation in algebraic expressions. They might find option B attractive because it looks like a transformation of the original expression (\( c \) and \( h+4 \) both seem to be modified in a similar way). Option C could also seem reasonable because it provides a clear two-step process that might appear logical. Option D might appeal due to simple inversion. Option A would likely be chosen by a low percentage because it requires a correct understanding of division by a quantity. Predicted percentages: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have some understanding but are prone to simple errors. They might still fall for option B or C due to a misunderstanding of how to apply operations. Option A should start to look more attractive as these students begin to grasp algebraic conventions. D might appeal less as they become more familiar with the syntax. Predicted percentages: A=50% B=25% C=20% D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students generally understand algebraic conventions well. They are less likely to choose B, C, or D. Option A is clearly correct, and most should identify it as such. Predicted percentages: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand algebraic conventions but are also less prone to simple calculation mistakes. They should almost universally choose option A. Predicted percentages: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
