To approach this question, let's first analyze the options and the specific calculation errors that lead to each wrong answer.

The correct calculation for the mean is \( \frac{0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7}{5} \).

## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). The error here is omitting the 0 from the sum, which is a straightforward mistake but not necessarily an error in method. It's about remembering to include all values.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \). This option incorrectly implies division by 5 should only apply to the 7, due to incorrect application of order of operations. This can be an attractive mistake because it seems to follow a "add them all up and then divide by the number of items" approach but executes it wrongly by not using brackets.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \). The mistake here involves both omitting the 0 from the sum (like in Option A) and also incorrectly counting the number of values as 4 instead of 5.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D states "None of them", which would be correct if all other options are incorrect.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often struggle with basic arithmetic operations and may not fully understand the concept of mean. They might find Option B attractive because it seems to involve adding all numbers and then doing something with 5, but the execution is wrong. Option A might seem right but without the 0, it's incomplete. Option C could appeal due to simplicity. 
- **Basic**: Basic level students understand the concept of mean but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to spot Option B as incorrect due to order of operations errors but might fall for Option A if they forget the 0. Option C seems incorrect because it uses the wrong number of values.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students are more likely to catch errors in calculation. They should recognize Option B as incorrect due to the order of operations. Option A might be tempting if they mistakenly omit the 0. Option C is seen as incorrect because it's missing both the 0 and uses an incorrect count of numbers.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to identify the correct formula quickly. They might note the omission in Option A and incorrectly suggest it's thus not an option. They should quickly dismiss B and C as incorrect due to methodological errors.

## 6: Percentage Predictions
Given the above analysis, here are the predicted percentages:

- **Below Basic**: A=30% (omits 0 but process seems correct), B=40% (seems to involve steps to find mean but executed wrongly), C=20% (simple mistake), D=10% (may not consider if other options seem viable).
- **Basic**: A=40% (common mistake to omit 0), B=25% (recognize some error but confusing), C=15% (basic understanding), D=20% (more capable of spotting errors across options).
- **Proficient**: A=20% (know what to do but might forget 0), B=10% (order of operations understood), C=5% (clear methodological error), D=65% (most recognize inaccuracies).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (strong understanding, highly unlikely to miss 0), B=5% (clearly understand operational order), C=0% (recognize both issues), D=90% (very confident in identifying all errors).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
