To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential errors that could lead to each wrong answer.

The question asks students to multiply the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## Step 1: Identify the correct answer
The correct answer is \(+4\), which corresponds to option A.

## 2: Analyze potential errors for each wrong option
- Option B: \(-4\). This would be the result of mistakenly thinking the product of two negatives is negative, which is a fundamental error but not as common as simple sign errors in more complex calculations.
- Option C: \(+5\). This could result from a calculation error where a student mistakenly adds or uses incorrect numbers.
- Option D: \(-5\). Similar to option B, this suggests a misunderstanding of the multiplication of negatives.

## 3: Consider "attractive" errors
- The error leading to \(-4\) (B) is less attractive because it actually requires understanding that multiplying two negatives gives a positive, but then incorrectly applying a negative sign.
- The error leading to \(+5\) (C) or \(-5\) (D) seems less straightforward and might come from more general calculation mistakes or guessing.

## 4: Evaluate student ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication, especially with negative numbers. They might choose B or D due to a lack of understanding of negative number multiplication.
- **Basic**: Students here understand basic operations but might make careless mistakes. They could opt for B if they forget the rule about multiplying negatives.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the rules but might still fall into traps if they're not fully engaged or if the question is read hastily. They are less likely to choose B or D.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are less likely to make simple errors and will likely choose A.

## 5: Estimate percentages based on error analysis
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below_basic**: A=40% (simple correct calculation might not be common), B=30% ( mistake in negative multiplication), C=10%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: A=70%, B=20% (common mistake), C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=90%, B=5%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

The best answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
