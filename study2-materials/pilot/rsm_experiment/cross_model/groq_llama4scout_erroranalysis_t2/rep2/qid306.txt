## Step 1: Understanding the Problems and Operations
First, let's understand the two problems and the order of operations required for each. Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \) and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). For Problem P, the operations are addition and subtraction, which are performed from left to right. For Problem Q, the operation \( 5 \times 6 \) should be performed first because multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations.

## 2: Identifying Correct Calculations
For Problem P, the correct order is to perform the operations from left to right: \( 4-5 = -1 \), then \( -1 + 6 = 5 \). So, the first calculation should indeed be \( 4-5 \).

For Problem Q, following the order of operations, \( 5 \times 6 \) should be calculated first, which equals \( 30 \), then \( 4 + 30 = 34 \). So, the correct first calculation is \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
Given the correct calculations:
- Problem P should start with \( 4-5 \).
- Problem Q should start with \( 5 \times 6 \).

Let's analyze the options:
A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - Incorrect for Q.
B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Correct.
C: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - Incorrect for both.
D: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Incorrect for P.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand the order of operations well and could randomly select or follow an incorrect, attractive option. Option C seems plausible because it suggests adding or multiplying without considering the correct order, which might appeal to those not understanding the rules.
- **Basic**: Basic level students might have a grasp of simple operations but could struggle with applying the order of operations correctly, especially in more complex expressions. They might lean towards option B if they've been taught the basics of order of operations, but could also be swayed by simpler or more direct calculations.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students should understand and apply the order of operations correctly. They would likely choose option B as it correctly identifies the first steps for both problems.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students would certainly choose option B, confidently applying their knowledge of mathematical operations and their order.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the above analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=10% (some understanding but prone to error), B=20% (some grasp of basics), C=40% (simplistic or wrong approach), D=30% (random or incorrect logic).
- **Basic**: A=5% (basic understanding but error-prone), B=60% ( grasp of order of operations), C=20% (partial understanding), D=15% (confusion).
- **Proficient**: A=0% (understand order of operations), B=90% (correct application), C=5% (rare mistake), D=5% (occasional confusion).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95%, C=0%, D=5%.

## 6: Finalizing Estimates
Based on typical student performance and understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=5%, B=15%, C=60%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: A=5%, B=70%, C=15%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=0%, B=95%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=98%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=5% B=15% C=60% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=70% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
