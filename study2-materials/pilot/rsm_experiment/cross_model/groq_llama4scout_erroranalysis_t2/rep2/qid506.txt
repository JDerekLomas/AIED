## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential errors
The question requires solving the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) for \(p\). To solve it correctly, one must divide both sides by 3, yielding \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

## 2: Identify potential errors and attractive wrong methods
- Option A (\(p = \frac{1}{4}\)) might result from incorrectly multiplying \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3 instead of dividing, which seems like an unlikely direct mistake but could happen if a student is confused about the operations.
- Option B (\(p = \frac{1}{36}\)) is the correct answer, resulting from \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{36}\).
- Option C (\(p = 4\)) could result from a calculation error where \(\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = 4\), likely due to incorrect handling of fractions or a miscalculation.
- Option D (\(p = \frac{1}{9}\)) might seem plausible if a student incorrectly simplifies or calculates \(\frac{1}{12} \div 3\), possibly thinking of it as \(\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{3}{1} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}\) or getting confused with proportions.

## 3: Analyze the error for each option
- The error leading to A (\(p = \frac{1}{4}\)) could be a straightforward mistake where a student does \(3 \times \frac{1}{12}\) instead of \(\frac{1}{12} \div 3\), which doesn't directly seem attractive but indicates a clear misunderstanding.
- The correct calculation yields B (\(p = \frac{1}{36}\)), which should be chosen by students with a solid grasp of fraction division.
- Option C (\(p = 4\)) seems highly unlikely as it would require \(\frac{1}{12} = 3 \times 4 = 12\), indicating a significant miscalculation.
- Option D (\(p = \frac{1}{9}\)) doesn't directly derive from a simple operation mistake related to the given equation, suggesting it might not be a common error.

## 4: Consider student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic operations and fraction handling. They might be attracted to simpler or more direct calculations and could easily fall into traps like multiplying instead of dividing or misinterpreting fractions.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with more nuanced operations like dividing by a whole number or handling fractions properly.
- **Proficient**: These students should have a good grasp of basic math operations, including handling fractions and solving simple equations. They are less likely to fall into basic traps.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are likely to solve the equation correctly but might also be the ones to recognize common pitfalls.

## 5: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option by ability level
- **Below Basic**: These students might commonly choose A or C due to straightforward calculation errors. A=30% (simple multiplication error), B=10% (correct but unlikely), C=40% (miscalculation), D=20% (confusion).
- **Basic**: As skills improve, more students should choose B, but some might still make calculation errors. A=20%, B=60%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Students here are likely to get it right or make less common errors. A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to solve it correctly with minimal errors. A=5%, B=90%, C=2%, D=3%.

## 6: Adjust and specify the predictions
Based on the thought process:
- **below_basic**: A=25% B=5% C=40% D=30%
- **basic**: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=25% B=5% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
