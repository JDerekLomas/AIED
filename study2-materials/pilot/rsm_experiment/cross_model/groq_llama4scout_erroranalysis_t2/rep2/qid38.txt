## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors
The question requires students to add two fractions with different denominators: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \). To add these fractions, students need to find a common denominator, which in this case would be \(2x\). The correct steps involve converting \( \frac{4}{x} \) to \( \frac{8}{2x} \) and then adding it to \( \frac{3}{2x} \), resulting in \( \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \).

## 2: Identify common errors and their causes
- A common error could be adding the numerators and denominators separately without finding a common denominator, leading to \( \frac{3+4}{2x+x} = \frac{7}{3x} \) (Option B). This error is attractive because it feels natural to add the parts of the fractions directly.
- Another error could be finding a common denominator but then adding the fractions incorrectly, or not adjusting one of the fractions to have the common denominator. For example, not changing \( \frac{4}{x} \) to have a denominator of \(2x\), leading to \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} \) correctly but then mistakenly simplifying or misinterpreting the result.
- Students might also incorrectly simplify or not simplify their answers. For example, getting \( \frac{11}{2x} \) but thinking it could be simplified further into \( \frac{11}{x} \) by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2 (Option C), which is incorrect.

## 3: Analyze the options based on common errors
- Option A (\( \frac{11}{2x} \)) is the correct answer.
- Option B (\( \frac{7}{3x} \)) suggests a misunderstanding of finding a common denominator and adding fractions.
- Option C (\( \frac{11}{x} \)) might suggest that a student found the common denominator and added correctly but then divided both the numerator and denominator by 2 incorrectly.
- Option D (\( \frac{7}{2x} \)) could suggest a miscalculation in adding the fractions, such as \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{2x} = \frac{7}{2x} \), implying the student mistakenly used \( \frac{4}{2x} \) instead of \( \frac{8}{2x} \) for \( \frac{4}{x} \).

## 4: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option
- **Below Basic**: These students may not understand how to add fractions with different denominators. They might choose Option B (\( \frac{7}{3x} \)) because it seems like a straightforward addition of numerators and denominators. Option A might be chosen by a few who happened to get the right answer or guessed. Option D could be a plausible mistake. Option C seems less likely but could happen with a misguided attempt to simplify.
- **Basic**: Students at this level might understand the concept but make calculation errors. They are likely to choose Option B due to direct addition errors. Some might correctly get Option A, while others might mistakenly get Option D or C due to simplification errors.
- **Proficient**: These students should mostly get Option A correct but might occasionally slip into common errors like Option B or D, especially if in a rush.
- **Advanced**: These students are less likely to make basic errors and should mostly choose Option A. They might see through and avoid common traps.

## 5: Assignment of percentages
Based on typical performance and common errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (guessing or basic understanding), B=40% (direct addition error), C=20% (incorrect simplification), D=20% (miscalculation).
- **Basic**: A=60% (correct), B=20% (common error), C=10% (simplification mistake), D=10% (other errors).
- **Proficient**: A=85% (correct), B=10% (occasional error), C=3% (rare simplification mistake), D=2% (rare miscalculation).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (correct), B=3% (unlikely but possible error), C=1% (very rare mistake), D=1% (very rare).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1%
