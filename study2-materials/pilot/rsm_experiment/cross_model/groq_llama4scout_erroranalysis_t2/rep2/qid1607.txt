To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential errors.

The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \(k\), the correct steps involve multiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which yields \( 60 = 1 + k \), and then subtracting 1 from both sides to isolate \(k\), resulting in \( 59 = k \).

## Step 1: Analyzing Step 1
Step 1: \( 60 = 1 + k \) is correct. Multiplying both sides of the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \) by 4 indeed gives \( 60 = 1 + k \). This step is algebraically correct.

## 2: Analyzing Step 2
Step 2: \( 61 = k \) is incorrect. From \( 60 = 1 + k \), subtracting 1 from both sides gives \( 59 = k \), not \( 61 = k \). This indicates an error in the calculation or a misunderstanding of algebraic manipulation.

## 3: Identifying Calculation Errors and Attractiveness of Wrong Answers
- The error in Step 2 (\( 61 = k \)) likely arises from a simple arithmetic mistake, such as adding 1 instead of subtracting it.
- Option B (Only step 2) might appeal to students who incorrectly believe that adding 1 to 60 gives 61 and do not recognize the mistake in isolation.
- Option A (Only step 1) could be chosen by students who see the error in Step 2 but do not notice that it follows from a correct Step 1.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and equation solving. They might not even attempt to solve the equation or could make significant errors. Given the simplicity of the steps, they might be more likely to choose D (Both steps are incorrect) if they recognize an error but not the correct step, or they might choose B (Only step 2) if they mistakenly think Step 2 is correct and don't evaluate Step 1 properly.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra. They are likely to recognize the correctness of Step 1 but might make the arithmetic error in Step 2, leading them to choose A (Only step 1) as they see the mistake in Step 2.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily identify both steps' correctness or lack thereof. They are likely to choose D (Both steps are incorrect) because they know Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is not.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will quickly and accurately assess both steps. They know Step 1 is correct and Step 2 is incorrect, so they should choose A (Only step 1).

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (recognize Step 1's correctness but not properly assess Step 2), B=20% (mistakenly think only Step 2 is correct), C=10% (incorrectly think both are correct), D=40% (see both as incorrect).
- **Basic:** A=60% (see Step 1 as correct, error in Step 2), B=10% (think Step 2 is correct), C=5% (both correct, unlikely), D=25% (both incorrect).
- **Proficient:** A=70% (recognize Step 1 is correct, Step 2 is not), B=5% (error in reasoning), C=5% (both correct), D=20% (acknowledge both steps' status).
- **Advanced:** A=90% (clearly see Step 1's correctness and Step 2's error), B=0% (little chance of misconstruing steps), C=0% (know both steps' validity), D=10% (might see it as a trick question).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
