## Step 1: Understand the question and the calculation required
The question requires the evaluation of the expression \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). To solve it, one must follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS: Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.

## 2: Calculate the correct answer
First, perform the multiplication: \(4 \times 2 = 8\).
Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \(3 - 5 + 8 = 3 - 5 + 8 = 6\).
So, the correct answer is \(6\), which corresponds to option A.

## 3: Identify common errors leading to incorrect answers
- Option B (\(4\)): This could result from a calculation like \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\) and then not adding the \(2\) from \(4 \times 2\), or simply miscalculating \(3 - 5 + 8\) as \(3 - 5 = -2\) and \(-2 + 4 = 2\) then \(2 + 2 = 4\) (which is incorrect because they incorrectly introduced a \(+2\) or didn't follow order of operations properly).
- Option C (\(-12\)): A possible error is calculating \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(4 \times 2 = 8\), and finally \(-2 + 8 = 6\) is not what they get; if they do \(-2 \times (3 or 4)\) incorrectly or just add/subtract wrongly, \(-2 + (-10) = -12\) (indicating they didn't do \(4*2\) correctly or applied wrong operations).
- Option D (\(-10\)): This could result from doing \(5 + 4 = 9\), \(3 - 9 = -6\), and \( -6 \times 2\) or simply \(3 - (5 + 8)\) which shows a poor understanding of order of operations.

## 4: Assess which errors are attractive and likely to occur at different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to make straightforward calculation errors and not follow any order of operations. They might calculate \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\) as \(3 - 5 + 8 = 1\) (incorrectly), or simply add/subtract from left to right without multiplying: \(3 - 5 = -2\), \(-2 + 4 = 2\), \(2 \times 2 = 4\) (shows misunderstanding).
- **Basic**: These students might get the multiplication right (\(4 \times 2 = 8\)) but then calculate \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 8 = 6\), showing they can do the multiplication but might still make addition/subtraction errors, or they calculate directly without order: \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\) then \(2 \times 2 = 4\) for B, showing procedural misunderstanding.
- **Proficient**: Students here likely do the multiplication first (\(8\)) but could subtract/add wrong: \(3 - 5 = -2\), \(+8 = 6\) (getting A right), errors here might reflect momentary lapses or rushing.
- **Advanced**: Few errors expected, those made might reflect quick mental math errors or assumptions.

## 5: Predict percentages based on errors and typical student performance
Given typical errors, and ordering in a more 'logical guess':
- **Below Basic**: Often results in no application of BIDMAS. Thus A=20% (get it somewhat right, maybe by coincidence), B=30% (random operational mistakes), C=20% (miscalculation towards more extreme negative), D=30% (alternative logical steps giving extreme wrong).
- **Basic**: These might understand multiplication but mishandle afterwards. A=40%, B=35%, C=12%, D=13%.
- **Proficient**: Should mainly do correct or identifiable mistake like B. A=70%, B=20%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Accurate BIDMAS use primarily expected: A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final prediction given the common misconceptions might adjust somewhat; logically placing emphasis on who understands the method and who might randomly pick.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=25% D=35%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
