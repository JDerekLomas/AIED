## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors
The question requires students to compare the values of two expressions: $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$. The correct solution involves following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 2: Calculate the correct values of the expressions
First, calculate $8+12 \div 4$. Following BODMAS, we do division before addition: $12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8 + 3 = 11$.

## 3: Calculate the second expression
For $(8+12) \div 4$, following BODMAS, we do operations inside the parentheses first: $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.

## 4: Compare the expressions
Comparing the two results: $11$ and $5$, it's clear that $8+12 \div 4 > (8+12) \div 4$. So, the correct answer is A) $>$.

## 5: Identify common errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error is to ignore the order of operations or misapply it, leading to incorrect calculations.
- For option B) $<$, students might incorrectly calculate both expressions as if they were equal or apply a wrong operation order.
- Option C) $=$ might be chosen by students who incorrectly think the expressions are equal, possibly due to a misunderstanding of the order of operations or a calculation mistake.
- Option D) $\geq$ might be chosen by students who see that one expression could be greater than or equal to the other but are unsure of the exact relationship.

## 6: Analyze errors for each option
- Option A) $>$ is correct. Students who follow BODMAS correctly will choose this.
- Option B) $<$, students might choose if they calculate $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$ for the first expression (incorrectly applying operations) or simply miscalculate.
- Option C) $=$ could be chosen by those who mistakenly think $8+12 \div 4 = (8+12) \div 4$ without proper calculation, or calculate both as 5 or 11 without correct operations.
- Option D) $\geq$ might attract students who are hesitant but know $>$ is a possibility.

## 7: Predict percentage choices based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students often lack understanding of basic mathematical operations and the order of operations. They might randomly select or choose based on very basic misunderstandings. Expect high percentages in B, C, and D due to confusion.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have some understanding but may struggle with applying the order of operations correctly. They might lean towards C) $=$ due to a simplistic view or B) $<$.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations and can apply it. They are likely to choose A) $>$ correctly but some might still fall into traps.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the order of operations but can also analyze the expressions quickly. They are most likely to choose A) $>$.

## 8: Assign percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some get it right by chance), B=30% (miscalculation), C=30% (think they are equal), D=20% (hesitant).
- **Basic**: A=40% (understand order of operations somewhat), B=25% (incorrect calculation), C=25% (equals), D=10% (not commonly chosen).
- **Proficient**: A=70% (most understand and apply BODMAS), B=15% (some calculation mistakes), C=10% (less common), D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=90% (strong understanding), B=5%, C=5%, D=0%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=5% D=0%
