## Step 1: Understand the algebraic convention for division
The correct algebraic convention for \( c \div (h+4) \) is to write it as \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), because division by an expression is conventionally represented as a fraction with that expression as the denominator.

## 2: Identify the incorrect options and potential calculation errors
- Option A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \) is the correct representation.
- Option B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \) suggests adding 4 to \( c \) before dividing, which is incorrect.
- Option C: \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \) implies dividing \( c \) by \( h \) and then adding 4, which incorrectly distributes the operations.
- Option D: \( \frac{h+4}{c} \) suggests dividing \( h+4 \) by \( c \), which is the inverse operation.

## 3: Analyze potential errors for "attractiveness" and student likelihood to fall into traps
- Students who are not proficient in algebraic conventions might find Option B attractive because it seems to include all parts of the original expression in a simple fraction.
- Option C might attract students who are used to solving equations with operations distributed (e.g., \( 2(x+3) = 2x + 6 \)) and mistakenly apply similar logic here.
- Option D could appeal to students who confuse the order of operations or are unsure about how to represent division by an algebraic expression.

## 4: Predict percentages based on student ability levels
## below_basic
Students at this level often struggle with basic algebraic concepts and may not understand the correct representation of division by an expression. They might be attracted to simpler or more straightforward representations:
- A (correct): 20% (some might recognize the format)
- B: 30% (adding inside the numerator seems intuitive)
- C: 25% (distributing operations is a common misunderstanding)
- D: 25% (inverting the fraction could be a guess)

## basic
At this level, students have a basic understanding but might still struggle with subtle aspects of algebra:
- A (correct): 50% (understand the division by an expression)
- B: 20% (less likely to add inside the numerator correctly)
- C: 20% (some might distribute)
- D: 10% (less likely to invert)

## proficient
Proficient students should have a solid grasp of algebraic conventions:
- A (correct): 80% (clear understanding of division by a expression)
- B: 10% (some might make a careless mistake)
- C: 5% (less likely to distribute incorrectly)
- D: 5% (unlikely to invert)

## advanced
Advanced students are likely to have a very strong understanding and minimal errors:
- A (correct): 95% (comfortable with algebraic representation)
- B: 3% (rare mistake)
- C: 1% (very unlikely)
- D: 1% (very unlikely)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
