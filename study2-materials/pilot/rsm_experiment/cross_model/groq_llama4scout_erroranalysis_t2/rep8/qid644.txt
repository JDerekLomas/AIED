## Step 1: Understand the question
The question requires multiplying the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\).

## 2: Calculate the correct answer
The product of \(-1\) and \(-4\) is \(4\), because multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result.

## 3: Identify the correct option
Given the calculation, the correct answer is \(+4\), which corresponds to option A.

## 4: Analyze potential errors for each wrong option
- Option B \(-4\): This would result from \(-1 \times 4\) or \(1 \times -4\), not relevant here but indicates a possible misunderstanding of negative number multiplication.
- Option C \(+5\): This doesn't directly relate to a simple multiplication error of \(-1\) and \(-4\).
- Option D \(-5\): Similarly, this doesn't directly relate to a simple multiplication error of \(-1\) and \(-4\).

## 5: Determine the specific calculation errors
- The error leading to B (\(-4\)) could be forgetting that two negatives make a positive.
- The errors leading to C (\(+5\)) and D (\(-5\)) are less straightforward and might involve more complex mistakes or incorrect operations.

## 6: Assess which errors are attractive
- The error in B (\(-4\)) is attractive because it might seem like a simple mistake to forget the two negatives make a positive.
- Errors leading to C and D seem less natural as they don't directly follow from common multiplication mistakes with negatives.

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication, especially with negatives. They might choose B (\(-4\)) because they forget that multiplying two negatives gives a positive, or they might choose randomly.
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic operations but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to choose A (\(+4\)) but might be tempted by B (\(-4\)) if they're unsure about the negative multiplication rule.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the rules and are less likely to make simple mistakes. They should mostly choose A (\(+4\)).
- **Advanced**: These students are confident and accurate in their calculations. They will almost certainly choose A (\(+4\)).

## 8: Estimate percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=60% (simple correct answer might be challenging), B=30% (forgetting negative times negative), C=5%, D=5%.
- **Basic**: A=80% (most understand basic multiplication), B=15% (some forget), C=2%, D=3%.
- **Proficient**: A=95% (understand and apply correctly), B=4% (occasional slip), C=0.5%, D=0.5%.
- **Advanced**: A=99% (accurate application), B=1% (rare mistake), C=0%, D=0%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
proficient: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
