To approach this question, let's first analyze the problems and the operations involved, then consider the common mistakes students might make based on their level of understanding.

## Step 1: Understanding the Problems
Problem P is \( 4 - 5 + 6 = \) and Problem Q is \( 4 + 5 \times 6 = \). 

## 2: Identifying Correct Procedures
For Problem P, since it's straightforward addition and subtraction from left to right, the correct order is \( 4 - 5 + 6 \), which means doing \( 4 - 5 \) first. 
For Problem Q, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication comes before addition, so \( 5 \times 6 \) should be done first.

## 3: Analyzing Options
- A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - Incorrect for Q because it ignores the multiplication.
- B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Correct for both; \( 4-5 \) is the first operation in P, and \( 5 \times 6 \) is the first in Q.
- C: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - Incorrect because it misorders operations for both problems.
- D: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Incorrect for P but correct for Q.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level often lack a basic understanding of mathematical operations and their order. They might randomly choose or follow an intuitive but incorrect approach.
- **Basic:** Students here have a basic grasp but may struggle with applying the order of operations consistently, especially in more complex expressions.
- **Proficient:** These students understand and can apply basic mathematical operations and the order of operations for simple expressions.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, including the order of operations, and can apply them to solve problems accurately.

## 5: Estimating Response Percentages
- **Below Basic:** 
  - A might seem intuitive but incorrect for Q, B seems logical but requires understanding, C and D might seem confusing. Given that basic understanding is lacking, random or intuitively wrong choices might dominate. So, A=30%, B=10%, C=30%, D=30%.
- **Basic:** 
  - These students might start to understand the sequence but could still make mistakes. B seems the most logical for those who understand order of operations; A=20%, B=40%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Proficient:** 
  - Understand the operations but might still make occasional mistakes. The correct approach (B) should be dominant. So, A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** 
  - These students are likely to nearly always choose the correct option due to their strong understanding. A=0%, B=95%, C=0%, D=5%.

The best answer is B. 

Given the instructions, here's the formatted response based on analysis:

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
