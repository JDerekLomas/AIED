## Step 1: Understand the question
The question provides a table of values for the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) and asks to find the value that should replace the star (\(\bigstar\)) when \(x = 0\).

## 2: Solve the equation for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
To find \(y\) when \(x = 0\), substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\).
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]
\[y = 5\]

## 3: Identify the correct answer
The correct calculation yields \(y = 5\) when \(x = 0\), which corresponds to option C.

## 4: Analyze potential calculation errors for each wrong answer
- Option A (\(20\)): This could result from a calculation error such as \(4(0) + 2y = 10\) leading to \(2y = 10 \times 4 = 40\), hence \(y = 20\). This mistake involves incorrect manipulation of the equation.
- Option B (\(3\)): This might come from \(2y = 10 - 4 = 6\), hence \(y = 3\). This error could stem from mistakenly trying to solve for \(y\) with an incorrect substitution or algebraic mistake.
- Option D (\(2.5\)): This could be from \(4x + 2y = 10\) becoming \(2y = 10 - 4x\), and then for \(x = 0\), \(2y = 10\), but if they incorrectly solved it as \(y = 10 / 4 = 2.5\), it shows a misunderstanding of the equation's structure.

## 5: Consider which errors are attractive and who might fall into these traps
- Students below basic might not understand how to substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation properly or might not perform the division correctly, leading to a variety of incorrect answers.
- Basic students might understand substitution but make arithmetic mistakes, such as option A if they incorrectly multiply.
- Proficient students are likely to get it right but might be tempted into incorrect options if they've made a minor arithmetic mistake.
- Advanced students would likely identify the correct answer easily but might double-check their work.

## 6: Predict percentages based on common mistakes and understanding
- **Below Basic**: These students might not even attempt algebraic substitution correctly. Option A (\(20\)) might appeal due to a miscalculation (\(2y = 40\)), option B (\(3\)) from incorrect arithmetic, and option D (\(2.5\)) from dividing incorrectly. Given their struggles, C (\(5\)) might be chosen by those who stumble upon it by guessing or simple trial and error, but errors would be common. Let's assume A=30%, B=20%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here understand the basics but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. Option C (\(5\)) seems straightforward, but mistakes could lead to other options. Perhaps A=15%, B=20%, C=50%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to solve it correctly but might get tricked into minor errors. So, A=5%, B=5%, C=80%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: These students would likely solve it correctly without issues. So, A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 7: Convert predictions into requested format
Based on step 6, let's format the predictions:
- below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- basic: A=15% B=20% C=50% D=15%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
