## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to compare the values of two expressions: \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\), and determine which symbol (\(>, <, =, \geq\)) belongs in the box to make the statement true.

## 2: Evaluating the Expressions
First, let's evaluate the expressions correctly using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).
- For \(8+12 \div 4\): \(12 \div 4 = 3\), then \(8 + 3 = 11\).
- For \((8+12) \div 4\): \(8 + 12 = 20\), then \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 3: Comparing the Expressions
Comparing the two results: \(11 > 5\), so the correct symbol to use is \(>\).

## 4: Identifying Potential Errors
- A common error might be to ignore the order of operations or to misapply it. For instance, calculating \(8 + 12 \div 4\) as \(20 \div 4 = 5\), which would incorrectly suggest \(=\).
- Another error could be adding first in the second expression when it's already correctly grouped: \((8+12) \div 4\) is correctly calculated as \(20 \div 4 = 5\), but some might mistakenly calculate \(8 \div 4 + 12 \div 4 = 2 + 3 = 5\), coincidentally getting it right but for the wrong reason.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to make significant calculation errors and not follow the order of operations. They might calculate everything from left to right or make random errors. Expect a high percentage of incorrect answers across all options, but particularly in B (\(<\)) and C (\(=\)) due to miscalculations.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the basics of order of operations but could still make mistakes, especially if they're not confident. They might incorrectly calculate \(8 + 12 \div 4\) as \(20 \div 4 = 5\), leading them to choose C (\(=\)).
- **Proficient**: These students understand and can apply the order of operations. They are less likely to choose B (\(<\)) or C (\(=\)) but might still be tempted by D (\(\geq\)) if they're unsure or think the values could be equal or if one is greater but not strictly.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Given the correct answer is A (\(>\)), and based on common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some get it right by chance or very basic understanding), B=30% (think the second expression is larger), C=40% (think they are equal), D=10% (unlikely but some confusion).
- **Basic**: A=50% (understand order of operations but might make calculation mistakes), B=20% (miscalculate the second expression), C=25% (still unsure about order of operations), D=5% (less likely to consider greater or equal without solid understanding).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (clear understanding of order of operations), B=5% (very few would mistakenly think the second is larger), C=10% (some still have doubts), D=5% (seeing \(>\) but also considering \(\geq\)).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (strong understanding, very few mistakes), B=0% (very unlikely to make basic mistakes), C=3% (extremely confident in \(>\)), D=2% (mostly see \(>\) but might also consider \(\geq\)).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=3% D=2%
