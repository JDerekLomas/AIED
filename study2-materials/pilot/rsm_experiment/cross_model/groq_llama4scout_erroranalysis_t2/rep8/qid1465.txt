To approach this, let's first analyze the question and the potential pitfalls for students of different abilities.

The expression given is \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), the correct steps are:

1. Multiply 4 by 2: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Then, add and subtract from left to right: \(3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6\)

So, the correct answer is A) \(6\).

## Step 1: Identifying Common Errors
- A common error would be to ignore the order of operations and perform the operations from left to right: \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 = 3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6\). However, some might mistakenly calculate it as \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 = 2\), and finally \(2 \times 2 = 4\), which leads to option B) \(4\).
- Another error could be calculating \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(4 \times 2 = 8\), and finally \(-2 + 8 = 6\), which is correct, but some might miscalculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\) and then do \(-2 \times 8 = -16 + 3 - 5 = -18\), or simply add and subtract incorrectly.
- A calculation error leading to C) \(-12\) could involve \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\), then \(2 \times 2 = 4\), or mistakenly \(3 - 5 = -2\), \(4 \times 2 = 8\), and doing \(-2 + 8 = 6\) but somehow ending up with \(-12\).
- For D) \(-10\), one might calculate \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(4 \times 2 = 8\), and finally \(-2 - 8 = -10\).

## 2: Assessing Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to make significant errors. They might ignore the multiplication altogether, doing \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\), then add \(2\), getting \(4\), or simply perform operations incorrectly without following any order.

## 3: Predicting Percentages
Given the errors identified:
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to choose options reflecting basic addition/subtraction or complete misunderstanding. B) \(4\) seems plausible due to misunderstanding the operations (A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%).
- **Basic**: Students here may start to apply some correct operations but still make errors. A) \(6\) might seem correct to some upon re-evaluation (A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%).
- **Proficient**: These students should largely get it correct but may catch themselves if they make an initial mistake. A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: These are likely to get it correct with minimal errors (A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
