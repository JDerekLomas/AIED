To approach this question, let's first analyze the steps given and identify any calculation errors that lead to each wrong answer. The equation provided is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). 

## Step 1: Solve the equation correctly to understand the correct steps.
To solve for \(k\), we first multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which yields \( 60 = 1 + k \). Then, we subtract 1 from both sides to solve for \(k\), resulting in \( k = 59 \).

## 2: Analyze Step 1 of Isaac's solution.
Isaac's Step 1 is \( 60 = 1 + k \), which is correct based on our solution in Step 1. Multiplying both sides of the original equation by 4 gives \( 60 = 1 + k \), so Step 1 is indeed correct.

## 3: Analyze Step 2 of Isaac's solution.
Isaac's Step 2 is \( 61 = k \), which is incorrect based on our correct solution. The correct calculation after Step 1 is \( k = 60 - 1 = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 4: Identify the calculation error leading to each wrong answer.
- The error in Step 2 is adding 1 to 60 instead of subtracting 1 from 60.
- Option A (Only step 1) is correct for those who see Step 1 as correct but Step 2 as incorrect.
- Option B (Only step 2) would be chosen by those who incorrectly think Step 2 is right and Step 1 is wrong, which is not possible given the dependency of Step 2 on Step 1.
- Option C (Both steps are correct) would be chosen by those who incorrectly validate both steps.
- Option D (Both steps are incorrect) would be chosen by those who see errors in both steps.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option.
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not fully understand the steps or how to verify them. They could be attracted to incorrect options due to a lack of understanding. 
  - A: **40%** (they see Step 1 as obviously correct but might get confused)
  - B: **10%** (unlikely, as they might not understand why Step 2 is wrong)
  - C: **20%** (some might incorrectly think both are correct due to confusion)
  - D: **30%** (some might see both as wrong but not articulate why)

- **Basic**: These students understand basic algebra but might make careless mistakes.
  - A: **60%** (they correctly identify Step 1 as correct and see the mistake in Step 2)
  - B: **5%** (unlikely, as they should see the dependency and error)
  - C: **10%** (some might still get confused)
  - D: **25%** (they see the error in Step 2 and might question Step 1's correctness due to the mistake in Step 2)

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebra and can identify correct and incorrect steps.
  - A: **80%** (clearly see Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect)
  - B: **0%** (understand the logical sequence and errors)
  - C: **5%** (very few might still get it wrong)
  - D: **15%** (understand both steps' validity)

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand algebra but can also critically evaluate mathematical steps.
  - A: **90%** (easily identify Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect)
  - B: **0%** (see the mistake clearly)
  - C: **0%** (understand why Step 2 is incorrect)
  - D: **10%** (might see both steps with critical eyes)

The best answer is below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=5% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=80% B=0% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
