## Step 1: Understanding the question and the potential errors
The question requires students to understand how to isolate a variable in an equation. The given equation is \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \). To solve for \( x \), one must first isolate \( \frac{x}{3} \) by adding 5 to both sides, which yields \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). This matches Tom's suggestion.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's suggestion
Tom's suggestion, \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \), is a correct next line of working because adding 5 to both sides of the equation \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) indeed results in \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \). This step demonstrates a basic understanding of maintaining equality in an equation.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's suggestion
Katie's suggestion, \( x - 5 = 36 \), seems to misunderstand the original equation. If we multiply every term in the original equation by 3 to clear the fraction, we get \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \). This implies Katie may have incorrectly multiplied the terms or confused the operations.

## 4: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with even the simplest algebraic manipulations. They might not fully understand the concept of isolating a variable or the properties of equations. They could incorrectly choose any option due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Basic level students understand simple algebra but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to recognize Tom's step as correct but may be confused by Katie's, potentially leading them to choose A (Only Tom) or possibly D (Neither is correct) if they see the mistake in Katie's suggestion.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students have a solid grasp of algebra and can apply it correctly. They will easily see that Tom is correct and Katie is incorrect, leading them to choose A (Only Tom).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the algebra but can also analyze the steps critically. They will immediately confirm Tom's correctness and identify Katie's mistake, also choosing A (Only Tom).

## 5: Estimating the percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: These students might guess randomly or choose based on partial understanding. Let's estimate D (Neither is correct) as a potentially attractive option due to confusion, A=20%, B=15%, C=10%, D=55%.
- **Basic**: Students here are more likely to understand Tom's correct step but might be tricked by Katie's. So, A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: With a solid understanding, these students will mostly choose A. Thus, A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: These students will have no trouble identifying Tom's correctness and Katie's error, leading to A=90%, B=0%, C=5%, D=5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
