## Step 1: Understand the question and the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere. To find the radius \(r\) in terms of \(V\), we need to rearrange this formula.

## 2: Rearrange the volume formula to solve for \(r\)
Starting with \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), we first multiply both sides by \(\frac{3}{4\pi}\) to get \(r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\). Then, taking the cube root of both sides gives \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\).

## 3: Identify the correct answer
From the rearranged formula, the correct answer is \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\), which corresponds to option C.

## 4: Analyze potential calculation errors leading to wrong answers
- Option A: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \) seems to confuse the formula by not correctly isolating \(r\). This might occur if a student mistakenly uses \(4\pi\) in the numerator instead of just \(\pi\) and also misplaces the \(3\).
- Option B: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \) could result from a student correctly isolating \(r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\) but then mistakenly taking \(4\) out of the denominator and not correctly handling \(\pi\).
- Option D: \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \) suggests a misunderstanding of the cube root application and possibly incorrectly applying the formula.

## 5: Consider which errors are attractive and who might fall into these traps
- Students at the lower end (below_basic and basic) might not fully understand how to manipulate the formula and are more likely to make errors in handling constants (like \(4\), \(3\), and \(\pi\)), leading them to options A and B.
- A common mistake for less confident students is to misplace or incorrectly use constants, making option B a plausible but incorrect choice for basic students.
- Proficient students are likely to understand the formula but might get distracted by the structure of the question, potentially leading them to consider option A if they reverse the operations or misinterpret the formula.
- Advanced students are expected to handle the formula correctly and are less likely to make simple algebraic mistakes.

## 6: Estimate percentages based on common errors and understanding
Given the nature of the errors and the typical understanding at each level:
- **below_basic**: These students often struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and might randomly select or make significant errors. They could be attracted to A or D due to not fully understanding the formula, so A=40%, B=30%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **basic**: Students here have a better grasp but still make mistakes. They might choose B or A more frequently than C due to mishandling the constants, so A=30%, B=40%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **proficient**: These students have a solid understanding and are less likely to make simple errors. They might mistakenly choose A due to a slip in the algebra, so A=20%, B=10%, C=60%, D=10%.
- **advanced**: These students are very familiar with the formulas and the algebraic manipulations required. They are most likely to choose C and least likely to be misled by incorrect formulas, so A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
