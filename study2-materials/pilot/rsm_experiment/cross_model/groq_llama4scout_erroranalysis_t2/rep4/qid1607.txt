To solve the equation and evaluate Isaac's steps, let's first solve the equation properly and then analyze the steps.

## Step 1: Solve the equation properly
The given equation is \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\). To solve for \(k\), we first multiply both sides by 4:
\[15 \times 4 = 1 + k\]
\[60 = 1 + k\]
Then, we subtract 1 from both sides:
\[60 - 1 = k\]
\[k = 59\]

## 2: Evaluate Isaac's steps
Isaac's Step 1: \(60 = 1 + k\). This step is correct because multiplying both sides of the original equation by 4 yields \(60 = 1 + k\).

Isaac's Step 2: \(61 = k\). This step is incorrect because subtracting 1 from both sides of \(60 = 1 + k\) gives \(k = 59\), not \(61\).

## 3: Analyze the options
- A: Only step 1 is correct. This is true based on our evaluation.
- B: Only step 2 is correct. This is false because step 2 is incorrect.
- C: Both steps are correct. This is false because step 2 is incorrect.
- D: Both steps are incorrect. This is false because step 1 is correct.

## 4: Predict the percentage at each ability level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not even attempt to verify Isaac's steps or might do so incorrectly. Given the simplicity of the correct step and the obvious error in step 2, these students might mistakenly think both steps are correct or both are incorrect due to a lack of understanding. However, recognizing the error in step 2 might be challenging, so they could lean towards thinking both are incorrect or only step 1 is correct if they've done the calculation. **A=30%, B=10%, C=10%, D=50%**
  
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra and can likely see that step 1 is correct but might make the mistake in step 2 themselves. They might choose A (only step 1 is correct) because they can do the multiplication but not correctly solve for \(k\). **A=40%, B=15%, C=5%, D=40%**

- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to correctly identify that step 1 is correct and step 2 is incorrect. They understand the algebra well enough to see that \(60 = 1 + k\) leads to \(k = 59\), not \(61\). So, they would mostly choose A. **A=60%, B=5%, C=5%, D=30%**

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and can easily verify Isaac's steps. They would quickly identify that step 1 is correct but step 2 is incorrect, leading them to choose A. **A=80%, B=0%, C=0%, D=20%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=10% D=50%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=5% D=40%
proficient: A=60% B=5% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=80% B=0% C=0% D=20%
