To approach this question, let's analyze the problems and the typical errors students might make.

## Step 1: Understanding the Problems
Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \), and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). In Problem P, operations are performed from left to right since all operations are of the same level (addition and subtraction). In Problem Q, multiplication should be performed before addition due to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

## 2: Identifying Correct Calculations
For Problem P, the correct order is \( 4-5+6 \), which is calculated as \( (4-5) + 6 \) or simply from left to right: \( 4 - 5 = -1 \), then \( -1 + 6 = 5 \). For Problem Q, the correct order is to do the multiplication first: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \), then \( 4 + 30 = 34 \).

## 3: Analyzing Options
- Option A suggests for Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and for Problem Q: \( 4+5 \). This is incorrect for Problem Q because it doesn't follow the order of operations.
- Option B suggests for Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and for Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \), which is correct for both following the order of operations.
- Option C suggests for Problem P: \( 5+6 \) and for Problem Q: \( 4+5 \), which does not correctly apply the order of operations to either problem.
- Option D suggests for Problem P: \( 5+6 \) and for Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \), which correctly identifies the operations to prioritize in Problem Q but incorrectly suggests \( 5+6 \) for Problem P.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may not fully understand the order of operations. They might choose options that seem natural or straightforward without applying rules. They could mistakenly choose A or C because they don't recognize the need for a specific order in Problem P or apply it incorrectly in Problem Q. Option B seems correct but might be less familiar. **Below Basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%**
- **Basic**: These students have a basic understanding but might still make simple mistakes. They are more likely to recognize the correct order of operations for Problem Q but might struggle with the sequence in Problem P. **Basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%**
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should understand the order of operations well. They should recognize that Problem P is done from left to right and Problem Q requires multiplication first. Thus, they should predominantly choose B. **Proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%**
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand but can apply the rules accurately and efficiently. They would definitely choose B as it correctly states the operations to perform first in each problem according to the order of operations. **Advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
