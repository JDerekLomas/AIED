## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct method involves using the FOIL technique (First, Outer, Inner, Last) or the distributive property.

## 2: Calculating the Correct Answer
To find the correct answer, we apply the FOIL technique:
\((m-5)(m-7) = m(m) + m(-7) - 5(m) - 5(-7)\)
\(= m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\)
\(= m^2 - 12m + 35\)
So, the correct answer is B) \(m^{2}-12m+35\).

## 3: Analyzing Wrong Answers
- A) \(m^{2}-2m-35\): This would result from incorrectly adding the middle terms, \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\), but mistakenly calculating \(-7m - 5m = -2m\).
- C) \(m^{2}+12m+35\): This could come from \(m^2 + 7m + 5m + 35 = m^2 + 12m + 35\), incorrectly adding the terms instead of subtracting.
- D) \(m^{2}-12m-35\): This might result from \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35\), mistakenly subtracting 35 instead of adding it.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
### Below Basic
Students at this level often struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and may not fully understand the FOIL method or how to handle negative signs.

- A: These students might not apply FOIL correctly and could easily get \(m^2 - 2m - 35\) if they mistakenly add or subtract terms incorrectly, 40%.
- B: Unlikely to get the correct answer without understanding FOIL, 10%.
- C: Might get this if they incorrectly add the middle terms, 30%.
- D: Could get this if they miscalculate the constants, 20%.

### Basic
Students here have a foundational understanding but may make calculation errors.

- A: A plausible mistake if they incorrectly calculate the middle term, 30%.
- B: They are more likely to get this right if they understand FOIL, 50%.
- C: A less likely mistake, but still possible, 15%.
- D: Another possible error, especially if they struggle with signs, 5%.

### Proficient
These students understand FOIL and are less likely to make errors.

- A: Less likely, as they understand how to combine like terms, 10%.
- B: More likely to get the correct answer, 80%.
- C: Unlikely to make this addition mistake, 5%.
- D: Might occur if they miscalculate the signs or constants, 5%.

### Advanced
Advanced students are very familiar with algebraic manipulations and are less likely to make simple errors.

- A: Highly unlikely for advanced students to make such a basic calculation error, 2%.
- B: Very likely to get the correct answer, 95%.
- C: Extremely unlikely to add the middle terms incorrectly, 1%.
- D: Unlikely; they understand to add 35, not subtract, 2%.
