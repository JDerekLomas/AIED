To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's first analyze the question and the potential pitfalls in the calculations.

The task is to calculate the mean of the numbers 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. The correct formula for the mean is the sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers. Therefore, the correct calculation is \( \frac{0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7}{5} \).

## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). This option is incorrect because it excludes the 0 from the sum, which is a critical error since 0 does contribute to the sum.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \). This option incorrectly applies the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), suggesting that division by 5 should be performed before adding the numbers together, which is incorrect.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \). This option incorrectly excludes the 0 from the sum and also uses the wrong count of numbers (4 instead of 5).

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D is "None of them". For a student to choose this option, they must recognize that all the provided calculations (A, B, C) are incorrect.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of mean calculation. They might find Option B attractive because it seems to follow a logical sequence of operations they are familiar with, even though it's incorrect. Option A might seem right but they could miss including the 0. Option C could appeal due to simplicity. 
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless errors. They are likely to choose Option A if they realize the need for all numbers to be included but forget to actually calculate with the 0 included. Option B might trap them due to a misunderstanding of order of operations. 
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of mean and are more likely to identify the correct calculation or recognize the errors in A, B, and C. They might be less likely to choose B or C due to a better grasp of arithmetic operations and the definition of mean.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to not only understand the calculation of mean but also to critically evaluate given options. They should easily identify that only a correct formulation will yield the mean and thus might choose D if they see errors in A, B, and C.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: 
  - A: 20% (partial understanding but lacking)
  - B: 30% (simple, attractive mistake)
  - C: 20% (another type of error)
  - D: 30% (not recognizing any as correct)

- **Basic**:
  - A: 40% (common mistake excluding 0)
  - B: 25% (order of operations mistake)
  - C: 20% (wrong denominator)
  - D: 15% (recognizing errors)

- **Proficient**:
  - A: 20% (some may still make simple errors)
  - B: 10% (less likely to fall for order of operations mistake)
  - C: 5% (should recognize denominator error)
  - D: 65% (recognize need for correct formulation)

- **Advanced**:
  - A: 5% (unlikely to make basic error)
  - B: 0% (should understand order of operations)
  - C: 0% (recognize as incorrect)
  - D: 95% (critical evaluation leads to correct conclusion)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
