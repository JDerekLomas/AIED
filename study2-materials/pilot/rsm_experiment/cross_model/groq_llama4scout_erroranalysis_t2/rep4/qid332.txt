## Step 1: Understanding the question and the potential errors
The question requires students to evaluate two proposed next steps in solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\). Tom suggests \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), and Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\). To assess who is correct, students need to understand the rules of solving equations.

## 2: Identifying the correct solution steps
To solve \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\), the first correct step would be to add 5 to both sides, resulting in \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), which matches Tom's suggestion. Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), would be incorrect because it multiplies both sides by 3 before adding 5, which is not a valid step.

## 3: Analyzing Tom's suggestion
Tom's suggestion, \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), is correct because adding 5 to both sides of the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) yields \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This step is algebraically sound.

## 4: Analyzing Katie's suggestion
Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), implies that she multiplied both sides of the original equation by 3, which would actually result in \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\). This indicates a misunderstanding of how to isolate \(x\).

## 5: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may not fully understand algebraic manipulation. They might choose an answer based on incorrect operations or misunderstand the equation. Given the simplicity of Tom's correct step, some might choose A, but many could be confused, potentially leading to D=40%, A=30%, B=20%, C=10%.
- **Basic**: Basic level students understand simple algebra. They should recognize Tom's step as correct but might be tricked by Katie's due to a lack of understanding of the equation's transformation. Expect A=60%, D=30%, B=5%, C=5%.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students are comfortable with basic algebra and should easily see Tom's suggestion as correct. They might be less likely to fall for Katie's suggestion but need to understand that Katie's method doesn't directly apply. Expect A=80%, C=15%, B=4%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students have a strong grasp of algebra and should quickly identify Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect. They understand the algebraic manipulations well. Expect A=90%, C=9%, B=1%, D=0%.

## 6: Assigning percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
- **Basic**: A=60% B=5% C=5% D=30%
- **Proficient**: A=80% B=4% C=15% D=1%
- **Advanced**: A=90% B=1% C=9% D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=5% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=80% B=4% C=15% D=1%
advanced: A=90% B=1% C=9% D=0%
