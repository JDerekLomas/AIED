To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's first understand the calculation involved. The question asks for the product of the two terms indicated by the arrows: \(-1 \times -4\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Calculation
The calculation is \(-1 \times -4 = 4\). This means the correct answer is \(+4\), which corresponds to option A.

## 2: Identifying Potential Errors
- Option B (\(-4\)) would result from a calculation error where the student forgot that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result.
- Option C (\(+5\)) and Option D (\(-5\)) do not directly result from a simple multiplication error of \(-1 \times -4\) but could come from misinterpretation or additional incorrect calculations.

## 3: Analyzing Attractive Errors
- The most attractive error is likely to be option B (\(-4\)), as it results from forgetting the rule that two negatives make a positive. Students might naturally think \(-1 \times -4 = -4\) if they haven't solidified the rule for multiplying negative numbers.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully grasp the rules of multiplying negative numbers. They are more likely to choose option B (\(-4\)) because they might simply multiply the numbers without considering the signs or apply the sign rules incorrectly. Options C and D seem less likely as they introduce an incorrect numerical value not directly resulting from the multiplication of \(-1\) and \(-4\). 
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still struggle with applying rules consistently. They might choose option B for similar reasons as below basic students. 
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the basic operations, including multiplying negative numbers. They are less likely to choose B but might still make careless mistakes. 
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to understand the concept well and choose the correct option, A (\(+4\)).

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might guess or partially understand), B=60% (common error), C=5% (unlikely but could be a guess), D=15% (another unlikely guess).
- **Basic**: A=40%, B=40% (still a common error), C=5%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=80%, B=15%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=5% D=15%
basic: A=40% B=40% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
