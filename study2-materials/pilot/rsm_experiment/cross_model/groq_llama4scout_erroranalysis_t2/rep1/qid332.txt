## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential errors
The question requires students to evaluate two proposed next steps in solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\). Tom suggests \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), and Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\). To assess these, we must understand the correct method and common errors.

## 2: Solve the equation correctly to establish a benchmark
The correct next step to solve \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) would be to add 5 to both sides, resulting in \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This matches Tom's suggestion, confirming Tom is correct.

## 3: Analyze Katie's suggestion
Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\). If we multiply the entire original equation by 3 to clear the fraction, we get \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\). This indicates Katie's suggestion is incorrect.

## 4: Identify calculation errors leading to wrong answers
- A common error might be misunderstanding how to isolate \(x\) or incorrectly applying operations to both sides of the equation.
- For option B (Only Katie), students might incorrectly think multiplying by 3 directly gives \(x - 5 = 36\), not accounting for the \(3 \times 5 = 15\).
- For option D (Neither is correct), students might incorrectly solve the equation or misunderstand both suggestions.

## 5: Assess which errors are attractive and which students would catch themselves
- Tom's correct solution (\(\frac{x}{3} = 17\)) is straightforward and aligns with standard algebraic manipulations, likely to be recognized by proficient and advanced students.
- Katie's incorrect suggestion (\(x - 5 = 36\)) might seem plausible to students who don't fully understand the effect of multiplying every term by 3 or who incorrectly apply operations.

## 6: Predict percentages based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might see Tom's step as correct but not understand why Katie's isn't, or they might not validate either properly. Given the simplicity of Tom's step, more might recognize it. However, Katie's error could be particularly confusing. **A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%**
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They should recognize Tom's step easily but might be swayed by Katie's if they don't carefully consider the multiplication by 3. **A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%**
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebra and should easily identify Tom's correctness and Katie's mistake. **A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%**
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the algebra but should also be able to quickly assess the validity of both statements. **A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%**

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
