## Step 1: Understand the question and the table of values
The table of values is for the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\). We need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\).

## 2: Solve the equation for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\):
\(4(0) + 2y = 10\),
\(2y = 10\),
\(y = 5\).

## 3: Identify the correct answer
The correct answer is \(y = 5\), which corresponds to option C.

## 4: Analyze potential calculation errors for each wrong answer
- Option A (\(20\)): This could result from a calculation error where \(2y = 10 \times 4 = 40\), then \(y = 40 / 2 = 20\).
- Option B (\(3\)): This might come from \(2y = 10 - 4 = 6\), then \(y = 6 / 2 = 3\), an incorrect substitution.
- Option D (\(2.5\)): This could result from \(4x + 2y = 10\), rearranging to \(2y = 10 - 4x\), then substituting \(x = 1\) or another value instead of \(0\), or a simple division error.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option
## Step 5.1: below_basic
Students at this level often lack basic algebraic skills and may not even attempt to substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation or may make significant calculation errors.
- A: Could be high due to random or large errors.
- B: Might choose this if they incorrectly solved the equation or substituted wrongly.
- C: Should be high because even with errors, substituting \(x=0\) and solving for \(y\) could yield \(5\) with simpler mistakes.
- D: Could be chosen due to a simple miscalculation.

## 5.2: basic
Students at this level can perform basic algebra but may make careless mistakes.
- A: Lower than below_basic, but still possible with significant calculation errors.
- B: Possible due to incorrect handling of the equation.
- C: High, as they can substitute and solve but might still make minor errors.
- D: Attractive for those who miscalculate or misunderstand the equation.

## 5.3: proficient
These students have a good grasp of algebra and are less likely to make simple errors.
- A: Low, as they should accurately calculate \(y = 5\).
- B: Low, due to accurate substitution and calculation.
- C: High, reflecting their understanding and accurate calculation.
- D: Very low, as this would require a noticeable mistake.

## 5.4: advanced
Advanced students are highly accurate and understand the equation well.
- A: Very low, as they can accurately solve the equation.
- B: Very low, due to precise calculations.
- C: Very high, reflecting their strong algebraic skills.
- D: Extremely low, as it represents a clear error.

## 6: Estimation
Given the nature of the errors and typical student responses:
- below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- advanced: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%
