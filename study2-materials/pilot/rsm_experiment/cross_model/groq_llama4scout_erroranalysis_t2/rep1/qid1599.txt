To approach this question, let's first analyze the possible calculation errors that lead to each wrong answer and consider which errors are "attractive" or more likely to occur.

The correct calculation is \( c \div(h+4) \), which translates to \( \frac{c}{h+4} \). 

## Step 1: Identifying Errors for Each Option
- Option A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \) suggests adding 4 to \(c\) before dividing, which could be a misunderstanding of how to apply the denominator within the expression.
- Option C: \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \) implies dividing \(c\) by \(h\) and then adding 4, which could result from misinterpreting the order of operations or incorrectly applying the division.
- Option D: \( \frac{h+4}{c} \) suggests swapping \(c\) and \(h+4\) and then dividing, which is a fundamental misunderstanding of division and the order of operands.

## 2: Assessing Attractive Errors
- Option B (\( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)) might be particularly attractive because it incorrectly but symmetrically adjusts both the numerator and denominator, suggesting an attempt to balance the equation but with incorrect algebraic manipulation.
- Option C (\( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)) could be attractive because it applies a straightforward but incorrect distribution of operations.

## 3: Considering Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic expressions. They might randomly choose or incorrectly apply operations. 
  - **Option A:** \( \frac{c}{h+4} \) would likely be chosen by a small percentage due to a lack of understanding.
  - **Option B:** Could attract some due to visual appeal or incorrect manipulation.
  - **Option C:** Likely to attract a significant portion due to simplistic error in operation.
  - **Option D:** Possible due to reversal confusion.

- **Basic:** At this level, students begin to grasp simple algebra. The confusion may arise from a lack of strict adherence to algebraic conventions.
  - They might make simple algebraic mistakes, leaning towards choosing options based on visible mistakes.

- **Proficient:** These students understand algebraic conventions but may still slip up under time pressure or stress.
  - **Option A** should be well understood as the most straightforward algebraic representation.

- **Advanced:** Minimal chance of selecting incorrect options; focus should purely be on adhering to order of operations.

## 4: Predicted Percentages
Given the complexity and based on generic trends of student's responses:

### Below Basic
- These students are prone to make simplistic or visual errors, or have very little knowledge of algebra but understand the question's simple context:
  A=30% (The right formula presented well), B=40% (Appears algebraically manipulable), C=25% (Reflects an addition seen), D=5%.

### Basic
- A moderate understanding with still basic or conceptual slip-ups.
  A=50%, B=35%^C=12 D=3

### Proficient
- Shows firm basic grasp; minimal slip-ups expected; solid algebraic grasp 
  A=90%, B=7^, C=2 D=1

### Advanced
- Almost guaranteed; understanding conventions.
  A nearly always 

Predictions in format based upon this consideration, 

Below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=25% D=5%
Basic: A=50% B=35% C=12% D=3%
Proficient: A=90% B=7% C=2% D=1%
Advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0% 

Final Answer: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=25% D=5%
basic: A=50% B=35% C=12% D=3%
proficient: A=90% B=7% C=2% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
