To approach this question, let's first analyze the steps given and the correct method to solve the equation \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\).

## Step 1: Correctly Solve the Equation
To solve \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\), first multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction: \(15 \times 4 = 1 + k\), which simplifies to \(60 = 1 + k\). Then, subtract 1 from both sides to solve for \(k\): \(60 - 1 = k\), which simplifies to \(59 = k\). Therefore, the correct steps should be:
1. \(60 = 1 + k\) (correct, as it directly results from multiplying both sides by 4)
2. \(k = 59\) (correct, as it results from subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation in step 1)

## 2: Analyze Isaac's Steps
Isaac's steps are:
Step \(1: 60 = 1 + k\) (correct)
Step \(2: 61 = k\) (incorrect, because he added 1 to both sides instead of subtracting 1)

## 3: Determine the Correctness of Each Step
- Step 1 is correct.
- Step 2 is incorrect because it should be \(59 = k\), not \(61 = k\).

## 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices
- A: Only step 1 is correct. This matches our analysis.
- B: Only step 2 is correct. This is incorrect because step 2 is wrong.
- C: Both steps are correct. This is incorrect because step 2 is wrong.
- D: Both steps are incorrect. This is incorrect because step 1 is correct.

## 5: Predict Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulation or checking steps. They might find step 1 hard to derive and could easily be misled into thinking step 2 is correct if they made a similar mistake. \(A = 30\%\), \(B = 40\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 20\%\)
- **Basic**: These students understand basic algebra but might make calculation errors. They are likely to identify step 1 as correct but could struggle with step 2. \(A = 50\%\), \(B = 30\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 10\%\)
- **Proficient**: Students here have a good grasp of algebra and are likely to spot the mistake in step 2. \(A = 70\%\), \(B = 15\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 10\%\)
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand algebra well but also are meticulous. They will easily spot that step 1 is correct and step 2 is incorrect. \(A = 90\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 0\%\), \(D = 5\%\)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
