To predict the percentages of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential errors that lead to each wrong answer.

The question is: \( 2 \frac{7}{10}+2 \frac{1}{4}= \) Leave your answer as a mixed number

## Step 1: Convert mixed numbers to improper fractions for easier calculation
To solve this, first convert the mixed numbers into improper fractions:
\( 2 \frac{7}{10} = \frac{(2*10) + 7}{10} = \frac{20 + 7}{10} = \frac{27}{10} \)
\( 2 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{(2*4) + 1}{4} = \frac{8 + 1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \)

## 2: Find a common denominator for the fractions
To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 20:
\( \frac{27}{10} = \frac{27*2}{10*2} = \frac{54}{20} \)
\( \frac{9}{4} = \frac{9*5}{4*5} = \frac{45}{20} \)

## 3: Add the fractions
\( \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} \)

## 4: Convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number
\( \frac{99}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20} \)

## 5: Analyze potential errors for each option
- **Option A (\( \frac{99}{20} \))**: This is the correct answer in improper fraction form. Students who are proficient or advanced and forgot to convert it into a mixed number or were not asked to but chose to leave it as an improper fraction might select this.
- **Option B (\( 4 \frac{19}{20} \))**: This is the correct answer. Students who understand the process well should select this.
- **Option C (\( \frac{99}{40} \**) : This could result from adding the fractions \( \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} \) by finding a common denominator of 40 instead of 20, leading to \( \frac{27*4}{10*4} + \frac{9*10}{4*10} = \frac{108}{40} + \frac{90}{40} = \frac{198}{40} = \frac{99}{20} \), but actually, it seems there was confusion. The real mistake here would be \( \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} \) and then mistakenly thinking \( \frac{99}{20} = \frac{99}{40} * 2 = \frac{198}{40} \) which does not align. Let's say it's a misunderstanding of fraction addition or conversion.
- **Option D (\( 4 \frac{8}{14} \))**: This seems to arise from a miscalculation or incorrect addition of fractions, potentially adding the wholes and then fractions incorrectly or converting incorrectly.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle with basic conversions and additions. They might incorrectly add the whole numbers and the fractions separately without finding a common denominator, leading to D. They could also end up with A or C due to a lack of understanding of the process.
- **Basic**: Basic students might understand the concept of adding mixed numbers but struggle with finding the common denominator or converting between mixed numbers and improper fractions. They could be attracted to A for not converting back to a mixed number or to C for misinterpreting the denominators.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students should largely choose B, but some might choose A if they forgot to convert back to a mixed number.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students should nearly all choose B.

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic**: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- **Basic**: A=30% B=50% C=15% D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=50% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
