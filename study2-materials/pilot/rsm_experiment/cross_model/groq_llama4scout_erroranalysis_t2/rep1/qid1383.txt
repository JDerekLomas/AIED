To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential errors that lead to each wrong answer.

The question is:
\[
T=k^{4}
\]
What is the value of \( T \) when \( k=-3 \) ?

To solve this, we substitute \( k=-3 \) into the equation:
\[
T = (-3)^4 = 81
\]

So, the correct answer is A) \( 81 \).

Now, let's consider the errors:

1. **B) \( 12 \)**: This could result from calculating \( (-3) \times 4 = -12 \) and then possibly confusing the operation or making a simple arithmetic mistake. However, it's more likely that students get this by doing \( -3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = -81 \) and then making a mistake, or simply not understanding the exponentiation properly.

2. **C) \( -81 \)**: This is an attractive wrong answer because it's the result of \( (-3)^4 \) if one incorrectly assumes \( (-3)^4 = -3^4 \) due to a misunderstanding of how negative numbers work with even exponents. The correct calculation for \( (-3)^4 \) yields a positive result because the exponent is even.

3. **D) \( -12 \)**: This seems to come from misinterpreting \( k^4 \) as \( k \times 4 \) or similar incorrect operations.

Given these potential errors, here's a breakdown by ability level:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of exponentiation or dealing with negative numbers. They might opt for simple arithmetic mistakes or misinterpret the operation entirely.
  - **A=40%** (some get it right by chance or simple substitution)
  - **B=20%** (mistake in calculation or misunderstanding of operation)
  - **C=30%** (applying incorrect rule for negative numbers and even exponents)
  - **D=10%** (basic arithmetic mistake)

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make careless mistakes or not fully apply the rules correctly.
  - **A=60%** (understand and apply the rule correctly)
  - **B=15%** (some confusion with operations or simple errors)
  - **C=20%** (still some confusion with negative numbers and exponents)
  - **D=5%** (less prone to basic mistakes)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well but might still make occasional errors under time pressure.
  - **A=80%** (strong understanding and application)
  - **B=5%** (minimal errors, mostly careless)
  - **C=10%** (perhaps a momentary lapse in understanding negative and even exponents)
  - **D=5%** (rare errors)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp and are less likely to make errors.
  - **A=95%** (excellent understanding and application)
  - **B=0%** (unlikely to make such basic errors)
  - **C=4%** (extremely rare error, possibly due to a momentary lapse)
  - **D=1%** (very rare)

Therefore, responding in the exact format requested:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=4% D=1%
