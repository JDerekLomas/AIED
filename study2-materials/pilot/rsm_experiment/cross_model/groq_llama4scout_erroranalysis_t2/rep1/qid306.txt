To approach this, let's analyze the problems and the common mistakes students might make.

## Problem P: \( 4-5+6= \)

In this problem, students need to follow the order of operations, which in this case is simply from left to right since the operations are addition and subtraction, which have the same precedence: \( 4 - 5 + 6 \). The correct first step is \( 4 - 5 \).

## Problem Q: \( 4+5 \times 6= \)

Here, students must follow the order of operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS/PEDMAS), which dictates that multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction. So, the correct first step is \( 5 \times 6 \).

## Analyzing the Options:

- **A**: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \). This suggests doing the addition first in Problem Q, which is incorrect according to the order of operations.
- **B**: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \). This is the correct approach.
- **C**: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \). This suggests incorrect operations for both problems.
- **D**: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \). This option incorrectly suggests adding 5 and 6 first in Problem P.

## Predicted Percentages Based on Student Ability:

### below_basic:
- Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations or might not apply it correctly. They are more likely to make basic errors.
- **A**: 30% (some understanding but easily misled)
- **B**: 20% (some correct understanding but mixed)
- **C**: 30% (wrong approach but feels natural to some)
- **D**: 20% (simple mistake)

### basic:
- Students here have a foundational understanding but can still make mistakes, especially under pressure.
- **A**: 20% 
- **B**: 40% (starting to get the hang of it)
- **C**: 20% 
- **D**: 20% 

### proficient:
- These students have a good grasp of the order of operations and are less likely to make simple mistakes.
- **A**: 10% 
- **B**: 60% (good understanding)
- **C**: 10% 
- **D**: 20% 

### advanced:
- Students at this level have a strong understanding and are unlikely to make mistakes.
- **A**: 5% 
- **B**: 80% (strong grasp of the concept)
- **C**: 5% 
- **D**: 10% 

Given these considerations, the response in the required format is:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
