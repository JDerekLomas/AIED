To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential errors that could lead to each wrong answer.

The question asks for the product of the two terms indicated by the arrows in the expression \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## Step 1: Identify the correct answer and the error leading to each wrong option.
- Correct answer: \(+4\), because \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).
- Option A: \(+4\) (Correct).
- Option B: \(-4\). This could result from a calculation error where students forget that two negative numbers multiplied together give a positive result, so \((-1) \times (-4) = -4\) is incorrect.
- Option C: \(+5\). This doesn't seem to directly result from a simple multiplication error of \(-1\) and \(-4\), but could come from misinterpreting the question or adding instead of multiplying.
- Option D: \(-5\). Similar to option C, this doesn't directly result from multiplying \(-1\) and \(-4\), but could reflect a more significant misunderstanding.

## 2: Analyze which errors are "attractive" and which students might fall into these traps.
- The error leading to option B (\(-4\)) is quite straightforward in terms of understanding what students might do; they simply might forget the rule about multiplying two negatives.
- Options C (\(+5\)) and D (\(-5\)) seem less likely to result directly from a multiplication mistake with \(-1\) and \(-4\), suggesting more substantial conceptual or careless errors.

## 3: Predict percentages based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle significantly with even basic algebraic manipulations. They might not understand the rules for multiplying negative numbers or simply not engage with the question properly.
  - A: \(50\%\) (some might guess or calculate correctly if previously taught the rule).
  - B: \(30\%\) (error in applying the rule for negatives).
  - C: \(10\%\) (random or conceptual mistake).
  - D: \(10\%\) (similar to C).

- **Basic:** These students have a foundational understanding but might still make careless or basic conceptual errors.
  - A: \(70\%\) (correct understanding of negatives).
  - B: \(20\%\) (forgetting the negative rule).
  - C: \(5\%\) (significant misunderstanding).
  - D: \(5\%\) (similar to C).

- **Proficient:** Students here have a good grasp of algebraic concepts and are less likely to make simple errors.
  - A: \(90\%\) (secure understanding).
  - B: \(5\%\) (occasional lapse).
  - C: \(2.5\%\) (unusual error).
  - D: \(2.5\%\) (similar to C).

- **Advanced:** These students are confident and likely to understand the concepts well.
  - A: \(95\%\) (very secure).
  - B: \(2\%\) (rare mistake).
  - C: \(1.5\%\) (little chance of such an error).
  - D: \(1.5\%\) (similar to C).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2.5% D=2.5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1.5% D=1.5%
