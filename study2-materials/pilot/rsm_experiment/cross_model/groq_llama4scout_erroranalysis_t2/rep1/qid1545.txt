## Step 1: Understand the question and the operations involved
The question involves a comparison between two expressions: \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\). To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction).

## 2: Solve the expressions correctly
First, solve \(8+12 \div 4\):
- Division first: \(12 \div 4 = 3\)
- Then addition: \(8 + 3 = 11\)

Then, solve \((8+12) \div 4\):
- Brackets first: \(8 + 12 = 20\)
- Then division: \(20 \div 4 = 5\)

## 3: Compare the results
Comparing the two results: \(11\) and \(5\), it's clear that \(11 > 5\). Therefore, the correct symbol to use in the box is \(>\).

## 4: Analyze potential errors and student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not follow the order of operations correctly or might not understand the symbols. They might calculate \(8 + 12 = 20\) and then \(20 \div 4 = 5\) for the first expression (ignoring the division by 4), leading them to think \(5 = 5\) or could incorrectly calculate both expressions as equal due to a lack of understanding of order of operations.
- **Basic**: Students here might start to understand order of operations but could make calculation mistakes. They might correctly calculate one but not the other or confuse the operations.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand the order of operations and calculate correctly but could be tempted by incorrect simplifications.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to not only solve the expressions correctly but also understand why one is greater than the other.

## 5: Predict student responses based on common errors
- A common error is to ignore the brackets or the order of operations, leading to wrong answers.
- For \(8+12 \div 4\), if students do \(8 + 12 = 20\) and then forget the division by 4, they'd get 20, thinking it's \(= (8+12) \div 4 = 5\), leading to \(C\) or \(D\) (if they think \(20 \geq 5\)).
- The "attractive" wrong answer might be \(C\) or \(D\) if students think the expressions are equal or if one is greater but not by much, tempting them with \(\geq\).

## 6: Estimate the percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: Might choose \(C\) (20%), thinking the expressions are equal due to poor understanding, \(B\) (30%) for random guessing, \(A\) (20%) if they managed to compute one correctly but not the other, and \(D\) (30%).
- **Basic**: More likely to choose \(A\) (40%) if they compute correctly, \(B\) (25%) if their calculations led them to believe one was less, \(C\) (20%) for incorrect equality, and \(D\) (15%).
- **Proficient**: Would likely choose \(A\) (80%), with \(B\) (10%), \(C\) (5%), and \(D\) (5%) for those slightly off.
- **Advanced**: Almost certainly \(A\) (95%), with \(B\) (3%), \(C\) (1%), and \(D\) (1%).

## 7: Assign specific percentages
Based on typical performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=10% B=30% C=30% D=30%
- **Basic**: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
- **Proficient**: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
