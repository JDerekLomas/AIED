## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct method involves using the FOIL technique: First, Outer, Inner, Last. This means multiplying the first terms in each bracket, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, and finally the last terms in each bracket, and then adding them all together.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Answer
Applying the FOIL technique:
- First: \(m \times m = m^2\)
- Outer: \(m \times -7 = -7m\)
- Inner: \(-5 \times m = -5m\)
- Last: \(-5 \times -7 = 35\)
Adding these together: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).
So, the correct answer is B) \(m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Errors
- A) \(m^2 - 2m - 35\): This could result from incorrect application of FOIL or not combining like terms correctly, specifically if a student thought \(-7m - 5m = -2m\) without accounting for the actual calculation \(-7m - 5m = -12m\).
- C) \(m^2 + 12m + 35\): This might come from a student incorrectly adding the middle terms, thinking \(-7m - 5m = +12m\) instead of \(-12m\).
- D) \(m^2 - 12m - 35\): This error could arise from a student mistakenly subtracting 35 instead of adding it, possibly due to incorrect handling of the negative signs in the multiplication.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the basic algebraic manipulations. They might not apply FOIL correctly or mix up operations.
  - A: 30% (simple mistake in combining terms)
  - B: 20% (correct but let's assume lower percentage due to potential errors)
  - C: 20% (incorrect addition of middle terms)
  - D: 30% (incorrect handling of constants and signs)
- **basic**: Students here have a grasp of basics but might make careless mistakes.
  - A: 15% (calculation errors)
  - B: 60% (significant improvement in applying FOIL correctly)
  - C: 10% (some still struggle with signs and term combination)
  - D: 15% (misinterpretation of constant term)
- **proficient**: These students understand the method but might occasionally make slips.
  - A: 5% (occasional careless mistake)
  - B: 80% (mostly accurate application of FOIL)
  - C: 5% (rare mistake in term combination)
  - D: 10% (mistake in handling constant)
- **advanced**: Students at this level are confident and accurate.
  - A: 1% (very rare error)
  - B: 95% (high accuracy in application)
  - C: 2% (rare mistake)
  - D: 2% (rare error in constant handling)

## 5: Adjusting for Realistic Expectations
Given the nature of the question and common mistakes, let's adjust the predictions to reflect realistic student performance:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
- **advanced**: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
