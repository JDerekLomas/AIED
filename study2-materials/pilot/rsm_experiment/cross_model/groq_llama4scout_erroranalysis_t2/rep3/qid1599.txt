To approach this question, let's analyze the possible errors and the algebraic conventions involved.

The correct calculation using algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \) is \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which corresponds to option A. This is because in algebra, division by an expression is represented as a fraction with that expression in the denominator.

## Step 1: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \), suggests an error where the student incorrectly adds 4 to \( c \) in the numerator. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the order of operations or mistakenly applying a rule similar to adding fractions. Students who are not secure with algebraic expressions might find this option attractive because it seems to follow a pattern of operations they're familiar with.

## 2: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \), implies a mistake where the student performs the division first (which is correct) but then incorrectly adds 4, possibly forgetting that the 4 should be part of the denominator in the original expression. This option might seem plausible to students who are used to working with simple arithmetic operations but haven't fully grasped algebraic notation.

## 3: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( \frac{h+4}{c} \), indicates a significant misunderstanding, essentially inverting the fraction and swapping the variables' positions. This could be due to a lack of understanding of what division means in algebraic terms or simply a careless mistake.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level often struggle with basic algebraic concepts. They might find option B (\( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)) attractive due to its seeming symmetry. Option C (\( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)) could also appeal due to its straightforward arithmetic-like manipulation. Option D (\( \frac{h+4}{c} \)) would reflect a more fundamental misunderstanding. Given their struggles, A might be less commonly selected.

- **Basic:** At this level, students have a grasp of basic algebra but might still make careless errors. They'd more likely recognize A as correct but have a tendency to choose B or C due to less secure understanding or mistakes in applying algebraic rules.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students generally understand algebraic conventions well. They are more likely to select A and less likely to fall for B, C, or D, given their understanding of algebraic notation.

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand algebraic conventions but can also apply them accurately in various contexts. They are highly likely to choose A and recognize the errors represented by B, C, and D.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (some understand the basics of fractions), B=40% (might add incorrectly), C=30% (simple arithmetic mistake), D=10% (fundamental error).
- **Basic:** A=50% (fair understanding), B=30% (partial understanding), C=15% (mistake in order of operations), D=5% (careless).
- **Proficient:** A=80% (solid grasp), B=15% (possible minor slips), C=4% (oversight), D=1% (rare error).
- **Advanced:** A=95% (excellent grasp), B=3% (minor errors), C=1% (rarely misinterprets), D=1% (exceptional cases).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
