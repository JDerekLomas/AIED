## Step 1: Understand the question and the likely errors
The question requires students to multiply the terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## 2: Identify the wrong answers and the calculation errors leading to them
- A: \( +4 \) is the correct answer.
- B: \( -4 \) could result from mistakenly thinking the product of two negative numbers is negative.
- C: \( +5 \) doesn't directly result from a simple multiplication error of \(-1\) and \(-4\).
- D: \( -5 \) also doesn't directly result from a simple multiplication error of \(-1\) and \(-4\).

## 3: Analyze the attractive errors
The attractive error here would be choosing B: \( -4 \) because it might seem natural to forget that multiplying two negatives gives a positive, a common mistake among students not fully secure with negative number rules.

## 4: Consider student ability levels and their likely responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand the rules for multiplying negative numbers or might not even attempt the calculation correctly. They could choose any option based on guesswork or incorrect application of rules.
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic algebra but might struggle with the nuances of negative numbers. They are likely to make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- **Proficient**: Students here should understand the rules for negative numbers but might still make careless errors under exam pressure.
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to get it right but might also be able to recognize common traps.

## 5: Predict the percentages for each option at each ability level
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: Might guess or misunderstand completely. Let's assume A=10%, B=30%, C=20%, D=40% (though this group might not engage with the question meaningfully).
- **Basic**: More likely to make a straightforward error like thinking \(-1 \times -4 = -4\). So, A=60%, B=30%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: Should mostly get it right but might have some slip-ups. Thus, A=80%, B=15%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: Almost certainly get it right. So, A=95%, B=4%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

## 6: Translate predictions into the required format
Based on typical student performance and error patterns:
- below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=20% D=40%
- basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
- proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
- advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%
