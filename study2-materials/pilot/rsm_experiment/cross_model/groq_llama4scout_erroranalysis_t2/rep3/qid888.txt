## Step 1: Understanding the question and possible errors
The question asks students to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct answer can be found using the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last), which yields \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\). This corresponds to option B.

## 2: Identifying potential calculation errors for each wrong option
- Option A: \(m^2 - 2m - 35\). This could result from incorrectly multiplying the terms: \(m \cdot m = m^2\), \(-5 \cdot -7 = 35\), but then incorrectly combining the middle terms, possibly suggesting a mistake in applying the FOIL method or a simple arithmetic error.
- Option C: \(m^2 + 12m + 35\). This might come from adding the middle terms instead of subtracting: \(m \cdot -7 + m \cdot -5 = -7m - 5m = -12m\), but then mistakenly adding \(+12m\).
- Option D: \(m^2 - 12m - 35\). This could arise from incorrectly calculating the constant term: instead of \(+35\), getting \(-35\), possibly by mistakenly multiplying \(-5 \cdot -7\) as \(-35\).

## 3: Analyzing the errors and student level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and the FOIL method. They are more likely to make significant errors, such as not understanding how to multiply out brackets or confused about the signs.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but might still make careless mistakes or not fully understand the application of the FOIL method.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the FOIL method and can apply it but might still occasionally make simple arithmetic errors.
- **Advanced:** These students are likely to have a strong grasp of algebra, understand the FOIL method, and can accurately apply it.

## 4: Predicting percentages based on error analysis
- **Below Basic:** 
  - A: This group might choose A because they incorrectly simplify, thinking \(m-5-7 = -2\), thus \(m^2 - 2m - 35\) seems plausible due to lack of understanding. (40%)
  - B: They might get the correct answer by chance or if they've memorized it without understanding. (10%)
  - C: Error in sign and constant term might lead some here. (20%)
  - D: Another plausible incorrect option due to incorrect applications of FOIL. (30%)
- **Basic:**
  - A: Simple errors in FOIL could lead to this. (30%)
  - B: Students have learned the method but accuracy can slip. (40%)
  - C: Misunderstanding of FOIL could lead to wrong signs. (15%)
  - D: Arithmetic mistake on the constant term. (15%)
- **Proficient:**
  - A: Less likely as they understand FOIL, but simple arithmetic slip-ups can happen. (10%)
  - B: Most likely to get it right. (80%)
  - C: Unlikely but a simple error. (5%)
  - D: Could happen with a careless mistake. (5%)
- **Advanced:**
  - A: Very unlikely. (2%)
  - B: Highly likely to choose the correct answer accurately. (95%)
  - C: Very low likelihood. (1%)
  - D: Very low likelihood. (2%)

## 5: Conversion to required format
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
- **basic:** A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
- **proficient:** A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced:** A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
