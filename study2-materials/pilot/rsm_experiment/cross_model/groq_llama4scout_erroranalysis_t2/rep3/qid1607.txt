## Step 1: Understand the equation and Isaac's steps
The given equation is \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \). Isaac's steps are:
Step \( 1: \) \( 60=1+k \)
Step \( 2: \) \( 61=k \)
To verify these steps, we should solve the equation properly.

## 2: Solve the equation correctly
Multiplying both sides of the equation \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \) by 4 gives:
\( 60 = 1 + k \)
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:
\( 59 = k \)
So, the correct solution is \( k = 59 \).

## 3: Evaluate Isaac's steps
Step 1: \( 60=1+k \) is correct because multiplying both sides by 4 yields this equation.
Step 2: \( 61=k \) is incorrect because, as calculated, \( k = 59 \), not 61.

## 4: Analyze the errors and predict student responses
- The calculation error leading to wrong answers involves misunderstanding the algebraic manipulation.
- Option A (Only step 1) is correct for students who see the multiplication by 4 is correct but verify that \( k = 59 \), not 61.
- Option B (Only step 2) would be chosen by students who incorrectly think Step 2 is right without checking Step 1, which seems unlikely since if they knew \( k = 61 \), they'd know Step 1 is also incorrect.
- Option C (Both steps are correct) would be chosen by students who don't understand or check the equation properly.
- Option D (Both steps are incorrect) would be chosen by students who realize Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is incorrect, or both are incorrect.

## 5: Attractive errors
The attractive error here seems to be in verifying Step 1 but then making a simple arithmetic mistake in Step 2, or not checking Step 2 against known solutions.

## 6: Predicting student responses by ability level
- **Below_basic**: These students might not fully understand the algebraic process. They might choose C (Both steps are correct) because they don't verify the steps properly, or D if they see both are wrong but can't articulate why A is correct. Let's assume A=20%, B=10%, C=30%, D=40%.
- **Basic**: These students understand basic algebra but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They might choose A because they see Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is not, B if misunderstood, C if they think both are right, or D if they know both are flawed. A might be more likely. Let's assume A=50%, B=5%, C=20%, D=25%.
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately solve the equation and critique Isaac's steps. They'd likely see Step 1 is correct and Step 2 is incorrect, choosing A. So, A=70%, B=5%, C=10%, D=15%.
- **Advanced**: These students not only solve it correctly but also understand why certain steps are correct or incorrect. They would definitely choose A, as they can verify both steps' validity accurately. Thus, A=90%, B=0%, C=5%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=5% C=20% D=25%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=10% D=15%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
