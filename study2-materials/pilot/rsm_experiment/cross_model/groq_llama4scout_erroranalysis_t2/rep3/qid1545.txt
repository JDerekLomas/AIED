## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors
The question requires students to compare the values of two expressions: \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\). To solve this, students need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 2: Calculate the correct values for both expressions
For \(8+12 \div 4\), following BODMAS, we first do the division: \(12 \div 4 = 3\), then the addition: \(8 + 3 = 11\).

For \((8+12) \div 4\), following BODMAS, we first do the operation in the parentheses: \(8 + 12 = 20\), then the division: \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 3: Compare the expressions to determine the correct symbol
Since \(11 > 5\), the correct symbol to use is \(>\).

## 4: Identify common calculation errors and misconceptions
- A common error is to ignore the order of operations or misunderstand it. For example, calculating \(8 + 12 \div 4\) as \(20 \div 4 = 5\), which would lead to choosing \(C =\).
- Another error could be calculating both expressions incorrectly, such as \(8 + 12 \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5\) and \((8+12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5\), leading to \(C =\).

## 5: Analyze each option based on likely student errors
- **Option A (\(>\))**: This is the correct answer. Students who follow the order of operations correctly will choose this.
- **Option B (\(<\))**: Students might choose this if they incorrectly calculate one or both expressions in a way that reverses the correct relationship.
- **Option C (\(=\))**: This could be chosen by students who mistakenly calculate both sides to equal 5, or by those who think the expressions are equal due to misapplication of rules.
- **Option D (\(\geq\))**: This might be chosen by students who see that one expression could potentially be greater than or equal to the other but don't accurately compute.

## 6: Estimate the percentage of students at each ability level choosing each option
### Below Basic
Students at this level often struggle with basic arithmetic and order of operations.
- They might incorrectly calculate or guess, so A=20%, B=20%, C=50%, D=10%.

### Basic
Students here have a grasp of basic operations but may struggle with applying them consistently.
- Expect some to get it right but many to make simple errors, so A=40%, B=30%, C=20%, D=10%.

### Proficient
These students understand the order of operations and can apply it but might make occasional mistakes under pressure.
- Expect most to get it right, with some choosing C due to oversight: A=70%, B=15%, C=10%, D=5%.

### Advanced
Students here are confident and accurate in their calculations and understanding of mathematical concepts.
- They are likely to choose the correct answer with high accuracy: A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=50% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
