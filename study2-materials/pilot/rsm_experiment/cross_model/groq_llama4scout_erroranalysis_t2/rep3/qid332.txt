## Step 1: Understanding the question and the potential errors
The question requires students to solve the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) and evaluate the correctness of two proposed next lines of working: \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\) by Tom, and \(x - 5 = 36\) by Katie. To assess who is correct, we need to understand the correct method to solve the equation.

## 2: Solving the equation correctly
The correct step to solve \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) involves adding 5 to both sides, which results in \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This matches Tom's suggestion, making Tom correct.

## 3: Evaluating Katie's suggestion
Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\). To see if this could be a correct next step, we multiply both sides of the original equation by 3 to get \(x - 15 = 36\), which then requires adding 15 to both sides to isolate \(x\), resulting in \(x = 51\). Katie's line \(x - 5 = 36\) would actually come from multiplying the entire original equation by 3, yielding \(x - 15 = 36\), and then adding 10 to both sides implicitly (since \(-15 + 10 = -5\)), which is incorrect. The actual correct multiplication of the whole equation by 3 gives \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\), indicating Katie's suggestion does not directly derive from a standard algebraic step applied uniformly.

## 4: Identifying the calculation error for each wrong option
- Option B (Only Katie) would be wrong because Katie's suggestion doesn't directly follow from standard algebraic manipulations of the given equation.
- Option C (Both Tom and Katie) would be incorrect because while Tom is correct, Katie's line doesn't properly follow from the original equation through standard algebraic steps.
- Option D (Neither is correct) would be wrong because Tom's suggestion is indeed a correct next step.

## 5: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand basic algebraic manipulations. They might see Tom's step as adding 5, which seems natural, but Katie's step could seem plausible if they misunderstand how to isolate \(x\). Given the lack of understanding, they might choose D (Neither is correct) or B (Only Katie) because they don't recognize Tom's correct manipulation or misunderstand Katie's. So, below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%.
- **Basic:** At this level, students understand basic algebra but might make careless errors. Tom's step is straightforward and correct, so they'd likely recognize A (Only Tom) as correct. Katie's step seems plausible to some but should be less attractive as it's less directly derived. basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%.
- **Proficient:** Students here have a solid grasp of algebra. They'll easily see Tom's correct step and quickly realize Katie's isn't standard. proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%.
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand algebra but can also evaluate the logical coherence of steps. They will certainly identify Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect based on standard procedures. advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
