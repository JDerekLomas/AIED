To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the potential calculation errors and the attractiveness of each wrong method.

## Step 1: Understanding the task
The task is to calculate the mean of the numbers 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. The correct formula for the mean is the sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers. Therefore, the correct calculation is \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \).

## 2: Analyzing option A
Option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). This option ignores the 0, which is a common error. Students might overlook the 0 because it's often considered a "non-contributory" number in addition, especially for those not fully focused on the calculation.

## 3: Analyzing option B
Option B is \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \). This option incorrectly applies the order of operations, dividing 7 by 5 before adding the other numbers. This error can be attractive because it follows a partial recall of the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) but misapplies it.

## 4: Analyzing option C
Option C is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \). This option not only ignores the 0 but also incorrectly counts the number of values, using 4 instead of 5. This could be a combination of the errors seen in options A and a misunderstanding of what constitutes the "sample size" or total count of numbers.

## 5: Analyzing option D
Option D is "None of them". This would be chosen by students who recognize that all provided calculations (A, B, C) are incorrect.

## 6: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may not fully understand the concept of mean or may make significant calculation errors. They might be attracted to options that seem simple or require less calculation, such as B, which involves a division but does not require adding all numbers correctly.

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of mean but might make careless errors. They could choose A because they forget to include 0 in the sum, or C because they misremember the number of items.

- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the concept of mean but might still make errors under time pressure. They are less likely to choose B due to its obvious flaw in following mathematical operations but might still select A or C due to oversight.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to recognize the correct formula and identify flaws in the other options easily. They should predominantly choose D if they see that A, B, and C are incorrect.

## 7: Estimating percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple omission), B=40% (errors in operation order), C=20% (additional error), D=10% (awareness of errors).
- **Basic**: A=40% (common mistake to omit 0), B=25% (mistake in operation), C=25% (additional mistake), D=10% (some awareness).
- **Proficient**: A=20% (overseen mistake), B=10% (less likely to make operation mistake), C=10% (less likely), D=60% (recognize errors).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (highly unlikely), B=5% (unlikely), C=5% (unlikely), D=85% (clear recognition of correct approach).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
