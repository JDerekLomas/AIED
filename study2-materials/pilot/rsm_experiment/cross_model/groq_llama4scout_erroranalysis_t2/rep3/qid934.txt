## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question provides a table of values for the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) and asks to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\), denoted by \(\color{gold}\bigstar\).

## 2: Solving for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
To find \(y\) when \(x = 0\), we substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\).
This gives \(4(0) + 2y = 10\), which simplifies to \(2y = 10\), and thus \(y = 5\).

## 3: Identifying the correct answer
From Step 2, the correct answer is \(C = 5\), as it matches the solution for \(y\) when \(x = 0\).

## 4: Analyzing potential errors for each option
- Option A (\(20\)): This could result from solving the equation incorrectly, such as \(4x + 2y = 10\) becoming \(2y = 10 \times 4 = 40\) when \(x = 0\), leading to \(y = 20\). This error involves misinterpreting the equation.
- Option B (\(3\)): This might come from incorrect substitution or calculation, such as \(4(0) + 2y = 10\) leading to \(2y = 8\) (perhaps due to \(10 - 2 = 8\)), giving \(y = 4\) which is not an option, indicating a miscalculation. A plausible mistake could involve division or subtraction errors.
- Option D (\(2.5\)): This could arise from \(2y = 5\) (dividing 10 by 2 and then considering \(4x = 5\) implicitly, which is incorrect), leading to \(y = 2.5\). This suggests a misunderstanding of the equation's terms.

## 5: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic substitution or make significant calculation errors. They might choose A (\(20\%\)) if they incorrectly multiply \(10\) by \(4\) or similar basic errors. B (\(3\)) and D (\(2.5\)) could also be chosen due to simple arithmetic mistakes. C (\(5\)) is less likely to be chosen if they misunderstand the equation entirely.

## 6: Estimating percentages for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (significant calculation errors, like multiplying 10 by 4), B=20% (simple mistakes), C=20% (some understanding but errors), D=30% ( misdivision or incorrect operations).
- **Basic**: A=15% (some calculation errors), B=10% (minor mistakes), C=60% (understand the method but might make small errors), D=15% (simple miscalculations).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (careless errors), B=5% (minor errors), C=80% (clear understanding and apply correctly), D=10% (some miscalculation).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (little to no chance of such errors), B=0% (understand equation), C=95% (confident and accurate), D=5% (minor lapses).

## 7: Refining estimates based on common mistakes and understanding
Given typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=40%, B=25%, C=15%, D=20%
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=15%, C=55%, D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=2%, B=2%, C=95%, D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
