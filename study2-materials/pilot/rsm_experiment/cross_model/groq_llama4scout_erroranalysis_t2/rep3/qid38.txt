## Step 1: Understanding the question and potential errors
The question requires students to add two fractions: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \). To add these fractions, students need to find a common denominator, which in this case is \(2x\). The correct calculation is \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \).

## 2: Identifying common errors and attractive wrong answers
- A common error could be not finding the common denominator correctly or adding the numerators and denominators separately: \( \frac{3 + 4}{2x + x} = \frac{7}{3x} \) (Option B).
- Another error might be adding the fractions without finding a common denominator: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3 + 4 \times 2}{2x} \) is actually correct method but if they mistakenly do \( \frac{3 + 4}{2x} = \frac{7}{2x} \) (Option D), it shows a misunderstanding.
- A more significant error could be to multiply the denominators: \( \frac{3 \times x + 4 \times 2x}{2x \times x} = \frac{3x + 8x}{2x^2} = \frac{11x}{2x^2} = \frac{11}{2x} \), but some might directly jump to incorrect simplifications.
- However, the key error here is likely to be the addition without common denominators or incorrect handling of terms: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \) becoming \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} \) is correct, suggesting \( \frac{11}{2x} \) as the straightforward answer for those who do it right.

## 3: Assessing student ability levels and predicted choices
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to make basic errors. They might not understand the need for a common denominator (Leading to D) or multiply out (incorrectly handling fractions). Prediction: A=30% (some manage common denominator), B=40% (simple error with denominators), C=10% (confusing with multiplication of numerators/denominators), D=20%.
- **Basic**: These students understand fractions but might lack precision. Errors in adding or not getting the common denominator right would direct them to B or D. Prediction: A=50%, B=25%, C=5%, D=20%.
- **Proficient**: Students here generally get it right or have a logical misconception. Most should get A, a few stuck on B or mistakenly calculating. Prediction: A=80%, B=15%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: This group has mastered fractions. Their accuracy rate should reflect deep understanding. Prediction: A=95%, B=4%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

## 4: Final Percentage Predictions
Given the expected performance:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
- **basic**: A=50% B=25% C=5% D=20%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%
