To solve this, let's analyze the problems and the options given:

Problem P: \( 4-5+6= \)
Problem Q: \( 4+5 \times 6= \)

## Step 1: Understanding the Order of Operations
In Problem P, the operations are addition and subtraction, which are performed from left to right. So, the correct order is \( 4-5 \) first, then add \( 6 \). 

## 2: Analyzing Problem P
For Problem P, the calculation should start with \( 4-5 \) because it comes first from the left. 

## 3: Understanding Problem Q
In Problem Q, there is multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication should be done before addition. So, \( 5 \times 6 \) should be calculated first.

## 4: Analyzing the Options
- Option A suggests doing \( 4-5 \) first in Problem P and \( 4+5 \) first in Problem Q, which is incorrect for Problem Q.
- Option B suggests \( 4-5 \) for Problem P and \( 5 \times 6 \) for Problem Q, which seems correct but let's review all options.
- Option C suggests \( 5+6 \) for Problem P and \( 4+5 \) for Problem Q, which is incorrect for both.
- Option D suggests \( 5+6 \) for Problem P and \( 5 \times 6 \) for Problem Q, which is correct for Problem Q but incorrect for Problem P.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often lack understanding of the order of operations. They might choose options that seem straightforward or where operations are performed in a way that feels natural but incorrect. 
  - **Problem P: \( 5+6 \) seems like an attractive error** because adding is perceived as making things bigger, and \( 5+6 \) directly involves adding, possibly seeming more appealing than subtracting. 
  - **Problem Q: Choosing \( 4+5 \) first** might seem natural because it starts from the left. 
- **Basic**: Students here have some understanding but might still make errors. They are likely to understand that in Problem P, operations go from left to right, but in Problem Q, multiplication comes first.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations well. For Problem P, they know to do \( 4-5 \) first, and for Problem Q, \( 5 \times 6 \) first.
- **Advanced**: Similar to proficient students but with a deeper understanding and less likely to make careless mistakes.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Given the above, let's estimate:
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to choose incorrect options due to a lack of understanding. Option C (\( 5+6 \) for P and \( 4+5 \) for Q) seems a likely mistake because it involves doing operations out of order without considering the correct sequence. **A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%**.
- **Basic**: Some understanding but still prone to mistakes, especially if they've not fully grasped the rules. **A=40% B=40% C=15% D=5%**.
- **Proficient**: Most will get it right; they understand following the order of operations. **A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%**.
- **Advanced**: Virtually all will choose the correct option. **A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%**.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=40% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
