## Step 1: Understand the question and the possible answers
The question asks students to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct answer can be found using the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last), which yields \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\). So, the correct answer is B) \(m^{2}-12 m+35\).

## 2: Identify common errors leading to each wrong answer
- A) \(m^{2}-2 m-35\): This could result from incorrectly adding the middle terms, perhaps \(-7m - 5m = -2m\) instead of \(-12m\).
- C) \(m^{2}+12 m+35\): This might come from adding the middle terms incorrectly as well, \(-7m - 5m = 12m\) instead of \(-12m\), possibly due to a sign error.
- D) \(m^{2}-12 m-35\): This could result from incorrectly subtracting or adding the constant terms, possibly \(-5 \times -7 = 35\) but then incorrectly applying it as \(-35\).

## 3: Consider the attractive errors
- Option A seems natural if a student mistakenly thinks \(-7m - 5m = -2m\).
- Option C might be chosen if a student mistakenly adds the \(-7m\) and \(-5m\) to get \(+12m\), likely due to not following the rules of signs properly.
- Option D seems like it could result from a error in handling the signs or the multiplication of the constants.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level choosing each option
### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and the FOIL method. They are more likely to make significant errors.
- A: 20% (simple mistake in combining like terms)
- B: 40% (might get it right by luck or basic understanding)
- C: 20% (sign error)
- D: 20% (error in constant term)

### basic
Students here have a basic grasp but are prone to simple mistakes.
- A: 15% (occasional mistake in adding terms)
- B: 60% (understand FOIL method but might make small errors)
- C: 10% (less likely to make significant sign errors)
- D: 15% (confusion with constant term)

### proficient
These students understand the FOIL method well but might make occasional careless errors.
- A: 5% (less common simple mistake)
- B: 80% (strong understanding, minor errors)
- C: 5% (rare sign error)
- D: 10% (error but less frequently)

### advanced
Advanced students are expected to have a strong grasp of algebra and make few errors.
- A: 1% (rare, careless mistake)
- B: 95% (excellent understanding, very few errors)
- C: 1% (extremely rare error)
- D: 3% (unlikely but possible error in detailed calculation)

## 5: Translate predictions into the required format
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
