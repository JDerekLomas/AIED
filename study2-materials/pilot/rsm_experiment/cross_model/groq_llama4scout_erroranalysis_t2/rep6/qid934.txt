## Step 1: Understand the question and the table of values
The table of values is for the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\). We need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\), which is represented by \(\color{gold}\bigstar \).

## 2: Solve for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
To find \(y\) when \(x = 0\), substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\).
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[0 + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]
\[y = 5\]
So, the correct answer is \(5\).

## 3: Analyze the options and potential calculation errors
- Option A: \(20\). This could result from \(4x + 2y = 10\) becoming \(2y = 10 + 4x\), then substituting \(x = 0\) but making a mistake in rearranging the equation: \(2y = 10 + 4*0 = 10\), so \(y = 5\), but if they incorrectly solve it as \(4*0 + 2y = 10 + 4*0\) (adding \(4x\) instead of substituting), they might get confused.
- Option B: \(3\). This might come from incorrect substitution or calculation, such as \(4*0 + 2y = 8\), leading to \(2y = 8\), hence \(y = 4\), but actually, it's more likely from not following the equation correctly.
- Option C: \(5\). This is the correct answer as derived.
- Option D: \(2.5\). This could result from \(4x + 2y = 10\), rearranging to \(y = (10 - 4x)/2\), then for \(x = 0\), \(y = 10/2*1 = 10/2 = 5\), but let's see why someone might pick \(2.5\): if they mistakenly thought \(2y = 10 - 4x\), for \(x = 1\), not \(0\), they'd get a wrong equation; for \(x = 0\), it directly yields \(5\), but possibly confusing with another \(x\) value.

## 4: Reason about student errors
- **Below Basic**: Students here may struggle with substitution and algebraic manipulation. They might pick A (\(20\)) if they poorly rearrange the equation or B (\(3\)) due to miscalculation.
- **Basic**: At this level, students can perform basic algebra but may make careless mistakes. They might pick D (\(2.5\)) if they half-remember the formula or B (\(3\)) or A (\(20\)) through mistaken substitutions.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand algebra but may rush or misinterpret the question. They're less likely to pick A or B but could potentially miscalculate or glance at the provided numbers.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are less likely to make calculation errors but might overthink or evaluate multiple steps wrongly, still unlikely to choose A or B.

## 5: Estimate percentages
Based on common mistakes and error patterns:
- **Below Basic**: A=\(30\%\) (big numbers appeal), B=\(20\%\) (simple miscalculation), C=\(20\%\) (those who randomly pick or truly get it right), D=\(30\%\) (confused with decimals).
- **Basic**: A=\(10\%\), B=\(15\%\), C=\(60\%\), D=\(15\%\).
- **Proficient**: A=\(5\%\), B=\(5\%\), C=\(85\%\), D=\(5\%\).
- **Advanced**: A=\(1\%\), B=\(1\%\), C=\(95\%\), D=\(3\%\).

The answer is below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
