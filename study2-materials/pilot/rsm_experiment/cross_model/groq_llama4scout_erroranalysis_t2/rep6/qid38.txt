## Step 1: Identify the correct answer and the common errors.
The correct answer involves finding a common denominator and adding the fractions: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \). This means option A is correct.

## 2: Analyze the calculation error for each wrong answer.
- Option B (\( \frac{7}{3x} \)): This would result from incorrectly adding the numerators and denominators without finding a common denominator, e.g., \( \frac{3+4}{2x+x} \).
- Option C (\( \frac{11}{x} \)): This error might occur if a student finds a common denominator but then incorrectly simplifies, e.g., \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \) then somehow mistakenly converts to \( \frac{11}{x} \).
- Option D (\( \frac{7}{2x} \)): This could result from an error like \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4*2}{x*2} = \frac{3+8}{2x} \) but mistakenly taking only one of the terms into account or another simplification mistake.

## 3: Consider which errors are "attractive" and which students are likely to make them.
- The error leading to option B feels somewhat natural because it directly adds the numerators and denominators, a common but incorrect approach for some students.
- The error for option C seems less likely as it involves a more complex mistake after correctly finding a common denominator.
- Option D could be considered if students mistakenly add the 3 and 4 but adjust for the common denominator incorrectly.

## 4: Predict the percentage at each ability level for each option.
- **Below Basic**: These students often lack understanding of basic fraction operations. They are more likely to make simple addition errors or not even attempt to find a common denominator.
  - A=20% (some manage to get the common denominator)
  - B=40% (simple addition error)
  - C=20% (random or conceptually flawed)
  - D=20% (another straightforward but incorrect manipulation)
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand the concept but may struggle with execution.
  - A=50% (correct approach but might make calculation errors)
  - B=30% (adding numerator and denominator directly)
  - C=10% (could be misinterpretation or random)
  - D=10% (simple calculation mistake)
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp but might make minor errors under pressure.
  - A=80% (mostly correct)
  - B=10% (occasional lapse into simple errors)
  - C=5% (careless mistake)
  - D=5% (another minor error)
- **Advanced**: These students are highly accurate and less prone to simple errors.
  - A=95% (accurately adds fractions)
  - B=3% (very occasional careless mistake)
  - C=1% (extremely rare error)
  - D=1% (rare but could happen under specific conditions)

## 5: Format the predicted percentages.
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
