## Step 1: Understanding the Problems
First, let's analyze the two problems given and the order of operations required for each. Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \) and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). For Problem P, since it only involves addition and subtraction, which are of equal precedence, we perform operations from left to right. Therefore, the correct order is to do \( 4-5 \) first. For Problem Q, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we must do the multiplication before addition, so \( 5 \times 6 \) should be calculated first.

## 2: Identifying Correct Answers
For Problem P, the correct calculation order is \( 4-5 \) first, which corresponds to option B for Problem P. For Problem Q, the correct calculation order is \( 5 \times 6 \) first, which also corresponds to option B. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Errors
- A common error for students who are not proficient would be to not follow the order of operations correctly or to confuse the operations. For Problem P, adding \( 5+6 \) first feels less natural because it's an addition and subtraction problem that can be easily done step by step. For Problem Q, adding \( 4+5 \) first is a very natural mistake because students might start reading the expression from left to right without applying the order of operations.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not have a strong grasp of the order of operations. They might choose an option that doesn't make sense mathematically or they might guess. Option A and C might seem plausible because they suggest a straightforward start without necessarily applying the correct rules. Option D seems obviously incorrect for Problem P because \( 5+6 \) is not the first step.
- **Basic**: Students here have some understanding but might still struggle. They are likely to choose option B as it's the correct one but might get tempted by A.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations and are less likely to make simple mistakes. They should choose option B easily.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the order of operations but can also apply it in complex situations. They would clearly choose option B.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (natural to start with the first operation), B=20% (some understanding but inconsistent), C=30% (mistaking addition for the next step), D=20% (unaware of correct sequence).
- **Basic**: A=15% (simple mistake), B=70% (understanding but careful), C=10% (some misconception), D=5% ( minimal understanding).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (occasional slip), B=90% (standard understanding), C=3% (rare mistake), D=2% (extreme rare error).
- **Advanced**: A=1% (negligible mistake), B=95% (highly competent), C=2% (very unlikely), D=2% (rare for them to err).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
