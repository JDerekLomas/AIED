To approach this question, let's first analyze the steps provided by Isaac and determine their correctness.

The given equation is \( 15 = \frac{1 + k}{4} \).

## Step 1: Correctness of Step 1
To verify Step 1, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate \(1 + k\):
\( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \)
\( 60 = 1 + k \)
So, Step 1 is correct.

## Step 2: Correctness of Step 2
For Step 2, Isaac subtracts 1 from both sides:
\( 60 - 1 = k \)
\( 59 = k \)
Therefore, Step 2 as provided (\( 61 = k \)) is incorrect because it incorrectly states \( k = 61 \) instead of \( k = 59 \).

## 3: Analysis of Errors and Student Responses
- **Calculation Error Leading to Wrong Answers**: The wrong answer in Step 2 arises from a simple subtraction error (\( 60 - 1 = 61 \) instead of \( 59 \)).
- **Attractive Errors**: The error in Step 2 might seem attractive to students who are not meticulous with their calculations or who add instead of subtract.
- **Likely Student Mistakes**:
  - **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand the basic algebraic manipulation or might not even attempt to solve the equation properly, potentially choosing any option randomly or based on a miscalculation.
  - **Basic**: These students might understand the basic operations but could make careless mistakes. They might see Step 1 as correct but then incorrectly validate Step 2.
  - **Proficient**: Proficient students are likely to identify that Step 1 is correct but might be tricked into thinking Step 2 is correct if they hastily calculate \( 60 - 1 = 61 \).
  - **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to catch both the correctness of Step 1 and the error in Step 2.

## 4: Predicting Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: These students might randomly select or choose based on an incorrect understanding. Option D seems unlikely as they might think some steps are correct. A=30%, B=20%, C=10%, D=40%
- **Basic**: Students here might see the correctness of Step 1 but could be swayed by the seeming correctness of Step 2. A=40%, B=30%, C=15%, D=15%
- **Proficient**: They are likely to see Step 1 as correct and might question Step 2. A=50%, B=20%, C=5%, D=25%
- **Advanced**: These students will likely see that only Step 1 is correct. A=80%, B=5%, C=0%, D=15%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=50% B=20% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%
