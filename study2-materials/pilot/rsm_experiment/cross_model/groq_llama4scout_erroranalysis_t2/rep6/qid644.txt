To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential errors that lead to each wrong answer.

The question asks for the product of the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## Step 1: Identify the correct answer and the calculation error leading to each wrong option.
- Correct answer: \(+4\)
- Option A: \(+4\) (Correct)
- Option B: \(-4\) (Error: Assuming one negative and one positive number, or simply forgetting that two negatives make a positive)
- Option C: \(+5\) (Error: Unrelated or incorrect calculation)
- Option D: \(-5\) (Error: Incorrectly calculating or adding/subtracting instead of multiplying)

## 2: Analyze the attractive errors.
- The most attractive error seems to be getting \(-4\) (Option B), as it might result from mistakenly applying a rule or forgetting the sign change when multiplying two negative numbers.
- Getting \(+5\) or \(-5\) seems less directly related to common multiplication errors with negatives and positives.

## 3: Consider which students are likely to fall into these traps based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication, especially with negative numbers. They are more likely to choose an answer that doesn't even seem plausible or make a simple arithmetic mistake. Option C (\(+5\)) and D (\(-5\)) could be tempting if they are not sure how to multiply \(-1\) and \(-4\).
- **Basic:** These students understand basic operations but might not always apply them correctly, especially under time pressure. They could easily choose B (\(-4\)) if they forget that two negative numbers give a positive result.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students generally have a good grasp of arithmetic operations, including multiplying negative numbers. However, they might get anxious or careless, leading to choosing B (\(-4\)) if they are in a hurry.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to have a strong understanding of the material and are less likely to make simple arithmetic errors. They are probably the least likely to choose any incorrect option.

## 4: Estimate percentages based on likely errors and student understanding.
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below Basic:** A=60% (getting it right by chance or not attempting), B=20% (some understanding but error-prone), C=5% (random guess), D=15% (another wrong guess).
- **Basic:** A=80%, B=15% (forgetting the rule for negatives), C=2%, D=3%.
- **Proficient:** A=95%, B=4%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.
- **Advanced:** A=99%, B=1%, C=0%, D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
basic: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
proficient: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
