To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question requires the application of the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## Step 1: Understand the Correct Calculation
First, calculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\), then \(3 - 5 + 8 = 6\). So, the correct answer is A) \(6\).

## 2: Identify Potential Calculation Errors
- Option B) \(4\): This could result from \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 \times 2 = -2 + 8 = 6\), but if done incorrectly as \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\), then \(2 \times 2 = 4\), indicating a misunderstanding of the order of operations.
- Option C) \(-12\): This might come from \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(4 \times 2 = 8\), and \(-2 + 8 = 6\), but if calculated as \(3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 = 3 - 9 \times 2 = 3 - 18 = -15\) or similar incorrect operations, it's less direct. A possible error is \(5 + 4 = 9\), \(3 - 9 = -6\), \(-6 \times 2 = -12\), showing a misapplication of operations.
- Option D) \(-10\): This could arise from \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(4 \times 2 = 8\), resulting in \(-2 + 8 = 6\), but an error like \(3 - (5 + 4 \times 2) = 3 - (5 + 8) = 3 - 13 = -10\), indicating confusion with the order of operations.

## 3: Analyze Attractive Errors
- The most attractive error seems to be calculating from left to right without adhering to BODMAS, such as \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\), then \(2 \times 2 = 4\), leading to option B.
- Directly jumping to operations without brackets, like considering \(3 - (5 + 4) \times 2\), leads to complex and incorrect steps.

## 4: Consider Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students here struggle with basic arithmetic and understanding of BODMAS. They are likely to make straightforward calculation errors or completely misunderstand the operations (high chance of choosing C or D due to incorrect calculations).
- **Basic**: These students understand basic arithmetic but may struggle with the order of operations. They might calculate \(3 - 5 + 4\) first, getting \(2\), then \(2 \times 2 = 4\), making B an attractive option.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level are familiar with BODMAS and can perform calculations correctly but might slip up under pressure. They are less likely to choose obviously incorrect options like C or D.
- **Advanced**: These students have a strong grasp of BODMAS and are less likely to make errors in the order of operations.

## 5: Estimate Percentages
Given the explanations:
- **Below Basic**: Likely to have high percentages in the wrong answers due to a lack of understanding. A=20% (some get it right by chance), B=30% (attractive mistake), C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: A=50%, B=30% (common mistake), C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=80%, B=15%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: A=95%, B=4%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%
