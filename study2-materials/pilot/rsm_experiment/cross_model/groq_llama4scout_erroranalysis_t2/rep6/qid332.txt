## Step 1: Understanding the question and the errors
To solve the question $\frac{x}{3}-5=12$, one needs to isolate $x$. Tom suggests adding 5 to both sides, resulting in $\frac{x}{3}=17$, which is correct. Katie suggests multiplying every term by 3, which would give $x - 5 = 36$, also a correct step. Let's examine the potential errors.

## 2: Identifying calculation errors for each option
- Tom's method involves adding 5 to both sides, which is algebraically correct: $\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5$, simplifying to $\frac{x}{3} = 17$. This method is sound.
- Katie's method involves multiplying every term by 3: $3 \times \frac{x}{3} - 3 \times 5 = 3 \times 12$, which simplifies to $x - 15 = 36$. Notice Katie's suggestion was $x - 5 = 36$, indicating a mistake in her proposed step.

## 3: Analyzing wrong answers based on common student errors
- Option A (Only Tom) would be chosen by students who understand Tom's method but not Katie's or see Katie's as incorrect.
- Option B (Only Katie) would be chosen by students who mistakenly think Katie's method is correct but Tom's isn't, or they don't spot Katie's error.
- Option C (Both Tom and Katie) would be chosen by students who correctly understand both methods or mistakenly think both are correct.
- Option D (Neither is correct) would be chosen by students who incorrectly apply algebraic rules or don't understand either method.

## 4: Predicting percentages based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often struggle with basic algebra. They might not understand why Tom's method is correct but could mistakenly think Katie's is correct due to not performing the multiplication properly. They are more likely to choose D because they don't understand either method. A=20% (some see Tom's correct step), B=30% (mistakenly think Katie's step is correct), C=10% (rarely understand both), D=40% (don't get either).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of simple algebra. They should see Tom's step as correct. If they misunderstand Katie's step, they might choose A. A=60% (understand Tom), B=20% (confused about Katie), C=15% (see both as potentially correct), D=5% (stronger understanding, less likely to dismiss both).
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebraic manipulations. They should recognize Tom's step as correct and Katie's as incorrect due to the multiplication mistake. A=80% (clearly see Tom's correctness), B=5% (unlikely to think Katie's correct), C=10% (might see both as plausible), D=5% (unlikely to dismiss both).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are confident in their algebraic manipulations. They will easily spot both Tom's correctness and Katie's mistake. A=90% (recognize Tom), B=0% (not fooled by Katie), C=5% (very few would mistakenly validate Katie), D=5% (extremely unlikely).

## 5: Assigning percentages
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
- **basic**: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
