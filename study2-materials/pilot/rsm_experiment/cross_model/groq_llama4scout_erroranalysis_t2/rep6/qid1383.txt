## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential errors
The question requires students to substitute \( k = -3 \) into the equation \( T = k^4 \) and solve for \( T \). The correct calculation is \( T = (-3)^4 = 81 \). To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, we need to consider common errors.

## 2: Identify common errors and their causes
- Option B (12) and D (-12) likely result from calculating \( k \) to the power of 1 or an incorrect power, which seems unlikely here since the operation is clearly \( k^4 \).
- Option C (-81) could result from a mistake where \( (-3)^4 \) is incorrectly calculated as \( -(3^4) \), showing a misunderstanding of exponent rules, specifically with negative bases.
- The most common error for students who are not fully proficient would be to calculate \( T \) as \( (-3)^4 \) but getting a wrong answer due to a calculation mistake or misapplication of rules.

## 3: Analyze errors for "below_basic" students
Students at the "below_basic" level often struggle with basic arithmetic and applying simple formulas. They might incorrectly calculate \( (-3)^4 \) or misunderstand the operation altogether. For these students, errors in calculation (like \( -3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3 \)) or incorrect use of rules (thinking \( (-3)^4 = -3^4 \)) are common.

## 4: Analyze errors for "basic" students
"Basic" students understand the fundamental concepts but might make simple arithmetic errors or have a tenuous grasp on rules for exponents. They are likely to calculate \( T \) correctly if they remember the rule for \( (-a)^n \) when \( n \) is even, yielding a positive result. However, they might fall into simple traps like confusion with \( -3^4 \) (which equals \( -81 \), not \( 81 \)).

## 5: Analyze errors for "proficient" and "advanced" students
Proficient and advanced students are more likely to understand the concept of exponentiation with negative bases and even exponents resulting in positive values. However, even proficient students can make careless mistakes. Advanced students are less likely to make errors due to their strong understanding.

## 6: Predict percentages based on common errors
- **Below_basic:** These students are likely to struggle significantly. Option A (correct) might be chosen by about 20% due to luck or simple memorization. Option C (-81) could be attractive to about 40% because it results from a simple mistake of applying a negative sign. Options B (12) and D (-12) might be chosen by 20% each due to incorrect exponent calculations.
- **Basic:** These students have a grasp of basics but are prone to errors. About 60% might choose A (correct) because they understand \( (-3)^4 = 81 \). Option C (-81) might appeal to about 30% because it's a straightforward but incorrect application of exponent rules. Options B and D are less likely.
- **Proficient:** This group understands the concepts well. About 80-90% are expected to choose A (correct). Few would choose C, B, or D due to their good grasp of mathematics.
- **Advanced:** Nearly all (95% or more) would choose A correctly, as they deeply understand the mathematical principles.

## 7: Provide specific predictions
Given the above, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=5% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=5% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
