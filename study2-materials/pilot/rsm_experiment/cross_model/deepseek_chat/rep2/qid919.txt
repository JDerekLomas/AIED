below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%

**Reasoning:**  
The question requires substituting \( x = 0.3 \) into \( y = 3x^2 \). The main pitfalls are:  
1. Misreading \( 3x^2 \) as \( (3x)^2 \) — which would give \( 0.9^2 = 0.81 \) (trap in option A).  
2. Forgetting to square at all — \( 3 \times 0.3 = 0.9 \) not listed, but \( 3 \times 0.3 = 0.9 \) is close to 1.8? No, but \( 6 \times 0.3 = 1.8 \) (option C) might come from incorrectly doubling.  
3. Correct calculation: \( 0.3^2 = 0.09 \), \( 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27 \) (option B).  

For below-basic students, the most attractive wrong answer is A (0.81) because they often think “square 3 and 0.3 together” — a common misconception with coefficients in quadratics. Basic students are split between A and the correct B, with some also picking C from misordered operations. Proficient students mostly avoid A but some still slip. Advanced students overwhelmingly get it right, with only rare slips.  

The question is moderately tricky because the numbers (0.3, squared) are decimals, making mental calculation less automatic, and option A is a strong distractor for the \( (3x)^2 \) error.
