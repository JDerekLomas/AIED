First, let's solve the question correctly:  

\[
\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}.
\]  
So the correct answer is **A**.

---

**Common errors:**  
1. **Adding numerators and denominators without common denominator**:  
   \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \rightarrow \frac{3+4}{2x+x} = \frac{7}{3x}\) → **B** is a tempting error if students add fractions incorrectly (like adding \(\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d}\)).  

2. **Not using common denominator but just adding numerators**:  
   \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \rightarrow \frac{3+4}{x} = \frac{7}{x}\) — not an option here, but similar wrong thinking might lead them to pick D (\(\frac{7}{2x}\)) if they keep denominator \(2x\) but add numerators \(3+4\). This happens if they treat \(\frac{4}{x}\) as having denominator \(2x\) already (without multiplying numerator by 2).  

3. **Finding common denominator \(2x\) correctly but making arithmetic slip**:  
   \(3 + 4 = 7\) (forgetting to multiply 4 by 2) → leads to D (\(\frac{7}{2x}\)).  

4. **Correct common denominator but adding wrong**:  
   \(3 + 8 = 11\) gives A (correct), but some might think \(3 + 4 = 7\) and denominator \(x\) (not \(2x\)) → \(\frac{7}{x}\) not an option, so not chosen.  

---

**Why this question is potentially tricky:**  
- Students might rush and add \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\) by just adding numerators \(3+4=7\) and using \(x\) as denominator → not an option, so they might switch to \(2x\) as denominator → D.  
- The most tempting wrong answer is **B** (\(\frac{7}{3x}\)) if they incorrectly add fractions as if adding ratios.  
- Distractor C (\(\frac{11}{x}\)) could attract those who get numerator right (11) but forget to keep \(2x\) denominator (they incorrectly think \(\frac{4}{x} = \frac{8}{x}\) when doubling for common denominator? No, that’s impossible unless they mess up badly). More likely: They think \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{7}{x}\) — not an option, so C might be chosen if they mistakenly multiply first fraction numerator and denominator wrongly to get \(\frac{3}{x} + \frac{8}{x} = \frac{11}{x}\) (i.e., incorrectly rewrite \(\frac{3}{2x}\) as \(\frac{3}{x}\) and \(\frac{4}{x}\) as \(\frac{8}{x}\) — nonsensical but plausible for very weak students).

**Predictions by ability level:**

**Below basic:** Likely to guess or make fundamental errors like adding denominators. B (\(\frac{7}{3x}\)) is the classic wrong addition of fractions error. Some might pick D from adding 3+4 and keeping 2x.  
- A: 25% (some guess right)  
- B: 40% (common error)  
- C: 20% (random wrong)  
- D: 15%  

**Basic:** Still prone to common denominator slip, but less likely to pick B than below basic.  
- A: 40%  
- B: 25%  
- C: 10%  
- D: 25%  

**Proficient:** Mostly correct but some careless errors (like D).  
- A: 75%  
- B: 5%  
- C: 5%  
- D: 15%  

**Advanced:** Nearly all correct.  
- A: 95%  
- B: 1%  
- C: 1%  
- D: 3%
