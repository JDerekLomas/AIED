below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%  
basic: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%  
proficient: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%  
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.5% D=0%  

**Rationale:**  
This question directly tests the convention that a division bar implies brackets around the entire numerator and entire denominator. The expression \( c \div (h+4) \) has explicit brackets, so the translation to \( \frac{c}{h+4} \) is straightforward.  

- **Below basic** students often misinterpret the order of operations, confusing \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \) (C) or incorrectly distributing the division (B).  
- **Basic** students are more likely to recognise the correct form but a notable minority still choose C (common error: \( c \div h + 4 \)).  
- **Proficient/Advanced** students overwhelmingly get this correct. The explicit brackets in the question make it easier than if it were written as \( c \div h+4 \), which would more strongly trigger the misconception tested by option C.
