Let’s go step-by-step.

**Step 1 – Interpret the question**  
Left side: \( 8 + 12 \div 4 \)  
Right side: \( (8+12) \div 4 \)  

Order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS):  
- Left: Division before addition: \( 12 \div 4 = 3\), then \( 8 + 3 = 11\)  
- Right: Brackets first: \( 8+12 = 20\), then \( 20 \div 4 = 5\)  

So \( 11 > 5 \), so the symbol is \( > \) (Option A).

**Step 2 – Consider likely errors**  
A common error is to ignore order of operations and compute left-to-right:  
\( 8+12 = 20\), \( 20 \div 4 = 5\), then compare \( 5 \) with \( (8+12)\div4 = 5\), so they think \( = \). That would pick C.  

Another possible error is to compute left correctly but miscompute right (e.g., \( (8+12) \div 4 = 8 + 3 = 11\) wrongly) and think they’re equal, but that’s less likely here.  

Option D (\(\geq\)) is a distractor for students who can’t decide between \(>\) or \(=\).  

**Step 3 – Think about difficulty**  
This is a classic order-of-operations trap question, but:  
- The numbers are simple.  
- The left side has no brackets, so students who know division before addition will get 11.  
- The right side has brackets, so students might think “they’ve just added brackets to make it clearer” and not realise it changes the result.  

For weaker students, left-to-right thinking is common, so C is a strong lure.  
For stronger students, they’ll spot the trap immediately.

**Step 4 – Estimate percentages by level**  

**Below basic:** Most will compute left-to-right on left side, get 5, same as right side, so choose C. Some might pick \(>\) if they guess. A few might pick D if uncertain.  
A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%  

**Basic:** Still a significant number will do left-to-right, but more know division first than below basic. Roughly split between A and C.  
A=50% B=5% C=40% D=5%  

**Proficient:** Most know order of operations, so high on A. Some might rush and miscompare, but few.  
A=85% B=3% C=10% D=2%  

**Advanced:** Almost all get it right.  
A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%
