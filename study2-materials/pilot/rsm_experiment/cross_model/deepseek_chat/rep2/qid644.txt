First, let's analyze the question.  
The expression is \((2p - 1)(3p - 4)\).  
The arrows point to \(-1\) and \(-4\), so students are being asked:  
When expanding, what do you get when you multiply the **two constant terms** from each bracket (the terms indicated)?  

That multiplication is \((-1) \times (-4) = +4\).  

But the question is **not** asking for the full expansion—only the result of multiplying those two specific terms.  

Potential pitfalls:  
1. Students might think it’s asking for the **coefficient of \(p\)** term (outer + inner products: \(2p \times -4 = -8p\) and \(-1 \times 3p = -3p\), sum = \(-11p\), but that’s not what’s asked).  
2. Students might incorrectly think a negative × negative = negative.  
3. They might misread which terms are being multiplied (e.g., multiply 1 and 4 and get 4 but forget signs).  
4. They might think the answer is one of the numbers appearing in the brackets but not from multiplication (e.g., -5, maybe from -1 + -4 incorrectly).  

Given the numbers, the most likely wrong answers:  
- **B) -4** (multiplying without considering sign rule, or incorrectly thinking negative × negative = negative)  
- **D) -5** (adding -1 and -4 instead of multiplying)  
- **C) +5** (adding 1 and 4 with wrong sign logic? less likely)  

For ability levels:  

**Below basic** — likely to struggle with negative multiplication, might guess or add instead. Many will pick -5 (adding) or -4 (wrong sign).  
**Basic** — may still make sign error, but many will know to multiply, so split between +4 and -4.  
**Proficient** — know negative × negative = positive, so mostly +4, but some might misread what’s being asked.  
**Advanced** — almost all +4.  

Let’s estimate percentages.

below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=10% D=30%  
basic: A=50% B=30% C=5% D=15%  
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%  
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
