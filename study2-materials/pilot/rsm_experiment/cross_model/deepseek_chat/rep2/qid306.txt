**Analysis of the question:**

- **Problem P**: \(4-5+6\). This is a straightforward left-to-right calculation (same precedence). The common misconception is to think addition should be done before subtraction, i.e., doing \(5+6\) first. But here, subtraction and addition have equal precedence.  
- **Problem Q**: \(4+5\times6\). This tests BIDMAS/BODMAS: multiplication before addition. The trap is to do \(4+5\) first.  

Option B is correct: P: \(4-5\) first (left-to-right), Q: \(5\times6\) first (multiplication before addition).

**Likely student thinking:**

- **Below Basic**: Likely to choose by superficial pattern matching or guess. Many might pick C (do addition first in both) because they remember “add before subtract” incorrectly, and also add before multiply. D could attract some because they see the \(+6\) and \(\times6\) as “second operation” in both.  
- **Basic**: Some awareness of BIDMAS, but may still conflate addition/subtraction order. Might lean towards A (doing leftmost first in both) or B (correct for Q but also correct for P by coincidence — but they might not fully understand why P is left-to-right).  
- **Proficient**: Knows BIDMAS well. Should realize P is left-to-right, Q is multiplication first. Most will choose B. Some may slip to D if they mistakenly think P requires adding 5+6 first (misconception lingering).  
- **Advanced**: Nearly all get B.
