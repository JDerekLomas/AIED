Let's analyze the question step by step.

**Question:**  
\( T = k^4 \)  
What is \( T \) when \( k = -3 \)?  

We compute \( (-3)^4 = (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \).  
First pair: \( (-3)^2 = 9 \)  
Then \( 9 \times (-3) = -27 \)  
Then \( -27 \times (-3) = 81 \).  

So \( T = 81 \).  

**Common errors:**  
- Mistaking \( (-3)^4 \) for \( -3^4 \). If it were \( -3^4 \), that's \( -(3^4) = -81 \), but here the parentheses make it clear the negative is raised to the 4th power.  
- Some might multiply incorrectly: \( -3 \times 4 = -12 \) (option D) — that’s mixing up exponentiation with multiplication.  
- Some might think odd number of negatives remains negative: \( (-3)^3 = -27 \), but here it’s even exponent → positive.  

**Answer choices:**  
A) \( 81 \) — correct  
B) \( 12 \) — possible if they do \( (-3) \times (-4) \)?? Actually not logical. Possibly they computed \( (-3)^2 = 9 \) then added 3 more? But 12 seems random — maybe from \( (-3) \times 4 \)?  
C) \( -81 \) — sign error: confusing \( (-3)^4 \) with \( -(3^4) \)  
D) \( -12 \) — mixing up \( k^4 \) with \( 4k \) when \( k=-3 \)

**Predicting student responses by ability level:**

**Below basic:** Likely not comfortable with exponents, may confuse exponent with multiplication by 4 → D (-12) will be common. Also some might think odd/even negative rule wrong and choose C (-81). Only a small proportion will get correct 81.  

**Basic:** Still significant confusion with negative bases in exponents. Many pick C (-81) because they think "negative to an even power is negative" (misremembering) or they compute \( -(3^4) \). Also some pick D (-12). Correct choice A ~ 40–50%.

**Proficient:** Understand exponent rules. Should mostly get A correct. Still some might rush and misread as \( -(3^4) \) → C, but much less likely.  

**Advanced:** Almost all get correct.
