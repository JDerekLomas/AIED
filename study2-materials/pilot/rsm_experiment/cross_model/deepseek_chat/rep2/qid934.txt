below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=30% D=10%  
basic: A=10% B=40% C=40% D=10%  
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%  
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%  

**Explanation:**  
The equation is \(4x + 2y = 10\). When \(x = 0\), we have \(4(0) + 2y = 10 \Rightarrow 2y = 10 \Rightarrow y = 5\).  

- **Below basic** students are likely to guess randomly among the plausible numbers, possibly attracted to 20 (if they multiply 4×0 and 2×10 incorrectly) or 3/2.5 as mis-remembered arithmetic results.  
- **Basic** students may still confuse which variable is which in the table, or make arithmetic slips, but many will find \(y=5\). Some might incorrectly substitute \(y=4\) into \(4x\) instead of \(x=4\) row.  
- **Proficient** students will mostly get \(y=5\), with a few careless errors in solving \(2y=10\).  
- **Advanced** students will all solve correctly; no trap exists here because the substitution is straightforward and the equation is in a simple integer form.  

The question is relatively easy because it asks for \(y\) when \(x=0\), avoiding the need to manipulate both variables simultaneously or deal with fractions at this stage.
