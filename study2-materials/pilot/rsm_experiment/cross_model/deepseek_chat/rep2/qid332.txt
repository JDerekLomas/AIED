Let’s break this down.  

We have \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\).

**Tom’s step**:  
Add 5 to both sides → \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\).  
That’s correct.

**Katie’s step**:  
She seems to have multiplied through by 3, but incorrectly:  
If she did \(3 \times \left( \frac{x}{3} - 5 \right) = 3 \times 12\), the left would be \(x - 15\), not \(x - 5\).  
So \(x - 5 = 36\) is wrong unless she only multiplied the \(\frac{x}{3}\) term by 3 and the \(-5\) by something else incorrectly (common mistake: not multiplying every term by 3).  

Thus **only Tom** is correct.

**Why students might get it wrong**:  
- Below Basic: Might not spot Katie’s error; may think multiplying through by 3 at the start is fine, or may be confused about order of operations. Some might misremember that you can’t add 5 before multiplying, so they might choose B or C.  
- Basic: Many will know to add 5 first, but some may think Katie’s move is also valid (common fraction equation mistake).  
- Proficient: Likely to spot the distributive law error.  
- Advanced: Will immediately see the mistake in Katie’s step.

**Estimated percentages**:

**Below Basic**:  
A (Only Tom) – only about 40% because many will think Katie’s move is valid (they often forget to multiply all terms), so C (Both) gets a large share. Some may choose B if they incorrectly think you must multiply first.  

**Basic**:  
A – about 60%, C – 30%, others small. Still a significant fraction think both could be valid next steps.

**Proficient**:  
A – 90%, C – 5%, others 5%. Most spot the error in Katie’s step.

**Advanced**:  
A – 98%, others 2% (careless misreading only).
