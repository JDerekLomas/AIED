First, let’s solve the equation correctly:

\[
3p = \frac{1}{12}
\]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[
p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}
\]

So the correct answer is **B**.

**Analysis of the question difficulty and likely errors:**

1. **A) \( p = \frac14 \)**:  
   This could be chosen if a student incorrectly multiplies both sides by 3 instead of dividing, or if they misread \(3p\) as \(p/3\). Alternatively, if they think “3 times what is 1/12?” and mistakenly invert 12 to 4 without dividing by 3.  
   Or, some might do \( \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} = \frac14\) — a common “operational reversal” error.

2. **B) \( p = \frac{1}{36} \)**:  
   Correct answer.

3. **C) \( p = 4 \)**:  
   This could come from flipping numerator and denominator: \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) → \(p = 12/3 = 4\) (ignoring the fraction inversion, or misinterpreting division). Alternatively, doing \(p = \frac{12}{1} \times 3\) wrongly.

4. **D) \( p = \frac19 \)**:  
   Less obviously wrong, but could come from \( \frac{1}{12} \times 4 \) due to misremembering something like “divide by 3” → multiply by 1/3, but then miscalculate \(1/12 \times 1/3 = 1/36\) as \(1/(12/3) = 1/4\)? Wait, not 1/9. Actually 1/9 might come from \(3p = 1/12\) → \(p = (1/12) / 3\) but then incorrectly simplify \(12/3 = 4\) → \(1/4\)? That’s not 1/9.  
   Possibly 1/9 comes from solving \(3p = 1/3\) instead of 1/12 — misreading the 12 as a 3, then \(p = 1/9\). Or maybe they think 1/12 ÷ 3 = 1/(12×3) but then wrongly add 12+3=15, no… not 1/9. But 1/9 = 4/36, not obviously linked. Could be a random guess or mis-simplification of 3/27 or similar. Possibly they mistakenly think \(p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}\) but then multiply numerator and denominator wrongly: (1×1)/(12×3) = 1/36 correct, but if they did 1/(12×3) = 1/36. So maybe 1/9 is just a distractor for those who can’t multiply fractions. Or maybe they see 1/12 ÷ 3 = 1/(12/3) = 1/4? That’s A. So D might be a rare choice.

**Likelihood by ability group:**

- **Below basic**:  
  They might often reverse the operation — multiply instead of divide → choose A. Some random guesses among others, but B will still get a decent chunk because it’s a simple one-step division.  
  Distribution guess: A=40% (common reversal), B=30% (correct), C=20% (wild inversion), D=10% (rare mis-simplification).

- **Basic**:  
  Still a significant reversal error (A), but more choosing B correctly.  
  A=25%, B=50%, C=15%, D=10%.

- **Proficient**:  
  Most will get B, but a few might slip into A due to rushing.  
  A=10%, B=85%, C=3%, D=2%.

- **Advanced**:  
  Virtually all correct.  
  A=1%, B=98%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

**Final estimates**:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%  
basic: A=25% B=50% C=15% D=10%
