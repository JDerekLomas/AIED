below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%  
basic: A=10% B=50% C=30% D=10%  
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%  
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%

**Rationale:**  
The equation \(10 = \frac{5}{p}\) requires solving \(10p = 5\), so \(p = 0.5\). However, many students will mistakenly multiply both sides by 5 instead of \(p\) (giving \(50 = \frac{1}{p}\) or similar) or will think of the reciprocal relationship incorrectly (“10 times bigger, so \(p\) must be 10 times smaller” – but incorrectly apply it as \(p = 50\)).  

- **Below basic:** Likely to guess or confuse multiplication/division. Many pick B (50) from incorrectly doing \(10 \times 5\).  
- **Basic:** Still a high error rate for B (50), as the operation “divide 5 by 10” is not automatic; some may pick C (2) from reversing numbers.  
- **Proficient:** Most solve correctly (0.5), but a few may rush and pick C (2) from \(10/5\) instead of \(5/10\).  
- **Advanced:** Almost all correct; tiny errors from misreading.  

The question looks simple but catches errors in rearranging simple algebraic fractions, especially with the variable in the denominator. Option B is the most attractive distractor.
