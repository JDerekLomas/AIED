First, let's solve the question correctly:  

\[
2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5} = (2 + 1) + \left( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} \right) = 3 + \frac{3}{5} = 3 \frac{3}{5}
\]  
So the correct answer is **A**.

---

**Why other options might be chosen:**  
- **B** \( \frac{18}{5} \) – This is the improper fraction equivalent of \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \), but the question says "Leave your answer as a mixed number", so while mathematically correct, it doesn’t match the instruction. Some students might convert to improper fraction first (e.g., \( \frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5} \)) and forget to convert back.  
- **C** \( \frac{18}{10} \) – Likely from incorrectly adding denominators: \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} \) wrongly done as \( \frac{1+2}{5+5} = \frac{3}{10} \) (common denominator error), then adding whole numbers 2+1=3 and combining as \( 3 \frac{3}{10} \) but then converting to improper fraction incorrectly? Actually, \( 3 \frac{3}{10} = \frac{33}{10} \), not \( \frac{18}{10} \), so \( \frac{18}{10} \) might come from \( \frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} \) but wrongly adding denominators to get \( \frac{11+7}{5+5} = \frac{18}{10} \). This is a clear "add the denominators" mistake.  
- **D** \( 3 \frac{3}{10} \) – This is the mixed number form of the error described for C: \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{10} \) (denominator addition error), then whole numbers added correctly.

**Difficulty assessment:**  
This is a straightforward addition of mixed numbers with **like denominators**, which should be easy for most students who know basic fraction addition.  
Main traps:  
1. Adding denominators (common lower-ability error) → leads to C or D.  
2. Leaving answer as improper fraction (misreading instruction) → leads to B.  
Because numbers are simple and denominators already the same, stronger students should have no trouble.

**Predicted percentages:**

**Below basic:** Likely to add denominators (C or D), with some picking the correct A.  

- A = 40% (some will get it right)  
- B = 10% (some convert to improper and stop)  
- C = 25% (improper fraction form of denominator error)  
- D = 25% (mixed number form of denominator error)  

**Basic:** Less likely to make denominator error, but might leave as improper fraction.  

- A = 70%  
- B = 20%  
- C = 5%  
- D = 5%  

**Proficient:** Mostly correct, some may pick B by not reading "as a mixed number" carefully.  

- A = 85%  
- B = 12%  
- C = 1%  
- D = 2%  

**Advanced:** Almost all correct; any wrong answer likely due to misreading instructions (B).  

- A = 95%  
- B = 5%  
- C = 0%  
- D = 0%
