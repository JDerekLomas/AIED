Let’s break this down.  

We are adding \( 2 \frac{7}{10} + 2 \frac{1}{4} \).  

---

**Step-by-step correct method:**  
1. Add whole numbers: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)  
2. Add fractions: \( \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} \)  
   Common denominator = 20: \( \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20} \)  
3. Combined: \( 4 + \frac{19}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20} \)  

So the correct answer is **B**.  

---

**Distractors:**  
- **A \( \frac{99}{20} \)**: This is \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \) converted to an improper fraction. But the question says “leave your answer as a mixed number,” so A is not in the correct form.  
- **C \( \frac{99}{40} \)**: This would come from adding \( \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} \) incorrectly — maybe using \( 2 \frac{7}{10} = \frac{27}{10} \) and \( 2 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \) then adding without changing denominator properly (27/10 = 54/20, 9/4 = 45/20, sum = 99/20, not 99/40). 99/40 would come if they multiplied denominators 10×4=40 but didn’t adjust numerators correctly (27/10 = 108/40, 9/4 = 90/40, sum = 198/40 = 99/20 — wait, that’s actually correct if done right — so maybe they did 27/10 + 9/4 and just did 27+9=36, 10+4=14 first?? No, 36/14 reduces to 18/7, not 99/40. So C might be from messing up LCM and cross-multiplying wrongly).  
Actually: Let’s check common error: convert to improper: \( \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} \),  
Wrong method: cross add numerators and denominators: \( \frac{27+9}{10+4} = \frac{36}{14} \) not 99/40. So C is maybe random or from using denominator 40 and adding numerators wrong: 27/10=108/40, 9/4=90/40, but 108+90=198/40=99/20 (which is A). So C is just a different wrong fraction.

Actually, maybe C comes if they do \( 2.7 + 2.25 = 4.95 \) then 4.95 = 495/100 = 99/20 (which is A) not 99/40. So C is just a distractor with wrong denominator.

- **D \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \)**: This comes from adding the fractions incorrectly by just adding numerators and denominators: \( \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7+1}{10+4} = \frac{8}{14} \) (common error of adding across without common denominator), then adding whole numbers 4.

**Likelihood of errors by ability:**  

**Below Basic**  
- Likely to add whole numbers correctly (2+2=4).  
- Might add fractions incorrectly using “add across” → get 8/14 → D.  
- Or might convert to improper fractions but add wrongly → possibly C or A (if they forget “mixed number” instruction).  
- Some may pick C if they completely mess up denominator.  
Given D is the “add across” error, that’s a classic mistake for below basic.  

Predict:  
A (improper but numerically correct) – 20% (they might compute correctly but ignore “mixed number”)  
B (correct) – 30%  
C (random wrong fraction) – 20%  
D (add across) – 30%  

---

**Basic**  
- More likely to find common denominator properly but may slip.  
- Some still fall for “add across” for fractions (D) but fewer.  
- Might choose A if they convert to improper then stop.  

Predict:  
A – 25%  
B – 50%  
C – 10%  
D – 15%  

---

**Proficient**  
- Knows to find common denominator.  
- Might still pick A occasionally by oversight of “mixed number” requirement, but most will convert to mixed.  
- Rarely
