Let’s break this down.

**Step 1 – Correct expansion:**  
\[
(m-5)(m-7) = m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35
\]  
So the correct answer is **B**.

**Step 2 – Distractor analysis:**  
- **A** \( m^2 - 2m - 35 \) → This happens if you add the numbers incorrectly:  
  Signs: \((m-5)(m-7) = m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\) but mistakenly: \(-7m - 5m = -2m\) (wrong arithmetic), and then also mess up the constant: \(+35\) is correct, but maybe they forgot \( (-5)(-7) = +35 \) and instead thought \( -5 \times -7 = -35 \) **but** that would give \(-35\) not \(+35\). Wait, no — actually \( -5 \times -7 = +35 \).  
  For A to be \(-35\) constant, they must have done \( (-5) \times (-7) = -35 \) (sign error) and also \(-7m -5m = -2m\) (basic arithmetic slip). So A is a double error: sign error on constant *and* m-coefficient arithmetic error.  

- **C** \( m^2 + 12m + 35 \) → This happens if you treat both signs as negative but then add the m-terms incorrectly with a sign mistake:  
  Actually: \(-7m - 5m = -12m\), but they might have done \(+7m + 5m = +12m\) (by ignoring the minus signs in brackets). Also constant \(+35\) correct. So C = wrong sign on middle term.  

- **D** \( m^2 - 12m - 35 \) → This happens if you get the m-term right but make the constant sign error: \( (-5) \times (-7) = -35 \) (thinking negative × negative = negative). Common sign misconception.  

**Step 3 – Relative difficulty and common errors:**  
- The main trap is **D**, because students often think “minus times minus = minus” for the constant term.  
- **A** is less likely as it involves two arithmetic errors at once (though weak students might guess it).  
- **C** is for students who ignore the minus signs in the brackets when combining like terms.  

**Step 4 – Likelihood by ability group:**  

**Below Basic**:  
- Struggle with negative × negative = positive. Many will pick D.  
- Some will pick A if they mess up both operations.  
- Few will pick C, but possible if they misread brackets entirely.  
- Guessing distribution: D most common wrong answer, then A/C, B correct only by a small fraction.  

**Basic**:  
- Still high error rate on sign of constant, so D is common.  
- Some might make C error (signs on m-term wrong).  
- Many will get m-term right but constant wrong, so D > C > A.  
- More than below basic will get B right.  

**Proficient**:  
- Majority get B right.  
- Main residual error is D (sign of constant).  
- Some might pick A if rushing arithmetic but unlikely.  
- Small percentage pick C.  

**Advanced**:  
- Almost all get B.  
- Errors are rare and likely just misreading, so wrong answers equally distributed among A, C, D but very low %.

**Final estimates:**

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=20% D=40%  
basic: A=10% B=50% C=10% D=30%  
proficient: A=2% B=85% C=3% D=10%  
advanced: A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%
