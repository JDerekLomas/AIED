Let’s break this down step-by-step.  

We have:  
\[
-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1
\]  
We can solve:  
\[
\star = \frac{-1}{-\frac{3}{4}} 
\]  
Dividing by a negative fraction:  
\[
\star = \frac{-1}{-\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{-1 \times (-\frac{4}{3})}{1} = \frac{4}{3}
\]  

So the correct answer is \( \frac{4}{3} \) (Option A).

### Key traps students might fall into:
1. **Sign errors**:  
   They might think \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1 \) means \(\star\) must be negative because there’s already a minus sign on the left, forgetting that the product of two negatives is positive. This could lead to choosing \(-\frac{4}{3}\) (B).  

2. **Reciprocal without sign consideration**:  
   Some might take the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \) but keep the negative from the original fraction incorrectly, picking \(-\frac{4}{3}\) (B) instead of \( \frac{4}{3} \) (A).  

3. **Confusing multiplication identity**:  
   If they think “\(-\frac{3}{4}\) times what equals \(-1\)” and wrongly solve as \(-\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{3}{4} = \text{something positive} \), they might pick D.  

4. **Reciprocal of \(-\frac{3}{4}\) is \(-\frac{4}{3}\)** — they might think that’s the answer (B) without checking the product sign:  
   \( -\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{4}{3} = +1 \), not \(-1\).  
   So they’d realize B gives \(+1\), not \(-1\), if they check — but many won’t check.

### Ability-level reasoning:
- **Below basic**: Likely high error rate; may guess reciprocals but often miss sign. Many might pick B because it’s the reciprocal of the given fraction including the negative sign. Some might pick C or D from random confusion.  

- **Basic**: Might still pick B often, but some will check multiplication crudely and realize answer must be positive because negative × negative = positive, so A is correct.  

- **Proficient**: Mostly correct (A), but some proficient students might rush and pick B if they automatically take reciprocal with the same sign.  

- **Advanced**: Almost all correct (A); know to solve algebraically and check.

### Estimated percentages:

**below_basic**:  
- A = 30% (some get it by correct reciprocal ignoring sign)  
- B = 50% (the tempting sign-preserved reciprocal)  
- C = 10% (confuse with original fraction positive)  
- D = 10% (confuse with original fraction negative)  

**basic**:  
- A = 60%  
- B = 30%  
- C = 5%  
- D = 5%  

**proficient**:  
- A = 85%  
- B = 10%  
- C = 3%  
- D = 2%  

**advanced**:  
- A = 97%  
- B = 2%  
- C = 0.5%  
- D = 0.5%
