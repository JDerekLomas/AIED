First, analyze the question:  
\[
3 - 5 + 4 \times 2
\]  
Order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) says multiplication before addition/subtraction:  
\[
4 \times 2 = 8
\]  
Then left-to-right for addition/subtraction:  
\[
3 - 5 = -2, \quad -2 + 8 = 6
\]  
Correct answer: A) 6.

Common errors:  
1. Doing operations strictly left-to-right ignoring multiplication first:  
\( 3 - 5 = -2, \quad -2 + 4 = 2, \quad 2 \times 2 = 4 \) → B) 4.  
2. Misinterpreting signs: \( 3 - (5 + 4 \times 2) \) = \( 3 - (5 + 8) = 3 - 13 = -10 \) → D) -10 (if they think the whole expression after minus is grouped).  
3. More extreme error: \( 3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 = 3 - 9 \times 2 \) but if they do addition first then multiply wrong: \( 3 - 18 = -15 \) not an option, but if they did \( (3 - 5 + 4) \times 2 = 2 \times 2 = 4 \) (left-to-right ignoring precedence completely) → B again.  
C) -12 is less likely but could come from \( 3 - 5 + 8 \) mistaken as \( 3 - (5+8) \) then miscalculated as \( 3 - 15 = -12 \).  

Given typical UK classroom experience:  
- **Below basic** students often ignore multiplication first or misapply signs; B (left-to-right) will be common, some will pick D if they incorrectly group after minus.  
- **Basic** students still often make left-to-right mistake, but fewer pick D.  
- **Proficient** know order but may rush and misread signs occasionally.  
- **Advanced** nearly all get correct.

Estimated percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=50% C=5% D=15%  
basic: A=60% B=30% C=2% D=8%  
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%  
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
