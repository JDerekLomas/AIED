Let’s break it down step-by-step.

---

**Step 1: Understanding the problem**  
The equation is:  

\[
\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12
\]

Tom’s step:  
Add \(5\) to both sides → \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This is correct.

Katie’s step:  
She seems to multiply through by \(3\) but incorrectly:  
If she did \(3 \times \left( \frac{x}{3} - 5 \right) = 3 \times 12\), she should get \(x - 15 = 36\).  
She wrote \(x - 5 = 36\), which means she only multiplied the \(\frac{x}{3}\) term by 3, not the \(-5\) by 3. That’s incorrect (common error: not distributing multiplication over subtraction properly).

So only Tom is correct → Answer is **A**.

**Step 2: What makes this question easy/hard?**  
- Looks like it’s about solving linear equations, but it’s really about spotting a **distributive law** error in Katie’s step.
- Katie’s step mimics the common mistake of “multiplying both sides but only applying to the term with \(x\)” — students who rush might think she just “cleared the fraction” and believe she’s correct.
- Tom’s step is very obvious — adding 5 is simple and not error-prone.
- Therefore, the difficulty is in noticing the incorrect distribution in Katie’s step.
- If students choose C (“Both”), it’s because they think Katie just multiplied the whole equation by 3 correctly, not noticing the missing multiplication of the 5.

**Step 3: Predicted percentages by ability level**

**Below basic**:  
Likely to struggle with both steps. Many might not know to add 5 first, so may incorrectly think Tom is wrong. Some might think Katie’s step is valid because they don’t distribute correctly themselves. I’d expect a spread but with “Both” being popular due to not spotting Katie’s mistake.  
- A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%

**Basic**:  
Will mostly get Tom’s step right, but a significant portion will miss Katie’s error. Many think “multiply both sides by 3” works without checking carefully.  
- A=40% B=5% C=50% D=5%

**Proficient**:  
Most will spot the mistake in Katie’s step because they’re more careful with distribution. High proportion pick A.  
- A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%

**Advanced**:  
Will almost all see Katie’s error instantly. Very high accuracy.  
- A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%

**Final answer:**

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=5% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
