Let’s break this down step-by-step.

**1. Understanding the problem**  
The brackets are \((2p - 1)(3p - 4)\).  
The arrows point to \(-1\) (from first bracket) and \(-4\) (from second bracket).  
The question asks: “What should she get when she multiplies the two terms indicated by the arrows?”  

That means: \( (-1) \times (-4) = +4\).

**2. What might trip students up**  
- **Sign rules**: Some students might incorrectly think “minus times minus = minus” → would pick \(-4\).  
- **Distraction by other terms**: The question is only about multiplying the two specific terms. Some might try to do the whole expansion in their head and pick an incorrect intermediate.  
- **Option C (+5) and D (-5)** might come from adding \(-1\) and \(-4\) (getting \(-5\)), or incorrectly combining signs and numbers from elsewhere in the expansion.  
- The question is **purely about integer multiplication with negatives** but framed in an algebra expansion context — this may mislead weaker students into overcomplicating.

**3. Likely answer distribution by ability**  

**Below basic**  
Likely to struggle with negative × negative. Many may think \(-1 \times -4 = -4\). Others may add instead of multiply (getting \(-5\)). Some might guess \(+4\) correctly.  
Estimate: A=40% (correct), B=40% (sign error), C=5%, D=15% (adding).

**Basic**  
Better with integers, but still some sign errors. Fewer adding errors.  
Estimate: A=65% (correct), B=30% (sign error), C=2%, D=3%.

**Proficient**  
Most will get the correct sign, though a small fraction may slip due to misreading the question (e.g., multiply \(2p\) and \(-4\) instead of the arrowed terms).  
Estimate: A=90%, B=8%, C=1%, D=1%.

**Advanced**  
Almost all correct.  
Estimate: A=99%, B=1%, C=0%, D=0%.
