Alright, let’s break this down.  

We have:  

\[
3p = \frac{1}{12}
\]  

Divide both sides by 3:  
\[
p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}
\]  

So the correct answer is **B**.

**Distractor analysis:**  

- **A) \( p = \frac14 \)** – This would come from incorrectly thinking \( 3p = \frac{1}{12} \) means \( p = \frac{1}{12 \div 3} \) but misreading as \( p = \frac{1}{12} \times 3 \) → \( p = \frac{3}{12} = \frac14 \). Very common error: multiplying by 3 instead of dividing by 3.  
- **C) \( p = 4 \)** – Might come from \( 3p = \frac{1}{12} \) → \( p = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} \) wrongly done as \( p = 12 \div 3 \) if someone misreads \( \frac{1}{12} \) as 12. Less likely, but some very weak students might flip fraction incorrectly.  
- **D) \( p = \frac19 \)** – Could arise from \( p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 \) incorrectly as \( \frac{1}{12 \div 3} = \frac14 \) but then some other miscalculation; or maybe from \( \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} = \frac14 \) but then thought \( \frac14 = \frac{1}{9} \) (unlikely). Possibly random guess.

**Difficulty assessment:**  
This is very straightforward for proficient and advanced students — just one-step division of a fraction by an integer.  
But for below basic students, the **A** distractor is very tempting because they often multiply by the coefficient instead of dividing, especially with fractions.

**Predicted percentages:**

**Below basic** – Many will pick A due to multiplying by 3 (common error). Some random guesses among others.  
- A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%  

**Basic** – Still a noticeable error for A, but more will get B correct.  
- A=30% B=55% C=10% D=5%  

**Proficient** – Almost all get B correct, small slips possible.  
- A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%  

**Advanced** – Virtually all correct.  
- A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%
