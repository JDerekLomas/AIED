**Reasoning**  
This question tests solving a simple equation of the form \( a = \frac{b}{p} \).  
The main trap is option B (\(p=50\)), which a student might choose if they incorrectly multiply \(10 \times 5\) instead of solving \(10p = 5 \Rightarrow p = 0.5\).  

- **Below basic**: Many will guess or misapply multiplication, so B (the "big number") is tempting. Some may pick A from seeing \(5/10 = 0.5\) but reversing the operation.  
- **Basic**: Still a significant error rate for B, but more will solve correctly for C.  
- **Proficient**: Most solve correctly (C), but a few may still rush to B or consider D if they think \(p\) cannot be in the denominator.  
- **Advanced**: Almost all choose C; rare careless slips or overthinking may account for other choices.  

The question is straightforward mathematically, but the presence of 0.5 and 50 as options catches those who confuse the operation.
