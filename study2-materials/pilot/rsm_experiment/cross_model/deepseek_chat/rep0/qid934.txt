Alright, let’s break this down.

We have the equation:  
\[
4x + 2y = 10
\]  
The table shows:  
\[
x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
\]  
and for \( x = 0 \), \( y \) is the ★ we need to find.  

**Step 1 — Solve for ★**  
Substitute \( x = 0 \) into \( 4x + 2y = 10 \):  
\[
4(0) + 2y = 10 \implies 2y = 10 \implies y = 5
\]  
So the correct answer is **C) 5**.

**Step 2 — Common errors**  
1. **Misunderstanding the table** — Some might think the table is asking for something else, like the value of \(4x\) or \(2y\) separately.  
2. **Arithmetic slip** — Might solve \( 4x + 2y = 10 \) incorrectly for \(x=0\) as \( 0 + 2y = 10 \to y=5 \), but maybe divide wrong: \( 10/4 = 2.5 \) (D) if they mistakenly think \(4x + 2y = 10\) with \(x=0\) means \(4x=10\)? That’s not possible, but maybe they misread as \(4x=10\)? Actually, not likely here.  
3. **Answer A) 20** — Could come from plugging \(x=0\) into \(4x\) only and ignoring the rest, or from miscalculating \(4x+2y\) as \(4*0+2*10=20\)? That’s random. Maybe they think \(y\) is \(10*2\)? Unlikely. More likely: they think \(4x+2y=10\) means substitute \(x=0\) gives \(2y=10\), then multiply 10 by 2 = 20 by misreading the equation as \(4x+2y\) equals something else.  
4. **B) 3** — Could come from solving \(4(0)+2y=6\) (misreading 10 as 6) or just guessing.  
5. **D) 2.5** — Could come from solving \(4x+2y=10\) for \(y\) in general as \(y = (10-4x)/2\), but for \(x=0\) that’s 5, not 2.5. Wait, maybe they mistakenly solve \(4x+2y=10\) as \(2y=10/4\)?? That would be 2.5 — yes, if they do \(4x+2y=10\) → divide all by 2 incorrectly? No: divide by 2: \(2x+y=5\) for \(x=0\) gives \(y=5\). So 2.5 could come from solving \(4x+2y=10\) for \(y\) but using \(x=4\) by mistake? Actually if \(x=4\), \(16+2y=10\) → \(2y=-6\) → \(y=-3\), not 2.5. So maybe they think \(y = 10/4 = 2.5\) because they think \(4x+2y=10\) with \(x=0\) means \(4*0+2y\) → \(4+2y=10\) (adding 4 wrongly) → \(2y=6\) → \(y=3\)? That’s B. So D likely comes from a simple wrong operation: \(4x+2y=10\), forget 2y, think 4x=10, so x=2.5, then wrongly put that as y? Or maybe they rearranged wrongly: \(y = 10/4\) if they miswrite equation as \(4y=10\).

**Step 3 — Difficulty & traps**  
This question is **straightforward** for anyone who can substitute into a linear equation. But for low-attaining students:  
- Misreading the table (thinking star is for x=4 or another value)  
- Arithmetic errors in solving \(2y=10\)  
- Distractor D (2.5) is plausible if they divide 10 by 4 (mixing up operations)  
- Distractor A (20) might be chosen if they double 10 thinking y = 2×10.  

Given it’s a simple substitution, most proficient/advanced students will get C) 5 immediately. Below basic will spread errors mainly between C, D, B.

**Below basic**: Many will guess or miscompute. D (2.5
