Let's break down the question first.  

We have \(10x - 6y = 30\) and a table:

| \( x \) | \( \bigstar \) |
| \( y \) | \( 0.5 \)      |

This means when \( y = 0.5 \), \( x = \bigstar \).  

Substitute \( y = 0.5 \):  
\[
10x - 6(0.5) = 30
\]
\[
10x - 3 = 30
\]
\[
10x = 33
\]
\[
x = 3.3
\]

So correct answer is **C) 3.3**.  

**Potential errors:**  
1. **Mistaking the table layout** — some might think \( x = 0.5 \) and solve for \( y \), which gives \( y = -\frac{25}{6} \approx -4.166... \) which is close to -4.25 (option B). This is the main trap.  
2. **Arithmetic slip** — e.g., \(10x - 3 = 30 \to 10x = 27 \to x = 2.7\) (option D).  
3. **Sign error** — solving \(10x + 3 = 30\) (if they mistakenly do \(-6 \times 0.5 = -3\) but then add incorrectly in equation) could lead to \(x = 2.7\) or another option.  

Given the proximity of wrong answers to plausible mistakes, this is a moderately tricky question for lower ability students.

**Predictions:**  

**Below basic:** Likely confused by table layout, many will swap x and y.  
- A) 4.25 — possible if they guess or miscalculate sign after swapping.  
- **B) -4.25** — most common wrong answer (swap x and y).  
- **C) 3.3** — correct, but only those careful will get it.  
- D) 2.7 — arithmetic slip.  

**Basic:** Still high error rate due to layout trap, but some will solve correctly.  
**Proficient:** Most will solve correctly; some arithmetic slips.  
**Advanced:** Nearly all correct.
