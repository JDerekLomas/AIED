Alright, let’s work through this step by step as a teacher would.

**Step 1 – What’s being asked?**  
The equation is \( y = 3x^2 \), with \( x = 0.3 \).  
So \( y = 3 \times (0.3)^2 \).  
First calculate \( 0.3^2 = 0.09 \).  
Then \( 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27 \).  
So the correct answer is **B) 0.27**.

---

**Step 2 – Possible misconceptions**  
- **Squaring error**: Some may think \( 0.3^2 = 0.6 \) or \( 0.9 \), then multiply by 3 to get 1.8 or 2.7 (options C and D).  
- **Forgetting to square**: Might think \( y = 3 \times 0.3 = 0.9 \) — but 0.9 isn’t an option, so that’s not a distractor here.  
- **Order of operations**: Doing \( (3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81 \) (option A) — a very common trap! That would mean misreading \( 3x^2 \) as \( (3x)^2 \).

Here, **A) 0.81** is a strong distractor because students often think: "3 times 0.3 is 0.9, square it → 0.81". That’s the main likely error.

---

**Step 3 – Difficulty of this specific question**  
The numbers are decimals, not whole numbers, so mental arithmetic is slightly trickier. But the main trap is purely the misinterpretation \( (3x)^2 \) vs \( 3x^2 \).  
This is a classic misconception question, not just a routine calculation.  

We must predict how each ability group will respond.

**Step 4 – Predictions by ability group**

- **Below basic**: Likely to confuse order of operations strongly. Many will pick A (0.81). Some might pick C or D from mis-squaring 0.3 as 0.6 or 0.9 and multiplying by 3.  
  I’d guess: **A ~50%**, B ~20%, C ~15%, D ~15%.

- **Basic**: Some will still fall into the A trap, but more will get B than below basic.  
  Maybe: A ~35%, B ~40%, C ~15%, D ~10%.

- **Proficient**: Mostly get B, but a few still slip to A.  
  Possibly: A ~15%, B ~75%, C ~5%, D ~5%.

- **Advanced**: Almost all get B; rare slips to A or others.  
  A ~5%, B ~90%, C ~3%, D ~2%.

**Step 5 – Final percentages**

below_basic: A=50% B=20% C=15% D=15%  
basic: A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%  
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%  
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
