First, I’ll analyze the question:  

We have \( T = k^4 \), with \( k = -3 \).  
\( (-3)^4 = (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81 \).  
So correct answer is **A) 81**.  

Potential misconceptions:  
1. Multiplying a negative number an even number of times yields a positive result — some students forget this and pick C) -81.  
2. Misinterpreting exponent notation \( k^4 \) as \( k \times 4 \) (linear scaling) would give \( -12 \) (D).  
3. Some might compute \( 3^4 = 81 \) but incorrectly keep the sign from \( k = -3 \) if they think odd/even rule is reversed.  
4. Others might compute \( (-3) \times 4 = -12 \) and pick D, or might compute \( (-3)^3 = -81 \) by mistake if they miscount exponent.  

This question is relatively straightforward for those comfortable with exponents, but since the base is negative, it tests sign rules explicitly. Many students know \( (-2)^2 = 4 \) but higher even powers with negatives sometimes trigger errors.

**Predictions by ability level:**

- **Below basic**: Likely to confuse exponent with multiplication by 4 → pick D (-12). Others may guess B (12) from \( 3 \times 4 \), or C (-81) from sign error. Only some will compute correctly.  
  - A=25% B=15% C=40% D=20%

- **Basic**: Some will know even power → positive, but may miscalculate as \( -81 \) from \( -(3^4) \) misconception. Strong tendency for C.  
  - A=45% B=10% C=35% D=10%

- **Proficient**: Mostly correct, but a few slip to C due to misinterpreting \( (-3)^4 \) as \( -3^4 \) (order of operations mistake).  
  - A=85% B=5% C=8% D=2%

- **Advanced**: Almost all correct.  
  - A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
