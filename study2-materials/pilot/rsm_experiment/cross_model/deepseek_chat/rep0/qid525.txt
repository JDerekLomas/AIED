First, I’ll solve it correctly:  

\( 2\frac{7}{10} + 2\frac{1}{4} \)  

= \( \frac{20}{10} + \frac{7}{10} + \frac{8}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \) but more straightforward:  

= \( (2+2) + \left( \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} \right) \)  

= \( 4 + \left( \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} \right) \)  

= \( 4 + \frac{19}{20} \)  

= \( 4\frac{19}{20} \)  

That matches option B.  

Now, common errors:  

- **Option A**: \( \frac{99}{20} \) — this is actually \( 4\frac{19}{20} \) as an improper fraction, but the question says “Leave your answer as a mixed number”, so students choosing this either didn’t read instructions carefully or thought “mixed number” meant “fraction” in general.  
- **Option C**: \( \frac{99}{40} \) — likely from adding \( \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{14}{40} + \frac{10}{40} = \frac{24}{40} \) incorrectly doubled? Actually no, \( \frac{99}{40} \) is \( 2\frac{19}{40} \) — but maybe they added \( 2\frac{7}{10} \) as \( \frac{27}{10} \) and \( 2\frac14 \) as \( \frac{9}{4} \), then did \( \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{108}{40} + \frac{90}{40} = \frac{198}{40} = \frac{99}{20} \) — but that’s A, not C. So maybe they forgot to convert to common denominator correctly and got denominator 40 by mistake (multiplying 10 and 4 without adjusting numerators correctly). Possibly: \( \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} \) with LCM 20, but if they use 40 and add 108+90=198/40=99/20, oh that’s still 99/20. Hmm. Actually \( 99/40 \) would come from incorrectly: \( 2.7 + 2.25 = 4.95 \), \( 4.95 = 495/100 = 99/20 \) — still not 99/40. Maybe they did \( \frac{7}{10}+\frac14 = \frac{7+1}{10+4} \) (adding numerators and denominators) = \( \frac{8}{14} \), then added whole numbers 4 + \( \frac{8}{14} \) = \( 4\frac{8}{14} \) which is D. But C is \( \frac{99}{40} \) — possibly they added \( 2\frac{7}{10} = \frac{27}{10} \), \( 2\frac14 = \frac94 \), then multiplied denominators 10×4=40, added numerators 27+9=36, so \( \frac{36}{40} \), but realized that’s too small, so maybe they mistakenly added whole numbers separately wrong? Not sure. Could be a random wrong common denominator with both whole numbers included wrong.  

Given typical errors:  

**Option D** \( 4\frac{8}{14} \) — classic “add numerators and denominators” mistake: \( \frac{7}{10} + \frac14 = \frac{7+1}{10+4} = \frac{8}{14} \), then whole numbers added correctly to 4.  

**Option A** \( \frac{99}{20} \) — correct improper fraction but not mixed number as asked.  

**Option B** \( 4\frac{19}{20} \) — correct answer.  

**Option C** \( \frac{99}{40} \) — maybe they did: convert to improper fractions incorrectly: \( 2\frac{7}{10} = \frac{27}{10} \), \( 2\frac14 = \frac94 \), found LCM = 40, so \( \frac{108}{40} + \frac{90}{40} = \frac{198}{40} = \frac{99}{20} \) — oh that’s A not C. So C might be if they did \( \frac{27}{10} + \frac94 \) and multiplied denominators 10×4=40, numerators 27+9=36, then also mistakenly added whole numbers 2+2=
