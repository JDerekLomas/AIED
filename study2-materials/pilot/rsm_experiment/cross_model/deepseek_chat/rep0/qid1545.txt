Let’s break this down step by step.  

The left-hand side is:  
\[
8 + 12 \div 4
\]  
Order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) says division before addition:  
\( 12 \div 4 = 3\), so \( 8 + 3 = 11 \).  

The right-hand side is:  
\[
(8+12) \div 4
\]  
Brackets first: \( 8+12 = 20\), then \( 20 \div 4 = 5 \).  

So \( 11 > 5 \), correct symbol is \( > \) (option A).  

---

**Potential misconceptions:**  
- Some students might ignore BIDMAS and do left-to-right:  
  \( 8+12 = 20\), \( 20 \div 4 = 5\) on both sides → choose \( = \) (C).  
- Others might do brackets correctly but still mix up order on LHS, possibly still getting \( 5 \) on both sides.  
- Some may think \( 8+12 \div 4\) means \( (8+12) \div 4\) because of the way the box is placed, but that’s reading the expression incorrectly, not a calculation error.  
- Option D (\( \geq \)) is a distractor for those who think “maybe equal sometimes” or confuse with inequality reasoning.

**By ability level:**

1. **Below basic**: Likely to ignore order of operations. Many will compute left-to-right on LHS (5) and correctly compute RHS (5) → choose C. Some might just guess.  

2. **Basic**: Some know order of operations but may still slip on comparison; a fair number will pick C due to misreading/misapplying BIDMAS, but more than below basic will get A.  

3. **Proficient**: Most know BIDMAS, but a few might rush and misread, still some C answers but majority A.  

4. **Advanced**: Almost all get A, very small errors possible from misreading notation.

basic: A=60% B=5% C=30% D=5%  
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=10% D=3%
