First, let’s solve the problem correctly:  

\( 2 \frac{1}{5} + 1 \frac{2}{5} \)  
Add the whole numbers: \( 2 + 1 = 3 \)  
Add the fractions: \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5} \)  
So the answer is \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \), which is option A.  

Option B: \( \frac{18}{5} \) is equivalent to \( 3 \frac{3}{5} \) but not in mixed-number form as requested — so it’s not correct given the instruction “leave your answer as a mixed number”.  

Option C: \( \frac{18}{10} \) would come from incorrectly adding denominators (treating as \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{1+2}{5+5} \)) — a common “add denominators” misconception.  

Option D: \( 3 \frac{3}{10} \) could come from converting both fractions incorrectly (e.g. thinking \( \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{10} \) and \( \frac{2}{5} = \frac{4}{10} \), adding to \( \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{10} \), and not adjusting the whole part), or from misreading denominators as 10 after incorrectly adding.  

---

**Reasoning about difficulty:**  
- The question is relatively easy because the denominators are the same, so no conversion is needed.  
- But it tests two things: (1) adding mixed numbers, (2) noticing the instruction “leave as a mixed number” (so an improper fraction is not accepted).  
- The trap options are plausible for students with specific misconceptions:  
  - Option C: add denominators (common for below basic).  
  - Option B: correct mathematically but ignores instruction on form (likely chosen by basic/proficient students who rush).  
  - Option D: might come from a fraction addition error (thinking denominators differ), but here denominators are the same, so this is less likely unless they misread \( \frac{1}{5} \) as \( \frac{1}{10} \) etc.  

Given these, the main distractors:  
- Below basic: many pick C (denominator addition) or D (random misstep).  
- Basic: some pick B (right value, wrong form) but many get A.  
- Proficient: almost all get A, some pick B if careless about instructions.  
- Advanced: all get A.

**Estimated percentages:**

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=40% D=15%  
basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%  
proficient: A=90% B=10% C=0% D=0%  
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%
