First, solve the question:  

We have \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\).  

The common denominator is \(2x\).  

Rewrite \(\frac{4}{x}\) as \(\frac{8}{2x}\).  

Now: \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}\).  

Correct answer is A.  

**Common errors:**  
- B: Adding denominators incorrectly: \( \frac{3+4}{2x+x} = \frac{7}{3x} \).  
- C: Forgetting the denominator 2 when combining: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3+8}{x} = \frac{11}{x} \) — here they think the common denominator is just \(x\), not \(2x\).  
- D: Possibly from adding numerators \(3+4=7\) and keeping denominator \(2x\).  

**Difficulty analysis:**  
This is a straightforward “add two algebraic fractions” problem. The main trap is the \(2x\) vs \(x\) denominator, which is a common class of error. Students at **below basic** will often add denominators or mis-handle the conversion of \(\frac{4}{x}\). **Proficient** and **advanced** students will mostly get it right.
