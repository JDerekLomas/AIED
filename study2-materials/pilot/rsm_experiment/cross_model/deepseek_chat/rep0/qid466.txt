Let's break this down.

We have: \(-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1\).  
So \( \star = \frac{-1}{-\frac{3}{4}} \).

Step-by-step:  
\[
\star = \frac{-1}{-\frac{3}{4}} = (-1) \times \left( -\frac{4}{3} \right) = \frac{4}{3}.
\]  
So the correct answer is **A) \(\frac{4}{3}\)**.

**Why students might get it wrong:**

1. **Sign errors** — Some might think two negatives make the answer negative, or mishandle the negative in the denominator.  
   If they compute \(-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1\) and try to solve by multiplying both sides by \(-\frac{4}{3}\), they should get \(\star = \frac{4}{3}\), but if they forget the sign of the original multiplier, they might pick \(-\frac{4}{3}\) (B).

2. **Reciprocal without sign check** — They might just take reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\) and get \(\frac{4}{3}\) but forget that the original coefficient is \(-\frac{3}{4}\), so the reciprocal of \(-\frac{3}{4}\) is \(-\frac{4}{3}\), but that’s **not** what \(\star\) is — because the equation is \(-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1\), not \(-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = 1\). This subtlety trips many:  
   Solving: \(\star = -1 \div (-\frac{3}{4}) = (-1) \times (-\frac{4}{3}) = +\frac{4}{3}\).

3. **Distractor C (\(\frac{3}{4}\))** — This comes from thinking the star is the same fraction as the coefficient, maybe from misreading the equation as \(-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -\frac{3}{4}\).

4. **Distractor D (\(-\frac{3}{4}\))** — This might be chosen by students who think \(\star\) should equal the coefficient because \(-1\) looks like an identity-ish result if \(\star=1\), but with sign confusion.

**Difficulty assessment:**  
This is harder than a simple “solve \(ax=b\)” with positives because both numbers are negative or fractional. But the actual calculation is two steps: divide by the fraction, handle two negatives.  
It’s short, so stronger students will be fine; weaker students often stumble on signs with fractions.

**Predictions:**

- **Below basic**: Many will pick B (\(-\frac{4}{3}\)) because they take reciprocal of \(-\frac{3}{4}\) without doing the full division with \(-1\). Some pick C or D at random.
- **Basic**: Still a high error rate on signs, but more will get A.
- **Proficient**: Most get A, but some slip to B.
- **Advanced**: Nearly all get A.
