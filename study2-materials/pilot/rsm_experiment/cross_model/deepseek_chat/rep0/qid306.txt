**Reasoning:**  
This question tests **order of operations** – specifically, whether students know that addition and subtraction have equal precedence and are done left-to-right (so in P, 4−5 is done first), and that multiplication takes priority over addition (so in Q, 5×6 is done first).  

- **Below basic:** Likely to guess or apply a “do operations in written order” approach inconsistently; many may think “add before subtract” or “do addition first” in P, leading to scattered choices.  
- **Basic:** Most recognise multiplication first in Q, but may still incorrectly think “addition before subtraction” in P, choosing C or A instead of B.  
- **Proficient:** Strong grasp of left-to-right for same-level operations, and multiplication priority; small errors from rushing possible.  
- **Advanced:** Virtually all will select B confidently; no real traps for this group.  

The question is **moderately tricky** for lower attainers because the first part (P) looks like a simple left-to-right calculation but can trigger a “do addition first” misconception if students overgeneralise “multiplication before addition” to “addition before subtraction”. However, the numbers are simple, so clearer thinkers will apply the rules correctly.
