First, let's analyse the question.  
We need to expand \((m-5)(m-7)\).  
Correct expansion:  
\[
m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35
\]  
So the correct answer is **B**.

---

**Potential errors:**

1. **Sign errors** – e.g., multiplying \(-5\) and \(-7\) and getting \(-35\) instead of \(+35\) → leads to D (\(m^2 - 12m - 35\)).
2. **Adding instead of subtracting the linear term coefficients** – e.g., \(-7m - 5m = -12m\), but someone might think \(-7m + (-5m) = -12m\) is fine, but they might mess up the sign for the constant term more often.
3. **Wrong signs on linear term** – e.g., thinking \((-5)(-7) = +35\) is correct, but mistakenly writing \(-7m - 5m = -2m\) → leads to A (\(m^2 - 2m - 35\) or \(m^2 - 2m + 35\)? Wait, A is \(m^2 - 2m - 35\), so that’s a double error: wrong constant and wrong linear term coefficient). Actually A would come from: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m = m^2 - 12m\)? No, A’s linear term is \(-2m\), so that’s from \(-7m - 5m = -12m\)? That doesn’t match. Let’s check:  
   For A: \(m^2 - 2m - 35\)  
   That’s from: \((m-5)(m-7) = m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\) mistaken as \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35\) (wrong sign on constant) AND mistakenly adding \(-7m - 5m = -2m\)?? That arithmetic is wrong: \(-7-5 = -12\), not \(-2\). So maybe they added \(-7 + (-5) = -12\) but wrote \(-2\) by misadding? Unlikely. Perhaps they did \((-5) + (-7) = -12\) for constants? Wait, no, constants multiply, not add.  
   Actually: If they did \(m \times m = m^2\),  
   \(m \times -7 = -7m\),  
   \(-5 \times m = -5m\),  
   \(-5 \times -7 = -35\) (wrong, should be \(+35\)),  
   and then combined \(-7m + (-5m) = -12m\)? But in A it’s \(-2m\)??  
   So maybe A is not a common error unless they also mess up combining like terms: e.g., thinking \(-7m - 5m = -2m\) (arithmetic error, 7–5=2, ignoring signs??). That’s possible for very weak students.

4. **C (\(m^2 + 12m + 35\))** comes from treating as \((m+5)(m+7)\) in their head, or sign errors making all signs positive.

**Likelihood per ability level:**

**Below basic**:  
- Many will guess.  
- Common error D: multiplying constants wrong: \(-5 \times -7 = -35\), then combine \(-7m -5m = -12m\) → D.  
- Some might pick C from misremembering signs entirely.  
- Some pick A from multiple arithmetic errors.  
- But D is the most tempting wrong answer for sign error in constant term.

Estimate:  
A: 15% (arithmetic slip in combining like terms)  
B: 30% (some will get it right)  
C: 25% (all plus signs)  
D: 30% (constant sign wrong)

---

**Basic**:  
- Still a lot of sign errors, but more will get B correct.  
- D still common for constant sign mistake.  
- C less common than below basic.  
- A less common.

Estimate:  
A: 10%  
B: 50%  
C: 15%  
D: 25%

**Proficient**:  
- Most know FOIL and sign rules.  
- Main trap is D (constant sign wrong), but less frequent.  
- Some might mis-combine \(-7m - 5m\) but unlikely.  
- High accuracy.

Estimate:  
A: 5%  
B: 85%  
C: 5%  
D: 5%

**Advanced**:  
- Almost all correct.  
- Rare slips might be D, but
