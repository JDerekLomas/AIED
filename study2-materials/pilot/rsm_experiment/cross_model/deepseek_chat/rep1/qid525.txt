below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%

**Reasoning:**  
This question tests addition of mixed numbers with different denominators (10 and 4). The main challenges are:
1. Converting to improper fractions or adding whole numbers and fractional parts separately.
2. Finding a common denominator (20 is the LCM).
3. Avoiding the trap of adding denominators (which would give 14, making D attractive for weaker students).  

**Option analysis:**  
- **B** is correct: \(2\frac{7}{10} + 2\frac{1}{4} = 4 + \left(\frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20}\right) = 4\frac{19}{20}\).  
- **A** (\(\frac{99}{20}\)) is the correct improper fraction, but the question asks for a mixed number, so this is a misreading of the instruction.  
- **C** (\(\frac{99}{40}\)) results from using a common denominator of 40 (not simplest) and then incorrectly adding numerators without adjusting correctly, or from adding denominators as well.  
- **D** (\(4\frac{8}{14}\)) is the classic error of adding both whole numbers and adding numerators *and denominators*: \(4\frac{7+1}{10+4}\). This is a common misconception at the below-basic level.

The question is moderately difficult for weaker students because of the different denominators and the need to convert or find equivalent fractions. However, the numbers are fairly simple, and the correct common denominator (20) is easy to find. Proficient and advanced students will almost all choose B, with only a small percentage misreading the "mixed number" requirement and choosing A. Below-basic students are drawn to D due to the denominator addition error, and to C from miscalculations with the denominators.
