First, let’s analyse the question.  
The brackets are \((2p - 1)(3p - 4)\).  
The arrows point at \(-1\) and \(-4\).  
When expanding, the product of these two terms is \((-1) \times (-4) = +4\).  

**Common misconceptions/errors:**
1. Forgetting that a negative times a negative is positive, so might choose \(-4\) (option B).
2. Miscounting or misreading the arrows (thinking they point at different terms) — unlikely here as it’s visually clear.
3. Misunderstanding that the product is just \((-1) \times (-4)\) — might incorrectly combine with other terms (but the question only asks for the product of the two indicated terms).

**Difficulty assessment:**  
This is a relatively straightforward question for students comfortable with expanding brackets, but for weaker students the negative signs could lead to sign errors.  
It’s simpler than a full expansion question because it isolates one product, reducing working memory load.  
No distraction from other products or like-terms.

**Predictions by ability level:**

- **Below basic:** Many will know they have to multiply the numbers but may misapply sign rules. A significant proportion will pick \(-4\). Some may guess other numbers if they add instead of multiply.  
  Estimated: A=40% B=45% C=10% D=5%

- **Basic:** Still a noticeable error rate on sign, but more will get it right.  
  Estimated: A=70% B=25% C=3% D=2%

- **Proficient:** Almost all will know the rule, rare sign error.  
  Estimated: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%

- **Advanced:** Virtually all correct.  
  Estimated: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
