below_basic: A=20% B=50% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

**Rationale:**  
This question tests understanding of the mean and the importance of including zero in the count and the sum. Option B is a common trap due to order of operations (division before addition), so it effectively calculates \(0+1+3+4+(7 \div 5)\). Option C misses the zero from the sum and also uses the wrong count (4 instead of 5). Option A includes the correct numbers in the sum but omits the zero, though it divides by 5.  

**For below basic/basic students:** Many will pick B because they mimic "add up and divide by 5" without considering order of operations, or pick A/C because they ignore the zero in the sum.  

**For proficient students:** Most will recognize none are fully correct (correct mean = \(\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}\)), so choose D. Some may still slip into B's trap.  

**For advanced students:** All will see the flaws instantly and choose D.
