Let's break this down.  

We have:  
\[
-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1
\]  
Let \(\star = x\). Then:  
\[
-\frac{3}{4} \times x = -1
\]  
Multiply both sides by \(-\frac{4}{3}\):  
\[
x = (-1) \times \left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) = \frac{4}{3}
\]  

So correct answer: \( \frac{4}{3} \) → Option A.

**Why students might choose wrong answers**:

- **B) \(-\frac{4}{3}\)**: They might think a negative times a negative is needed to give negative one (misremembering sign rules) or they might solve \(-\frac{3}{4}x = -1\) and forget to check sign at the end.  
  Actually: \(-\frac{3}{4} \times (-\frac{4}{3}) = +1\), not \(-1\), so B is wrong.

- **C) \(\frac{3}{4}\)**: Possibly just flipped fraction without adjusting sign, or guessed reciprocal but ignored the \(-1\) target.

- **D) \(-\frac{3}{4}\)**: Maybe thought it's \(-\frac{3}{4} \times (-\frac{3}{4}) = ?\), but that’s \(\frac{9}{16}\).

**Difficulty factors**:

1. Two negatives in equation: \(-\frac{3}{4}\) times \(x\) equals \(-1\).  
   Some students get confused whether \(x\) should be positive or negative.

2. The reciprocal idea is needed: \(x\) is the reciprocal of \(-\frac{3}{4}\) up to a sign adjustment because \((-\frac{3}{4}) \times (\frac{4}{3}) = -1\)? Wait — check:  
   \((-\frac{3}{4}) \times (\frac{4}{3}) = -1\)? Yes: \( -\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -\frac{12}{12} = -1\).  
   So indeed \(x = \frac{4}{3}\) works, positive.

   The trap: seeing \( -1 \) on the right, they might think \(x\) must be negative because “negative × negative = positive” so to get \(-1\), maybe they think \(x\) positive gives negative product only if first number is negative — but here first number IS negative, so positive \(x\) gives negative product. So correct reasoning leads to positive \(x\).

**Predicted choices by ability**:

- **Below basic**: Likely to guess randomly among all options, maybe slightly drawn to C or D because numbers look like original fraction. Some might pick B because they think answer should be negative.  
  Distribution: A ~25%, B ~35%, C ~20%, D ~20%

- **Basic**: Might attempt reciprocal but sign confusion: many pick B (negative reciprocal).  
  Distribution: A ~40%, B ~45%, C ~10%, D ~5%

- **Proficient**: Most get reciprocal idea right, but some slip on sign. Majority pick A.  
  Distribution: A ~75%, B ~20%, C ~3%, D ~2%

- **Advanced**: Almost all get correct. Very few sign errors.  
  Distribution: A ~95%, B ~3%, C ~1%, D ~1%
