**Reasoning:**  
Tom’s step is correct: add 5 to both sides to get \(\frac{x}{3}=17\).  
Katie’s step \(x-5=36\) would come from multiplying *only the first term* by 3, not correctly applying operations to both sides—a common error when students misapply “do the same to both sides.”  

**At below-basic level**, many students struggle with balancing operations and may think Katie’s move is valid (especially if they focus on “removing the fraction” without balancing). Some might guess neither or both.  

**At basic level**, more recognize Tom is correct but a significant minority still make Katie’s error or think both are valid.  

**At proficient level**, nearly all spot Tom’s correctness and see Katie’s step as unbalanced. A few may slip into thinking “multiply everything by 3” applies to the 5 as well, leading them to select C.  

**At advanced level**, almost all answer correctly. The subtlety here is that Katie’s mistake is a classic one, but the numbers are simple and the question explicitly asks about the *next step*, making it easier for stronger students to detect the imbalance immediately.
