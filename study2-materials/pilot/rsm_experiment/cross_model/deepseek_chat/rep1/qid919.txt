**Analysis of question difficulty:**  
This question asks for \( y \) when \( x = 0.3 \) for \( y = 3x^2 \).  
The key potential error is misinterpreting \( 3x^2 \) as \( (3x)^2 \) — if that mistake is made, \( (3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81 \), which is option A.  
The correct calculation is \( 3 \times (0.3^2) = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27 \), which is option B.  

**Factors affecting difficulty:**  
- Numbers are decimals, not whole numbers, which can trip some students.  
- \( 0.3^2 = 0.09 \) is a known stumbling block (students may think \( 0.3^2 = 0.9 \)), leading to \( 3 \times 0.9 = 2.7 \) (option D).  
- Option C (1.8) could come from \( 3 \times 0.6 \) (confusing square with double).  

**Likely student responses by ability:**  
**Below basic:** Likely to pick A (thinking \( (3x)^2 \)) or D (thinking \( 0.3^2 = 0.9 \)). Some might guess.  
**Basic:** Still a significant number choosing A due to notation misunderstanding, but fewer than below basic. More choose B (correct) than below basic.  
**Proficient:** Most will know order of operations, but some may rush and pick A if they misread. Very few pick D.  
**Advanced:** Almost all correct; rare errors due to misreading.
