basic: A=35% B=20% C=40% D=5%  
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%  
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=4% D=1%  

**Reasoning:**  
This question tests solving a linear equation of the form \( a = \frac{b}{c} \). The common error is to mishandle the multiplication by 4 in step 1 — e.g., multiplying only the numerator or forgetting to multiply both sides correctly.  

- **Below basic:** Likely to struggle with the structure; many will check step 2 in isolation (59+1=60, so k=59? confusion) and may think step 2 is correct if they mis-solve step 1. A high proportion might pick C (both correct) because they see step 2 as “just adding 1” without verifying step 1.  
- **Basic:** Some will recognize step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4), but then incorrectly think step 2 is wrong because they miscalculate 60-1=59. Others might wrongly think step 1 is incorrect because they expect subtracting 1 first (order-of-operations misconception).  
- **Proficient:** Most will see step 1 is correct and step 2 is a straightforward subtraction error (60-1=59, not 61), so choose A.  
- **Advanced:** Almost all will quickly identify step 1 correct, step 2 wrong.  

The question is moderately easy for proficient students because the numbers are simple and step 2’s error is a basic arithmetic slip, not a structural algebra mistake. However, weaker students often miss the step 2 error because they focus on process (“he isolated k”) rather than arithmetic accuracy.
