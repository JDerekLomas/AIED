**Analysis of the question**

This is an order-of-operations question comparing \( 8 + 12 \div 4 \) with \( (8+12) \div 4 \).

- Left side: \( 8 + 12 \div 4 = 8 + 3 = 11 \) (division before addition).
- Right side: \( (8+12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5 \).

So \( 11 > 5 \), meaning the correct symbol is \( > \) (option A).

Common errors:  
1. Misapplying BIDMAS/BODMAS by doing addition before division on the left, giving \( 20 \div 4 = 5 \) and thinking they are equal → choose C.  
2. Noticing parentheses change things but miscomputing one side → possibly choose B (thinking left side smaller).  
3. Seeing \(\geq\) (D) might attract a few who think “either could be true depending on interpretation” or confuse with inequality reasoning.  

This question has no arithmetic complexity — the numbers are simple. The only difficulty is remembering division before addition when no brackets are present. Many weaker students will incorrectly treat \(8+12 \div 4\) as \((8+12) \div 4\) due to reading left-to-right.
