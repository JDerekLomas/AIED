Let’s break this down.

**Question content:**  
Two separate problems:  
P: \( 4 - 5 + 6 \)  
Q: \( 4 + 5 \times 6 \)  

It asks: Which calculation should you do first in each problem?  

**Key knowledge tested:**  
- For P: Order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS) says addition and subtraction are done left to right (same precedence). So \( 4 - 5 \) comes first.  
- For Q: Multiplication before addition, so \( 5 \times 6 \) first.  

**Likely student thinking by ability:**  

**Below basic**  
- May not recall left-to-right for same precedence in P, might incorrectly think "addition first" (i.e., \( 5+6 \) first) because of "BIDMAS" mnemonic without nuance.  
- For Q, may incorrectly do left-to-right ignoring multiplication precedence, so choose \( 4+5 \) first.  
- That corresponds to option C (P: \( 5+6 \), Q: \( 4+5 \)). But some below basic might choose B for Q correctly but mess up P? Possibly less likely.  
- I’d expect high % for C here, some for A (left-to-right both), some for D (if they think addition first in P but correct in Q).  
- Estimate: C highest (common BIDMAS trap), then A (left-to-right both), then D (addition first in P, but correct in Q), then B (correct P, wrong Q) least likely.  

**Basic**  
- Some will know multiplication first in Q, but still get P wrong (addition first misconception) → choose D.  
- Some will get both right → choose B.  
- Some will still fall into C trap.  
- Expect more B and D, fewer A and C than below basic.  

**Proficient**  
- Mostly know both: B is fully correct.  
- Some may slip on P if they misremember “addition before subtraction” myth, so D possible.  
- Minimal A or C.  

**Advanced**  
- Almost all B, negligible others.  

**Assigning percentages:**  

**Below basic**  
A: 25% (some left-to-right)  
B: 10% (accidentally correct? unlikely)  
C: 50% (both wrong due to BIDMAS letter order trap)  
D: 15% (correct Q, wrong P due to same trap)  

**Basic**  
A: 15%  
B: 35% (both correct)  
C: 25% (both wrong)  
D: 25% (correct Q only)  

**Proficient**  
A: 5%  
B: 80%  
C: 5%  
D: 10% (know Q correct but slip on P)  

**Advanced**  
A: 1%  
B: 97%  
C: 1%  
D: 1%
