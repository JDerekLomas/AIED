First, let's solve the equation correctly:  

\[
10 = \frac{5}{p}
\]  

Multiply both sides by \(p\):  
\[
10p = 5
\]  
Divide both sides by 10:  
\[
p = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5
\]  

So the correct answer is **A) \(p = 0.5\)**.

**Analysis of misconceptions:**  

1. **Inversion error** – Some students might think they can just swap numerator and denominator:  
   \(10 = \frac{5}{p} \rightarrow p = \frac{10}{5} = 2\) (choosing C).  
   This is a common mistake when the variable is in the denominator, but note: here \(10\) is not in a fraction, so the error rate might be lower than if both sides were fractions.  

2. **Decimal vs fraction confusion** –  
   \(p = 0.5\) is a decimal, \(p = \frac{1}{2}\), but some might think \(p = 50\) if they mistakenly multiply \(10 \times 5\).  

3. **No-solution choice D** – Some might think if \(p=0\) is not allowed (true, but irrelevant to solving), they might pick D if they wrongly think equation is impossible.

**Likelihood of errors by ability level:**  

**Below basic:**  
Likely to invert incorrectly → pick C (2) a lot. Some might pick B (50) from multiplying 5×10. Only a small portion will get 0.5 correct.  

**Basic:**  
Still a significant inversion error rate, but more will correctly solve. Still some confusion between 0.5 and 50.  

**Proficient:**  
Most will get correct answer, but a small fraction might rush and invert wrongly.  

**Advanced:**  
Almost all will solve correctly.
