First, let’s solve the question correctly:  

\[
\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}.
\]  

Correct answer: **A**.

**Common errors:**  
- **B** \(\frac{7}{3x}\) – from adding numerators 3+4=7 and denominators 2x+x=3x (incorrectly adding denominators as if they were fractions \(\frac{3}{2}+\frac{4}{1}\)).  
- **C** \(\frac{11}{x}\) – from adding numerators 3+8=11 but forgetting the denominator 2x, maybe by incorrectly rewriting \(\frac{4}{x}\) as \(\frac{4}{1x}\) and incorrectly combining.  
- **D** \(\frac{7}{2x}\) – from adding numerators 3+4=7 and keeping denominator 2x (forgetting to adjust \(\frac{4}{x}\) to denominator 2x properly).

**Analysis of difficulty:**  
This is a straightforward “add two algebraic fractions with different denominators” problem. The denominators differ only by a factor of 2, so it’s easier than ones with unrelated denominators.  

**Possible traps:**  
- Mistake: Adding denominators when adding fractions (common in below_basic students) → leads to B.  
- Mistake: Correctly adjusting \(\frac{4}{x}\) to \(\frac{8}{2x}\) but then adding denominators 2x+2x=4x (unlikely here as numbers simple) – not an option, so not a major trap.  
- Mistake: Forgetting to multiply numerator of \(\frac{4}{x}\) by 2, so gets 3+4=7 over 2x → D.  
- Mistake: Doing \(\frac{3}{2x}+\frac{4}{x} = \frac{3+4}{x} = \frac{7}{x}\) (not an option) or \(\frac{3+8}{x}=\frac{11}{x}\) → C.

Given options, C is attractive if student thinks:  
\(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{x}\) (wrong conversion) → \(\frac{11}{x}\), but that’s less common than error D.

**Predicted percentages:**

**Below_basic:**  
Likely high error rate. Many will add tops and bottoms directly → B (\(\frac{7}{3x}\)). Also, D (\(\frac{7}{2x}\)) is a plausible error (common denominator forgotten). Some random guesses.  

- **A** = 30%  
- **B** = 35%  
- **C** = 15%  
- **D** = 20%

**Basic:**  
Still significant errors but more likely D (forgot to convert properly) than B. Some might pick C.  

- **A** = 50%  
- **B** = 20%  
- **C** = 15%  
- **D** = 15%

**Proficient:**  
Most will get correct, but some may rush and pick D (forgetting to multiply numerator of 4/x by 2).  

- **A** = 85%  
- **B** = 5%  
- **C** = 5%  
- **D** = 5%

**Advanced:**  
Almost all correct.  

- **A** = 98%  
- **B** = 1%  
- **C** = 1%  
- **D** = 0%
