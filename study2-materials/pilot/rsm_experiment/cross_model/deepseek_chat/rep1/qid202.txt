**Analysis of the question**

This is an addition of two mixed numbers with **the same denominator** (5).  
The correct method is to add the whole numbers: \( 2 + 1 = 3 \), then add the fractions: \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5} \).  
So the result is \( 3\frac{3}{5} \) (option A).

**Why it might still be answered incorrectly:**

- **Option B**: \( \frac{18}{5} \) is the improper fraction form of \( 3\frac{3}{5} \). The question says “Leave your answer as a mixed number,” so this is not in the requested form, but some students might convert to improper fraction out of habit and not read instructions carefully.
- **Option C**: \( \frac{18}{10} \) comes from incorrectly adding denominators (treating them like whole numbers: \( 1+2=3 \) numerator, \( 5+5=10 \) denominator, plus possibly adding whole numbers separately but forgetting they already added wholes). This is a common “add denominators” fraction misconception, but here both denominators are the same so students might not fall into that trap as easily as with different denominators.
- **Option D**: \( 3\frac{3}{10} \) is a mix of correct whole numbers but adding denominators in the fraction part (\( 1/5 + 2/5 \) mistaken as \( 3/10 \)).

Given that the denominators are the same, the most likely wrong answer for weaker students is **D** (adding denominators for fractions) or **B** (not writing as mixed number). Option C is less likely since it’s wholly an improper fraction with wrong denominator.

**Likelihood of errors by ability level:**

- **Below basic**: Likely to add denominators (D), or possibly pick C (adding denominators and also writing as improper fraction). Some might pick B if they know improper fractions but miss “mixed number” instruction. Still, A should be the most chosen even here because the numbers are simple.
- **Basic**: Most will get A, but some will pick D (denominator error) or B (ignoring “mixed number”).
- **Proficient**: Almost all get A, but a few might pick B from automatic conversion to improper fraction and not reading instruction.
- **Advanced**: Nearly 100% A, maybe a tiny slip to B if rushing.

**Estimates:**

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%  
basic: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%  
proficient: A=95% B=5% C=0% D=0%  
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
