Alright, let’s break this down.  

We have:  

\[
3p = \frac{1}{12}
\]  
Divide both sides by 3:  
\[
p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}
\]  

Correct answer: **B**.

### Step 1 – Consider the common errors
1. **Option A (\(\frac14\))**: This comes from **inverting the division incorrectly** — some students think "divide by 3" means take \(\frac{1}{12} \times 4\)? Not likely directly here, but maybe they think \(3p = \frac{1}{12} \) → multiply both sides by 4 (because \(3 \times 4 = 12\)) → \(p = \frac{4}{12} = \frac14\). Yes, that’s a plausible wrong step: they incorrectly think “to get rid of the 3, multiply by 4” (mixing up \(3 \times 4 = 12\) with solving).  

2. **Option C (4)**: This is from **multiplying** instead of dividing: \(3p = \frac{1}{12} \) → \(p = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac14\), then misreading \(\frac14\) as 4? Or simply doing \(p = \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} = 0.25\), then misreading option? That’s less likely, but maybe they think “p = 12 ÷ 3 = 4” from misarranging \(\frac{1}{12} = 3p\) → \(p = \frac{1}{12 \times 3}\)?? That’s not 4. Actually, 4 could come from \(p = \frac{12}{3} = 4\) — they took the denominator 12 and divided by the 3 coefficient.

3. **Option D (\(\frac19\))**: This is \( \frac{1}{12-3} \)? Not obvious. Possibly they think \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\) → \(p = \frac{1}{12-3} = \frac{1}{9}\)?? That’s strange. Maybe they misremember dividing fractions: \(\frac{1}{12} \div 3\) → \(\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\) but they mistakenly added denominators 12+3=15? No, 12×3=36 is correct. Perhaps \(\frac{1}{12} \div \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{4}\) but that’s option A. D may be a random guess.

Given common teaching: The main trap is **A** (\(\frac14\)) because students often “multiply by 4” when they see 3 and \(\frac{1}{12}\) (wanting 12 in denominator).

### Step 2 – Relate to ability levels

**Below Basic**: Likely to guess randomly-ish, but some will pick A because it feels familiar (\(\frac14\) is common). Some might multiply 3 × \(\frac{1}{12}\) and get \(\frac14\) but then pick C (4) by misreading decimals or whole numbers. B will get a chunk because it’s correct, but maybe not majority.

**Basic**: Still a significant portion making the ×4 error (A). Some might divide 12 by 3 to get 4 (C). Correct answer B will be chosen by more than Below Basic but still not majority.

**Proficient**: Most know to divide by 3 → multiply by \(\frac13\). Main trap left is A if they rush and multiply by 4 instead of dividing by 3. B will be strong majority.

**Advanced**: Almost all get B. Rare errors.

### Step 3 – Assign percentages

Below Basic: Often 25% correct by chance/partial knowledge.  
- Let’s say 25% B, 35% A (main trap), 25% C (multiply wrong), 15% D (random).

Basic: More get B, but A still strong.  
- B 45%, A 30%, C 15%, D 10%.

Proficient: High success.  
- B 85%, A 10% (rush), C 3%, D 2%.

Advanced: Very high success.  
- B 95%, A 3%, C 1%, D 1%.

**Final answer:**
below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=25% D=15%
