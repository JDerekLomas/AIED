below_basic: A=50% B=10% C=35% D=5%
basic: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0% C=1% D=0%

**Reasoning:**  
This question directly tests the convention that \( a \div (b+c) \) should be written as \(\frac{a}{b+c}\), i.e., the whole sum in the denominator. The main trap is option C (\(\frac{c}{h}+4\)), which represents \( c \div h + 4 \), a common misreading when brackets are ignored.  

For **below basic** students, many will miss the brackets and choose C. Some may also confuse the order and choose D.  

**Basic** students still have a noticeable error rate for C, but most recognise the correct form.  

**Proficient** and **advanced** students are very unlikely to make mistakes here, because the expression is simple and the brackets make the intended grouping clear. The question lacks additional complexity (like nested operations or minus signs) that might increase confusion, so error rates are very low at higher levels.
