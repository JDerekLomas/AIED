Let’s break this down.

**Step 1 – Understanding the question**  
The expression is: \( 3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 \)  
Order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) says: multiplication first, then addition/subtraction left to right.

**Step 2 – Correct working**  
First: \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)  
So expression becomes: \( 3 - 5 + 8 \)  
Now left to right: \( 3 - 5 = -2 \)  
Then: \( -2 + 8 = 6 \)  

Correct answer: **A) 6**

**Step 3 – Common mistakes**  

1. **Left-to-right ignoring multiplication first**  
   \( 3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 = 2\), then \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) → **B) 4** (very common error among weaker students).  

2. **Multiplication first but wrong subtraction/addition order**  
   Some might do \( 3 - (5 + 8) \) after multiplying, i.e., \( 3 - 13 = -10 \) → **D) -10** (less common but seen).  

3. **Multiplication first but sign error**  
   Another possible wrong path: \( 3 - 5 + 8 \) read as \( 3 - (5+8) \) yields -10; or \( 3 - 5 = -2\), then treat \( -2 + 8 \) incorrectly as \( - (2+8) = -10\)? That’s same as D again. Or maybe \( 3 - (5+4\times2) = 3 - (5+8) = -10 \) indeed.  

4. **Option C) -12** likely from a total misunderstanding: perhaps \( (3-5+4) \times 2 = 2\times 2 = 4\) not -12, so -12 is a rarer error — maybe \( 3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 = 2\), then \( 2 \times (-2)? \) No, doesn’t match numbers. Possibly \( (3-5) \times (4+2) = (-2)\times 6 = -12\) — misreading structure completely.  

**Step 4 – Likelihood by ability**  

**Below basic**: Many will ignore BIDMAS, go left-to-right → pick B) 4 (most common). Some might force parentheses incorrectly to get D) -10. A) 6 will be chosen by a few who guess or remember multiplication first but may still mess up signs.  

**Basic**: Still high error rate on B) 4, but some will know multiplication first. Still a significant portion may incorrectly group addition before subtraction to get D) -10.  

**Proficient**: Majority know multiplication first and left-to-right for +/−, so mostly A) 6. Some may slip into D) -10 if they think addition before subtraction in order of operations (misremembering that + and − are same precedence).  

**Advanced**: Almost all get A) 6; rare errors.

**Step 5 – Estimated percentages**  

below_basic: A=25% B=50% C=10% D=15%  
basic: A=60% B=25% C=5% D=10%  
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=2% D=8%  
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
