Looking at this question carefully, I need to analyze what makes it tricky for different ability levels.

The key insight is that students need to understand that dividing both sides by -3/4 means star = -1 ÷ (-3/4) = 4/3, or using the reciprocal method where -1 is the result and you need the reciprocal of -3/4 but need to account for the negative sign.

For Below Basic students: They're most likely to use the sign confusion misconception where they'd see -3/4 multiplying unknown to get -1, think "multiplying, so just reciprocal" to get -4/3 to "cancel out" negative with negative. Also heavily draw-based.

For Basic students: Same sign-based error as above remains dominant - they understand the operation concept but get mixed up about preserving sign.

This is genuinely hard because:
- The equation only has two numbers with opposite signs
- Requires either understanding division with negatives, OR reciprocal concept with signs handled
- Classic negative-creation confusion traps students
- The calculation itself isn't hard - understanding what's needed is

Actually very testable indeed at GCSE - simple number, pure fraction algebra triggers this classic failure.

below_basic: A=15% B=55% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=45% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=5% D=3%
