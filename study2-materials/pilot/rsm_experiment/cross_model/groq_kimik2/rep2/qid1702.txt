This is an extremely straightforward plug-in question. Students who struggle with straight line equation misconceptions won't be lured – there are no axes, "solve for y first" traps have been bypassed. Students literally need only substitute a given number and deal with the consequent negative.

below_basic (fewer than 20 % would get the right value without seeing possible answers, many treat 10x as zero). Even with seeing answers about a half would multiply rather than collect the known y:
below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%

basic (most follow the normal route of first isolating x and remembering ±): some stop after reaching –3/10 as (–6) and misread "positive 33" rather than carry the decimal two figures, others just miscarry division):
basic: A=10% B=75% C=10% D=5%

proficient make sign errors much smaller.
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%.

advanced get it straight.
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
