Looking at this question, I need to analyze what specific errors students might make when expanding (m-5)(m-7).

The correct answer is D: m² - 12m - 35

Common errors:
1. Sign errors when multiplying -5 × -7 = -35 (instead of +35) - this would lead students to avoid option B with +35 correctly
2. Forgetting to collect like terms properly, leading to wrong coefficients
3. Systematic FOIL errors like mixing up signs when multiplying the "outers" -(5m) - (7m) = -12m vs +(5m) + (7m) = +12m

This is actually a fairly standard bracket expansion where the trap level is moderate because:
- The numbers 5 and 7 are reasonable to work with
- But sign management is tested at multiple points
- Students who only check the middle or final terms might get caught by partial checking

below_basic: A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%
(These students struggle most with sign errors, many will incorrectly get +35 instead of -35, and make arithmetic in collecting terms)

basic: A=25% B=35% C=15% D=25%
(Somewhat better but still significant confusion around signs and systematic calculation errors)

proficient: A=15% B=20% C=5% D=60%
(Clear improvement recognising correct approaches, basic arithmetic errors persist to some degree)

advanced: A=0% B=15% C=0% D=85%
(A small error rate for minor arithmetic/arithmetic errors or lack of attention checking every component)
