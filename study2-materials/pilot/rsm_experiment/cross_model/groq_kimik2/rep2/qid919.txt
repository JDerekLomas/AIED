Looking at this question, I need to analyze the specific trap: students calculating (3 × 0.3) = 0.9, seeing option A (0.81) and thinking they made a small addition/calculation error since 0.9 and 0.81 are close in value, when actually they should calculate 3 × (0.3²) = 3 × 0.09 = 0.27.

The decimal multiplication creates a real difficulty here. Many students struggle with:
1. Understanding it's 3 times the square, not the square of the whole thing
2. Computing 0.09 in their head accurately  
3. Knowing which operation goes into the calculator first (squaring or multiplying)

Most students getting wrong answer are going with A (being one decimal place or calculation step out), followed by not getting decimal calculation at all and guessing wildly or making different error.
below_basic: A=50% B=15% C=35% D=0%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=75% C=5% D=0%
advanced: A=05% B=90% C=0% D=0%
