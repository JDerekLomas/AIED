Key difficulty: Substituting x = 0 but missing decimal nature

Below Basic:
Many substitute correctly 4(0) but then 2y = 10 – reading y = 10 – some give 20 as 'answer'.
More of them will divide 10 by 2 and write nothing else — see D very likely.
A fair proportion, still confusing 'what goes in box?' against what calculation equals, pick 10 then or think a table with numbers only has no fractions. Many choose one of two whole-number ones, chiefly B & C. Splits between them and those who actually finish calc → D.

Basic: Similar, with fewer 16-type arithmetical blunders & better decimal literacy, so jump D to ~75%, remainder mainly careless reading chooses wrong spot on 'ten is in equation'.

Proficient: Almost all realise x = 0 gives immediately 10/2 without any rearrangement, decimals OK. Error rate now ≈8%. Distractors left over as misread/fraction slipup mostly. D still dominates.

Advanced: They see in <1 sec that at the axis intercept x = 0 means y = 5. This gives decimal form 5·0: correct symbol must be D (2.5 is a decoy which divides further — they don't fall down this one, so D is literally 100%).
