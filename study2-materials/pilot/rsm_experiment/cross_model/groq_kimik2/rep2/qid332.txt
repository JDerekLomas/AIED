Looking carefully at each option:

Tom: \(\frac{x}{3}-5=12\) leads to \(\frac{x}{3}=17\)
This can be done by adding 5 to both sides. Correct - students will recall basic one-step equation procedures work.

Katie: \(\frac{x}{3}-5 = 12\) leads to \(x-5=36\)
This crosses over with proportion in the equation. It reflects error-pattern 'cross multiplying 12 and 3 to get the multiple 3×4 = 12 on the RHS leading to a mismatch between terms by the transformation 3 × LSH.

While conceptually Tom’s path only one algebraic step -add, Katie's reflects a known but wrong pattern to many (that RHS value gets scaled). Strong students recognize immediately it is faulty by checking by substitution and/or by checking the correct algebra - multiply all terms first.

At Higher: Most know Tom only.
