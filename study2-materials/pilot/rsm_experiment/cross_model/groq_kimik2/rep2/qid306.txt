below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=35% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%

Here's my reasoning:

**Below Basic students (20th percentile):** These students would likely get both problems wrong, struggling with even basic operator awareness. But notably some might still remember to check all + and - as sequential so correctly pick subtractions to be 'first'.

- **40% chose A (4-5, 4+5)** - These students likely either 'go left-to-right by default' for easy reading; Problem Q triggers addition left-to-side errors. (They know no priority rules are needed, yet pick an add/subtract left because that's what came next intuitively.)  

- **25% to B** - Right direction yet mixed error on problem Q but wrong in second problem  
- Lower 30% go to "adding-looking traps on both:  D (first priority)  

**Basic Students:** These kids 'nearly understand yet half-cognitive on operation priority'
This distribution would be close mirror to above yet shift *significantly B gains as they recall multiply-first.

**35% on both A & B**: The commonality here indicates left-right vs half right BID**M remembered** without strong conviction

**Proficant Students:**
Clear memory of multiplication-First in Problem Q, much but often uncertain whether subtraction-first can be taken literally on the sub-sequential 'same-precedence additions'

**Advance Students: Mastery Group**
Only ~15% missed perfect B here as their knowledge is embedded correctly with 85% accuracy rate on B in tests
