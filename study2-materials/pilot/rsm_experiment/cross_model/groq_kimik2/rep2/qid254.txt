Looking at this question, students need to analyze four separate calculations, not perform computation. Each option corresponds to a common misconception about the mean.

Here's what most drives errors:

Most obviously, A fails with 0 included in the list but excluded from the calculation.
B traps students who haven't fully mastered the operation of dividing every summand.
C represents the extremely common mode-mean or mean-confusion misconception about how many total terms there are. With zero included many students will argue there shouldn't be 4 terms.
D presents some resistance – some correctly identifying it as wrong but unsure enough to not commit strongly on a "none of the above", making partial progress towards recognizing issues with zero treatment.

What's clever here is that the inclusion of zero increases the ambiguity from a pure counting exercise without obviously being just another mean question focused at zero exclusion. Students don't default immediately into "four items and exclude zero", they must reason about a case they've possibly never considered before but often discuss with other examples or contexts they know are treated like there exists zero items yet calculated with full counts. In combination, while 2 of (A+B+C) options both look valid in ways that trip up weak understanding. Stronger students who identify "none" as having specific non-option might also hesitate at confirming.
