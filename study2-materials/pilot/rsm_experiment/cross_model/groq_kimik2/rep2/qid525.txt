Let me break down what makes this specific question unique:

**What makes error-worthy:**
- Denominators are 10 and 4 (not friendly pairs like 2/4 or 3/6)
- Requires changing to common denominator for just the fraction parts
- Requires converting improper fraction after addition
- Multiple trap answers exist

**What makes forgiving:**
- Fraction wholes don't need borrowing
- Numbers are small and straightforward
- Option D uses the "add across denominators" error that will feel wrong (14 is clearly 7+10+ -1, not just a made-up number)

Key misconception here is adding across denominators, but with the specific numbers here, it's subtle. Students think "10 and 4... what can work here?" - D's 14 comes from the simple (7+1)/(10+4), which might feel reasonable for students struggling to conceptualize LCM.

Students who know to find denominators still mess up conversion to mixed numbers; there's room between fraction sum and mixed representation at several decision points.

Let me analyze error rates per ability, including what might be the biggest subtle pit trap; the 40 vs final denom error leading to 20 confusion:

**Percentage breakdown:**
below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=40% D=25%
This group struggles with common denominators and decimal conversion; seeing 20 makes C feel plausible (likely convert wrong denominator).

basic: A=15% B=40% C=25% D=15%
Basic students often reach the common denominator correctly but make addition/arithmetic errors with final fractions leading to numerators like 99/40 that "look sensible enough".
They also sometimes know their answer shouldn't convert wrong to (D) 8/14.

proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=3%
Proficient groups can find LCM(10,4) and get the numerator right. Fewer pick C or the other mistakes.

advanced: A=3% B=93% C=2% D=1%
Students confident converting 79/20 to proper mixed number. Most won't fall for answer A thinking they might get it wrong conversion.

Most revealing is that this exact (7/10) and similar fraction questions where denominators aren't friendly pairs like factors often trigger the "add denominators directly for sum or cross-multipliers for errors". But the 2 whole make A=wrong numerator feel more obviously error when converting properly to simplify.
