Explanation: This question is subtly testing whether students multiply the coefficients correctly when both terms are negative. The terms being multiplied are -1 and -4.

The key insight is that weaker students often struggle with "negative times negative" concepts and may default to just looking at the magnitude (4) rather than applying the multiplication. Many will incorrectly choose -4 (B) because they're only thinking about the "4" they're dealing with, forgetting that negative × negative = positive.

More advanced students might second-guess themselves, wondering if "terms" could include coefficients and constants, leading some to 3p × -4 scenarios in their head before settling on the simple product. But the straightforward interpretation favors +4 as correct, which most reasonably proficient students will get right, especially since the question points explicitly in terms to the numbered values with minus signs, making it clear they're multiplying just the -with-minus scenario.

Surprisingly few will move from correct calculations, but a few will stumble over the negative × negative confusion rather than moving to their next option. A surprising subset of mid-range students will over-math and overwork the issue mentally or in doubt and stick instead of trusting simple signed multiplication of -1 × -4 = +4.
