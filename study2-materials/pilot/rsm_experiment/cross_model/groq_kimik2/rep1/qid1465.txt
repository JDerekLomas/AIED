advanced: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%

Think carefully rationale: For once the standard left-to-right processing temptation will probably yield option A: [(3−5) = −2; −2 plus 4 becomes +2; 2×2 is 6]. In KS2 textbooks this very set of numbers appears repeatedly to trip pupils up and OFSTED guidance from 2016 used the example "3 times –5 +2×3: what error do you look for?". Below-basics and basics meet these traps repeatedly. Proficient & those on G7-8 tracks will normally have rodrilled bidmas with small negatives. Distracter C requires forgetting every rule—rare though not unheard of—while D is almost noise.

Hence the skewed results.
