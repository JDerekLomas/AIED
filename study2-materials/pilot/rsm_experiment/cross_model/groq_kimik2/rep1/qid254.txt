Looking at this question carefully, I need to consider whether students would realistically make errors here.

The key insight is that while forgetting the 0 in the mean calculation is a known misconception the "missing zero" error, this particular question makes that mistake very obvious because:
- Option A clearly shows only 4 numbers added (missing 0)
- The 0 appears prominently at the start of the sequence
- There are exactly 5 numbers listed

Most students, even weaker ones, should notice that you're not using all the given numbers if you choose A or C. Option B shows fundamental misunderstanding of order of operations - that would only appeal to very confused students.

The presence of 0 in the first position also makes it hard to forget, unlike if it was buried somewhere in the middle.

Here's my prediction:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=15% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=8% C=5% D=82%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=2% D=93%
