**Thought Process:**

1. **Understanding the Misconception:** The most common error here is students misapplying the division of fractions. Some might incorrectly divide 12 by 3 instead of dividing the fraction \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3. However, the numbers are small and the operation is straightforward (divide both sides by 3), which reduces the likelihood of this error.

2. **Key Challenge:** The equation is simple: \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\). Students only need to divide the fraction by 3. The trap might be in miswriting the answer (e.g., inverting the fraction or miscalculating \(\frac{1}{12} \div 3\)), but it's not a steep conceptual cliff.

3. **Efficiency of Wrong Answers:** Option A, \(\frac{1}{4}\), is the "3 ÷ 12 naïve split"; Option C, 4, suggests inverting division (treating it as dividing by \(\frac{1}{3}\)); while Option D looks more as being related to 3 and 9 squaring, not applicable.

4. **Likelihood of Correct Calc:** The actual correct answer is easily within reach since \(\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{36}\). Students proficient enough not to invert wrong denominator usually breeze through; weaker at fraction operations might choose any incorrect option because none of distractors appears more tempting than others.

**Predicted Choices:**

For very lowest attainers who may not proceed past recognition error: scattered random wrongness leaning heavier towards \(1/36\) due in part to it being an offered answer.
Most intermediate groups manage by trial/error; high attainers recognize at a glance.
Only strong misapplication would attract choice of A or C.
