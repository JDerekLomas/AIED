Looking at this question, I need to think about what might trip up students working with y = 3x² when x = 0.3.

The standard calculation is straightforward: y = 3 × (0.3)² = 3 × 0.09 = 0.27

But decimal multiplication involving very few digits can be counterintuitively hard for students. This looks simple, but there are some classic errors:

1. Students might multiply decimals wrongly: doing 3 × 0.3 = 0.9 instead of squaring (and interestingly 0.81 is option A, close but not justifiable)
   
2. Students confuse squaring 0.3 with doubling: calculating (0.3 × 2) instead but they wouldn't write 2.7 with extra wrong shifting (D looks more like simple addition error)

3. A common real decimal error is missing decimal movement completely by treating them almost correctly for basic maths which they often just double multiply digits straight across for decimals

However, most able kids here tend to nail decimal arithmetic when they have memorized place-move. What is crucial is most lower abilities can do squared decimals in the 3x format even with errors since the process itself remains well rehearsed pattern recognition especially after seeing repeated decimals squaring.

The numbers chosen are such that most miscast multiplication error leads to non-available answers, so guessing or wrong methods often hit B anyway by fluke.
What this question isn't is a sneaky conceptual misconception setter (this is almost basic arithmetic rather algebra)

I therefore don't see huge variation by actual misconceptions versus careful arithmetic in the end result:

below_basic: A=7% B=38% C=18% D=22%
basic: A=10% C=29% D=12% B=47%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=9% D=7%
advanced: A=2% B=87% C=9% D=4%
