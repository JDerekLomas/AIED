Looking at this equation, I need to consider the common misconceptions students have with algebraic fractions and division.

The key traps here are:
1. Students confusing \(\frac{5}{p}\) with \(\frac{p}{5}\)
2. The conceptual leap needed to make 'p' the subject
3. The decimal in option A which might suggest 0.5 is "half" without checking

This is a relatively straightforward algebra question with a subtle setup. Students need to multiply both sides by p, recognize they're solving for p, and avoid the fraction flip error.
