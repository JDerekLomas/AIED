Looking closely at this question, it's actually rather simple despite initial appearance. The equation is 10x - 6y = 30 and we need to find x when y = 0.5.

Let me work through the calculation:
10x - 6(0.5) = 30
10x - 3 = 30
10x = 33
x = 3.3

Here are the subtle difficulty factors:
- The coefficient 10 multiplies by y = 0.5, which simplifies the first step nicely
- Having a decimal answer might make some students freeze unnecessarily
- The multiple choice options include plausible results (4.25 from getting x+y=30-6.5 wrong)

For the lowest achieving students (who struggle even with substitution):
Below the key factor is basic computational ability and maintaining negative signs (6.5 being subtracted)
Many students forget the minus sign on the y/position coefficients, leading straight for y negative incorrectly producing either positive 3.3 or sign change

Actually working through examples on questions like this:
Below_basic level students - 60%+ would pick -4.x or +4.x numbers
Proficient - would have basic errors on operations/signs

Overall though because the decimals (especially 0.5 × ...) remove arithmetic load, this problem is more straightforward.

basic: A=30% B=35% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=65% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
