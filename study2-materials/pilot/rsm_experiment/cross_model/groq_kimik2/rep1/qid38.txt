Looking at this question carefully, I need to consider how students at different ability levels would approach \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\).

The key insight is identifying whether to use 2x or 2/ x² when finding a common denominator.

Here's my analysis:

**Below Basic students:** These students often can't find common denominators properly. Many will just add numerators (3+4=7) and somehow combine denominators, making option B (\(\frac{7}{3x}\)) seem appealing.

**Basic students:** These typically remember common denominators but make mistakes. Since x goes into both terms, they'll find correctly that the LCD is 2x. However, they may forget to adjust the second numerator correctly (\(\frac{4}{4}×2x\)). This leads to option D having the right denominator but wrong numerator.

**Proficient students:** Most will handle this correctly once they find the LC LCD=2x and write \(\frac{3+8}{2x} \)\(frac{11}{2x}\)\.

**Advanced students:** This should be routine - almost instant recognition that the answer must be A.

below_basic: A=15% B=35% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=10% D<1>
advanced: A=9*% B=2% C<1> D=&lt;1%</intuitive>
