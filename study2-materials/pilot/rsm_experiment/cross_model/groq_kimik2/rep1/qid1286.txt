### Predicted Response Patterns

**Below Basic:**  
These students often struggle with rearranging formulas involving powers/roots. Commonly mis-remember the sphere formula or misplace π. Without π, many randomly guess a denominator, often landing on '3' regardless. D) with the lone cube-root outside might look "simpler", reinforcing the trap.  
A =5%  B =25%  C =20%  D =50%

**Basic:**  
They can usually start from the correct formula for volume of sphere (likely memorise *something like* "V = fraction with (4/3)" but cannot reliably isolate the root in presence of a fraction or π in the denominator. Still often try "π goes anywhere but the root" or drop π from numerator entirely (B). A and D are attractive because numerator doesn't look odd or a different radical placement mis-ads direction. A) or B) or D appear 'cleaner'.  
A =25%  B =35%  C =20%  D =20%

**Proficient:**  
Know 3/4V gives r³ by rearrangement; most have successfully moved constants across and know π should be on the divisor in bracket expression. Few still hold misconception of leaving it topside (B mostly): occasional algebra slip by a tiny few. Still sometimes mis-type radical sign placement, but a fair majority correctly arrive at proper formula variant in C (slightly more accurate algebraic form). Remind of cube root step.  
A =10%  B =20%  C =50%  D =20%

**Advanced:**  
Confident mastery; comfortable rearranging algebra to derive sphere or checking rearrangement fast using substitute number check r from V = … in C consistently seen more natural form without common inversion errors present as a major hold-up misconception option elsewhere. Errors usually trivial slip on a sign/power, or minor distractor D as they know B/C/A all have cube-root correctly but C is correct. 75%+ C, very slight scattered in others largely minor inattention (occasional 'speed-run' errors: B because inverted fraction, or A left π un-cleared in their head fast). Most reliably pick correct.  
A =5%  B =10%  C =80%  D =5%
