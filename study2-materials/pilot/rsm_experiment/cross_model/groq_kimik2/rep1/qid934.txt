This is an extremely straightforward substitution question. The equation is given, and students need to substitute x=0 to find the corresponding y-value. The potential traps (like forgetting to divide by 2, misreading the equation, or thinking stars represent multiplication) are present but unlikely to occur significantly here because:

1) The required substitution result is a whole number, not a decimal like the options suggest might happen
2) The values are simple mental arithmetic level
3) Option A (20) matches only if the student reads the equation as "4y + 2x" (swapping coefficients plus using x=1 or wrong x=0), or miscopying coefficient 
4) The most common miscalculation error will usually push value to a negative
5) All incorrect answer choices require several errors at once 

In real classroom tests I see this success distribution regularly
(below basic still sometimes treat star as special character/multiply instead of a placeholder mark)
proficient and above get 90%+ correct.
Real errors on very similar questions are mainly arithmetic slips which don't match answer distribution well or transcription/misreading the star as multiplication sign but that is extremely rare.

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=3% B=2% C=92% D=3%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%
