Looking at this question, I need to consider what common errors students make with negative numbers raised to even/explicit exponents.

The key trap here is option B: -81 and option D: -12, which test two different negative sign placement confusions:
- Some students may compute the value as 81, but fail to see the negative sign placement needs
- Others may confuse the index as belonging only to 3 instead of negative 3. But writing "(-3)4 = ..." is a very rare error for this item due to how clearly structured the equation and substitution notation appears before any student.

Given such a clear substitution where most students understand we substitute (-3), not just 3, the vast majority will evaluate a positive result by rule of (-3)×(−3)××(-3)×(-3) as positive result.

So this particular item actually avoids the key error being tested. A surprising proportion gain the item right despite the existence of options tempting one way of looking it as negative. Most confusion is between the operations of multiplication and indices than placement ambiguity for these specific question types.

Here my estimates:

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=18% D=7%
proficient: A=88% B=5% C=6% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1%
