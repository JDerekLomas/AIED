Let me break down what happens with this question.

The key challenge here is substituting correctly and then solving 10x - 6(0.5) = 30. This simplifies to 10x - 3 = 30.
From there, students need to:
1. Add 3 to both sides (10x = 33)
2. Divide by 10 (x = 3.3)

The decimal 0.5 in combination with the subtraction creates the main cognitive challenge. At that point you get either 32 or 37 (the - or + 3 error) when trying to isolate the x-term, depending on whether the 0.5 and subtraction step happened correctly. That’s crucial: A correct 12-year-old who has just learned rearranging is more bothered about collecting constant terms first before isolating x, but here an integer and a unit-place decimal mix up what used to look tidy.

Stronger students generally sail through once they’re committed to systematic substitution. Their only realistic glitch might be a trans-calculation slip, not misconception, yet even then C is obvious. Mid performers are attracted to B from "sign-confusion": they see "-3" moving over with a flip from adding to negation; because nothing else negative is in evidence it's the only tempting neg answer available. Below basic pupils panic once numbers go outside the 1-10 safe zone and start to divide the wrong term, so random option spread rises but there's very little pull toward option C—unless they truly lucked into it through calculator typing and didn't have any systematic way to check.

With typical class-room experience the percentage outcome looks roughly like:

below_basic: A=20 B=35 C=18 D=27  
basic: A=5 B=30 C=53 D=12  
proficient: A=2 B=8 C=85 D=5  
advanced: A=1 B=3 C=94 D=2
