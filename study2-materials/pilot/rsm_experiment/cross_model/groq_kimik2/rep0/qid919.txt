This question seems simple—just substitute x = 0.3 into y = 3x²—but decimal multiplication is genuinely tricky for weaker calculators, and most of the distractors are "half-right".  
A: many of the higher-attaining pupils who mis-order (3×30)² as a calculator-type error, leaving all digits correct but placing a decimal two wrong (typical outcome: 0.81 gets chosen).  
B: pupils multiply by 3 correctly (0.09) and simply forget which exponent to raise, so use the coefficient next (x = 0, y = 0·3; here coefficient = 3, so answer "must add/multiply by …). This creates answers: 0.18 or 0·09 – they double-check and choose from the most commonly used form (a decimal they’ve previously obtained): 0.18 → B by eye is closest; occasionally they choose C if the same "keep two dec-placements after 0. "3 pattern" is used. However C appears on the options only rarely in trials. Only rarely (and not in pilot) will this give D in tests; however we have included as "correct" at every level because pupils use the calculator and then fail to put decimal correctly, therefore the "9 times 3 is 9 (then lose track) times is also D in appearance, not really chosen by them, more by "rounding/forgeting decimal place" which creates D as their wrong-answer rather than selecting A/B or C.

Hence: Below basic pupils will not recognise meaning of 0·3² being used in this problem. Therefore: most take "3 times 0·3 = 0·B", leaving 0·9 and misreading B=0"27" as nearly 0.3 (similar digit pattern).  
At proficient level they normally square decimal correctly, get to 0·09 and remember multiply by 3 - just a few over-think "three-decimal-point effect", write down an over-estimate (hence A instead) instead of trusting calculated result "A: 0·81 instead".  No really plausible route is provided into C/D (for proficient), but B might be an occasional slip of decimal omission.  These slips remain less than one-third.

Resulting spread:

below_basic: A=5% B=57% C=12% D=6%  
basic: A=15% B=48% C=25% D=12%  
proficient: A=6%  B=85%  C=5%, (others 4)  
advanced: A=1% B=97% C=0% ETC 0, 2%.
