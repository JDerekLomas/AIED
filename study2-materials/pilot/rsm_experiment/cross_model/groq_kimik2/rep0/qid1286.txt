The key challenge here is recognising and correctly manipulating the volume formula V = (4/3)πr³, especially under the additional pressure that r appears inside the cubed bracket - leading most students either to multiply (rather than divide) by 3 instead of 4 inside the cube root, or to mis-match (or omit) π to one side or the other. Hence most partial or uncertain thinkers will drop the wrong '4' (hence option D) or mis-divide by three/four together, whereas only confident calculators will complete the rearrangement precisely.
