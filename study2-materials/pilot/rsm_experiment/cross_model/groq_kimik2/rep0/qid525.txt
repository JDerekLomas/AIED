Think carefully explanation:
The traps here are minimal compared to many fraction questions. Students don't need to worry about improper fractions or simplifying, and the context is addition (easier than subtraction/division). The denominators 4 and 10 don't trigger confusion because 1/4 is familiar and 7/10 works neatly as 4/20. Option D gives the classic but very recognizable cross-add-error for wrong denominators. Low attainers will mainly worry about the conversion process and may pick unfinished work as an answer (A or C - fraction without conversion / common denominator mistake, or not converted to mixed format); they make calculation mistakes instead of conceptual misconceptions about fractions themselves. Most intermediate+ pupils arrive reliably at the conversion. Advanced learners virtually all avoid the simple fraction traps.

Only low ability pupils make a dent in results here - because it's a routine calculation process issue, not one about misunderstood concepts.
