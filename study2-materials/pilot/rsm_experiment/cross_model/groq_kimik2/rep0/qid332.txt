Let me analyze whether real students would genuinely err on this specific instance.

**Key psychological trap analysis:**
- Katie's *54* as intermediate product before ×3 is an uncommon structure, but
- If they treat − 5 literally like Tom has (so simply add 5) is far cleaner
- Neither child's suggestion carries the most frequent solving-a-step trap that is to
forget one gets the unknown BEFORE isolating it; in other respects the
equation's look matches perfectly well what students always work on in KS3

**Therefore:**
- Most kids spot that Tom added the five and hence can go for the only-Tom tick—often a rapid visual subtraction
- A subset of pupils do in passing wonder 5 → ×3 must equal *35*, thereby discounting Katie rather than accepting hers, before proceeding toward *A* (rather than *C or B*). The structure of the problem thus produces the wrong option mostly on a visual subtraction; not deep misunderstanding.
