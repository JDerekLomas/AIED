Reasoning: Below-basic students often "forget the zero" because they don't see it as a "real" number, and their primary error is dividing by the wrong count. Basic students improve but still get tripped by the order of operations (thinking of 15÷5 rather than ÷5 on the whole sum), making B very tempting since the "15÷5 math part" feels correct. Proficient pupils usually spot the need for division-by-5, yet still get distracted by option-C thinking mode "ignore outliers/information you can discard from a list of five numbers", so about one in six keep four in the dividend. Only one student in twelve among proficient ones slips on missing the total (still omitting a "zero" addend). Higher-attainers have no trouble summing the numbers themselves, spotting a "full set of numbers equals mean when equally weighted", and choosing the correct answer with near complete accuracy. This small data-set with a zero is the key source of error rather than general misconceptions or BODMAS in advanced writers, whose few "B" ticks come from casual reading glances over "÷5 as an implied end denominator".
