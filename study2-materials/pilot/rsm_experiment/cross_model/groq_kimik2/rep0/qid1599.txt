What makes the question easy:
- The expression in question has a + sign. When students know only part of an expression will be in denominators, they write brackets.
  Here option A keeps the brackets. They have learned that anything "together" needs bracketing. There is no temptation like “no-priority” operators.” (No ×) so 1/h+4 miswriting doesn't surface.)
- All other choices have changes either inside brackets, top and bottom or swap the operation in an easy to spot way. These are big deviations so the correct choice doesn't “need subtle” pattern recognition.

What traps exist and for whom:
A sizeable minority of ‘basic-level’ pupils still do not distinguish “one term from operation”, so some pick C (misinterpreting division applies only to h). Above-basic but not proficient pupils mostly just self-check they left the brackets in-tact rather than reverse (that is why very small pick D) hence almost no top-quartile students choose incorrect items but almost every higher-attainer simply sees brackets => pick A. Few high-attainers are thrown off – the context is simply too obvious to trigger the “missing brackets” misconception at this stage where KS4 have by now seen ‘single-line fraction’ convention in many topics. All statistics show clear separation between upper half & the two lower prior-attainment groups.
