This question is trickier than it appears. The key snag is students not understanding that a negative number raised to an even power stays hidden after evaluation, meaning all visible digits will be positive.

- **Option C** represents the *real-product* sign error that many students show even after meeting squaring many times. A common line: "Minus three and a power, the result must be negative." A non-zero number of these pupils will write C.
- **Option B & D** are random-ish answers. Multiply the base (often in the low single digits) to try to make T a tiny number.
- **None would pick A** who cannot evaluate powers or apply the sign law. Students who do work this example out rarely misclassify it. Below-basic group might still be just below working the expression rather than applying it incorrectly.

Overall it is still reasonably fair: very able pupils won’t find cause to hesitate, middle tier pupils who think  (−)⁴=− rather than + will drop the mark here, bottom tier pupils won’t know powers from addition.

Predicted responses: 81% top, majority C from mid–ability, mixed at Below-basic.

below_basic: A=4%, B=26%, C=31%, D=36%
