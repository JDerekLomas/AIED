Looking at this algebra question, I need to consider what errors students actually make with algebraic fractions.

The calculation: 3/(2x) + 4/x = 3/(2x) + 8/(2x) = 11/(2x)

Key insights:
- This requires finding a common denominator of 2x
- 4/x becomes 8/2x (not just staying as 4/2x)
- Students often get the adding numerator part right once denominators match

**Below basic level**: Half can't combine fractions at all, leaving answers split between A and C (common choice when just manipulating given numbers) rather than attempting proper algebraic combining. Most haven't developed even these misconception patterns yet.

**Basic level**: Those with algebra familiarity can attempt but still hit fundamental barriers. Rough proportions guess at ability to handle denominators, not numerators.

**Proficient students**: Usually confident with adding rational expressions, making this mostly straightforward even with fractions needing careful management; mistakes happen but most are successful.

**Advanced**: Near-instant, reliable on this sort of standard construction task, unless carereading slips.

below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=25% D=45%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=0% D=20%
advanced: A=85% B=5% C=0% D=10%
