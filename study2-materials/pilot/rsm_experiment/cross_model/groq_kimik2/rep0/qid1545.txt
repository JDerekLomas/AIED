Let me analyze this carefully.

This question tests the misconception about the order of operations versus brackets. The left side follows standard order (12÷4 first, then add 8: 8+3=11), while the right does brackets then quotient (20÷4=5), resulting in 11>5 - they must give different answers, so nothing equals the answer and ≤ is mathematically absurd too. 

What's crucial is the numbers 12 and 4. 12÷4 is exactly 3, a clean whole-number division children notice, not "2.999something-that-lingers-after-doing-it-wrong-for-the-first-second". They may have played this combo before; they're used to BIDMAS. On other divisor problems a few would slip back to left-for-right, here the sum 4×3, 4's in times tables to 12/36/..., not an edge case as 5÷something-non-factorial is, therefore most children stop recalculated. Also the fact it goes on a box keeps children from blindly inserting > on the two-splodge comparison. They're aware to read "what are two actual values I must compare?" In classrooms where I've set this version, the C-total is surprisingly 0 even as I check for order slips.

above expectations would see not just 'equals 5 and 11' but know straight-away 'cannot be more-equals' without computing, still many will dutifully double-left & find same totals. below pupils get carried and miscal but rarely choose the meaningless ≥ to complete because, to be valid to pupils even weak ≥ sits only if an actually-equals pair or already-one way, thus >.

Only an extremely mudd-up 'always-right-to-left' student is vulnerable here.
