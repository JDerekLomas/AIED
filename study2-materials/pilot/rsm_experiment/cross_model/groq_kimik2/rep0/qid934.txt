Looking at this question, I need to analyze what traps students might fall into with this specific table setup.

The key thing here is that the star appears in the position for y when x=0. This creates a subtle but important situation:

Most students would correctly substitute x=0 into the equation 4x + 2y = 10, getting 2y = 10, so y = 5. This is quite a straightforward substitution so most would follow this method.

However, this creates multiple choice chaos because:
- Option A (20) might trap the quick but careless - perhaps confusing coefficients
- Options B/D trap students who solve for x but forget to find y
- Option C (5) is the correct answer

The unusual row format for just two data values actually minimizes mistakes - there's only one reasonable "star" position which focuses attention directly. Unlike multi-input substitution tables where confusion reign from poor spacing, this targeted blank question guides students to do the right calculation almost by reflex once they notice what equals zero: any uncertainty quickly resolves to option C for the numerically cautious.

Unlike the horror-table setup used by some UK boards with four different gaps needing five substitution steps at different points simultaneously (students filling two answers into the wrong cells, using horizontal data instead of following logical progression through rows, or getting coefficients swapped each iteration), this format provides gentle guidance on where to look for the missing information. The obvious physical layout reinforces correct procedure naturally without triggering decision paralysis from too many empty boxes begging multiple simultaneous solutions: students typically work this easily without needing conscious strategy.

Final distribution:

**below_basic**: C will pick up at least half, as even the shakiest remember zero-substitution rules here.

- A=10% B=10% C=55% D=25%
  
**basic**: Slightly better recall/execution, though some careless slips persist.

- A=5% B=5% C=75% D=15%

(**Notes**: "basic" here means working-around-Level-3, not those totally lost—they recognize needing to substitute x=0 properly. Any substitution gets done much quicker at this standard—drives up C rates significantly relative to random distribution on simpler multi-blank table question versions.)

**proficient**: Strong method recognition from frequent practice at simultaneous equations. Nearly all will get C quickly.

- A=1% B=1% C=87% D=11%

(Even one "missing-zero" careless slips are rare with these numbers so neat/simple format focuses their arithmetic vigilance strongly. Higher levels of confidence usually pick through working systematically first and back-check less.)

**advanced**: Very nearly all correct here now—the zero-x trap here feels straightforward compared with nasty rearrangement/confusing contexts many see regularly in lessons/extension. Still, perfection being human, ~8% trip with D somehow mistaking 2y or similar basic mishap from rushing at the final multiple-ans.

- A=1% B=0% C=89% D=10%

Essentially: straightforward arithmetic context/ layout gives no major misconception traction even among weaker peers (the numbers line up too neatly): even 'below basic' can navigate reasonably well (despite occasional sign swap/rearrange mix-up still). The trap set actually works poorly here for discriminating lower ability – but higher ability gain relatively stable reliable selection in this focused version which tests what was probably already securely understood (rather than revealing their thinking through real error opportunity elsewhere).
