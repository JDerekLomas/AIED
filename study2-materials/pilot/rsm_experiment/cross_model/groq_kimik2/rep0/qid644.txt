This question is asking students to identify the product of (-1) × (-4) within the context of expanding brackets. While it's testing negative × negative = positive, the numbers involved are simple and direct - no coefficients to multiply, no signs to keep track of beyond the integers themselves.

Below-basic students who haven't grasped that two negatives make a positive would still get -4, making B appealing despite it requiring an understanding they lack.

Basic students would likely get this right since "negative times negative" is a basic building blocks they drill repeatedly though may occasionally forget when rushed.

Higher-attaining students should find this straightforward even when presented in a mild distractor environment where it's 'hidden' in context.

below_basic: A=30% B=45% C=15% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=8% C=4% D=3%
advanced: A=92% B=4% C=3% D=1%
