This question is tricky because although BOMDAS is well-known, the second part with only additions/subtractions catches students out. The left-to-right rule for operations of equal precedence is often forgotten. Students will apply BOMDAS to both calculations, choosing P:4-5 (left thinking of substraction=smaller=more important, forgetting P only has left-to-right reading). More than 40% go for optionA thinking both left-right, missing the order rule but correct on subtraction before addition in problem A. The biggest pull is B since stronger students know the X for Q but do the same operation left-right on P. Most confident A2 students spot the catch using pure BOMDAS rules perfectly, giving the correct operations B.

Students who answer A have grasped reading left-to-right is relevant, but failed on BOMDAS, selecting 4+5 for the multiplication problem. They pick B (or even C) more than A because 'multiply first', the mantra learned over right-to-left or vice versa, pulls them that way. D occurs less - to do that they have to jump operations incorrectly in P.
