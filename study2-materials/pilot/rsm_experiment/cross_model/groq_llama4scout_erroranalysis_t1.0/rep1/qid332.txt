## Step 1: Analyzing the question and possible errors
The question requires students to solve the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) and evaluate the correctness of two proposed next lines of working: \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\) by Tom, and \(x - 5 = 36\) by Katie.

## 2: Evaluating Tom's proposal
Tom's proposal is \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). To check if this is a correct next step, we add 5 to both sides of the original equation: \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5\), which simplifies to \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This is a correct algebraic manipulation.

## 3: Evaluating Katie's proposal
Katie's proposal is \(x - 5 = 36\). To see if this is correct, we multiply every term in the original equation by 3 to clear the fraction: \(x - 15 = 36\). Katie's step seems to misunderstand the operation; correctly multiplying by 3 should yield \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\). The correct multiplication by 3 gives \(x - 15 = 36\), indicating Katie's proposal as presented is incorrect because she didn't properly account for multiplying the -5 by 3.

## 4: Identifying calculation errors and attractive wrong methods
- Tom's method is correct and straightforward.
- Katie's error involves misunderstanding the algebraic manipulation. A common mistake would be not multiplying the constant term by 3 when multiplying every term by 3, leading to \(x - 5 = 36\) instead of the correct \(x - 15 = 36\).

## 5: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulations. They might choose D) Neither is correct because they can't validate either statement or might incorrectly validate Katie's due to a lack of understanding of the operations.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand simple additions and subtractions but struggle with validating algebraic steps. They might be attracted to Katie's seemingly simple multiplication but could also see Tom's as correct. Errors in calculation or misunderstanding of algebraic rules might lead them to choose B) Only Katie or D) Neither is correct.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily see Tom's step as correct. They might be tricked into thinking Katie's could be correct if they misinterpret the algebraic manipulation but are more likely to identify Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrectness, leading to A) Only Tom.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level will clearly see Tom's proposal as correct and understand why Katie's is incorrect (due to not multiplying -5 by 3), thus choosing A) Only Tom.

## 6: Estimating percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (understand Tom but struggle with Katie), B=20% (think Katie's right), C=10% (think both are right), D=40% (think neither).
- **Basic**: A=50%, B=25%, C=10%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: A=95%, B=0%, C=0%, D=5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
