## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks for the product of the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## 2: Identify the correct answer
The correct answer is \(+4\), which corresponds to option A.

## 3: Analyze potential calculation errors for each wrong answer
- Option B (\(-4\)): This would result from \((-1) \times 4\) or \(1 \times (-4)\), which are not relevant here but indicate a misunderstanding of the signs.
- Option C (\(+5\)): This doesn't directly result from a simple multiplication error of \(-1\) and \(-4\), suggesting it might come from a more complex mistake or confusion with other parts of the expansion.
- Option D (\(-5\)): Similar to option C, it doesn't directly result from multiplying \(-1\) and \(-4\), indicating a potential miscalculation or confusion.

## 4: Consider "attractive" errors
- A common error could be forgetting the rule that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result. Students might mistakenly think \(-1 \times -4 = -5\) (option D) because they incorrectly apply the rule or make a simple arithmetic mistake.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand the basic rules of multiplying negative numbers or might make simple arithmetic errors. They could choose B, C, or D due to a lack of understanding or careless mistakes. Given the simplicity of the question, a significant portion might choose the obviously incorrect options due to not following the rules of multiplication of negatives.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make careless errors. They are less likely to choose C or D, as these require more complex errors, but might still opt for B if they misunderstand the sign rule.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the rules and are less likely to make simple arithmetic mistakes. They should predominantly choose A, with a small percentage possibly choosing B due to a momentary lapse in understanding the sign rule.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly unlikely to make errors in simple multiplications like this and should nearly all choose A.

## 6: Estimate percentages
Given the nature of the errors and assuming a normal distribution of understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some get it right by chance or basic understanding), B=20% (simple error), C=10% (random/guess), D=30% (common mistake).
- **Basic**: A=70% (understand the concept but might make minor errors), B=15% (occasional mistake), C=5% (unlikely), D=10% (some still struggle with the concept).
- **Proficient**: A=90% (strong understanding), B=5% (rare mistake), C=2% (very unlikely), D=3% (unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=98% (almost certain), B=1% (extremely rare), C=0.5% (very unlikely), D=0.5% (very unlikely).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
