## Step 1: Understand the question and the possible errors
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct answer can be found using the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last), which yields \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\). Let's analyze the possible errors for each wrong option.

## 2: Analyze option A: \(m^{2}-2 m-35\)
To get \(m^{2}-2 m-35\), a student might incorrectly apply the FOIL method, resulting in \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35\), but then mistakenly simplify it further or incorrectly combine terms, which doesn't directly lead to A. A more likely mistake for A is not applying FOIL correctly but getting a simple subtraction error: \(m^2 - 5m - 7m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\), then incorrectly subtracting 35 from \(m^2 - 12m\) to get \(-35\), which actually leads to \(m^2 - 12m - 35\). However, another common mistake could be \(m^2 - 7m + 5m - 35 = m^2 - 2m - 35\), suggesting a confusion in signs.

## 3: Analyze option C: \(m^{2}+12 m+35\)
For \(m^{2}+12 m+35\), a student might add the terms instead of subtracting, leading to \(m^2 + 7m + 5m + 35 = m^2 + 12m + 35\). This mistake involves incorrectly changing the signs of the terms when multiplying.

## 4: Analyze option D: \(m^{2}-12 m-35\)
Option D, \(m^{2}-12 m-35\), could result from correctly applying FOIL to get \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\), then mistakenly changing the \(+35\) to \(-35\), which is a simple arithmetic error.

## 5: Consider student ability levels and common mistakes
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to make significant errors, including not following the FOIL method correctly, misinterpreting signs, or making basic arithmetic mistakes. They might choose A or D due to simple arithmetic errors or sign mistakes.
- **Basic**: Basic level students might understand the FOIL method but apply it inaccurately or make simple mistakes. They could opt for A due to misinterpreting the subtraction of terms or for D due to a mistake in the constant term.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students are likely to apply the FOIL method correctly but might make occasional errors. They are less likely to choose A or C but might still select D if they mistakenly change the sign of the constant term.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are expected to apply the FOIL method accurately and are less likely to make errors. They should predominantly choose B.

## 6: Estimate percentages based on common errors and student ability
Given the analysis, let's estimate:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple mistakes, e.g., \(m^2 - 2m - 35\)), B=20% (some understanding but errors), C=20% (adding instead of subtracting), D=30% (error in constant term).
- **Basic**: A=25% (misapplication of FOIL), B=40% (mostly correct but occasional errors), C=15% (incorrectly adding terms), D=20% (simple arithmetic mistake).
- **Proficient**: A=10% (occasional mistake), B=80% (accurate application of FOIL), C=5% (rare mistake), D=5% (simple error).
- **Advanced**: A=2% (rare error), B=95% (accurate), C=1% (very rare mistake), D=2% (simple mistake).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
