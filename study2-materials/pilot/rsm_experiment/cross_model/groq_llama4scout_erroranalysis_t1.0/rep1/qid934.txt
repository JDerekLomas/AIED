## Step 1: Understand the question and the table of values
The table of values is for the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\). We need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\), which is represented by \(\color{gold}\bigstar \).

## 2: Solve for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
To find \(y\) when \(x = 0\), substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\).
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]
\[y = 5\]

## 3: Identify the correct answer
The correct answer is \(C = 5\), as \(y = 5\) when \(x = 0\).

## 4: Analyze potential calculation errors for each wrong answer
- \(A = 20\): This could result from \(4x + 2y = 10\) becoming \(2y = 10 \times 4 = 40\) when \(x = 0\), incorrectly solving for \(y\) gives \(y = 20\).
- \(B = 3\): This might come from a miscalculation or incorrect substitution, such as \(4(0) + 2y = 10\) leading to \(2y = 6\) (perhaps due to a mistake in handling the equation), resulting in \(y = 3\).
- \(D = 2.5\): This could come from \(2y = 5\) (incorrectly dividing 10 by 2 and not accounting for the \(4x\) term properly), giving \(y = 2.5\).

## 5: Consider which errors are attractive and who might fall into each trap
- Lower ability students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and could easily fall into traps like \(A = 20\) or \(B = 3\) due to simple arithmetic mistakes.
- The error leading to \(D = 2.5\) might seem less likely as it involves a correct division but an incorrect equation handling.
- More proficient students are less likely to make basic arithmetic errors but might still struggle if they misunderstand the equation.

## 6: Estimate the percentage of students at each ability level choosing each option
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to make significant errors. \(A = 20\) seems like a plausible mistake due to over-multiplication. \(B = 3\) and \(D = 2.5\) could result from confusion or incorrect calculations. \(C = 5\) seems less likely for this group.
- **Basic**: This group might still make some errors but are more likely to understand basic algebra. They might choose \(B = 3\) or \(D = 2.5\) due to minor calculation mistakes.
- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to get it right or make less obvious mistakes. They might choose \(A = 20\) if they misunderstand the substitution.
- **Advanced**: This group is least likely to make errors and should mostly choose \(C = 5\).

## 7: Predict percentages based on typical student performance
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (overestimation), B=25% (simple mistake), C=20% (some get it right), D=25% (another type of mistake).
- **Basic**: A=15%, B=20%, C=50% (most get it right), D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=80%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
