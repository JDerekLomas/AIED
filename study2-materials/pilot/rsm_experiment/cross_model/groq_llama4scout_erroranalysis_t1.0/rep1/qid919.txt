## Step 1: Understand the question and the equation given
The equation provided is $y = 3x^2$, and we need to find the value of $y$ when $x = 0.3$. The correct calculation is $y = 3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

## 2: Identify the wrong answers and potential calculation errors
- Option A: $0.81$ could result from $3 \times 0.3^2 = 3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$, but then possibly miscalculated or incorrect transcription.
- Option B: $0.27$ is the correct answer.
- Option C: $1.8$ could result from $3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$, implying a possible mistake where $0.3^2 = 0.6$ instead of $0.09$.
- Option D: $2.7$ could result from $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$, suggesting $0.3^2 = 0.9$ instead of $0.09$.

## 3: Analyze the errors and student likely hood to make them
- The error leading to $0.81$ seems less straightforward and might involve a miscalculation or a confusion with another part of the question.
- The error leading to $1.8$ suggests a misunderstanding of squaring $0.3$ to get $0.6$ instead of $0.09$, which could be an attractive mistake for students not confident with decimals or squaring numbers.
- The error leading to $2.7$ suggests $0.3^2 = 0.9$, which could be due to students incorrectly calculating or estimating $0.3^2$.

## 4: Consider student ability levels and their likelihood of making errors
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic calculations and are more likely to make errors in squaring numbers and multiplying by 3. They might choose $C$ or $D$ due to simple calculation mistakes.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the concept but struggle with decimal calculations. They could easily fall into traps like $0.3^2 = 0.9$ (leading to $D$) or miscalculate $0.09 \times 3$.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to get it right but might still make careless errors. They are less likely to choose $C$ or $D$ as these involve more significant calculation mistakes.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are likely to calculate correctly and avoid simple traps.

## 5: Predict the percentages based on error analysis and student ability
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below Basic**: Likely to see high percentages in $C$ and $D$ due to basic calculation errors. $C=30%$ $D=40%$ $A=15%$ $B=15%$
- **Basic**: Might see a significant portion choosing $D$ due to the $0.3^2 = 0.9$ mistake. $B=40%$ $D=30%$ $C=15%$ $A=15%$
- **Proficient**: Should mostly choose $B$, with some possibly choosing $A$ due to careless errors. $B=80%$ $A=10%$ $C=5%$ $D=5%$
- **Advanced**: Almost all should choose $B$. $B=95%$ $A=3%$ $C=1%$ $D=1%$

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=3% B=95% C=1% D=1%
