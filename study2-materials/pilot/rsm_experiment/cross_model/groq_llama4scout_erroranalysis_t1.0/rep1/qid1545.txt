## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors
The question requires students to compare the values of two expressions: $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$. To solve this, students need to apply the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 2: Calculate the correct values of the expressions
First, calculate $8+12 \div 4$. Following BODMAS, we do the division first: $12 \div 4 = 3$. Then, $8 + 3 = 11$.

Next, calculate $(8+12) \div 4$. Following BODMAS, we do the operation in the parentheses first: $8 + 12 = 20$. Then, $20 \div 4 = 5$.

## 3: Compare the expressions and determine the correct symbol
Comparing the two results: $11$ and $5$, it's clear that $11 > 5$. Therefore, the correct symbol to use is $>$.

## 4: Analyze potential errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error is to ignore the order of operations or to misapply it. For example, calculating $8 + 12 \div 4$ as $20 \div 4 = 5$ (which is incorrect because it incorrectly groups the numbers).
- Another error could be evaluating both expressions as if they were equal or assuming one is always greater without calculation.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option
- **Below Basic**: These students often lack understanding of basic mathematical operations and the order of operations. They might incorrectly calculate or compare the expressions without following any rules, leading to random or intuitive guesses. Given the simplicity of the expressions, some might still guess $>$ (A) if they sense $8+12$ is larger than $12$, but many would struggle, potentially leading to a spread across options but with a bias towards $>$ (A) or $=$ (C) due to misunderstanding.

## 6: Consider the specific calculations leading to wrong answers
- For $8+12 \div 4$, if a student incorrectly calculates it as $(8+12) \div 4$, they'd get $5$, and if they think the other expression also equals $5$, they'd choose $=$ (C).
- The expression $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$ is straightforward. If students correctly calculate one but not the other or misunderstand the comparison, they might choose $<$ (B) if they think $5$ is less than $11$, which is correct but let's see the distribution.

## 7: Distribution based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (intuitive guess that $>$), B=20% (less likely but possible if they think the division makes the first expression smaller), C=40% (equating due to lack of understanding), D=10% (unlikely as it requires understanding of inequalities).
- **Basic**: A=50% (correct calculation or intuition), B=20% (some might still confuse), C=25% (still some confusion), D=5% (rare).
- **Proficient**: A=70% (correct understanding and calculation), B=10% (occasional mistake), C=15% (some might still doubt), D=5% (rare).
- **Advanced**: A=90% (clear understanding), B=5% (very rare mistake), C=4% (unlikely), D=1% (very rare).

## 8: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
- **basic**: A=50% B=20% C=25% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=90% B=5% C=4% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=4% D=1%
