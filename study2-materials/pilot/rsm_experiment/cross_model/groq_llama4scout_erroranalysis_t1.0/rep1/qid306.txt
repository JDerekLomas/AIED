## Step 1: Understanding the Problems
First, let's analyze the problems given: \( 4-5+6= \) and \( 4+5 \times 6= \). For Problem P, the calculation should follow the order of operations from left to right since there are only addition and subtraction: \( 4 - 5 + 6 \). For Problem Q, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication should be done before addition: \( 5 \times 6 \) then \( 4 + \) the result.

## 2: Identifying Correct Calculations
For Problem P, the correct order is to perform the operations from left to right: \( 4 - 5 = -1 \) then \( -1 + 6 = 5 \). So, the first calculation should indeed be \( 4 - 5 \).

For Problem Q, the correct order is to perform the multiplication first: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) then \( 4 + 30 = 34 \). So, the first calculation should indeed be \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 3: Analyzing Wrong Answers
- Option A suggests starting with \( 4-5 \) in Problem P (correct) and \( 4+5 \) in Problem Q (incorrect because multiplication should be done first).
- Option B suggests starting with \( 4-5 \) in Problem P (correct) and \( 5 \times 6 \) in Problem Q (correct).
- Option C suggests starting with \( 5+6 \) in Problem P (incorrect) and \( 4+5 \) in Problem Q (incorrect).
- Option D suggests starting with \( 5+6 \) in Problem P (incorrect) and \( 5 \times 6 \) in Problem Q (correct).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may not fully understand the order of operations. They might randomly select options or follow what seems "natural" without applying rules. Option A (\( 4-5 \) then \( 4+5 \)) might seem attractive because it involves starting with the first operation in each problem, which could feel intuitive but is incorrect for Problem Q. Option C could also be appealing for those who misunderstand the order of operations entirely. **Below Basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%**
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make errors. They are more likely to recognize the need for \( 4-5 \) in Problem P but might struggle with Problem Q. Option B seems correct but might not be chosen by those who don't apply the rules correctly. **Basic: A=20% B=50% C=20% D=10%**
- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations and are likely to choose Option B as it correctly identifies \( 4-5 \) for Problem P and \( 5 \times 6 \) for Problem Q. **Proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%**
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can also apply the rules accurately and quickly. They are most likely to choose Option B without hesitation. **Advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
