## Step 1: Understanding the task
To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, we first need to understand what each option implies and the common errors students might make.

## 2: Analyzing option A
Option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). This option suggests adding all the numbers except 0 and then dividing by 5, which is incorrect because it excludes 0 from the sum.

## 3: Analyzing option B
Option B is \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \). This option implies adding all the numbers and then dividing the last number by 5, which is also incorrect due to the incorrect order of operations.

## 4: Analyzing option C
Option C is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \). This option suggests adding all the numbers except 0 and then dividing by 4, which is incorrect because it both excludes 0 from the sum and divides by the wrong number of values.

## 5: Analyzing option D
Option D is "None of them". For this to be correct, all other options must be incorrect.

## 6: Identifying calculation errors
- Option A excludes 0 from the calculation, which is a common error if students mistakenly think 0 doesn't contribute to the sum.
- Option B incorrectly applies the order of operations, which might attract students who are not careful with mathematical operations.
- Option C incorrectly excludes 0 and divides by the wrong count, suggesting a lack of understanding of what numbers to include in the mean calculation.

## 7: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of mean or might make basic calculation errors. They are more likely to choose options that seem "easy" or align with common misconceptions. Option B might be attractive because it involves simple operations but applies them incorrectly.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make errors in applying formulas. They might choose A because it looks like a mean calculation but is missing 0, or B due to operational mistakes.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the concept of mean but might still fall into traps if they're not careful. They are less likely to choose B due to its obvious operational error but might consider A or C if they're not meticulous.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to identify that all provided calculations (A, B, C) have errors and thus choose D.

## 8: Making predictions
Given the errors and attractions:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple addition and division), B=40% (attractive due to simplicity), C=20% (easy mistake), D=10% (understanding that none are correct might be challenging).
- **Basic**: A=40% (common error excluding 0), B=30% (operational errors), C=20% (misunderstanding of count), D=10% (recognizing errors).
- **Proficient**: A=20% (error in excluding 0), B=10% (recognize operational mistake), C=10% (error in count), D=60% (correct identification).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (unlikely to make simple errors), B=0% (recognize as incorrect), C=0% (understand count), D=95% (accurately identify none as correct).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
