## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to find the radius of a sphere given its volume \(V\) cm\(^3\). The formula for the volume of a sphere is \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius. To find \(r\), the formula needs to be rearranged.

## 2: Rearranging the Volume Formula
Rearranging the formula for \(r\):
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
\[r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi}\]
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]

## 3: Identifying Correct and Incorrect Options
- The correct answer is \(C: \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\) cm.
- Option A: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V\pi}{3}}\) cm suggests a mistake where \(\pi\) is incorrectly included inside the cube root and the fraction is inverted.
- Option B: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}\) cm suggests a mistake where the \(4\) and \(3\) are swapped in relation to \(\pi\).
- Option D: \(\frac{3\sqrt[3]{V}}{4\pi}\) cm suggests a mistake where the student incorrectly took the cube root of \(V\) separately and did not properly rearrange the formula.

## 4: Analyzing Potential Errors
- **Attractive but wrong methods**: Students might find Option A attractive if they mistakenly try to solve for \(r^3 = \frac{V}{\frac{4}{3}\pi}\) and end up with an extra \(4\) and \(\pi\) inside the cube root. Option B could be chosen if students incorrectly rearrange the formula, swapping the positions of \(4\), \(3\), and \(\pi\). Option D could appeal to students who misunderstand how to isolate \(r\) and mistakenly apply operations outside the cube root.
- **Calculation Errors**: The most common error would likely involve misplacing \(\pi\), \(3\), and \(4\) within the formula. Students who are less confident might resort to guessing or applying incorrect operations.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: These students might not fully understand the formula or how to rearrange it. They are more likely to choose an option that seems simplest or most familiar, even if incorrect. Given the complexity, they might lean towards D, as it involves simple operations: \(A=10\%\), \(B=15\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=55\%\).
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of the formula but might struggle with rearranging it correctly. They might choose B, as it looks similar to the correct formula but with a plausible mistake: \(A=20\%\), \(B=30\%\), \(C=40\%\), \(D=10\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the formula and can rearrange it. However, they might still make careless mistakes. They are likely to choose A or B due to minor errors in rearrangement: \(A=30\%\), \(B=25\%\), \(C=40\%\), \(D=5\%\).
- **Advanced**: These students are confident and accurate. They should easily identify the correct formula: \(A=5\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=90\%\), \(D=0\%\).

## 6: Final Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=20% D=55%
