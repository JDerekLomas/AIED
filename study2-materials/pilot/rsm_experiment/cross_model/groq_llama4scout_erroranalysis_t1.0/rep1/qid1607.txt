To approach this question, let's first analyze the steps provided by Isaac and identify any calculation errors.

The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \).

## Step 1: Identify the correct steps
To solve the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \), we first multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which yields \( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \), simplifying to \( 60 = 1 + k \).

## 2: Solve for \( k \)
Subtract 1 from both sides to solve for \( k \): \( 60 - 1 = k \), which simplifies to \( 59 = k \).

## 3: Evaluate Isaac's steps
Isaac's Step 1: \( 60 = 1 + k \) is correct based on our calculation.
Isaac's Step 2: \( 61 = k \) is incorrect because it incorrectly adds 1 to 60, instead of subtracting 1 from 60.

## 4: Analyze the options
- A: Only step 1 is correct. This aligns with our evaluation.
- B: Only step 2 is correct. This is incorrect based on our evaluation.
- C: Both steps are correct. This is incorrect because Step 2 is wrong.
- D: Both steps are incorrect. This is incorrect because Step 1 is correct.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulation. They might see Step 1 as correct but struggle with Step 2. However, they could also incorrectly validate Step 2 due to a lack of understanding. Expect a high percentage choosing B or C because they might not identify the mistake in Step 2 or might think both are correct due to confusion. 
  - A: 20% (some recognize Step 1 is correct but not Step 2)
  - B: 30% (think only Step 2 is correct, possibly due to miscalculation)
  - C: 20% (believe both are correct, showing a lack of understanding)
  - D: 30% (recognize both are not correct, showing some level of understanding)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are likely to see Step 1 as correct but might be tricked into thinking Step 2 is correct if they don't perform the subtraction correctly.
  - A: 40% (recognize Step 1 is correct)
  - B: 25% (incorrectly think only Step 2 is correct)
  - C: 15% (think both are correct, indicating a mistake in Step 2)
  - D: 20% (see both are incorrect)

- **Proficient**: These students understand algebraic manipulations well and are less likely to make simple arithmetic errors. They should easily identify Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect.
  - A: 60% (correctly identify only Step 1 is correct)
  - B: 10% (might be a careless mistake)
  - C: 5% (unlikely to think both are correct)
  - D: 25% (some might still see both as incorrect, but this is less likely)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and are meticulous. They will accurately identify the correctness of Step 1 and the incorrectness of Step 2.
  - A: 80% (clearly see only Step 1 is correct)
  - B: 5% (a very low chance of thinking only Step 2 is correct)
  - C: 0% (will not think both are correct)
  - D: 15% (might see both steps' status correctly but choose the wrong option)

## 6: Provide the predictions in the required format
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%
