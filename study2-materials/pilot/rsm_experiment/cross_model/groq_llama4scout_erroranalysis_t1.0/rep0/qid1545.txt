## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors
The question requires students to compare the values of two expressions: \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\). To solve this, students need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 2: Calculate the correct values of the expressions
First, calculate \(8+12 \div 4\):
- \(12 \div 4 = 3\)
- \(8 + 3 = 11\)

Then, calculate \((8+12) \div 4\):
- \(8 + 12 = 20\)
- \(20 \div 4 = 5\)

So, \(8+12 \div 4 = 11\) and \((8+12) \div 4 = 5\).

## 3: Determine the correct symbol
Since \(11 > 5\), the correct symbol to use is \(>\).

## 4: Analyze potential errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error might be to ignore the order of operations or to misapply it, leading to incorrect calculations.
- For \(8+12 \div 4\), some might incorrectly calculate it as \(20 \div 4 = 5\), mistakenly applying the addition before division.
- For \((8+12) \div 4\), some might calculate it correctly as \(5\), but then compare it incorrectly to a miscalculated \(8+12 \div 4\).

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand the order of operations. They might calculate \(8+12 \div 4\) as \(20 \div 4 = 5\) (ignoring order of operations) and \((8+12) \div 4\) as \(20 \div 4 = 5\), leading them to think \(C) =\) is correct because they get the same wrong answer for both.
- **Basic**: Students here might start to apply the order of operations but could make calculation mistakes. They might see \(8+12 \div 4 = 11\) but then mistakenly think \((8+12) \div 4 = 11\) as well if they incorrectly add before dividing in the second expression, or they might correctly calculate both but still choose \(C) =\) due to oversight.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to calculate both expressions correctly (\(11\) and \(5\)) and understand that \(11 > 5\), so they would choose \(A) >\).
- **Advanced**: These students would also calculate correctly and understand the comparison, likely choosing \(A) >\). However, they might be more inclined to notice that \(D) \geq\) could potentially be considered if one of the expressions could equal the other under different circumstances, but given the calculations, \(A) >\) is the correct choice.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might get it right by chance), B=10% (not recognizing the greater than relationship), C=60% (thinking they are equal due to incorrect calculations), D=10% (less likely to consider greater than or equal to without correct calculations).
- **Basic**: A=40% (starting to understand order of operations but might make calculation errors), B=20% (recognizing one is larger but not sure which symbol), C=30% (thinking they are equal), D=10% (considering greater than or equal to).
- **Proficient**: A=70% (correctly applying order of operations and comparing), B=15% (mistake in calculation or comparison), C=10% (error in calculation), D=5% (unlikely to choose greater than or equal to if calculations are correct).
- **Advanced**: A=90% (strong understanding and application), B=5% (very rare mistake), C=3% (unlikely), D=2% (very unlikely).

## 7: Convert estimates into the required format
Given the estimates:
- **Below Basic**: A=20%, B=10%, C=60%, D=10%
- **Basic**: A=40%, B=20%, C=30%, D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=70%, B=15%, C=10%, D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=
