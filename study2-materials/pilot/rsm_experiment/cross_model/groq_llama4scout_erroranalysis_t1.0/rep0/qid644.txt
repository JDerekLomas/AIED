To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential errors that could lead to each wrong answer.

The question asks for the product of the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## Step 1: Identify the correct answer and the calculation error for each wrong option.
- The correct answer is \(+4\) (Option A).
- Option B: \(-4\) could result from a student forgetting that two negatives make a positive, so they calculate \(-1 \times -4 = -4\).
- Option C: \(+5\) does not directly result from a simple multiplication error of \(-1\) and \(-4\), so it's less likely but could come from a miscalculation or incorrect application of rules.
- Option D: \(-5\) similarly does not directly result from the multiplication of \(-1\) and \(-4\).

## 2: Analyze the errors and student likely hood to make them.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication facts or the rules of signs. They might choose B (\(-4\)) because they forget that multiplying two negatives gives a positive.
- **Basic:** Students at this level understand basic multiplication and the rules of signs but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to choose A (\(+4\)) correctly but could be tempted by B (\(-4\)) if they misapply the sign rules.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the multiplication of negatives and positives. They are less likely to choose B (\(-4\)) or the unrelated options C (\(+5\)) and D (\(-5\)).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are confident in their understanding and application of mathematical rules. They are expected to choose A (\(+4\)) correctly.

## 3: Estimate the percentages based on likely errors and student understanding.
- **Below Basic:** Might choose A=40% (correct but struggling), B=50% (error in sign), C=5%, D=5%.
- **Basic:** Likely to choose A=80% (correct), B=15% (simple mistake), C=2%, D=3%.
- **Proficient:** Expected to choose A=95% (correct), B=4% (careless mistake), C=0.5%, D=0.5%.
- **Advanced:** Will choose A=99% (correct), B=1% (rare mistake), C=0%, D=0%.

## 4: Convert estimates into the required format.
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=40% B=50% C=5% D=5%
- basic: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
- proficient: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%
- advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=50% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
proficient: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
