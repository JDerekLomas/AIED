To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question asks for the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \). The correct answer is \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which is option A.

## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), is the correct representation of \( c \div(h+4) \) using algebraic convention. Students who understand that division by a quantity is equivalent to multiplication by its reciprocal and can properly apply parentheses to denote the order of operations will choose this option.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \), might seem attractive to students who mistakenly add 4 to \( c \) in the numerator, possibly due to a misinterpretation of the division as an opportunity to add, or simply because they are not paying attention to the operation between \( c \) and \( (h+4) \).

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \), could appeal to students who incorrectly distribute or apply operations. This might happen if a student thinks \( c \div(h+4) \) means \( c \) divided by \( h \) plus 4, showing a misunderstanding of how to handle the division with the expression \( (h+4) \) in the denominator.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( \frac{h+4}{c} \), seems to be a reversal of the original expression, suggesting that some students might confuse the order of \( c \) and \( (h+4) \) or mistakenly invert the fraction.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often struggle with basic algebraic concepts. They might not understand the concept of division by an expression or may not recognize the correct placement of parentheses. 
  - A: 40% (some recognition of correct form but inconsistent application)
  - B: 25% (addition error in numerator)
  - C: 20% (misunderstanding of division and addition)
  - D: 15% (complete reversal or confusion)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may struggle with nuances.
  - A: 60% (understand division by an expression)
  - B: 20% (still making simple addition errors)
  - C: 10% (some understanding but operation mistakes)
  - D: 10% (less confusion but still some errors)

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebraic conventions.
  - A: 80% (clear understanding of algebraic division)
  - B: 10% (minor errors due to inattention)
  - C: 5% (occasional misapplication of operations)
  - D: 5% (rare but possible confusion)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident in their algebraic manipulations.
  - A: 95% (strong understanding and application)
  - B: 3% (rare errors due to distraction)
  - C: 1% (very occasional mistake)
  - D: 1% (extremely rare confusion)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
