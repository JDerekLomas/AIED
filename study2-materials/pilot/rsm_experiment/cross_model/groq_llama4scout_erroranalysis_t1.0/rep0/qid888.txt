## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct answer can be found using the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last), which yields \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\). This corresponds to option B.

## 2: Identify potential calculation errors for each wrong answer
- Option A: \(m^2 - 2m - 35\). This could result from incorrectly multiplying the terms, possibly \(m^2 - 7m + 5m - 35\), which simplifies to \(m^2 - 2m - 35\). The error here seems to be a miscalculation of the middle terms.
- Option C: \(m^2 + 12m + 35\). This might come from adding the terms inside the brackets instead of subtracting, or a mistake in signs, leading to \(m^2 + 7m + 5m + 35 = m^2 + 12m + 35\).
- Option D: \(m^2 - 12m - 35\). This could result from a mistake in the signs of the terms when multiplying, possibly \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35\), which simplifies to \(m^2 - 12m - 35\).

## 3: Analyze the errors and student likely hood to make them
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication and algebraic manipulations. They are more likely to make simple arithmetic errors or not understand the FOIL method. Option A and D might be tempting due to simple arithmetic mistakes.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with applying the FOIL method correctly or managing negative signs. They could easily fall into traps like option A or C due to misinterpreting the signs or operations.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the FOIL method but might occasionally make careless errors, such as confusing the signs or miscalculating the products. Option A or D could be chosen due to oversight in calculations.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of algebraic manipulations. They are less likely to make basic errors but might still choose incorrect options if they misunderstand the application of the FOIL method or rush through the calculation.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to choose A (20%) and D (30%) due to simple arithmetic mistakes, B (10%) if they somehow manage to get it right or partially right, and C (40%) if they incorrectly add the terms.
- **Basic**: Students might choose A (25%), B (40%) if they understand the method but make minor errors, C (20%) due to sign mistakes, and D (15%).
- **Proficient**: Here, A (10%), B (80%), C (5%), and D (5%) seem plausible, with most getting it right but a few making careless errors.
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to choose B (90%), with small percentages for A (5%), C (2%), and D (3%) due to very few, minor errors.

## 5: Convert predictions into the required format
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
- **basic**: A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
