## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential errors
The question requires students to substitute \( k = -3 \) into the equation \( T = k^4 \) to find \( T \). The correct calculation is \( T = (-3)^4 = 81 \). We need to consider common errors that might lead students to choose incorrect options.

## 2: Identify potential calculation errors for each wrong answer
- Option B (12) could result from \( (-3) \times 4 = -12 \) and then possibly a miscalculation or incorrect handling of the exponent, but more likely it's from \( k^4 \) being misunderstood as \( k \times 4 \) or another incorrect operation.
- Option C (-81) might come from \( -3^4 \) where students forget to apply the exponent to the negative sign properly, or calculate \( -(3^4) \) directly.
- Option D (-12) seems to come from a misunderstanding similar to option B but with an incorrect sign.

## 3: Analyze the errors in terms of student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of exponents or might make basic arithmetic mistakes. They could easily fall into traps like calculating \( -3 \times 4 \) (leading to B or D) or simply not understanding that \( (-3)^4 \) is positive (avoiding C).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with applying rules correctly, especially with negative numbers and exponents. They might calculate \( T = -3^4 \) directly (getting -81) or mistakenly think \( k^4 \) means \( k \times 4 \).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the rules of exponents and can apply them but might still make careless mistakes, especially under time pressure. They are less likely to choose B or D but might still opt for C if they misinterpret the application of the negative sign.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, including the proper handling of negative numbers raised to powers. They are likely to calculate \( (-3)^4 \) correctly as 81.

## 4: Estimate the percentages based on common errors and student abilities
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (struggle with concept), B=20% (simple multiplication error), C=30% (misunderstand negative sign application), D=10% (simple arithmetic mistake).
- **Basic**: A=60% (understand concept but might make minor errors), B=15% (misunderstand exponent), C=20% (apply negative sign incorrectly), D=5% (careless mistake).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (strong understanding), B=5% (minor mistake), C=10% (occasional misapplication of rules), D=5% (rare careless error).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (excellent understanding), B=2% (very rare mistake), C=2% (exceptional misapplication), D=1% (extremely rare error).

## 5: Convert estimates into the required format
Given the analysis, let's assign specific percentages:
- **below_basic**: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
- **basic**: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
