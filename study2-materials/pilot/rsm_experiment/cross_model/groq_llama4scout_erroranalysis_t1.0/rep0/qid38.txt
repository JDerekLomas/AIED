## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors
The question requires students to add two fractions: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \). To add these fractions, students need to find a common denominator, which in this case is \(2x\). The correct steps involve converting \( \frac{4}{x} \) to \( \frac{8}{2x} \) and then adding it to \( \frac{3}{2x} \) to get \( \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \).

## 2: Identify potential errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error could be adding the numerators and denominators separately: \( \frac{3 + 4}{2x + x} = \frac{7}{3x} \) (Option B). This method feels natural but is incorrect.
- Another error might be finding the common denominator but then incorrectly adding the fractions: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \) (Correct answer, Option A).
- Some might incorrectly assume the common denominator is \(x\), leading to \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} \) but then not converting \( \frac{4}{x} \) properly, or simply adding \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \) as \( \frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \) but getting the conversion wrong.
- A straightforward mistake could be not finding a common denominator, leading to \( \frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \) directly without error, but this actually leads to the correct answer.

## 3: Analyze each option for likely student responses
- Option A (\( \frac{11}{2x} \)): Correct answer. Students who understand finding a common denominator and adding fractions will choose this.
- Option B (\( \frac{7}{3x} \)): This comes from incorrectly adding the denominators and numerators separately, a common and attractive error.
- Option C (\( \frac{11}{x} \)): This could result from students who find the common denominator correctly (\(2x\)) and add the fractions but then simplify incorrectly or not at all.
- Option D (\( \frac{7}{2x} \)): This might come from students who add the numerators incorrectly or do not convert one of the fractions to have the common denominator.

## 4: Estimate percentages based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to make significant errors. Option B (\( \frac{7}{3x} \)) seems attractive because it involves a simple addition of numerators and denominators. Option D could also be appealing due to simple addition errors. **Below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%**
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic concepts but may apply them inconsistently. They are likely to struggle with finding and applying the common denominator correctly. **Basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%**
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of adding fractions with a common denominator. They are less likely to fall into simple traps. **Proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%**
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concept but also apply it accurately and efficiently. They are unlikely to choose incorrect options. **Advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%**

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
