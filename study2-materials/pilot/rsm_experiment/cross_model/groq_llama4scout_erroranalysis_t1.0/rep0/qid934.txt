## Step 1: Understand the question and the table of values
The table of values is for the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\). We need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\), which is represented by the star (\(\bigstar\)) in the table.

## 2: Solve the equation for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
To find \(y\) when \(x = 0\), substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\).
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[0 + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]
\[y = 5\]

## 3: Identify the correct answer
The correct answer is \(y = 5\) when \(x = 0\), which corresponds to option C.

## 4: Analyze potential calculation errors for each wrong answer
- Option A (\(20\)): This could result from \(4x + 2y = 10\) becoming \(2y = 10 \times 4\) or a similar miscalculation when \(x = 0\), leading to \(2y = 40\) and \(y = 20\).
- Option B (\(3\)): This might come from a miscalculation or incorrect substitution, such as \(4(0) + 2y = 10\) leading to \(2y = 6\) and \(y = 3\).
- Option D (\(2.5\)): This could result from \(4x + y = 10\) (incorrectly halving the \(2y\) term) when \(x = 0\), giving \(y = 10\) and then possibly dividing by 4, or other incorrect manipulations.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option
- **Below Basic**: These students often struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might choose A (\(20\%\)) if they incorrectly multiply 10 by 2 or perform a similar basic arithmetic error. B (\(3\)) could be chosen if they simplify incorrectly. C (\(5\)) is the correct answer but may not be chosen due to calculation mistakes. D (\(2.5\)) might be selected with incorrect division. Given their struggle, let's assume: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%.
- **Basic**: These students understand basic algebra but might make simple mistakes. They are more likely to choose C (\(5\)) but could be tempted by B (\(3\)) or D (\(2.5\)) with minor calculation errors. A (\(20\)) seems less likely but possible with significant errors. Let's assume: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students have a good grasp of algebra and are less likely to make simple mistakes. They should mostly choose C (\(5\)). Options A, B, and D are less likely but could happen with momentary lapses in concentration. Let's assume: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: These students are very confident in their algebraic manipulations. They are highly likely to choose C (\(5\)) and very unlikely to choose A, B, or D, as these represent more significant errors. Let's assume: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%.

## 6: Format the predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
