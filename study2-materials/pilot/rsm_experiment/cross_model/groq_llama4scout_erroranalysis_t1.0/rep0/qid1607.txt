## Step 1: Understand the equation and Isaac's steps
The given equation is \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \). Isaac's steps are:
Step \( 1: \) \( 60=1+k \)
Step \( 2: \) \( 61=k \)
To verify these steps, we should solve the equation properly.

## 2: Solve the equation properly
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 4 gives:
\( 15 \times 4 = 1 + k \)
\( 60 = 1 + k \)
Subtracting 1 from both sides:
\( 59 = k \)
So, the correct solution is \( k = 59 \).

## 3: Evaluate Isaac's steps
- Step 1: \( 60=1+k \) is correct based on our calculation.
- Step 2: \( 61=k \) is incorrect because we found \( k = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 4: Determine the correct answer choice
Given the evaluation:
- Step 1 is correct.
- Step 2 is incorrect.
So, the correct answer is A) Only step \( 1 \).

## 5: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option
### below_basic
Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulation or checking steps. They might see that Step 2 seems to follow from Step 1 but not realize it's incorrect. 
- A: 20% (some might see Step 1 as correct but not understand why Step 2 is wrong)
- B: 30% (might think Step 2 is correct without checking)
- C: 10% (unlikely to think both are correct given the obvious mistake in Step 2)
- D: 40% (might recognize both steps aren't fully correct)

### basic
Students here have a basic understanding but might make simple arithmetic errors or not check their work thoroughly.
- A: 40% (recognize Step 1 is correct, might see Step 2's error)
- B: 20% (might only see Step 2)
- C: 5% (unlikely to think both are correct)
- D: 35% (see that Step 2 is wrong, might not be sure about Step 1)

### proficient
These students understand algebraic manipulations and are likely to catch errors.
- A: 60% (clearly see Step 1 is correct, Step 2 is not)
- B: 10% (less likely to be misled by Step 2)
- C: 5% (very unlikely to think both are correct)
- D: 25% (might recognize the mistake in Step 2 but not recheck Step 1)

### advanced
Advanced students are likely to solve the equation and verify each step carefully.
- A: 80% (clearly correct, given their understanding)
- B: 5% (unlikely to choose this, given they can verify)
- C: 0% (they know both can't be correct)
- D: 15% (might consider if there's an alternative interpretation, but unlikely)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%
