## Step 1: Understanding the question and the potential errors
The question requires students to evaluate two proposed next steps in solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\). Tom suggests \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), and Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\). To assess these, we need to understand the correct method and common errors.

## 2: Identifying the correct next steps
The correct next step to solve \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) would be to add 5 to both sides, resulting in \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), which matches Tom's suggestion. This is a standard algebraic manipulation. Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), would be incorrect because it implies multiplying \(\frac{x}{3}\) by 3 to get \(x\), but it doesn't correctly account for the multiplication of the entire equation by 3, which should actually result in \(x - 15 = 36\).

## 3: Analyzing Tom's suggestion
Tom's suggestion, \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), is correct because adding 5 to both sides of the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) yields \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This step is straightforward and algebraically sound.

## 4: Analyzing Katie's suggestion
Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), implies that she multiplied every term by 3, which would actually give \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\). This indicates a misunderstanding of algebraic operations.

## 5: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulations. They might choose options based on superficial understanding or guesswork. Given the nature of the question, these students might be more likely to choose \(D\) (Neither is correct) because they don't understand the correct process, or they might incorrectly validate Katie's step due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Basic level students understand simple algebra but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to recognize Tom's step as correct but might be confused by Katie's, potentially leading them to choose \(A\) (Only Tom) as they see the direct addition to isolate \(\frac{x}{3}\) but don't correctly validate Katie's incorrect manipulation.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand algebraic manipulations well. They will see Tom's suggestion as correct. For Katie's suggestion, they will recognize it as incorrect because it doesn't properly account for multiplying every term by 3. Thus, they are likely to choose \(A\) (Only Tom).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the algebraic manipulations but also can quickly identify incorrect steps. They will clearly see Tom's step as correct and Katie's as incorrect (since multiplying by 3 should yield \(x - 15 = 36\)), leading them to choose \(A\) (Only Tom).

## 6: Assigning percentages
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle to understand the algebraic process. They could potentially choose \(B\) (Only Katie) or \(D\) (Neither is correct) due to misunderstanding, but \(D\) seems more likely for those who don't see either as correct. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 15\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 55\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here are more likely to see Tom's step as correct but might be divided on Katie's. \(A = 60\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students will mostly see Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect. \(A = 80\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will accurately assess both. \(A = 90\%\), \(B = 0\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 5\%\).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
