To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential errors.

The question asks for the correct calculation of the mean of the numbers 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. The correct formula for the mean is the sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers. Therefore, the correct calculation is \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \), which corresponds to option A if we adjust it to \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \).

## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). This option is incorrect because it excludes the 0 from the sum, which is a crucial part of calculating the mean. Students who choose this option likely understand the basic formula for the mean but make a careless error by omitting one of the numbers.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \). This option incorrectly suggests dividing only the last number by 5 before adding the others, which misinterprets the order of operations. Students choosing this might be confused about how to apply the division in the context of finding a mean.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \). This option incorrectly divides by 4 instead of 5 and also excludes the 0 from the sum. Students who choose this option may understand that they need to sum the numbers and divide by the count but make two errors: omitting 0 and using the wrong divisor.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D is "None of them". For a student to choose this, they must recognize that all provided calculations (A, B, C) are incorrect.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often lack understanding of basic mathematical concepts. They might choose B because it seems to follow an "add then divide" approach but misapplied, or C because it seems like a simplified version of calculating a mean. A might seem correct to some but for the wrong reason (not including 0). D seems unlikely as they might not recognize the errors. 
  - A: 20% (some might get the sum part right but not see the need for 0)
  - B: 30% (attractive due to its simplicity and seeming to follow an operation order)
  - C: 30% (simple error in count and omission)
  - D: 20% (less likely to recognize all are wrong)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may make careless errors. 
  - A: 40% (close but excluding 0)
  - B: 20% (recognize it as wrong but might have been tempted)
  - C: 20% (error in both sum and division)
  - D: 20% (starting to recognize errors)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept but might make minor errors.
  - A: 60% (likely to spot the need for 0 but might be distracted)
  - B: 10% (less likely to fall for this due to understanding order of operations)
  - C: 10% (recognize both issues)
  - D: 20% (aware of the errors)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are likely to get it right or recognize the errors in the options.
  - A: 80% (correct calculation, just ensure 0 is included)
  - B: 5% (unlikely to fall for operation mistake)
  - C: 5% (aware of both errors)
  - D: 10% (recognize all provided options are flawed)

## 6: Converting to Requested Format
Based on analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
- basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- proficient: A=60% B=10% C=10% D=20%
- advanced: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=60% B=10% C=10% D=20%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
