## Step 1: Understand the question and the calculation required
The question requires the evaluation of the expression \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). To solve it, one must follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). So, the correct steps are: multiplication first (\(4 \times 2 = 8\)), then addition and subtraction from left to right (\(3 - 5 + 8\)).

## 2: Calculate the correct answer
Following BIDMAS:
1. Multiply \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Then, \(3 - 5 + 8 = 6\)

So, the correct answer is A) \(6\).

## 3: Analyze potential errors for each wrong option
- Option B) \(4\): This could result from \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 \times 2 = -2 + 8 = 6\), which is actually correct, indicating a miscalculation in this step. A possible mistake leading to \(4\) could be \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\), then \(2 \times 2 = 4\), which shows a misunderstanding of order of operations.
- Option C) \(-12\): This might come from \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 = 2\), and \(2 \times 2 = 4\), which doesn't lead to \(-12\), indicating another mistake. A possible error could be \(-5 + 4 = -1\), then \(3 \times -1 \times 2 = -6\) or similar incorrect operations, but directly getting \(-12\) seems unlikely without a specific mistake like \(3 - 5 = -2\), \(4 \times 2 = 8\), \(-2 + 8 = 6\), or an error in handling the operations.
- Option D) \(-10\): This could result from a straightforward incorrect calculation: \(3 - 5 = -2\), \(-2 + 4 = 2\), \(2 \times 2 = 4\), or more directly, \(5 - 3 = 2\), \(2 + 4 \times 2 = 2 + 8 = 10\), then mistakenly subtracting or adding to get \(-10\).

## 4: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students often struggle with basic arithmetic and order of operations. They might calculate from left to right without considering BIDMAS: \(3 - 5 = -2\), \(-2 + 4 = 2\), \(2 \times 2 = 4\). So, B) \(4\) seems attractive. Some might get \(-12\) or \(-10\) through incorrect handling of signs or operations.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic operations but might still struggle with applying BIDMAS consistently. They might choose B) \(4\) if they do \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\) then \(2 \times 2 = 4\), or choose D) \(-10\) through incorrect operations.
- **Proficient**: These students understand BIDMAS and can apply it but might make careless mistakes. They are less likely to choose incorrect options unless they miscalculate.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand BIDMAS but also are less prone to calculation errors.

## 5: Estimate percentages
Given the common mistakes and understanding of BIDMAS:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some get it right by chance), B=40% (easy mistake), C=15% (unlikely but possible through confusion), D=25% (direct calculation errors).
- **Basic**: A=50% (understand BIDMAS but might make errors), B=30% (common mistake), C=10% (less likely), D=10% (less likely).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (strong understanding of BIDMAS), B=15% (occasional mistake), C=3% (unlikely), D=2% (unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (very strong understanding), B=4% (rare mistake), C=0.5% (very unlikely), D=0.5% (very unlikely).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%
