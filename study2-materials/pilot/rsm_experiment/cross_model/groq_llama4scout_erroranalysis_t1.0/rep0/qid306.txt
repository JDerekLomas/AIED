To approach this question, let's analyze the problems and the common mistakes students might make, considering the order of operations.

## Step 1: Understanding the Order of Operations
The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). For Problem P: \( 4-5+6= \), there are no brackets, indices, division, or multiplication, so we proceed from left to right: subtraction and then addition. For Problem Q: \( 4+5 \times 6= \), according to BIDMAS, we should do the multiplication before the addition.

## 2: Identifying Calculations for Each Problem
For Problem P, the calculation should proceed as \( 4 - 5 + 6 \), which means we first do \( 4 - 5 \) and then add 6. For Problem Q, we should first do \( 5 \times 6 \) and then add 4.

## 3: Analyzing Wrong Answers
- Option A suggests doing \( 4-5 \) first in Problem P (correct) and \( 4+5 \) first in Problem Q (incorrect because it ignores BIDMAS).
- Option B suggests \( 4-5 \) for Problem P (correct) and \( 5 \times 6 \) for Problem Q (correct).
- Option C suggests \( 5+6 \) for Problem P (incorrect) and \( 4+5 \) for Problem Q (incorrect).
- Option D suggests \( 5+6 \) for Problem P (incorrect) and \( 5 \times 6 \) for Problem Q (correct).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations. They might choose options that seem simplest or most straightforward without applying BIDMAS correctly. Option A might appeal because it starts with a simple subtraction but incorrectly applies the order in Problem Q. Option C could be attractive for those not understanding the correct order. **Below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%**
- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding but might still make careless mistakes. They are more likely to recognize the need for \( 4-5 \) in Problem P but could be tricked into \( 4+5 \) for Problem Q. **Basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%**
- **Proficient:** These students understand BIDMAS and are likely to choose the correct option, B, but a small percentage might still be confused, especially if they misread the problems. **Proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%**
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, including BIDMAS. They are likely to choose B without hesitation. **Advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%**

The best answer is B.
