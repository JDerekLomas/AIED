## Step 1: Understand the question and the operations involved
The question requires the evaluation of the expression \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). To solve this, one must follow the order of operations: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.

## 2: Identify the correct solution
First, perform the multiplication: \(4 \times 2 = 8\). Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \(3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6\). So, the correct answer is A) \(6\).

## 3: Analyze potential errors for each wrong option
- Option B) \(4\): This could result from incorrectly calculating \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\), then \(2 \times 2 = 4\), which is a misunderstanding of the order of operations.
- Option C) \(-12\): This might come from \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 = 2\), and \(2 \times 2 = 4\) or directly from \(-2 \times 4 = -8\) and \(-8 + 4 \times 2\) (misinterpretation), or simply adding/subtracting incorrectly without following order of operations properly.
- Option D) \(-10\): This could come from \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 = 2\), and \(2 \times 2 = 4\) does not lead to \(-10\), but \(-2 \times 4 = -8\) and \(-8 + (-2) = -10\) or similar incorrect manipulations.

## 4: Consider the most likely calculation errors
- A common error is not following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), leading to incorrect calculations.
- For B) \(4\), students might do \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\) and then somehow incorrectly involve the \(2\) from \(4 \times 2\).
- For C) \(-12\), an error could be \(3 - 5 = -2\), \(4 \times 2 = 8\), and then \(-2 + 8 = 6\) (which is correct, indicating a miscalculation in predicting this option).
- For D) \(-10\), students might incorrectly calculate as \(3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 = 3 - 9 \times 2 = 3 - 18 = -15\) or similar, not directly leading to \(-10\).

## 5: Assess which errors are attractive and which students are likely to make them
- Students at the lower end (below_basic, basic) are more likely to make errors in following the order of operations or in basic arithmetic.
- The error leading to B) \(4\) seems plausible if students incorrectly simplify before multiplying.
- C) \(-12\) and D) \(-10\) seem less direct results of simple arithmetic mistakes.

## 6: Estimate the percentage of students at each level choosing each option
Given the correct answer is A) \(6\), and assuming:
- Below_basic students are more prone to simple arithmetic mistakes and not following order of operations.
- Basic students might understand the concept of order of operations but apply it inconsistently.
- Proficient students should mostly get it right but might have some slips.
- Advanced students are likely to get it right.

## 7: Make predictions
- **Below_basic**: Likely to have high rates of error. Option C) \(-12\) and D) \(-10\) might seem plausible due to incorrect operations or order. A=20%, B=10%, C=30%, D=40%.
- **Basic**: Understanding of order of operations is there but might not be consistently applied. A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Proficient**: Mostly correct but with some errors. A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Almost all correct. A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
