## Step 1: Understand the question and the possible answers
The question asks students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct answer can be found using the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last), which yields \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\). So, the correct answer is B) \(m^{2}-12 m+35\).

## 2: Identify common errors leading to incorrect answers
- Option A) \(m^{2}-2 m-35\): This could result from incorrectly multiplying the terms, possibly \(m \cdot m - 5 \cdot 7 = m^2 - 35\) and then mistakenly subtracting \(2m\) without clear derivation.
- Option C) \(m^{2}+12 m+35\): This might come from \((m-5)(m-7) = m^2 + 5m + 7m + 35 = m^2 + 12m + 35\), incorrectly adding the terms inside the brackets instead of subtracting.
- Option D) \(m^{2}-12 m-35\): This error could arise from \((m-5)(m-7) = m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35\), mistakenly subtracting the product of \(-5\) and \(-7\).

## 3: Analyze the errors in terms of student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They could easily fall into traps like adding or subtracting incorrectly. Option A seems less likely as it requires some form of subtraction but not the full correct expansion. Option C is attractive because it involves simple addition, which might seem natural but is incorrect. Option D involves a plausible mistake in handling the negative signs.

- **Basic**: At this level, students are expected to have a grasp of basic algebraic operations. They might still make careless mistakes. The error leading to Option D seems plausible as it involves a straightforward but incorrect handling of negative terms.

- **Proficient**: Proficient students are likely to understand the FOIL method but might make minor errors under pressure. Option A seems less likely here as it doesn't follow from a straightforward application of FOIL or common mistakes.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students are less likely to make these errors but might if they rush or misinterpret the signs.

## 4: Estimate percentages based on error analysis
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (simple mistake, not following FOIL properly), B=40% (correct method but possibly careless error), C=25% (adding instead of subtracting, an easy mistake), D=15% (incorrect handling of signs).
- **Basic**: A=15%, B=60%, C=15%, D=10% (as they are more likely to get it right or make straightforward errors).
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=80%, C=5%, D=10% (less likely to make careless mistakes).
- **Advanced**: A=2%, B=90%, C=2%, D=6% (very few errors expected).

## 5: Convert estimates into the required format
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=2% D=6%
