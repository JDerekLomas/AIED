To approach this question, let's first analyze the steps given and identify the correct method, then determine the common errors that might lead students to choose incorrect options.

The equation given is \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\). To solve for \(k\), the correct steps involve multiplying both sides by 4 to isolate \(1+k\), and then solving for \(k\).

Correct Step 1: \(15 \times 4 = 1 + k\), which simplifies to \(60 = 1 + k\).

Correct Step 2: \(60 - 1 = k\), which simplifies to \(59 = k\).

Now, let's evaluate Isaac's steps:
- Step 1: \(60 = 1 + k\) is correct, as it follows from multiplying both sides of the equation by 4.
- Step 2: \(61 = k\) is incorrect, as it incorrectly adds 1 to both sides instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to solve for \(k\).

Given this, let's assess the options:
- A: Only step 1 is correct. This is true based on the correct calculation.
- B: Only step 2 is correct. This is false because step 2 is incorrect.
- C: Both steps are correct. This is false because step 2 is incorrect.
- D: Both steps are incorrect. This is false because step 1 is correct.

## Step 1: Analyzing the Calculation Error for Each Option
The calculation error leading to wrong answers involves misunderstanding algebraic manipulation. For option B, students might incorrectly validate Isaac's step 2 without checking its derivation. For option C, students might not catch the mistake in step 2. For option D, students might incorrectly assume both steps are wrong.

## 2: Identifying Attractive Errors
The error in step 2 (\(61 = k\)) might seem attractive to students who are not meticulous in their algebraic manipulations, especially if they quickly glance over the steps without substitution or checking.

## 3: Determining Student Awareness
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic equations and could easily fall into traps, potentially choosing B or C because they don't fully grasp the process.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes. They could choose B if they mistakenly think step 2 is correct or C if they don't notice the error.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the algebra but might still make errors if they're inattentive. They are less likely to choose B or C.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly unlikely to make such errors and will accurately identify the correctness of steps.

## 4: Predicting Percentages
Given the nature of the question and common student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (understanding that at least step 1 seems right), B=30% (mistaking step 2), C=20% (not catching the error), D=10% (realizing both are not correct but struggling to articulate).
- **Basic**: A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: A=95%, B=0%, C=0%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
