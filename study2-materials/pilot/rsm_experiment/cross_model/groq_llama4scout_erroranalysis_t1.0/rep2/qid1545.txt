## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors
The question requires students to compare the values of two expressions: \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\). The correct calculation for the first expression is \(8 + 3 = 11\) (following order of operations: division before addition) and for the second expression is \(20 \div 4 = 5\). Therefore, the correct symbol to use is \(>\).

## 2: Identify common calculation errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error is to ignore the order of operations or to misapply it. For the first expression, some might calculate \(8 + 12 = 20\) and then \(20 \div 4 = 5\), mistakenly thinking both expressions equal 5, which leads to \(C =\).
- Another error could be calculating both expressions correctly but then comparing them incorrectly or choosing an incorrect symbol out of habit or misunderstanding.
- The "attractive" wrong answer might be \(C =\) because it suggests an equality that seems plausible if one incorrectly assumes both sides equal 5.

## 3: Analyze the options and predict student responses
- **Option A (\(>\))**: This is the correct answer. Students who understand and apply the order of operations correctly will choose this.
- **Option B (\(<\))**: This would be chosen by students who incorrectly think \((8+12) \div 4 > 8 + 12 \div 4\), possibly due to a miscalculation or misunderstanding of the operations.
- **Option C (\(=\))**: This is a likely incorrect choice for students who calculate both expressions as equal to 5, due to misapplication of the order of operations.
- **Option D (\(\geq\))**: This might be chosen by students who are unsure or think one expression could be greater than or equal to the other, possibly reflecting a lack of confidence in their calculations.

## 4: Predict percentages based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to make significant errors. They might choose \(C =\) if they calculate both sides as 5 incorrectly, or randomly select an option. \(C =\) seems attractive here. A=10%, B=20%, C=60%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still make calculation errors. They are more likely to choose \(C =\) if they misunderstand the order of operations. A=20%, B=15%, C=60%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations and are less likely to make simple calculation errors. They should mostly choose \(A >\). A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the order of operations but are also less prone to careless errors. They should almost all choose \(A >\). A=95%, B=0%, C=5%, D=0%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
