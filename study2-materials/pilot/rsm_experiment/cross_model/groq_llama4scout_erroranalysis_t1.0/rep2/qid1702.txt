## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question provides an equation \(10x - 6y = 30\) and a table of values with \(y = 0.5\). The task is to find the value of \(x\) that replaces the star (\(\bigstar\)).

## 2: Solving the Equation for \(x\)
To find \(x\), we substitute \(y = 0.5\) into the equation:
\[10x - 6(0.5) = 30\]
\[10x - 3 = 30\]
\[10x = 33\]
\[x = 3.3\]

## 3: Identifying Wrong Answers and Calculation Errors
- Option A: \(4.25\)
- Option B: \(-4.25\)
- Option C: \(3.3\) (Correct answer)
- Option D: \(2.7\)

## 4: Analyzing Potential Calculation Errors
- A common error could be in the substitution or solving steps. For example, incorrectly solving for \(x\) or \(y\).
- For \(x = 4.25\), a possible error could be \(10x - 6(0.5) = 30\) leading to \(10x - 3 = 30\), then \(10x = 30 + 3 = 33\), but mistakenly calculating \(x\) as \(4.25\) instead of \(3.3\), perhaps due to a miscalculation or incorrect division.
- For \(x = -4.25\), an error might involve incorrect handling of negative numbers or signs, such as \(10x = 30 - 3 = 27\), then \(x = 2.7\), or another sign mistake.
- For \(x = 2.7\), a possible mistake could be \(10x = 27\) (from \(10x - 3 = 27\), assuming a wrong constant term), leading to \(x = 2.7\).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and substitution. They might incorrectly solve the equation or substitute values. Given the simplicity of the correct calculation, errors here might be more pronounced. Option B (\(-4.25\)) could appeal to those who mishandle signs or operations. A (\(4.25\)) and D (\(2.7\)) might also be chosen due to simple arithmetic mistakes.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebraic manipulations but might make careless errors. They are likely to attempt the question but might fall into traps like misinterpreting the equation or miscalculating. Option A or D might seem plausible if they incorrectly calculate \(x\).
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebraic methods and are less likely to make simple arithmetic errors. However, they might still fall into more sophisticated traps or misinterpret parts of the question. The correct answer, C (\(3.3\)), should be within their reach, with fewer errors compared to lower ability levels.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to solve the equation accurately with minimal errors. They should easily identify the correct answer as \(3.3\).

## 6: Estimating Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple miscalculation), B=20% (sign error), C=10% (got it right by chance or minimal understanding), D=40% (another type of simple error).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=15%, C=60%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
