## Step 1: Understand the problems and the correct order of operations.
Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \) and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). For Problem P, since it's just addition and subtraction, we perform operations from left to right, so the correct order is \( 4-5 \) first. For Problem Q, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication comes before addition, so \( 5 \times 6 \) should be done first.

## 2: Identify the correct answers.
For Problem P, the correct calculation to do first is \( 4-5 \). For Problem Q, the correct calculation to do first is \( 5 \times 6 \). Therefore, the correct choice is B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 3: Analyze potential errors and student misconceptions.
- A common error in Problem P would be to add or subtract in a different order, but since the operations are all the same type (addition and subtraction), students are more likely to get it right or mistakenly do \( 5+6 \) first, which is incorrect.
- For Problem Q, a common error is to ignore the order of operations and do \( 4+5 \) first, which aligns with option A.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand the order of operations at all. They might choose A because it seems natural to start with the first operation in both cases without applying the correct rules.
- **Basic:** Basic level students might have a partial understanding but could easily fall into the trap of doing operations in the order they appear for both problems or misunderstanding the rules. They might choose A or C.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the order of operations and would likely choose B, as they know \( 5 \times 6 \) must be done before \( 4+ \) in Problem Q, and operations are performed left to right in Problem P.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students would certainly choose B, as they not only understand but can also apply the rules confidently.

## 5: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level.
- **Below Basic:** A=60% (natural but incorrect sequence), B=20% (correct but might not understand why), C=10% (incorrect), D=10% (correct understanding but less likely).
- **Basic:** A=40% (easy mistake), B=30% (understanding but might be hesitant), C=20% (confusion), D=10% (correct but less confident).
- **Proficient:** A=10% (some confusion), B=80% (correct understanding), C=5% (minor confusion), D=5% (overconfidence in wrong method).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (no confusion), B=95% (clear understanding), C=0% (no mistake), D=5% (maybe checking alternative methods).

## 6: Convert estimates into the required format.
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **below_basic:** A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
- **basic:** A=45% B=40% C=10% D=5%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
- **advanced:** A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
basic: A=45% B=40% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
