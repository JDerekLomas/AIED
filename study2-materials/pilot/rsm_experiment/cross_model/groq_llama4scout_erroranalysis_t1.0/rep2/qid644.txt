## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question requires multiplying the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## 2: Identifying wrong answers and potential calculation errors
- Option A: \(+4\) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \(-4\) could result from a mistake where a student forgets that multiplying two negatives gives a positive.
- Option C: \(+5\) and Option D: \(-5\) are incorrect and likely result from more significant misunderstandings or calculation errors.

## 3: Analyzing potential errors for each option
- Option B (\( -4 \)): This error suggests a student forgot the rule that two negative numbers multiplied together give a positive number. This is a common and "attractive" error because it feels natural to just multiply the numbers without considering the signs.
- Option C (\( +5 \)) and Option D (\( -5 \)): These errors are less straightforward and might result from more complex mistakes, such as misinterpreting the terms or adding instead of multiplying.

## 4: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand the basic rules of multiplying negative numbers or might not even attempt the question correctly. They are more likely to choose randomly or based on simple errors. Option B (\( -4 \)) seems a plausible choice here because it's a straightforward multiplication error.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple arithmetic or sign errors. They are likely to choose Option B (\( -4 \)) as it's a common mistake.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the rules but might be in a rush or not fully focused, potentially leading to fewer errors but still some chance of selecting B due to oversight.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are less likely to make such basic errors and should mostly choose the correct answer, A (\( +4 \)).

## 5: Estimating percentages
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some get it right by chance), B=40% (common error), C=15%, D=25% (random or other simple errors).
- **Basic**: A=60%, B=30%, C=5%, D=5% (most get it right but some make the simple error).
- **Proficient**: A=85%, B=10%, C=2%, D=3% (mostly correct with few errors).
- **Advanced**: A=95%, B=4%, C=0.5%, D=0.5% (very few errors).

## 6: Converting to requested format
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%
