## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential errors
The question requires students to solve the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) and determine if Tom or Katie's suggested next line of working is correct. Tom suggests \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), and Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\). To assess the correctness of each student's suggestion, we need to understand the algebraic manipulation involved.

## 2: Analyze Tom's suggestion
Tom's suggestion, \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), can be derived by adding 5 to both sides of the original equation: \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5\), which simplifies to \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This is a correct algebraic manipulation.

## 3: Analyze Katie's suggestion
Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), seems to misunderstand the original equation. To get \(x - 5 = 36\), one would multiply every term by 3: \(3 \times \frac{x}{3} - 3 \times 5 = 3 \times 12\), resulting in \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\). Thus, Katie's suggestion is incorrect based on the given equation.

## 4: Determine the correct answer
Given that Tom's suggestion is correct and Katie's is not, the correct answer is A) Only Tom.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulations. They might choose D) Neither is correct because they don't see how to get to either suggested line correctly, or they might mistakenly think Katie's method could be right due to a lack of understanding of how to isolate \(x\). A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple mistakes. They are likely to recognize Tom's method as correct but might be confused by Katie's. However, they might not catch the mistake in Katie's suggestion as readily. A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebraic manipulations well and can see that Tom's suggestion is correct. They will likely identify Katie's suggestion as incorrect. A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and can easily identify the correct manipulation. They will see Tom's suggestion as correct and Katie's as incorrect. A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%.

## 6: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
