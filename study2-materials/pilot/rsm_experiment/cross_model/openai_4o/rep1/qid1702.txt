To determine the answer, we should evaluate the equation \( 10x - 6y = 30 \) given the y-value \( y = 0.5 \):

\[
10x - 6(0.5) = 30 
\]
\[
10x - 3 = 30 
\]
\[
10x = 33 
\]
\[
x = 3.3
\]

Hence, the correct option should be C, which is 3.3. Now, we'll consider the likelihood of students selecting different options based on their ability level:

**Below Basic**:\
A common error for below basic students is not substituting correctly or misinterpreting distributive properties, spacing, and attention span.
A = 25% \
B = 25% \
C = 20% \
D = 30%

**Basic**:\
At this level, students may struggle with multi-step calculations in algebra.
A = 20% \
B = 10% \
C = 35% \
D = 35%

**Proficient**:\
With moderated incline tasks performed correctly, more students comprehend thus reducing randomized selections.
A = 10% \
B = 5% \
C = 75% \
D = 10%

**Advanced**:\
Advanced students should adequately substitute correctly—higher compliance follows clear understanding.
A = 5% \
B = 0% \
C = 90% \
D = 5%

So, the distribution can be summarized effectively as `below_basic`, `basic`, `proficient`, and `advanced`.
