To solve the question accurately, it tests students' understanding of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS - Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction). In this expression:

\[ 3-5+4 \times 2 \]

- The multiplication should be performed first: \(4 \times 2 = 8\).
- Then evaluate the expression based on remaining operations from left to right: \( 3-5+8 = -2+8 = 6\).

Given this understanding, students of varying abilities will handle this differently based on their mastery of handling the BIDMAS principles, potential persisting misconceptions especially around operation priority and left-to-right calculations, or purely performing from immediate perception without considering roles of sustem, strategies otherwise trained:
