The question involves solving a basic linear equation and then simplifying a fraction, which are skills typically built in different stages of mathematical development. Here's a prediction for this question:

**Below Basic:**
Students who are at the below-basic level may have trouble with understanding how to solve a simple equation or with the necessary algebraic manipulation.

- A=30%
- B=40%
- C=20%
- D=10%

**Basic:**
These students may perform calculations correctly at times but might confuse procedures to untangle variables.

- A=10%
- B=60% (A common mistake could be not performing the inverse operations correctly)
- C=20%
- D=10%

**Proficient:**
Students at this level should correctly solve simple equations frecuently, but they might make occasional mistakes on tricky simplifications.

- A=5%
- B=10% 
- C=20%
- D=65% (Correct Answer: Simplification \( p = \frac{1}{36} \))

**Advanced:**
These students will typically manage computations and simplifications effortlessly.

- A=0%
- B=0%
- C=0%
- D=100%
