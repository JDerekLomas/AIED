## Step 1: Understand the question and the equation given
The equation provided is $y = 3x^{2}$, and we need to find the value of $y$ when $x = 0.3$. The correct calculation is $y = 3 \times (0.3)^{2} = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

## 2: Identify the wrong answers and the calculation errors leading to them
- Option A: $0.81$ could result from $3 \times (0.3)^{2} = 3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$ or simply misinterpreting the calculation, but actually, it seems more likely from $(0.3)^{2} = 0.9$ then $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$, indicating a possible confusion or a miscalculation in squaring $0.3$ or multiplying by $3$.
- Option B: $0.27$ is the correct answer as calculated in step 1.
- Option C: $1.8$ could come from $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ then mistakenly adding or multiplying by another factor, or directly $3 \times 0.6 = 1.8$ if one mistakenly uses $0.6$ instead of $0.3$ or incorrectly squares $0.3$ to $0.6$.
- Option D: $2.7$ could result from misinterpreting $(0.3)^{2}$ as $0.9$ and then $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$.

## 3: Analyze the errors for attractiveness and likelihood at different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of exponents. They might choose $0.81$ if they mistakenly calculate $0.3^2 = 0.9$ and then $3*0.9 = 2.7$ but write $0.81$ due to a calculation slip, or choose $1.8$ or $2.7$ through incorrect operations (e.g., $3*0.3=0.9$ then somehow getting to $1.8$ or $2.7$).
- **Basic**: Students here might make calculation mistakes like $0.3^2 = 0.09$ but then incorrectly multiply or add, likely falling into $0.27$ (correct), but with some chance of errors leading to $2.7$ if they see $0.3^2$ as $0.9$.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the operations but might make slips. They are less likely to fall into obvious traps but could still make minor calculation errors.
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to get it correct but might double-check their work.

## 4: Estimate percentages based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (simple miscalculation), B=30% (gets the correct simple calculation), C=20% (errors in operations), D=30% (common mistake).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=70%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: A=1%, B=98%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

Given the nature of the question and typical student errors, let's finalize:

The best answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%
