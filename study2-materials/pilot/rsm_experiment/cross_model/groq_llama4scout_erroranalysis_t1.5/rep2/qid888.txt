## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct method involves using the FOIL technique (First, Outer, Inner, Last) or the distributive property. The correct answer is \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 2: Identify common errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error is to forget to change the sign of one of the terms when multiplying, leading to \(m^2 - 7m + 5m - 35 = m^2 - 2m - 35\), which corresponds to option A.
- Another error could be adding the constants or the \(m\) terms incorrectly, or misapplying the signs.
- Option C, \(m^2 + 12m + 35\), might result from incorrectly adding the \(m\) terms with a wrong sign, \(m^2 + 7m + 5m + 35\).
- Option D, \(m^2 - 12m - 35\), could come from a correct multiplication but wrong addition of the constants, \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35\).

## 3: Analyze option A
Option A, \(m^2 - 2m - 35\), is likely to result from students who incorrectly apply the FOIL method, getting \(m^2 - 7m + 5m - 35\), which simplifies to \(m^2 - 2m - 35\). This error is quite common among students who are not fully confident in their algebraic manipulations.

## 4: Analyze option B
Option B, \(m^2 - 12m + 35\), is the correct answer. Students who are proficient in algebra and carefully apply the FOIL method or distributive property should arrive at this answer.

## 5: Analyze option C
Option C, \(m^2 + 12m + 35\), seems to arise from a misunderstanding of how to handle the negative signs when multiplying out the brackets, possibly \(m^2 + 7m + 5m + 35\), which would be a less common mistake but still plausible.

## 6: Analyze option D
Option D, \(m^2 - 12m - 35\), could result from a student correctly getting \(-7m - 5m = -12m\) but then incorrectly adding the constants to get \(-35\) instead of \(+35\), suggesting a calculation error.

## 7: Predict percentages based on student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to make significant errors. Option A seems attractive due to a simple calculation error (\(m^2 - 2m - 35\)), so A=40%, B=20% (some might get it right by chance), C=15%, D=25%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level might understand the concept but make calculation mistakes. A=30%, B=50% (as they start to get the concept right), C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students should mostly get it right but might make some careless errors. A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to get it right with minimal errors. A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.

## 8: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=50% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
