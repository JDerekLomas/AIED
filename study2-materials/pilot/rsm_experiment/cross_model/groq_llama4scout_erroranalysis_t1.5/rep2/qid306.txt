## Step 1: Analyzing Problem P
Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \). For this problem, the correct order of operations is to perform the operations from left to right since they are all addition and subtraction. Therefore, the correct calculation to do first is \( 4-5 \).

## 2: Analyzing Problem Q
Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), the correct calculation to do first is \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 3: Identifying Correct Answers
The correct approach for Problem P is to start with \( 4-5 \) and for Problem Q is to start with \( 5 \times 6 \). This matches option B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often lack understanding of basic mathematical operations and the order of operations. They might choose options that seem simplest or most straightforward without applying the correct rules. Option A seems plausible as it suggests starting with the first operation in both cases without considering the correct order of operations for Problem Q.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make simple errors. They are more likely to understand the sequence of operations in Problem P but might still struggle with applying it correctly in Problem Q, potentially leading to a mix of correct and incorrect choices.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand the order of operations and are likely to choose the correct option B, as they can apply the rules correctly to both problems.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the order of operations but can also apply it in more complex scenarios. They are also likely to choose option B.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: These students might not fully grasp the concept of order of operations. They could mistakenly think all operations should be done in the order they appear (leading to A) or incorrectly prioritize (C or D). Given the simplicity of the question, B might seem correct to some, but errors in understanding could lead to:
  - A: 30% (thinking to do all operations in sequence)
  - B: 20% (some understanding but not fully applied)
  - C: 20% (misunderstanding the operations to prioritize)
  - D: 30% (another incorrect prioritization)

- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp but might still make errors:
  - A: 10%
  - B: 60% (correct understanding and application)
  - C: 15%
  - D: 15%

- **Proficient**: Students with a good understanding are likely to get it right:
  - A: 5%
  - B: 80%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 10%

- **Advanced**: These students should almost universally understand and apply the order of operations correctly:
  - A: 2%
  - B: 90%
  - C: 2%
  - D: 6%

## 6: Converting to Requested Format
Given the estimates:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
- **advanced**: A=2% B=90% C=2% D=6%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=2% D=6%
