To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential errors.

## Step 1: Understand the correct solution
The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \(k\), we first multiply both sides by 4 to get \( 60 = 1 + k \). Then, we subtract 1 from both sides to get \( k = 59 \). Therefore, Step 1 is correct as it accurately represents multiplying both sides by 4, but Step 2 is incorrect because it incorrectly states \( k = 61 \) instead of \( k = 59 \).

## 2: Analyze potential errors for each option
- **Option A (Only step 1 is correct):** This would be the correct answer because Step 1 is indeed correct, but Step 2 is not.
- **Option B (Only step 2 is correct):** This is incorrect because Step 2 is wrong.
- **Option C (Both steps are correct):** This is incorrect because, although Step 1 is correct, Step 2 is not.
- **Option D (Both steps are incorrect):** This is incorrect because Step 1 is actually correct.

## 3: Consider calculation errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error might be misinterpreting the steps or making a calculation mistake. For instance, incorrectly solving for \(k\) in Step 2 by adding 1 to 60 and getting 61 instead of 59.
- Another error could be not checking the validity of each step, assuming both are correct or both are incorrect without verification.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and may not fully understand the process. They might choose **D (Both steps are incorrect)** because they don't see how to get from one step to the other correctly or **B (Only step 2 is correct)** if they mistakenly think Step 2 is right but can't verify Step 1.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They could choose **B (Only step 2 is correct)** if they incorrectly verify Step 2 or **C (Both steps are correct)** if they don't catch the mistake in Step 2.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the algebraic process. They are likely to choose **A (Only step 1 is correct)** if they correctly verify Step 1 but see the error in Step 2.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are likely to quickly identify the correctness of Step 1 and the incorrectness of Step 2, leading them to choose **A (Only step 1 is correct)**.

## 5: Assign percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic:** Might have a hard time with algebraic manipulations. \( A = 20\%\), \( B = 30\%\), \( C = 10\%\), \( D = 40\%\)
- **Basic:** Should recognize Step 1 is correct but might struggle with verifying Step 2. \( A = 40\%\), \( B = 25\%\), \( C = 15\%\), \( D = 20\%\)
- **Proficient:** Likely to identify Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect. \( A = 60\%\), \( B = 10\%\), \( C = 5\%\), \( D = 25\%\)
- **Advanced:** Expected to accurately assess both steps. \( A = 80\%\), \( B = 5\%\), \( C = 0\%\), \( D = 15\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%
