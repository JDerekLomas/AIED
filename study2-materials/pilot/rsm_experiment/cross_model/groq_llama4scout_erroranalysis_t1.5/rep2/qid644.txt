## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks for the product of two terms indicated by arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## 2: Identify the correct answer
The correct answer is \(+4\), which corresponds to option A.

## 3: Analyze potential errors for each wrong option
- Option B (\(-4\)): This would result from a calculation error where the student forgot that multiplying two negatives gives a positive. The error here is not applying the rule for multiplying negative numbers.
- Option C (\(+5\)): This doesn't logically follow from a simple multiplication error of \(-1 \times -4\). It might come from adding or another operation not directly related to the multiplication of \(-1\) and \(-4\).
- Option D (\(-5\)): Similar to option C, it doesn't directly follow from a straightforward error in multiplying \(-1\) and \(-4\).

## 4: Consider the attractiveness of each wrong answer
- Option B (\(-4\)) is an attractive error because it results from simply multiplying \(-1\) by \(-4\) without considering the sign change, which can be a common oversight.
- Options C (\(+5\)) and D (\(-5\)) are less directly related to the multiplication of \(-1\) and \(-4\), suggesting they might come from more significant misunderstandings or miscalculations.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication, especially with negative numbers. They might choose B (\(-4\)) because they forget the rule about multiplying negatives, or they might choose randomly. Option B seems plausible as it shows some understanding of multiplication but not of negative number rules.
- **Basic**: Students here should understand multiplication but might still make simple errors. They are likely to choose A (\(+4\)) but might fall for B (\(-4\)) if they forget the sign rule.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the rules for multiplication, including with negative numbers. They are less likely to choose B (\(-4\)) and should mostly choose A (\(+4\)).
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand but can apply concepts accurately. They should predominantly choose A (\(+4\)).

## 6: Estimate percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below_basic**: A=40% (some understanding but careful), B=30% (common error), C=10%, D=20% (lack of understanding leading to random or incorrect choices).
- **Basic**: A=70%, B=20%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=90%, B=5%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
