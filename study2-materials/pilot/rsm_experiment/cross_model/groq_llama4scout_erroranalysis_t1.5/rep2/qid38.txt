To approach this question, let's first understand the common errors students might make when trying to add these fractions.

The correct method to add these fractions is to find a common denominator, which in this case is \(2x\), and then add them:
\[
\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}
\]

## Step 1: Identify the calculation error for each wrong answer
- Option B (\(\frac{7}{3x}\)) might result from incorrectly finding a common denominator or adding the numerators and denominators separately without finding a common base.
- Option C (\(\frac{11}{x}\)) could result from adding the fractions as if they already had a common denominator of \(x\), not properly accounting for the \(2x\) in the first fraction.
- Option D (\(\frac{7}{2x}\)) might come from incorrectly adding the numerators (3 + 4 = 7) without adjusting for the common denominator.

## 2: Determine the attractive errors
- The error leading to Option C (\(\frac{11}{x}\)) seems particularly attractive because it involves a straightforward addition of the numerators (3+4=7, then mistakenly 7+4=11 or simply not adjusting for 2x) and ignoring the denominator difference, which might feel natural to students who struggle with finding common denominators.

## 3: Assess which students catch themselves vs. fall into the trap
- Students at the lower end (below_basic and basic) are more likely to fall into traps because they might not fully understand the concept of finding a common denominator or might make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- Students who are proficient or advanced are less likely to make these errors but might still slip up if they're under pressure or not fully focused.

## 4: Estimate the percentages based on common mistakes
- **Below Basic**: These students often lack a basic understanding of fraction addition. They might choose Option B or C due to simple addition mistakes or not understanding common denominators. Option C (\(\frac{11}{x}\)) seems especially plausible as it reflects a misunderstanding of denominators. Let's estimate: A=20% (some might get it right by luck), B=30%, C=40%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle. They might be more likely to choose A (\(\frac{11}{2x}\)) if they've seen the method before but struggle to recall it. Let's estimate: A=40%, B=25%, C=25%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept and are more likely to get it right or make less obvious mistakes. Let's estimate: A=60%, B=15%, C=15%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to get it right. Let's estimate: A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.

The best answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
