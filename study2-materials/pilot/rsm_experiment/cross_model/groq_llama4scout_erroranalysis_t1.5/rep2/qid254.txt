To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls in the calculations.

The question requires students to calculate the mean of the numbers 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. The correct formula for the mean is the sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers. So, the correct calculation is \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \).

## Step 1: Identify the correct answer and its calculation.
The correct calculation is \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \). This matches option A, which is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) but is incorrect because it misses the 0. However, let's evaluate the other options based on common mistakes.

## 2: Analyze option A.
Option A, \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \), is incorrect because it excludes the 0 from the sum. Students who are not careful with including all numbers in the sum might choose this.

## 3: Analyze option B.
Option B, \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \), suggests adding the numbers first and then dividing by 5, which is the correct order of operations but as written, it implies \( 0+1+3+4 + (7 \div 5) \), which is incorrect due to the division before addition. Students might choose this if they misunderstand the order of operations or are tricked by its seeming correctness.

## 4: Analyze option C.
Option C, \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \), is incorrect because it divides by 4 (the number of terms excluding the 0) instead of 5. Students who forget to include 0 in the count of numbers might choose this.

## 5: Analyze option D.
Option D, "None of them," would be correct if all provided calculations were incorrect.

## 6: Predicting student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of statistical terms. They are likely to fall into traps. Option B might seem attractive because it follows a seemingly correct order of operations without realizing the error in division before addition. Option C could also be appealing due to its simplicity. A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level understand basic concepts but might make careless mistakes. They could choose A because it looks like a mean calculation but are less likely to fall for B due to a better grasp of operations. C remains a potential choice. A=40%, B=15%, C=30%, D=15%.
- **Proficient:** These students have a good grasp of mathematical concepts and are less likely to make simple arithmetic mistakes. They should recognize A as incorrect due to the missing 0 but might still consider it. B is less likely to be chosen due to understanding of operations. A=10%, B=5%, C=10%, D=75%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong understanding and are meticulous. They should easily identify A as incorrect and B as flawed. They are less likely to choose C. A=5%, B=0%, C=5%, D=90%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=10% D=75%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=5% D=90%
