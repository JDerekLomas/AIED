## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential errors.
The question requires students to evaluate two proposed next steps in solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\). Tom suggests \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), and Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\). To assess who is correct, we need to understand the correct method and common errors.

## 2: Solve the equation to understand the correct next steps.
First, let's solve the equation correctly to validate Tom's and Katie's suggestions:
\(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\)
Adding 5 to both sides gives:
\(\frac{x}{3} = 17\)
This validates Tom's suggestion.

To see if Katie's suggestion is valid, let's manipulate the original equation:
\(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\)
Multiplying every term by 3 to clear the denominator:
\(x - 15 = 36\)
Adding 15 to both sides:
\(x = 51\)

Katie's suggestion is \(x - 5 = 36\), which would imply \(x = 41\), not \(x = 51\). So, Katie's suggestion does not correctly solve the equation.

## 3: Analyze potential calculation errors and attractive wrong methods.
- Tom's method is correct as it directly addresses the equation by isolating \(x/3\).
- Katie's method involves multiplying by 3, which is a correct step but she applies it incorrectly by not multiplying the \(-5\) by 3, leading to \(x - 5 = 36\) instead of \(x - 15 = 36\).

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand how to solve equations or might make significant errors. They might choose D (Neither is correct) because they don't understand either method, or they might randomly select an option without understanding. Option A (Only Tom) seems plausible for some as it's closer to a correct manipulation. However, the lack of understanding might lead to a spread across options, but with a bias towards incorrect options due to confusion.

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of equation solving. They might recognize Tom's method as correct but struggle with Katie's. They could see Katie's as an attempt to get rid of the fraction but not fully executed correctly. This group might lean towards A (Only Tom) as they see the direct addition to isolate \(x/3\), and some might mistakenly think Katie's could be right due to a similar misunderstanding.

- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand equation solving and can see that Tom's method is correct. They might be tricked by Katie's attempt but quickly realize the mistake in her step (not multiplying -5 by 3). This group is likely to choose A (Only Tom) as they understand the correct process.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the correct method but can also quickly identify errors in reasoning. They will easily see Tom's suggestion as correct and Katie's as incorrect due to the flawed multiplication. This group will likely choose A (Only Tom).

## 5: Assign percentages based on predicted student responses.
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20% (confusion and lack of understanding lead to a spread)
- **Basic**: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10% (some understanding but errors in execution or interpretation)
- **Proficient**: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5% (clear understanding with minor errors)
- **Advanced**: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5% (strong understanding with rare errors)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
