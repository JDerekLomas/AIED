## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to compare two expressions: $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$. To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction).

## 2: Calculating the Expressions
First, calculate $8+12 \div 4$:
- Division first: $12 \div 4 = 3$
- Then addition: $8 + 3 = 11$

Next, calculate $(8+12) \div 4$:
- Evaluate inside the brackets: $8 + 12 = 20$
- Then division: $20 \div 4 = 5$

## 3: Comparing the Expressions
Now, compare the results: $11$ and $5$. Since $11 > 5$, the correct symbol to use is $>$.

## 4: Analyzing Potential Errors
- A common error is to ignore the order of operations. For $8+12 \div 4$, some might calculate $8 + 12 = 20$ and then $20 \div 4 = 5$, incorrectly making the two expressions equal or assuming the wrong relationship due to this mistake.
- Another error could be misinterpreting the expressions or making calculation mistakes.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand the order of operations or make significant calculation errors. They might think $8+12 \div 4 = 5$ (by adding first) and $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$, leading them to choose $C$ or not understand the question fully. Given their potential confusion, they might be more likely to choose $C$ (incorrectly thinking the expressions are equal) or $B$ if they mistakenly calculate one expression as less than the other without correctly solving them.
- **Basic**: These students understand the basics of the order of operations but might make minor calculation errors. They are likely to calculate $8+12 \div 4$ correctly as $11$ but might struggle with what the comparison means, potentially choosing $A$ if they correctly calculate both but forget to compare properly, or $C$ if they make a calculation mistake leading them to believe the expressions are equal.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level are likely to calculate both expressions correctly ($11$ and $5$) and understand the comparison, leading them to choose $A$ ($>$). However, some might still fall into traps if they miscalculate one of the expressions.
- **Advanced**: These students are expected to not only calculate correctly but also understand the implications of the order of operations clearly. They should overwhelmingly choose $A$.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some get it right by chance or simple calculation), B=30% (mistakenly think the first is less), C=40% (think they are equal due to incorrect calculation), D=10% (unlikely to consider inequalities properly).
- **Basic**: A=50% (correct calculation and understanding), B=20% (miscalculation leading to incorrect comparison), C=25% (think equal due to error), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Proficient**: A=70% (correct), B=10% (small mistake), C=15% (error making them think equal), D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=90% (clear understanding), B=5%, C=4%, D=1%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=4% D=1%
