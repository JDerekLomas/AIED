## Step 1: Understand the question and the options
The question requires evaluating the expression \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). To solve it, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). So, the correct steps are: multiplication first (\(4 \times 2 = 8\)), then addition and subtraction from left to right (\(3 - 5 + 8\)).

## 2: Calculate the correct answer
Following BIDMAS:
1. \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. \(3 - 5 = -2\)
3. \(-2 + 8 = 6\)

So, the correct answer is A) \(6\).

## 3: Analyze potential errors for each wrong option
- Option B) \(4\): This could result from \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\) then \(2 \times 2 = 4\), which is a misapplication of operations or misunderstanding of the expression.
- Option C) \(-12\): This could come from \(-5 + 4 = -1\), then \(3 \times -1 = -3\) and \(-3 \times 2 = -6\), or simply incorrect handling of operations, not following BIDMAS.
- Option D) \(-10\): This could result from \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 = 2\), and \(2 \times 2 = 4\), or more likely, directly calculating \(3 - 5 = -2\), \(4 \times 2 = 8\), but then incorrectly combining as \(-2 + 8 = 6\) is correct, possibly a miscalculation like \(-2 - 8 = -10\).

## 4: Identify calculation errors leading to each wrong answer
- B) \(4\): Incorrectly evaluating as \( (3 - 5 + 4) \times 2 \) or similar misinterpretation.
- C) \(-12\): Could result from miscalculating \(3 - 5 + 8\) as \(3 - (5 + 8)\) or similar incorrect operation order.
- D) \(-10\): Might come from a wrong calculation like \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(4 \times 2 - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6\), but mistakenly thinking \(-2 - 8 = -10\).

## 5: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option based on ability levels
### below_basic:

- B) \(4\): \(25\%\) (misinterpreting operations)
- C) \(-12\): \(30\%\) (making significant calculation errors)
- D) \(-10\): \(25\%\) (other errors)

### basic:
- These students have a basic understanding but may still make errors.

- C) \(-12\): \(10\%\) (misapplication of operations)
- D) \(-10\): \(10\%\) (arithmetical errors)

### advanced:
- These students have a strong grasp of BIDMAS and are less likely to make errors.
- A) \(6\): \(90\%\) (correct application)
- B) \(4\): \(5\%\) (small mistakes)
- C) \(-12\): \(3\%\) (unusual errors)
- D) \(-10\): \(2\%\) (rare miscalculations)
