To approach this question, let's analyze the problems given and the common mistakes students might make, considering the calculation errors that lead to wrong answers and which methods are more "attractive" or prone to errors.

## Step 1: Understanding the Problems
Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \), and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). The correct order of operations for Problem P, following the rules of BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction), is to perform the operations from left to right since there are no brackets, orders, division, or multiplication, yielding \( 4-5+6 \) should be calculated as \( (4-5)+6 \) or simply from left to right: \( 4 - 5 = -1 \) then \( -1 + 6 = 5 \). For Problem Q, following BODMAS, multiplication should be done before addition, so \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) then \( 4 + 30 = 34 \).

## 2: Identifying Common Errors
- A common error in Problem P would be to add or subtract out of order, but given the simplicity, most students will follow the left-to-right approach correctly or make calculation mistakes rather than ordering mistakes.
- For Problem Q, a common error is to ignore the order of operations and do \( 4 + 5 = 9 \) then \( 9 \times 6 \), which is an incorrect application of the operations.

## 3: Analyzing Answer Choices
- A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \). This suggests doing the subtraction first in P (correct) and addition before multiplication in Q (incorrect).
- B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \). This is correct for both; in P, subtraction is correctly done first, and in Q, multiplication is correctly done before addition.
- C: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \). This suggests adding 5 and 6 first in P (incorrect) and adding before multiplying in Q (incorrect).
- D: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \). This suggests adding 5 and 6 first in P (incorrect) and correctly doing multiplication before addition in Q.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** These students often lack understanding of basic mathematical operations and the order of operations. They might choose C or A because they don't understand that in Problem P, \( 4-5 \) is the first step, and in Problem Q, multiplication should come before addition. **A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%**
- **Basic:** Basic students understand the concept of operations but might apply them inconsistently. They are more likely to recognize the correct order in simple problems but might still struggle with the abstract application. **A=15% B=40% C=25% D=20%**
- **Proficient:** These students have a good grasp of the order of operations and can apply them correctly in most situations. They would likely choose B as it's the correct application. **A=5% B=60% C=15% D=20%**
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the order of operations but can also apply it in more complex scenarios. They would almost certainly choose B. **A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%**

The best answer is below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=60% C=15% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%
