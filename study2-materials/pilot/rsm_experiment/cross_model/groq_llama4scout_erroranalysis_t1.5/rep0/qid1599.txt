To approach this question, let's first analyze the options and the common mistakes students might make.

The correct answer is A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), as it correctly represents \( c \div(h+4) \) using algebraic convention.

- Option B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \) might seem attractive to students who incorrectly add 4 to \( c \) in the numerator, possibly due to a misinterpretation of the operation or a careless mistake.
- Option C: \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \) could be chosen by students who incorrectly apply the division and then add 4, possibly due to misunderstanding the order of operations or not following algebraic conventions properly.
- Option D: \( \frac{h+4}{c} \) seems to be a reversal of the original expression, which might appeal to students who simply invert the fraction without understanding the operation being described.

## Step 1: Analyzing Common Mistakes
Students at different levels might make different types of errors. Those who are below basic might not understand the concept of algebraic expressions and division properly, leading to random or simplistic errors. Basic students might understand simple operations but struggle with combining them in expressions. Proficient students are likely to understand algebraic conventions but might make careless mistakes under pressure. Advanced students are generally familiar with algebraic conventions and less likely to make basic errors.

## 2: Predicting Errors for Each Level
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to choose options that reflect a lack of understanding of algebraic expressions. Option D (\( \frac{h+4}{c} \)) might seem appealing due to its simplicity and misunderstanding of division. Option B (\( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)) could also be chosen due to an incorrect addition. 
- **Basic**: Students at this level might be tempted by option C (\( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)) because it represents a more straightforward mathematical operation they might be familiar with, but not necessarily in the context of algebraic expressions.
- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to understand the algebraic convention and choose A, but might be tempted by B due to careless mistakes or misunderstanding the division.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are expected to have a firm grasp of algebraic conventions and are less likely to choose incorrect options.

## 3: Assigning Percentages
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (some understanding but easily confused), B=25% (misinterpretation of expression), C=20% (simple operational mistake), D=25% (complete misunderstanding).
- **Basic**: A=50% (correct understanding), B=20% (adding in numerator), C=20% (misunderstanding division), D=10% (inversion mistake).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (strong understanding), B=10% (careless mistake adding 4), C=5% (misoperation), D=5% (inversion).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (clear understanding), B=3% ( rare mistake), C=1% (unlikely misoperation), D=1% (unlikely inversion).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
