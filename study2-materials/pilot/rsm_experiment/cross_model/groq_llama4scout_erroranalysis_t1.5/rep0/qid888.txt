## Step 1: Understand the question and the common mistakes
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct answer can be found using the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last), which yields \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\). This corresponds to option B.

## 2: Identify potential calculation errors for each wrong option
- Option A: \(m^2 - 2m - 35\). This could arise from incorrectly adding the \(m\) terms: \(-7m + 5m = -2m\), instead of \(-7m - 5m = -12m\).
- Option C: \(m^2 + 12m + 35\). This might come from adding the \(m\) terms incorrectly and also mishandling the signs: \(-7m - 5m = +12m\), which is incorrect.
- Option D: \(m^2 - 12m - 35\). This error could come from keeping the wrong sign for the constant term when multiplying: \(+35\) becomes \(-35\).

## 3: Analyze the attractiveness of each wrong method
- Option A feels somewhat natural for students who struggle with combining like terms, as it involves a simpler subtraction that might seem correct at first glance.
- Option C is less likely because it requires a double mistake: both adding the \(m\) terms to get a positive \(12m\) and keeping the constant term positive.
- Option D might seem plausible for students who rush or are not careful with signs.

## 4: Consider student ability levels and error likelihood
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to make careless mistakes and not fully understand the FOIL method. They might opt for A or D due to simple arithmetic errors.
- **Basic**: Students here understand the method but might struggle with arithmetic. They could easily fall into the trap of A.
- **Proficient**: These students know the method but might make minor errors. They are less likely to choose C or D but could still opt for A if they're hasty.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are familiar with the FOIL method and less likely to make significant errors, making B the most likely choice.

## 5: Predict percentages based on ability levels
Given the nature of the errors and assuming a normal distribution of ability:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple error), B=20% (correct but struggled), C=20% (double mistake), D=30% (sign error).
- **Basic**: A=40% (common mistake), B=40% (correct), C=10% (less common), D=10% (less common).
- **Proficient**: A=20% (occasional lapse), B=70% (correct), C=5% (unlikely), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (rare mistake), B=90% (correct), C=2.5% (very unlikely), D=2.5% (very unlikely).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=40% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2.5% D=2.5%
