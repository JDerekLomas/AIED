To approach this question, let's first understand what the correct calculation for the mean is and then analyze each option given.

The mean of a set of numbers is calculated by adding all the numbers together and then dividing by the count of numbers. For the given set \(0, 1, 3, 4, 7\), the correct calculation for the mean is:
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = 3
\]

## Step 1: Analyze Option A
Option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). This option is incorrect because it excludes the 0 from the sum, which is a necessary part of calculating the mean.

## 2: Analyze Option B
Option B is \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \). This option suggests adding the numbers together but then implies division by 5 only for the 7, due to the order of operations (division before addition). This would be a common mistake due to incorrect application of order of operations.

## 3: Analyze Option C
Option C is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \). This option incorrectly excludes the 0 from the sum and also divides by 4 (the number of non-zero values) instead of 5 (the total number of values).

## 4: Analyze Option D
Option D is "None of them". For this to be correct, all other options must be incorrect.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of mean or might make basic calculation errors. They might be attracted to options that seem simple or familiar.
  - A: XX% - Some might choose this because it looks like a mean calculation but is incomplete.
  - B: XX% - This could appeal due to its simplicity and mistaken application of operations.
  - C: XX% - Might seem right because it calculates a sum and then divides, but with incorrect division.
  - D: XX% - Few might realize none are correct if they understand the basic concept.

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of the mean concept but might make errors in application.
  - A: XX% - Some might miss the 0.
  - B: XX% - Attractive due to mistaken operation order.
  - C: XX% - Error in counting numbers.
  - D: XX% - More might realize the error if they understand basic calculation.

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept but might make minor errors under pressure.
  - A: XX% - Fewer would miss the 0.
  - B: XX% - Less likely to confuse operation order.
  - C: XX% - Understand counting error.
  - D: XX% - Many would correctly identify none as correct if they spot errors.

- **Advanced**: These students are confident and accurate in their calculations.
  - A: XX% - Very few would choose this as incorrect.
  - B: XX% - Understand operation order.
  - C: XX% - Recognize counting error.
  - D: XX% - Most would choose this if they verify calculations.

## 6: Estimated Percentages
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (seems like a calculation), B=40% (simple addition then division), C=20% (excludes 0 and divides by wrong number), D=10% (recognize error).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=10%, C=10%, D=75%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=5%, C=5%, D=90%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=10% D=75%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=5% D=90%
