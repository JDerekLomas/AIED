## Step 1: Understand the question and the order of operations
The question requires the application of the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right) to simplify the expression \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). The correct calculation following this order is: \(4 \times 2 = 8\), then \(3 - 5 = -2\), and finally \(-2 + 8 = 6\).

## 2: Identify the wrong answers and the calculation errors leading to them
- Option A: \(6\) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \(4\) could result from \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\) then \(2 \times 2 = 4\), or simply incorrect handling of operations.
- Option C: \(-12\) could result from \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 = 2\), and \(2 \times 2 = 4\) is not correct; possibly \(-2 \times 4 \times 2 = -16\) or similar incorrect calculation, but one plausible mistake is \(-5 + 3 = -2\), \(4 \times 2 = 8\), then \(-2 + 8 = 6\) is correct, not \(-12\); actually, \(-2 \times 4 + 2 \times 2 = -8 + 4 = -4\) does not lead to \(-12\).
- Option D: \(-10\) seems to come from incorrect application of operations: \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\), then \(2 \times 2 = 4\) does not lead to \(-10\), but \(3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 = 3 - 9 \times 2 = 3 - 18 = -15\) is not an option; a straightforward mistake could be \(3 - 5 = -2\) then \(-2 + 4 = 2\) and \(2 \times 2 = 4\), not \(-10\).

## 3: Analyze specific calculation errors
- A common mistake would be to perform operations from left to right without following BODMAS: \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 = 3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6\). 
- Another mistake could involve incorrect multiplication or addition/subtraction: For example, doing \(4 \times 2 = 8\), then \(5 + 8 = 13\), \(3 - 13 = -10\).

## 4: Consider the attractive errors
- Performing addition and subtraction before multiplication: \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\), then \(2 \times 2 = 4\). This leads to option B.
- Incorrectly applying operations: For instance, some might calculate \(3 - (5 + 4) \times 2\) which does not directly apply but could see calculations like \(3 - 9 \times 2 = -15\).

## 5: Estimate the percentage of students at each level who chose each option
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to make significant errors. They might do \(3 - 5 = -2\), then add \(4 \times 2 = 8\) but make errors like \(-2 + 8 = 10\) or simply calculate linearly: \(3 - 5 + 8 = 6\), so A seems attractive but errors abound. Expect a spread but likely high in B and D due to incorrect calculation orders.
- **Basic**: These students understand basic operations but may struggle with order of operations. They might get A, or mistakenly get B by doing \(3-5+4=2\) then \(2*2=4\).
- **Proficient**: Understand the order of operations. They are less likely to choose B, C, or D.
- **Advanced**: These students are strong and likely to choose A.

## 6: Make predictions based on typical student errors
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some get it right by chance), B=30% (incorrect order), C=10%, D=20% (linear calculation).
- **Basic**: A=60%, B=20%, C=5%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=85%, B=10%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: A=95%, B=4%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95
