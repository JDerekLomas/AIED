To approach this question, let's analyze the steps provided by Isaac and the potential errors students might make.

## Step 1: Understanding the Equation and Steps
The given equation is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \( k \), one should first multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which yields \( 60 = 1 + k \). This is indeed Step 1 provided by Isaac, making Step 1 correct.

## 2: Analyzing Step 2
From Step 1, \( 60 = 1 + k \), to solve for \( k \), one subtracts 1 from both sides, resulting in \( k = 59 \). However, Isaac's Step 2 states \( 61 = k \), which is incorrect because he added 1 instead of subtracting 1 from 60.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulation. They might see that Step 1 seems right but then incorrectly validate or invalidate steps based on a lack of understanding. Given the simplicity of the calculation, a significant portion might incorrectly choose B (Only step 2) if they mistakenly think adding or subtracting 1 from 60 gives 61 without properly checking. Some might choose D if they see both steps as incorrect due to confusion. A=30% (recognize Step 1 is correct), B=40% (incorrectly think Step 2 is right), C=10% (think both are correct, unlikely), D=20% (see both as wrong).

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to recognize Step 1 as correct but might struggle with the subtraction in Step 2. A=60% (correctly identify Step 1), B=25% (mistake in Step 2), C=5% (both correct, unlikely), D=10% (both incorrect).

- **Proficient**: These students understand the algebraic process. They should easily identify Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect. A=80% (correct), B=5% (unlikely to make such a basic error), C=0% (recognize the mistake in Step 2), D=15% (might see both as part of a process but recognize the error).

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only solve the equation correctly but also understand why each step is correct or incorrect. They will accurately assess both steps. A=90% (know Step 1 is correct), B=0% (unlikely), C=0% (know Step 2 is incorrect), D=10% (understand both steps' validity).

## 4: Assigning Percentages
Based on understanding and common errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=30%, B=40%, C=10%, D=20%
- **Basic**: A=60%, B=25%, C=5%, D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=80%, B=5%, C=0%, D=15%
- **Advanced**: A=90%, B=0%, C=0%, D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
