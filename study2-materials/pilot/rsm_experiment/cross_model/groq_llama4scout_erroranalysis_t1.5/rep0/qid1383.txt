## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential errors
The question requires students to substitute \( k = -3 \) into the equation \( T = k^4 \) and solve for \( T \). The correct calculation is \( T = (-3)^4 = 81 \).

## 2: Identify potential calculation errors for each wrong answer
- Option B (12) could result from \( (-3)^4 \) being mistakenly calculated as \( -3 \times 4 = -12 \) or a miscalculation of \( 3^4 = 81 \) then incorrectly adjusting for the negative sign.
- Option C (-81) might come from \( (-3)^4 \) being calculated as \( -3^4 \), ignoring the even exponent that makes the result positive.
- Option D (-12) seems less likely as it suggests a confusion between exponentiation and multiplication.

## 3: Analyze the errors for attractiveness and likelihood at different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic substitution and exponent rules. They might incorrectly calculate \( (-3)^4 \) as \( -3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3 \) which actually yields 81, but could easily make mistakes like \( -3 \times 4 = -12 \) (leading to D) or simply not understand the exponentiation properly.
- **Basic**: At this level, students understand basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They could mistakenly think \( (-3)^4 = -3^4 \) (leading to C) or miscalculate the power.
- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to understand the rules of exponents, including \( (-a)^n \) being positive for even n. However, they might still fall into traps if they're not paying close attention, such as mistakenly calculating \( k^4 \) as \( 4k \) or similar simple errors.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a solid grasp of algebraic concepts, including exponent rules. They are less likely to make simple errors but could potentially overthink the problem.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
- **Below Basic**: 
  - A (81): 30% (some get it right by chance or basic understanding)
  - B (12): 20% (misunderstanding of exponentiation)
  - C (-81): 30% (not understanding even exponents make negatives positive)
  - D (-12): 20% (confusing with multiplication or other operations)

- **Basic**:
  - A (81): 60% (understand exponent rules but might make careless mistakes)
  - B (12): 10% (simple miscalculation)
  - C (-81): 20% (misunderstanding exponent properties)
  - D (-12): 10% (less likely but possible through confusion)

- **Proficient**:
  - A (81): 85% (solid understanding of exponents)
  - B (12): 5% (uncommon mistake)
  - C (-81): 5% (rarely misunderstand even exponents)
  - D (-12): 5% (unlikely mistake)

- **Advanced**:
  - A (81): 95% (excellent understanding)
  - B (12): 2% (very rare mistake)
  - C (-81): 2% (rare mistake)
  - D (-12): 1% (extremely unlikely)

## 5: Convert predictions into the required format
Given the predictions:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- **basic**: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
