## Step 1: Understand the question and the required calculation
The question asks students to simplify the expression \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\) into a single fraction as simply as possible.

## 2: Identify the correct method for solving the problem
To add these fractions, students need to find a common denominator, which in this case is \(2x\). The expression \(\frac{4}{x}\) can be rewritten as \(\frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{8}{2x}\). Then, \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}\).

## 3: Analyze potential errors leading to wrong answers
- Option A: \(\frac{11}{2x}\) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \(\frac{7}{3x}\) suggests a mistake where the student incorrectly found a common denominator or added the numerators and denominators separately without finding a common base.
- Option C: \(\frac{11}{x}\) implies the student ignored the \(2\) in the \(2x\) denominator of the first fraction when finding a common denominator.
- Option D: \(\frac{7}{2x}\) suggests a calculation error where the student added \(3 + 4 = 7\) but correctly used \(2x\) as the denominator.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option
### below_basic
Students at this level often struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and fractions. They might add the numerators and denominators directly or fail to find a common denominator.
- A: \(20\%\) (some might get it right by chance or simple addition)
- B: \(30\%\) (attracted to simple addition: \(3+4=7\), \(2+x=3x\))
- C: \(30\%\) (ignoring the \(2\) in \(2x\): \(3+4=7\), denominator \(x\))
- D: \(20\%\) (simple addition but correct denominator)

### basic
Students at this level understand basic concepts but may make careless mistakes.
- A: \(40\%\) (understand common denominator but might make calculation mistakes)
- B: \(20\%\) (still struggling with common denominators)
- C: \(25\%\) (common mistake of ignoring \(2\) in \(2x\))
- D: \(15\%\) (correct denominator but incorrect addition)

### proficient
Students at this level have a solid grasp of algebraic manipulations.
- A: \(70\%\) (correctly find common denominator and add)
- B: \(10\%\) (occasional mistake in finding common denominator or adding)
- C: \(10\%\) (occasionally ignore \(2\) in \(2x\))
- D: \(10\%\) (calculation mistake with correct denominator)

### advanced
Students at this level are confident and accurate in their algebraic manipulations.
- A: \(90\%\) (accurately simplify the expression)
- B: \(5\%\) (rare mistake, possibly due to rushing)
- C: \(3\%\) (rare oversight of \(2\) in \(2x\))
- D: \(2\%\) (rare calculation error)

## 5: Provide the predicted percentages in the required format
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
