To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential errors that could lead to each wrong answer.

The question asks for the product of the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Answer
The correct answer is \(+4\), which corresponds to option A.

## 2: Identifying Potential Errors
- Option B (\( -4 \)): This would result from a calculation of \(-1 \times 4\) or \(1 \times -4\), indicating a misunderstanding of the terms being multiplied or a sign error.
- Option C (\( +5 \)): This doesn't directly result from a simple multiplication error of \(-1\) and \(-4\), suggesting it might come from a more complex mistake or confusion with another part of the expansion.
- Option D (\( -5 \)): Similarly, this doesn't directly result from multiplying \(-1\) and \(-4\), indicating a potential for significant calculation or conceptual error.

## 3: Analyzing Errors by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication, especially with negative numbers. They might not understand that two negatives make a positive, leading them to choose B (\( -4 \)) because they forget the rule or misapply it. They are less likely to arrive at C or D through logical errors directly related to the question.
- **Basic**: Students here understand basic operations but might make careless mistakes. They could choose B if they mistakenly multiply \(-1 \times 4\) or similar. They are unlikely to choose C or D as these don't logically follow from simple errors in this specific calculation.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the operations but might get distracted or make minor errors. They are less likely to choose incorrect options because they know the rules, but some might still fall into traps if they misread the question or rush.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of the material and are less likely to make simple arithmetic errors.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some get it right by chance or basic understanding), B=50% (common error due to misunderstanding of negative multiplication), C=5% (unlikely but possible through confusion), D=5% (similarly unlikely).
- **Basic**: A=70% (better understanding but still prone to simple errors), B=25% (some still confuse negative multiplication), C=3% (unlikely), D=2% (unlikely).
- **Proficient**: A=90% (strong understanding, fewer errors), B=8% (minor errors), C=1% (very unlikely), D=1% (very unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=98% (high accuracy), B=1% (rare error), C=0.5% (extremely unlikely), D=0.5% (extremely unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=50% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=70% B=25% C=3% D=2%
proficient: A=90% B=8% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
