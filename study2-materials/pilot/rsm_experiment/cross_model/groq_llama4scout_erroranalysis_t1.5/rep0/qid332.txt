## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential errors
The question requires students to solve the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) and evaluate the correctness of two proposed next lines of working: Tom's \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\) and Katie's \(x - 5 = 36\). To assess the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, we need to consider the common errors and the attractiveness of each wrong method.

## 2: Identify the correct solution and proposed solutions
The correct next line of working to solve \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) would indeed be \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), which is Tom's suggestion. This is achieved by adding 5 to both sides of the equation. Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), seems to misunderstand the equation; multiplying every term by 3 would give \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\). Thus, only Tom is correct.

## 3: Analyze potential calculation errors for each wrong answer
- For option B (Only Katie), students might incorrectly believe that multiplying by 3 directly results in \(x - 5 = 36\), which would actually be \(x - 15 = 36\).
- For option C (Both Tom and Katie), students would need to incorrectly validate Katie's step as well.
- For option D (Neither is correct), students would need to see that both proposed steps are flawed.

## 4: Consider the attractiveness of wrong methods and student vigilance
- Tom's method is straightforward and correct, adding 5 to both sides.
- Katie's method might seem attractive to students who are not sure how to isolate \(x\) properly or who mistakenly apply operations to parts of the equation incorrectly.

## 5: Estimate percentages based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might find Katie's suggestion more "intuitive" or appealing because it seems to directly address \(x\), but they'll likely make errors in calculation. Option D might be appealing if they see both as incorrect but can't articulate why. Given their struggles, A=30% (partially correct but flawed understanding), B=40% (mistakenly think Katie's right), C=10% (lack understanding to assess), D=20% (see both as wrong but can't justify).
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to recognize Tom's solution but might be confused by Katie's. A=60% (recognize Tom's correctness), B=20% (partially understand but misapply), C=10% (some see both but incorrectly), D=10% (clearly see both as flawed).
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebra and are less likely to fall for incorrect steps. A=80% (clearly see Tom's correctness and Katie's flaw), B=5% (occasional careless mistake), C=5% (unlikely but possible confusion), D=10% (see through both but might question).
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand algebra but can also critically evaluate proposed solutions. A=90% (clear understanding and application), B=0% (unlikely to mistake Katie's), C=5% (extremely rare error), D=5% (will recognize both but know why).

## 6: Finalize the prediction
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
- **basic**: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
- **advanced**: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
