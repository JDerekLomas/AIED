## Step 1: Understand the question and the possible errors
The question requires students to evaluate two proposed next steps in solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\). Tom suggests \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), and Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\). To assess these, we need to understand the correct method and common errors.

## 2: Identify the correct next steps
To solve \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\), adding 5 to both sides yields \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), which matches Tom's suggestion. This is a correct step. For Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), we can see it as multiplying every term by 3: \(x - 15 = 36\), which does not directly match \(x - 5 = 36\). The correct multiplication by 3 would give \(x - 15 = 36\), implying Katie's step seems incorrect as presented because it doesn't properly account for multiplying the \(-\frac{15}{3}\) by 3.

## 3: Analyze Tom's suggestion
Tom's suggestion, \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), is correct because adding 5 to both sides of the original equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) results in \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This step is algebraically sound and straightforward.

## 4: Analyze Katie's suggestion
Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), implies multiplying the entire equation by 3: \(\frac{x}{3} \cdot 3 - 5 \cdot 3 = 12 \cdot 3\), which simplifies to \(x - 15 = 36\). Katie's \(x - 5 = 36\) doesn't match this; it seems to incorrectly apply the multiplication. The correct application would yield \(x - 15 = 36\), making Katie's suggestion as presented incorrect.

## 5: Determine the percentage of students at each level who choose each option
- **Below Basic**: These students may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not fully understand how to isolate \(x\), and could easily fall into traps. 
  - A (Only Tom): Might be chosen by students who see Tom's step as obviously correct but don't fully evaluate Katie's.
  - B (Only Katie): Could be chosen by those who misinterpret Katie's step or don't see its error.
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): Unlikely, as they should see at least one is incorrect.
  - D (Neither is correct): Might be chosen by those who see errors in both but aren't sure.

- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic algebra but might make careless errors.
  - A: Likely, as they see Tom's correct step.
  - B: Possible, if they misunderstand Katie's manipulation.
  - C: Unlikely, since they should recognize one step as incorrect.
  - D: Possible, especially if they identify errors in both.

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebra and can evaluate both steps.
  - A: Likely, recognizing Tom's step is correct and Katie's is not.
  - B: Unlikely, as they should see Katie's error.
  - C: Unlikely, because Katie's step is not correct as presented.
  - D: Unlikely, since Tom's step is correct.

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand but can also critically evaluate algebraic steps.
  - A: Very likely, as they clearly see Tom's step as correct and Katie's as incorrect.
  - B: Unlikely.
  - C: Unlikely, for the same reason.
  - D: Unlikely, as Tom is correct.

## 6: Assign percentages based on understanding of common errors and algebraic manipulation skills
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (recognize Tom's correctness), B=30% (misinterpret Katie), C=10% (unlikely both are correct), D=20% (see errors but unsure).
- **Basic**: A=60%, B=20%, C=5%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: A=90%, B=2%, C=2%, D=6%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=2% D=6%
