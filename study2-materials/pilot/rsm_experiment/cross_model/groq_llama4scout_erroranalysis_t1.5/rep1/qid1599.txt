To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential errors that lead to each wrong answer.

The correct calculation using algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \) is \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which corresponds to option A.

## Step 1: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \), suggests that students added 4 to \( c \) in the numerator, which could happen if they mistakenly thought the division applies to \( c \) and \( 4 \) separately or if they incorrectly expanded the expression. This error might seem attractive to students who are not confident with the order of operations or who are trying to "distribute" the division.

## 2: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \), indicates a misunderstanding of the order of operations, where students might have calculated \( c \div h \) first and then added 4. This could be an attractive error for students who are used to performing operations from left to right without considering the grouping implied by the parentheses.

## 3: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( \frac{h+4}{c} \), shows a complete reversal of the numerator and denominator and ignores the division by \( (h+4) \) altogether. This error might occur if students mistakenly swapped the dividend and divisor or did not understand that dividing by a quantity is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.

## 4: Ability Level Predictions
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic expressions or the correct order of operations. They are likely to choose options that reflect a basic misunderstanding. Option C (\( \frac{c}{h}+4 \)) and Option D (\( \frac{h+4}{c} \)) might seem plausible due to a lack of understanding of the algebraic convention, but Option B (\( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)) could also be attractive due to misconceptions about how to handle the division. Option A is likely to be chosen by a small percentage due to a lack of confidence in algebraic manipulations.

- **Basic:** At this level, students have a foundational understanding but may still make errors due to carelessness or misunderstanding of algebraic conventions. They might lean towards Option B or C due to lack of clarity on the correct algebraic expression.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand algebraic expressions but might still fall into traps if they're not vigilant. Option B might appeal due to misinterpretation of the division.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to have a strong grasp of algebraic conventions and should easily identify the correct answer as Option A. They are less likely to fall into the traps presented by the incorrect options.

## 5: Predicted Percentages
Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic:** A=20% (some might get it by chance or have a basic understanding), B=30% (misunderstanding of algebraic expressions), C=30% (incorrect order of operations), D=20% (complete misinterpretation).

- **Basic:** A=50% (understanding but might be cautious), B=25% (mistake in algebraic expression), C=20% (order of operations error), D=5% (less likely to make a complete reversal).

- **Proficient:** A=80% (strong understanding of algebraic conventions), B=10% (minor mistakes), C=5% (less common error), D=5% (unlikely).

- **Advanced:** A=95% (very confident in algebraic manipulations), B=3% (rare mistake), C=1% (very unlikely), D=1% (extremely unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
