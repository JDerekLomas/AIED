## Step 1: Understanding the Problems and Operations
First, let's analyze the problems given and the correct order of operations for each. Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \) and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). For Problem P, since it only involves addition and subtraction, we perform operations from left to right. Therefore, the correct order is to start with \( 4-5 \) and then add 6. For Problem Q, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), we must do the multiplication before addition, so \( 5 \times 6 \) should be calculated first.

## 2: Identifying Correct Answers
For Problem P, the correct calculation order is \( 4-5+6 \), which means doing \( 4-5 \) first (resulting in -1) and then adding 6, giving 5. The correct sequence of operations is indeed \( 4-5 \) then add 6. For Problem Q, \( 5 \times 6 \) must be done first, yielding \( 4 + 30 = 34 \). So, the correct approach is to do \( 5 \times 6 \) first.

## 3: Analyzing Option A
Option A suggests for Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and for Problem Q: \( 4+5 \). This option correctly identifies \( 4-5 \) for Problem P but incorrectly suggests \( 4+5 \) for Problem Q instead of \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 4: Analyzing Option B
Option B suggests for Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and for Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \). This option correctly identifies the operations for both problems: \( 4-5 \) for Problem P and \( 5 \times 6 \) for Problem Q, aligning with the correct order of operations.

## 5: Analyzing Option C
Option C suggests for Problem P: \( 5+6 \) and for Problem Q: \( 4+5 \). This option incorrectly identifies the operations for both problems. For Problem P, \( 5+6 \) should not be done first; \( 4-5 \) should. For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \) is incorrect; \( 5 \times 6 \) should be done first.

## 6: Analyzing Option D
Option D suggests for Problem P: \( 5+6 \) and for Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \). This option incorrectly suggests \( 5+6 \) for Problem P but correctly identifies \( 5 \times 6 \) for Problem Q.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often lack understanding of basic mathematical operations and their order. They might randomly select options or choose based on a single step they understand. Option B, being the correct answer, might not be appealing to them as they may not fully grasp the concept of order of operations. They might lean towards options that seem simple or familiar, such as A or C, but given the nature of the questions, B is likely to be less chosen by this group.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still struggle with applying the order of operations consistently. They might choose Option A because it seems to follow a straightforward left-to-right approach without fully considering the multiplication in Problem Q. Option B, being correct, might be chosen by those who have a slightly better grasp of the order of operations.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should understand and apply the order of operations correctly. They would likely choose Option B as it accurately reflects the correct operations to perform first in each problem.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can also explain and apply the order of operations with ease. They would definitely choose Option B.

## 8: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple and familiar), B=20% (some understanding), C=30% (random or incorrect understanding), D=20% (might seem complex).
- **Basic**: A=40% (attractive simple option), B=30% (understanding but not perfect), C=20% (less likely), D=10% (seems wrong).
- **Proficient**: A=10% (some might still be unsure), B=80% (correct understanding), C=5% (unlikely), D=5% (incorrect).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (no chance), B=90% (correct and confident), C=0% (incorrect), D=10% (might be considered but not chosen).

## 9: Finalizing Predictions
Based on typical student performance and understanding:
- **below_basic**: A=25% B=15% C=
