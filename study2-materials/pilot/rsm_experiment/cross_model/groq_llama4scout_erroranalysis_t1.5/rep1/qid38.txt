## Step 1: Identify the correct solution
To add these fractions, \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\), we need a common denominator, which in this case is \(2x\). So, we convert \(\frac{4}{x}\) to have the denominator \(2x\): \(\frac{4}{x} \cdot \frac{2}{2} = \frac{8}{2x}\). Then, we add them: \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}\).

## 2: Analyze option A
Option A is \(\frac{11}{2x}\), which is the correct answer. Students who are proficient or advanced in maths should easily arrive at this answer.

## 3: Analyze option B
Option B is \(\frac{7}{3x}\). This could result from a student incorrectly finding a common denominator or making a calculation error. For example, if a student tries to add the fractions by finding a common denominator but incorrectly calculates it as \(3x\) instead of \(2x\), and then incorrectly adds the numerators.

## 4: Analyze option C
Option C is \(\frac{11}{x}\). This could result from a student adding the fractions correctly to get \(\frac{11}{2x}\) but then simplifying incorrectly by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 2, which would actually lead to \(\frac{22}{2x}\) or simply not noticing the \(2\) in the denominator.

## 5: Analyze option D
Option D is \(\frac{7}{2x}\). This could result from a calculation error where the student adds \(3 + 4 = 7\) and keeps the \(2x\) as the denominator, not realizing the need to adjust the second fraction's numerator to match the common denominator.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to make significant errors. They might add the numerators directly without considering the denominators (leading to \(\frac{7}{2x}\) or \(\frac{7}{3x}\) if they mistakenly use \(3x\) as a common denominator) or not understand the concept of adding fractions with different denominators. So, they might choose D (incorrect addition) or B (incorrect common denominator).

- **Basic**: Basic students might understand the need for a common denominator but could make calculation errors. They are likely to choose A (correct), but some might fall into traps like D (\(\frac{7}{2x}\)) if they simply add the numerators without adjusting.

- **Proficient**: Proficient students should mostly choose A (\(\frac{11}{2x}\)) but might occasionally make careless errors leading to other options.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to choose A with very high accuracy.

## 7: Assign percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might get it by chance), B=30% (attractive error with incorrect common denominator), C=10% (less likely but possible if they over-simplify), D=40% (simple addition error).
- **Basic**: A=60% (mostly correct), B=15% (error with common denominator), C=10% (over-simplification), D=15% (simple error).
- **Proficient**: A=90% (mostly correct with some careless errors), B=5% (minor errors), C=3% (rare over-simplification), D=2% (rare simple errors).
- **Advanced**: A=98% (very high accuracy), B=1% (rare error), C=0.5% (very rare), D=0.5% (very rare).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
