## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to compare two expressions: $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$. To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 2: Calculating the Expressions
First, calculate $8+12 \div 4$. Following BODMAS, we do the division first: $12 \div 4 = 3$. Then, $8 + 3 = 11$.

## 3: Calculating the Second Expression
Next, calculate $(8+12) \div 4$. Following BODMAS, we do the operation inside the parentheses first: $8 + 12 = 20$. Then, $20 \div 4 = 5$.

## 4: Comparing the Expressions
Now, compare the two results: $11$ and $5$. Since $11 > 5$, the correct symbol to use is $>$.

## 5: Identifying Common Errors
- A common error would be to ignore the order of operations and calculate from left to right or incorrectly apply it, leading to choosing the wrong symbol.
- Another error could be misinterpreting the expressions or making calculation mistakes.

## 6: Analyzing Option A ($>$)
For students to choose $A= > $, they need to correctly calculate both expressions and understand the comparison, which is more likely for proficient and advanced students.

## 7: Analyzing Option B ($<$)
Choosing $B= < $ would indicate a misunderstanding of the comparison or a calculation error leading to the wrong relationship.

## 8: Analyzing Option C ($=$)
Choosing $C= =$ suggests that students believe the two expressions are equal, which could happen if they incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the order of operations.

## 9: Analyzing Option D ($\geq$)
Choosing $D= \geq $ implies that students think the first expression is greater than or equal to the second, which might be chosen by those who correctly identify the first expression is larger but are unsure about equality.

## 10: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to make significant calculation errors or not follow the order of operations correctly. They might choose $C= =$ (thinking the operations are the same) or $B= <$ (incorrectly calculating or comparing). $A= > $ seems unlikely but could happen with a lucky guess or partial understanding. $D= \geq $ might appeal to those unsure. Prediction: $A=20\%$ $B=30\%$ $C=30\%$ $D=20\%$
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still fall into traps. They could choose $C= =$ if they add first in both (8+12=20, then 20/4=5 and 8+(12/4) they might get 10, incorrectly), or $B= <$ if they miscalculate. $A=40\%$ $B=25\%$ $C=25\%$ $D=10\%$
- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations and are less likely to make basic calculation errors. They should predominantly choose $A= > $. $A=70\%$ $B=10\%$ $C=10\%$ $D=10\%$
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the operations but are also careful. They are likely to choose $A= > $ with a high confidence. $A=90\%$ $B=5\%$ $C=3\%$ $D=2\%$

## 11: Finalizing Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
- basic: A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
- proficient: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
- advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
