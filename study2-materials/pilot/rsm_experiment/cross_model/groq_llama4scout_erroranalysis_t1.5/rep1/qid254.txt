## Step 1: Understanding the task
To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, we first need to understand what each option implies in terms of calculating the mean of the given numbers: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7.

## 2: Identifying the correct calculation for the mean
The mean of a set of numbers is calculated by adding all the numbers together and then dividing by the count of the numbers. For the given set (0, 1, 3, 4, 7), the correct calculation for the mean is \( \frac{0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7}{5} \).

## 3: Analyzing option A
Option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). This option incorrectly excludes the 0 from the sum, which is a common error. Students might overlook the 0 or think it's not contributing to the sum.

## 4: Analyzing option B
Option B is \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \). This option incorrectly suggests dividing only the 7 by 5 and then adding the other numbers, which is a mistake due to incorrect application of order of operations.

## 5: Analyzing option C
Option C is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \). This option incorrectly includes all numbers in the sum but divides by 4 instead of 5, suggesting a student counted the numbers incorrectly.

## 6: Analyzing option D
Option D is "None of them". This would be correct if none of the provided calculations (A, B, C) correctly represent the mean.

## 7: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of mean. They are likely to choose options that seem simplest or most familiar, even if incorrect. Option B might be attractive due to its simplicity and attempt to apply operations in a seemingly logical (but incorrect) order.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make simple arithmetic or conceptual mistakes. They might choose A because it looks like a mean calculation but incorrectly omits 0, or C because it seems like a division by the number of values but is off by one.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of mean and can calculate it but might get distracted by seemingly simple or "obvious" answers. They are less likely to choose B or C due to understanding the need to include all numbers and divide by the correct count.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong understanding and are less likely to make simple mistakes. They would recognize A as almost correct but flawed due to the omission of 0.

## 8: Estimating percentages
Given the errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple but incorrect), B=40% (attractive due to simplicity), C=20% (basic mistake), D=10% (understanding that something is wrong but not sure what).
- **Basic**: A=40% (common mistake), B=25% (simple operation error), C=25% (counting error), D=10% (recognizing an error).
- **Proficient**: A=20% (aware but might slip), B=10% (less common now), C=5% (unlikely), D=65% (confidence in their understanding).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (unlikely), B=0% (correct order of operations understood), C=0% (counting correctly), D=95% (confident in identifying correct procedures).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
