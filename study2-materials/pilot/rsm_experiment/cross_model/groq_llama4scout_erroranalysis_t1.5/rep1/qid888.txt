## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct answer involves using the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) or expanding the brackets correctly.

## 2: Correct Calculation
To get the correct answer, we apply the FOIL method:
\[
(m-5)(m-7) = m \cdot m + m \cdot (-7) - 5 \cdot m - 5 \cdot (-7)
\]
\[
= m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35
\]
\[
= m^2 - 12m + 35
\]
So, the correct answer is B) \(m^{2}-12 m+35\).

## 3: Analyzing Wrong Answers
- A) \(m^{2}-2 m-35\): This could result from incorrectly adding the middle terms, e.g., \(-7m - 5m = -2m\) instead of \(-12m\).
- C) \(m^{2}+12 m+35\): This might come from adding the middle terms incorrectly and also misinterpreting the signs, e.g., \(-7m - 5m = +12m\).
- D) \(m^{2}-12 m-35\): This could result from incorrectly subtracting the product of the constants, e.g., \(+35\) becomes \(-35\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
## 4.1 Below Basic
Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not apply the FOIL method correctly or might confuse operations.
- A: High chance of selecting A due to simple miscalculation (\(m^{2}-2 m-35\)), 40%
- B: Lower chance since they might not reach the correct calculation, 20%
- C: Possible if they incorrectly add the terms and misinterpret signs, 20%
- D: Also possible due to confusion with signs or operations, 20%

## 4.2 Basic
At this level, students have a grasp of basic algebra but may make careless mistakes.
- A: Still a possibility due to straightforward calculation errors, 30%
- B: Higher chance of getting it right or nearly right, but errors in calculation could lead to other options, 40%
- C: Could happen with incorrect application of signs or operations, 15%
- D: Less likely but still possible with mistakes in signs, 15%

## 4.3 Proficient
Proficient students understand the FOIL method but might make occasional errors.
- A: Less likely as they understand the method but might miscalculate, 10%
- B: Most should get this right, 80%
- C: Unlikely but could happen with careful mistake, 5%
- D: Unlikely, similar reasoning as C, 5%

## 4.4 Advanced
Advanced students are less likely to make errors in such straightforward calculations.
- A: Very unlikely, 2%
- B: Very likely to get it right, 90%
- C: Highly unlikely, 4%
- D: Highly unlikely, 4%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=4% D=4%
