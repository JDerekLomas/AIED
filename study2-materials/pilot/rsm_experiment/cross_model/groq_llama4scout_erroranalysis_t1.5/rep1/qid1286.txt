## Step 1: Understand the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

## 2: Solve the volume formula for \(r\)
To find the radius \(r\) in terms of \(V\), we rearrange the formula:
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
\[V \cdot \frac{3}{4\pi} = r^3\]
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]

## 3: Identify the correct answer
Comparing the solved formula for \(r\) with the given options:
- The correct formula for \(r\) is \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\), which matches option C.

## 4: Analyze potential errors for each wrong option
- Option A: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V\pi}{3}}\) suggests a mistake where the \(\pi\) is not divided out and the \(4\) and \(3\) are swapped in the numerator and denominator, respectively.
- Option B: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}\) implies the mistake of not accounting for the \(\pi\) in the denominator properly and incorrectly swapping the \(4\) and \(3\).
- Option D: \(\frac{3\sqrt[3]{V}}{4\pi}\) suggests taking the cube root of \(V\) separately and then applying the rest of the formula incorrectly, not cubing the \(r\) in the volume formula properly.

## 5: Consider the attractiveness of each error
- Option A might seem attractive to students who incorrectly recall or apply the formula hastily.
- Option B could appeal to students who try to rearrange the formula but get the constants mixed up.
- Option D seems less likely as it involves a more significant conceptual misunderstanding.

## 6: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle with rearranging formulas and could easily fall into traps. They might choose A or D due to confusion (A=30%, B=20%, C=30%, D=20%).
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic concepts but might make careless mistakes. They could choose A or B due to simple algebraic errors (A=25%, B=25%, C=40%, D=10%).
- **Proficient**: These students have a good grasp of the concepts but might still make occasional mistakes. They are less likely to choose A or D but might opt for B if they misplace the \(\pi\) (A=15%, B=20%, C=60%, D=5%).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to get it correct or make very specific errors. They might choose B if they mistakenly recall the formula (A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%).

## 7: Convert predictions into the required format
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=25% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=20% C=60% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=25% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=20% C=60% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
