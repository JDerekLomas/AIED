To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option for the question \( T=k^{4} \) when \( k=-3 \), let's analyze the possible errors and the nature of the question.

## Step 1: Understand the Correct Calculation
The correct calculation is \( T = (-3)^{4} = 81 \), because \( (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = 81 \). This means option A is the correct answer.

## 2: Identify Potential Errors for Each Wrong Option
- Option B (12) could result from a calculation error such as \( (-3) \times 4 = -12 \) and then possibly confusing the power with multiplication, or simply adding/subtracting incorrectly.
- Option C (-81) might come from \( (-3)^{4} \) being mistakenly calculated as \( -3 \times -3 \times -3 \times -3 \) which actually equals 81, but if a student mistakenly applies the power to only the negative sign or misinterprets the order of operations, they might get this.
- Option D (-12) seems to result from mistakenly calculating \( (-3)^{4} \) as \( 4 \times (-3) \) or similar incorrect operations.

## 3: Analyze Calculation Errors Leading to Wrong Answers
- **Option B (12):** This could arise from mistakenly thinking \( k^{4} \) means \( k \times 4 \) or another form of confusion. It's less likely to be chosen by proficient or advanced students but could be attractive to those below basic or basic levels due to a lack of understanding of exponentiation.
- **Option C (-81):** This could result from calculating \( (-3)^{4} \) incorrectly by applying the exponent to only the negative part or misinterpreting the rule for even exponents making the result positive. This might trap students who are familiar with rules about negative numbers and powers but apply them incorrectly.
- **Option D (-12):** Similar to option B, this might come from confusion about what \( k^{4} \) means, possibly thinking it's \( 4k \) or \( k + 4 \), which could appeal to students who misunderstand basic algebra.

## 4: Consider Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** These students might not fully understand exponentiation or negative numbers. They could be drawn to simple addition/subtraction or multiplication errors (Options B and D).
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic grasp but might make careless mistakes or misunderstand the application of rules (Options B, C, D).
- **Proficient:** These students understand the rules but might occasionally make mistakes under pressure or if they're not fully focused (less likely to choose B or D, possibly C if they misread the question).
- **Advanced:** These students are less likely to make simple errors and should consistently choose A.

## 5: Estimate Percentages
Given the above, let's estimate:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (some get it right by chance or basic understanding), B=30% (simple miscalculation), C=20% (confusion with negative), D=30% (addition/subtraction confusion).
- **Basic:** A=60% (understand the concept but might make errors), B=20% (some still confuse with multiplication), C=10% (occasional mistake with negatives), D=10% (less common errors).
- **Proficient:** A=90% (strong understanding), B=5% (rare simple mistake), C=3% (occasional confusion), D=2% (very rare mistake).
- **Advanced:** A=98% (excellent understanding), B=1% (very rare mistake), C=0.5% (extremely rare), D=0.5% (extremely rare).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
