To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

## Step 1: Understanding the Equation and Steps
The given equation is \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\). To solve for \(k\), one would multiply both sides by 4 to get \(60 = 1 + k\), and then subtract 1 from both sides to get \(k = 59\).

## 2: Analyzing Isaac's Steps
Isaac's Step 1: \(60 = 1 + k\) is correct because multiplying both sides of the equation by 4 yields this result.
Isaac's Step 2: \(61 = k\) is incorrect because it incorrectly adds 1 to both sides instead of subtracting 1.

## 3: Identifying Calculation Errors and Attractive Mistakes
- The error in Step 2 (\(61 = k\)) comes from not subtracting 1 from both sides after getting \(60 = 1 + k\), which is a straightforward mistake.
- A common mistake might be misinterpreting the steps or not checking the solution, but given the straightforward nature of the calculation, errors are likely due to simple arithmetic mistakes.

## 4: Assessing Student Understanding
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and may not even attempt to verify Isaac's steps or might make simple arithmetic errors. They might choose \(B\) (Only step 2) if they incorrectly think Step 2 is right and don't understand why Step 1 is correct.
- **Basic**: Basic level students understand simple algebra but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to identify Step 1 as correct but might be confused about Step 2, potentially choosing \(A\) (Only step 1) if they see the mistake in Step 2.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should easily spot that Step 1 is correct and Step 2 is incorrect, leading them to choose \(A\) (Only step 1).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will not only correctly identify both steps but also understand why one is correct and the other is incorrect. They should choose \(D\) (Both steps are incorrect) because they see that while Step 1 is correct, Step 2 is not, but more accurately, they recognize Step 2's derivation is flawed.

## 5: Predicting Percentages
Given the nature of the question:
- **Below Basic**: Might not fully grasp the algebraic manipulation, so \(D\) seems less likely. \(A = 30\%\), \(B = 40\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 20\%\).
- **Basic**: Should see Step 1 as correct but might be tricked by Step 2, \(A = 50\%\), \(B = 25\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 20\%\).
- **Proficient**: Will likely see Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect, \(A = 70\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 15\%\).
- **Advanced**: Should understand the correctness of Step 1 and the error in Step 2, and be able to articulate that only Step 1 is correct or both are not fully correct as intended, \(A = 80\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 10\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
