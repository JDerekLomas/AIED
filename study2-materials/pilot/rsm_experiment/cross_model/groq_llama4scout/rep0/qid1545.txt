## Step 1: Understand the question and the common misconception
The question tests students' understanding of the order of operations, specifically the difference between expressions with and without parentheses. The common misconception here involves not following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right). A frequent error is to ignore the parentheses or to perform operations in the wrong order.

## 2: Analyze the expressions given
The expressions are \(8 + 12 \div 4\) and \((8 + 12) \div 4\). Following the order of operations:
- For \(8 + 12 \div 4\), we first do the division: \(12 \div 4 = 3\), then the addition: \(8 + 3 = 11\).
- For \((8 + 12) \div 4\), we first do the operation inside the parentheses: \(8 + 12 = 20\), then the division: \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 3: Compare the expressions
Now, comparing the results: \(11\) for \(8 + 12 \div 4\) and \(5\) for \((8 + 12) \div 4\). It's clear that \(11 > 5\), so the correct symbol to use is \(>\).

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may not understand or remember the order of operations. They might incorrectly perform the operations from left to right or ignore the parentheses entirely, leading to a variety of incorrect answers. However, given the simplicity of the numbers, some might still stumble upon the correct comparison through incorrect means. Expect a high level of incorrect responses, but let's assume some will guess or misunderstand in a way that leads them to choose \(<\), \(=,\) or \(\geq\).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with the order of operations. They might calculate \(8 + 12 \div 4\) as \(20 \div 4 = 5\) (incorrectly applying operations) or \((8 + 12) \div 4\) as \(8 + 3 = 11\) (similar mistake), leading to confusion. However, they are more likely to recognize the difference than below-basic students.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations and can apply it. They will likely correctly calculate both expressions and choose \(>\).

## 5: Estimate percentages for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (for those who incorrectly calculate but get the greater than relationship), B=20% (those who think the second is greater), C=20% (those who think they are equal), D=30% (those who are unsure or think it's greater than or equal to).
- **Basic**: A=50% (correct calculation leading to greater than), B=30% (miscalculation leading to less than), C=10% (equal), D=10% (greater than or equal to).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (correctly calculate and see it's greater than), B=10% (minor miscalculations), C=5% (think they are equal), D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=90% (easily and correctly calculate), B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.

## 6: Provide the final predictions in the required format
Given the previous step's assessments and refining them for clarity:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
