## Step 1: Understand the question and the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere. The task is to solve this formula for \(r\), given \(V\).

## 2: Solve the volume formula for \(r\)
Rearranging the formula to solve for \(r\):
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
\[V \cdot \frac{3}{4\pi} = r^3\]
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]

## 3: Compare the solved formula with the given options
Comparing \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\) with the options:
- A: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V\pi}{3}}\)
- B: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}\)
- C: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\)
- D: \(\frac{3\sqrt[3]{V}}{4\pi}\)

## 4: Identify the correct option
The correct formula for \(r\) matches option C: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\).

## 5: Analyze potential misconceptions and difficulty levels
- The question requires rearranging a formula, which can be challenging for students who are not confident in their algebraic manipulation skills.
- A common misconception might involve incorrectly rearranging the formula or forgetting the correct order of operations.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulation and could choose any option that seems plausible or might pick an option that incorrectly applies basic operations (e.g., A or D).
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the basic structure of the volume formula but could get confused during rearrangement, potentially choosing B or A due to misremembering the formula or mishandling the constants.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to correctly rearrange the formula and choose C. They might be less likely to choose A, B, or D because they understand the relationship between the volume formula and solving for \(r\).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are expected to not only solve the equation correctly but also to do so efficiently. They would likely choose C without hesitation.

## 7: Estimate percentages for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (guessing or misapplying), B=20% (similar reason), C=30% (some get it right by chance or partial understanding), D=20% ( incorrect application).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=25%, C=45%, D=10% (more inclined to get it right but still prone to errors).
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=10%, C=75%, D=5% (mostly correct but a few errors).
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=5%, C=90%, D=0% (very confident in their algebraic manipulations).

## 8: Convert estimates into the required format
Given the estimates:
- below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
- proficient: A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%
- advanced: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
