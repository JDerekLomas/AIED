## Step 1: Understand the question and the common misconception
The question asks students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). A common misconception when expanding brackets of this form is that students might add the numbers inside the brackets instead of multiplying them, or they might get the signs wrong.

## 2: Identify the correct answer
To expand \((m-5)(m-7)\), we use the FOIL method: First, Outer, Inner, Last. This gives \(m \times m + m \times -7 - 5 \times m - 5 \times -7 = m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\). So, the correct answer is B.

## 3: Analyze potential errors for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and making errors in signs or operations. They might incorrectly add or subtract inside the brackets or get the signs wrong. Option A (\(m^2 - 2m - 35\)) could be a result of incorrect calculation or misunderstanding of the FOIL method. Option C (\(m^2 + 12m + 35\)) could result from incorrectly adding the terms. Option D (\(m^2 - 12m - 35\)) might come from a mistake in handling the negative signs.

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple mistakes. They are likely to understand the FOIL method but might apply it incorrectly or make arithmetic errors.

- **Proficient**: These students have a good grasp of algebra and are less likely to make basic errors. However, they might still fall into traps if they're not paying close attention.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong understanding of algebraic manipulations and are less likely to make errors in expanding brackets.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
Given the nature of the question and common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple mistake, e.g., \(m^2 - 5m - 7m - 35\)), B=20% (correct but challenging), C=20% (adding instead of multiplying), D=30% (incorrect handling of negatives).
- **Basic**: A=15% (error in calculation), B=70% (correct application of FOIL), C=5% (misunderstanding), D=10% (sign error).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (careless mistake), B=90% (accurately applies FOIL), C=2% (rare mistake), D=3% (another rare mistake).
- **Advanced**: A=1% (very rare mistake), B=98% (easily and accurately expands), C=0.5% (extremely rare error), D=0.5% (extremely rare error).

## 5: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%
