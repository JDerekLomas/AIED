To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question asks to identify the correct algebraic convention for the expression \( c \div(h+4) \). The correct expression following algebraic conventions would be \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which matches option A.

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic notation and operations. They might confuse the order of operations or not fully understand the division by a sum. 
  - A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \) is the correct answer, but these students might not recognize it. 
  - B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \) could be chosen if they mistakenly add 4 to \(c\).
  - C: \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \) might be chosen if they incorrectly apply the division and then add 4.
  - D: \( \frac{h+4}{c} \) could be chosen if they reverse the numerator and denominator.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to misunderstanding the conventions or making calculation mistakes.
  - They are likely to recognize the correct form but might be tempted by incorrect options that seem plausible.

- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid grasp of algebraic conventions and are likely to choose the correct answer. However, some might still make errors if they misinterpret the notation.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding of algebraic expressions and are highly likely to choose the correct option without error.

Given these considerations, here's a rough estimate:

- **Below Basic**: A=40% (recognizing the correct format might be challenging but not impossible), B=25% (adding 4 to \(c\)), C=20% (wrongly applying operations), D=15% (reversing the fraction).
- **Basic**: A=70% (understanding the correct notation), B=15% (mistaking the addition), C=10% (incorrect operation), D=5% (reversing).
- **Proficient**: A=90% (strong understanding of algebraic notation), B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: A=98% (very strong grasp), B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

Thus, in the requested format:

below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
