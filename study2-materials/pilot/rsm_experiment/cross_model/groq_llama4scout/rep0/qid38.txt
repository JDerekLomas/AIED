## Step 1: Understand the question and the common misconception
The question requires students to add two fractions with different denominators: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \). A common misconception when adding fractions is to simply add the numerators and denominators separately or to forget to find a common denominator.

## 2: Determine the correct solution
To add these fractions, we first find a common denominator, which in this case is \(2x\), since \(x\) can be considered a factor of \(2x\). So, we rewrite \( \frac{4}{x} \) as \( \frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{8}{2x} \). Then, we add the fractions: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \).

## 3: Analyze the difficulty and potential misconceptions
The question seems straightforward, but the potential for error lies in not finding a common denominator or incorrectly adding the fractions. The common denominator here is \(2x\), and once that is established, the addition is straightforward.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with finding a common denominator or may add the numerators and denominators separately. They might choose \( B = \frac{7}{3x} \) (incorrect addition and finding a common denominator) or \( C = \frac{11}{x} \) (adding numerators and using \(x\) as the denominator). \( A = \frac{11}{2x} \) seems unlikely if they haven't grasped the concept. So, below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%.

- **Basic:** Students at this level should be able to find a common denominator but might still make careless mistakes. They are more likely to get \( A = \frac{11}{2x} \) correct but could be tempted by \( C = \frac{11}{x} \) if they forget the \(2\) in \(2x\). So, basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%.

- **Proficient:** These students should consistently find the correct common denominator and add the fractions correctly. They are likely to choose \( A = \frac{11}{2x} \) with high accuracy. So, proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and are less likely to make errors in simple algebraic manipulations. They should almost universally choose \( A = \frac{11}{2x} \). So, advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
