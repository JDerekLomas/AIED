To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing: the order of operations in mathematics, specifically the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule (Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction) or PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## Step 1: Understanding the Questions
Problem P: \( 4-5+6= \) - This problem involves addition and subtraction only, from left to right.
Problem Q: \( 4+5 \times 6= \) - This problem involves addition and multiplication.

## 2: Applying BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEMDAS
For Problem P, since there are no brackets or other operations with higher precedence, we perform operations from left to right. So, the first calculation should be \( 4-5 \).
For Problem Q, according to BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEMDAS, multiplication should be done before addition, so \( 5 \times 6 \) should be calculated first.

## 3: Identifying the Correct Answer
The correct approach is:
- For Problem P: \( 4-5 \) should be done first.
- For Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) should be done first.
This matches option B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations. They might think that in Problem P, \( 5+6 \) should be done first because it's addition, or simply not know what to do, leading to a higher chance of incorrect answers. For Problem Q, they might add first. So, A and C could be popular due to misconceptions.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still make mistakes. They are more likely to recognize the need for \( 4-5 \) in Problem P but could be unsure about Problem Q, potentially leaning towards B as they start to grasp the concept of doing multiplication before addition.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations well. They will know to do \( 4-5 \) first in Problem P and \( 5 \times 6 \) first in Problem Q, making B the correct and likely choice.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, including the order of operations. They will easily identify B as the correct answer.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple left-to-right without considering operations), B=20% (some understanding but easily misled), C=30% (misconception about operations), D=20% (might understand one part but not the other).
- **Basic**: A=10% (starting to understand but might still make basic errors), B=60% (starting to get the hang of it), C=20% (still confused), D=10% (clear understanding but less common at this level).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (strong understanding), B=90% (clearly understand order of operations), C=3% (very few still confused), D=2% (rarely mistaken).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (solid understanding), B=95% (confident in their knowledge), C=2% (unlikely to be mistaken), D=3% (extremely rare errors).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2% D=3%
