To approach this question, let's first analyze the algebraic process involved in solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) and then evaluate the statements made by Tom and Katie.

## Step 1: Solve the Equation to Understand the Correct Process
To solve \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\), the first step is to isolate the term involving \(x\). This can be done by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:
\(\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5\)
which simplifies to:
\(\frac{x}{3} = 17\).

## 2: Evaluate Tom's Statement
Tom says a correct next line of working could be: \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). From Step 1, we see that this is indeed a correct step in solving the equation. Therefore, Tom is correct.

## 3: Evaluate Katie's Statement
Katie says a correct next line of working could be: \(x - 5 = 36\). To assess this, let's see what operation would lead to this equation. If we multiply every term in the original equation by 3 to clear the fraction:
\(x - 15 = 36\).
However, Katie's statement implies:
\(x - 5 = 36\).
Let's solve Katie's equation for \(x\):
\(x = 36 + 5 = 41\).
Substituting \(x = 41\) back into the original equation to check:
\(\frac{41}{3} - 5 = \frac{41}{3} - \frac{15}{3} = \frac{26}{3} \neq 12\).
So, Katie's suggestion does not correctly solve the original equation.

## 4: Assess the Likelihood of Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and may not fully understand the equation solving process. They might incorrectly validate both or neither option due to a lack of understanding. However, given the straightforward nature of Tom's suggestion, more might recognize Tom's correctness. 
  - A=60% (recognize Tom's correct step), B=10% (mistakenly think Katie's step is correct without proper calculation), C=5% (unlikely to see both as correct given the error in Katie's), D=25% (not understanding either).

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding of algebra. They are more likely to correctly assess Tom's statement but might be tricked by Katie's if they don't fully work through the implications.
  - A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.

- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebraic manipulations and should easily identify Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrectness.
  - A=90%, B=2%, C=2%, D=6%.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding of algebra and the structure of equations. They will clearly see Tom's statement as correct and Katie's as incorrect.
  - A=95%, B=1%, C=1%, D=3%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
basic: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=2% C=2% D=6%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%
