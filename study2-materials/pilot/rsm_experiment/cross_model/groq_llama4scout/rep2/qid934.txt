## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it aims to test
The question provides a table of values for the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) and asks students to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\). The equation can be rearranged to solve for \(y\): \(2y = 10 - 4x\), which simplifies to \(y = 5 - 2x\). This is a straightforward substitution task.

## 2: Identify the correct solution
To find \(y\) when \(x = 0\), substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(y = 5 - 2x\). This yields \(y = 5 - 2(0) = 5\).

## 3: Consider common misconceptions or errors
A common error might involve misinterpreting the equation or incorrectly substituting \(x = 0\). However, given the simplicity of the task and the equation, most errors would likely arise from algebraic mistakes rather than a deep-seated misconception about the form of the equation.

## 4: Analyze the options provided
The options are \(A = 20\), \(B = 3\), \(C = 5\), and \(D = 2.5\). The correct answer, as calculated, is \(C = 5\).

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations or substituting into an equation. They might incorrectly solve the equation or not understand how to use it. Given the simplicity of the question, some might guess or make calculation errors. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(D = 30\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple errors. They are likely to attempt solving the equation but might get confused. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 70\%\), \(D = 15\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebraic equations well and can solve them accurately. They are less likely to make errors on simple substitution tasks. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 2\%\), \(C = 95\%\), \(D = 3\%\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and can handle complex equations. They are highly unlikely to make mistakes on simple tasks like this. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 0\%\), \(C = 100\%\), \(D = 0\%\).

## 6: Finalize predictions
Based on the analysis, the predictions are:
- below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- basic: A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%
- proficient: A=0% B=2% C=95% D=3%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%
proficient: A=0% B=2% C=95% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
