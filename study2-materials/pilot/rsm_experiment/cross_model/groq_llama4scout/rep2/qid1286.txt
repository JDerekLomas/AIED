## Step 1: Understand the question and the formula for the volume of a sphere
The volume \(V\) of a sphere is given by the formula \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere. The task is to solve for \(r\) given \(V\).

## 2: Solve the volume formula for \(r\)
Rearrange the formula to solve for \(r\):
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\]
\[V \cdot \frac{3}{4\pi} = r^3\]
\[r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\]

## 3: Compare the solved formula with the given options
The correct formula for \(r\) is \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\). Let's compare this with the options:
- A: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V\pi}{3}}\)
- B: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}\)
- C: \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\)
- D: \(\frac{3\sqrt[3]{V}}{4\pi}\)

## 4: Analyze each option against the correct formula
- Option A is incorrect because it incorrectly places \(\pi\) and the constants.
- Option B is incorrect for similar reasons, swapping the position of \(\pi\) and the constants.
- Option C matches the correct formula derived.
- Option D is incorrect as it does not correctly represent the solution to the equation.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulation and formula rearrangement. They might choose options that seem simpler or more familiar, possibly leading to a higher chance of selecting incorrect options like A, B, or D.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make careless mistakes or not fully understand the algebraic steps. They might be more likely to choose A or B due to misunderstanding the formula.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts and can apply them. They are likely to choose C as they can correctly rearrange the formula.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also manipulate formulas with ease. They would likely choose C without hesitation.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each ability level
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (looks like a plausible formula), B=20% (similar to A, but less likely), C=20% (correct but might not derive it), D=30% (looks complicated but could be guessed).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=15%, C=60% (most can derive or recognize the correct formula), D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
