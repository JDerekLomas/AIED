To approach this question, let's consider what it tests: the order of operations in mathematics, specifically the recall of BIDMAS/BODMAS (Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction) rules.

## Step 1: Understand the Problems
Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \), and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). According to BIDMAS/BODMAS, in Problem P, since there are no brackets, indices, division, or multiplication, we perform the operations from left to right, which means \( 4-5 \) should be done first. In Problem Q, multiplication should be done before addition, so \( 5 \times 6 \) should be done first.

## 2: Analyze the Options
- A: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - Incorrect for Q because it doesn't follow BIDMAS/BODMAS.
- B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Correct for both; follows BIDMAS/BODMAS.
- C: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \) - Incorrect for both; doesn't follow BIDMAS/BODMAS.
- D: Problem P: \( 5+6 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \) - Incorrect for P because it incorrectly suggests doing addition before subtraction when there are no brackets or higher-precedence operations.

## 3: Consider Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the order of operations. They might not recall BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly or might not apply it properly.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make careless mistakes or not fully apply rules in all contexts.
- **Proficient**: These students have a good grasp of mathematical concepts, including the order of operations, and are less likely to make mistakes.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can apply the concepts accurately and efficiently.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- For **Below Basic** students, there's a higher chance of incorrect answers due to a lack of understanding of BIDMAS/BODMAS. Option B seems correct but let's assume a significant portion might not understand: A=30% (misunderstanding order of operations), B=40% (some get it right), C=15% (random incorrect choice), D=15% (another incorrect choice).
- For **Basic** students, understanding improves: A=15%, B=70%, C=10%, D=5%.
- For **Proficient** students, most should get it right: A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- For **Advanced** students, nearly all should answer correctly: A=2%, B=95%, C=2%, D=1%.

## 5: Assign Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
- **basic**: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
- **advanced**: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
