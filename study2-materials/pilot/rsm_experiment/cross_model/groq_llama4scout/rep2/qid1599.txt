To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question asks for the correct algebraic convention for the expression \( c \div(h+4) \). The correct expression following algebraic conventions is \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which corresponds to option A.

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic notation and operations. They might confuse the order of operations or misinterpret the division in the context of algebraic expressions. 
  - A: \( \frac{c}{h+4} \) might be challenging for them to recognize as correct due to difficulties with notation.
  - B: \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \) could appeal to those who mistakenly add 4 to \(c\).
  - C: \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \) might be chosen by those who incorrectly apply order of operations or misunderstand division by an expression.
  - D: \( \frac{h+4}{c} \) could be selected by those who reverse the numerator and denominator.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still make simple errors or misunderstand how to apply algebraic rules in expressions.
  - They are more likely to recognize A as correct but might still be tempted by B or C due to common misconceptions.

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of algebraic expressions and are less likely to fall into common traps.
  - They should easily identify A as correct.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand algebraic expressions but also can apply them in complex contexts. 
  - They will certainly choose A.

Considering these points:

- **Below Basic**: A=40% (recognizing the correct format might be difficult), B=30% (adding 4 to c), C=20% (misunderstanding division), D=10% (reversing).
- **Basic**: A=70% (understanding the correct format), B=15% (common mistake), C=10% (less common mistake), D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=90% (strong understanding), B=5%, C=4%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: A=98% (almost certain), B=1%, C=1%, D=0%.

Therefore:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
