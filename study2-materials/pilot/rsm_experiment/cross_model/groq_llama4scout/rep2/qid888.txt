## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). This is a standard algebraic expansion task.

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
A common misconception in expanding expressions like \((m-5)(m-7)\) is incorrectly applying the rules of signs. Students might mistakenly add or subtract terms incorrectly, leading to errors in the expanded form.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(m^{2}-2m-35\)
- Option B: \(m^{2}-12m+35\)
- Option C: \(m^{2}+12m+35\)
- Option D: \(m^{2}-12m-35\)

## 4: Correct Expansion
The correct expansion of \((m-5)(m-7)\) is:
\[m(m-7) - 5(m-7)\]
\[= m^{2} - 7m - 5m + 35\]
\[= m^{2} - 12m + 35\]
So, the correct answer is B.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They could incorrectly expand or mix up operations, potentially leading to a higher chance of selecting incorrect options, especially those that seem plausible but are incorrect, such as A or C.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to understand the concept of expanding brackets but could get the signs or operations wrong, potentially favoring A or D due to oversight in calculations.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of algebra and are less likely to make errors in expansion. They should predominantly choose B, with minimal selection of incorrect options.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident and accurate in their algebraic manipulations. They would almost exclusively choose B, with very few or no incorrect selections.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (common mistake of not adjusting for the -5 and -7 correctly), B=20% (correct but might not reach this option due to errors), C=20% (incorrect addition of terms), D=30% (error in handling negative terms).
- **Basic:** A=15% (simple calculation error), B=70% (correct expansion), C=5% (unlikely but possible mistake), D=10% (another type of calculation error).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (minor error), B=90% (accurate expansion), C=2% (rare mistake), D=3% (another rare error).
- **Advanced:** A=1% (extremely rare error), B=98% (correct), C=0.5% (very rare mistake), D=0.5% (very rare error).

## 7: Formatting the Response
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
- advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%
