To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with it.

The question is: \[
8+12 \div 4 \square(8+12) \div 4
\]

First, let's solve it correctly:
1. Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right):
\[ 8 + 12 \div 4 = 8 + 3 = 11 \]
\[ (8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, \( 11 \square 5 \).

2. Therefore, the correct symbol to use is \( > \) because \( 11 > 5 \).

Now, let's consider the potential misconceptions and how students at different ability levels might respond:

- **Misconception**: Not following the order of operations correctly, which could lead students to incorrectly evaluate the expressions.

## Step 1: Evaluate the question's difficulty and common misconceptions.
The question tests the understanding of the order of operations. A common error is to perform operations from left to right without following the hierarchy, or not recognizing that division comes before addition in the order of operations.

## 2: Consider student performance at each ability level.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand or consistently apply the order of operations. They might calculate \( 8 + 12 \div 4 \) as \( (8 + 12) \div 4 \) or vice versa, leading to incorrect comparisons.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make careless mistakes or not fully apply the rules consistently, especially under time pressure.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to have a good grasp of the order of operations and should mostly answer correctly, but a few might still slip up due to oversight.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong and confident understanding of mathematical operations, including the order of operations.

## 3: Predict student responses.
Given the question and common misconceptions:
- If students mistakenly calculate \( 8 + 12 \div 4 \) as \( 20 \div 4 = 5 \) or \( (8+12) \div 4 \) as \( 8 + 3 = 11 \), they might choose incorrectly.

## 4: Estimate percentages for each ability level.
- **Below Basic**: Might largely choose \( C = \) or \( = \) (thinking they are equal or not sure), with some choosing \( < \) or \( > \) based on incorrect calculations. \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 40\% \), \( D = 10\% \).
- **Basic**: Should start to show an understanding, but errors still occur. \( A = 40\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 30\% \), \( D = 10\% \).
- **Proficient**: Mostly correct, with \( > \) being the right answer. \( A = 70\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 15\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
- **Advanced**: Very high accuracy. \( A = 90\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 3\% \), \( D = 2\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
