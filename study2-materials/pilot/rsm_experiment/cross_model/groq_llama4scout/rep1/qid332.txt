To approach this question, let's first analyze the equation and the proposed next lines of working by Tom and Katie, then consider the common misconceptions and how they might affect students at different ability levels.

The given equation is:
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12
\]

Tom suggests:
\[
\frac{x}{3} = 17
\]
Which is correct because adding 5 to both sides of the equation yields:
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5
\]
\[
\frac{x}{3} = 17
\]

Katie suggests:
\[
x - 5 = 36
\]
This can be evaluated by first multiplying every term in the original equation by 3 to clear the denominator:
\[
x - 15 = 36
\]
Adding 15 to both sides gives:
\[
x = 51
\]
However, Katie's suggestion does not directly follow from the original equation in a straightforward manner without additional steps that alter the equation's form. To see if Katie's line could be considered correct, let's properly derive it:
If we multiply the entire original equation by 3:
\[
x - 15 = 36
\]
Then add 5 to both sides (or equivalently, add 15 and then subtract 10, but directly adding 5):
\[
x = 36 + 15
\]
\[
x = 51
\]
But Katie's line \(x - 5 = 36\) implies:
\[
x = 41
\]
Which does not match the solution to the original equation. The confusion might arise from incorrect manipulation.

## Step 1: Understanding the task
We need to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) regarding who is correct between Tom and Katie.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's suggestion
Tom's suggestion, \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), directly and correctly follows from adding 5 to both sides of the given equation. This is a straightforward and correct algebraic manipulation.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's suggestion
Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), seems to misunderstand the algebraic manipulation. If we multiply the whole equation by 3, we get \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\). This indicates a likely misconception or error in algebraic manipulation.

## 4: Considering student responses
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly validate Katie's step due to a lack of understanding of how to isolate \(x\) properly or might see Tom's as correct but not understand why Katie's is incorrect. 
  - A=60% (recognize Tom's correctness)
  - B=20% (mistakenly think Katie is correct)
  - C=10% (think both are correct, due to confusion)
  - D=10% (think neither is correct, due to not understanding either)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding of algebra but might still make simple mistakes. They are more likely to recognize Tom's correctness but might be confused by Katie's suggestion.
  - A=80% 
  - B=10% 
  - C=5% 
  - D=5%

- **Proficient**: These students understand algebraic manipulations well and can see the correctness of Tom's suggestion and the incorrectness of Katie's.
  - A=90% 
  - B=5% 
  - C=0% 
  - D=5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident in their algebraic manipulations and can quickly identify correct and incorrect steps.
  - A=95% 
  - B=0% 
  - C=0% 
  - D=5%

The best answer is below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
