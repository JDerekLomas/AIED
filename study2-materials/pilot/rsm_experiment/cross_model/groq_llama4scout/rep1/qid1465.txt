To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or challenges students might face.

The question is: \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Order of Operations
The expression requires the application of the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). In this case, students need to perform the multiplication before addition and subtraction.

## 2: Calculating the Correct Answer
Following BIDMAS:
1. Multiply 4 by 2: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Then, subtract 5 from 3: \(3 - 5 = -2\)
3. Finally, add 8 to -2: \(-2 + 8 = 6\)

So, the correct answer is \(6\), which corresponds to option A.

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception is performing operations in the wrong order or not following BIDMAS correctly. For example, some students might calculate the expression from left to right: \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 = 2\), and finally \(2 \times 2 = 4\), but this would be incorrect as it misinterprets the order of operations and doesn't correctly handle the multiplication.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand or remember the order of operations. They might perform the operations from left to right or make simple arithmetic mistakes. 
  - Option A (correct): \(10\%\)
  - Option B: Could result from incorrect calculation or misunderstanding, \(20\%\)
  - Option C: Seems too low and might result from a significant miscalculation, \(30\%\)
  - Option D: Another possible incorrect calculation, \(40\%\)

- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still struggle with applying BIDMAS consistently.
  - Option A (correct): \(40\%\)
  - Option B: \(30\%\) (simple mistake or incorrect order)
  - Option C: \(15\%\) (larger mistake)
  - Option D: \(15\%\) (another calculation error)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations but might make occasional errors under pressure.
  - Option A (correct): \(80\%\)
  - Option B: \(10\%\) (occasional mistake)
  - Option C: \(5\%\)
  - Option D: \(5\%\)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident in their mathematical abilities and are less likely to make basic errors.
  - Option A (correct): \(95\%\)
  - Option B: \(3\%\)
  - Option C: \(1\%\)
  - Option D: \(1\%\)

## 5: Providing the Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
- **basic**: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
