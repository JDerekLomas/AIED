## Step 1: Understand the question and the equation given
The equation provided is \(4x + 2y = 10\), and we need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\). This is a straightforward substitution into the equation.

## 2: Solve for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\):
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]
\[y = 5\]

## 3: Analyze the options and potential student responses
Given the solution \(y = 5\), let's look at the options:
- A: \(20\)
- B: \(3\)
- C: \(5\)
- D: \(2.5\)

## 4: Consider common misconceptions or errors
A common misconception might involve incorrect substitution or algebraic manipulation. However, this question is quite straightforward, requiring only basic algebraic skills.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra or substitution. They might incorrectly substitute or not solve for \(y\) correctly. Given the simplicity of the question, some might guess or apply incorrect operations.
- **Basic:** Students here should be able to handle simple algebra. They might make careless mistakes but should generally understand how to substitute and solve for one variable.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily solve the equation with correct substitution and algebraic manipulation.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should not only solve it correctly but might also see the question as trivial and answer quickly.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level
- **Below Basic:** 
  - A = 20% (random guess)
  - B = 15% (another guess)
  - C = 40% (correct, but could be due to luck or a simple guess)
  - D = 25% (guess or simple miscalculation)

- **Basic:**
  - A = 5% (careless mistake or guess)
  - B = 5% (mistake)
  - C = 80% (correct substitution and calculation)
  - D = 10% (simple calculation error)

- **Proficient:**
  - A = 0% (unlikely mistake)
  - B = 0% (unlikely mistake)
  - C = 95% (correct calculation)
  - D = 5% (minor calculation error)

- **Advanced:**
  - A = 0% (no chance of mistake)
  - B = 0% (no chance of mistake)
  - C = 100% (correct calculation, no room for error)
  - D = 0% (no chance of minor error)

## 7: Refine estimates based on question specifics
Given the question's straightforward nature, even students below the basic level might stumble upon the correct answer through guesswork or simple trials. Proficient and advanced students will likely get it right.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
