## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). This is a test of algebraic skills, specifically the ability to apply the distributive property (also known as FOIL when dealing with binomials) to expand the product of two binomials.

## 2: Applying FOIL Method
To solve this, we apply the FOIL method, which stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. This means we multiply the first terms in each bracket, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, and finally the last terms in each bracket, and then add them all together:
\((m \cdot m) + (m \cdot -7) + (-5 \cdot m) + (-5 \cdot -7)\)
\(= m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\)
\(= m^2 - 12m + 35\)

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve incorrect application of signs or incorrect multiplication. For instance, some students might forget to distribute the negative sign properly or might add the terms incorrectly.

## 4: Evaluating the Options
- Option A: \(m^2 - 2m - 35\). This would be incorrect because it suggests the \(m\) terms were combined as \(-2m\) instead of \(-12m\).
- Option B: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\). This matches our correct calculation.
- Option C: \(m^2 + 12m + 35\). This would be incorrect because it suggests both \(m\) terms were positive, which is not the case.
- Option D: \(m^2 - 12m - 35\). This is incorrect because it incorrectly suggests a negative constant term.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students might struggle significantly with algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly apply FOIL or make simple arithmetic mistakes. Given the nature of the question, a high likelihood of choosing incorrect options, especially A and D, due to confusion with signs and term combinations. \(A=30\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=30\%\)
- **Basic**: Students at this level have some understanding but may still make errors in applying the FOIL method or in simple arithmetic. They might be more likely to choose A due to a miscalculation of the middle terms. \(A=40\%\), \(B=40\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=10\%\)
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to have a solid grasp of algebraic expansion. Mistakes are less likely, but some might still occur due to carelessness. \(A=10\%\), \(B=80\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=5\%\)
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident and accurate in their algebraic manipulations. It's unlikely they would choose incorrect options. \(A=0\%\), \(B=95\%\), \(C=2.5\%\), \(D=2.5\%\)

## 6: Conclusion
Given the analysis, the predictions can be summarized as follows:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=40% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2.5% D=2.5%
