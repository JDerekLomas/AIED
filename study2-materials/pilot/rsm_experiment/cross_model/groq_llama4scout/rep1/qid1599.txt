To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's first analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question asks for the correct algebraic convention for the expression \( c \div(h+4) \). The correct representation of this expression is \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which corresponds to option A.

- **Misconceptions and common errors:**
  - A common misconception might be to confuse the order of operations or to misunderstand how division by a sum is represented algebraically.
  - Another error could be adding \( c \) and \( 4 \) in the numerator or incorrectly distributing.
  - Students might also mistakenly think that \( c \div(h+4) \) means \( c \) divided by \( h \) plus \( 4 \), or they might swap the positions of \( c \) and \( (h+4) \) in the fraction.

Given these potential misconceptions and the algebraic conventions typically taught:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students are likely to struggle significantly with algebraic expressions and conventions. They might not fully grasp the concept of division by a sum or the proper way to write such expressions algebraically.
  - A: \( 30\% \) (some might recognize the correct form by chance or have seen it before)
  - B: \( 20\% \) (adding \( 4 \) to \( c \) is a common operational mistake)
  - C: \( 25\% \) (dividing \( c \) by \( h \) and then adding \( 4 \) reflects a misunderstanding of algebraic operations)
  - D: \( 25\% \) (swapping numerator and denominator is a frequent error)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still struggle with applying algebraic conventions correctly, especially in more abstract contexts.
  - A: \( 60\% \) (more are likely to recognize the correct algebraic form)
  - B: \( 20\% \) (still a plausible but incorrect option due to misunderstandings)
  - C: \( 10\% \) (less likely to distribute incorrectly in this context)
  - D: \( 10\% \) (swapping is less common among those with some algebraic understanding)

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of algebraic expressions and are more likely to apply conventions accurately.
  - A: \( 90\% \) (strong understanding of algebraic division and brackets)
  - B: \( 5\% \) (less likely to make the addition mistake)
  - C: \( 3\% \) (unlikely to misinterpret the operations significantly)
  - D: \( 2\% \) (rarely would they confuse the positions)

- **Advanced:** At this level, students not only understand algebraic conventions but can also manipulate and apply them with ease.
  - A: \( 98\% \) (high confidence in algebraic representation)
  - B: \( 1\% \) (unlikely to fall for basic errors)
  - C: \( 0.5\% \) (rarely make operational mistakes)
  - D: \( 0.5\% \) (extremely unlikely to confuse the fraction)

**Therefore:**

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
