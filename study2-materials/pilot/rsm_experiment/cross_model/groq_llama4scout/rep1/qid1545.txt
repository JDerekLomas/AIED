## Step 1: Understand the question and the mathematical operations involved
The question involves a comparison between two expressions: \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\). To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction).

## 2: Solve the expressions according to the order of operations
For the first expression, \(8+12 \div 4\), we follow BIDMAS:
1. Division first: \(12 \div 4 = 3\)
2. Then addition: \(8 + 3 = 11\)

For the second expression, \((8+12) \div 4\):
1. Evaluate inside the brackets: \(8 + 12 = 20\)
2. Then division: \(20 \div 4 = 5\)

## 3: Compare the results of the two expressions
Comparing the two results: \(11\) for the first expression and \(5\) for the second expression, it's clear that \(11 > 5\).

## 4: Analyze the potential for misconceptions
A common misconception is to ignore the order of operations or to misunderstand how operations are grouped within expressions. However, this question is structured to test the understanding of BIDMAS directly and the effect of brackets on the order of operations.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand or apply the BIDMAS rule correctly. They might calculate the expressions from left to right or misunderstand the bracket's impact, potentially leading to incorrect comparisons. However, given the simplicity of the numbers and the clear difference in results, a significant portion might still guess or calculate incorrectly but could be swayed towards the obviously larger result without correct calculation.

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in applying BIDMAS consistently or might not fully grasp the impact of brackets. They are more likely to calculate correctly but could be tempted by misconceptions.

- **Proficient**: These students are expected to apply BIDMAS correctly and understand the grouping effect of brackets. They should accurately calculate both expressions and compare them correctly.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only apply BIDMAS correctly but also have a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. They would easily solve and compare the expressions.

## 6: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the straightforward nature of the calculations once BIDMAS is applied, and assuming most students are familiar with the rule:
- The correct answer is \(>\) (A), as \(11 > 5\).
- **Below Basic**: A=60% (many will see 8+12=20 and 20/4=5, or just guess), B=20% (some might think the expressions are equal or less), C=10% (thinking it's equal), D=10% (greater than or equal to).
- **Basic**: A=80% (most will calculate or reason correctly), B=10% (some incorrect reasoning), C=5% (equal), D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=95% (accurate application of BIDMAS), B=3% (rare mistake), C=1% (equal), D=1%.
- **Advanced**: A=99% (virtually all apply BIDMAS correctly), B=1% (unlikely but possible minor error), C=0%, D=0%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
