## Step 1: Understand the equation and the task
The given equation is \(10x - 6y = 30\), and we need to find the value of \(x\) when \(y = 0.5\).

## 2: Substitute \(y = 0.5\) into the equation
Substituting \(y = 0.5\) into the equation gives \(10x - 6(0.5) = 30\).

## 3: Solve for \(x\)
Solving for \(x\), we get \(10x - 3 = 30\), which simplifies to \(10x = 33\), and thus \(x = 3.3\).

## 4: Evaluate the question's difficulty and potential misconceptions
This question requires substituting a given value into an equation and solving for the other variable. It's a straightforward substitution and solving task. The potential for error could come from miscalculation or incorrect substitution.

## 5: Consider student ability levels and their likely performance
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulation and substitution. They might make calculation errors or not fully understand how to solve for \(x\). Given the simplicity of the calculation (\(10x = 33\)), even students below the basic level might get this right if they can manage the arithmetic, but errors in calculation or substitution are likely.

## 6: Predict performance for each option across ability levels
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (correct calculation but might not know how to get there), B=20% (error in calculation or concept), C=40% (correct answer, might get lucky or understand substitution), D=20% (alternative incorrect calculation).
- **Basic**: A=10% (unlikely to make a significant error), B=10% (error), C=70% (correct calculation), D=10% (minor calculation mistake).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (very unlikely error), B=5% (rare error), C=85% (accurately solves), D=5% (simple miscalculation).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (extremely unlikely to make an error), B=0% (no chance of this error), C=95% (easily and accurately solves), D=5% (might be a rare typo or minor oversight).

## 7: Correct the prediction format
Given the calculations and understanding:
- The correct answer is \(C = 3.3\).
- **Below Basic**: A=10%, B=15%, C=60%, D=15%
- **Basic**: A=5%, B=5%, C=80%, D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=2%, B=2%, C=90%, D=6%
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
