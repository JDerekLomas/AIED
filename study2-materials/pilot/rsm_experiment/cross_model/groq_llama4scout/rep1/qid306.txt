To approach this question, let's analyze the problems and the common misconceptions or areas of difficulty students might have, particularly focusing on the order of operations.

## Step 1: Understanding the Problems
Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \) and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). The task is to determine which calculation should be done first in each problem.

## 2: Order of Operations
The standard order of operations is often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction). For Problem P, there are no brackets, indices, division, or multiplication, so we proceed from left to right: \( 4-5 \) should be done first. For Problem Q, following BIDMAS, \( 5 \times 6 \) should be done before \( 4+ \) (the result of \( 5 \times 6 \)).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A suggests for Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and for Problem Q: \( 4+5 \), which is incorrect for Problem Q because it doesn't follow BIDMAS.
- Option B suggests for Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and for Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \), which aligns with the correct order of operations for both problems.
- Option C suggests for Problem P: \( 5+6 \) and for Problem Q: \( 4+5 \), which is incorrect for both problems according to BIDMAS.
- Option D suggests for Problem P: \( 5+6 \) and for Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \), which is incorrect for Problem P.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations. They might think that in Problem P, \( 5+6 \) should be done first because it's addition, and in Problem Q, \( 4+5 \) because it's straightforward. So, \( C \) might be a common choice.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still make mistakes. They should know to do \( 4-5 \) first in Problem P but might confuse the operations in Problem Q. Option A could be tempting because it correctly identifies \( 4-5 \) for Problem P but incorrectly \( 4+5 \) for Problem Q.
- **Proficient**: These students understand BIDMAS. They will correctly choose \( B \) because they know \( 4-5 \) comes first in Problem P and \( 5 \times 6 \) comes first in Problem Q.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and will also choose \( B \) correctly, with a high degree of confidence.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some understand simple subtraction), B=10% (might see the correct sequence but not understand why), C=60% (incorrect but follows a simple addition/subtraction pattern), D=10% (unlikely).
- **Basic**: A=40% (common mistake), B=30% (understand both), C=20% (mistake), D=10% (unlikely).
- **Proficient**: A=10% (some residual confusion), B=80% (correct understanding), C=5% (rare mistake), D=5% (rare mistake).
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.

The best answer is B.
