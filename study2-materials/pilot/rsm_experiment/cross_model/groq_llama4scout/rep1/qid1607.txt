To solve this, let's analyze Isaac's steps and the question asked, determining the correctness of each step and then predicting student responses based on common misconceptions and understanding of algebra.

## Step 1: Analyze Isaac's Steps
Isaac starts with the equation \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\). To find \(k\), a common first step would be to multiply both sides by 4 to isolate \(1+k\), which yields \(60 = 1 + k\). This confirms that Step 1 is correct.

## 2: Evaluate Step 2
From Step 1, we have \(60 = 1 + k\). Subtracting 1 from both sides gives \(59 = k\), not \(61 = k\) as Isaac states in Step 2. Therefore, Step 2 is incorrect.

## 3: Determine Correctness of Options
- Since Step 1 is correct and Step 2 is incorrect, the correct answer is A: Only step 1.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly validate both steps or incorrectly dismiss them. However, given the straightforward nature of the error in Step 2, a significant portion might recognize the mistake but could be confused about which step is right. \(A=40\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=30\%\).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a grasp of basic algebra but might make simple calculation errors. They are likely to spot the error in Step 2 but may be unsure. \(A=60\%\), \(B=15\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=20\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebra and should easily identify the correctness of Step 1 and the incorrectness of Step 2. \(A=80\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=0\%\), \(D=15\%\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding of algebra and the equation. They will quickly validate Step 1 and refute Step 2. \(A=90\%\), \(B=0\%\), \(C=0\%\), \(D=10\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
