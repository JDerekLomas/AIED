To solve this, let's first find a common denominator for the fractions and then add them together.

## Step 1: Finding a Common Denominator
The fractions given are \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}\). The common denominator for these fractions is \(2x\), since \(x\) can be multiplied by \(2\) to get \(2x\).

## 2: Converting Fractions to Have a Common Denominator
Convert \(\frac{4}{x}\) to have a denominator of \(2x\): \(\frac{4}{x} \times \frac{2}{2} = \frac{8}{2x}\).

## 3: Adding the Fractions
Now, add \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}\).

## 4: Simplifying the Fraction (if necessary)
The fraction \(\frac{11}{2x}\) cannot be simplified further because \(11\) is a prime number and does not share any common factors with \(2x\).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
Given the solution is \(\frac{11}{2x}\), let's consider how students at different levels might respond:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with finding a common denominator or adding fractions. They might not even attempt to find a common denominator or might incorrectly add the numerators and denominators separately. Option A (\(\frac{11}{2x}\)) is the correct answer, but students might choose B (\(\frac{7}{3x}\)), C (\(\frac{11}{x}\)), or D (\(\frac{7}{2x}\)) due to errors in calculation or concept. Given the simplicity of the numbers, a significant portion might still stumble upon the correct answer or a logically incorrect but simple option.

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic fraction operations. They are likely to understand the need for a common denominator but might make calculation errors. The correct answer, A (\(\frac{11}{2x}\)), should be within their reach, but some might opt for C (\(\frac{11}{x}\)) if they forget to adjust the numerator of the second fraction properly.

- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebraic manipulations and fraction operations. They should easily identify the correct answer as A (\(\frac{11}{2x}\)) and avoid the distractors, which are based on common misconceptions.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding of algebraic concepts and can apply them accurately. They will certainly choose A (\(\frac{11}{2x}\)) and not be swayed by the incorrect options.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some manage to get it right by chance or simple calculation), B=20% (error in calculation), C=30% (common denominator not used or incorrect), D=10% (alternative incorrect calculation).
- **Basic**: A=60% (understand the concept but might make minor errors), B=15% (incorrect calculation), C=20% (forget to adjust one fraction), D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=90% (strong understanding of algebraic fractions), B=5% (minor error), C=4% (error in adjusting fractions), D=1%.
- **Advanced**: A=98% (very confident in algebraic manipulations), B=1% (rare error), C=0.5% (extremely rare mistake), D=0.5%.

The best answer is A. 

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
