To solve this question, students need to recall the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is \( V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \), where \( V \) is the volume and \( r \) is the radius. Rearranging this formula to solve for \( r \) yields \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}} \).

Given this, let's consider the options and how students at different ability levels might perform:

- **below_basic**: These students might struggle significantly with algebraic manipulations and formulae. They are likely to select incorrect options without a clear reasoning process because they may not understand how to rearrange the volume formula to solve for \( r \) or might confuse the formula itself.
  - A) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \) seems incorrect as it places \( \pi \) in the numerator and might not align with the correct formula rearrangement for some students.
  - B) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \) incorrectly inverts the roles of \( 4 \) and \( \pi \) from the formula.
  - C) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \) is the correct formula but may not be chosen due to confusion.
  - D) \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \) rearranges part of the formula but not the entire thing correctly in relation to extracting \( r \).

  Prediction: 
  - A: A significant portion due to confusion about where \( \pi \) and \( 4 \) go.
  - B: Some might think they're correct because of misunderstanding the rearrangement.
  - C: Fewer because it's correct but they may not have the formula correct in their heads.
  - D: A sizeable amount because it partially resembles the original volume formula.

  below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%

- **basic**: These students can handle the formula but might make simple mistakes or not fully understand the rearrangement.
  - They can identify C) as correct after some thought because it resembles the inverse operation needed to isolate \( r \).
  - Other options would be less appealing as they clearly do not follow the inverse operation correctly.

  Prediction:
  - A: Some confusion might still be present.
  - B: Similar to A, with fewer choosing due to clearer mistakes.
  - C: Recognized as the correct formula rearrangement.
  - D: Incorrect due to not properly inverting all parts of the formula.

  basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%

- **proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of algebraic manipulations and formulae.
  - They understand how to accurately rearrange the formula for the volume of a sphere to solve for \( r \), which leads them directly to C) as the correct choice without much confusion.
  - Options A and B represent clear mistakes in rearranging the formula.
  - D shows misunderstanding in how the cube root applies to the entire fraction, not just \( V \).

  Prediction:
  - A and B: Almost none, as these represent basic errors in formula manipulation.
  - C: Nearly all, as it correctly represents the solution for \( r \).
  - D: Hardly any due to misunderstanding the full rearrangement.

  proficient: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%

- **advanced**: At this level, students have not only mastery over the formula and its rearrangement but also an intuitive sense of mathematical principles and checks.
  - They quickly identify C) as correct through a straightforward application of algebra.
  - Any confusion with A, B, or D would be minimal, given their in-depth understanding.

  Prediction:
  - A, B, D: Virtually none, as these reflect fundamental misunderstandings that advanced students would not have.
  - C: Nearly unanimous, given the clear mathematical path to the solution.

  advanced: A=0% B=0% C=99% D=1%
