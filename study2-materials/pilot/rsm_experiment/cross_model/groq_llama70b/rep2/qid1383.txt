below_basic: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
basic: A=90% B=2% C=5% D=3%
proficient: A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%

Reasoning: This question is relatively straightforward, as it only requires students to substitute a value into an equation and evaluate the result. The equation \( T=k^{4} \) is simple, and the calculation \( (-3)^{4} = 81 \) is a basic application of exponent rules. Most students, even those at the below basic level, would recognize that raising a number to an even power results in a positive value, making option A the correct choice. The vast majority of students across all ability levels would select option A, with fewer than 10% choosing incorrect options due to careless mistakes rather than a deep-seated misconception.
