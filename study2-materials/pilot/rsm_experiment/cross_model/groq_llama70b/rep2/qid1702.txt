To determine the correct answer, we need to solve the equation for \(x\) when \(y = 0.5\).

Given: \(10x - 6y = 30\)

Substitute \(y = 0.5\): \(10x - 6(0.5) = 30\)

Simplify: \(10x - 3 = 30\)

Add 3 to both sides: \(10x = 33\)

Divide both sides by 10: \(x = 3.3\)

Therefore, the correct answer is C) \(3.3\).

Given the nature of the question, which requires straightforward substitution and solving for \(x\), and considering common errors or misconceptions that might affect student answers, here's a prediction of student responses by ability level:

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

This prediction considers that:
- Below basic students might struggle with the algebraic manipulation or substitution, leading to a relatively even distribution among incorrect answers.
- Basic students would start to show understanding of how to solve for \(x\), thus increasing the percentage of correct answers, but might still make calculation errors.
- Proficient students are expected to handle the algebraic steps correctly but might still have a small percentage of errors due to minor mistakes in calculation.
- Advanced students would likely demonstrate a strong understanding of algebraic manipulations and are expected to almost uniformly select the correct answer, with very few, if any, errors.
