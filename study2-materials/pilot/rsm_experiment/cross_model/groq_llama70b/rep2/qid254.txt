below_basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
proficient: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
advanced: A=0% B=98% D=2% 

Note: 
For option B, students will perform the calculation as \( (0+1+3+4+7) \div 5 \) since the operations within the brackets are evaluated first due to BIDMAS/BODMAS. This simplifies to \( 15 \div 5 = 3 \), which is indeed the correct calculation for finding the mean of a dataset. Therefore, the most common choice will be B. 

Also, since the numbers include a zero, the incorrect options which omit or misplace the zero won't be tempting to most, hence a relatively low score for these options across the board. 

This question appears more about understanding the concept of mean as an 'average' and recognizing that in a specific case (where a number is zero) it won't trigger an incorrect calculation in some students like it might with different numbers. This makes D) 'None of them' unlikely even for below basic students as B provides a reasonable option once evaluated. 

However, the specific calculations, even the incorrect ones like options A and C, don't have elements that often trigger mistakes like larger numbers that add significant place values that might lead to confusion about significant figures, or negative numbers which students have shown difficulties with before; it's very unlikely an issue arises with B because addition before division isn't often misconstrued at any level of math competence being tested here. Therefore low predictions of other answer choices are given as options that could trigger errors but won't due to this question's context and structure.
