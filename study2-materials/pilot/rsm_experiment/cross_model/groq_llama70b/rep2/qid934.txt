To solve for \(y\) when \(x = 0\), we substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\), yielding \(2y = 10\), and therefore \(y = 5\). This makes option C the correct answer.

Given the straightforward nature of this question, especially since it involves simple substitution and doesn't necessarily trigger common misconceptions about linear equations without specific numbers that might lead to errors (like fractions, negatives, or large numbers that could complicate mental math), most students who understand the basic concept of solving linear equations should get it right.

However, students at different ability levels might interact with this question differently:

- **Below_basic** students might not understand the concept of substituting values into an equation or may struggle with basic math operations, leading to a variety of incorrect answers.
- **Basic** students should grasp the concept but might make careless errors or slightly struggle with the math, possibly being swayed by answer choices that seem plausible but are mathematically incorrect.
- **Proficient** students would understand the equation and correctly substitute \(x = 0\) to find \(y\), rarely making errors unless it's a very careless mistake.
- **Advanced** students would also have no problem solving the equation for \(y\) when \(x = 0\) and likely view this question as straightforward, with virtually no chance of error in their calculation.

Considering these factors, here is the predicted response distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
