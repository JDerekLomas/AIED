To simplify the given expression, we need to find a common denominator. Since the denominators are \(2x\) and \(x\), the common denominator would be \(2x\). Thus, we convert \(\frac{4}{x}\) into \(\frac{4 \times 2}{x \times 2} = \frac{8}{2x}\). The expression then becomes \(\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3 + 8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}\).

Given this, let's consider the ability levels of students:

- **below_basic** students might struggle with recognizing the need for a common denominator or might incorrectly add the numerators without considering the denominators. They might guess randomly among the options, possibly leaning towards options that look simpler (like B or D).
- **basic** students should understand the concept of finding a common denominator but might still struggle with its application or make careless mistakes. They would likely recognize the correct method but could still slip up in their calculation.
- **proficient** students would understand and correctly apply the concept of finding a common denominator to add the fractions. They are likely to get the question correct.
- **advanced** students, having a solid grasp of mathematical concepts and possibly having seen more complex fraction problems, would also find this straightforward and arrive at the correct answer without difficulty.

Considering these ability levels and how they interact with the question, here's a prediction of the percentage of students at each level who would choose each option:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0.5% C=0.5% D=1%
