To determine the correct answer, we need to substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) to find \(y\). 

When \(x = 0\), the equation becomes:
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[0 + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]
\[y = 5\]

So, when \(x = 0\), \(y = 5\). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 5.

Given this, let's predict the distribution of answers among students at different ability levels:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10% 
basic: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5% 
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5% 
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5% 

The reasoning behind these distributions is as follows:
- Below basic students may struggle significantly with the question, either not understanding how to substitute values into equations or making arithmetic mistakes. A significant portion might guess or misunderstand the question.
- Basic students should largely be able to substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation and solve for \(y\), but some might make simple mistakes or misunderstand the equation.
- Proficient students are likely to get the question correct as they understand the substitution method and are less prone to simple arithmetic errors.
- Advanced students are expected to have a solid grasp of algebraic manipulations and should therefore nearly all choose the correct answer, with very few errors.
