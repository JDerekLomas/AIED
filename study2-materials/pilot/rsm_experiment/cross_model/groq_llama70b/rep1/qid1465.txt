To solve this question correctly, students need to apply the order of operations (often remembered by the acronym BODMAS/BIDMAS: Brackets, Orders/Ordinals, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). According to this rule, multiplication should be performed before addition and subtraction. Thus, the correct calculation is:

\[
3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 = 3 - 5 + 8 = 6
\]

Given this, let's assess the likelihood of students at different ability levels choosing each option:

- **Below Basic**: These students may struggle with the order of operations or make calculation errors. Option A is correct, but they might guess or calculate incorrectly. 
  - A) 20% (some might guess correctly or happen to calculate correctly despite not fully understanding the concept)
  - B) 30% (might seem like a reasonable guess)
  - C) 20% (could result from a confusion in signs or operations)
  - D) 30% (similar to B, could be a guess or miscalculation)

- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic arithmetic operations but might still be shaky with the order of operations. They are more likely to get it right than below-basic students but might still make mistakes.
  - A) 50% (many will apply the order of operations correctly, but some might not)
  - B) 20% (less likely as they begin to understand the order of operations)
  - C) 15% (errors in calculation or misunderstanding signs)
  - D) 15% (similar to C, less likely as they progress in understanding)

- **Proficient**: At this level, students are expected to have a good grasp of mathematical operations, including the order of operations. Most will apply the rules correctly.
  - A) 80% (most will correctly apply the order of operations)
  - B) 10% (minor errors or slips in calculation)
  - C) 5% (rare errors, possibly from carelessness)
  - D) 5% (similar to C, rare mistakes)

- **Advanced**: These students have a solid foundation and are unlikely to make operational errors in straightforward questions like this.
  - A) 95% (nearly all will get this correct due to a strong understanding of the order of operations)
  - B) 3% (very rare slip-ups)
  - C) 1% (extremely rare, possibly from not reading the question carefully)
  - D) 1% (similar to C, extremely rare mistakes)

So, in the exact format requested:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
