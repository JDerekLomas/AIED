To solve the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\), one needs to divide both sides by 3 to isolate \(p\), resulting in \(p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\).

Given this straightforward calculation, the likelihood of students selecting the correct answer, B) \(p = \frac{1}{36}\), should be high across all ability levels, as the operation required is basic algebra and division, which most students are familiar with by the time they reach the stage of solving such equations.

However, the potential for error still exists, particularly among less proficient students who may struggle with fractions or basic algebraic manipulations. Advanced students, in contrast, should rarely, if ever, make errors on such straightforward calculations.

Here's a breakdown of the expected choices by ability level:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=70% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
