To solve this, let's consider the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius. To find \(r\), we rearrange the formula to solve for \(r\): \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}\).

Given this, let's evaluate each option:

A) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V \pi}{3}} \) - Incorrect; it incorrectly places \(\pi\) in the numerator.

B) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{4 V}{3 \pi}} \) - Incorrect; it keeps the 4 in the numerator and incorrectly places \(\pi\) in the denominator, opposite to option A but still incorrect.

C) \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}} \) - Correct; this accurately reflects the rearranged formula to solve for \(r\).

D) \( \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4 \pi} \) - Incorrect; it does not properly apply the cube root to the entire fraction \(\frac{3V}{4\pi}\).

Now, predicting student performance:

- **Below Basic** students may struggle significantly with formula manipulation and may guess randomly or select an option that looks appealing due to familiarity with the components (like \(\pi\) or the cube root). Their answers might be fairly evenly distributed, reflecting a lack of understanding of the volume formula or how to manipulate it.
  
  below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%

- **Basic** students understand some basic concepts but might struggle with the rearrangement of formulas. They might recognize parts of the formula but apply it incorrectly. There's a slight chance they recognize the correct answer or eliminate obviously incorrect ones.
  
  basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%

- **Proficient** students have a stronger grasp of mathematical principles, including formula rearrangement. They can apply the volume formula correctly and reverse-engineer it to find the radius. Most should correctly choose option C.
  
  proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%

- **Advanced** students are highly proficient in mathematical manipulations and have a deep understanding of concepts, including the ability to analyze and correct given formulas. Essentially all of them should select the correct answer.
  
  advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

Please note: These percentages are estimates based on the typical distribution of student abilities and understanding. Actual results may vary depending on the specific students, their preparation, and the teaching methods used.
