To solve this, let's break down the given expression step by step for each part and then compare them:

1. \(8 + 12 \div 4\)
   - First, we divide 12 by 4, which equals 3.
   - Then, we add 8 to the result, giving us \(8 + 3 = 11\).

2. \((8 + 12) \div 4\)
   - First, we add 8 and 12, which equals 20.
   - Then, we divide 20 by 4, which equals 5.

So, comparing the two results:
- \(8 + 12 \div 4 = 11\)
- \((8 + 12) \div 4 = 5\)

Since \(11\) is greater than \(5\), the correct symbol to place in the box is \(>\), which corresponds to option A.

Given this analysis, here's a prediction of how students at different ability levels might perform:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

This prediction assumes that:
- Below basic students might struggle more with following the order of operations correctly and comparing the results, leading to a higher distribution of incorrect answers.
- Basic students will generally follow the order of operations but might make more mistakes in calculation or comparison.
- Proficient students will understand and apply the order of operations correctly but might make minor slips in calculations or comparisons.
- Advanced students will have a solid understanding of the concepts and apply them flawlessly, with minimal to no errors.
