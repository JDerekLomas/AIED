To solve this problem, we need to find the value of \( y \) when \( x = 0 \) for the equation \( 4x + 2y = 10 \). 

When \( x = 0 \), the equation becomes \( 4(0) + 2y = 10 \), which simplifies to \( 2y = 10 \). Solving for \( y \) gives \( y = 10 / 2 = 5 \).

Given this is a straightforward substitution and calculation, the question seems to test basic algebraic manipulation rather than a complex misconception. However, the inclusion of a table and the need to understand that the table represents a specific equation might slightly complicate the task for the least proficient students.

Considering these factors:

below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20% 
basic: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10% 
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6% 
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3% 

Note: The percentages are estimates based on the assumption that higher-ability students are more likely to understand the relationship between the table and the equation and perform the substitution and calculation correctly. Lower-ability students might be more likely to be confused by the format or make simple calculation errors, leading to a higher distribution of incorrect answers among them.
