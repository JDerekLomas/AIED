Hello, I am delighted to help. This question targets one of the most persistent hurdles in GCSE-level algebra: the directed number rules during expansion.

Here is my diagnostic breakdown of the student errors and my predictions for performance across ability levels.

### 1. Analysis of Wrong Answer Options

**Option B: $-4$**
*   **Misconception:** "Believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer."
*   **Reasoning:** The student correctly identifies that they need to multiply $(-1) \times (-4)$. They know $1 \times 4 = 4$. However, they apply an incorrect rule for directed numbers, often defaulting to the idea that "if there is a minus in the question, there must be a minus in the answer."

**Option C: $+5$**
*   **Misconception:** Operation confusion (Addition instead of Multiplication).
*   **Reasoning:** When looking at two brackets, students occasionally forget they are in a "multiplication environment." They see the values $-1$ and $-4$ and believe they must combine them. Because they see two negatives, they perform $1 + 4 = 5$ and assume that "two minuses make a plus." It is a classic case of misapplying the additive rule to a multiplicative step.

**Option D: $-5$**
*   **Misconception:** Operational confusion with additive signs.
*   **Reasoning:** Like Option C, the student adds the values instead of multiplying them. However, they correctly follow the logic that $-1 - 4 = -5$ (or they add the values and "keep the sign"). This is a very common error for students who struggle to switch gears between collecting like terms (addition/subtraction) and expanding (multiplication).

### 2. Attractiveness of Errors

*   **Option B ($-4$): Highly Attractive.** This is the most common error for students in the "Basic" to "Lower Proficient" range. The visual of the negative signs in the brackets feels powerful, and many students have an "emergency rule" in their head that negative signs equate to negative results regardless of the operation.
*   **Option D ($-5$): Moderately Attractive.** This appeals to students who have just learned about "collecting like terms." Their most recent memory of negative numbers involves $(-1) + (-4)$, so they default to addition. This is very common among "Below Basic" students.
*   **Option C ($+5$): Low Attractiveness.** While it happens, it requires two layers of error: adding instead of multiplying, AND misapplying the "two minuses make a plus" rule to an addition sum. Usually, if a student adds, they get $-5$.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

As an experienced teacher, I anticipate that even proficient students can be caught out by a "slip" (Option B) if they are working too quickly.

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Neg x Neg = Neg) | C (Added & Changed Sign) | D (Added) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 35% | 15% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 35% | 5% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 80% | 15% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 2% | 0% | 0% |

**Summary of the Profile:**
The "Below Basic" group is almost guessing between the operations, with a heavy bias toward addition ($D$). The "Basic" group has identified the correct operation (multiplication) but fails on the sign rule ($B$). "Proficient" students mostly succeed, but the "Negative x Negative" rule remains the single most likely cause of a "silly mistake" under exam pressure.
