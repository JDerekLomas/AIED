As a specialist maths teacher, diagnosing these errors is a key part of classroom "flipped learning" or using diagnostic questions effectively. The expansion of $(m-5)(m-7)$ is a classic territory for testing the fluency of directed number operations within algebra.

### 1. Analysis of Misconceptions

**A) $m^2 - 2m - 35$**
*   **Reasoning:** The student understands the FOIL/Grid method generally but fails the addition phase of the linear terms. Instead of calculating $(-5) + (-7) = -12$, they treat the terms as a subtraction of absolute values or a "difference" calculation (e.g., $7 - 5 = 2$, keeping the negative sign of the 7). Furthermore, they often fail the final multiplication, believing that the negative signs just "keep the expression looking negative" $(-5 \times -7 = -35)$.
*   **Attractiveness:** Moderately attractive. It appeals to students who have a weak grasp of "counting in the negatives" (Number Line work).

**C) $m^2 + 12m + 35$**
*   **Reasoning:** This is a "Sign Blindness" error. The student identifies that 5 and 7 make 12 (addition) and 35 (multiplication). They may be following a rote rule of "two negatives make a positive" and applying it indiscriminately to *both* the addition part $(-5 + -7)$ and the multiplication part $(-5 \times -7)$.
*   **Attractiveness:** High for mid-ability students. There is a common stage in learning where students over-correct for negative signs, deciding that if there are two negatives in the bracket, the result should just be "all positive."

**D) $m^2 - 12m - 35$**
*   **Reasoning (Given):** "Believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer." The student correctly calculates $-5m - 7m = -12m$ but fails the final product.
*   **Attractiveness:** Extremely high. This is the most "logical" error for a student who is proficient in collecting like terms but hasn't fully internalised the rules for multiplying directed numbers. It feels "right" because the problem is dominated by subtraction signs, so the student feels the final term should also be negative.

### 2. Judging Attractiveness

*   **Option D (The known error):** This is the "Gold Standard" of distractors for this topic. It is highly attractive because it requires no "extra" steps. A student who thinks $(-5) \times (-7) = -35$ is doing work that *looks* right on the page. They won't notice they are wrong until they check a back-to-front proof. Most common at **Basic/Lower-Proficient** levels.
*   **Option C:** This is attractive to students who have just learned "double negative becomes plus" and apply it like a blanket rule to the entire expansion. It is a very common "over-generalisation" error.
*   **Option A:** Usually only attractive to those with poor arithmetic. If a student is comfortable with $(m \pm a)(m \pm b)$, they rarely make this error unless they are rushing.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

The "Advanced" group should find this trivial, but even there, "slips" usually favor Option D due to the visual pattern of negatives.

| Ability Level | A (%) | B (Correct) | C (%) | D (%) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 25% | 15% | 30% | 30% |
| **Basic** | 15% | 30% | 20% | 35% |
| **Proficient** | 5% | 65% | 10% | 20% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 93% | 0% | 5% |

**Key takeaway:** Option D is the primary trap. Even a student who knows the expansion rules can default to a negative result for the final term because "a negative times a negative equals a positive" is an abstract rule that often loses out to the "visual feel" of the expression.
