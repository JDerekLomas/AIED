As a specialist in diagnostic assessment, I have analysed the multi-step nature of this question. This question tests a student's ability to navigate inverse operations across two distinct stages of a linear equation.

### 1. Analysis of Wrong Options

*   **Option B (Only step 2): "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse"**
    *   **Reasoning:** The student believes Step 1 is wrong because they failed to use the inverse (perhaps thinking Isaac should have subtracted 4 from 15). However, they look at Step 2 ($60=1+k \rightarrow 61=k$) and see that Isaac added 1 to 60. Since there is a $+1$ in the equation, the student incorrectly assumes that "adding" is the correct movement to "process" that number. They value "doing the same thing" over the principle of balancing.
*   **Option C (Both steps are correct): The "Directional Confusion" error**
    *   **Reasoning:** The student correctly identifies that $15 \times 4 = 60$ (Step 1). However, in Step 2, they see the symbols $60, 1, k$ and a $+$ sign. They perform the addition ($60 + 1 = 61$) without considering the "equals" sign as a wall that requires an inverse operation. This is often driven by a "left-to-right" processing habit where they just combine the available terms.
*   **Option D (Both steps are incorrect): The "Priority of Operations" or "Over-complication" error**
    *   **Reasoning:** The student likely fails Step 1 because they think they must deal with the $+1$ before the division by 4 (misapplying BIDMAS rules to solving). They then see Step 2 is definitely "wrong" because it doesn't match their expected $60 - 1 = 59$. Because Step 1 didn't happen "their way," they dismiss the whole logic.

### 2. Attractiveness of Errors

*   **Option C (The most attractive distractor):** This is incredibly seductive. Students often feel "successful" after completing Step 1 correctly. When they see $60=1+k$, the instinct to simply combine the numbers they see ($60+1$) is very high, especially under time pressure. They won't notice they are wrong because $61$ feels like a "neat" answer. This is very common among **Basic** and **Lower-Proficient** students.
*   **Option B:** This is less attractive because it requires the student to simultaneously think Isaac failed the first part (multiplication) but succeeded in the second part by "using the same sign." This usually only occurs in students with very high **Below Basic** cognitive load issues.
*   **Option D:** This attracts students who are over-confident in a specific "rule" (like always moving the constant first) and therefore reject a mathematically sound first step.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

This question is a "trap" for students who are good at arithmetic but weak at the formal "Balance Method."

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Same Op) | C (Both Correct) | D (Both Incorrect) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | 30% | 40% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 15% | 50% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 65% | 5% | 25% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 92% | 1% | 5% | 2% |

**Key Insight for Instruction:** The transition from Basic to Proficient in this topic hinges entirely on Step 2. Students who choose **C** understand the *mechanics* of multiplication but do not yet understand the *concept* of inverse operations to isolate a variable. In UK classrooms, this is the classic "I thought I moved the 1 over" mistake.
