Hello, I’m glad to help you analyse this question. Adding mixed numbers with different denominators is a classic "trap" area in the UK Key Stage 3 and GCSE curriculum because it requires multiple steps: managing the whole numbers, finding a common denominator, and often handling an improper fraction at the end.

Here is my diagnostic breakdown.

### 1. Analysis of Wrong Answer Options

**Option A: $\frac{99}{20}$ (The "Correct Value, Incorrect Form" Error)**
*   **Reasoning:** The student correctly adds the fractions ($2 \frac{14}{20} + 2 \frac{5}{20} = 4 \frac{19}{20}$) and then correctly converts this back into an improper fraction: $(4 \times 20) + 19 = 99 \div 20 = \frac{99}{20}$.
*   **Error:** This is a **rubric/instruction failure** rather than a mathematical misunderstanding. The student missed the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number."

**Option C: $\frac{99}{40}$ (The "Add everything" / Common Denominator Multiplication Error)**
*   **Reasoning:** (As specified) The student adds the numerators and denominators.
*   **Calculation:** They likely convert to improper fractions first: $\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4}$. They then add numerators ($27+9=36$) and denominators ($10+4=14$), but usually, students following this specific path for this question might multiply the denominators to get 40, and somehow arrive at 99 through a messy combination of multiplying $27 \times 4 = 108$ then getting confused.
*   **Correction to your prompt's premise:** Actually, $4 \frac{8}{14}$ (Option D) is the most direct result of "adding the numerators and denominators." If a student chooses **C**, they have likely found a common denominator of 40 ($108/40 + 90/40$), added them to get $198/40$, and simplified to $99/20$ (Option A) but accidentally left the denominator as 40 or made a calculation slip in the simplification.

**Option D: $4 \frac{8}{14}$ (The "Universal Additive" Misconception)**
*   **Reasoning:** This is the purest form of the misconception: $2+2=4$, then $7+1=8$ (numerators) and $10+4=14$ (denominators).
*   **Error:** The student treats the fraction bar as a separator rather than a divisor, applying the rules of integer addition to both components independently.

### 2. Attractiveness of Errors

*   **Option A ($\frac{99}{20}$): High Attractiveness for Mid-to-High Ability.** These students are mathematically fluent and often convert to improper fractions as a "safe" default method for all fraction operations. Their error is speed-based; they finish the hard maths and forget the formatting requirement.
*   **Option C ($\frac{99}{40}$): Moderate Attractiveness for Lower-Mid Ability.** It looks "mathsy" because of the larger numbers. Students who know they should multiply denominators but forget to adjust numerators (cross-multiplying) often end up with denominators of 40 and "random" looking numerators.
*   **Option D ($4 \frac{8}{14}$): Extremely High Attractiveness for Lower Ability.** This is the "default" intuition. It feels logical to a student who doesn't understand the concept of a "part of a whole." They will not notice they are wrong because the steps are simple and consistent with how they add whole numbers.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

| Level | A (Improper) | B (Correct) | C (Slip) | D (Add Denom) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 5% | 10% | 15% | **70%** |
| **Basic** | 15% | **40%** | 10% | 35% |
| **Proficient** | 20% | **70%** | 5% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 10% | **88%** | 1% | 1% |

**Summary of Prediction:**
*   **Below Basic** students will almost exclusively flock to **D** because it requires no knowledge of common denominators.
*   **Proficient** students will occasionally hit **A** because they are taught to prefer improper fractions at GCSE/Secondary level and may ignore the "mixed number" instruction.
*   The gap between **Basic** and **Proficient** is defined by whether the student can successfully find the common denominator of 20 versus simply adding across.
