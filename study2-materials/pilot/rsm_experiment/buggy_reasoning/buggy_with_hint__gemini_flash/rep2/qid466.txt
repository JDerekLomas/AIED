As a specialist in mathematical diagnostics, I have analysed the question and the potential student errors.

The problem $-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$ tests two distinct areas of fluency: understanding **reciprocals (multiplicative inverses)** and the **arithmetic of signed numbers**.

### 1. Analysis of Wrong Answer Options

*   **Option B: $-\frac{4}{3}$**
    *   **Buggy Reasoning:** The student correctly identifies that they need the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$ to get the numeral $1$. However, they believe that "to keep the answer negative, the multiplier must also be negative." They are applying the rule for addition (a negative plus a negative is more negative) or simply have a fragile grasp of the sign rules, believing that multiplying two negatives results in a negative.
    *   **Attractiveness:** This is highly attractive because the student has successfully performed the "hard" part of the maths (the fraction inversion) but falls at the final sign hurdle.

*   **Option C: $\frac{3}{4}$**
    *   **Buggy Reasoning:** This is a "visual matching" error combined with a misunderstanding of identity. The student see a negative on the left and a negative on the right and assumes they need a positive number to keep it "the same." They mistake the goal of reaching **$-1$** for a goal of maintaining the **value** of $-\frac{3}{4}$. They treat the multiplication like a multiplication by 1.
    *   **Attractiveness:** Moderately attractive for lower-attaining students who lack confidence in fraction division/inverses and default to picking a number already present in the question.

*   **Option D: $-\frac{3}{4}$**
    *   **Buggy Reasoning:** This stems from a confusion between "squaring" and "inverting," or a complete guess based on visual symmetry. Alternatively, the student might be confusing the rule for **adding** a negative with multiplying. They see $-1$ and think "subtracting something might get me there," or they simply replicate the original fraction.
    *   **Attractiveness:** Low. This is usually a "distractor for the distracted," chosen by students who are overwhelmed by the fraction notation.

### 2. Judging the Attractiveness

*   **Option B is a "High-Quality Distractor."** It feels like a "reasonable" next step because many students have been told "multiplying by a negative makes it negative." Without a solid grasp of the "Two negatives make a positive" rule, the result $-1$ feels like it *should* come from negative inputs. This is most common at **Basic** and **Proficient** levels.
*   **Option C** is the classic "I don't know how to solve for $x$, so I'll pick a number that looks familiar" error. This is very common at the **Below Basic** level.
*   **Option A (The Correct Answer)** requires the student to hold two facts in their head simultaneously: the reciprocal rule AND the fact that Negative $\times$ Positive $=$ Negative.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

**Below Basic:** These students often ignore the sign entirely and guess based on the numbers visible. They struggle with the concept of a reciprocal.
**Basic:** These students understand they need to "flip" the fraction but are highly susceptible to the misconception in Option B.
**Proficient:** These students generally know the rules but may make a "silly mistake" under time pressure, leaning toward B.
**Advanced:** High accuracy expected; errors would likely be rare lapses in concentration.

| Level | A (Correct) | B (Misconception) | C (Visual Match) | D (Low Effort) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 30% | 35% | 15% |
| **Basic** | 35% | 45% | 15% | 5% |
| **Proficient** | 75% | 20% | 3% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 96% | 3% | 1% | 0% |

**Diagnostic Note:** If a student chooses **B**, don't just teach them fractions again; they likely understand fractions. Instead, provide targeted intervention on the **multiplication sign rules**, specifically contrasting $-(a) \times (b)$ with $-(a) \times -(b)$.
