As an experienced examiner and lead teacher, I have analysed this specific question on one-step linear equations involving fractions. These questions are notoriously high-yield for diagnostic purposes because students often find it difficult to process an integer coefficient alongside a fractional constant.

### 1. Analysis of Wrong Answer Options

**Option A: $p = \frac{1}{4}$**
*   **Reasoning:** As identified, the student uses the **same operation** instead of the inverse. Seeing the $3$ and the $12$ (as a denominator), they simply multiply $12 \times \frac{1}{3}$ or more likely, perceive that since 3 goes into 12 four times, they should perform that division: $12 \div 3 = 4$, keeping it as a denominator. Effectively: $\frac{1}{12 \div 3}$.
*   **Error Category:** Using the same operation/Misapplication of division.

**Option C: $p = 4$**
*   **Reasoning:** This is the **"Ignore the Fraction"** error combined with a reversal of terms. The student ignores the $1/...$ structure entirely. They look at 3 and 12 and identify the relationship $12 \div 3 = 4$. This is a "common sense" result for students who find fractions intimidating and default to whole-number arithmetic.
*   **Error Category:** Reduction to whole numbers / Number grabbing.

**Option D: $p = \frac{1}{9}$**
*   **Reasoning:** The student knows they need to perform an operation involving the 3 and the 12, but they **subtract** the coefficient from the denominator ($12 - 3 = 9$). This happens when a student has a weak grasp of algebraic notation (seeing $3p$ as $3 + p$) or is desperately looking for a "clean" integer relationship in the denominator.
*   **Error Category:** Conceptual misunderstanding of coefficient notation / Subtraction as an "inverse" for everything.

### 2. Evaluation of "Attractiveness"

*   **Option A ($\frac{1}{4}$): Very Highly Attractive.** This is the "Gold Standard" of mistakes for this level. The student feels they are being clever by "doing something" with the 3 and the 12. Because $12 \div 3$ works perfectly, it feels "right." To a struggling student, "solving" means making the numbers smaller or more manageable; $\frac{1}{4}$ feels like a cleaner version of $\frac{1}{12}$.
*   **Option C (4): Highly Attractive (Lower Ability).** Students working at 'Below Basic' often experience "Fraction Blindness." They extract the 3 and the 12 and perform the most comfortable operation possible. They won't notice they are wrong because they have ignored the structure of the equation entirely.
*   **Option D ($\frac{1}{9}$): Moderately Attractive.** Usually chosen by students who remember "do the same to both sides" but confuse the operation or see the 3 as being added to the $p$ ($3 + p$ instead of $3 \times p$).

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

This question is a classic "separator" in UK Year 8 or 9 (Key Stage 3) assessments.

| Ability Level | A ($\frac{1}{4}$) | B ($\frac{1}{36}$) | C (4) | D ($\frac{1}{9}$) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 35% | 10% | 40% | 15% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 30% | 15% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 20% | 75% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 5% | 94% | 0% | 1% |

**Commentary on distribution:**
*   **Below Basic:** Option C dominates because these students avoid fractions entirely.
*   **Basic:** This is the peak for **Option A**. These students know they have to divide, but they don't understand the mechanics of dividing a fraction by an integer ($\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$). They divide the *denominator* by 3 instead.
*   **Proficient/Advanced:** The error rate drops significantly as students become comfortable with the concept that dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying the denominator by 3.
