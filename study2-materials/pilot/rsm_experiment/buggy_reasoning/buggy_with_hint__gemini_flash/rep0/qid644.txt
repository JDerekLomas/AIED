Hello. As a specialist in mathematical error analysis, I have reviewed the question $(2p-1)(3p-4)$. The arrows specifically highlight the multiplication of the constant terms: $(-1) \times (-4)$.

Here is the diagnostic breakdown of the student errors:

### 1. Analysis of Wrong Answer Options

*   **Option B: $-4$ (Known Misconception: "Negative $\times$ Negative = Negative")**
    *   **Reasoning:** The student correctly identifies the operation as multiplication and correctly identifies the absolute value ($1 \times 4 = 4$). However, they follow the intuitive but incorrect rule that "negative numbers always result in negative answers" or "adding two negatives makes a bigger negative, so multiplying should too." They fail to apply the sign rule for multiplication.
*   **Option C: $+5$ (Misconception: Operational Confusion / Addition)**
    *   **Reasoning:** The student sees the numbers $-1$ and $-4$ and, rather than multiplying (as required for expanding brackets), they perform addition. Specifically, they may think they are "combining" the terms. Because both numbers are negative, they might use the absolute values ($1 + 4 = 5$) and incorrectly assign a positive sign, perhaps confusing the multiplication sign rule ($-\text{ve} \times -\text{ve} = +\text{ve}$) with an addition process.
*   **Option D: $-5$ (Misconception: Summation of Directed Numbers)**
    *   **Reasoning:** Similar to Option C, the student defaults to addition instead of multiplication. However, they are slightly more proficient with directed numbers than the Option C student; they correctly calculate $-1 + (-4) = -5$. This error often occurs when a student is overwhelmed by the "FOIL" or "Grid" process and reverts to the simpler operation of addition.

### 2. Attractiveness of Errors

*   **Option B (The Negative Product):** **High Attractiveness.** This is the most "sophisticated" error. The student knows they must multiply and knows the digits involved. It is a very common slip for students at the **Basic** and **Proficient** levels who haven't fully cemented their integer rules under the cognitive load of algebra. They won't notice the error because "$-4$" feels like it belongs with the negative numbers in the brackets.
*   **Option D (The Sum):** **Moderate Attractiveness.** This is common for **Below Basic** students who see two numbers next to each other and instinctively sum them. Because "$-5$" is a common result of $-1$ and $-4$, it looks like a "familiar" friend in the multiple-choice list.
*   **Option C (The Positive Sum):** **Low Attractiveness.** This requires two levels of error: performing the wrong operation (addition) AND getting the sign wrong for that operation. It is most likely to be a "distractor" chosen by students guessing or fundamentally confused by the concept of directed numbers.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

As an experienced teacher, I anticipate that even proficient students will fall for the sign error (Option B) if they are working too quickly, while lower-ability students will struggle with the distinction between multiplication and addition (Option D).

| Group | A (Correct) | B (Neg x Neg = Neg) | C (Pos. Sum) | D (Neg. Sum) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 30% | 15% | 35% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 35% | 5% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 80% | 15% | 2% | 3% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 2% | 0% | 0% |

**Note on "Proficient" students:** These students usually know the rule "minus times minus makes a plus," but in the context of a full expansion, the pressure to compute four different terms often leads to "System 1" thinking, where they revert to the Option B error.
