Hello, I am happy to help. This question is a classic test of a student’s understanding of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

In my experience, the hierarchy of operators is one of the most persistent hurdles in Key Stage 3 and early GCSE preparation. Here is my diagnostic breakdown.

### 1. Analysis of Misconceptions

**Correct Answer: A (6)**
*Reasoning:* Multiply first ($4 \times 2 = 8$), then handle addition and subtraction from left to right: $3 - 5 = -2$, and $-2 + 8 = 6$.

**Option B: 4 (The Target Misconception)**
*Buggy Reasoning:* **"Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order."**
The student reads the expression like a sentence:
1. $3 - 5 = -2$
2. $-2 + 4 = 2$
3. $2 \times 2 = 4$
*Attractiveness:* **High.** This is the most intuitive "human" way to read. For lower-ability students, the concept that math has a hidden structural "grammar" that overrides the left-to-right flow is counter-intuitive. They likely won't even realize they've made an error.

**Option C: -12**
*Buggy Reasoning:* **Misinterpreting the addition priority.**
Students are often taught BIDMAS literally (Addition before Subtraction). This leads to a common "Bracket-itis" error:
1. $4 \times 2 = 8$
2. "Add" before subtract: $5 + 8 = 13$
3. $3 - 13 = -10$ (See Option D).
Wait—how do we get $-12$? This happens when the student carries out operations from left to right *after* multiplying, but struggles with the directed numbers:
1. $4 \times 2 = 8$
2. $3 - 5 = -2$
3. $-2$ and $8 \rightarrow$ Student incorrectly multiplies or combines these as if looking for a larger negative: $3 - (5+4) \times 2 = 3 - 18 = -15$... or more likely: $(3-5+4) \times 2$ where the student does $3-(5+4)$ as the first step.
*Attractiveness:* **Low.** This usually requires two distinct errors: one in priority and one in basic arithmetic.

**Option D: -10**
*Buggy Reasoning:* **Strict BIDMAS (A before S) without understanding they are equal priority.**
A very common error for mid-tier students:
1. Multiply: $4 \times 2 = 8$
2. Add: $5 + 8 = 13$
3. Subtract: $3 - 13 = -10$
*Attractiveness:* **Extremely High.** This is the most "academic" error. A student chooses this because they *know* a rule (BIDMAS) but haven't mastered the nuance that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be done left-to-right. They feel they have been diligent.

### 2. Judging Attractiveness

*   **Option B (The "Sentence" approach)** is the dominant error for students who haven't memorized the rules. It is easy, feels "natural," and is very hard to unlearn.
*   **Option D (The "Strict Rule" approach)** is the dominant error for students who *have* been taught the rule but have a shallow understanding. It is very "attractive" because it feels like following instructions.
*   **Option C** is the "white noise" error, usually representing a chaotic combination of mistakes.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

As a teacher, I see "Below Basic" students default to the visual flow (B), while "Basic/Proficient" students get caught in the Addition-Subtraction trap (D). Only when they hit "Advanced" (understanding the equal status of Addition/Subtraction) do they consistently hit A.

| Group | A (6) | B (4) | C (-12) | D (-10) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 10% | **65%** | 5% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 30% | 5% | **40%** |
| **Proficient** | **55%** | 10% | 0% | 35% |
| **Advanced** | **95%** | 2% | 0% | 3% |

*Note: In the Basic category, Option D actually becomes more common than B as students move away from "intuitive" math toward "rule-based" math but lack full mastery.*
