As a specialist in diagnostic assessment, I have analysed this question focusing on the algebraic manipulation required to rearrange the sphere volume formula: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

### 1. Analysis of Wrong Answer Options

**Option A (The specified misconception): "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."**
*   **Reasoning:** The student knows the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. To isolate $r$, they see $\frac{4}{3}$ and $\pi$. Instead of dividing by these terms (the inverse), they multiply $V$ by them. This leads to $V \times \frac{4}{3} \times \pi$, then taking the cube root to find $r$.
*   **Result:** $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4V\pi}{3}}$.

**Option B: Reciprocal error / Selective inversion.**
*   **Reasoning:** The student successfully moves the $\pi$ (by dividing) but fails to correctly "flip" the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$. They likely see the 4 and 3 and simply keep them in their original positions relative to the fraction bar (4 on top, 3 on bottom) while moving them to the other side of the equals sign. This is a common error in "cross-multiplication" where students lose track of the numerator/denominator relationship.
*   **Result:** $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4V}{3\pi}}$.

**Option D: Order of operations / Scope of the root.**
*   **Reasoning:** The student correctly identifies the inverse operations (multiply by 3, divide by 4 and $\pi$) but fails to apply the cube root to the entire expression. They may cube root $V$ first and then attempt to multiply by the fraction. It also demonstrates a lack of understanding of the vinculum (fraction bar) as a grouping symbol.
*   **Result:** $r = \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{V}}{4\pi}$.

### 2. Attractiveness of Errors

*   **Option A (High Attractiveness for Lower Sets):** This is a classic "clutching at straws" error. For a student who doesn't understand "doing the same to both sides," they see numbers and letters and just combine them. It looks "maths-like" because it uses all the right components from the formula.
*   **Option B (High Attractiveness for Middle Sets):** This is the most "dangerous" distractor. Even students who understand inverse operations often get confused about which way a fraction flips when moving it across an equals sign. It feels like a very "reasonable" next step if they are rushing.
*   **Option D (Low/Moderate Attractiveness):** This usually occurs when a student tries to do the rearrangement entirely in their head or on a non-fraction-display calculator. It’s less likely to be chosen if the student is writing out steps, as the cube root is clearly the final act of the process.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

This question tests two things: memory of the volume formula and algebraic rearrangement skills. I expect significant "noise" in the data from students who have forgotten the $4/3$ or $\pi$ altogether, but among those attempting the algebra:

| Group | A | B | C (Correct) | D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 45% | 25% | 15% | 15% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 35% | 30% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 10% | 20% | 65% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 5% | 92% | 1% |

**Key takeaway for teachers:** 
If a student chooses **A**, they need to go back to one-step equations (e.g., $5x = 10$). If they choose **B**, they understand the concept of isolating a variable but need more practice with the "Reciprocal Rule" for fractional coefficients.
