As a specialist in mathematical diagnostics, I have analysed this question focusing on the structural relationships between reciprocals and signs. Here is the breakdown of the errors and the projected student responses.

### 1. Analysis of Wrong Options

*   **Option B: $-\frac{4}{3}$**
    *   **Misconception:** **Believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer.**
    *   **Reasoning Chain:** The student correctly identifies that they need the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$ (which is $\frac{4}{3}$) to get the magnitude "1". However, they see a negative in the question and a negative in the target answer $(-1)$. They follow a logic of "consistency": *Negative $\times$ Something = Negative*, therefore the *Something* must also be negative. They fail to apply the rule that $(- \times - = +)$.

*   **Option C: $\frac{3}{4}$**
    *   **Misconception:** **Confusion between "reciprocal" and "additive inverse," or simply identity-fixation.**
    *   **Reasoning Chain:** The student looks at $-\frac{3}{4} \times \star = -1$ and incorrectly interprets the relationship as additive ($-\frac{3}{4} + \star \approx 0$ type logic) or simply chooses a familiar number from the prompt. They ignore the operation (multiplication) and focus on the result being "-1", assuming that multiplying by the positive version of the same number might yield a negative result without changing the value significantly.

*   **Option D: $-\frac{3}{4}$**
    *   **Misconception:** **Identity confusion or "Echo" error.**
    *   **Reasoning Chain:** This is a "safety" choice. The student lacks the procedural knowledge to calculate a reciprocal. They see a negative on both sides of the equals sign and decide that multiplying a number by itself is the most likely way to maintain its "sign type." Alternatively, they confuse the identity property of 1 ($n \times 1 = n$) with the requirement to produce 1.

### 2. Attractiveness of Errors

*   **Option B (High Attractiveness):** This is the most "sophisticated" error. It attracts students who understand fractions and reciprocals (Grade 4/5 level) but have a shaky grasp of directed number rules. It feels highly "reasonable" because the answer is negative, so many students intuitively feel the working must involve a negative.
*   **Option C (Low/Medium Attractiveness):** This is usually a sign of a student guessing or confusing different "fraction flips." It is less attractive because it doesn't solve the magnitude problem (3/4 $\times$ 3/4 = 9/16, not 1).
*   **Option D (Low Attractiveness):** Primarily a "placeholder" guess for students who are completely overwhelmed by the presence of both fractions and negative signs.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

I have weighted these based on the fact that the negative sign is often the primary "decoy" that derails otherwise proficient students.

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Misconception) | C (Reciprocal Error) | D (Identity/Guess) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 40% | 20% | 25% |
| **Basic** | 35% | 45% | 10% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 70% | 25% | 3% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 95% | 4% | 1% | 0% |

**Diagnostic Note:** Option B will be your "high-frequency distractor." Even proficient students who are rushing often fall for Option B because the "balance" of negative signs in the equation $-\frac{3}{4} \times -\frac{4}{3} = -1$ looks visually "right" to a tired eye, despite being mathematically "wrong."
