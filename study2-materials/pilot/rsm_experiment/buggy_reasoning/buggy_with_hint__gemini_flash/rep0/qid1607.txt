As an experienced teacher, I see these multi-step "error identification" questions frequently in GCSE and Key Stage 3 assessments. They are cognitively demanding because they require students to perform two distinct checks, and many students stop after finding one error.

### 1. Analysis of Distractors

**Option B: Only step 2 is correct**
*   **Misconception:** "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
*   **Buggy Reasoning:** To get from $60 = 1 + k$ to the next step, the student sees a $+1$. Instead of performing the inverse operation (subtracting 1), they apply the same operation: $60 + 1 = 61$. Crucially, they may believe Step 1 is wrong because they didn't multiply the *entire* side (a common confusion with brackets) or they simply failed to check it, assuming if the "add" step looks right, it's the only correct one.

**Option C: Both steps are correct**
*   **Buggy Reasoning:** "Cumulative acceptance/Calculation blindness."
*   **Logic:** The student confirms Step 1 is correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$). They then look at Step 2; they see a '1' and a '60' and see a '61'. Because $60 + 1 = 61$ is a "true" arithmetic fact, their brain accepts the transition without checking the algebraic validity (the inverse operation rule). They are focused on arithmetic computation rather than algebraic transformation.

**Option D: Both steps are incorrect**
*   **Buggy Reasoning:** "Misunderstanding of the division bar or reverse-engineering error."
*   **Logic:** A student might believe that in Step 1, you should subtract 1 *before* multiplying by 4 (a BODMAS/BIDMAS confusion). Or, they may have correctly identified that Step 2 is wrong, and because they are unsure of the fractional notation in Step 1, they "play it safe" by declaring the whole process a mess.

### 2. Attractiveness of Errors

*   **Option C (The most "attractive" trap):** This is highly seductive. For a mid-level student, Step 1 is a clear "success" (they know $15 \times 4$). When they see $61$ in Step 2, it "looks" right because $60+1$ is $61$. Students often fail to switch their brains from "Mental Arithmetic Mode" to "Algebraic Inverse Mode." They won't notice they went wrong because the arithmetic is correct.
*   **Option B (The targeted misconception):** This is very common for "Basic" level students who associate the presence of a sign with its application (I see a plus, so I plus). However, it is slightly less attractive as an answer choice here because the student must also actively decide that Step 1 is wrong to pick B.
*   **Option D (The "Doubt" trap):** Least attractive to most, except for those who are completely overwhelmed by fractions and assume the teacher has provided a "trick" where everything is wrong.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

Students at **Below Basic** often guess or fixate on the most recent number they saw ($61$). **Proficient** students are the most likely to fall for **Option C** because they are confident enough to do the sum but not disciplined enough to check the inverse.

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Targeted Error) | C (Computation Trap) | D (General Confusion) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 35% | 30% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 35% | 25% | 30% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 65% | 10% | 20% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 92% | 2% | 5% | 1% |

**Teacher's Note:** To move students from Proficient to Advanced, I would use this question to highlight the **"Cover-up Method"** or the **"Change side, change sign"** mantra to ensure they treat the transition between steps as a change in operation, not just a chance to do mental addition.
