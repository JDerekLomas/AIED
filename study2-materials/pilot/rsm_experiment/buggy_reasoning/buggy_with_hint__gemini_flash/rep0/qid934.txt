As a specialist in diagnostic assessment, I have analysed this question based on common algebraic pitfalls observed in UK classrooms.

To solve the question correctly:
1. Substitute $x=0$ into $4x + 2y = 10$.
2. $4(0) + 2y = 10 \implies 2y = 10$.
3. $y = 10 \div 2 = \mathbf{5}$ (Correct Answer: **C**).

### 1. Analysis of Wrong Answer Options

#### **Option A: 20 (The Target Misconception)**
*   **Reasoning:** The student simplifies $4(0) + 2y = 10$ to $2y = 10$. Instead of using the inverse operation (division), they use the same operation ($10 \times 2$). 
*   **Attractiveness:** High for lower-attaining students. There is a "common sense" reflex that because multiplication is present in $2y$, they should multiply to "join" the numbers.
*   **Likelihood:** High at **Below Basic** and **Basic** levels where inverse operations are not yet fluent.

#### **Option B: 3**
*   **Reasoning:** The student confuses the coefficients. They mistakenly think they need to solve $4 + 2 + y = 10$ or, more commonly, they substitute $x=0$ but then perform $(10 - 4) \div 2$, incorrectly thinking the "4" must be subtracted regardless of the value of $x$. 
*   **Attractiveness:** Low to Moderate. This usually stems from a memorised "recipe" (subtract then divide) applied without looking at the variables.
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate for **Basic** students who are over-reliant on fixed steps for solving linear equations.

#### **Option D: 2.5**
*   **Reasoning:** The student ignores the $2y$ and treats it as $4y$. They solve $4y = 10$. Alternatively, they think they must divide 10 by the sum of the coefficients ($4+2=6$, $10/6 \approx$ incorrect) or more likely, they perform $10 \div 4$ (forgetting $x=0$ means $4x$ vanishes, but still dividing by the first number they see).
*   **Attractiveness:** Moderate. Students often see the first coefficient as the "primary" divisor.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Moderate for **Basic/Proficient** levels who over-complicate the substitution.

### 2. Judging the "Attractiveness" of Errors

1.  **Option A (20):** Extremely attractive to students who struggle with the "balance" method. Multiplication feels more "powerful" than division, and 20 is a "tidy" number. It is a classic error of operational direction.
2.  **Option B (3):** Attractive to students who skip the substitution step entirely and jump straight to solving $4+2y=10$. It feels like a "reasonable" algebraic result.
3.  **Option D (2.5):** Less attractive but captures those who have a vague memory that "algebra involves dividing at the end" but choose the wrong coefficient to divide by.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

This table predicts how different ability groups (relative to UK GCSE benchmarks) would engage with this specific diagnostic question.

| Level | A (20) | B (3) | C (5) - Correct | D (2.5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 45% | 15% | 20% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 20% | 40% | 15% |
| **Proficient** | 10% | 5% | 80% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 1% | 96% | 1% |

**Summary for the Teacher:** 
The "star" is placed at $x=0$ specifically to see if the student can handle the vanishing term. If the most common wrong answer is **A**, your intervention should focus on inverse operations. If it is **B**, your focus should be on the substitution step and the meaning of $4x$ (i.e., that $4 \times 0$ is 0, not 4).
