This question is an excellent diagnostic tool for identifying whether students understand the order of operations and the rules of manipulation when "undoing" an equation.

The correct answer is **C) Both Tom and Katie.**
Tom has added 5 to both sides ($12+5=17$).
Katie has multiplied the entire equation by 3 ($x - (5 \times 3) = 12 \times 3$).

### 1. Misconception Analysis

**Option A: Only Tom (Distractor)**
*   **Buggy Reasoning:** The student recognizes that Tom is correct but believes Katie is wrong because they think the $-5$ must be "dealt with" first. This is a common over-reliance on the "reverse BIDMAS" rule of thumb. The student assumes that because the $3$ only divides the $x$, you cannot multiply by 3 until the $x$ is "isolated." They fail to realize that if you multiply by 3, you must multiply **every term** on both sides.
*   **Attractiveness:** Very High. Many UK teachers drill the "add/subtract first" method to avoid fractions. Students often think Katie’s method is "illegal" rather than just "alternative."

**Option B: Only Katie (Distractor)**
*   **Buggy Reasoning:** The student likely attempted to follow Tom’s logic but made a basic arithmetic error (e.g., $12 + 5 = 15$ or $12 - 5 = 7$), leading them to think Tom is wrong. Alternatively, they may have a preference for "clearing fractions" immediately and view Tom's method as "unfinished."
*   **Attractiveness:** Low to Medium. It is less common for a student to see Katie’s algebraic step as correct while dismissing Tom’s very standard addition step, unless they have made a simple calculation slip.

**Option D: Neither is correct (Targeted Misconception)**
*   **Buggy Reasoning:** "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
    *   To check Tom: The student sees $-5$ and performs $12 - 5$ to get $7$. Since Tom got $17$, they think he is wrong.
    *   To check Katie: The student sees $\div 3$ and performs $12 \div 3$ to get $4$. Since Katie got $36$, they think she is wrong.
*   **Attractiveness:** High for Lower Ability. This is the classic "operation reflex"—seeing a symbol and instinctively using it rather than its inverse.

### 2. Pedagogy and "Attractiveness" Judgment

*   **Tom’s Error Profile:** Errors regarding Tom usually stem from poor arithmetic (Basic level) or the "Same Operation" misconception.
*   **Katie’s Error Profile:** Errors regarding Katie are the most sophisticated. Many "Proficient" students will think Katie is wrong because they believe the $3$ **only** applies to the $x$, and therefore you can't multiply the $12$ by it until the $5$ is gone. They don't understand the distributive property of multiplication over the whole side of an equation.
*   **The "Trapped" Student:** A student who picks A is likely a "rule-follower" who hasn't grasped the flexibility of equality. A student who picks D is still struggling with the fundamental concept of "undoing" an operation.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

| Level | A (Only Tom) | B (Only Katie) | C (Both) | D (Neither) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 15% | 15% | **50%** |
| **Basic** | 40% | 10% | 20% | 30% |
| **Proficient** | **55%** | 5% | 35% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 10% | 2% | **88%** | 0% |

**Key Trend Explainer:**
*   **Below Basic:** Mostly fall for **D** because they haven't mastered inverse operations.
*   **Basic:** Transitioning toward inverse operations but usually only recognize one "standard" path (Tom's), often getting confused if they see two different-looking lines of working.
*   **Proficient:** These students almost always think Tom is correct. However, they are highly likely to fall for the trap that Katie is wrong because they think "you must add 5 first." This makes **A** the most common distractor for this bracket.
*   **Advanced:** Recognize that as long as the same operation is applied to every term, the equation remains balanced, validating Katie's move.
