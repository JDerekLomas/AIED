As a specialist in diagnostic assessment, I have analysed the question and the potential student pitfalls. This question testing the intersection of **algebraic substitution** and **rearranging equations** is a common friction point for GCSE Foundation students.

### 1. Analysis of Wrong Answer Options

**The Scenario:** To find the value of the star, a student must substitute $x = 0$ into $4x + 2y = 10$. This simplifies to $2y = 10$. The correct answer is **C (5)**.

*   **Option A (20): Uses the same operation rather than the inverse.**
    *   **Reasoning:** The student reaches the stage $2y = 10$. Seeing the coefficient 2, they "move" it to the other side by multiplying instead of dividing ($10 \times 2 = 20$). They associated the term $2y$ with "multiplying by 2" and simply repeated that operation on the RHS.
*   **Option B (3): Evaluates for $x = 1$ instead of $x = 0$.**
    *   **Reasoning:** The student looks at the table, ignores the $x = 0$ column, and finds $y$ for $x = 1$. $4(1) + 2y = 10 \rightarrow 2y = 6 \rightarrow y = 3$. This is a "procedural bypass" where they start with the first "interesting" value ($x=1$) rather than the one required by the star's position.
*   **Option D (2.5): Incorrect inverse order or coefficient confusion.**
    *   **Reasoning:** There are two common routes to 2.5. 1) The student forgets $x=0$ and just divides the constant by the first coefficient they see ($10 \div 4 = 2.5$). 2) They rearrange to $y = 10 \div 2 \div 2$ (accidentally halving twice). Most commonly, it is the result of $10 / 4$.

### 2. Attractiveness of Misconceptions

*   **Option A (The "Inverse" Error): Very High.**
    *   This is the classic "balance" error. Students who are taught to "do the same to both sides" often misidentify what the current operation is. If they see "multiplication," they sometimes think the rule is "just multiply." It is extremely common among Basic level students who haven't solidified inverse operations.
*   **Option B (The "Offset" Error): Medium.**
    *   Students often rush and see the sequence $x=0, 1, 2, 3...$ and mistakenly start their calculation at $x=1$ because they are used to sequences starting at the "1st term."
*   **Option D (The "Numbers in Question" Error): Low-Medium.**
    *   Often, students who are overwhelmed by the algebra just start dividing the integers they see in the prompt. $10 \div 4$ is a very "tempting" calculation because $10 \div 2$ feels too simple for an exam.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

This table estimates how different ability levels will interact with these distractors.

| Level | A (20) | B (3) | C (5) [Correct] | D (2.5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 45% | 15% | 20% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 20% | 45% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 5% | 10% | 80% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 1% | 2% | 96% | 1% |

**Commentary:**
*   **Below Basic:** A majority will fail on the inverse operation (A) or guess using the numbers $10$ and $4$ (D).
*   **Basic:** Many will identify that $x=0$ makes the $4x$ term disappear, but will still make the "inverse operation" error (A) or calculate for the wrong column (B).
*   **Proficient/Advanced:** The "zero" substitution is usually a relief for these students, though the most likely error for a Proficient student is the "Offset" error (B) due to rushing.
