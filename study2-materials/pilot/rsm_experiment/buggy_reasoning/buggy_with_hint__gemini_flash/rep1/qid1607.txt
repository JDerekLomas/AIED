As a specialist in diagnostic assessment, I have analysed this question focusing on the algebraic "balance" method and common student errors during two-step equations.

### 1. Misconception Analysis

**Option B: Only step 2 is correct**
*   **Misconception:** When solving an equation, the student uses the same operation rather than the inverse.
*   **Reasoning Chain:** The student looks at Step 1 ($60 = 1 + k$). To find $k$, they see a "$1$" and a "$+$" sign. Instead of performing the inverse operation (subtracting 1), they see the $1$ and simply add it to $60$, resulting in $61$. 
*   **Wait, why "Only" Step 2?** To choose B, the student likely thinks Step 1 is wrong (perhaps they think $15 \div 4$ should have been the first step) but believes the transition from Step 1 to Step 2 follows their logic of "combining numbers."

**Option C: Both steps are correct**
*   **Buggy Reasoning:** Over-reliance on "Number Sense" and ignoring operation signs.
*   **Reasoning Chain:** The student sees Step 1 ($60 = 15 \times 4$) and identifies this as correct. In Step 2, they see $61$, $60$, and $1$. They subconsciously feel these numbers "belong" together in a family. Because they don't rigorously check the inverse property (61 + 1 $\neq$ 60), they assume the whole process "looks right" algebraically.

**Option D: Both steps are incorrect**
*   **Buggy Reasoning:** Order of operations confusion or "Term-by-term" division error.
*   **Reasoning Chain:** The student believes Isaac should have subtracted the 1 first (a common error when the numerator is a grouping). They think $15 - 1 = 14$ then $14 \times 4 = 56$. Therefore, because Step 1 doesn't match their expected $14 = \frac{k}{4}$ or $56 = k$, they dismiss the entire working out.

### 2. Attractiveness of Errors

*   **Option B (Same operation): Very High.** This is one of the most persistent errors in Key Stage 3 (Ages 11-14). Students often treat equations like a shopping list: "I have 60 and I have 1, so that's 61." It feels natural to "bring the numbers together." They don't notice the error because $61$ is a neat, whole number.
*   **Option C (Acceptance of error): Moderate/High.** Students with "process fatigue" often verify the first step and then glance at the second. If the numbers look related, they tick "Both."
*   **Option D (Reverse confusion): Low/Moderate.** Only students who are over-thinking the "order" of operations but have a shaky foundation on fraction bars (grouping symbols) will choose this.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

This question targets a specific transition in algebraic proficiency. Step 1 is actually correct ($15 \times 4$), but Step 2 is incorrect ($60 - 1 = 59$ should be the answer). Therefore, **A is the correct answer.**

| Level | A (Correct) | B (Same Op) | C (False Positive) | D (Total Rejection) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 40% | 35% | 10% |
| **Basic** | 40% | 35% | 15% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 75% | 15% | 5% | 5% |
| **Advanced** | 95% | 2% | 1% | 2% |

**Analysis of Distribution:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the "inverse" concept. They are most likely to pick **B** or **C** because $60+1=61$ feels "right" and they lack the verification skills to see that $61+1 \neq 60$.
*   **Basic:** This group usually identifies that Step 1 is correct (they know $\times 4$ is the inverse of $\div 4$). However, under pressure, about a third will still fall for the $60+1$ "same operation" trap.
*   **Proficient:** These students have mastered the "change the side, change the sign" rule. The majority will correctly identify Step 1 as right and Step 2 as wrong.
*   **Advanced:** Only "careless slips" would prevent a 100% score here. Any errors are usually from misreading the question (Option D).
