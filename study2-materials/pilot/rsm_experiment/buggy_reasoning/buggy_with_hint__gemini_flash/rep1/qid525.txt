Hello. I am pleased to assist with this diagnostic analysis. Adding mixed numbers with different denominators is a high-stakes topic in the UK curriculum (KS2 and KS3), as it requires the synchronisation of several distinct procedural steps: managing whole numbers, finding a common denominator, and simplifying or converting results.

Here is the breakdown of the errors and the predicted student behaviour.

---

### 1. Analysis of Wrong Options

#### **Option A: \( \frac{99}{20} \)**
*   **Reasoning:** The student has performed the calculation entirely correctly, finding the common denominator (20) and arriving at the correct value. However, they **failed to read the final instruction** "Leave your answer as a mixed number." They converted their correct working into an improper fraction: $2\frac{14}{20} + 2\frac{5}{20} = 4\frac{19}{20} = \frac{99}{20}$.
*   **Attractiveness:** This is a high-level distractor. It is particularly "cruel" because the mathematical heavy lifting is correct. Students who are over-confident or rushing are most likely to pick this. They see their calculated number in the list and tick it immediately without checking the required format.

#### **Option C: \( \frac{99}{40} \)** (The specified misconception)
*   **Reasoning:** As specified, the student adds the numerators and denominators. Here, they likely converted to improper fractions first ($27/10 + 9/4$) and then added horizontally: $27+9=36$ and $10+4=14$. This doesn't lead directly to C, but a more common path for this specific option is converting to improper, finding a "common denominator" by multiplying ($10 \times 4 = 40$), but then failing to adjust the numerators correctly, or simply doing: $(27 \times 4 = 108) + (9 \times 10 = 90) = 198/40$ and then potentially simplifying or making a secondary arithmetic slip to land on 99. *Note: Most often, the "add across" error leads to $4 \frac{8}{14}$, while C represents a student trying to use 40 as a denominator but getting lost in the conversion.*
*   **Attractiveness:** Moderate. For a student who knows they need a common denominator but forgets to scale the numerators, 40 is a very tempting denominator to use.

#### **Option D: \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \)**
*   **Reasoning:** This is the most "pure" form of the specified misconception. The student adds the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), then adds the numerators ($7+1=8$), and then adds the denominators ($10+4=14$). 
*   **Attractiveness:** Extremely high for lower-ability students. It feels intuitive and "fair"—doing the same operation to the top and bottom. It requires significantly less cognitive load than finding a lowest common multiple. The student will not notice they are wrong because the answer looks "tidy."

### 2. Predicted Response Distribution

**Below Basic**
*   *A=5% B=10% C=25% D=60%*
*   **Reasoning:** These students almost universally apply additive logic to the entire fraction. Option D will be the dominant choice because it is the most direct application of their intuition.

**Basic**
*   *A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%*
*   **Reasoning:** At this level, students know "something" must happen with the denominators. They are split between the "add across" error (D) and attempting to find a common denominator of 40 but failing the execution (C). 

**Proficient**
*   *A=20% B=65% C=10% D=5%*
*   **Reasoning:** These students understand the process and will largely reach the correct value. Their main "enemy" is the format of the answer. A significant minority will do the work correctly but pick A because it matches their intermediate step ($\frac{99}{20}$) before they convert back to a mixed number.

**Advanced**
*   *A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%*
*   **Reasoning:** These students read the question carefully and have mastered the algorithm. They are unlikely to fall for the additive misconception, and usually check the required format (mixed number) before selecting their final answer.
