Hello, I am happy to help. As a specialist in error analysis, I have seen these specific misconceptions play out frequently in the classroom, particularly when students are transitioning between simple integer arithmetic and rational numbers.

Here is the diagnostic breakdown for the question:

### 1. Analysis of Buggy Reasoning

**Option B: $-\frac{4}{3}$ (Known Misconception: Negative $\times$ Negative = Negative)**
*   **Reasoning:** The student correctly identifies the need for a **reciprocal** to get a result of $1$ (inverting the fraction). However, they reason that because the answer is $-1$ (a negative), and they are starting with a negative, the multiplier must also be negative.
*   **Teacher Insight:** This is an incredibly common "logic overlap" where the student remembers "like signs" but misapplies the rule for addition/subtraction or simply forgets that a double negative yields a positive.

**Option C: $\frac{3}{4}$ (Misconception: Identity confusion or Sign neglect)**
*   **Reasoning:** The student ignores the multiplication operation and treats this as a "copying" or "balancing" task. They see $-3/4$ on one side and a negative on the other, concluding they just need to "keep the numbers the same" to maintain some form of symmetry. Alternatively, they may believe that any number multiplied by its positive self results in $-1$ if a negative is present anywhere.
*   **Teacher Insight:** This represents a low-level understanding of multiplicative inverses. They are focused on the "visual match" rather than the calculation.

**Option D: $-\frac{3}{4}$ (Misconception: Multiplication vs. Addition/Sign focus)**
*   **Reasoning:** The student likely thinks that $-\frac{3}{4}$ is "almost" $-1$. They may be confusing the operation with addition (where $-3/4 + -1/4 = -1$) or they are simply overwhelmed by the notation and choose the value already present in the question as a "safe" guess.
*   **Teacher Insight:** This often occurs with "below basic" students who have a "functional fixedness" on the numbers already visible in the prompt.

### 2. Attractiveness of Distractors

*   **Option B (High Attractiveness):** This is the "Gold Standard" of mistakes for this topic. It feels very logical to a student: "Negative start, negative finish, so I need a negative middle." Even middle-to-high ability students make this "lapse" when working quickly under pressure.
*   **Option C (Low/Medium Attractiveness):** This is usually only attractive to students who have a weak grasp of fractions. It lacks the mathematical "hook" of the reciprocal, making it easy to dismiss for anyone who knows the "flip" rule.
*   **Option D (Low Attractiveness):** This is a "noise" distractor. It usually captures students who are guessing or those who have significant confusion regarding the difference between operations (Multiplication vs. Addition).

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

The most significant shift occurs between "Basic" and "Proficient," where students learn the "flip the fraction" rule but haven't yet mastered sign consistency.

| Ability Level | A (Correct) | B (Neg x Neg = Neg) | C (Sign/Value match) | D (Repeat Value) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 35% | 25% | 25% |
| **Basic** | 30% | **50%** | 10% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | **70%** | 25% | 3% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | **95%** | 4% | 1% | 0% |

**Note on "Basic" Learners:** In UK classrooms (Year 8/9), this group often records more incorrect answers for B than correct answers for A. They have "half-learnt" the rule for reciprocals, making B an incredibly seductive trap.
