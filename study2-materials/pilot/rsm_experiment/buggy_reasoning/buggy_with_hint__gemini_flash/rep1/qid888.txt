As a specialist in diagnostic assessment, I have analysed the question and the associated distractors to identify the underlying mathematical misconceptions.

### 1. Analysis of Buggy Reasoning

**Option A: $m^2 - 2m - 35$**
*   **Reasoning:** The student has treated the constants $-5$ and $-7$ as terms to be **added together with a sign conflict**, calculating $-7 + 5$ or $5 - 7$ to get $-2$. Crucially, they have also applied a "one negative makes the whole thing negative" rule for the constant term $(-5 \times -7 = -35)$, or simply "combined" the numbers 5 and 7 without considering the sign of the product.
*   **Source of Error:** Poor integer addition (confusion between difference and sum) and sign error in multiplication.

**Option C: $m^2 + 12m + 35$**
*   **Reasoning:** This is a classic "sign blindness" error. The student ignores the negative signs within the brackets and treats the expression as $(m+5)(m+7)$. They correctly add $5+7$ to get $+12m$ and multiply $5 \times 7$ to get $+35$. 
*   **Source of Error:** Ignoring negative signs or believing that when multiplying brackets, the signs "always become plus."

**Option D: $m^2 - 12m - 35$**
*   **Reasoning (Provided):** "Believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer."
*   **Specific Chain:** The student correctly performs FOIL/Grid method. They calculate $m \times m = m^2$. They calculate $-7m - 5m = -12m$. However, when they multiply $(-5) \times (-7)$, they arrive at $-35$ because of the identified misconception.
*   **Source of Error:** Incomplete mastery of integer multiplication rules.

### 2. Attractiveness of Distractors

*   **Option D (The High-Value Distractor):** This is **highly attractive**. In the UK curriculum, students at KS3 and Foundation GCSE often struggle with the "double negative" rule. Because $-5 + (-7)$ is $-12$, students often find it logically "consistent" that $(-5) \times (-7)$ should also be negative. They see a sea of minus signs and assume the answer must be "mostly negative."
*   **Option C (The Basic Error):** This is very attractive to **Lower-Ability (Below Basic)** students. It represents a "path of least resistance" where the student only focuses on the numbers and the structure of a quadratic, ignoring the cognitive load of negative directed numbers.
*   **Option A (The Calculation Slip):** This is **moderately attractive**. It usually catches students who are rushing. They see 5 and 7 and their brain quickly jumps to the difference (2) rather than the sum (12) because they are thinking about "combining" numbers.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

This distribution reflects a typical Year 9 or Year 10 (AQA/Edexcel) cohort.

| Level | A | B (Correct) | C | D (Misconception) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 15% | 40% | 25% |
| **Basic** | 15% | 35% | 15% | 35% |
| **Proficient** | 5% | 75% | 5% | 15% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 95% | 1% | 2% |

**Commentary:**
*   **Below Basic** students often choose **C** because they simplify the problem by ignoring negatives.
*   **Basic** students are often caught in a "tug of war" between **B and D**. They know how to expand and get the "12", but their grasp of integer rules for multiplication is brittle, leading them to D.
*   **Proficient** students usually identify the correct middle term (-12) and the correct product (+35) but may occasionally slip on D if under time pressure.
*   **Advanced** students rarely fail this unless it is a "copying" error.
