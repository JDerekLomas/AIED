As a specialist in diagnostic assessment, I have analysed the substitution and rearrangement errors inherent in this linear equation problem.

The correct value for the star ($\star$) is calculated as follows:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$ (**Option C**)

### 1. Error Analysis for Distractors

**Option A ($4.25$): The Negative/Positive Swap**
*   **Reasoning:** The student substitutes $y = 0.5$ correctly but fails to account for the minus sign in the equation. They treat it as $10x + 6y = 30$.
*   **Calculation:** $10x + (6 \times 0.5) = 30 \rightarrow 10x + 3 = 30 \rightarrow 10x = 27 \rightarrow x = 2.7$. However, more commonly, a student gets to $33$ but then struggles with the division or signs elsewhere. Alternatively, a student might do $(30 + 10 + 2.5)/10$ or other convoluted logic.
*   **Most likely path to 4.25:** A common error in this specific number set is calculating $(30 + 6 + 6.5)/10$ or thinking $10x = 30 + 6(2) + 0.5$. Actually, the most direct path to $4.25$ is the "Misplaced Division": $(30 + 3) \div 10 = 3.3$, but then some students intuitively "add the 1" back from the $0.5$. Another common path is confusing $0.5$ with $5$. If $y=5$ and they subtract instead of add: $10x = 30 + 30/4$... $4.25$ is a high-level "it looks right" distractor.

**Option B ($-4.25$): The Signed Error**
*   **Reasoning:** This is usually a carry-on from the calculation above, but the student believes that since they are "moving" things across the equals sign, the final answer must be negative. They perform the calculation but attach a negative sign regardless of logic.

**Option D ($2.7$): Using the same operation rather than the inverse**
*   **Reasoning:** As specified, the student identifies that $10x - 3 = 30$. Instead of using the inverse (adding $3$), they use the operation shown in the equation (subtracting $3$).
*   **Calculation:** $10x = 30 - 3 \rightarrow 10x = 27 \rightarrow x = 2.7$.

### 2. Attractiveness of Errors

*   **Option D (The "Same Operation" Error):** **High Attractivity.** This is the most "logical" error for a student with procedural but not conceptual understanding. The "minus" is physically sitting in the equation, so the student performs a subtraction. It results in a "clean" decimal (2.7), which gives the student false confidence that they are correct.
*   **Option A:** **Moderate Attractivity.** Students who struggle with decimals or are "fishing" for numbers often find 4.25 attractive because it feels like a fraction-based answer ($1/4$), which they associate with the $0.5$ given in the question.
*   **Option B:** **Low Attractivity.** Only students who are completely guessed-out or are deeply confused by "change the side, change the sign" rules tend to pick the negative version of an already incorrect answer.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

As a teacher, I expect Option D to be the primary distractor for students who can substitute but cannot solve.

| Level | A (4.25) | B (-4.25) | C (3.3) - Correct | D (2.7) - Misconception |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 25% | 20% | 15% | 40% |
| **Basic** | 15% | 5% | 40% | 40% |
| **Proficient** | 5% | 2% | 80% | 13% |
| **Advanced** | 1% | 1% | 96% | 2% |

**Note on "Basic" students:** This cohort is the most likely to fall for Option D. They have the skill to multiply $6 \times 0.5 = 3$ and divide by $10$, but the algebraic "bridge" (adding rather than subtracting) is where their knowledge breaks down. Proficiency is reached when the student consistently applies inverse operations correctly.
