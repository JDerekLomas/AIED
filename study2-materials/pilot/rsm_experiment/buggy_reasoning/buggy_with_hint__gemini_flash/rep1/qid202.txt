As a UK maths teacher, I see this specific question type frequently in Key Stage 2 (Year 5/6) and early Key Stage 3 (Year 7). It tests the foundational concept of maintaining the "denominator as the unit" when performing addition.

### 1. Analysis of Wrong Answer Options

**Option B: \( \frac{18}{5} \)**
*   **Buggy Reasoning:** The student calculates the correct value but ignores the specific instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number." They likely convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions first ($11/5 + 7/5$), add them to get $18/5$, and stop there, feeling satisfied that they have performed a "mathematical" conversion.
*   **Attractiveness:** Very high for students who have recently mastered improper fractions. They often feel that improper fractions are "more mathematical" than mixed numbers and fail to read the final line of the prompt.

**Option C: \( \frac{18}{10} \)**
*   **Buggy Reasoning:** This is a "double-error" choice. The student converts to improper fractions ($11/5$ and $7/5$) but then applies the denominator-addition misconception ($5+5=10$) while adding them. They combine a sophisticated skill (conversion) with a primitive misconception.
*   **Attractiveness:** Low to Moderate. It is less common than Option D because if a student knows how to convert to $11/5$, they usually have a slightly firmer grasp of the denominator's role than those who stay in mixed number form.

**Option D: \( 3 \frac{3}{10} \)**
*   **Buggy Reasoning:** (As specified) "When adding fractions, adds the numerators and denominators." The student adds the integers ($2+1=3$), adds the numerators ($1+2=3$), and adds the denominators ($5+5=10$).
*   **Attractiveness:** Extremely High for lower-ability students. It follows a "logical" linear symmetry (do the same to the top as you do to the bottom) and mirrors the rules for multiplying fractions, which often causes interference.

### 2. Judging the Buggy Reasoning Chains

*   **Option D (The "Add Everything" Error):** This is the most natural pitfall. It feels "fair" to a student. Because they don't have a conceptual image of the "fifths" being the size of the slices, they treat the numbers as isolated digits. They won't notice the error because $3/10$ is smaller than the original fractions, which doesn't immediately trigger an "estimate check" in their heads. **Most likely at Below Basic and Basic levels.**

*   **Option B (The "Format" Error):** This is a classic "Fluency vs. Problem Solving" error. The student has the technical skill but lacks the attention to detail for the constraint. They won't notice they are wrong because, mathematically, $18/5$ is equivalent to $3 \frac{3}{5}$. **Most likely at Proficient level.**

*   **Option C (The "Confused Intermediate"):** This is less attractive because it requires more steps to reach a wrong answer. It usually occurs when a student is overwhelmed by the process of "cross-multiplying" or "finding a common denominator" even when they don't need to.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

**Below Basic:** These students struggle with the concept of a fraction as a single value and treat it as two separate whole numbers separated by a line.
**Basic:** These students can handle whole numbers but revert to "simple" rules for the fractional parts.
**Proficient:** These students know the rules but often over-complicate the working or rush the final formatting.
**Advanced:** These students recognise the common denominators immediately and follow instructions.

| Level | A (Correct) | B (Format Error) | C (Combo Error) | D (Add Denoms) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 15% | 5% | 15% | 65% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 10% | 5% | 40% |
| **Proficient** | 75% | 15% | 2% | 8% |
| **Advanced** | 96% | 3% | 0% | 1% |
