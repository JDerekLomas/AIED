Hello. As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen thousands of students grapple with the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). This specific question is a brilliant diagnostic tool because it highlights the subtle difference between "Operation Priority" (Multiply vs. Add) and "Equal Priority" (Subtract vs. Add).

Here is my diagnostic analysis of the options and student reasoning.

---

### 1. Analysis of Wrong Answer Options

#### **Option A: Problem P: \(4-5\); Problem Q: \(4+5\)**
*   **Buggy Reasoning:** As identified, the student **carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order**. They treat mathematics like reading a sentence. They do not look ahead to see if a high-priority operator (like $\times$) exists; they simply execute the first operation their eyes land on.
*   **Attractiveness:** **Very High.** This is the most "natural" way for a human to process information. For a student who hasn't fully internalised BIDMAS, there is no internal "alarm" telling them to skip the addition and look at the multiplication. It is the default setting for novice learners.

#### **Option C: Problem P: \(5+6\); Problem Q: \(4+5\)**
*   **Buggy Reasoning:** This student likely suffers from a **misunderstanding of the BIDMAS acronym structure**. In the word "BIDMAS," the 'A' (Addition) comes before the 'S' (Subtraction). Therefore, they believe they must *always* add before they subtract, even if the subtraction is further left. For Problem Q, they remain tethered to the "Left-to-Right" instinct, ignoring the 'M' (Multiplication) priority.
*   **Attractiveness:** **Low/Moderate.** It is a confusing hybrid error. Most students who know enough to try and add first in Problem P would also know to multiply first in Problem Q. This option represents a student who is inconsistently applying rules.

#### **Option D: Problem P: \(5+6\); Problem Q: \(5 \times 6\)**
*   **Buggy Reasoning:** This is the **"Literal BIDMAS" error.** This student correctly identifies that multiplication takes priority over addition (Problem Q), but they incorrectly believe that addition *must* take priority over subtraction (Problem P). They do not realise that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be solved left-to-right.
*   **Attractiveness:** **High (for intermediate students).** This is a very common plateau in the UK curriculum. Teachers often teach the acronym without emphasizing that DM and AS are "tied" pairs. Students "over-correct" their left-to-right instinct and mistakenly prioritize addition.

### 2. Analysis of the Correct Answer (B)
*   **Correct Logic:** In Problem P, Addition and Subtraction are equal priority, so we move left-to-right ($4-5$). In Problem Q, Multiplication takes precedence over addition ($5 \times 6$).

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

This distribution reflects typical UK classrooms across Key Stage 3 (ages 11-14).

*   **Below Basic:** These students generally read left-to-right. They have heard of BIDMAS but don't know how to apply it.
*   **Basic:** They know "Multiplication comes first" (correcting Problem Q), but they follow the acronym literally (making the error in Problem P).
*   **Proficient:** Most will get it right, but some still fall for the "Addition before Subtraction" trap.
*   **Advanced:** These students understand the "Equal Priority" rule.

| Group | A (L-to-R) | B (Correct) | C (Hybrid) | D (Literal Acronym) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Below Basic** | 60% | 15% | 10% | 15% |
| **Basic** | 25% | 30% | 5% | 40% |
| **Proficient** | 10% | 65% | 5% | 20% |
| **Advanced** | 2% | 95% | 1% | 2% |

### Teacher's Summary
The battle in this question is between the **Left-to-Right instinct (Option A)** and the **Literal Acronym interpretation (Option D)**. Option A is the dominant error for weaker students, while Option D is actually more common in "middle-ability" students who are trying to follow the rules they've been taught but lack the nuance of equal priority.
