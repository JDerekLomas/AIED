Hello. As a specialist in error analysis, I’ve broken down the cognitive hurdles presented in this expansion problem. This question specifically targets the arithmetic within algebra, which is often where the "wheels fall off" for students who otherwise understand the FOIL/Grid method.

Here is my diagnostic breakdown:

### 1. Analysis of Wrong Answer Options

*   **Option B: -4 (The "Negatives Stay Negative" Misconception)**
    *   **Buggy Reasoning:** As specified, the student correctly identifies that $1 \times 4 = 4$, but their mental rule for directed numbers is flawed. They likely believe that "if there is a negative in the question, the answer must be negative," or they are confusing the rule for **adding** two negatives (which stays negative) with **multiplying** them.
*   **Option C: +5 (The "Operation Confusion" Error)**
    *   **Buggy Reasoning:** The student sees the numbers 1 and 4 and, instead of multiplying as required by the expansion of brackets, they **add** them. Because they see two negative signs, they might think "two negatives make a plus," leading them to do $(-1) + (-4)$ and then incorrectly changing the sign, or more likely, they simply ignore the signs and calculate $1 + 4 = 5$.
*   **Option D: -5 (The "Additives" Error)**
    *   **Buggy Reasoning:** This is a combination of two errors. First, the student performs **addition** instead of multiplication ($1 + 4$). Second, they correctly apply the rule for adding signed numbers: $(-1) + (-4) = -5$. Students who choose this often treat the expansion as "combining" the terms rather than find the product.

### 2. Attractiveness of Distractors

*   **Option B (-4): Highly Attractive.** This is the "classic" sign error. It feels correct to a student because the "4" matches their multiplication table knowledge, and they haven't yet mastered the parity of signs. It is most prevalent in mid-to-low ability students who are just starting to automate algebraic processes.
*   **Option C (+5): Moderately Attractive.** This appeals to students who have "over-learned" that two negatives make a positive but are fundamentally confused about the operation (multiplication vs. addition). This is common among students with weak "Number Sense" who revert to adding any numbers they see in a bracket.
*   **Option D (-5): Low-to-Moderate Attractiveness.** While it reflects a correct understanding of adding negatives, it is less attractive than B because it requires a double error (adding instead of multiplying AND keeping the sign). However, for students struggling with the very concept of "expanding," it is a frequent pitfall.

### 3. Predicted Response Distribution

| Level | A (+4) | B (-4) | C (+5) | D (-5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below Basic** | 20% | 40% | 20% | 20% |
| **Basic** | 45% | 35% | 10% | 10% |
| **Proficient** | 80% | 15% | 3% | 2% |
| **Advanced** | 98% | 1% | 1% | 0% |

**Summary of Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Struggling with both the operation (adding vs. multiplying) and sign rules.
*   **Basic:** Knows to multiply, but consistently trips over the $- \times - = +$ rule.
*   **Proficient:** Understands the rule but might make a "slip" under exam pressure (the 15% in Option B).
*   **Advanced:** Usually identifies the "trap" immediately and executes the calculation accurately.
