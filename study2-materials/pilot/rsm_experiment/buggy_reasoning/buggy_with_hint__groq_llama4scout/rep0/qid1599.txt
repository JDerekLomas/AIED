## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which is actually the correct answer. This option does not represent a misconception but rather the correct application of algebraic convention for the given expression \( c \div(h+4) \).

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \). This could result from a student mistakenly thinking that the division applies to both \(c\) and \(4\), or incorrectly adding \(4\) to \(c\) before dividing by \(h+4\). This error seems plausible as it involves a common mistake of misinterpreting the order of operations.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \). This option is generated by carrying out operations from left to right regardless of priority order, which matches the given misconception. A student with this misconception would incorrectly perform the division before considering the addition inside the parentheses.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D is \( \frac{h+4}{c} \). This could result from a student confusing the order of the operands or misinterpreting the division operation, possibly thinking it implies \( (h+4) \div c \) instead of \( c \div (h+4) \). This error indicates a misunderstanding of how division and operands are arranged in algebraic expressions.

## 5: Evaluating Attractiveness of Each Misconception
- Option B: This error might seem reasonable to students who are not fully comfortable with algebraic notation, as it involves a simplistic addition within the numerator. It's moderately attractive as it reflects a common struggle with parsing expressions.
- Option C: Carrying out operations from left to right without regard for priority is a very common and intuitive mistake for students who are still developing their understanding of operational order. This makes it highly attractive.
- Option D: This error is less about a gradual misconception and more about a direct misinterpretation of the expression. It might appeal to students who are very confused about the basic syntax of algebraic expressions.

## 6: Predicting Response Distribution
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: Students here might struggle significantly. Option C (left to right) seems particularly appealing due to its simplicity and intuitive nature. Option B might also attract due to addition being a familiar operation. A=20%, B=30%, C=40%, D=10%
- **Basic**: Students at this level should have some understanding of algebraic conventions but might still struggle. Option A should become more appealing as they learn correct conventions. A=40%, B=25%, C=25%, D=10%
- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to understand and apply algebraic conventions correctly. A=70%, B=15%, C=10%, D=5%
- **Advanced**: Students here are expected to have a strong grasp of algebraic expressions and conventions. A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
