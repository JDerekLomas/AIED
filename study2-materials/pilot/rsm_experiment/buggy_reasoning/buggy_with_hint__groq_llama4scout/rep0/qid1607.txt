## Step 1: Analyzing the given equation and Isaac's steps
The equation given is \( 15=\frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \( k \), the first step should involve multiplying both sides by 4 to isolate \( 1+k \), which would give \( 60 = 1 + k \). This matches Isaac's Step 1, indicating that Step 1 is correct.

## 2: Evaluating Isaac's Step 2
Isaac's Step 2 is \( 61 = k \). This is obtained by adding 1 to both sides of the equation \( 60 = 1 + k \), which is the correct operation to solve for \( k \). So, Step 2 is also correct.

## 3: Identifying the misconception for each wrong answer option
- Option A (Only step 1) would be chosen by a student who incorrectly thinks Step 2 is wrong, possibly due to not understanding that subtracting 1 from both sides of \( 60 = 1 + k \) yields \( k \).
- Option B (Only step 2) would be chosen by a student applying the misconception "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse," which in this context could mean not recognizing that to isolate \( k \), one must subtract 1 from both sides after multiplying by 4.
- Option C (Both steps are correct) seems correct based on the analysis.
- Option D (Both steps are incorrect) would be chosen by a student who fundamentally misunderstands algebraic manipulation.

## 4: Analyzing the buggy reasoning for each option
- For Option A, the error might be in not completing the solution or misunderstanding the goal of Step 2.
- For Option B, the known misconception applies directly: the student might have added 1 to both sides in Step 1 (which is correct) but then failed to recognize the correct next step as subtracting 1, not adding.
- For Option D, this would involve a significant misunderstanding of basic algebraic operations.

## 5: Judging the attractiveness of each error
- Option A might seem plausible if a student stops prematurely.
- Option B is directly related to a common misconception about inverse operations.
- Option D suggests a deeper misunderstanding of algebra.

## 6: Predicting the response distribution
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (premature conclusion), B=30% (misconception about operations), C=10% (not understanding basic steps), D=40% (significant confusion).
- **Basic:** A=10% (some understanding but incomplete), B=20% (common misconception), C=60% (understands basic algebra), D=10% (rare but possible confusion).
- **Proficient:** A=5% ( minor lapses), B=10% (occasional misconception), C=80% (strong understanding), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Advanced:** A=0% ( strong foundation), B=0% (unlikely misconception), C=90% (expects correct understanding), D=10% (perhaps overthinking).

The best answer is C.
