## Step 1: Analyzing Option C
Option C: \( \frac{99}{40} \) is given to result from the misconception "When adding fractions, add the numerators and denominators." To see how this applies, let's first convert the given mixed numbers into improper fractions: \( 2 \frac{7}{10} = \frac{27}{10} \) and \( 2 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \). The correct approach involves finding a common denominator and then adding. However, to evaluate Option C, we apply the misconception: \( \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} \) becomes \( \frac{27+9}{10+4} = \frac{36}{14} = \frac{18}{7} \), which does not match Option C. Let's correctly assess Option C with a likely mistake related to the question: If a student mistakenly added \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) for the whole numbers and then added \( \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} \) by finding a common denominator (40), they get \( \frac{28}{40} + \frac{10}{40} = \frac{38}{40} \) or \( \frac{19}{20} \), leading to \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \), not \( \frac{99}{40} \). The actual calculation for \( \frac{99}{40} \) seems unrelated to simple addition mistakes.

## 2: Correctly Identifying the Misconception for Option C
Given \( 2 \frac{7}{10} = \frac{27}{10} \) and \( 2 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \), to get \( \frac{99}{40} \), let's see if there's a plausible mistake: Converting to have a common denominator (40), \( \frac{27}{10} = \frac{108}{40} \) and \( \frac{9}{4} = \frac{90}{40} \). Adding these gives \( \frac{108}{40} + \frac{90}{40} = \frac{198}{40} = \frac{99}{20} \). A possible misstep leading to \( \frac{99}{40} \) could involve incorrect handling of fractions or decimals but let's assess other options.

## 3: Analyzing Option A
Option A: \( \frac{99}{20} \). This seems to come from correctly adding the fractions with a common denominator: \( 2 \frac{7}{10} + 2 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{54}{20} + \frac{45}{20} = \frac{99}{20} \). No misconception here, just correct calculation.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D: \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \). Let's see if adding the mixed numbers directly leads to this: \( 2 \frac{7}{10} + 2 \frac{1}{4} \). Adding the whole numbers: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \). For fractions, finding a common denominator (20), \( \frac{7}{10} = \frac{14}{20} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{20} \), so \( \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20} \), leading to \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \), not \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \). A likely mistake for \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \) is adding the fractions \( \frac{7}{10} + \frac{1}{4} \) by first getting a common denominator (20) which yields \( \frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20} \) or simplifying \( \frac{19}{20} \) to \( \frac{8}{14} \) by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2.5 (though this last step seems incorrect as \( \frac{19}{20} \) does not simplify to \( \frac{8}{14} \)).

## 5: Evaluating the Misconception for Each Option
- Option C (\( \frac{99}{40} \)): This doesn't directly follow from simple addition or the given misconception. Correct calculation yields \( \frac{99}{20} \) or \( 4 \frac{19}{20} \), suggesting \( \frac{99}{40} \) might result from an error in handling the fractions or converting between mixed numbers and improper fractions.
- Option D (\( 4 \frac{8}{14} \)): A plausible mistake involves incorrectly adding or reducing fractions.

## 6: Judging Attractiveness of Each Error
- Option A is correct, so 0% for any error category.
- Option C's error seems less straightforward and might result from confusion or miscalculation.
- Option D seems to result from a simplification error.

## 7: Predicting Response Distribution
Given the question and analysis:
- **Below Basic**: Might struggle with basic conversions and additions. Option C could appeal due to misconceptions. A=10%, B=20%, C=40%, D=30%.
- **Basic**: Understands basic operations but might make calculation errors. A=30%, B=40%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Accurately converts and adds. A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Highly accurate with complex operations. A=0%, B=95%, C=0%, D=5%.

The best answer is B.
