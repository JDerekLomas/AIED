## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( m^{2}-2 m-35 \). To achieve this, a student might incorrectly apply the distributive property or FOIL method. The correct expansion using FOIL is \( m \cdot m + m \cdot (-7) - 5 \cdot m - 5 \cdot (-7) \), which simplifies to \( m^{2} - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^{2} - 12m + 35 \). A student getting Option A might have done \( m^{2} - 7m - 5m - 35 \) (incorrectly adding the constants or misapplying signs), suggesting a confusion in combining like terms or applying the signs correctly.

## 2: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( m^{2}+12 m+35 \). This could result from a student incorrectly adding the terms: \( m^{2} + 7m + 5m + 35 \), which would imply they forgot to account for the negative signs properly or mistakenly added the coefficients of \( m \) instead of subtracting them. This error seems plausible if a student is not careful with the signs during the FOIL process.

## 3: Analyzing Option D with Known Misconception
Option D is \( m^{2}-12 m-35 \). Given the known misconception that "multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer," let's see if this applies. The correct multiplication is \( (m - 5)(m - 7) = m^{2} - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^{2} - 12m + 35 \). If a student believed multiplying two negatives gave a negative, they might incorrectly calculate \( -5 \cdot -7 \) as \( -35 \) instead of \( +35 \), leading to \( m^{2} - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^{2} - 12m - 35 \). This directly relates to the misconception provided.

## 4: Judging Attractiveness of Each Error
- Option A (\( m^{2}-2 m-35 \)) seems less likely as it requires a specific mistake in combining terms that doesn't directly relate to a common misconception like sign errors or distribution mistakes.
- Option C (\( m^{2}+12 m+35 \)) could be attractive if students are not meticulous about signs.
- Option D (\( m^{2}-12 m-35 \)) directly results from a specific misconception about negative number multiplication, making it a clear and attractive error for those holding that misconception.

## 5: Predicting Response Distribution
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: Students here might struggle significantly. Option D could appeal due to the misconception (20%), Option A due to simple arithmetic mistakes (25%), Option C from not handling signs properly (20%), and Option B, being correct, might be less chosen (35%).
- **Basic**: Students might still fall into these traps but with less frequency. Option B should increase as understanding improves (50%), with Options A, C, and D decreasing (15%, 15%, 20%).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts but might still make careless errors. Thus, Option B should be high (80%), with small percentages for A, C, and D (5%, 5%, 10%).
- **Advanced**: This group is highly unlikely to choose incorrect options. Option B should be nearly 100%, with negligible percentages for others (0%, 0%, 0%).

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Based on typical student performance and error patterns:
- **Below Basic**: A=25%, B=30%, C=20%, D=25%
- **Basic**: A=15%, B=55%, C=15%, D=15%
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=98%, C=1%, D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=55% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
