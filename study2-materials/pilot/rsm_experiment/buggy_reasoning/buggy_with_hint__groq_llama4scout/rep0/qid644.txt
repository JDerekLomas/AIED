## Step 1: Understand the task and the question
The task is to analyze wrong answer options for a maths question, identify the misconceptions leading to each wrong option, assess how attractive (easy to fall into) each misconception is, and predict the response distribution across different ability levels.

## 2: Identify the correct answer
To multiply the terms indicated by the arrows, \( -1 \times -4 = 4 \). So, the correct answer is \( +4 \) or option A.

## 3: Analyze option B
Option B is \( -4 \). The known misconception for option B is "Believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer". When multiplying two negative numbers, \( -1 \times -4 \), a student with this misconception would indeed get \( -4 \), because they incorrectly believe that multiplying two negatives yields a negative.

## 4: Assess the attractiveness of option B's misconception
This misconception can be quite persistent and attractive, especially for students who are not fully secure with the rules of signs in multiplication. It's a fundamental concept that if not properly understood, can lead to repeated errors. Students might not notice they went wrong if they are not checking their work against the rules of arithmetic.

## 5: Analyze option C
Option C is \( +5 \). There isn't a straightforward mathematical operation or common misconception that leads directly to \( +5 \) from \( -1 \times -4 \). This might result from a random guess or an incorrect attempt to apply a different mathematical operation or rule.

## 6: Assess the attractiveness of option C's error
Option C seems less likely to be chosen based on a specific misconception and might be considered a random guess. It's less attractive as it doesn't stem from a common mathematical misconception.

## 7: Analyze option D
Option D is \( -5 \). This could result from a misconception or mistake similar to option B but with an additional error, possibly subtracting 1 from the product (thinking \( -1 \times -4 = 4 - 1 = 3 \) and then making another mistake to get \( -5 \)), or simply adding or subtracting incorrectly.

## 8: Assess the attractiveness of option D's error
Option D seems less directly related to a common misconception about signs and more likely to result from a calculation error. It's somewhat attractive because it could result from a miscalculation or incorrect application of operations.

## 9: Predict the response distribution
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: Might struggle with fundamental concepts, so option B (misconception about negatives) could be high. Let's predict: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%.
- **Basic**: Understanding of basics but might still hold some misconceptions. Option B could still be tempting: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%.
- **Proficient**: Secure with basics, less likely to fall for misconceptions: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Very secure, unlikely to make simple errors: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%.

The best answer is A.
