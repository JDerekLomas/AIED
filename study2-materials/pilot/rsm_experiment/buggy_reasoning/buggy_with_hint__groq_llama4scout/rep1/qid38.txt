## Step 1: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( \frac{7}{3 x} \). The known misconception for Option B is "When adding fractions, add the numerators and denominators." Applying this to the given problem: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \) would mistakenly become \( \frac{3+4}{2x+x} = \frac{7}{3x} \). This error is quite straightforward and might seem reasonable to students who don't fully understand the rules for adding fractions.

## 2: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( \frac{11}{x} \). This could result from a student adding the numerators (\(3 + 4 = 7\)) but not adjusting the denominator properly, or simply adding the numerators and using \(x\) as a common denominator without considering \(2x\). A possible mistaken step could be: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \) is the correct step, but if a student mistakenly thought \( \frac{4}{x} \) was \( \frac{4}{2x} \) or just added numerators without finding a common denominator, they might get \( \frac{7}{x} \) or directly \( \frac{11}{x} \) if they incorrectly adjusted. However, a direct and simple error leading to \( \frac{11}{x} \) would involve incorrectly finding a common denominator or misunderstanding fraction addition.

## 3: Analyzing Option A and D
Option A is \( \frac{11}{2x} \) and Option D is \( \frac{7}{2x} \). The correct answer is actually \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \). Option D, \( \frac{7}{2x} \), could result from an incorrect addition of numerators (\(3 + 4 = 7\)), but with the correct common denominator \(2x\).

## 4: Identifying Misconceptions and Attractiveness
- **Option B (\( \frac{7}{3x} \))**: The misconception of adding numerators and denominators is relatively common and attractive because it seems like a simple, logical step for students who haven't mastered fraction addition.
- **Option C (\( \frac{11}{x} \))**: This might result from not finding a common denominator correctly or adding fractions without properly adjusting. It's less straightforward than Option B but still plausible for students struggling with common denominators.
- **Option D (\( \frac{7}{2x} \))**: This could come from correctly identifying the common denominator but incorrectly adding the numerators or misunderstanding the fractions. It's a bit more nuanced and might be chosen by students who are close to understanding but make a calculation error.

## 5: Predicting Response Distribution
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: Might struggle significantly, leading to a higher chance of selecting obviously incorrect options like B and C due to a lack of understanding. A=20%, B=40%, C=30%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students here might start to understand common denominators but still make errors. A=30%, B=35%, C=20%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand fraction addition and are less likely to fall into simple traps. A=60%, B=10%, C=5%, D=25%.
- **Advanced**: These students are very comfortable with the material and unlikely to make simple errors. A=80%, B=5%, C=0%, D=15%.

The best answer is A.
