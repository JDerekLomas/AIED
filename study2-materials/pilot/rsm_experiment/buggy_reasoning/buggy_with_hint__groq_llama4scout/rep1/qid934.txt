## Step 1: Analyze the equation and the table of values
The given equation is \(4x + 2y = 10\). We need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\), which is represented by \(\color{gold}\bigstar\) in the table.

## 2: Solve for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
To find \(y\) when \(x = 0\), substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation:
\(4(0) + 2y = 10\)
\(0 + 2y = 10\)
\(2y = 10\)
\(y = 5\)

## 3: Identify the correct answer
The correct value to replace the star is \(5\), which corresponds to option C.

## 4: Analyze option A: \(20\)
Option A is \(20\). A student who uses the same operation rather than the inverse might think:
- Given \(4x + 2y = 10\), to isolate \(y\), they might try to get rid of \(4x\) by adding \(4x\) to both sides instead of subtracting, but more directly, they might incorrectly apply operations:
\(4(0) + 2y = 10\)
Instead of solving for \(y\) correctly, they might do:
\(2y = 10 + 4(0)\) which is correct but then think "I need to get \(y\) by itself, so I'll multiply by \(4\)" (which is incorrect and relates to using the operation \(4\) on both sides unnecessarily):
\(2y \times 4 = 10 \times 4\)
\(8y = 40\)
\(y = 5\), but another erroneous path could be adding \(4x\) (which is \(0\)) and then incorrectly trying to solve:
This path seems a bit forced; a more likely mistake would directly relate to misinterpretation of operations.

## 5: Analyze option B: \(3\)
For option B, \(3\), a possible mistake could be:
- Setting \(x = 1\) and solving for \(y\) to get a "feel" for \(y\), then assuming a linear decrease or incorrect substitution:
Given \(4x + 2y = 10\), if \(x = 1\):
\(4(1) + 2y = 10\)
\(4 + 2y = 10\)
\(2y = 6\)
\(y = 3\) for \(x = 1\), then assuming \(y = 3\) for \(x = 0\) as well, because they might mistakenly think \(y\) doesn't change with \(x\) or made a calculation error.

## 6: Analyze option D: \(2.5\)
For option D, \(2.5\), a student might:
- Incorrectly substitute or solve the equation:
They might forget to multiply or divide correctly, for instance:
\(4(0) = 0\), so \(2y = 10\), but then they divide \(10\) by \(4\) instead of \(2\):
\(y = 10 / 4 = 2.5\)

## 7: Assess Attractiveness of Errors
- Option A (\(20\)): This seems less likely because it requires a specific mistaken step that isn't as straightforward or commonly mistaken.
- Option B (\(3\)): Attractive because it might result from misinterpreting how \(x\) and \(y\) relate or a calculation mistake with another \(x\) value.
- Option D (\(2.5\)): Quite attractive because it's a simple division mistake.

## 8: Predict Response Distribution
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: Likely to see more errors, especially straightforward ones like D (\(2.5\)) and potentially B (\(3\)), less so A (\(20\)).
- **Basic**: Might still struggle, but understand relationships better, so fewer Bs and more correct answers or logical mistakes.
- **Proficient**: Should mostly choose C (\(5\)), with some potential for D (\(2.5\)) due to careless mistakes.
- **Advanced**: Unlikely to choose incorrect options.

## 9: Estimate Percentages
Assuming typical error rates and understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=10%, B=20%, C=40%, D=30%
- **Basic**: A=5%, B=15%, C=60%, D=20%
- **Proficient**: A=2%, B=5%, C=80%, D=13%
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%

The best answer is C.
