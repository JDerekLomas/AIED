## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \). This option correctly calculates the sum of the given numbers (excluding 0) and then divides by the count of numbers used in the sum. The correct calculation for the mean should include 0 in the sum. The misconception here seems to be the exclusion of 0 from the sum, which could be due to a student thinking that 0 does not contribute to the sum or accidentally overlooking it.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \). This option reflects the misconception that operations should be carried out from left to right regardless of priority order. A student with this misconception would evaluate the expression as \( (0+1+3+4+7) \div 5 \) is not what they do; instead, they do \( 0+1+3+4 = 8 \), then \( 7 \div 5 = 1.4 \), and finally \( 8 + 1.4 = 9.4 \). This clearly does not represent a standard mathematical operation priority error but illustrates a left-to-right operation without regard for operator precedence.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \). This suggests a student mistakenly counted the numbers, excluding 0, which results in dividing by 4 instead of 5. This error involves miscounting the data points.

## 4: Attractiveness of Each Error
- Option A: This seems like a reasonable mistake, especially if a student is hasty or not paying close attention to all numbers provided. It's relatively easy to overlook the 0. **Attractiveness: 6/10**
- Option B: Carrying out operations from left to right without considering priority is a common misconception, especially among younger students or those with less experience. **Attractiveness: 8/10**
- Option C: Miscounting data points is a straightforward error that can happen to anyone, especially under time pressure or if not carefully reading the question. **Attractiveness: 7/10**

## 5: Predicting Response Distribution
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below Basic:** Students here might struggle with basic operations and are more likely to make straightforward errors. Option B (left to right) might be appealing due to a lack of understanding of operation precedence. Option A and C are plausible due to simple oversight or miscounting. **A=20%, B=30%, C=25%, D=25%**
- **Basic:** Students at this level understand basic math operations but might still make careless mistakes. They're less likely to fall for B but might still choose A or C due to oversight. **A=40%, B=15%, C=30%, D=15%**
- **Proficient:** These students are more likely to understand the correct procedure and are less likely to make basic errors like B or C. **A=70%, B=5%, C=10%, D=15%**
- **Advanced:** Students here are highly unlikely to make such basic errors. **A=90%, B=0%, C=0%, D=10%**

The best answer is D.
