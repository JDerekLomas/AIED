## Step 1: Understand the task and the equation given
The equation given is \(4x + 2y = 10\), and we need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\). The table of values provided is:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline\( x \) & \( 0 \) & \( 1 \) & \( 2 \) & \( 3 \) & \( 4 \) \\
\hline\( y \) & \( \color{gold}\bigstar \) &   
\end{tabular}
To find \(y\) when \(x = 0\), we substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\).

## 2: Solve for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation gives \(4(0) + 2y = 10\), which simplifies to \(2y = 10\). Solving for \(y\) gives \(y = 5\).

## 3: Analyze option A using the known misconception
Option A is \(20\). The misconception here is "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse". If a student was to mistakenly add \(4x\) to both sides instead of subtracting, they'd still be incorrect, but let's see how it applies: If \(x = 0\), \(4*0 + 2y = 10\) becomes \(2y = 10\), and solving it correctly yields \(y = 5\). If a student mistakenly thought to "get rid" of \(4x\) by adding \(4x\) to both sides (which doesn't make sense in this context since \(4x = 0\)), they wouldn't get \(20\). However, if they simply ignored \(4x\) and solved \(2y = 10\) but then did something like \(y = 10 * 2\) (which is incorrect), they might get \(20\). The actual mistake here seems to be a simple algebraic error rather than the described misconception.

## 4: Analyze option B (\(3\))
To get \(y = 3\), a student might substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation and get \(2y = 10\), which correctly yields \(y = 5\). However, if they mistakenly solved \(4*0 + 2y = 10\) as \(2y = 5\) (dividing \(10\) by \(2\) but then not solving for \(y\) correctly), they might get \(y = 2.5\) or simply make a calculation error. For \(y = 3\), one might think of an error like \(4*0 + y = 10\), leading to \(y = 10\), which doesn't match. The error here seems to be a miscalculation or incorrect substitution.

## 5: Analyze option D (\(2.5\))
For \(y = 2.5\), if a student substituted \(x = 0\) into \(4x + 2y = 10\), getting \(2y = 10\), and then divided by \(4\) instead of \(2\) (a clear miscalculation), they'd get \(y = 10 / 4 = 2.5\). This indicates a possible mistake where a student divides by \(4\) (the coefficient of \(x\)) instead of \(2\) (the coefficient of \(y\)).

## 6: Judging the attractiveness of each error and predicting response distribution
- **Option A (\(20\)):**
  - Misconception: Incorrect operation or misunderstanding of equation solving.
  - Attractiveness: Low, as it requires a significant miscalculation or misunderstanding.
- **Option B (\(3\)):**
  - Error: Miscalculation or incorrect algebraic step.
  - Attractiveness: Moderate, as students might easily miscalculate or omit steps.
- **Option D (\(2.5\)):**
  - Error: Dividing by wrong coefficient.
  - Attractiveness: High, especially for lower-ability students who might get confused with coefficients.

## 7: Predicting Response Distribution
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=10% (significant mistake), B=20% (simple error), C=60% (correct), D=10% (coefficient mix-up).
- **Basic:** A=5% (less likely), B=30% (common errors), C=55% (correct), D=10% (occasional mistake).
- **Proficient:** A=2% (rare), B=10% (occasional slip), C=85% (correct), D=3% (unlikely).
- **Advanced:** A=1% (very rare), B=5% (rare), C=90% (correct), D=4% (uncommon).

The best answer is C.
