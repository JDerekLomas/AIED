## Step 1: Analyze Option A
Option A is $0.81$. The misconception here is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order". For the equation $y=3 x^{2}$ and $x=0.3$, a student with this misconception might calculate $y$ as $3 \times 0.3^{2}$ but then incorrectly compute it as $3 \times 0.3 \times 2$ or simply $3 \times 0.3 \times 0.3$ but then do $0.3 \times 3 = 0.9$ then $0.9 \times 0.3 = 0.27$. However, let's correct that: if they do $0.3^2 = 0.09$ then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. The actual calculation should be $y = 3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. So, a student might mistakenly calculate this as simply $0.3 \times 3 = 0.9$ and then try to adjust, but actually, to get $0.81$, they'd have to be doing $0.9^2$ or another incorrect operation. The $0.81$ seems to come from $0.9^2$ or a very similar miscalculation. This seems less directly related to left-to-right operation without priority.

## 2: Identify Misconception for Option A
The calculation for $y=3x^2$ when $x=0.3$ should be $y=3(0.3)^2 = 3*0.09 = 0.27$. For a student to choose $0.81$ (Option A) due to the misconception of carrying out operations from left to right, they might incorrectly think $y = 3*0.3^2$ should be done as $(3*0.3)^2 = (0.9)^2 = 0.81$. This matches the left-to-right misconception quite well.

## 3: Analyze Option B
Option B is $0.27$. This is actually the correct answer: $y = 3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. No misconception here.

## 4: Analyze Option C
Option C is $1.8$. A possible misconception here could be that a student simply multiplies $3 \times 0.3$ without squaring $0.3$, resulting in $0.9$ or directly calculates $3 \times 0.6$ (though where $0.6$ comes from is unclear). However, a straightforward error would be $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then mistakenly adding or multiplying by another factor. But directly, $3*0.6=1.8$, suggesting a mistake like using $x=0.6$ instead of $x=0.3$ or $0.3^2=0.06$ then $3*0.6=1.8$.

## 5: Analyze Option D
Option D is $2.7$. This could result from a misconception where a student calculates $3 \times 0.3^2$ as $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$, mistakenly using $0.9$ instead of $0.09$.

## 6: Attractiveness and Error Likelihood
- **Option A ($0.81$)**: This seems reasonably attractive because it involves a common type of mistake where order of operations is misunderstood, leading to $(3*0.3)^2$.
- **Option C ($1.8$)**: This might seem attractive to students who misunderstand the equation or incorrectly substitute values.
- **Option D ($2.7$)**: This could be attractive if students mistakenly use larger numbers or miscalculate the square.

## 7: Predict Response Distribution
The distribution depends on student ability:
- **Below Basic**: More likely to choose A, C, or D due to basic operational errors. A ($20\%$), B ($40\%$), C ($20\%$), D ($20\%$).
- **Basic**: Might still struggle, but more towards correct or simple miscalculations. A ($10\%$), B ($60\%$), C ($15\%$), D ($15\%$).
- **Proficient**: Should mostly get it right, but some might fall into minor errors. A ($5\%$), B ($80\%$), C ($5\%$), D ($10\%$).
- **Advanced**: Highly unlikely to make these errors. A ($1\%$), B ($95\%$), C ($2\%$), D ($2\%$).

The best answer is B.
