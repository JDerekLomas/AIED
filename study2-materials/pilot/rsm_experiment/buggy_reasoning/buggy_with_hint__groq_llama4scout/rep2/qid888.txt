## Step 1: Analyze Option A
Option A is \( m^{2}-2 m-35 \). To achieve this, a student might mistakenly apply the formula \((a-b)(c-d) = ac - ad - bc + bd\) but incorrectly simplify or forget to distribute properly, leading to \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35\) doesn't match, but if they forgot to add the \(+bd\) part or misinterpreted it, they could get \(m^2 - 5m - 7m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\) doesn't match. Actually, to get \(m^2 - 2m - 35\), one would incorrectly do \((m-5)(m-7) = m(m) - 5(-7) = m^2 + 35 - 5m - 7m\) which doesn't align well. A more likely mistake for A would involve miscalculating or misapplying the distributive property in a way that isn't immediately obvious.

## 2: Analyze Option C
Option C is \( m^{2}+12 m+35 \). This seems to come from mistakenly adding the terms inside the brackets instead of multiplying them out properly: \((m-5)(m-7) = m^2 - 5m - 7m - 35\), and then incorrectly getting \(m^2 + 12m + 35\) could result from \(-5m - 7m = 12m\) (which doesn't make sense) or simply mistakenly putting a \(+\) between \(m^2\) and \(12m\). This could actually result from a confusion where a student incorrectly applies \((a+b)(c+d) = ac + ad + bc + bd\), thinking both are positive or mistakenly adding.

## 3: Analyze Option D
Option D, \( m^{2}-12 m-35 \), is based on the misconception that multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer. The correct expansion is \((m-5)(m-7) = m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\). For a student to choose D, they would do \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35 = m^2 - 12m - 35\), essentially treating \((-5) \times (-7) = -35\) instead of \(+35\), reflecting the known misconception.

## 4: Attractiveness of Errors
- Option A (\( m^{2}-2 m-35 \)) seems less straightforward and may come from partial distribution or misapplication of rules not immediately recognizable.
- Option C (\( m^{2}+12 m+35 \)) seems like an error of addition instead of multiplication or incorrect handling of negative signs, quite plausible.
- Option D (\( m^{2}-12 m-35 \)) directly correlates with a specific misconception about negative \(\times\) negative.

## 5: Judging Attractiveness
- The error in D feels "reasonable" if a student holds the misconception about negatives. 
- The mistake for C seems "natural" if one mistakenly handles operations or signs.
- A seems less likely without specific missteps hard to generalize.

## 6: Predicting Response Distribution
Given typical student errors and assuming:
- **Below Basic**: May struggle significantly, more likely to pick A or C due to confusion (\(A=30\%, B=20\%, C=30\%, D=20\%\))
- **Basic**: Starting to understand, less likely to pick C or A, more B (\(A=15\%, B=50\%, C=20\%, D=15\%\))
- **Proficient**: Understands concepts, A and C less likely (\(A=5\%, B=85\%, C=5\%, D=5\%\))
- **Advanced**: Highly unlikely to make basic errors (\(A=0\%, B=95\%, C=0\%, D=5\%\))

The best answer is B.
