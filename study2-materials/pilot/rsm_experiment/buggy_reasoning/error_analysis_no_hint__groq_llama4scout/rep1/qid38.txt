## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors
The question asks to simplify the expression \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} \) into a single fraction. The correct approach is to find a common denominator, which is \(2x\), and then add the fractions: \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \).

## 2: Identify potential errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error is to add the numerators and denominators directly without finding a common denominator, leading to \( \frac{3+4}{2x+x} = \frac{7}{3x} \) (Option B). This method feels natural but is incorrect.
- Another error could be to add the fractions without adjusting for the common denominator properly, resulting in \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x} \) (Option A), which is actually correct but let's see how students might misinterpret this.
- Some might incorrectly find a common denominator but then mishandle the addition, such as \( \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{3+4}{2x} = \frac{7}{2x} \) (Option D), which is a plausible mistake.
- A less likely but possible mistake is to not simplify or incorrectly simplify, leading to \( \frac{11}{x} \) (Option C) if they somehow incorrectly combined terms or forgot to simplify.

## 3: Analyze the errors by ability level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to make significant errors. They might not understand the concept of adding fractions with different denominators. A direct addition error leading to Option B (\( \frac{7}{3x} \)) seems plausible. They might also struggle to simplify, potentially leading to Option C (\( \frac{11}{x} \)) if they incorrectly combine terms or forget to find a common denominator.

## 4: Predict percentages for each option by ability level
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to choose B (\( \frac{7}{3x} \)) as it represents a straightforward but incorrect method of adding fractions without properly finding a common denominator. Option C (\( \frac{11}{x} \)) could also be appealing due to oversimplification. Let's predict: B=40%, C=30%, A=20%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still fall into traps. Option B (\( \frac{7}{3x} \)) remains attractive. Let's predict: B=30%, A=40%, D=20%, C=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the process but might make minor errors. Option D (\( \frac{7}{2x} \)) could be a mistake if they miscalculate the numerator. Let's predict: A=80%, D=10%, B=5%, C=5%.
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to get it correct. Let's predict: A=95%, D=3%, B=1%, C=1%.

## 5: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%
