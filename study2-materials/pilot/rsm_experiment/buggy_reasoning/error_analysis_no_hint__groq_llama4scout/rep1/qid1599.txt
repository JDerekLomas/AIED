To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls for students.

The question asks for the correct algebraic convention for \( c \div(h+4) \). The correct answer is A) \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), as division by a quantity is represented as a fraction.

## Step 1: Identify Common Errors
- Option B) \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \) suggests adding 4 to \( c \) before dividing, which might appeal to students who are not careful with the order of operations or mistakenly think the addition inside the parentheses directly affects \( c \).
- Option C) \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \) implies that the division and addition are separate operations not bound by the parentheses, which could be an attractive mistake for students who do not understand the grouping of operations correctly.
- Option D) \( \frac{h+4}{c} \) flips the numerator and denominator, suggesting a misunderstanding of division (or possibly a confusion with solving equations where \( c \) might be isolated).

## 2: Analyze Attractive Mistakes
- The most attractive mistake seems to be Option C) \( \frac{c}{h}+4 \) because it represents a natural, albeit incorrect, application of operations: divide \( c \) by \( h \) and then add 4. Students often struggle with applying the correct order of operations and might find this option appealing due to its seeming logical simplicity.
- Option B) \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \) might also be chosen by students who incorrectly assume the \( +4 \) applies to \( c \), showing a misunderstanding of how parentheses affect algebraic expressions.

## 3: Consider Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic conventions and could easily fall into traps. They might choose B, C, or D due to a lack of understanding of basic algebraic manipulations. Option C might be particularly appealing due to its straightforward appearance.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with nuances. They are less likely to choose D (as it involves a more significant misunderstanding) but might opt for B or C if they're not fully secure in their understanding of algebraic expressions.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should have a solid grasp of algebraic conventions. They are likely to choose A but might still make careless mistakes leading to B or C.
- **Advanced**: These students are expected to have a deep understanding and are likely to choose A with high accuracy, with minimal selection of incorrect options.

## 4: Estimate Percentages
Given the above considerations:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some understanding but might struggle), B=20% (mistaken addition), C=30% (attractive mistake), D=10% (significant misunderstanding).
- **Basic**: A=60% (better understanding), B=20% (common mistake), C=15% (some still fall into the trap), D=5% (less likely).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (strong understanding), B=10% (occasional mistake), C=5% (rare mistake), D=5% (unlikely but possible).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (very strong understanding), B=3% (rare error), C=1% (very rare), D=1% (extremely unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
