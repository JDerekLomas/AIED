To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential errors that could lead to each wrong answer.

The question asks for the product of the two terms indicated by the arrows in the expression \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## Step 1: Identify the correct answer and common errors.
The correct answer is \(+4\) (Option A). A common error would be forgetting the rule that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result. 

## 2: Analyze the calculation error for each wrong answer.
- Option B (\( -4 \)): This would result from \((-1) \times (-4) = -4\), which incorrectly applies the multiplication rule for negative numbers as if they were being subtracted or added.
- Option C (\( +5 \)): There's no direct mathematical operation that leads to \(+5\) from \((-1) \times (-4)\) without additional incorrect steps.
- Option D (\( -5 \)): Similarly, there's no straightforward error from the multiplication that leads directly to \(-5\).

## 3: Consider the "attractiveness" of each wrong answer.
- Option B (\( -4 \)) might seem attractive to students who forget that two negatives make a positive.
- Options C and D seem less directly related to common errors in multiplying \(-1\) and \(-4\).

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic multiplication and the rules for negative numbers. They might choose B (\( -4 \)) because they forget two negatives make a positive (around 40-50%), some might randomly pick other options, but A (\( +4 \)) would be less common because it requires understanding of negative number multiplication (A=20%, B=50%, C=15%, D=15%).
- **Basic**: These students understand basic operations but might make careless mistakes. They could choose B (\( -4 \)) due to oversight (around 20-30%), and more might get A correct (A=60%, B=30%, C=5%, D=5%).
- **Proficient**: Students here have a good grasp of operations. They are less likely to choose incorrect options based on simple errors (A=80%, B=15%, C=2%, D=3%).
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the operations but also are less prone to simple calculation errors. The vast majority would choose A (A=95%, B=4%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%).

## 5: Summarize Predictions.
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=50% C=15% D=15%
- **basic**: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=50% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%
