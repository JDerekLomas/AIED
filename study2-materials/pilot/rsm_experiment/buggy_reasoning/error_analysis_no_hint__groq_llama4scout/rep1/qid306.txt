To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's first analyze the problems and the common errors students might make.

## Step 1: Analyzing Problem P
Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \). According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we perform operations from left to right when addition and subtraction are the only operations involved. So, the correct order is to perform \( 4-5 \) first, then add 6. This means the correct calculation order is \( 4-5+6 \), which implies doing \( 4-5 \) first.

## 2: Analyzing Problem Q
Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). Following the order of operations, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, the correct calculation to do first is \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 3: Identifying Correct Answers
For Problem P, the correct first calculation is \( 4-5 \). For Problem Q, the correct first calculation is \( 5 \times 6 \). This matches option B: Problem P: \( 4-5 \), Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \).

## 4: Understanding Common Errors
- Students who are below basic might not understand the order of operations at all, potentially choosing options that seem to follow no logical sequence or choosing operations randomly.
- Basic students might understand the concept of performing operations from left to right for addition/subtraction but could struggle with mixed operations, potentially leading them to choose A or C.
- Proficient students should generally understand the order of operations correctly, choosing B.
- Advanced students are likely to not only choose B but also to have a strong understanding of why B is correct.

## 5: Predicting Student Choices
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to make random or intuitive guesses. Option A (P: \( 4-5 \), Q: \( 4+5 \)) and C (P: \( 5+6 \), Q: \( 4+5 \)) might seem attractive because they involve operations that are presented in the question, but without a clear understanding of order of operations, they might distribute their choices across A, C, and possibly D, with a slight inclination towards A because it correctly identifies one operation for P but not for Q. **A=30%, B=10%, C=30%, D=30%**
- **Basic**: Basic students might lean towards A because it seems to follow a left-to-right approach for both but incorrectly applies it to Q. They might also consider C because it suggests adding first in P, which doesn't apply. However, there's a good chance they'll choose B if they've grasped the basics of order of operations. **A=40%, B=30%, C=20%, D=10%**
- **Proficient**: These students should mostly choose B, as they understand the order of operations. There might be some confusion leading to A or less likely C or D, but B should be the predominant choice. **A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%**
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are expected to choose B without any issues. There's minimal chance of selecting wrong options due to their strong grasp of mathematical concepts. **A=0%, B=95%, C=2.5%, D=2.5%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2.5% D=2.5%
