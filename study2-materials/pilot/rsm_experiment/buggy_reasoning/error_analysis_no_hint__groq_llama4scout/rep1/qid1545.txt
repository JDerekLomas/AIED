## Step 1: Understand the question and the operations involved
The question requires students to compare two expressions: $8+12 \div 4$ and $(8+12) \div 4$. To solve this, students need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 2: Solve the expressions correctly
First, solve $8+12 \div 4$: Following BODMAS, $12 \div 4 = 3$, then $8 + 3 = 11$.
Next, solve $(8+12) \div 4$: Following BODMAS, $8+12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$.

## 3: Compare the results
Comparing the two results: $11 > 5$. Therefore, the correct symbol to use is $>$.

## 4: Identify potential calculation errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error is to ignore BODMAS and perform operations from left to right or incorrectly. For $8+12 \div 4$, some might calculate $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$. For $(8+12) \div 4$, they might do $8 \div 4 + 12 \div 4 = 2 + 3 = 5$. This leads to incorrect equality.
- Another error could be misunderstanding the distribution in the second expression, thinking $(8+12) \div 4 = 8 \div 4 + 12 \div 4 = 2 + 3 = 5$ and for the first expression getting $11$, leading to $>$.

## 5: Analyze the options based on common mistakes
- Option A ($>$) is correct based on correct calculation.
- Option B ($<$) would be chosen by those who incorrectly calculate both expressions to the same value or incorrectly assess their relationship.
- Option C ($=$) would be chosen by those who calculate both expressions to equal values, often due to incorrect application of BODMAS.
- Option D ($\geq$) would be less commonly chosen as it implies equality or greater than, which would not be selected unless a student thought the expressions could be equal or was unsure.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students might not follow BODMAS correctly, leading to errors like calculating $8+12 \div 4$ as $20 \div 4 = 5$ and $(8+12) \div 4$ as $5$, choosing C.
- **Basic**: Students might make calculation errors but still have a sense of the operations. They might choose B or C due to miscalculations.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to calculate correctly and choose A. Some might still fall into the trap of incorrect operations but are less likely to.
- **Advanced**: These students are highly likely to choose A, as they understand BODMAS and can accurately calculate.

## 7: Estimate percentages for each ability level
Given the above analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (those who somehow managed $>$), B=30% (those who thought $<$), C=40% (those who thought $=$ due to incorrect calculations), D=10% (those unsure or made other errors).
- **Basic**: A=40% (correct), B=25% (incorrect calculations leading to $<$), C=30% (incorrectly thought $=$), D=5% (unsure).
- **Proficient**: A=70% (correct), B=15% (some calculation errors), C=10% (occasional mistake), D=5% (uncommon).
- **Advanced**: A=90% (correct), B=5% (rare errors), C=4% (very rare mistakes), D=1% (extremely rare).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=4% D=1%
