## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question requires identifying the correct next line of working for the equation \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) as proposed by Tom and Katie, and determining who is correct between them.

## 2: Solving the equation to verify Tom's and Katie's suggestions
To verify Tom's suggestion: \( \frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12 \) becomes \( \frac{x}{3} = 12 + 5 = 17 \), which matches Tom's proposal. This is a correct step as it properly isolates \( \frac{x}{3} \) by adding 5 to both sides.

## 3: Evaluating Katie's suggestion
For Katie's suggestion: \( x - 5 = 36 \), let's see if it's a correct manipulation of the original equation. Multiplying every term in the original equation by 3 to clear the denominator yields \( x - 15 = 36 \), not \( x - 5 = 36 \). This indicates Katie's suggestion does not correctly derive from the original equation.

## 4: Identifying calculation errors and attractive wrong methods
- Tom's method is correct and straightforward.
- Katie's method seems to misunderstand the operation needed to clear the fraction. A common error could involve incorrectly multiplying the constant term by 3, leading to \( x - 5 = 36 \) instead of the correct \( x - 15 = 36 \).

## 5: Assessing student understanding at different levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulations. They might choose D) Neither is correct because they don't see how to proceed or might incorrectly validate Katie's step due to a lack of understanding of equation balancing.
- **Basic**: Basic level students might understand simple algebraic manipulations but could be tricked by Katie's seemingly plausible but incorrect step, especially if they rush or don't fully check their work. They might choose B) Only Katie.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students should easily see that Tom's step is correct and Katie's is not. They understand how to isolate variables and check equations. They are likely to choose A) Only Tom.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the correct manipulations but can also quickly identify incorrect ones. They would easily validate Tom's step and invalidate Katie's, likely choosing A) Only Tom.

## 6: Estimating percentages based on common errors and understanding
Given the nature of the question and common mistakes:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some see Tom's correct method), B=30% (some mistakenly think Katie is right), C=10% (unlikely to understand both correctly), D=20% (don't understand either).
- **Basic**: A=60% (most see Tom's method), B=20% (some still fall for Katie), C=10% (few understand both), D=10% (a few see neither).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (most correctly identify Tom), B=5% (few mistakenly choose Katie), C=5% (very few think both are correct), D=10% (a few might be unsure).
- **Advanced**: A=90% (clearly see Tom's correctness), B=0% (unlikely to mistakenly choose Katie), C=5% (some might consider both but correctly identify Tom), D=5% (very few might question both).

## 7: Converting to required format
Based on estimations:
- below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
- basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
- advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
