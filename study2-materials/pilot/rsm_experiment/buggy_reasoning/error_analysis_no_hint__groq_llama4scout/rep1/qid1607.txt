To approach this question, let's first analyze the steps provided and the common mistakes students might make.

## Step 1: Understand the Given Equation and Steps
The equation given is \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \). To solve for \(k\), one would multiply both sides by 4 to get \( 60 = 1 + k \), and then subtract 1 from both sides to get \( k = 59 \).

## 2: Analyze Isaac's Steps
Isaac's Step 1: \( 60 = 1 + k \) is correct because multiplying both sides of the equation \( 15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \) by 4 yields \( 60 = 1 + k \).

## 3: Analyze Isaac's Step 2
Isaac's Step 2: \( 61 = k \) is incorrect because to isolate \(k\), one should subtract 1 from both sides of \( 60 = 1 + k \), resulting in \( k = 59 \), not \( 61 \).

## 4: Determine the Correctness of Each Step
- Step 1 is correct.
- Step 2 is incorrect.

## 5: Predict Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulation. They might incorrectly validate both steps or incorrectly dismiss both. Given the nature of the question, a significant portion might choose \( B \) (Only step 2) because they see the calculation in step 2 and think it's correct without properly checking step 1, or they might choose \( D \) (Both steps are incorrect) if they recognize step 2 is wrong but not understand step 1 is correct. 
  - \( A = 20\% \) (understanding step 1 but not validating step 2 properly)
  - \( B = 30\% \) (incorrectly think step 2 is correct)
  - \( C = 5\% \) (incorrectly think both are correct)
  - \( D = 45\% \) (recognize step 2 is wrong, might or might not validate step 1)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make calculation errors or not fully validate steps.
  - \( A = 40\% \) (see step 1 as correct but validate step 2 as incorrect)
  - \( B = 20\% \) (still confused about step 2)
  - \( C = 5\% \) (think both correct, misunderstanding algebra)
  - \( D = 35\% \) (understand both steps' correctness)

- **Proficient:** These students understand algebra but might get complacent.
  - \( A = 60\% \) (correctly identify step 1 as correct, step 2 as incorrect)
  - \( B = 10\% \) (might mistakenly validate step 2)
  - \( C = 5\% \) (error in validation)
  - \( D = 25\% \) (might over-cautiously mark both incorrect)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are likely to accurately assess both steps.
  - \( A = 80\% \) (clearly see step 1 is correct, step 2 incorrect)
  - \( B = 5\% \) (very few would mistakenly think only step 2 is correct)
  - \( C = 0\% \) (would not think both are correct given the obvious mistake in step 2)
  - \( D = 15\% \) (might mistakenly think both are wrong, though less likely)

## 6: Provide Predictions
Given these considerations:

- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=5% D=45%
- basic: A=40% B=20% C=5% D=35%
- proficient: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
- advanced: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=5% D=45%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%
