## Step 1: Understanding the question and potential errors
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct method involves using the FOIL technique (First, Outer, Inner, Last) or the distributive property twice. The correct answer can be calculated as \(m \cdot m + m \cdot (-7) - 5 \cdot m - 5 \cdot (-7)\), which simplifies to \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 2: Identifying potential calculation errors
- Option A: \(m^2 - 2m - 35\). This could result from incorrectly multiplying the terms, possibly \(m \cdot m - 2 \cdot m - 35\), suggesting a mistake in handling the middle terms.
- Option B: \(m^2 - 12m + 35\). This is the correct answer, achieved by properly applying the FOIL method: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).
- Option C: \(m^2 + 12m + 35\). This might come from \(m \cdot m + 7m + 5m + 35\), indicating a mistake where both middle terms are added instead of subtracted.
- Option D: \(m^2 - 12m - 35\). This could result from \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35\), suggesting a mistake where the constant term is subtracted instead of added.

## 3: Analyzing attractive errors
- The error leading to Option A (\(m^2 - 2m - 35\)) might seem plausible if students incorrectly simplify the middle terms, thinking \(-7m - 5m = -2m\), which could appeal to students who are not careful with signs or do not fully apply the distributive property.
- The error leading to Option C (\(m^2 + 12m + 35\)) seems less likely for proficient students but could occur if students mistakenly add the middle terms instead of subtracting them, which might be an honest mistake for those not fully confident.
- Option D (\(m^2 - 12m - 35\)) could appeal to students who are confident in their ability to multiply but struggle with the signs, particularly if they've made similar mistakes before.

## 4: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle significantly with the algebra. They could randomly choose or make basic calculation mistakes. Option A and C might seem attractive due to simple addition/subtraction errors.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the concept but apply it incorrectly. They could struggle to keep track of negative signs, making Options A and D plausible.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the method but might make careless mistakes. Option A could be a common mistake due to its seeming plausibility.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are less likely to make mistakes but could if they're rushing or not checking their work.

## 5: Estimating percentages
Given the nature of the mistakes:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple mistake), B=20% (might get it right by chance), C=30% (addition mistake), D=20% (other).
- **Basic**: A=40% (common mistake), B=40% (correct), C=10% (less common), D=10% (less likely).
- **Proficient**: A=20% (careless mistake), B=70% (correct), C=5% (unlikely), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (unlikely), B=90% (correct), C=2.5% (very unlikely), D=2.5% (very unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=40% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2.5% D=2.5%
