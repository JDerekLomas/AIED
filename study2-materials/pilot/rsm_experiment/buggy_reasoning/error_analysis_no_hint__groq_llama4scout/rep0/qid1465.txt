## Step 1: Understanding the Question and Possible Errors
The question requires the evaluation of the expression \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). To solve this, one must follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). The correct calculation is:
\[3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 = 3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6\]

## 2: Identifying Common Errors
- **Option A (6)**: This is the correct answer. Students who understand and apply BIDMAS correctly will choose this.
- **Option B (4)**: This could result from a calculation error such as \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 = 2\), and \(2 \times 2 = 4\), which is incorrect because it misinterprets the order of operations and incorrectly applies them.
- **Option C (-12)**: This might come from \(4 \times 2 = 8\), then \(3 - 5 = -2\), and \(-2 - 8 = -10\), but some students might incorrectly calculate it as \(-2 + (-8) = -10\) or simply add/subtract incorrectly: \(3 - 5 + 8 = 3 - 13 = -10\), indicating a possible confusion in operations.
- **Option D (-10)**: A common error leading to this answer could be \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(4 \times 2 = 8\), and finally \(-2 + 8 = 6\), but if a student incorrectly calculates \(-2 \times 4 = -8\) or adds/subtracts out of order, they might get \(-10\). More likely, it comes from doing \(3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 = 3 - 9 \times 2 = 3 - 18 = -15\) or similar incorrect operations, or simply miscalculating: \(3 - 5 = -2\) and then \(-2 - 8 = -10\).

## 3: Analyzing Attractive Wrong Answers
- The most attractive wrong answer seems to be **Option D (-10)**, as it might result from incorrect but seemingly logical steps such as calculating from left to right without properly applying BIDMAS: \(3 - 5 = -2\), \(4 \times 2 = 8\), then assuming addition and subtraction are done linearly without respect to order of operations.
- **Option B (4)** could be chosen by those who misunderstand the multiplication's impact or mistakenly apply operations.

## 4: Predictions Based on Ability Levels
### below_basic
- These students often struggle with basic arithmetic and order of operations.
- **A=20%** (those who guess or partially understand BIDMAS)
- **B=30%** (simple addition/subtraction errors)
- **C=20%** (misunderstand multiplication effect)
- **D=30%** (completely misunderstand order of operations)

### basic
- Students have a foundational understanding but are prone to errors.
- **A=40%** (understand BIDMAS but might miscalculate)
- **B=25%** (apply operations out of order or incorrect calculation)
- **C=15%** (significant calculation mistakes)
- **D=20%** (partial understanding but incorrect application)

### proficient
- These students generally understand BIDMAS and can apply it.
- **A=70%** (correct application of BIDMAS)
- **B=15%** (some minor calculation errors)
- **C=5%** (oversights in calculation)
- **D=10%** (either calculation mistakes or not following BIDMAS)

### advanced
- Students with strong maths skills and understanding.
- **A=90%** (easy application of BIDMAS)
- **B=5%** (very minor, careless errors)
- **C=2%** (unlikely but possible minor errors)
- **D=3%** (unusual to make such a basic mistake)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
