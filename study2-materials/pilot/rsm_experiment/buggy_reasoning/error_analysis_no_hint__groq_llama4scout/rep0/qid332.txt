## Step 1: Analyzing the question and potential errors
The question requires students to solve the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) and evaluate the correctness of two proposed next lines of working: \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\) by Tom, and \(x - 5 = 36\) by Katie.

## 2: Evaluating Tom's proposal
Tom's proposal, \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), is a correct next step. To get to this line, one would add 5 to both sides of the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\), resulting in \(\frac{x}{3} = 12 + 5 = 17\). This step is algebraically sound.

## 3: Evaluating Katie's proposal
Katie's proposal, \(x - 5 = 36\), can be evaluated by first multiplying every term in the original equation by 3 to clear the fraction: \(x - 15 = 36\). This is not what Katie proposed. However, if Katie mistakenly thought multiplying by 3 would directly apply to \(-5\) as \(3 \times -5 = -15\), but then incorrectly wrote \(x - 5 = 36\), it seems like a confusion. The correct manipulation from the original equation would indeed involve multiplying by 3: \(x - 15 = 36\), which then correctly rearranges to \(x = 51\). Katie's step seems incorrect because it doesn't properly account for multiplying the entire equation by 3.

## 4: Identifying calculation errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error for students who choose Katie's option might be misunderstanding how to clear the fraction or incorrectly applying operations to parts of the equation.
- Tom's option is straightforward and correct, making it more likely that students who understand adding to both sides of the equation will choose this.

## 5: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulations. They might choose Katie's option because it seems like a simple multiplication (even though it's incorrect), and not recognize Tom's as correct. They could also struggle to see why either is correct or incorrect. **A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%**
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to recognize Tom's step as correct but might be tempted by Katie's if they don't fully understand the multiplication step. **A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%**
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebraic steps well and are less likely to fall into traps. They will see Tom's step as correct and Katie's as incorrect due to not properly multiplying every term by 3. **A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%**
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and can see through incorrect steps easily. They will correctly identify Tom's proposal as valid and Katie's as not, without confusion. **A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%**

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis, the predictions are as follows:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
