## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential errors
The question requires students to compare the values of two expressions: \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\). To solve this, students need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

## 2: Calculate the correct values of the expressions
First, calculate \(8+12 \div 4\):
- \(12 \div 4 = 3\)
- \(8 + 3 = 11\)

Then, calculate \((8+12) \div 4\):
- \(8 + 12 = 20\)
- \(20 \div 4 = 5\)

## 3: Compare the expressions and determine the correct symbol
Since \(11 > 5\), the correct symbol to use is \(>\).

## 4: Analyze potential errors for each option
- Option A (\(>\)) is correct based on the calculations.
- Option B (\(<\)) would be chosen by students who incorrectly think \((8+12) \div 4 > 8+12 \div 4\).
- Option C (\(=\)) would be chosen by students who think the expressions are equal, possibly due to misunderstanding the order of operations.
- Option D (\(\geq\)) would be chosen by students who think the expressions could be equal or the first is greater.

## 5: Identify specific calculation errors leading to wrong answers
- A common error leading to B (\(<\)) could be from students who evaluate \(8+12 \div 4\) as \((8+12) \div 4\) or vice versa without applying the correct order of operations.
- An error leading to C (\(=\)) could be from students who ignore the order of operations entirely and calculate from left to right or assume both expressions simplify to the same value without calculation.

## 6: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option
### below_basic
- Students at this level often struggle with basic arithmetic and order of operations. They might incorrectly calculate or compare the expressions.
- \(A = 20\%\) (some might get it right by chance or simple calculation)
- \(B = 40\%\) (misunderstanding of operations)
- \(C = 30\%\) (thinking they are equal due to lack of understanding)
- \(D = 10\%\) (not a common choice for this level)

### basic
- Students at this level have a basic understanding but might make careless mistakes.
- \(A = 50\%\) (understanding the operations)
- \(B = 25\%\) (careless mistakes in calculation)
- \(C = 20\%\) (some still confuse the operations)
- \(D = 5\%\) (rarely chosen)

### proficient
- Students at this level understand the operations but might make strategic errors.
- \(A = 80\%\) (clear understanding)
- \(B = 10\%\) (occasional mistake)
- \(C = 5\%\) (rarely confuse)
- \(D = 5\%\) (rare consideration of equality)

### advanced
- Students at this level have a strong grasp and rarely make mistakes.
- \(A = 95\%\) (excellent understanding)
- \(B = 3\%\) (very rare mistake)
- \(C = 1\%\) (extremely rare)
- \(D = 1\%\) (extremely rare)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
