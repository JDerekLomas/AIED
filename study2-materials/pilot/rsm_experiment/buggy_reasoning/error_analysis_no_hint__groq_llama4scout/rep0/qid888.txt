## Step 1: Understand the question and the common errors
The question requires students to multiply out the brackets: \((m-5)(m-7)\). The correct answer can be found using the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last), which yields \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\). Common errors include mistakes in applying the FOIL method, incorrect handling of negative signs, and simple arithmetic errors.

## 2: Identify the specific calculation errors leading to each wrong answer
- Option A: \(m^2 - 2m - 35\). This could result from incorrectly calculating the middle term, perhaps \(-7m - 5m = -2m\) instead of \(-12m\), suggesting a miscalculation in the application of FOIL.
- Option C: \(m^2 + 12m + 35\). This might come from incorrectly adding the middle terms, \( -7m - 5m = +12m\), which is a mistake in handling negative signs.
- Option D: \(m^2 - 12m - 35\). This error could arise from mistakenly subtracting 35 instead of adding it, possibly due to a confusion with the signs or a simple arithmetic mistake.

## 3: Determine which errors are "attractive" and which students would catch themselves
- Errors that feel natural or are attractive tend to result from partial understanding or common misconceptions. For example, getting \(m^2 - 2m - 35\) (Option A) might seem plausible to students who are not fully confident in their ability to multiply out brackets or who make a simple arithmetic mistake.
- Students at lower levels (below_basic and basic) are more likely to fall into traps such as mistakenly adding or subtracting terms or mishandling negative signs.
- Proficient and advanced students are less likely to make simple arithmetic mistakes but might still struggle with more complex algebraic manipulations or conceptual understanding.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level choosing each option
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below_basic**: These students are likely to struggle significantly and make basic errors. They might choose A (30%), B (20%), C (20%), and D (30%) due to a lack of understanding of the FOIL method or simple arithmetic errors.
- **Basic**: Basic students will have a better grasp of the method but still make some errors. They might choose A (25%), B (40%), C (20%), and D (15%) as they start to apply the FOIL method but may struggle with signs or arithmetic.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the method but might make occasional errors. They could choose A (15%), B (70%), C (10%), and D (5%) as they generally apply the FOIL method correctly but may have minor lapses.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to get it right most of the time. They might choose A (5%), B (85%), C (5%), and D (5%) as they have a strong grasp of algebraic manipulations.

## 5: Assign percentages based on the predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
