## Step 1: Understand the question and the equation given
The equation provided is \(y = 3x^2\), and we need to find \(y\) when \(x = 0.3\). The correct calculation is \(y = 3 \times (0.3)^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\).

## 2: Identify the wrong answers and the calculation errors leading to them
- Option A: \(0.81\) could result from \(3 \times 0.3 = 0.9\) and then squaring it, or simply misinterpreting the equation as \(y = 3x\) and then squaring \(0.3\) but not multiplying by 3, which doesn't directly lead to \(0.81\). However, \(0.9^2 = 0.81\), suggesting a possible error where \(0.3\) is incorrectly squared or used.
- Option B: \(0.27\) is the correct answer as calculated in step 1.
- Option C: \(1.8\) could result from \(3 \times 0.3^2 = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\), but then mistakenly multiplying \(0.3\) by \(3\) and then by \(2\), which doesn't directly apply. A plausible error could be \(3 \times 0.6 = 1.8\), implying a mistake in squaring \(0.3\) to get \(0.6\) instead of \(0.09\).
- Option D: \(2.7\) could result from simply \(3 \times 0.9 = 2.7\), implying \(0.3\) was incorrectly squared or used as \(0.9\).

## 3: Analyze the attractive wrong methods
- A common error could be misinterpreting \(x^2\) as \(2x\) or just \(x\), leading to \(y = 3 \times 0.3 = 0.9\) or similar simple multiplication errors.
- Another error might involve incorrect squaring or not squaring at all.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option
### Below Basic
Students at this level often struggle with basic calculations and may not fully understand the equation.
- They might choose B (correct) if they understand basic substitution and calculation.
- A (0.81) could be chosen if they mistakenly calculate \(0.3^2 = 0.9\) and then \(3 \times 0.9 = 0.27\), not getting \(0.81\).
- C (1.8) and D (2.7) might be chosen due to very basic calculation errors.

### Basic
At this level, students have a grasp of basic algebraic concepts but might make calculation mistakes.
- They are likely to choose B (correct) if calculations are accurate.
- Errors leading to A, C, or D could be due to mishandling of exponents or simple arithmetic mistakes.

### Proficient
Proficient students understand the concepts well but might make occasional errors under time pressure.
- They are likely to choose B (correct) as they can accurately substitute and calculate.
- Mistakes could lead to A if they incorrectly calculate \(0.3^2\) or misinterpret the equation.

### Advanced
Advanced students have a strong grasp of concepts and are less likely to make basic errors.
- They will mostly choose B (correct).
- Errors might be minimal, possibly leading to A if there's a very minor miscalculation.

## 5: Estimate percentages based on typical student errors and understanding
Given typical errors and assuming a somewhat normal distribution of abilities:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (simple errors), B=40% (some understanding), C=20% (basic miscalculation), D=20% (direct multiplication error).
- **Basic**: A=10% (occasional errors), B=70% (understand and calculate correctly), C=10% (miscalculate), D=10% (simple error).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (minor error), B=90% (accurate calculation), C=3% (error in calculation), D=2% (rare mistake).
- **Advanced**: A=1% (rare minor mistake), B=98% (correct calculation), C=0.5% (very rare error), D=0.5% (very rare error).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%
