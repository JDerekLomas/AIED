## Step 1: Understanding the Problems
First, let's understand the two problems given and the correct order of operations for each. Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \) and Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). For Problem P, since it only involves addition and subtraction, we perform the operations from left to right. Therefore, the correct order is to do \( 4-5 \) first. For Problem Q, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), we must do the multiplication first, so \( 5 \times 6 \) should be calculated before \( 4+ \) the result.

## 2: Identifying Correct Answers
For Problem P, the correct calculation to do first is \( 4-5 \), which corresponds to option A for Problem P. For Problem Q, the correct calculation to do first is \( 5 \times 6 \), making option B the correct choice when considering both problems.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Errors
- Students who are not familiar with the order of operations might incorrectly start with \( 5+6 \) in Problem P, which doesn't apply since there's no multiplication or division, but it could be a mistaken approach if they mistakenly apply a rule.
- For Problem Q, a common mistake is to ignore the order of operations and do \( 4+5 \) first, which is an "attractive" error because it follows the sequence of numbers as they appear.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** These students may struggle with understanding the order of operations. They might choose an option that seems logical but incorrect, such as starting with addition in Problem P or not recognizing the need for multiplication first in Problem Q. Option A seems logical for a straightforward approach but might not be chosen due to confusion. Option B (Problem P: \( 4-5 \); Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \)) is the correct approach, but below-basic students might not identify this correctly.
- **Basic:** Basic-level students have a foundational understanding but may still make careless mistakes. They are more likely to recognize the correct order for Problem Q (\( 5 \times 6 \)) but might still be confused about the sequence in Problem P.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the order of operations and are less likely to make mistakes. They should easily identify \( 4-5 \) for Problem P and \( 5 \times 6 \) for Problem Q as the correct first steps.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the order of operations but also apply it with ease. They are likely to choose the correct option without hesitation.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the nature of the questions and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (simple left-to-right approach), B=20% (correct but might not understand why), C=20% (confusion), D=20% (addition first in P, multiplication in Q seems right but misapplied).
- **Basic:** A=30% (easy but incorrect for Q), B=40% (understands Q but might struggle with P), C=15% (misunderstanding), D=15% (correct understanding).
- **Proficient:** A=10% (some confusion), B=80% (correct understanding of both), C=5% (careless mistake), D=5% (might overthink).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (understands order of operations), B=90% (easily identifies correct steps), C=5% (unlikely but possible minor lapse), D=5% (unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
