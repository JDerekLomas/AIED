## Step 1: Understanding the task
To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, we first need to understand what each option implies and the common errors students might make.

## 2: Analyzing option A
Option A: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) suggests adding all the numbers except 0 and then dividing by 5. This error involves omitting one of the numbers (0 in this case) from the sum, which could be due to overlooking its contribution or thinking it's not necessary for the sum.

## 3: Analyzing option B
Option B: \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \) implies adding all the numbers and then dividing 7 by 5, not the sum of all numbers by 5. This would be a misinterpretation of order of operations.

## 4: Analyzing option C
Option C: \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \) suggests adding all the numbers except 0 and then dividing by 4, which is the count of numbers excluding 0. This error involves both omitting a number and using the wrong divisor.

## 5: Analyzing option D
Option D: "None of them" implies that none of the provided calculations yield the correct mean. The correct calculation for the mean is \( \frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5} \).

## 6: Considering common errors and ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic operations and understanding of what the mean represents. They might choose options that seem simplest or most appealing without deep calculation, such as B, which seems to follow a "add then divide" logic but incorrectly applies it.
- **Basic**: Students here understand basic concepts but might make straightforward calculation errors. They could opt for A if they think omitting 0 is okay or C if they count numbers wrong.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of mean but might still fall into traps if the calculation seems straightforward or familiar. They are less likely to choose B due to understanding order of operations but might consider A or C if they misinterpret how to include all numbers or count them.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to accurately calculate the mean and understand that all numbers must be included and divided by the total count. They should identify A as correct or D if they see errors in others.

## 7: Predicting percentages
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (simple addition and division, might omit 0), B=40% (seems to apply operations), C=20% (omits 0 and uses wrong count), D=20% (doubtful of all).
- **Basic**: A=30% (forgets 0), B=25% (misinterprets operations), C=30% (counts numbers wrong), D=15% (sees through errors).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (understands mean calculation), B=5% (unlikely to misinterpret operations), C=5% (less likely to count wrong), D=10% (critical thinkers).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (accurately calculates), B=0% (understands operations), C=0% (accurately counts), D=5% (almost certain A is correct).

## 8: Final prediction
Based on typical student errors and understanding:
- below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
- basic: A=30% B=25% C=30% D=15%
- proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
- advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
