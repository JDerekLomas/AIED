## Step 1: Understand the question and the steps provided by Isaac.
Isaac is solving the equation \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\). His steps are:
Step 1: \(60 = 1 + k\)
Step 2: \(61 = k\)

## 2: Evaluate the correctness of each step.
To solve \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\), first multiply both sides by 4 to get \(60 = 1 + k\). This confirms that Step 1 is correct.

## 3: Continue evaluating the correctness of each step.
Then, subtract 1 from both sides to get \(59 = k\). This means Step 2, where \(61 = k\), is incorrect because it incorrectly states \(k = 61\) instead of \(k = 59\).

## 4: Analyze the potential errors leading to each wrong answer.
- The calculation error leading to choosing B (Only step 2) would involve recognizing Step 2 as correct but not evaluating the initial step properly.
- The error leading to choosing C (Both steps are correct) would involve not checking the arithmetic in Step 2 properly.
- The error leading to choosing D (Both steps are incorrect) would involve misinterpreting or miscalculating both steps.

## 5: Determine which errors are "attractive" and which students might fall into these traps.
- Students might find B attractive if they incorrectly solve for \(k\) but believe their initial manipulation was correct.
- C could be attractive for students who don't check their arithmetic properly.
- D might be chosen by students who see both steps as incorrect due to misunderstanding the equation.

## 6: Consider student ability levels and their likely errors.
- Below_basic students might struggle with basic algebra and could easily fall into traps like D due to lack of understanding.
- Basic students might get Step 1 right but struggle with Step 2, potentially choosing B.
- Proficient students are likely to identify Step 1 as correct but might make arithmetic mistakes leading to C or B.
- Advanced students are likely to catch errors in both steps and choose A.

## 7: Estimate the percentage of students at each ability level choosing each option.
Given the nature of the question:
- **Below_basic**: These students often lack foundational skills. They might find D attractive due to confusion (D=40%, A=20%, B=20%, C=20%).
- **Basic**: Students here understand basic algebra but might make simple mistakes. They could choose B if they think Step 2 is correct but don't verify (A=30%, B=25%, C=20%, D=25%).
- **Proficient**: These students know algebra well but can make careless errors. They might choose C if they're confident in their initial step but mischeck the second (A=40%, B=15%, C=30%, D=15%).
- **Advanced**: These students are detail-oriented and less likely to make simple arithmetic errors. They'd likely choose A (A=60%, B=5%, C=25%, D=10%).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
proficient: A=40% B=15% C=30% D=15%
advanced: A=60% B=5% C=25% D=10%
