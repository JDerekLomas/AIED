To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls for each ability level.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Answer
The correct calculation using the algebraic convention for \( c \div (h+4) \) is \( \frac{c}{h+4} \), which corresponds to option A. This is a straightforward application of algebraic notation where division by a term is represented as a fraction.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \), suggests adding 4 to \( c \) before dividing by \( h+4 \). This could be an attractive mistake for students who misinterpret the order of operations or mistakenly think that "division by \( h+4 \)" implies both \( c \) and \( h+4 \) are in the denominator and \( c \) gets \( +4 \) to balance. However, this would actually represent \( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \) which could stem from a mistaken expansion or incorrect application of rules.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \frac{c}{h} + 4 \), implies that \( c \) is divided by \( h \) first, and then 4 is added. This mistake comes from incorrectly applying the order of operations within the division by a sum. Students might choose this if they incorrectly interpret \( c \div (h+4) \) as doing the division and addition separately without considering the denominator as a whole.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( \frac{h+4}{c} \), inverts both \( c \) and \( h+4 \), suggesting \( h+4 \) is divided by \( c \), which is the inverse operation of what's asked.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students struggling with basic algebra might find all options challenging but could easily fall into traps. They might choose B (20%), C (25%), or D (30%) due to confusion with operations and notation, with A (25%) being a safer but still not guaranteed choice.
- **Basic:** Basic level students might understand fractions but struggle with order of operations. They might choose A (60%) correctly but have significant errors: B (20%), C (15%), D (5%).
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are likely to choose A (90%) as they understand algebraic notation well. Mistakes might occur but are less frequent: B (5%), C (3%), D (2%).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students would almost universally choose A (98%) correctly, with very few errors: B (1%), C (0.5%), D (0.5%).

## 6: Percentage Predictions
Based on typical student performance:
- **below_basic:** A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
- **basic:** A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
- **proficient:** A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- **advanced:** A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
