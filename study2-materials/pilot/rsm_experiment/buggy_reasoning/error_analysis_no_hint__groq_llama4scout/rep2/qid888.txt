## Step 1: Understanding the question and possible errors
To solve the question \((m-5)(m-7)\), students need to apply the FOIL method, which stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. This means they multiply the first terms in each bracket, then the outer, then the inner, and finally the last terms, and then add them all together: \(m \cdot m + m \cdot (-7) + (-5) \cdot m + (-5) \cdot (-7)\). This simplifies to \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35 = m^2 - 12m + 35\).

## 2: Identifying common errors
A common error is to forget to distribute the negative sign properly or to misapply the FOIL method. For instance, some might calculate it as \(m^2 - 7m + 5m - 35 = m^2 - 2m - 35\), which corresponds to option A. Others might incorrectly add the terms or mistakenly multiply, leading to various incorrect answers.

## 3: Analyzing option A (\(m^{2}-2 m-35\))
This error typically arises from incorrectly applying FOIL: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m - 35\), mistakenly thinking the middle terms should be added instead of subtracted, or simply miscalculating the signs.

## 4: Analyzing option B (\(m^{2}-12 m+35\))
This is the correct answer. Students who understand and correctly apply the FOIL method will get this.

## 5: Analyzing option C (\(m^{2}+12 m+35\))
This could result from a student mistakenly adding the middle terms instead of subtracting them: \(m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35\) becomes \(m^2 + 12m + 35\) if they incorrectly change the signs of both \(m\) terms to positive, or similar logical fallacies.

## 6: Analyzing option D (\(m^{2}-12 m-35\))
This might come from someone correctly getting \(m^2 - 12m\) but then mistakenly subtracting 35 instead of adding it.

## 7: Estimating error rates by ability level
- **Below Basic:** These students are likely to make significant errors. They might struggle with basic algebra and the FOIL method. Option A seems plausible as it involves a straightforward but incorrect calculation. Option C could also be attractive due to its simplicity and symmetry. **Below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%**
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a grasp of basic concepts but may still make careless mistakes. They are more likely to get the correct answer but might fall into traps. **Basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%**
- **Proficient:** These students understand the FOIL method and are less likely to make simple mistakes. However, they might still occasionally slip up. **Proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%**
- **Advanced:** These students are confident and accurate. They understand the method and are unlikely to make errors. **Advanced: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
