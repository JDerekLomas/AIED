## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential errors
The question requires students to evaluate two proposed next steps in solving the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\). Tom suggests \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), and Katie suggests \(x - 5 = 36\). To assess who is correct, we need to understand the correct method and common errors.

## 2: Identify the correct solution step
To solve \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\), first add 5 to both sides, resulting in \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This matches Tom's suggestion, making Tom correct. Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), would be incorrect because to get \(x - 5 = 36\), one would multiply both sides of the original equation by 3, which is not the step Katie describes as her derivation directly from the original equation.

## 3: Analyze Tom's suggestion
Tom's suggestion, \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), is correct because adding 5 to both sides of the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) yields \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\). This is a straightforward and correct algebraic manipulation.

## 4: Analyze Katie's suggestion
Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), implies multiplying the entire original equation by 3, which would give \(x - 15 = 36\), not \(x - 5 = 36\). Thus, Katie's suggestion as presented does not directly follow from the original equation in a standard algebraic step.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic manipulations. They might pick an answer based on a superficial understanding or guess. Given the complexity, they might lean towards "neither" or a guess, but could also be attracted to an option that seems simple or familiar. **Below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%**
- **Basic**: Basic level students understand simple algebra but might make careless errors. They could see Tom's step as clearly correct but might be confused by Katie's. They might recognize Tom's correctness but not Katie's, leading to **basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%**
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand algebraic manipulations well. They should easily see Tom's step as correct. Katie's step seems incorrect upon inspection because it doesn't properly account for multiplying by 3. Thus, **proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%**
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand but can also critically evaluate algebraic steps. They will clearly see Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrectness. Hence, **advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%**

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
