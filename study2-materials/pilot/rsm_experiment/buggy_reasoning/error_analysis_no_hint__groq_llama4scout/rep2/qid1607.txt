To approach this question, let's analyze the steps provided by Isaac and the potential errors students might make.

## Step 1: Understanding the Equation and Isaac's Steps
The given equation is \( 15 = \frac{1 + k}{4} \). To solve for \( k \), one would first multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the denominator, which yields \( 60 = 1 + k \). This matches Isaac's Step 1, indicating that Step 1 is correct.

## 2: Identifying the Error in Isaac's Steps
From Step 1, \( 60 = 1 + k \), to solve for \( k \), one would subtract 1 from both sides, resulting in \( k = 59 \). However, Isaac's Step 2 states \( 61 = k \), which is incorrect because he added 1 instead of subtracting 1 from 60.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Student Errors
- **Calculation Error Leading to Wrong Answers**: The main error here is not recognizing that to isolate \( k \), one must subtract 1 from both sides after getting \( 60 = 1 + k \).
- **Attractive Errors**: The error in Step 2 (\( 61 = k \)) might seem attractive because it's a simple addition, but it's based on a misunderstanding of algebraic manipulation.
- **Students' Likelihood of Catching Themselves**: Students who are proficient or advanced are more likely to catch the mistake in Step 2 because they understand the correct algebraic operations. Those who are below basic or basic might struggle with the algebraic manipulation and thus might fall into the trap of accepting Step 2 as correct or not recognizing the error.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand algebraic equations. They might not even attempt Step 1 correctly or might not understand what's being asked. They could randomly select or choose an option that seems "right" without calculation.
- **Basic**: At this level, students understand basic algebra but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are likely to get Step 1 right but could struggle with Step 2.
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebra well and are likely to identify that Step 1 is correct but Step 2 is not.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will easily see that Step 1 is correct and Step 2 is incorrect.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle to follow the steps correctly, so they might choose \( D \) (both steps are incorrect) if they see an obvious mistake or choose \( B \) (only Step 2) if they incorrectly validate Step 2. \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 40\% \)
- **Basic**: Students here might get Step 1 right but mess up Step 2, so they could choose \( A \) (only Step 1). \( A = 50\% \), \( B = 25\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 15\% \)
- **Proficient**: These students will likely see Step 1 as correct and Step 2 as incorrect. \( A = 70\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 15\% \)
- **Advanced**: They will accurately assess both steps. \( A = 90\% \), \( B = 0\% \), \( C = 0\% \), \( D = 10\% \)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
