## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to multiply the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((2p-1)(3p-4)\), which are \(-1\) and \(-4\). The correct calculation is \((-1) \times (-4) = 4\).

## 2: Identifying Wrong Answers and Calculation Errors
- Option A: \(+4\) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \(-4\) would be a result of \(-1 \times 4\) or \(1 \times -4\), not \(-1 \times -4\).
- Option C: \(+5\) does not result from multiplying \(-1\) and \(-4\).
- Option D: \(-5\) also does not result from multiplying \(-1\) and \(-4\).

## 3: Analyzing Errors
- The error leading to Option B (\(-4\)) is a failure to apply the rule that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result.
- Options C (\(+5\)) and D (\(-5\)) seem to come from random or incorrect calculations not directly related to the multiplication of \(-1\) and \(-4\).

## 4: Assessing Attractiveness of Wrong Methods
- Option B (\(-4\)) might be attractive to students who forget that two negatives make a positive.
- Options C and D seem less directly related to common multiplication errors and might appeal to students who are not careful or make calculation mistakes.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: These students may struggle with basic multiplication rules or not understand the concept of negative numbers. They might choose B (\(-4\)) because they forget the rule about multiplying negatives, or C and D due to general confusion.
- **Basic**: Basic level students should know that two negatives make a positive but might still make careless errors. They are likely to choose A (\(+4\)) but might be tempted by B (\(-4\)).
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the rules and are less likely to make simple errors. They should mostly choose A (\(+4\)).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are expected to have a strong grasp of algebraic rules and are likely to choose A (\(+4\)) with minimal errors.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=50% (some get it right by chance or basic understanding), B=30% (common error), C=10%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: A=70%, B=20%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=90%, B=5%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
