To approach this question, let's first consider the correct calculation and the algebraic convention involved. The expression \( c \div (h + 4) \) translates to \( \frac{c}{h + 4} \) according to the correct algebraic convention, which implies that option A is the correct answer.

## Step 1: Identifying Common Errors
- Option B (\( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \)) might result from a misinterpretation where students add 4 to both the numerator and the denominator or consider it as \( c + 4 \div h + 4 \), a misapplication of order of operations.
- Option C (\( \frac{c}{h} + 4 \)) could arise from students incorrectly performing the division and then adding 4, possibly due to misunderstanding the order of operations or the distribution of division over addition.
- Option D (\( \frac{h+4}{c} \)) seems to result from a simple inversion of the fraction, possibly suggesting the student mistakenly thought of the division the other way around.

## 2: Attractive Errors and Student Mistakes
- **Basic and Below Basic Levels**: Students at these levels are more prone to making simple arithmetic and operational mistakes. They might not fully understand or remember the algebraic conventions, leading to a higher likelihood of choosing B, C, or D due to confusion about how to handle the division and addition within the expression.
- **Proficient Level**: Students here have a better grasp of algebraic conventions but might still fall into traps if they misread the expression or misapply rules. They are less likely to choose D but might consider B or C if they misunderstand the expression.
- **Advanced Level**: These students are expected to have a solid understanding of algebraic expressions and conventions. They are less likely to make simple errors and are more likely to choose A.

## 3: Predicting Percentages
Given the nature of the errors:
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to have significant difficulties. They might not understand the concept of algebraic expressions or the importance of brackets. A=30% (some might get it right by chance or recall), B=40% (adding seems a natural operation), C=20% (distribution mistake), D=10% (inversion).
- **Basic**: A bit more understanding but still prone to simple mistakes. A=50%, B=30%, C=15%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: Better understanding but might make subtle mistakes. A=80%, B=15%, C=4%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: Strong understanding, less likely to make mistakes. A=95%, B=4%, C=1%, D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
