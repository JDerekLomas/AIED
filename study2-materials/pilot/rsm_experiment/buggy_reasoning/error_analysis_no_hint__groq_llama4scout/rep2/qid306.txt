To approach this question, let's analyze the problems and the common mistakes students might make, then predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option.

## Step 1: Analyze Problem P
Problem P is \( 4-5+6= \). According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we should perform addition and subtraction from left to right. So, the correct calculation order is \( 4-5 \) first, then add 6.

## 2: Analyze Problem Q
Problem Q is \( 4+5 \times 6= \). Following the order of operations, multiplication should be done before addition. So, the correct calculation order is \( 5 \times 6 \) first, then add 4.

## 3: Evaluate Option A
Option A suggests for Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and for Problem Q: \( 4+5 \). For Problem P, \( 4-5 \) is correct as per the order of operations. However, for Problem Q, \( 4+5 \) is incorrect because it ignores the multiplication.

## 4: Evaluate Option B
Option B suggests for Problem P: \( 4-5 \) and for Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \). This option correctly identifies the operations to be performed first in both problems according to the order of operations.

## 5: Evaluate Option C
Option C suggests for Problem P: \( 5+6 \) and for Problem Q: \( 4+5 \). For Problem P, doing \( 5+6 \) first is incorrect because it disrupts the left-to-right order of addition and subtraction. For Problem Q, \( 4+5 \) is incorrect for the same reason as in Option A.

## 6: Evaluate Option D
Option D suggests for Problem P: \( 5+6 \) and for Problem Q: \( 5 \times 6 \). For Problem P, \( 5+6 \) would be incorrect because it should be done after \( 4-5 \) according to the left-to-right rule for addition and subtraction. For Problem Q, \( 5 \times 6 \) is correct.

## 7: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations. They might randomly select options or choose based on a very superficial understanding. Option A (XX%) and Option C (XX%) could be tempting because they seem straightforward but are incorrect in one or both parts. Option B (likely high) seems correct but might not be recognized as such. Option D (XX%) incorrectly prioritizes operations.
- **Basic:** Students here have a basic grasp but might struggle with applying rules consistently. They might choose Option A (some %) because it seems logical for P but not Q. Option B (higher %) should be appealing as it correctly applies the rules. Options C and D might confuse them.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the order of operations well. They should predominantly choose Option B (high %) as it accurately reflects the correct order for both problems.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand but can apply the rules accurately and efficiently. They will also choose Option B (very high %) as it's the correct application.

## 8: Assign Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
- **Basic:** A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=95% C=2.5% D=2.5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2.5% D=2.5%
