## Step 1: Understand the question and the operations involved
The question requires the evaluation of the expression \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\). To solve it, one must follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). So, the correct steps are: multiplication first (\(4 \times 2 = 8\)), then addition and subtraction from left to right (\(3 - 5 + 8\)).

## 2: Calculate the correct answer
Following BIDMAS:
1. Multiply 4 and 2: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Then, \(3 - 5 + 8 = 6\)
So, the correct answer is \(6\), which corresponds to option A.

## 3: Identify potential errors and attractive wrong methods
- A common error is not following the order of operations, leading to \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 = 3 - 5 + 8 = 3 - 13 = -10\) (option D). This error is attractive because it feels natural to perform operations in the order they appear.
- Another error could be \(3 - 5 \times 4 + 2 = 3 - 20 + 2 = -15\), but this specific calculation isn't an option, indicating a miscalculation in predicting errors.
- For \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2\), incorrectly calculating \(4 \times 2 = 7\) (instead of 8) leads to \(3 - 5 + 7 = 5\), not an option directly but closer to B or A with slight adjustments.
- Directly adding and subtracting without multiplication gives \(3 - 5 + 8 = 6\), but if one mistakenly does \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 8 = 6\), which is correct, or \(-2 \times 2 = -4\), again not directly an option.

## 4: Analyze each option for likely student errors
- Option A (6) is correct. Students who understand BIDMAS will choose this.
- Option B (4) might be chosen by students who miscalculate, such as doing \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(4 \times 2 = 8\), and \(-2 + 8 = 6\), which does not lead to B, indicating B might not be as commonly chosen through simple errors.
- Option C (-12) could result from a miscalculation like \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\), then \(2 \times 2 = 4\), which doesn't align, or other incorrect operations.
- Option D (-10) comes from incorrect order of operations: \(3 - 5 = -2\), then \(-2 + 4 = 2\), and \(2 \times 2 = 4\), again not directly leading to D, but \(3 - (5 + 4) \times 2 = 3 - 9 \times 2 = 3 - 18 = -15\), indicating complex errors.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to make significant errors. They might calculate directly from left to right without considering BIDMAS, leading to option D (-10) as a plausible incorrect answer due to \(3 - 5 + 4 \times 2 = -2 + 8 = 6\) not being their calculation, but they could get -10 by \(3-5= -2; 4*2=8; -2-8=-10\). Let's assume 60% choose D, 20% choose A (somehow stumble upon the right answer), and 10% each for B and C due to random guessing or simple addition/subtraction errors.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand basic operations but struggle with BIDMAS. They could easily fall into the trap of doing operations in the wrong order. Option D seems plausible (30%), and some might still choose A (40%) if they grasp the concept. B and C might see 15% each.
- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to follow BIDMAS correctly. They might still make careless errors but should mostly choose A (80%). Options B, C, and D might see 5-6% each due to minor oversights.
- **Advanced**: These students are highly likely to choose A (95%) as they understand BIDMAS and can apply it accurately. The remaining 5% might be split among B, C, and D due to very minor errors or overcomplicating the expression.

## 6: Assign percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=20%, B=10%, C=10%, D=60%
- **Basic**: A=40%, B=15%, C=15%, D=30%
- **Proficient**: A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%
- **Advanced**: A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
