## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to compare the values of two expressions: \(8+12 \div 4\) and \((8+12) \div 4\), and determine the correct symbol that belongs in the box between them.

## 2: Evaluating the Expressions
First, let's evaluate the expressions correctly using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).
- For \(8+12 \div 4\): Following BODMAS, we do division first, so \(12 \div 4 = 3\), then \(8 + 3 = 11\).
- For \((8+12) \div 4\): Following BODMAS, we do the operation inside the parentheses first, so \(8 + 12 = 20\), then \(20 \div 4 = 5\).

## 3: Comparing the Expressions
Comparing the two results: \(11\) for \(8+12 \div 4\) and \(5\) for \((8+12) \div 4\), it's clear that \(11 > 5\), so the correct symbol to use is \(>\).

## 4: Analyzing Potential Errors
- A common error is to ignore the order of operations. For example, calculating \(8 + 12 \div 4\) as \(20 \div 4 = 5\), which would incorrectly suggest \(=\).
- Another error could be misinterpreting the expressions or making calculation mistakes.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often struggle with basic arithmetic and the order of operations. They might calculate \(8+12 \div 4\) as \(20 \div 4 = 5\) (error in following order of operations) and \((8+12) \div 4\) as \(20 \div 4 = 5\), leading them to think \(C) =\) is correct. Some might not even attempt to calculate and guess. Given their struggles, \(C) =\) might be a common choice due to incorrect calculation or lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp of arithmetic but might still make mistakes with the order of operations. They might correctly calculate one expression but not the other or make simple arithmetic errors. They could be tempted by \(C) =\) if they mistakenly think the expressions are equal due to calculation errors.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the order of operations and can calculate both expressions correctly. They should see that \(8+12 \div 4 = 11\) and \((8+12) \div 4 = 5\), leading them to choose \(A) >\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only calculate correctly but also understand the underlying mathematical principles. They will easily see that \(11 > 5\), confirming \(A) >\).

## 6: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: Given their struggles, let's estimate \(A=20\%\) (some get it right by chance or correct calculation), \(B=10\%\) (think the second expression is larger), \(C=60\%\) (think they are equal due to incorrect calculations), and \(D=10\%\) (either don't know or make a mistake).
- **Basic**: Here, \(A=50\%\) (correct calculation), \(B=20\%\) (incorrectly think the second is larger), \(C=25\%\) (think they are equal), and \(D=5\%\) (confused or guessing).
- **Proficient**: For proficient students, \(A=80\%\) (correct), \(B=10\%\) (mistake), \(C=5\%\) (rare mistake), and \(D=5\%\) (overly cautious or confused).
- **Advanced**: These students should largely choose \(A\), so \(A=95\%\), \(B=3\%\), \(C=1\%\), and \(D=1\%\).

## 7: Finalizing Predictions
Given 200 papers and assuming a distribution across levels:
- Let's assume 20% below basic, 30% basic, 30% proficient, and 20% advanced for simplicity.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
