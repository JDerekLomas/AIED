## Step 1: Understanding the question and possible errors
The question requires students to substitute \( k = -3 \) into the equation \( T = k^4 \) and solve for \( T \). The correct calculation is \( T = (-3)^4 = 81 \). To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who chose each option, we need to consider common errors.

## 2: Identifying common errors for each option
- Option A: \( 81 \) is the correct answer, which comes from \( (-3)^4 = 81 \). This requires understanding of even exponents making negative bases positive.
- Option B: \( 12 \) could result from a calculation error, but it's not immediately clear how one would get 12 directly from \( (-3)^4 \) without a specific mistake.
- Option C: \( -81 \) might result from \( -3^4 \), confusing the order of operations or forgetting the parentheses around the -3.
- Option D: \( -12 \) seems unlikely as a direct result of a simple mistake in \( (-3)^4 \).

## 3: Analyzing specific calculation errors
- A common error leading to Option C (\( -81 \)) is when students calculate \( -3^4 \) instead of \( (-3)^4 \), essentially doing \( -(3^4) \) which equals \( -81 \).
- For Option B (\( 12 \)), one might consider \( (-3) \times 4 = -12 \) or other misapplications, but directly getting 12 from \( k^4 \) with \( k = -3 \) isn't straightforward without a very specific miscalculation.
- Option D (\( -12 \)) doesn't directly follow from common errors in exponentiation.

## 4: Considering the attractiveness of wrong answers and student ability levels
- Students who are below basic might not fully understand exponent rules and could easily fall into traps like calculating \( -3^4 \) (leading to C) or might not know how to handle \( (-3)^4 \) correctly.
- Basic students might understand the concept of even powers resulting in a positive number but could still make careless mistakes, like not properly handling the negative sign.
- Proficient students are likely to understand that \( (-3)^4 = 81 \), but might still make minor careless errors.
- Advanced students are expected to have a strong grasp of these concepts and are less likely to make simple errors.

## 5: Predicting percentages based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to struggle with the concept. They might choose C (\( -81 \)) because it's a straightforward mistake (\( -3^4 \)), and some might choose B or D due to confusion or incorrect calculations. A (\( 81 \)) seems unlikely for many, so let's predict: A=20% (those who somehow got it right or guessed), B=15% (simple incorrect calculations), C=55% (common mistake), D=10%.
- **Basic**: These students have a foundational understanding but might still make mistakes. Let's predict: A=60% (understand the concept), B=10% (careless or simple errors), C=25% (common mistake), D=5%.
- **Proficient**: Students here are expected to mostly get it right. Let's predict: A=90% (strong understanding), B=5% (minor errors), C=4% (some still fall into common traps), D=1%.
- **Advanced**: These students should nearly all get it right. Let's predict: A=98% (excellent understanding), B=1%, C=1%, D=0%.

## 6: Finalizing predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
- basic: A=60% B=10% C=25% D=5%
- proficient: A=90% B=5% C=4% D=1%
- advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
