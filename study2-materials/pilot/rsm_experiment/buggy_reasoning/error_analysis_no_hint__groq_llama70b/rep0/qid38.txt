below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=5% C=20% D=35%
proficient: A=70% B=2% C=5% D=23%
advanced: A=90% B=1% C=2% D=7% 

Note: The prediction is based on the assumption that below_basic students are more likely to guess or make random errors, basic students may attempt the question but are prone to simple errors like not finding a common denominator, proficient students are more methodical but might still overlook simple details, and advanced students are very unlikely to make calculation errors and are more careful with their work. 

The attractive wrong answer, \( \frac{7}{2x} \) (D), arises from adding the numerators directly without properly combining the fractions, or incorrectly finding a common denominator. Another attractive mistake could be simply adding the fractions as they are without changing the denominators, leading to some students incorrectly choosing options that resemble such operations. The correct method involves finding a common denominator and then adding the fractions, making option A the correct choice.
