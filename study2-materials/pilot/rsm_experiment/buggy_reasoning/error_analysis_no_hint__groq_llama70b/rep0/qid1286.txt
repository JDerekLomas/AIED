Based on my experience, I predict the following percentages for each ability level:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%

My reasoning is as follows:
- Option B is an attractive option because it incorrectly places the pi term as a denominator outside the cube root, which might feel intuitive to students unfamiliar with the formula. A common calculation error might involve simply swapping the places of constants without fully considering the formula for the volume of a sphere, \( V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \), and its rearrangement to solve for \( r \). 
- Option D represents another common error where students might attempt to "distribute" the cube root across the terms within the formula or misunderstand the rearrangement process.
- Students at the proficient and advanced levels are more likely to double-check their work and apply the formula correctly, thus mostly selecting option A, which correctly solves for the radius: \( r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}} \). 
- Below basic and basic level students are more likely to make errors in calculation or applying the formula, hence the higher percentages for incorrect options.
