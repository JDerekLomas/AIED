below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

Note: The attractive error here often involves forgetting that an even power of a negative number results in a positive number, or mistakenly applying rules related to odd powers. The calculation error leading to option C, for example, would be forgetting to recognize that \( k^{4} \) is positive regardless of \( k \) being negative. More proficient and advanced students are less likely to fall into such traps due to their stronger grasp of exponent rules, while below basic and basic students might confuse these rules or apply them inconsistently.
