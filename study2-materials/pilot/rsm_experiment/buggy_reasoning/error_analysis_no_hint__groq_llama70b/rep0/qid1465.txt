To predict the percentages at each ability level, let's analyze the calculation and potential errors:

1. The correct calculation follows the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): First, multiply \(4 \times 2 = 8\), then proceed with the addition and subtraction from left to right, so \(3 - 5 + 8 = 6\).

2. Calculation errors leading to wrong answers:
   - A) \(6\) is the correct answer, achieved by following the order of operations correctly.
   - B) \(4\) could result from a miscalculation or misunderstanding of the operations' order, such as calculating \(3 - 5 = -2\) and then not correctly adding or subtracting the result of \(4 \times 2\).
   - C) \(-12\) could come from incorrectly calculating \(4 \times 2\) or misunderstanding the sign operations, although this seems less direct as an error in calculation from the given equation.
   - D) \(-10\) could result from a simple miscalculation or forgetting to multiply before adding/subtracting, such as \(3 - 5 + 4 = 2\), and then either misinterpreting the multiplication or not performing it.

Given these considerations, here are the predictions for each ability level:

below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=20% D=40%
- Students at this level may struggle with basic arithmetic operations or the order of operations, leading to a variety of incorrect answers.

basic: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
- At this level, students start to understand the basics but may still frequently make mistakes in operation order or arithmetic, with some improvement in recognizing the correct method.

proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- Proficient students are more likely to follow the order of operations correctly and make fewer arithmetic mistakes, thus selecting the correct answer more frequently.

advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
- Advanced students are highly likely to apply the order of operations correctly and double-check their calculations, leading to a high percentage for the correct answer and very low percentages for the incorrect options.

These predictions assume that as the ability level increases, so does the student's mastery of the order of operations and basic arithmetic, leading to fewer calculation errors.
