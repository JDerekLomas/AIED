below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=5% D=3%

Rationale: 
- For the wrong answers, a common calculation error leading to Katie's mistake (B) is adding 5 to both sides without accounting for the division by 3, which feels natural but is incorrect. This is an "attractive" error, especially for lower-ability students. 
- The correct next step, as Tom suggests, involves adding 5 to both sides and then keeping the equation as \( \frac{x}{3} = 17 \), which most students who reach the proficient or advanced level should understand.
- Lower-ability (below_basic, basic) students might be more prone to Katie's mistake due to a misunderstanding of how to apply operations to both sides of an equation when there are coefficients involved.
- As the ability level increases, students are more likely to recognize Tom's method as correct and understand why Katie's method is flawed, thus selecting option A with higher frequency.
