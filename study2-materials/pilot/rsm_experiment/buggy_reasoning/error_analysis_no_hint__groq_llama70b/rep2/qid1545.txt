To predict the percentages, let's break down the calculation and the potential traps in the question.

The correct calculation following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) is:
1. Divide 12 by 4: \(12 \div 4 = 3\)
2. Add 8 to the result: \(8 + 3 = 11\)

So, \(8 + 12 \div 4 = 11\).

Now, calculating the expression in the parentheses first:
1. Add 8 and 12: \(8 + 12 = 20\)
2. Divide the result by 4: \(20 \div 4 = 5\)

Thus, \((8 + 12) \div 4 = 5\).

Comparing the two results: \(11 > 5\), so the correct answer is A) \(>\).

Predicting the percentages based on common errors:

- **below_basic**: These students may struggle with understanding the order of operations or make basic arithmetic errors. They might not evaluate expressions within parentheses first or might not divide before adding. The attractive error could be ignoring the parentheses or the division, leading to incorrect operations. They might choose A, B, or C due to confusion about the order of operations or simple addition errors. A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
  
- **basic**: Students at this level understand basic arithmetic but might still struggle with applying the order of operations consistently or might misinterpret the symbols. They could see the parentheses and think to calculate \(8+12\) first but then mistakenly apply operations or miscompare the results. However, their errors would be less frequent compared to the below_basic group. The attractive error here could be not following the order of operations correctly. A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
  
- **proficient**: At this level, students are more likely to correctly apply the order of operations and calculate both expressions correctly. The main challenge would be to carefully compare the results and select the correct inequality symbol. The attractive error might be a simple slip in comparison rather than calculation. A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
  
- **advanced**: These students not only perform the calculations correctly but also understand the implications and can quickly compare results. They can easily handle more complex expressions and are less prone to basic arithmetic mistakes or misunderstanding the symbols. A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

So, the prediction is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
