To solve this, let's consider the nature of each option and the type of error or understanding it represents:

A) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{5} \) - This option incorrectly excludes the first number (0) from the sum, which is a misunderstanding of the data set to be used for the calculation.
B) \( 0+1+3+4+7 \div 5 \) - This option is nearly correct but misinterprets the order of operations (it should be \( (0+1+3+4+7) \div 5 \) to follow the correct order of operations).
C) \( \frac{1+3+4+7}{4} \) - This option not only excludes the first number (0) but also calculates the mean as if there were only 4 numbers in total, further compounding the error.
D) None of them - This option requires recognizing that none of the calculations provided correctly represent the formula for the mean of the given set of numbers.

Given these considerations, let's predict based on common errors and understandings:

- **Below Basic**: These students might randomly guess or have significant misconceptions about mathematical operations. They might choose A because it looks like a "mean" calculation but without a clear understanding (A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%).
- **Basic**: Students at this level may start to apply formulas but can be sloppy with details. They might recognize the need for a sum and division but could easily fall for the trap in B or misunderstand the set of numbers, leading to A or C. However, they might also recognize D if they see the mistakes (A=25% B=40% C=15% D=20%).
- **Proficient**: These students generally understand mathematical principles well but can still make careless errors. They are more likely to notice that none of the given calculations correctly represent the mean, particularly because option B is very close to the correct method but doesn't strictly adhere to the order of operations (A=10% B=20% C=5% D=65%).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to thoroughly understand and apply mathematical concepts accurately. They will quickly recognize the mistake in each of the calculation options (excluding the correct understanding of mean calculation), thus heavily favoring D (A=5% B=10% C=0% D=85%).

So, responding in the requested format:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=20% C=5% D=65%
advanced: A=5% B=10% C=0% D=85%
