To solve this equation, a student would need to isolate \(p\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(p\) and then dividing both sides by \(10\), resulting in \(p = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5\). This straightforward calculation leads to option A as the correct answer. However, specific calculation errors could lead to the other options.

Option B (\(p = 50\)) could result from a mistake where a student multiplies \(10\) by \(p\) and then mistakenly solves for \(p\) as if the equation was \(10p = 5\), which leads to \(p = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5\) but if they mistakenly add a zero to the numerator (thinking of it as \(5 \times 10\)), they might arrive at \(50\). 

Option C (\(p = 2\)) could arise if a student inverts the fraction incorrectly during the solving process. For instance, if a student starts by multiplying both sides by \(p\), resulting in \(10p = 5\), and then mistakenly divides both sides by \(5\) instead of \(10\) to solve for \(p\), they get \(p = \frac{10}{5} = 2\). This specific process error could lead students to choose option C.

Considering the attractiveness of the errors and the self-correcting abilities of students at different levels:

- **Below Basic**: These students are likely to struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and thus might scatter across incorrect options, perhaps with a slight inclination towards options that seem simplistically derived from the equation. 
  - A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%

- **Basic**: They are more likely to attempt standard operations but may fail to correctly execute them, often falling into traps like those described. The error leading to option B might seem particularly attractive due to the multiplication operation.
  - A=40% B=40% C=15% D=5%

- **Proficient**: These students understand the algebraic process well but might occasionally misapply or misinterpret it, especially under time pressure. The calculation errors leading to wrong options are less likely to attract them, but if distracted, they might fall into simple inversion mistakes or misplacing decimals.
  - A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%

- **Advanced**: Advanced students have a solid grasp of algebraic manipulation and are likely to solve the equation correctly with a high degree of accuracy. They less frequently fall into the traps that lead to the wrong answers and are also more likely to double-check their work to identify and correct any simple errors.
  - A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%

Thus, based on the specific calculation errors and the propensity of students at different levels to either commit these errors or catch themselves:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=40% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
