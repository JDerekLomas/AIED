To predict the percentage at each ability level who chose each option, I'll analyze the specific calculation error that leads to each wrong answer and consider which errors are "attractive" and who might catch themselves versus fall into the trap.

The correct answer is \( -4 \) because multiplying the two terms indicated by the arrows involves multiplying \(-1\) by \(-4\), which yields \( +4\), but since both terms are negative, the correct operation between them (multiplication of two negatives) yields a positive result. However, it seems I approached the explanation with the outcome in mind, which is actually incorrect based on the standard procedure of multiplying two negative numbers together, which indeed gives a positive. The confusion here might stem from misunderstanding the question's aim. The correct calculation is simply \((-1) \times (-4) = +4\).

Given this correction, let's reevaluate:

- **Option A (+4)** is actually the correct answer because \((-1) \times (-4) = +4\). Attractive errors often involve misinterpreting signs or operations.
- **Option B (\(-4\))** would be a result of forgetting that two negatives make a positive. This is a common mistake, especially among students who are not thoroughly familiar with the rules of signs in multiplication.
- **Options C (+5) and D (\(-5\))** don't directly relate to common multiplication mistakes in this context but could result from random errors or misunderstandings not directly related to the signs or the operation itself.

Given this analysis, I would estimate as follows, recognizing that my initial setup was flawed, and correcting it with the actual proper understanding of the operation involved:

below_basic: A=20% B=50% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%

These estimates reflect an understanding that more able students (proficient and advanced) are less likely to fall into simple trap errors like incorrect sign handling and that less able students (below basic and basic) might struggle more with these concepts, leaning towards attractively simple (but wrong) calculations or guesses.
