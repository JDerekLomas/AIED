Below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
Basic: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%
Proficient: A=90% B=5% C=4% D=1%
Advanced: A=95% B=3% D=2% C=0%

Note: The prediction is based on the assumption that below_basic students are more prone to random guessing or not understanding the question, basic students might struggle with the algebra but have some intuition, proficient students are likely to apply the correct method but might sometimes slip into attractive errors, and advanced students consistently apply correct methods. 

In this case, Tom's method is correct as he is adding 5 to both sides to isolate the fraction, a standard step in solving linear equations. Katie's suggestion to multiply both sides by 3 and then subtract 5 is incorrect because it doesn't correctly reverse the operations applied to x. The common error here is not realizing that in Katie's suggested step, the subtraction of 5 on the left side doesn't get 'canceled' or moved to the right side simply by multiplying both sides by 3. Tom's correct step involves a straightforward addition to both sides to begin isolating x, making it less error-prone for those with a solid grip on algebraic manipulations.
