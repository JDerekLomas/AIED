Note: The predictions are based on common errors and attractive mistakes. Option B is the correct answer and is expected to be chosen by the majority of students, with the percentage increasing as the ability level increases. 

Option A is an attractive mistake for students who forget to divide by 3 when solving for p. Option D may be chosen by students who misinterpret the division as multiplication. Option C is an unlikely mistake, but some struggling students may choose it due to a complete misunderstanding of the equation. 

As the ability level increases, the percentage of students choosing the correct answer (B) also increases, while the percentage choosing incorrect options decreases.
