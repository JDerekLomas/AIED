Note: The attractive error here is in the calculation of the middle term, often leading to B) \( m^{2}-12 m+35 \), because students forget to subtract the product of the two constants from the sum of the products of the outer and inner terms, or incorrectly calculate this part, leading to either the coefficient being incorrect (in this case -12) or the constants being incorrectly added instead of subtracted. Students who fall into the trap tend to forget the proper order of operations and the distributive property application in multiplying out brackets.
