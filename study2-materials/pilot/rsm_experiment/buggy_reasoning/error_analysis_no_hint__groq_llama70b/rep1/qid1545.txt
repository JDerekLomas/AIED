To solve this, let's first calculate both expressions correctly, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

1. \(8 + 12 \div 4\):
   - First, divide 12 by 4: \(12 \div 4 = 3\)
   - Then, add 8 and 3: \(8 + 3 = 11\)

2. \((8 + 12) \div 4\):
   - First, add 8 and 12 inside the parentheses: \(8 + 12 = 20\)
   - Then, divide 20 by 4: \(20 \div 4 = 5\)

So, \(8 + 12 \div 4 = 11\) and \((8 + 12) \div 4 = 5\).

Thus, \(11 > 5\), meaning the correct symbol to fill in the box is \(>\), which corresponds to option A.

Considering common errors and attractive wrong methods:
- A common mistake would be to not follow the order of operations correctly, especially for those who are used to simply performing operations from left to right.
- Calculating \((8 + 12) \div 4\) first might seem like the straightforward approach if one overlooks the implications of the order of operations in the first expression, potentially leading to confusion.

Given these considerations, here's a prediction based on ability levels:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%

This prediction considers that more able students are less likely to fall into traps related to the order of operations and are more likely to recognize and apply the correct principles, whereas less able students may be more prone to errors related to these concepts.
