To predict the percentages, let's first determine the correct calculation:
\[y=3 x^{2}\]
\[y=3 \times (0.3)^{2}\]
\[y=3 \times 0.09\]
\[y=0.27\]

So, the correct answer is B) \(0.27\).

Now, let's analyze the potential errors:

- Option A) \(0.81\) might result from calculating \(3 \times 0.3\) instead of \(3 \times (0.3)^{2}\), or misunderstanding the order of operations.
- Option C) \(1.8\) could result from calculating \(3 \times 0.3 \times 2\) or simply \(3 \times 0.6\), but there's no clear straightforward mistake leading directly to this answer from the given equation, making it less "attractive" as a wrong choice.
- Option D) \(2.7\) doesn't directly relate to a common mistake in this specific calculation.

Given this, the "attractive" errors (feeling natural) are mostly related to misunderstandings of exponentiation or the order of operations, which often affect students who are not entirely comfortable with algebraic manipulations or applying formulas correctly.

Here's the prediction:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=50% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%

These predictions assume that:
- Below basic students are more likely to guess or apply incorrect operations, spreading their answers more evenly across options, with perhaps a slight bias towards Option A due to the mistake of ignoring the square.
- Basic students will start to show more understanding, with most applying the formula correctly (Option B), but a significant portion still falling for the attractive error (Option A).
- Proficient students will exhibit a good grasp of the formula, with most choosing the correct answer and fewer being misled by calculation errors.
- Advanced students demonstrate a strong understanding, with the vast majority selecting the correct answer and almost none making basic computational mistakes.
