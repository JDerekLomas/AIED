below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%

Note: The correct answer is A) 6, as the correct order of operations yields: 3 - 5 + 4 * 2 = 3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6. 

The calculation error leading to each wrong answer is as follows:
- B) 4: This could result from calculations like 3 - 5 = -2, then not multiplying 4 by 2 or misunderstanding the final sum.
- C) -12: This could result from incorrectly multiplying first (without following the correct order of operations), or misunderstanding the signs in the calculation.
- D) -10: This might occur due to errors like forgetting to multiply, or getting signs wrong. 

Options B, C, and D might attract students who misunderstand the order of operations or struggle with carrying out the arithmetic correctly. Students at the below_basic and basic levels might be more prone to falling into these traps due to struggles with applying the order of operations or general arithmetic. The proficient and advanced students are more likely to catch and correct their own mistakes or apply the correct method from the start.
