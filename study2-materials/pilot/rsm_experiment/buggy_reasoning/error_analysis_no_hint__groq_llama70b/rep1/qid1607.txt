To solve the equation \(15 = \frac{1+k}{4}\), the correct steps involve first multiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction, which leads to \(60 = 1 + k\). Then, subtracting 1 from both sides to isolate \(k\), resulting in \(59 = k\). 

Given these correct steps, let's analyze the predicted percentages based on common errors and attractive mistakes for each ability level:

- **Below Basic**: These students often struggle with applying basic mathematical operations correctly and may not fully understand the concept of solving equations. They might find multiplying and then adding/subtracting in the correct steps challenging.
  - A) Only step 1: This choice might attract students who understand the multiplication part but are weak in applying the correct subsequent steps.
  - B) Only step 2: This could be an "attractive" error for those who try to adjust the wrong initial calculation to fit the expected format of the solution.
  - C) Both steps are correct: Many might randomly guess or assume both are correct due to not fully understanding or checking their work.
  - D) Both steps are incorrect: Those who notice the final value doesn't match expectations might choose this, realizing something went wrong, even if not exactly sure what.

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a firmer grasp on basic algebraic manipulations but can still fall into attractive errors or fail to check their work thoroughly.
  - A) Only step 1: Students in this category might see that the step involving multiplication is correct, recognizing it as a common method to eliminate fractions.
  - B) Only step 2: Less likely to be chosen, as the direct transition from given equation to the solution doesn't feel natural unless there's a calculation mistake.
  - C) Both steps are correct: They might assume that both steps lead to a plausible solution without closely evaluating each step.
  - D) Both steps are incorrect: More able to recognize incorrect steps upon reflection, especially if encouraged to check work.

basic: A=30% B=5% C=40% D=25%

- **Proficient**: Students here have a clearer understanding of solving linear equations but might make calculation errors under time pressure or if not paying close attention.
  - A) Only step 1: Recognizing that the first step is necessary for solving the equation and understanding why the second step could be incorrect.
  - B) Only step 2: Less common, as the step doesn't follow naturally without a clear preceding operation indicating \(k\) should be \(61\).
  - C) Both steps are correct: They know both steps lead to solutions but must catch if any of the arithmetic or steps are incorrect.
  - D) Both steps are incorrect: Given that the first step to multiply by 4 is generally understood to eliminate the fraction, and if the subsequent calculation error is noted, this could be a reasonable conclusion.

proficient: A=55% B=5% C=20% D=20%

- **Advanced**: Students are skilled in equation solving and tend to identify the mistake and choose based on clear logic, understanding both the mathematical principles and the nature of the error.
  - A) Only step 1: Clearly identifying that multiplying to eliminate the fraction is correct.
  - B) Only step 2: Not a common choice since \(61\) does not correctly follow from the step before it, assuming the correct initial calculation was applied.
  - C) Both steps are correct: Only chosen if the student didn't properly identify the specific arithmetic or logical error in one or both steps.
  - D) Both steps are incorrect: Unlikely if they recognized the initial operation was correct, focusing then on the following step where an error leads to \(k = 61\) instead of \(k = 59\).

advanced: A=80% B=0% C=5% D=15%
