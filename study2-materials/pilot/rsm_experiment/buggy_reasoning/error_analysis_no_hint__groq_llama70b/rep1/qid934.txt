To solve this problem, students need to substitute \( x = 0 \) into the equation \( 4x + 2y = 10 \) to find \( y \). The correct calculation is \( 4(0) + 2y = 10 \), which simplifies to \( 2y = 10 \), and therefore \( y = 5 \). This means the correct answer is C) \( 5 \).

Given the nature of the question and the common pitfalls in algebraic manipulations at the Year 9 level, here are the predicted percentages for each ability level:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
- Students at this level may struggle with algebra altogether, making attractive errors such as calculating \( y \) as if \( x \) was already given or misunderstanding the equation structure. Option D might come from a mistaken division or other arithmetical confusion.

basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
- Basic level students should recognize the need to substitute \( x = 0 \) into the equation but may make calculation errors or misinterpret the equation, leading to options A, B, or D. The higher percentage for C indicates an understanding of the algebraic process, even if not consistently applied.

proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- Proficient students are more likely to correctly substitute \( x = 0 \) into the equation and solve for \( y \) without error. They may only occasionally slip into calculation errors, resulting in the low percentages for incorrect options.

advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
- Advanced students are highly likely to solve this problem correctly due to their strong algebraic skills and attention to detail. The small percentage for D could reflect a rare moment of inattention or a minor calculation oversight rather than a fundamental misunderstanding.

These predictions are based on common mistakes and thought processes of students at different ability levels.
