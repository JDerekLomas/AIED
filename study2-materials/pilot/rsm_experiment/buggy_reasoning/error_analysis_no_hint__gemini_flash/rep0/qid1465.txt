In this Year 9 mock, the most significant hurdle is the application of BIDMAS (Order of Operations), specifically the common misconception that addition must occur before subtraction.

**Mental Models and Errors:**
*   **The Correct Route (A):** $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 + 8$. Working left-to-right from here gives $-2 + 8 = 6$.
*   **The "Addition First" Trap (B):** A classic error. Students see "A" before "S" in BIDMAS and perform $5 + 4 = 9$, leading to $3 - 9 \times 2$ or more commonly $3 - (5 + 4 \times 2) \to 3 - (5+8) = -10$. However, many will do $3 - 5 + 8$ but treat the addition first: $3 - (5 + 8) = 3 - 13 = -10$, or more simply, calculate $3 - 5 = -2$ then $(-2) + 8 = 6$. The most common path to **B (4)** is linear calculation: $(3 - 5) = -2$; $(-2 + 4) = 2$; $2 \times 2 = 4$. This "reading like a book" error is very common in lower sets.
*   **The Multiplication Mis-step (C/D):** **C (-12)** often comes from linear calculation with a sign error: $3-5 = -2$; $-2+4 = 2$... wait, many do $3-5-4 = -6 \times 2 = -12$. **D (-10)** is the primary "distractor" for those who know BIDMAS but apply it too rigidly (Addition before Subtraction: $5+8=13$, then $3-13 = -10$).
