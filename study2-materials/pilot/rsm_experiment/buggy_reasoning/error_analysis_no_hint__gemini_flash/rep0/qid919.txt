To predict the performance for this specific non-calculator Year 9 question, we look at the specific mathematical misconceptions triggered by $y = 3x^2$ when $x = 0.3$:

*   **Distractor A (0.81):** The "Order of Operations" error. Students calculate $(3x)^2$ instead of $3(x^2)$. They do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$, then $0.9^2 = 0.81$. This is very attractive to students who have a weak grasp of BIDMAS/BODMAS.
*   **Distractor B (0.27):** **The Correct Answer.** $0.3^2 = 0.09$, then $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$.
*   **Distractor C (1.8):** The "Square is Double" error. Students do $0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$ (misinterpreting $x^2$ as $2x$), then $0.6 \times 3 = 1.8$. 
*   **Distractor D (2.7):** The "Decimal Point" error. Students correctly identify $3 \times 3^2 = 27$ but struggle with the place value of $0.3^2$, mistakenly thinking it is $0.9$ rather than $0.09$.

Below is the predicted percentage breakdown based on common Year 9 mock exam trends:

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=15% B=65% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=92% C=0% D=3%
