To arrive at these percentages, I’ve considered the following common Year 9 pitfalls:

*   **Option D (The "Adder"):** This is the classic novice error—adding the numerators (7+1=8) and the denominators (10+4=14). Below-basic students gravitate toward this because it feels "logical" and avoids the need for a common denominator.
*   **Option B (The Correct Answer):** Requires finding the lowest common multiple (20), converting the fractional parts ($14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20$), and adding the whole numbers ($2+2=4$).
*   **Option A (The "Missed Instruction"):** This represents the correct value but ignores the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number." Students who convert everything to improper fractions first ($27/10 + 9/4$) often get $99/20$ and forget to convert back. Proficient students often fall into this "processing trap."
*   **Option C (Common Denominator Error):** This results from a student multiplying the denominators to get 40 but forgetting to adjust the numerators proportionally, or a simple miscalculation while working with improper fractions.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=25% D=50%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=25% B=70% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=5% B=95% C=0% D=0%
