To predict the results for this Year 9 question, we must look at the two common misconceptions: the **operation error** (adding the numbers instead of multiplying) and the **directed number error** (failing to handle the negative multiplied by a negative).

*   **Option A (+4):** The correct answer. Students must correctly identify multiplication and the rule that $(-1) \times (-4) = +4$.
*   **Option B (-4):** The "half-way" mistake. The student knows to multiply but forgets that two negatives make a positive. This is highly attractive to middle-attaining students.
*   **Option C (+5):** The "additive" mistake. The student sees $-1$ and $-4$ and instinctively adds them (ignoring signs or thinking of magnitude) or perhaps subtracts $-1 - 4$ but gets lost.
*   **Option D (-5):** The most common lower-ability error. Students see "expand" but ignore the specific operation of multiplication for these terms, instead simply combining the constants: $-1 - 4 = -5$.

Here is the predicted distribution based on typical UK Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=35% B=30% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=65% B=25% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=1% D=0%
