To predict these percentages, I’ve considered the following common pitfalls I see in Year 9 mock exams:

1.  **The Formula Recall Trap:** Many students remember $4/3$ and $\pi$ but struggle with the algebraic manipulation. They often multiply by $4$ and divide by $3$ instinctively because $4$ is "on top" in their memory. This makes **Option A** highly attractive.
2.  **The Fractional Division Muddle:** To get to the correct answer (**Option C**), you must multiply by $3$ and divide by $4\pi$. Students often move one part of the fraction correctly but leave the other, or forget that $\pi$ stays in the denominator with the $4$.
3.  **The "Cubing Everything" Error:** **Option D** represents a student who understands they need a cube root but lacks the algebraic fluency to keep it over the entire expression, or mistakenly thinks they need to divide $V$ by $4\pi$ before cube-rooting, then forgets how fractions work.

**below_basic:** These students are often guessing based on which expression looks "most like" the volume formula or are overwhelmed by the algebra.
**basic:** These students usually know the volume formula but fail at the first step of rearranging (multiplying by the denominator).
**proficient:** These students know they need to "get rid" of $3$, but some will still divide by $3$ instead of multiplying, or fail to move $\pi$ correctly.
**advanced:** These students routinely check their steps or test the result by substituting back into $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=3% C=91% D=1%
