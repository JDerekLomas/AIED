To determine the correct answer, we substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$. This simplifies to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, leading to $x = 3.3$ (**C**).

Here is the breakdown of the distractors based on typical Year 9 errors:
*   **A (4.25):** The "Addition Error." Students substitute $0.5$ correctly but calculate $6 \times 0.5$ as $1.5$ (mistaking half of 6 for 1.5 or dividing 6 by 4). Or, they reach $10x = 30 + 12.5$ through various coefficient miscalculations.
*   **D (2.7):** The "Subtraction Error." This is the most "attractive" trap. Students calculate $10x - 3 = 30$ but mistakenly subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it, leading to $10x = 27$ and $x = 2.7$.
*   **B (-4.25):** The "Sign and Arithmetic Error." Usually chosen by lower-ability students struggling with the movement of terms across the equals sign and negative numbers.
