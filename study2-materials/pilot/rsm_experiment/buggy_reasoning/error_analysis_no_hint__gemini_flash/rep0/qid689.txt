Having marked hundreds of these, this is a classic "variable in the denominator" trap. 

Students at lower ability levels almost always perform a "multiplication reflex"—seeing the 10 and the 5 and assuming they must be multiplied (Option B) or subtracted (not listed). Many see $10 = 5 \div p$ and subconsciously flip it to $p = 10 \div 5$ (Option C) because it results in a whole number, which feels "correct" in a non-calculator paper. Option A is the mathematically sound result ($5/10$), but it is "unintuitive" because the smaller number is being divided by the larger one. 

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=40% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=28% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
