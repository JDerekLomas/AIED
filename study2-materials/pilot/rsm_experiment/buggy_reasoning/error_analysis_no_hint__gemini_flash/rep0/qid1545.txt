In this Year 9 mock, this question is a classic test of **Order of Operations (BIDMAS)**. 

The left-hand side ($8 + 12 \div 4$) is frequently miscalculated by weaker students as $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 5$, reading left-to-right. More capable students identify that division comes first: $8 + 3 = 11$. 

The right-hand side is clearly 5 due to the brackets. 
The comparison is $11 > 5$. 

*   **Option C (Equal)** is the most common error: students calculate $20 \div 4$ on both sides, assuming the brackets are just "for show" or following a purely left-to-right logic.
*   **Option B (Less Than)** is chosen by students who correctly calculate the RHS as 5, but then calculate the LHS as 5 and think the brackets somehow make the RHS larger or simply click the wrong symbol.
*   **Option D (Greater than or equal to)** is a "distractor" for students who feel the numbers look related but aren't confident in the strict inequality.

Here are the predicted percentages based on 200 Year 9 papers:

below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
