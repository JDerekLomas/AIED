Having marked 200 of these scripts tonight, the most common pitfall for the "Below Basic" group isn't necessarily the addition of the numerators, but the instinctive "addition" of the denominators—a very "natural" but incorrect feeling. Many "Proficient" students will successfully calculate the answer but fail to follow the specific instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number," falling for the improper fraction trap. 

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=35% B=5% C=15% D=45%
basic: A=65% B=15% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=18% C=0% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
