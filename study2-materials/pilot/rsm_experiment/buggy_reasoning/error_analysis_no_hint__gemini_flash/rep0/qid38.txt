To simplify $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator. The correct approach is $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$ (**A**).

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** This is the classic "add across" error. Students add the numerators ($3+4=7$) and add the denominators ($2x+x=3x$). This is the most common mistake for low-ability students.
*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** Students recognise that $2x$ is a suitable denominator but fail to adjust the numerator of the second fraction. They simply add the original numerators ($3+4=7$) over the common denominator.
*   **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** A less common mechanical error where a student might multiply the first fraction correctly but somehow lose the '2' in the denominator or divide by 2 at the wrong step.
