Having marked hundreds of these papers, this is a classic "trapped zero" question. It tests three distinct things: the inclusion of zero in the denominator count, the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS), and the correct notation for fractions vs. linear division.

**Error Analysis:**
*   **A (The Trap):** This is the most common answer. Students correctly identify that they need to divide by 5, but their instinct is that adding 0 is "pointless," so they leave it out of the numerator string. This is the "high-utility" mistake for Basic/Proficient students.
*   **B (The BIDMAS Error):** This is incredibly common. Students write exactly what they would type into a standard scientific calculator without using brackets or the fraction button. Only \(7 \div 5\) happens first. 
*   **C (The Denominator Error):** Students see four "actual" numbers and think they should divide by 4. 
*   **D (The Correct Answer):** This is difficult for students because "None of them" feels like a trick. To pick D, they must realize that A is technically correct in value but poorly expressed (though many teachers accept it, strictly speaking, the 0 belongs in the sum), OR more likely, they see that B lacks brackets and A/C have "something wrong" with the count.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=25% B=45% C=25% D=5%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=55% B=15% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=20% B=5% C=0% D=75%
