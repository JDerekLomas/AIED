Having marked several hundred of these scripts, this question is a classic "procedural trap." Many students see the 3 and the 12 and immediately think of the relationship $12 \div 3 = 4$, rather than the correct operation of dividing a fraction by an integer.

Here is the breakdown of the common errors:
- **A ($p = 1/4$):** The most common mistake. Students intuitively divide 12 by 3 to get 4, but leave it in the denominator because the 12 was in the denominator.
- **B (Correct):** Students multiply both sides by $1/3$ or correctly divide $1/12$ by 3.
- **C ($p = 4$):** Students ignore the fraction structure entirely or perform $12 \div 3$ and "bring it up" to the top.
- **D ($p = 1/9$):** A rarer error where students might misread the 12 as a 3 or try to square/triple the numerator.
