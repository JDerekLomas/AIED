To predict these percentages, I have analysed the common pitfalls for Year 9 students:

*   **Option B (Correct):** Requires correctly identifying that $-5 \times -7 = +35$ and $-5 - 7 = -12$.
*   **Option A:** This is a classic "difference" error. Students find the difference between 5 and 7 instead of summing them, or they get muddled with the $-5 + (-7)$ calculation.
*   **Option C:** A sign error where the student knows it's $12m$ and $35$, but ignores the negative signs entirely (the "everything is positive" instinct).
*   **Option D:** The most common "middle-ability" error. Students correctly sum to $-12$, but apply the "positive and negative make a negative" rule to the multiplication incorrectly, forgetting that a negative times a negative is a positive.

**below_basic:** These students often struggle with directed numbers and the distributive property. They frequently pick C because they ignore signs, or A because they guess based on the numbers appearing in the question.
**basic:** These students know to use "FOIL" or a grid but almost always fail the "negative x negative = positive" rule, making D very attractive.
**proficient:** These students generally handle the expansion well but may make a hurried arithmetic slip with the middle term (Option A).
**advanced:** These students have internalised the rules for directed numbers; any errors here are usually purely clerical.

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=10% B=75% C=05% D=10%
advanced: A=02% B=95% C=01% D=02%
