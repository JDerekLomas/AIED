In this common Year 9 linear equations question, the primary "trap" is the transition from Step 1 to Step 2. Many students perform Step 1 correctly (multiplying by 4) but then fail to apply the inverse operation in Step 2. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 to isolate $k$, they "move" the 1 over and instinctively add it to the 60, resulting in 61. 

Students at the lower end of the ability spectrum often see "61" and assume the logic is sound because 60 and 1 are involved. High-ability students identify the sign error in Step 2 immediately.
