Here is the predicted breakdown based on common misconceptions found in Year 9 mock papers, specifically looking at the 'Order of Operations' trap.

### Teacher's Note on Common Errors:
*   **The "BIDMAS" Trap (Problems C & D):** Many students take "A before S" (Addition before Subtraction) in the BIDMAS acronym too literally. They believe they *must* calculate $5+6$ first in Problem P, despite the rule that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right.
*   **Reading Left-to-Right (Problem A):** Below-basic students often ignore priority rules entirely and simply calculate whatever they see first.
*   **The "Natural Break" (Problem B):** This is the correct approach. Proficient students understand left-to-right for Problem P and multiplication priority for Problem Q.

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=65% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
