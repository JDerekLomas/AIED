To determine these percentages, I have considered the common pitfalls for Year 9 students when dealing with equations in the form $ax + by = c$:

*   **Option C (5) is the most attractive "easy" trap.** Students see $x=0$, ignore the $4x$ term entirely, but then see "10" and "2" and divide $10 \div 2$. 
*   **Option B (3) represents a "balance" error.** Some students substitute $x=0$ correctly to get $2y = 10$, but then perform an incorrect inverse operation or "guess and check" incorrectly, or more likely, they mix up the equation with $4+2y=10$ or similar.
*   **Option A (20) is a multiplication error.** Students see $4(0)$ but somehow think they must multiply the 10 by the 2 because they are "moving" the 2.
*   **Option D (2.5)** comes from students dividing 10 by 4, completely ignoring the $2y$.

**Predicting the Year 9 Mock distribution:**

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=65% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=97% D=1%
