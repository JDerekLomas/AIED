In marking this particular Year 9 question, I've observed several distinct patterns:
- **The "Flip" (Option D):** This is the most common error for students who know division becomes a fraction but forget that the dividend ($c$) must be the numerator. 
- **The "BODMAS Confusion" (Option C):** Many students at the basic level view the $+4$ as a separate entity from the division, effectively ignoring the brackets.
- **The "Distributive Mix-up" (Option B):** This occurs when a student thinks they need to apply the $c$ to every term within the expression, similar to expanding a bracket, often because they see $+4$ as a loose value that needs its own "letter part."

Here is the predicted distribution based on standard Year 9 mock results:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=35% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=80% B=2% C=3% D=15%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=0% D=2%
