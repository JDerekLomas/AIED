To predict these results, I’ve considered the following common Year 9 pitfalls:
*   **The Sign Trap:** Students often see the negative result and the negative fraction in the question and instinctively think "I need a positive to keep it negative," or they simply forget the rule that a negative multiplied by a positive stays negative.
*   **The Reciprocal vs. Identity Error:** "Basic" students often confuse the additive inverse (changing sign) with the multiplicative inverse (flipping the fraction).
*   **The "Same Number" Fallacy:** Lower-ability students often guess C or D because they recognise the digits in the question and assume the answer must look identical to the components.

**A (4/3):** The most common "strong" error. Students know they need to flip the fraction to get 1, but they lose track of the signs.
**B (-4/3):** The correct answer.
**C (3/4):** Common among students who think multiplication by 1 (or -1) doesn't change the digits, only the sign.
**D (-3/4):** A wild guess or a total misunderstanding of how multiplication affects fractions.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=35% B=55% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=10% B=89% C=1% D=0%
