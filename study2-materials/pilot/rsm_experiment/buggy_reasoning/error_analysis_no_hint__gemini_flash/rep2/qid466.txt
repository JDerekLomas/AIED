To solve this, we must identify that we are looking for the **reciprocal** to result in the identity product. However, the target is $-1$, not $1$. 

**Thinking behind the distractors:**
*   **A ($\frac{4}{3}$):** This is the "trap" answer. Students know they need to "flip" the fraction to get a value of 1, but many ignore the signs. They see one negative already in the question and assume the answer should be positive to keep the total negative. This is the most "attractive" wrong answer.
*   **B ($-\frac{4}{3}$):** The correct mathematical reciprocal. A negative times a negative is a positive, but here the equation equals $-1$. Advanced students will realise that $-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -1$.
*   **C ($\frac{3}{4}$):** Students often confuse multiplication with addition/subtraction rules, thinking they just need to "cancel out" the minus sign.
*   **D ($-\frac{3}{4}$):** This is for students who think the star must be the same as the number already there (confusion with squaring or simply guessing).
