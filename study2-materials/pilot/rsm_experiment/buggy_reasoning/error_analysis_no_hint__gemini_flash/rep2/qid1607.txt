In this equation, Step 1 is correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$). Step 2 is incorrect because the student should subtract 1 from 60 ($k = 59$) but instead added 1.

For "below_basic" students, the tendency is to see the "61" and assume the arithmetic is correct without checking the inverse operation. "Basic" students often recognize the first step of a two-step equation but fall for the "change the side, change the sign" error or simply do what looks natural (adding 1 to 60). "Proficient" students usually identify the sign error in Step 2. "Advanced" students almost universally catch the error.

below_basic: A=15% B=10% C=65% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=2% C=15% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
