Having marked 200 of these, I’ve seen these common pitfalls time and again. 

The primary "trap" here is the handling of the negative sign with an even exponent. Lower-ability students frequently confuse indices with multiplication (leading to 12). Middle-ability students often perform the calculation but assume the answer must be negative because the input was negative (a very common "attractive" error). High-ability students occasionally trip up if they are over-reliant on a scientific calculator and input `-3^4` without brackets, but most at that level have been coached to recognize that a power of 4 always results in a positive real number.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=45% D=15%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
