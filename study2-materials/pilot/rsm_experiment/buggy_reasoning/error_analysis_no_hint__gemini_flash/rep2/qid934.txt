In this Year 9 mock, students frequently struggle with implicit equations where $y$ is not the subject. Many default to "pattern spotting" or simple one-step operations rather than substituting and solving.

**A (20)**: This is the "operation error." These students see the numbers 4, 10, and 2 and simply multiply ($4 \times 5 = 20$ or $10 \times 2 = 20$). They don't understand the table context.
**B (3)**: This is a sophisticated error. Students assume the $x$ values go up by 1, and mistakenly apply the gradient (from $2y = -4x + 10$) incorrectly to the first value, or guess based on the "next" value.
**C (5)**: This is the most "attractive" trap. Students correctly set $x=0$, see $2y=10$, and successfully solve for $y$. Or, they simply look at the $y$-intercept ($10 \div 2$).
**D (2.5)**: A common division error. Students take the 10 and divide it by the 4, or mix up the coefficients of $x$ and $y$.
