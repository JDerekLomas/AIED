To predict these percentages, I am considering the following pedagogical insights from marking Year 9 scripts:

*   **The BODMAS/BIDMAS Trap:** Students often interpret the "A" before "S" (Addition before Subtraction) as a rigid rule rather than a left-to-right convention. This makes **Problem P: 5+6** a very common "learned" error.
*   **The Left-to-Right Instinct:** "Below basic" students often ignore order of operations entirely, simply reading the numbers like a sentence. This makes **Option A** very attractive to them.
*   **The Middle-Ground (The "Partial Knowledge" Gap):** Many students remember that multiplication comes before addition, but still fall for the addition-before-subtraction trap in Problem P. This points them heavily towards **Option D**.
*   **Proficient vs. Advanced:** "Proficient" students generally understand multiplication comes first, but roughly half will still mistakenly group $5+6$ first due to the way BIDMAS is taught. "Advanced" students recognise that addition and subtraction have equal priority and are solved left-to-right.

below_basic: A=65% B=15% C=15% D=5%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
advanced: A=2% B=88% C=0% D=10%
