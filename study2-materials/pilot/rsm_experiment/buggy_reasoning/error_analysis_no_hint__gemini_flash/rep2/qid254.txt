Having marked thousands of these over the years, I can tell you exactly why these traps work.

**A) (The Correct Trap)**
This is the most "attractive" option. Students often subconsciously disregard 0 as "nothing." They understand they need to divide by 5 because there are five numbers, but they feel like writing "0+" is redundant or messy. This catches students across all levels who are moving too quickly.

**B) (The BIDMAS Trap)**
This reflects how students type calculations into a non-scientific calculator or a basic phone. They "read" the operation from left to right. Without brackets, BIDMAS dictates only the 7 is divided by 5. Only "proficient" students usually spot the lack of a fraction bar or brackets.

**C) (The Definition Trap)**
This catches students who rely on the rule "divide by how many numbers there are," but because 0 is "not a value," they count only 4 pieces of data.

**D) (The Logical Conclusion)**
Surprisingly few students choose D because A looks "close enough" to be right. Only advanced students will realize that the omission of the 0 in the numerator of a sum—while mathematically equivalent in result—is technically a different calculation than the literal definition of the mean for that set, but more importantly, they are the only ones who might spot that B is wrong and A is technically a valid calculation for the mean of those numbers. However, many "Advanced" students will actually pick A because they see through the zero and recognize it as the only viable method shown.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=45% C=20% D=5%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=85% B=5% C=2% D=8%
