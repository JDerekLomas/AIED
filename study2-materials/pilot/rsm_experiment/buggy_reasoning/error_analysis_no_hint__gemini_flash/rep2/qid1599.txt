To predict these percentages, I have considered the following common Year 9 misconceptions:

*   **Option B:** Appealing to the "Below Basic" student who over-complicates the numerator by trying to combine the 4 with the $c$, often confusing addition and division properties.
*   **Option C:** A classic BIDMAS error where students forget the brackets and think the division only applies to the term immediately following it, or they misunderstand how fraction bars act as a grouping symbol.
*   **Option D:** A very common "reverse order" error. Students often assume the "bigger" or more complex expression goes on top, or they simply get the dividend/divisor relationship backwards.
*   **Proficient/Advanced:** These students recognise the vinculum (fraction bar) replaces the $\div$ symbol and acts as a grouping symbol for the $h+4$.

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=8% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
