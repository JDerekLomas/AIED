In this Year 9 mock, many students struggle with the order of operations when rearranging equations. 

**Tom's method** (Adding 5 to both sides first) is the standard approach taught in UK classrooms. 
**Katie's method** (Multiplying by 3) is a common "trap." For Katie to be correct, she must multiply *every* term by 3, resulting in $x - 15 = 36$. Most students at lower and middle tiers forget to multiply the $-5$, making her line look "half-right" and very attractive to those who work purely by visual association rather than formal inverse operations.

Below-basic students often see any algebraic manipulation that removes a denominator as "correct," while proficient students often fall for Katie's line because they recognise the $12 \times 3 = 36$ but fail to distribute across the whole left-hand side.
