In this Year 9 mock, the signs are the primary "distractor." Most students remember the FOIL method or grid method for the terms, but the interaction of negatives causes significant issues, particularly in the lower ability bands.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **B (Correct):** Students correctly apply $(-5) + (-7) = -12$ and $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$.
*   **A:** The "difference" error. Students see $-5$ and $-7$ and find the difference ($2$) rather than the sum, then apply a negative. They also frequently get the sign of the constant term wrong (one negative times another negative is the most common sign error).
*   **D:** The "addition but negative constant" error. These students get the $-12m$ correct but forget that "minus times a minus makes a plus," simply carrying the negative sign from the brackets through to the multiplication.
*   **C:** The "loss of negatives" error. These students recognize the numbers are 12 and 35 but assume that since the answer "looks" cleaner with plus signs, the negatives somehow cancel out or were irrelevant.

**Predicted Distributions:**

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
