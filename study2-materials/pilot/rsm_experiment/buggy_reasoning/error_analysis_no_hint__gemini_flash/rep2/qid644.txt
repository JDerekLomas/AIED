In this Year 9 mock, this question specifically tests two things: integer arithmetic (signs) and the operation used (multiplication vs addition). Even though it's set within an algebra context, it is a test of "negative times negative".

*   **Error A (+4):** The correct application of rules. $-1 \times -4 = 4$.
*   **Error B (-4):** Neglecting the double negative. Students often correctly identify the digits but default to "if there's a minus sign, the answer stays minus."
*   **Error C (+5):** Misinterpreting the "terms" and adding the digits while being cautious about signs $(-1 -4 \rightarrow 5$ via confusion).
*   **Error D (-5):** The most common Year 9 mistake; "collecting" the terms as if simplifying ($ -1 - 4 = -5 $) rather than multiplying as indicated by the bracket expansion rule.

**The "Attractive" Trap:** Students in the "basic" and "below basic" brackets often default to addition whenever they see two numbers without a letter between them, making D a massive distractor.

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=10% D=50%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
