To predict these percentages, I have evaluated the likely misconceptions for each distractor:

*   **Option A (0.81):** This occurs when a student squares the result of $(3 \times 0.3)$. They do $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then $0.9^2 = 0.81$. This is a classic BIDMAS (order of operations) error.
*   **Option B (0.27):** This is the **correct** answer ($0.3^2 = 0.09$; $0.09 \times 3 = 0.27$).
*   **Option C (1.8):** This occurs when a student thinks $x^2$ means $x \times 2$. They calculate $3 \times 0.3 \times 2 = 1.8$.
*   **Option D (2.7):** This is a place value error. Students do $3^2 \times 3$ or they correctly square $0.3$ as $0.09$ but then lose a decimal place when multiplying by 3, or more commonly, they think $0.3^2$ is $0.9$ instead of $0.09$, leading to $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$. This is the most "attractive" trap for middle-ability students.

Below is the predicted performance distribution for a typical Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=15% B=55% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=0% D=5%
