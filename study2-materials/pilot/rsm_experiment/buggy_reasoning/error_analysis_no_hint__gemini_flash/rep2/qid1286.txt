To predict the performance for this Year 9 mock question, we must consider the rearranging process for $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

*   **Error leading to A:** Students often struggle with fraction division; they multiply by the numerator ($4\pi$) and divide by the denominator ($3$), failing to understand that to isolate $r$, you must multiply by the reciprocal.
*   **Error leading to B:** A partial understanding where the student knows $3$ moves to the top, but fails to keep $\pi$ with the $4$ in the denominator during the division step.
*   **Error leading to D:** A common algebraic "clutter" error where the student finds the cube root of $V$ first but forgets that the coefficients $4$ and $\pi$ are also part of the root operation, or they fail to apply the inverse operation of multiplication correctly across the whole term.
*   **The Trap:** Option A is highly attractive to lower-attaining students because "$\frac{4}{3} \times \pi$" looks like a single block, and their intuition is to just "multiply the $V$ by the whole formula."

Here are the predicted percentages based on typical UK Year 9 mock distributions:

below_basic: A=45% B=25% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=30% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=92% D=3%
