In this common algebraic pitfall, many students incorrectly perceive the relationship between the numbers rather than following the operations. 

The "Basic" level students often see $10$ and $5$ and intuitively feel the answer must be $2$, forgetting that the variable is in the denominator. The error $p = 50$ (Option B) comes from a misapplied multiplication "undoing" the fraction without considering where $p$ is. Option A is the correct answer ($10p = 5 \implies p = 5/10$), but it is "unattractive" because students are conditioned to want to divide the larger number by the smaller number.

**below_basic:** A=10% B=35% C=50% D=5%
**basic:** A=30% B=20% C=45% D=5%
**proficient:** A=75% B=5% C=19% D=1%
**advanced:** A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
