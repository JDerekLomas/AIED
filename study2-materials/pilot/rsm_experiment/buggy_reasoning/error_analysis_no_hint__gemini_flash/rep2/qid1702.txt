To predict these results, I’ve analysed the common misconceptions associated with this specific linear equation. 

**Distractor Analysis:**
*   **A (3.3):** The most common error. Students correctly substitute $y=0.5$ to get $10x - 3 = 30$, but then subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it, leading to $10x = 27$ and $x = 2.7$. This "inverse operation error" is the primary trap for mid-ability students.
*   **C (3.3):** Students mistake the equation for $10x + 6y = 30$. They calculate $10x + 3 = 30$, leading to $10x = 33$, hence $x = 3.3$. 
*   **B (-4.25):** Students often swap $x$ and $y$ variables, or perform a sequence of incorrect operations like $(30 \div 6) - 0.5$ then adjusting for the 10. Negative signs are often added when they feel the answer should be "more complex."
*   **A (3.3):** The correct answer. $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$.
