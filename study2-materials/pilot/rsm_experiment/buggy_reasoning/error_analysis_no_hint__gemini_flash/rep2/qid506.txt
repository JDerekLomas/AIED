Having marked several hundred of these papers, this particular question is a classic "fraction trap." Students often struggle when an operation on a fraction results in an even smaller fraction.

**Breakdown of Errors:**
*   **A ($1/4$):** The most common mistake. Students see '3' and '12' and instinctively perform $12 \div 3$, ignoring the fact that the 12 is in the denominator.
*   **B (Correct):** Students understand that they must divide by 3 (or multiply by $1/3$), resulting in $1/(12 \times 3)$.
*   **C (4):** These students are completely ignoring the fractional structure; they solve it as if it were $3p = 12$ or simply perform $12 \div 3$ and move the result to the numerator.
*   **D ($1/9$):** A rarer computation error, often stemming from misreading the 12 as a 3 or 27, or an attempt to "square root" parts of the equation through visual confusion.

Here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=50% B=10% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
