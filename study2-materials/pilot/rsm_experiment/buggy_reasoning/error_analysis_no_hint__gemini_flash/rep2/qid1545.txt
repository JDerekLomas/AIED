Having marked 200 of these scripts, this question specifically tests BIDMAS/order of operations. The most common error is the "left-to-right" fallacy—performing addition before division.

*   **Left-hand side calculation:** The correct answer is $8 + 3 = 11$. The common error is $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$.
*   **Right-hand side calculation:** The calculation is clearly $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$.
*   **The Trap:** Students who calculate the LHS as 5 will choose 'C' (Equal). Students who correctly get 11 vs 5 will choose 'A'. Students who confuse the inequality signs or rush the subtraction may choose 'B'. 'D' is usually a "panic guess" for those who don't understand inequality notation.

Here is the predicted distribution based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=3% D=0%
