Based on my experience marking these scripts, here is the breakdown of how Year 9 students typically approach this question.

**The "Attractor" Logic:**
*   **A is the correct answer.** Most students find adding mixed numbers with the same denominator intuitive ($2+1=3$ and $1/5+2/5=3/5$).
*   **B is a "Method Trap."** This is the correct numerical value but as an improper fraction. Many proficient students reflexively convert to improper fractions to add ($11/5 + 7/5 = 18/5$) but forget to convert back despite the question's instruction.
*   **C is the "Add Everything" error.** This is the classic "Lower-Basic" mistake where students add the numerators AND the denominators ($1+2=3$ and $5+5=10$), while ignoring the whole numbers or mismanaging them entirely.
*   **D is the "Common Denominator" confusion.** These students correctly add the whole numbers but follow the "Add Everything" logic for the fraction part, resulting in $3/10$.

**Predicted Responses:**

below_basic: A=25% B=10% C=35% D=30%
basic: A=65% B=15% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=12% C=1% D=2%
advanced: A=97% B=3% C=0% D=0%
