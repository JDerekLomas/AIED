In this Year 9 cohort, the most common trap is ignoring BIDMAS/order of operations by simply working from left to right. This makes Option B the most frequent incorrect answer for lower-ability students. Option D is an "attractive" error for those who correctly identify the multiplication first ($8$) but then struggle with directed numbers ($3 - (5+8)$), while Option C represents the "total chaos" error (performing all additions/subtractions before any multiplication: $(3-5+4) \times 2$).

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=45% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
