To simplify $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator. The most direct method is to multiply the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$, resulting in $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$ (Option A).

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** The classic "add across" error. $3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$. This is highly attractive to lower-ability students who treat algebraic fractions like integers.
*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** The student recognizes they need $2x$ as a denominator but fails to adjust the numerator of the second fraction (doing $3+4$ over $2x$).
*   **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** The student correctly identifies the $8$, but "cancels" or loses the $2$ in the denominator during the final step.

**Predicted Performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** Mostly choose B, applying the simplest (wrong) rule of adding everything they see.
*   **Basic:** Heavily split between B and D. They know the denominator should stay somewhat consistent, but often forget to multiply the numerator when scaling a fraction.
*   **Proficient:** Most will identify the correct process for A, though a significant minority will still fall for D under exam pressure.
*   **Advanced:** Almost all will reach A, with the tiny remainder making a silly arithmetic slip or a "clever" over-simplification leading to C.
