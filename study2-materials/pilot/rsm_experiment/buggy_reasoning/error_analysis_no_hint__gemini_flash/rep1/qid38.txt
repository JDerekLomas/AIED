To simplify $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator, which is $2x$. This requires multiplying the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$, resulting in $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$ (Option A).

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option B ($\frac{7}{3x}$):** The classic "add the tops, add the bottoms" error ($3+4$ and $2x+x$). This is the most common misconception for students who struggle with the concept of denominators.
*   **Option D ($\frac{7}{2x}$):** Students recognise the denominator needs to be $2x$, but they forget to scale the numerator of the second fraction, simply adding $3+4$ over the new denominator.
*   **Option C ($\frac{11}{x}$):** A less common mechanical error where a student finds the correct numerator ($11$) but somehow simplifies the $2x$ incorrectly or assumes the $x$ is the dominant denominator.
