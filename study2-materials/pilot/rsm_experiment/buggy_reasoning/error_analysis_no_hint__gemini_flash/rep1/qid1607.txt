To predict the performance of a Year 9 cohort, we must look at the specific trap in Step 2. 

**Step 1** is a correct multiplication by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). 
**Step 2** is the "classic" sign error. To isolate $k$ from $60 = 1 + k$, the student should subtract 1 to get $59$. Instead, Isaac adds 1 to get $61$. 

*   **Below Basic** students often struggle with multi-step operations and may view "moving" the 1 to the other side as needing a change in sign, but frequently default to addition if they are guessing or following a loose pattern of "the numbers go up."
*   **Basic** students are the "target audience" for this trap. They recognise that 60 is $15 \times 4$, so they think Step 1 is fine. However, they lack the fluency in inverse operations to spot that $+1$ should become $-1$. They see "60, 1, and 61" as a family of numbers that "fits" together.
*   **Proficient** students are usually the ones who choose Option A. They correctly verify the multiplication but are eagle-eyed enough to notice that $1+59=60$, not $1+61=60$. 
*   **Advanced** students will solve the equation mentally in seconds and see that while Step 1 matches their working, Step 2 is an obvious error.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=2% C=15% D=3%
advanced: A=96% B=0% C=3% D=1%
