To predict these percentages, I have considered the following common Year 9 misconceptions:

*   **The Sign Trap:** Students often correctly identify that the reciprocal ($\frac{4}{3}$) is involved but struggle with the signs. Because the answer is negative, many intuitively think they need a positive number ($+$ times $-$ equals $-$). This makes **A** the most dangerous "distractor."
*   **The Additive vs Multiplicative Confusion:** Students at the "Below Basic" level often confuse "getting to $-1$" with addition or subtraction, leading them to pick **C** or **D** (thinking $\frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{4}$, etc., or simply mimicking the numbers already in the question).
*   **The Reciprocal Knowledge:** "Basic" students know they need to "flip" the fraction but are the most likely to fall for the sign trap. "Proficient" students usually remember that a negative times a positive is a negative, leading them to correctly select **A**. "Advanced" students check their work ($-\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = -\frac{12}{12} = -1$) and rarely miss this.

Note: In this specific equation, the answer is **A**. **B** would result in $+1$.

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=3% C=1% D=0%
