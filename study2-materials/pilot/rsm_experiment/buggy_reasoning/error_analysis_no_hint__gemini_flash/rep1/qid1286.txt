To predict the performance of Year 9 students on this question, we must consider the typical algebraic manipulation errors made when rearranging the sphere volume formula: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

*   **Option C (Correct):** Requires multiplying by 3, dividing by $4\pi$, and then taking the cube root.
*   **Option B (Common Trap):** Students often associate the "3" with the denominator in the final answer because it was in the denominator of the original fraction ($\frac{4}{3}$), failing to realise that "multiplying across" moves it to the numerator.
*   **Option A (Multiplication Error):** Students who know the numbers 3, 4, and $\pi$ are involved but treat the $\frac{4}{3}$ as a single unit to be multiplied, or simply guess based on which symbols "look" like they belong together.
*   **Option D (The 'BIDMAS' or Rooting Error):** A classic mistake where students apply the cube root only to the $V$ rather than the entire expression, or mistakenly try to move the fraction coefficients outside the radical.

Here is the predicted distribution based on marking a typical UK Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=35% B=30% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=25% C=55% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=8% C=88% D=2%
