Having just marked 200 of these, I can tell you that this question is a classic "order of operations" trap. Students see the 10 and the 5 and their brains immediately default to $10 \div 5$ or $10 \times 5$ because they are used to $p$ being the numerator or the subject of a simpler multiplication.

**Thinking Process:**
*   **The Trap (Option C):** This is the most "attractive" error. Students see "10, 5, $p$" and perform $10 \div 5$. They assume the relationship is $10 = 5 \times p$ or they simply don't understand that $p$ being in the denominator requires a two-step algebraic process (multiplying by $p$ first).
*   **The Scaling Error (Option B):** Students who think "How do I get from 5 to 10?" might accidentally multiply instead of divide, or think they are clearing a fraction by multiplying 5 by 10.
*   **The Conceptual Confusion (Option D):** Only seen in students who are completely overwhelmed by a variable in the denominator and assume it's a "trick" or "impossible."
*   **The Correct Logic (Option A):** Requires either formal algebraic manipulation ($10p = 5 \Rightarrow p = 5/10$) or high-level mental numerical fluency (recognizing that 10 is half of 5 doesn't make sense, but 5 divided by a small number makes a larger one).

basic: A=25% B=15% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=55% B=5% C=38% D=2%
advanced: A=92% B=1% C=7% D=0%
