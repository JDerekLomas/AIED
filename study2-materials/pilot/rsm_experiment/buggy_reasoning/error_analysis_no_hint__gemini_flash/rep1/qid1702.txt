To predict the outcome for this Year 9 mock question, we must look at the specific algebraic traps involved in rearranging $10x - 6y = 30$ when $y = 0.5$.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **A is the correct answer:** $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$. (Wait, my manual check reveals **C is 3.3**). 
*   *Correction*: $10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$. **C is the correct answer.**
*   **Option D (2.7)**: The most common "attractive" error. Students subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it ($10x = 27$), forgetting that to undo $-3$ they must add.
*   **Option A (4.25)**: This occurs when students incorrectly handle the constant or the multiplier (e.g., adding $12.5$ instead of $3$ due to confusing $y$ coefficients). 
*   **Option B (-4.25)**: A sign error coupled with a calculation mistake, common among students guessing or struggling with negative integers.

**Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic**: Many will guess or try to perform a single operation (like $30 \div 10 + 0.5$) without a formal algebraic process.
*   **Basic**: Most will substitute correctly but fail the "inverse operation" step, subtracting 3 from 30 to get 27, leading them directly to the "D" trap.
*   **Proficient**: These students usually move the 3 correctly but might make a division error. They are the most likely to land on the correct "C".
*   **Advanced**: These students have a high degree of confidence in two-step equations and will rarely fall for the sign error trap.
