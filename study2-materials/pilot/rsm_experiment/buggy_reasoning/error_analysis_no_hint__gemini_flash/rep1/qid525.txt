To arrive at these predictions, I have considered the following common Year 9 behaviours:

*   **The Trap (Option D):** The most common error for lower-ability students is "adding across"—adding the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), then adding the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$). It feels intuitive and "easy."
*   **The Misreading (Option A):** Many students find the correct sum but fail to read the instruction to "leave your answer as a mixed number." $4 \frac{19}{20}$ is equivalent to $\frac{99}{20}$, but a student confident with improper fractions might convert to them immediately and forget to switch back.
*   **The Common Denominator Error (Option C):** This represents students who know they need a common denominator but simply multiply the two given denominators ($10 \times 4 = 40$) without adjusting the numerators correctly, or they arrive at $99/20$ but somehow think the denominator should be $40$.
*   **The Successful Method (Option B):** This requires finding the LCM (20), converting the fractional parts correctly ($\frac{14}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{19}{20}$), and combining with the whole numbers.

Here are the predicted percentages:

basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
