Here is the predicted breakdown for these Year 9 mock exam results, based on typical UK classroom misconceptions regarding BIDMAS/BODMAS.

**Teacher's Reflection:**
In **Problem P**, the "addition comes before subtraction" rule is the most persistent myth in UK schools. Students often think "A comes before S in BIDMAS," leading them to incorrectly group $(5+6)$ first.
In **Problem Q**, the trap is "working left-to-right" versus following the hierarchy of operations.

*   **A is the "Left-to-Right" Trap:** This is the most common error for weaker students who ignore order of operations entirely.
*   **B is Correct:** It correctly identifies left-to-right for equal priority (+/-) and order of operations for Q.
*   **C is the "Linguistically Literal" Trap:** Students incorrectly apply the "A before S" rule in P and ignore hierarchy in Q.
*   **D is the "Over-application of BIDMAS" Trap:** These students know $\times$ beats $+$, but they mistakenly think $+$ *must* always beat $-$.
