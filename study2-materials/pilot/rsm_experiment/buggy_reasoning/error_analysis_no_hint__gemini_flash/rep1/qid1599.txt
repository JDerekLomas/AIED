To predict these results, I have considered the following common Year 9 misconceptions:
*   **The Dividend/Divisor Swap (D):** A very common error where students assume the "bigger" or more "complex" part of the expression must go on top, or they simply confuse the order of numerator and denominator.
*   **The Fraction Line as a Partial Operator (C):** Students who understand division as a fraction but fail to recognise the brackets as a grouping mechanism, leading them to only "divide" the first term.
*   **Visual Pattern Matching (B):** Low-ability students often "hallucinate" extra terms to make the fraction look "balanced" or simply guess based on the numbers visible.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=55% B=5% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=5% D=8%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
