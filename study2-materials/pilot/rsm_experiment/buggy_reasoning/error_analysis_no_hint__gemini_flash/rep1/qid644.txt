In this Year 9 mock, students frequently trip up on the distinction between adding and multiplying when working with negative numbers. This particular question isolates the specific step of the "FOIL" or "Grid" method that causes the most sign errors.

**Calculation Errors and Student Logic:**
*   **Option A (+4):** The correct answer. Requires knowing that a negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive.
*   **Option B (-4):** The "Magnitude over Sign" error. Students know $1 \times 4 = 4$ but assume that because there are negative signs in the brackets, the result must be negative. 
*   **Option C (+5):** The "Operation Switch" error. Students see the digits and perform $-1 - 4 = -5$, but then forget the sign or think they need to flip it. 
*   **Option D (-5):** The "Addition Trap". This is the most attractive distractor for lower-ability students. They see $-1$ and $-4$ and instinctively sum them rather than multiplying, often due to a poor understanding of what "expanding brackets" physically requires for each step.

**Student Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often confuse multiplication with addition/subtraction. Many will choose -5.
*   **Basic:** Usually identify that multiplication is required ($1 \times 4$), but roughly half will still get the sign wrong (choosing -4).
*   **Proficient:** Understand the operation but can be rushed. A small number will still fall for the -4 trap if they aren't checking signs systematically.
*   **Advanced:** Will see this as a "gift" mark. Very high accuracy, only failing through a rare "slip of the pen."
