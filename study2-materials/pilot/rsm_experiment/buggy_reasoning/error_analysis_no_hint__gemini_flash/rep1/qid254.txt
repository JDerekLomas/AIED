Having marked hundreds of these papers, here is the breakdown of how Year 9 students typically approach this mean calculation problem, which specifically tests their understanding of the number zero and the order of operations (BIDMAS).

**Teacher’s Notes on Common Pitfalls:**
*   **The Zero Trap:** "Below Basic" and "Basic" students often believe that 0 "doesn't count." This leads them directly to Option C, where they divide by 4. 
*   **The BIDMAS Trap:** Option B is a classic "calculator syntax" error. Students who think linearly or rely on basic scientific calculator input without brackets will choose this, as they don't realise only the 7 is being divided by 5.
*   **The "Sensible" Shortcut:** Option A is the correct mathematical process ($\frac{15}{5} = 3$), and while the 0 is omitted from the numerator sum, it doesn't change the total. Proficient students recognize this is mathematically sound.
*   **The Over-Thinker:** Advanced students sometimes choose D because they are looking for a "perfect" representation that includes $+ 0$ in the numerator, or they over-analyse the BIDMAS in option B and the "missing" zero in A.

**Predicted Performance Breakdown:**

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=50% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=25% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=10% C=15% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%
