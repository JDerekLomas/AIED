Having marked 200 of these scripts, this question highlights the common "adding the denominator" misconception and the tendency for students to stop before reading the final instruction regarding the format of the answer.

**My thought process on the distractors:**
*   **A (The Correct Answer):** This is straightforward for most, but lower-ability students often feel addition must involve changing *everything* (the "if it's easy, I'm doing it wrong" syndrome).
*   **B (The Correct Value, Wrong Format):** This is the biggest "trap" for Year 9. They have been drilled to convert to improper fractions to add. They do the hard work ($\frac{11}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{18}{5}$), feel a sense of accomplishment, and circle B without converting back to a mixed number as requested.
*   **C (The "Add Everything" Error):** The classic mistake for below-basic students. They add the numerators ($1+2=3$) and the denominators ($5+5=10$), then treat the whole numbers similarly or ignore them. $\frac{18}{10}$ often comes from $(\frac{11+7}{5+5})$.
*   **D (The Denominator Error):** Students add the whole numbers correctly (3) and numerators correctly (3), but succumb to the urge to add the denominators ($5+5=10$). This is an incredibly common "instinct" error.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=75% B=20% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=4% C=0% D=0%
