Having marked several hundred of these scripts, this question is a classic "procedural trap" for Year 9s. Even though the algebra is simple ($p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3$), the interaction with fractions causes significant cognitive load.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **Option A ($1/4$):** This is the most common error. Students see $3$ and $12$ and their brain performs $12 \div 3$ instead of dividing the fraction by 3. They treat the $1/12$ as a $12$ and then simply keep it as a fraction.
*   **Option B (Correct):** To get this, a student must correctly apply the rule for dividing a fraction by an integer ($\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3}$) or recognize that three $p$s make a twelfth, so one $p$ must be a third of that.
*   **Option C ($4$):** These students are completely disregarding the fractional structure. They see $3$ and $12$ and solve it as $3p=12$.
*   **Option D ($1/9$):** A "distractor" for those who try to subtract 3 from 12 or make a different calculation error involving $3 \times 3$, but far less common than A or C.
