In Year 9, this specific equation highlights the hierarchy of inverse operations. Tom's method (adding 5 first) is the standard classroom approach. Katie’s method (multiplying by 3 first) is a classic "trapped" error because students often forget that to multiply the LHS by 3, they must multiply *every* term, including the 5.

**The "Attractiveness" of Errors:**
- **Katie's Error (B):** This is highly attractive to "Basic" students who see the division by 3 and want to "undo" it immediately. They often fail to distribute the multiplication across the $-5$.
- **The "Both" Trap (C):** Students often think there are multiple ways to solve an equation (which is true), so they assume both methods work without actually checking the algebraic validity of Katie's specific step.
- **Tom (A):** The correct method. Proficient students have the muscle memory to "move the constant first."

**Student Performance Predictions:**
- **Below Basic:** These students often guess or choose C because "they both look like things teachers do."
- **Basic:** Likely to be split between B and C. They recognize Katie's move (multiplying) but don't realise she forgot to multiply the 5.
- **Proficient:** Most will correctly identify Tom. Some might be lured into C thinking Katie’s "first step" is valid if you just "do the same to both sides" without checking the bracket distribution.
- **Advanced:** Will immediately spot that Katie would need to write $x - 15 = 36$ for it to be correct.
