To predict these percentages, I’ve analysed the common pitfalls for a typical Year 9 cohort:

*   **The Trap (Option B):** The most common error is processing the operations left-to-right (the "reading order" bias). $3 - 5 = -2$, then $+ 4 = 2$, then $\times 2 = 4$. This feels natural to students who have a weak grasp of BIDMAS/order of operations.
*   **The "Addition First" Error (Option D):** Students who strictly follow the acronym "BODMAS" often believe Addition *must* happen before Subtraction. They calculate $5+4=9$, leading to $3 - 9 \times 2$ or more commonly $3 - (5+4)$, then $\times 2$, resulting in $(3-9) \times 2 = -12$ or similar configurations reaching $-10$.
*   **Negative Number Confusion (Option C):** A classic mistake where students multiply $4 \times 2 = 8$, but then perform $3 - (5+8)$, essentially incorrectly grouping the subtraction sign with the entire tail end of the sum.
*   **The Correct Method (Option A):** $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 - 5 + 8$. Note that many students get $3-5$ wrong here (calculating it as $2$), potentially leading back to incorrect answers even if they started the order correctly.
