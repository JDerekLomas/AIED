Having marked hundreds of these papers, the common pitfall here is the tension between BIDMAS/order of operations and the physical layout of the numbers.

**Thinking Process:**
*   **The Trap:** Students who read left-to-right without applying BIDMAS will calculate $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$ for the left side. Since the right side is explicitly $(8+12) \div 4 = 5$, they conclude they are equal (Option C).
*   **The Misconception:** Lower-ability students often assume that the brackets are "extra" or just there to clarify what they were going to do anyway.
*   **Calculation Errors:**
    *   LHS correct: $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$
    *   LHS incorrect (Left-to-Right): $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$
    *   RHS: $20 \div 4 = 5$
*   **Analysis:** If a student calculates the left side as 5, they pick C. If they calculate it as 11, they pick A. Very few students pick B or D unless they are purely guessing.

**Predicted Distributions:**

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
*(Below basic students almost always work left-to-right. C is the "obvious" choice because the numbers look identical in sequence. B and D are distractors for those who guess.)*

basic: A=35% B=10% C=50% D=5%
*(The "Basic" Year 9 student knows the word BIDMAS but often fails to apply it if a calculation looks "simple" enough to do instinctively left-to-right. Option C remains a very "sticky" distractor here.)*

proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
*(Proficient students usually apply BIDMAS reliably. Those who get it wrong are usually rushing and falling for the visual similarity of the two sides, assuming the brackets don't change the value.)*

advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
*(Advanced students will spot the "trick" immediately. The tiny percentage of errors comes from simple processing slips or misreading the inequality symbol.)*
