In my experience marking this specific topic with Year 9 students, the difficulty arises not from the substitution itself, but from the rules of negative integers and indices.

**A (81) is the correct answer.** Even powers of negative numbers result in positive products.
**B (12) and D (-12)** represent the "multiplication trap," where students multiply the base by the exponent ($3 \times 4$) rather than performing repeated multiplication. This is incredibly common at the lower end.
**C (-81)** is the "most attractive" distractor for mid-to-high ability students. Many students believe that because the input is negative, the output must be negative, or they are misled by how their non-VPAM scientific calculators handle $-3^4$ without brackets.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on a typical Year 9 cohort:

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
