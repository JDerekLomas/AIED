To predict these percentages, I have evaluated the most common Year 9 misconceptions regarding expanding double brackets and directed numbers (negative integers).

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **A (The "Subtraction Error"):** Students get -12m but somehow arrive at -2m (perhaps -7 + 5 or just finding the difference between 7 and 5).
*   **B (Correct):** The student correctly identifies $(-5) + (-7) = -12$ and $(-5) \times (-7) = +35$.
*   **C (The "Sign Swap"):** The student knows the middle term is 12 and the end is 35, but fails to handle the negatives, assuming "negative and a negative makes a positive" applies to both the addition and multiplication.
*   **D (The "Multiply Error"):** The most common mistake. Students successfully add $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12m$, but then do $(-5) \times (-7) = -35$, forgetting that a negative times a negative equals a positive.

**Predicted Results:**

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=35% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=70% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
