To solve the given problem, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions and then add them. The correct steps involve finding a common denominator, which in this case would be \(2x\), and then converting each fraction to have that denominator before adding them. Let's analyze the incorrect options and the reasoning behind them:

1. **Option B: \(\frac{7}{3x}\)**  
   - **Misconception:** When adding fractions, add the numerators and denominators.  
   - **Attractiveness:** Moderately attractive, as it seems like a straightforward rule that might not be immediately recognized as incorrect, especially for students who have not fully grasped the concept of a common denominator.  
   - **Likely ability levels:** Below basic and possibly basic students who are still developing their understanding of fraction addition.

2. **Option C: \(\frac{11}{x}\)**  
   - **Misconception:** Assuming that when adding fractions with different denominators, the denominator will simply be the same as one of the fractions, or incorrectly simplifying without considering the common denominator.  
   - **Attractiveness:** Less attractive than Option B, as this error may involve a step or assumption that feels less intuitive to students who have any grasp of the concept. However, it could still occur if a student is over-relying on pattern recognition rather than understanding the underlying principles.  
   - **Likely ability levels:** Below basic, with a possibility of some basic students making this mistake if rushed or not attentive to their work.

3. **Option D: \(\frac{7}{2x}\)**  
   - **Misconception:** Failing to properly account for the numerators after finding a common denominator (in this case, \(2x\)). This might involve adding \(3 + 4 = 7\) correctly but then not recognizing the need to adjust based on the specific fractions given.  
   - **Attractiveness:** Somewhat attractive for students who understand the concept of finding a common denominator but might not fully grasp how to correctly combine the fractions. This could include basic and possibly some proficient students who are doing calculations quickly and might lose track of the denominators' impact on the final sum.  
   - **Likely ability levels:** Basic to possibly some proficient students who are working under time pressure or not double-checking their work.

Given this analysis, here's a predicted response distribution:

- **Below Basic:**
  - A (Correct) = 10%
  - B = 40% (Misconception of adding numerators and denominators)
  - C = 30% (Assuming the wrong common denominator or simplification)
  - D = 20% (Miscalculation after finding common denominator)

- **Basic:**
  - A (Correct) = 30%
  - B = 20% (Same misconception, but some students start to grasp correct methods)
  - C = 15% (Start to understand the need for common denominators, reducing this error)
  - D = 35% (Increased calculation errors or misunderstandings with finding common denominators)

- **Proficient:**
  - A (Correct) = 70%
  - B = 5% (Most have learned to avoid the simplest misconceptions)
  - C = 5% (Better understanding of fraction arithmetic)
  - D = 20% (Might still rush and make calculation errors)

- **Advanced:**
  - A (Correct) = 90%
  - B = 1% (Extremely rare for advanced students to make such a basic error)
  - C = 1% (Similar to B, a rare misunderstanding)
  - D = 8% (Could still occur from carelessness or miscalculation under time pressure, but less likely)

These distributions are speculative and based on the assumption that the student body has a wide range of abilities and understanding levels regarding fraction arithmetic. Actual performances could vary significantly depending on specific instructional methods, student engagements, and prior knowledge.
