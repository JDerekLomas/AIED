To diagnose the student errors for each wrong answer option and assess the attractiveness of these errors, let's examine each:

1. **Option A: \( \frac{99}{20} \)**  
   - **Buggy Reasoning:** A student might incorrectly add the fractions after converting the mixed numbers to improper fractions without finding a common denominator, or they might misunderstand the conversion process of mixed numbers to improper fractions and back.  
   - **Attractiveness:** This error could be somewhat attractive, especially to students who are just beginning to learn about adding mixed numbers and fractions (below_basic to basic levels). The process involves several steps (converting to improper fractions, finding a common denominator, adding, and converting back to a mixed number), and any confusion in these steps could lead to an incorrect answer.  

2. **Option C: \( \frac{99}{40} \)**  
   - **Buggy Reasoning:** The known misconception is "When adding fractions, adds the numerators and denominators." For example, \( 2 \frac{7}{10} + 2 \frac{1}{4} \) would be calculated as \( 2 + 2 + \frac{7+1}{10+4} = 4 \frac{8}{14} \), but in this case, specifically for option C, it seems there's an additional mistake in simplification or converting the mixed numbers to fractions and back. However, strictly following the given misconception would not directly lead to \( \frac{99}{40} \). It seems there's an additional layer of error or simplification that doesn't directly align with the provided misconception. Given the direct application of the misconception would not yield \( \frac{99}{40} \), let's reassess: A more likely path to \( \frac{99}{40} \) directly doesn't follow from the described misconception in a straightforward manner. A direct addition of numerators and denominators without proper conversion doesn't neatly result in \( \frac{99}{40} \) based on the initial description.  
   - **Attractiveness:** Moderate. Given the complexity and the fact that the simple addition of numerators and denominators (\( 7+1 \) over \( 10+4 \)) doesn't directly yield \( \frac{99}{40} \), this might be less attractive as it involves an additional layer of incorrect calculation or misunderstanding. Students at all levels could be prone to various calculation errors, but the specific attractiveness might be lower due to the indirect path to this answer.

3. **Option D: \( 4 \frac{8}{14} \)**  
   - **Buggy Reasoning:** Adding the whole numbers correctly (2+2=4) but then incorrectly adding the fractions by directly adding numerators and denominators without finding a common denominator or properly converting back to a mixed number.  
   - **Attractiveness:** Highly attractive, particularly to below_basic and basic levels. This error feels like a "reasonable" next step to students who are just learning about adding mixed numbers and might not fully understand the need for a common denominator when adding fractions.

Given these analyses, predicting the response distribution can be subjective, but based on the attractiveness and the commonality of the errors, here's a possible distribution:

- **Below_Basic (students struggling with basic concepts):**  
  A=10% B=20% C=15% D=55%  
  - Errors in basic fraction and mixed number operations are common, and the direct addition of numerators and denominators (option D) would be a prevalent mistake.

- **Basic (students with a foundational understanding):**  
  A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%  
  - As students progress, their grasp of proper fraction addition improves, but confusion about mixed numbers and common denominators can persist, making option B more plausible as a correct approach is better understood.

- **Proficient (students confident in fraction operations):**  
  A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%  
  - At this level, students are less likely to fall into basic traps but might still make calculation errors or misunderstand certain conversion steps, though much less frequently.

- **Advanced (students proficient and applying knowledge in complex scenarios):**  
  A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%  
  - Advanced students are expected to manage mixed number and fraction operations with ease, making errors in basic calculation (e.g., options A, C, and D) very infrequent.

Keep in mind that these distributions are hypothetical and based on the attractiveness of the errors and their alignment with typical student misconceptions at different learning levels. Actual distributions can vary widely depending on the specific educational context, the prior knowledge of the students, and how concepts have been taught and reinforced.
