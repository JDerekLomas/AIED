To address the question, let's break down each wrong answer option, identify the likely misconception, and then assess the attractiveness of each error.

1. **Option B: \( p = 50 \)**
   - Misconception: "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse."
   - Attractiveness: This error can be quite attractive, especially for students who are not fully confident in their understanding of inverse operations. Instead of multiplying both sides by \(p\) or correctly inverting the fraction, a student might simply multiply both sides by 5, thinking they're "getting rid" of the 5 in the numerator, leading to \(10p = 5\), and then incorrectly dividing both sides by 10 to get \(p = 50\). This mistake feels like a reasonable step to someone not fully grasping inverse operations, making it moderately attractive, particularly at the basic level.
   - Likelyability levels: Most likely at basic level, less so at proficient and advanced levels.

2. **Option C: \( p = 2 \)**
   - Misconception: Incorrectly handling the fraction or a confusion with similar problems.
   - Buggy reasoning could involve trying to directly compare numerators, incorrectly simplifying the fraction, or mixing up properties of equations.
   - Attractiveness: This option feels somewhat reasonable because it's a simple, small number that "looks" right, especially if a student misunderstands the relationship between the variables and constants in the equation. However, it requires a more nuanced mix of misunderstandings (perhaps confusing multiplication and division roles in equation solving or incorrectly simplifying fractions) to actually calculate this way. Thus, while it might be tempting for a student struggling with fractions or algebra, it's less directly "attractive" as a logical next step compared to Option B. 
   - Likelyability levels: This could happen at below_basic and basic levels but is less predictable compared to the mistake in Option B.

3. **Option D: "There are no solutions"**
   - Misconception: Incorrectly assessing the nature of the equation or a failure to check the steps of solving it.
   - Buggy reasoning might involve overgeneralizing from previous equations with no solutions, incorrectly concluding that this type of equation cannot have a valid solution, or simply giving up without properly attempting to solve the equation.
   - Attractiveness: This error might not feel particularly "attractive" as it involves either an overgeneralization or a failure to engage with solving the equation. However, students who feel overwhelmed or who are not confident in their mathematical abilities might prematurely conclude there's no solution due to a perceived complexity of the equation or past experiences with unsolvable equations. It's somewhat less attractive as it reflects a more general "giving up" rather than a specific misconception about mathematical operations.
   - Likelyability levels: Could be prevalent at any level but more likely at below_basic, where confidence and competence in solving equations are lower.

Given these analyses, here's a predicted response distribution:

- **below_basic:** A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%  
    (Here, students might struggle significantly, leading to a wide distribution of errors, including giving up.)

- **basic:** A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%  
    (More students start to solve correctly, but the Option B error, using the same operation rather than its inverse, remains prevalent.)

- **proficient:** A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%  
    (Most students solve correctly, with fewer instances of errors as their understanding of inverse operations and algebra becomes more solid.)

- **advanced:** A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%  
    (At this level, most errors have been ironed out due to a deep understanding of mathematical principles, and very few students would select incorrect options.)

Please note, these distributions are rough and based on an intuitive analysis of common mistakes in algebra and equation solving. The actual distribution might vary depending on specific classroom experiences, teaching methodologies, and the prior knowledge and understanding of the students.
