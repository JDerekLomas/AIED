To address the question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identifying the correct next line of working:**

   - To solve the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\), we should first isolate the term involving \(x\).
   - Adding 5 to both sides gives \(\frac{x}{3} = 12 + 5\), which simplifies to \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\).

   So, Tom is correct in stating that a correct next line of working could be \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\).

   - Katie's suggestion, \(x - 5 = 36\), does not follow from the original equation by any standard algebraic manipulation directly related to solving for \(x\). It seems she might have tried to eliminate the fraction, but in doing so, did not perform a valid operation to obtain a next step. This line of working seems incorrect as it doesn't logically follow from adding 5 to both sides of the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12\) which would correctly be \(\frac{x}{3} = 17\), and then you would multiply both sides by 3 to isolate \(x\), getting \(x = 51\), not \(x - 5 = 36\).

2. **Analyzing the misconceptions and attractions for wrong options:**

   - **Option B (Only Katie):** This would be chosen by students who misunderstand the steps of solving linear equations, possibly trying to avoid dealing with fractions by incorrectly eliminating them. This reasoning might seem attractive to students at a basic level who are not yet confident with manipulating fractions in equations. **Attraction level: 6/10** (It doesn't feel very reasonable to experienced solvers but might appear as a shortcut to those less accustomed to algebraic manipulations.)

   - **Option C (Both Tom and Katie):** Students who choose this option are likely not paying close attention to the validity of each step or might be overconfident, accepting any line of reasoning without scrutiny. This error might be due to a lack of checking one's work against the original problem statement or the equation's requirements. **Attraction level: 4/10** (Not very attractive since it requires ignoring the discrepancy in Katie's step.)

   - **Option D (Neither is correct):** This is guided by the known misconception "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse." A student who applies this faulty reasoning might try to directly solve the equation without appropriately using inverse operations, thus possibly never arriving at a correct manipulation like Tom's or any other valid method. **Attraction level: 7/10** (This error is fairly natural for those not solidly grasping inverse operations, making it somewhat attractive, particularly at lower ability levels.)

3. **Inferring the attractiveness for Option A (Only Tom) is less relevant because we're focused on the errors, but it's the correct answer.**

4. **Predicting the response distribution:**

Based on the above analysis and understanding that these distributions are hypothetical and dependent on a range of factors including curriculum, teaching methods, and student exposure to similar problems, I'll make an educated prediction:

- **Below Basic:** A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40% (Students at this level may not have well-established methods for solving linear equations and might be prone to errors such as Option D, with some guessing and less adherence to the correct method.)
  
- **Basic:** A=50% B=15% C=10% D=25% (Students here are developing their algebra skills but might still struggle with applying inverse operations correctly or might confuse operations, leading some to choose incorrect options.)

- **Proficient:** A=70% B=5% C=5% D=20% (Proficient students are more likely to apply algebra rules correctly and recognize the mistake in Katie's method. They are less likely to fall for Operation D's misconception due to a better grasp of algebraic principles.)

- **Advanced:** A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10% (Advanced students will likely identify the correctness of Tom's step with confidence and will have a strong foundation in algebraic manipulations, leaving little room for the type of error seen in Option D.)

Note: These response distributions are speculative and based on the given context and analysis of the types of errors that might occur. Actual results could vary widely based on specific educational contexts and student preparation.
