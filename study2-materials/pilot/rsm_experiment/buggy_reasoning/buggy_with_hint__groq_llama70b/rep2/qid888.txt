To solve the given problem, we need to multiply out the brackets:
\[
(m-5)(m-7)
\]
Using the distributive property (FOIL method) for multiplication:
\[
(m-5)(m-7) = m \cdot m + m \cdot (-7) + (-5) \cdot m + (-5) \cdot (-7)
\]
\[
= m^2 - 7m - 5m + 35
\]
\[
= m^2 - 12m + 35
\]

### 1. Identifying the Specific Buggy Reasoning for Each Wrong Answer Option

- **Option A (\( m^{2}-2 m-35 \))**: This error could result from incorrectly applying the distributive property, perhaps by only considering the multiplication of the first terms and the last terms and then incorrectly handling the middle terms, or a mistake in combining like terms, such as forgetting to multiply the negatives together properly or miscounting the coefficient of the middle term. It seems like a computational or attention-to-detail error rather than a misconception about the underlying mathematical concept.

- **Option C (\( m^{2}+12 m+35 \))**: This answer could arise from mistakenly adding instead of subtracting when dealing with the negative terms inside the brackets, indicating a misunderstanding of how to handle signs when multiplying or distributing. It's a fundamental error in sign handling, suggesting a need to review basic rules of multiplication with negatives.

- **Option D (\( m^{2}-12 m-35 \))**: As given, this option results from the misconception that multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer. Normally, when expanding \((m-5)(m-7)\), students would correctly calculate \((-5) \cdot (-7)\) to be \(+35\), but those holding this misconception would get \(-35\) instead.

### 2. Judging the Attractiveness of Each Error

- **Option A**: This error might seem less "attractive" because it likely results from a calculation error rather than a conceptual misunderstanding. It could happen to anyone having a momentary lapse in careful calculation or attention to detail, but it's not as inherently tempting as others because it doesn't leverage common misconceptions about negative numbers.

- **Option C**: Errors like this might be moderately attractive, particularly to students who are still shaky on handling negative numbers. However, it's not as subtle a mistake as some others since it typically reflects a direct misunderstanding of basic rules rather than a conceptual or strategy-level error.

- **Option D**: This is quite attractive to students who have the mentioned misconception about multiplying negatives. For those students, the mistake feels mathematically consistent with their (erroneous) understanding. Given the prevalence of struggles with negative numbers, this might be relatively common, especially among those still solidifying their grasp of algebraic manipulations.

### 3. Predicting Response Distribution

Given the nature of these errors, here's a hypothetical response distribution. Note that this prediction assumes familiarity with the common difficulties and errors seen in students across various levels of mathematical proficiency:

**below_basic**: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%  
- At this level, students may frequently struggle with basics, such as sign rules and multiplication of variables. Option D might be particularly prevalent due to its reliance on a common misconception about negative multiplication, which might have been reinforced by insufficient or mistaken practice.

**basic**: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%  
- At a basic level, students start to grasp fundamental concepts more securely and might perform the simple algebra correctly. However, occasional lapses in attention (leading to errors like Option A) or misunderstandings (such as Options C and D) can still occur. The distribution reflects a growing understanding but still, some susceptibility to errors.

**proficient**: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%  
- At the proficient level, most students should understand how to multiply out brackets correctly and apply the rules of signs properly. While some calculation errors might occur, these students generally exhibit a solid grasp of the algebra and understand negative number multiplication, reducing the frequency of these errors.

**advanced**: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%  
- Advanced students are expected to demonstrate a secure grasp of algebraic manipulations, including multiplying out brackets and correctly handling signs. While even advanced students may occasionally slip in calculation or make attentional errors, their understanding of mathematical concepts and rules should minimize the occurrence of such mistakes.

These predictions assume that students at higher levels have benefited from more practice and instruction, leading to fewer conceptual errors but still acknowledging the possibility of occasional mistakes due to inattention or computational slips.
