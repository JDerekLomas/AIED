To tackle this problem, we'll analyze each incorrect option by identifying the specific misconceptions or errors that could lead a student to choose it, assess how attractive each error is, and then predict the response distribution across different ability levels.

### Wrong Answer Options and Their Corresponding Misconceptions:

1. **Option B: \( \frac{7}{3x} \)**
   - **Misconception:** When adding fractions, adds the numerators and denominators. This is a known misconception where the student fails to find a common denominator before adding the fractions.
   - **Attractiveness:** Moderately attractive. This mistake feels like a straightforward application of addition, which might not immediately appear wrong to some students, especially those who haven't fully grasped fraction addition rules.
   - **Likely ability levels:** below_basic, basic. Students at these levels are more likely to apply basic arithmetic operations without fully understanding the underlying rules for fractions.

2. **Option C: \( \frac{11}{x} \)**
   - **Misconception:** Ignoring the different denominators and directly adding the numerators without considering the need for a common denominator, and possibly multiplying the denominators without adjusting the numerators accordingly.
   - **Attractiveness:** Less attractive than B because it implies a basic misunderstanding of adding fractions. A student choosing this might be applying incorrect rules without full understanding.
   - **Likely ability levels:** below_basic. This error is quite basic and doesn't show an understanding of fractions, likely indicating a student who hasn't grasped fundamental fraction concepts.

3. **Option D: \( \frac{7}{2x} \)**
   - **Misconception:** Incorrectly finding a common denominator or misapplying the rule for adding fractions. For example, correctly finding a common denominator of \(2x\) but then incorrectly calculating the new numerators (e.g., not correctly converting \(\frac{4}{x}\) to have a denominator of \(2x\)).
   - **Attractiveness:** Reasonably attractive. This mistake could arise from a nearly correct application of the rules for adding fractions, which suggests the student understands the need for a common denominator but perhaps made a calculation error.
   - **Likely ability levels:** basic, proficient. This error might occur in students who understand the basic rules for adding fractions but haven't practiced enough to avoid simple calculation mistakes.

### Correct Answer:
The correct approach involves finding a common denominator and then adding the fractions: 
\[
\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4 \cdot 2}{x \cdot 2} = \frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}
\]

### response distribution prediction:

- **below_basic:** A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
  - Students at this level are more prone to basic misconceptions about fractions, like adding numerators and denominators directly or completely misunderstanding fraction addition.
  
- **basic:** A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
  - Basic students start to apply rules more correctly but can still fall into misconceptions like incorrect common denominator calculations or misunderstandings in applying fraction rules.
  
- **proficient:** A=70% B=5% C=5% D=20%
  - Proficient students mainly understand how to add fractions correctly but might still make calculation errors, leading to incorrect options like D.
  
- **advanced:** A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
  - Advanced students are very likely to apply fraction addition rules correctly, with mistakes being very rare and usually resulting from calculation errors rather than underlying misconceptions about fractions.
