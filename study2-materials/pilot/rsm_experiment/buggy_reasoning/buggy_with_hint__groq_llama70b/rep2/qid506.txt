To analyze the given equation and the distractors, we'll follow the steps provided.

### Equation Analysis
The equation provided is \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\). To solve for \(p\), one must apply the inverse operation of multiplication, which is division. Thus, the correct solution is:
\[p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}\]

### Buggy Reasoning for Each Wrong Answer Option

1. **Option A (\(p = \frac{1}{4}\))**: This error is caused by the known misconception of "using the same operation rather than the inverse." In solving the equation \(3p = \frac{1}{12}\), a student with this misconception might attempt to solve it by performing the same operation on both sides without realizing the need for an inverse operation, possibly attempting something like \(p = 3 \times \frac{1}{12}\) and incorrectly simplifying it or misunderstanding the division as multiplication.

2. **Option B (\(p = \frac{1}{36}\))**: Actually, this is the correct answer. However, if we were to analyze an incorrect reasoning leading to another answer being mistakenly identified as \(\frac{1}{36}\), it might involve correctly applying the inverse operation (division by 3) but let's move on to actual errors.

3. **Option C (\(p = 4\))**: This error could arise from a misunderstanding or a miscalculation, such as misinterpreting the division as multiplication or ignoring the fraction altogether. The attraction to this mistake might be low for most students except perhaps those with significant difficulties in understanding operations with fractions or an error in transcription.

4. **Option D (\(p = \frac{1}{9}\))**: This might stem from a partial application of the correct process, where the student attempts to divide \(\frac{1}{12}\) by 3 but does so incorrectly or only partially. This could involve a mistake in calculating the division of fractions.

### Attractions of Errors

- **Option A (\(p = \frac{1}{4}\))**: Moderately attractive, especially for students who struggle with understanding the concept of inverse operations in equation solving.
- **Option C (\(p = 4\))**: Less attractive, likely a significant error noticed by most students unless there's a severe misunderstanding of fractions or a careless mistake.
- **Option D (\(p = \frac{1}{9}\))**: Fairly attractive, particularly if a student attempts to apply a correct method but makes a calculation error.

### Response Distribution Prediction

Given the nature of these questions, the predictions are as follows:

- **Below Basic**:
  - A = 40% (common misunderstanding of inverse operations)
  - B = 10% (since correct, fewer would accidentally choose this)
  - C = 20% (due to confusion or significant calculation errors)
  - D = 30% (from attempting correct process with a calculation mistake)

- **Basic**:
  - A = 30% (misunderstanding inverse operations but some are improving)
  - B = 20% (some correctly apply methods but others not)
  - C = 10% (significant errors less common as understanding improves)
  - D = 40% (attempts at correct process with fewer but still some mistakes)

- **Proficient**:
  - A = 10% (remaining misunderstandings of inverse operations)
  - B = 60% (increased application of correct methods)
  - C = 5% (rare instances of significant errors)
  - D = 25% (minor calculation errors during application)

- **Advanced**:
  - A = 5% (very few conceptual misunderstandings)
  - B = 80% (solid understanding and application of methods)
  - C = 1% (nearly eliminated significant errors)
  - D = 14% (rare instances of minor calculation mistakes)

Note: The percentages are hypothetical and based on a qualitative judgment of how attractive each type of error might be to students of different abilities.
