To address the question, let's break down the task into the required steps:

### 1. Identifying Buggy Reasoning for Each Wrong Answer Option

- **Option B (\( \frac{c+4}{h+4} \))**: The misconception here could be adding 4 to both the numerator and the denominator to maintain a perceived balance, possibly stemming from confusing the operation outside the parentheses (division) with the operation inside (addition). This could also arise from a misconception that equivalent ratios can be formed by adding the same number to both the numerator and the denominator in any context, not just for equivalence but for simplification or evaluation.

- **Option C (\( \frac{c}{h}+4 \))**: This directly corresponds with the provided misconception: "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order." This means the student incorrectly applies operations without following the order of operations (often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), leading them to divide before adding, and then separately adding 4 as if it's not part of the division operation.

- **Option D (\( \frac{h+4}{c} \))**: The error here might involve inverting the division. The student understands the need to involve \(h+4\) and \(c\) in a division but incorrectly places \(c\) as the divisor and \(h+4\) as the dividend, possibly due to misunderstanding or misremembering the original expression.

### 2. Judging Attractiveness and Error Probability

- **Option B**: This error feels somewhat reasonable as students early on might believe in a sort of 'balancing' act when seeing operations inside parentheses, but as students progress, this should become less attractive. Attractiveness level: 6/10 (most likely in below-basic and possibly basic levels).

- **Option C**: This mistake is very naturally tempting due to the common misunderstanding of left-to-right operation performance without considering the order of operations. Attractiveness level: 9/10 (highly attractive in below-basic and basic levels and can persist into proficient levels if not explicitly addressed).

- **Option D**: Inverting division might seem less likely for those familiar with basic algebra conventions. However, it's still tempting, especially if students don't carefully read or recall expressions. Attractiveness level: 5/10 (more typical in below-basic levels, becoming less common as understanding of algebraic notation improves).

### 3. Predicting Response Distribution

**Below BasicLevel**: 
- A=20% (little knowledge of algebraic conventions)
- B=30% (erroneous balancing)
- C=40% (left-to-right operation misconception)
- D=10% (inverting division less common but still possible)

**BasicLevel**: 
- A=50% (start to understand algebraic notation)
- B=20% (some still use balancing)
- C=20% (left-to-right error starts to diminish)
- D=10% (inversion diminishing)

**ProficientLevel**: 
- A=80% (good grasp of conventions)
- B=10% (some residual balancing errors)
- C=5% (left-to-right misconception less common)
- D=5% (inversion rare)

**AdvancedLevel**: 
- A=95% (-strong grasp of conventions)
- B=2% (rare balancing error)
- C=1% (very rare left-to-right misconception)
- D=2% (inversion very uncommon)
