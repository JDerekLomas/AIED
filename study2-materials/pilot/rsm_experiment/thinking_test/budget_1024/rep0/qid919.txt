Thinking about the student experience across 200 Year 9 mock papers for this specific substitution question:

*   **The Trap of $0.3^2$:** This is the primary hurdle. Many students instinctively think $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ because they know $3 \times 3 = 9$. This makes **Option D (2.7)** a very attractive distractor.
*   **The BIDMAS/BODMAS Error:** A significant number of lower and middle-ability students will multiply before squaring ($3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$; then $0.9^2 = 0.81$). This makes **Option A (0.81)** a high-frequency wrong answer for those who have a loose grasp of the order of operations.
*   **Doubling vs Squaring:** Lower ability students still frequently confuse $x^2$ with $2x$. Calculating $3 \times (0.3 \times 2)$ or $(3 \times 0.3) \times 2$ leads to **Option C (1.8)**.
*   **The "Proficient" Struggle:** Proficient students know to square first, but the decimal placement in $0.09$ is where they slip. If they realise $0.3^2$ is small, they might still second-guess whether it's $0.9$ or $0.09$.

Below are the predicted percentages based on marking these mock exams:

basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=15% B=55% C=5% D=25%
