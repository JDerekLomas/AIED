To answer this question accurately, I have considered the most common pitfalls encountered by Year 9 students. The primary traps are: 
1. **Multiplication instead of Power:** Lower-ability students often multiply the base by the index ($3 \times 4 = 12$).
2. **The "Persistent Negative" Sign:** A very high number of students believe that if the input is negative, the output must remain negative, regardless of the even exponent.
3. **Calculator Syntax:** Students who use a calculator often type $-3^4$ without brackets, which yields $-81$, reinforcing the misconception that the answer should be negative.

Based on my marking of these 200 papers, here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=2% C=32% D=1%
advanced: A=97% B=0% C=3% D=0%
