As a UK maths teacher, having marked hundreds of these Year 9 algebra questions, here is the breakdown of how students typically perform. 

The most common "trap" is Option A. Students often see the numbers 3 and 12 and immediately associate them with the number 4 ($12 \div 3 = 4$). Even those who know they should divide by 3 frequently divide the denominator instead of multiplying it, or instinctively "simplify" the relationship between 3 and 12. Option C is a common "low-ability" error where students ignore the fraction structure entirely.

below_basic: A=35% B=10% C=50% D=5%
basic: A=55% B=20% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=30% B=65% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=5% B=94% C=0% D=1%
