To provide these predictions, I’ve considered the typical stumbling blocks for Year 9 students regarding algebraic notation and the "grammar" of maths.

**The "Attractiveness" of wrong answers:**
*   **C ($\frac{c}{h} + 4$):** This is the most "attractive" error. Students often forget that the vinculum (fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol. Those with a loose grasp of BIDMAS often assume the division only applies to the term immediately following it, or they strip the brackets away mentally once the $\div$ symbol is gone.
*   **D ($\frac{h+4}{c}$):** This is the classic "divisor goes on top" error. Students often reflexively put the "heavier" or more complex expression on top, or simply struggle with the left-to-right translation into vertical fractions.
*   **B ($\frac{c+4}{h+4}$):** This is a specific misconception where students over-apply the rule of "doing the same to the top and bottom," treating the expression like a fraction they are trying to simplify or balance.

**Student Performance Profiles:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often pick D (reversal) or B (searching for symmetry).
*   **Basic:** Heavily drawn to C; they recognize algebra uses fractions but don't understand that the fraction bar replaces the bracket's function.
*   **Proficient:** Should identify A, though some will still make a "silly slip" and pick D.
*   **Advanced:** Should find this question trivial; any errors here are usually down to rushing or misreading.

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=55% B=5% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=82% B=2% C=10% D=6%
advanced: A=97% B=0% C=2% D=1%
