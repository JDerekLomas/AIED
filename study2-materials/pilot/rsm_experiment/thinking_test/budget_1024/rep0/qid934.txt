As an experienced teacher, marking these Year 9 mock papers often reveals the same patterns. The equation $4x + 2y = 10$ with $x=0$ is a classic test of whether a student understands the concept of a null term ($4 \times 0$) versus those who treat "nothing" as "one" or simply shuffle the numbers available to them.

**Calculation Errors and Traps:**
*   **The "Linear Skip" (B):** This is the most "attractive" wrong answer. Students often find $y$ when $x=1$ instead of $x=0$ because they mentally start the sequence at 1. If $x=1$, then $4(1) + 2y = 10 \Rightarrow 2y = 6 \Rightarrow y = 3$. Students seeing a table often start calculating the "rate of change" immediately rather than looking at the specific value for zero.
*   **The "Number Jumble" (D):** Below-basic students often ignore the variables and look at the constants. Seeing a 4 and a 10 leads them to $10 \div 4 = 2.5$. This feels "mathsy" enough to be right for a student who doesn't understand substitution.
*   **The "Multiplier" (A):** Occasionally, students see $4$, $2$, and $y$ and instinctively multiply $2 \times 10$ because they are confused by the structure of the equation.
