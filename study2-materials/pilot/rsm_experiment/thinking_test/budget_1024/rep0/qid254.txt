Thinking Process:

1.  **Analyze the Question & Options:**
    *   Data: $0, 1, 3, 4, 7$ (Total count $n = 5$, Sum $= 15$, Mean $= 3$)
    *   **A: $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$** - This is mathematically **correct**. Including 0 in the sum doesn't change the numerator, but it must be included in the denominator count.
    *   **B: $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$** - Incorrect due to Order of Operations (BIDMAS). This calculates $0+1+3+4+(7 \div 5) = 9.4$. This is a very common way students write calculations on paper even if they intend to divide the whole sum.
    *   **C: $\frac{1+3+4+7}{4}$** - Incorrect. This is the most common conceptual error: ignoring the zero when counting how many numbers there are.
    *   **D: None of them** - Attractive to students who think A is wrong because the '0' is missing from the numerator, but realize B and C are wrong.

2.  **Evaluate Student Levels (UK Year 9 Mock context):**
    *   **Below Basic:** Will likely struggle with the concept of mean or order of operations. B looks "natural" because it's written in the order you'd say it. C is a very high lure.
    *   **Basic:** Generally know "add them up and divide," but the "0" is a massive stumbling block. Many believe zeros are disregarded entirely in averages. They often fall for the formatting of B.
    *   **Proficient:** Understand that the count must be 5. Some might be hesitant about A because the 0 isn't explicitly shown in the sum, possibly leading them to pick D.
    *   **Advanced:** Will recognize that $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$ is equivalent to $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$. They will spot the BIDMAS error in B and the divisor error in C.

3.  **Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=15% B=40% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=25% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=1% D=5%
