To arrive at these percentages, I have considered the typical performance of Year 9 students under exam conditions on a standard BIDMAS/Order of Operations comparison.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **The "Left-to-Right" Trap (LHS):** Many students in the lower brackets will ignore the priority of division over addition. They calculate the Left Hand Side as $8 + 12 = 20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$. Because the Right Hand Side also equals $5$, Option C ($=$) is an incredibly "sticky" and attractive distractor for those who lack fluency in BIDMAS.
*   **The Comparison Confusion (Option B):** Students who realize the answers are different but struggle with basic arithmetic (e.g., $12 \div 4 = 4$) might occasionally find the RHS larger, or simply confuse the greater-than/less-than symbols.
*   **Proficiency Level:** Proficient students usually recognize that brackets change the outcome but are still prone to a "careless" left-to-right calculation on the LHS when tired.
*   **Advanced Level:** These students should see the structure immediately. They know LHS involves $8 + 3$ and RHS involves $20 \div 4$. Anything other than A would be a rare transcription error.
