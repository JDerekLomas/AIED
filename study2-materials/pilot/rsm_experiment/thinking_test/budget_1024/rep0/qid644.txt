The specific calculation error for each wrong answer is:
* **B (-4):** The most common error in bracket expansion. Students correctly identify that $1 \times 4 = 4$ but incorrectly apply the rules for signs, either thinking a "negative and a negative stays negative" (confusing it with addition) or simply neglecting the signs until the end.
* **C (+5):** An operation error. Students see the numbers 1 and 4 and perform addition rather than the required multiplication. 
* **D (-5):** A combination error. Students add the terms $(-1) + (-4)$ instead of multiplying them. This is a very "attractive" wrong answer for lower-ability students because, during the FOIL/Grid method, they are often mentally preparing to "combine" or "collect" terms.

Which students catch themselves? Advanced students recognize that the product of two negatives must be positive. Proficient students usually remember the "two negatives make a plus" rule but may still make a "slip" under exam pressure. Basic and Below Basic students frequently mix up the rules for adding negative numbers and multiplying them.

below_basic: A=20% B=35% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=1% D=4%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
