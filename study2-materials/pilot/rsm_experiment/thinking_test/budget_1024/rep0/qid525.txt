As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have marked thousands of questions on fraction arithmetic. The addition of mixed numbers is a classic "separator" question in Year 9. 

Here is my prediction of the results based on the most common misconceptions:

**Specific Errors & Trap Analysis:**
*   **The "Add Straight Across" Error (Option D):** This is the most prevalent misconception in the bottom two quartiles. Students add the whole numbers ($2+2=4$), then add the numerators ($7+1=8$) and denominators ($10+4=14$). It feels "logical" to a student who lacks conceptual understanding of equivalent fractions.
*   **The "Stop Halfway" Error (Option A):** This occurs when a student successfully converts the numbers to improper fractions ($\frac{27}{10} + \frac{9}{4}$), finds a common denominator, and gets $\frac{99}{20}$, but fails to read the final part of the instruction: "Leave your answer as a mixed number."
*   **The Common Denominator Struggle (Option C):** Students often decide the denominator must be 40 (by multiplying 10 and 4), but then get lost in the conversion process or simply guess a numerator that looks "mathsy" once they realise their calculation has gone awry.
*   **The Mastery Path (Option B):** This requires finding a common denominator (either 20 or 40), successfully converting numerators, adding, and then converting back to a mixed number or simplifying.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=5% B=10% C=25% D=60%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%

**Reasoning:**
*   **Below Basic:** Most will default to adding all the digits in the fraction part separately (Option D). 
*   **Basic:** This group is split; some have learned the "straight across" method is wrong but lack the stamina to find a common denominator correctly, while others will do the work but fail to convert back to a mixed number (A).
*   **Proficient:** These students know the method well. Their biggest pitfall isn't the maths; it’s the "exam technique" of missing the specific instruction to provide a mixed number, leading them to Option A.
*   **Advanced:** These students usually perform a "sanity check" (i.e., $2 + 2 = 4$, plus some fractions, so it must be roughly 5). They rarely fall for D and usually read the formatting instruction.
