To provide these predictions, I have considered the classic misconceptions encountered when Year 9 students solve linear equations involving fractions and inverse operations.

*   **Step 1 ($15 = \frac{1+k}{4} \rightarrow 60 = 1+k$)** is a correct multiplication of both sides by 4. Most students find this intuitive, though some low-ability students struggle with the fraction bar.
*   **Step 2 ($60 = 1+k \rightarrow 61 = k$)** is a common error. Instead of subtracting 1 from 60 (the inverse of +1), students frequently add the numbers together. This "addition bias" is an incredibly attractive trap, especially when students are working quickly.
*   **"Proficient" students** usually understand inverse operations but are the most likely group to make a "careless" error by choosing **C**, simply because they see 60 and 1 and their brain defaults to 61 without checking the sign.
*   **"Below Basic" students** often choose **D** if they don't understand that a fraction signifies division, leading them to believe Step 1 is inherently wrong.

Based on 200 mock papers, here is the predicted percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=45% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=5% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=2% C=25% D=3%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=4% D=1%
