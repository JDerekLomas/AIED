The calculation required is $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$. This simplifies to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, resulting in $x = 3.3$.

*   **Error for D (2.7):** This is the most common process error. Students substitute correctly ($10x - 3 = 30$) but then subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it when moving it across the equals sign ($10x = 27 \implies x = 2.7$).
*   **Error for A (4.25):** Students often struggle with the structure of the equation. Some may attempt to add all the numbers seen ($30 + 6 + 6 + 0.5 = 42.5$) and divide by 10. Others may perform $30 \div 6 = 5$ and then try to "adjust" using the $0.5$ and the $10$, landing on $4.25$ by essentially guessing or using incorrect inverse operations.
*   **Error for B (-4.25):** This is a distractor for those who think the answer must be negative because of the minus sign in the equation but are otherwise guessing.
