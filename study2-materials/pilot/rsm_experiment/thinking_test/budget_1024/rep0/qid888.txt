Based on marking Year 9 mock papers, this question primarily tests the ability to manipulate directed numbers (negatives) during expansion. 

The "attractors" here are:
- **D**: The most common error. Students correctly sum $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12m$ but incorrectly decide that a negative times a negative is a negative for the final term.
- **A**: Students who incorrectly "find the difference" between 5 and 7 ($7 - 5 = 2$) rather than summing them.
- **C**: Students who apply the "two negatives make a positive" rule indiscriminately to both the addition and the multiplication.

Below are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
