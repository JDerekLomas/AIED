As an experienced teacher, marking this question across the Year 9 cohort reveals common misconceptions regarding the reciprocal and the multiplication of directed numbers.

The "Attractive" Error: **Option B** is the most significant trap. Students often learn "flip it" for reciprocals and "two negatives make a positive" simultaneously. Many students mistakenly believe that to keep the answer negative, they need more negative signs, or they reflexively provide the "negative reciprocal" as if they are working with perpendicular gradients in coordinate geometry.

**Breakdown of Errors:**
- **A (Correct):** Students recognize that the product is -1, and since they already have one negative factor (-3/4), the second factor must be positive to maintain the negative sign ($ - \times + = - $).
- **B (Sign Error):** This is the most common mistake for "Basic" and "Proficient" students who know they need the reciprocal but over-apply the "negative stays negative" rule or mix up the rules for multiplication ($ - \times - = + $).
- **C & D (Inverse Error):** These students often lack the concept of a multiplicative inverse and are instead trying to reach 0 or simply guessing using the numbers present in the question.

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 mock papers:

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=45% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=65% B=25% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=94% B=5% C=1% D=0%
