As a UK maths teacher marking Year 9 mock papers, I have seen these specific misconceptions play out thousands of times. The acronym **BIDMAS** (or BODMAS) is a "double-edged sword": while it helps students remember to multiply before adding, it actively misleads them into thinking addition must occur before subtraction.

In **Problem P**, the "A before S" trap in the acronym leads many students to mistakenly calculate $5+6$ first.
In **Problem Q**, the "left-to-right" instinct often battles against the rule for multiplication.

Here is the predicted distribution based on 200 Year 9 papers:

**below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=10% D=30%**
*Reasoning:* These students mostly calculate left-to-right for both problems (Option A). They lack a firm grasp of precedence rules. Some have heard of BIDMAS but apply it sporadically, leading to the distribution across other options.

**basic: A=25% B=30% C=5% D=40%**
*Reasoning:* These students have "learned" BIDMAS but often follow the letters literally. They recognize multiplication comes first in Q, but the literal interpretation that "A" comes before "S" makes Option D very attractive. This is the level where the "A before S" misconception is most prevalent.

**proficient: A=10% B=55% C=0% D=35%**
*Reasoning:* Most proficient students know to multiply first in Q (eliminating A and C). However, the $4-5+6$ trap is notorious; even mid-to-high ability Year 9s frequently default to the literal order of the mnemonic (Addition then Subtraction) rather than the left-to-right rule for equal priority operations.

**advanced: A=0% B=92% C=0% D=8%**
*Reasoning:* These students understand that Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and that the acronym is just a memory aid. Only a small percentage might make a "lapse in concentration" error by overthinking the BIDMAS letters.
