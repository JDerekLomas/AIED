Thinking about the Year 9 cohort's typical performance on "Change of Subject" with complex formulas:

*   **The Trap (Option A/B):** The most common error in Year 9 is the "shunting" error—students see $\frac{4}{3}$ and $\pi$ and move them as a block without correctly applying the inverse operation (reciprocals). Many students incorrectly think that because the 3 is on the bottom in the volume formula, it stays on the bottom in the radius formula (Option B). 
*   **The Struggle with Pi:** Many lower-ability students treat $\pi$ as a label rather than a number to be divided, often leading to it staying in the numerator because "that's where it usually is."
*   **Order of Operations:** Advanced students consistently remember that the cube root is the final step, whereas less confident students may try to square root or get the radical sign confused with the coefficient (Option D).

Here is the predicted distribution of answers:

below_basic: A=35% B=30% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=25% C=60% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=5% C=92% D=1%
