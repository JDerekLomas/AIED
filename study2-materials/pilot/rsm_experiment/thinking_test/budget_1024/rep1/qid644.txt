To predict the results for this Year 9 mock question, I have evaluated the common misconceptions regarding directed numbers and the mechanics of expanding brackets.

### Calculation Errors & Trap Analysis
*   **The Trap of Addition (D):** Students at the "Below Basic" and "Basic" levels frequently confuse the rules for multiplying negatives with adding negatives. They see $-1$ and $-4$ and mentally process it as $-1 - 4 = -5$. This is the most "attractive" error because the numbers look like a simple sum.
*   **The Sign Error (B):** This is the classic mistake for "Proficient" students working too quickly. They know to multiply ($1 \times 4 = 4$) but either believe "a negative and a negative stay negative" or simply forget to apply the sign rule.
*   **The Inverse Addition Error (C):** Students who think the answer should be $5$ but struggle with the concept of "two negatives make a positive" in an addition context ($1 + 4 = 5$).
*   **The Correct Calculation (A):** Requires two distinct steps: knowing to multiply (expanding) and knowing the specific sign rule ($- \times - = +$).

### Predicted Performance
below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=82% B=12% C=1% D=5%
advanced: A=97% B=2% C=0% D=1%
