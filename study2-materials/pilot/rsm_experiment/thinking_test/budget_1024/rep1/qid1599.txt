In Year 9, this question tests the transition from arithmetic notation to algebraic "fraction-bar" notation. The key concept being tested is that the vinculum (the fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol, replacing the need for parentheses.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option C (The Order of Operations Trap):** This is the most common error. Students remember BIDMAS/BODMAS but fail to realise the fraction bar groups the entire denominator. They see "$c \div h$" and then "+ 4" separately.
*   **Option D (The Reciprocal Error):** Students often confuse the "dividend" and "divisor." In their heads, they sometimes read this as "h + 4 goes into c," leading them to put the larger-looking expression on top.
*   **Option B (Visual Pattern Matching):** Generally chosen by students who have very little algebraic understanding and are simply looking for a more "complex-looking" fraction that contains all the symbols they see in the prompt.

**Predicted Performance:**
