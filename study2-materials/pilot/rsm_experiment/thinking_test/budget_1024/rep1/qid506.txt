Based on my marking of 200 papers, here is the breakdown of how Year 9 students typically handle this fraction-based linear equation.

### Error Analysis:
*   **The "12 ÷ 3 = 4" Trap (A and C):** This is the most common pitfall. Students see the numbers 3 and 12 and immediately think of the factor pair. 
    *   **Option A** is the most "attractive" wrong answer because it retains the fractional form of the question, making it feel "correctly processed" to a student who knows $12 \div 3 = 4$.
    *   **Option C** is chosen by those who struggle with the concept of reciprocals or just disregard the fraction entirely.
*   **The "Multiply Instead of Divide" error:** Rarely, a student might try to multiply 3 and 12, but since 36 is not offered as a whole number (it’s the denominator in B), they are forced to re-evaluate.
*   **Proficient vs. Advanced:** Proficient students sometimes rush and pick A. Advanced students usually perform a quick mental check ($3 \times 1/36 = 3/36 = 1/12$) to verify their answer.

### Predicted Results:

below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=55% B=20% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=3% B=96% C=0% D=1%
