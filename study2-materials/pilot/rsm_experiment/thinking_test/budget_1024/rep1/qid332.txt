Thinking Process:

1.  **Analyze the Question:**
    *   Equation: $\frac{x}{3} - 5 = 12$
    *   Tom's step: $\frac{x}{3} = 17$ (Correct: added 5 to both sides first).
    *   Katie's step: $x - 5 = 36$ (Incorrect: multiplied by 3 but failed to multiply the $-5$ term; the correct result of multiplying by 3 first would be $x - 15 = 36$).
    *   Correct Answer: **A (Only Tom)**.

2.  **Evaluate Student Mistakes & Behavior (UK Year 9 Context):**
    *   **The Trap:** Katie's error is one of the most persistent misconceptions in algebra. Many students believe "multiplying by the denominator" simply cancels the fraction and leaves everything else alone. They see $12 \times 3 = 36$ and think it's perfectly valid.
    *   **Below Basic:** Often pick C because "both ways look like things you do in maths." They lack the conceptual understanding that a multiplier must apply to all terms in an equation.
    *   **Basic:** They recognize Tom's method is the "standard" one taught (bidmas in reverse/isolating the variable term). However, a large portion will see Katie's "multiplied by 3" as a creative but valid alternative because they often forget the distribution of the multiplier.
    *   **Proficient:** Usually identify Tom as correct immediately. Many will spot Katie's error, though some still fall for the "visual logic" of Katie's calculation (the $3$ and $36$ link is very strong).
    *   **Advanced:** Will almost all correctly identify A. They understand that to multiply by 3, you must multiply *every* term. They might only get it wrong if they rush and don't look closely at Katie's constant term.

3.  **Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=50% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%
