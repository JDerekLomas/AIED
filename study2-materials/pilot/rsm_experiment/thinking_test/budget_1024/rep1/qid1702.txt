Based on my experience marking thousands of these "linear equations and substitution" questions, Year 9 students often struggle with the dual process of substituting a decimal and rearranging an equation that contains a subtraction sign.

Here is the breakdown of the distractors:
- **C (3.3):** The correct answer. Students must calculate $6 \times 0.5 = 3$ and then solve $10x - 3 = 30$ by adding 3 to both sides to get $10x = 33$.
- **D (2.7):** The most common error ("The sign-swap trap"). Students substitute correctly to get $10x - 3 = 30$, but then instinctively subtract 3 from 30 because they see a subtraction sign in the original equation, or they incorrectly rearrange to $10x = 30 - 3$. 
- **B (-4.25):** The "Substitution Swap" error. Students put the $0.5$ into the $x$ column instead of the $y$ column. This gives $10(0.5) - 6y = 30$, leading to $5 - 6y = 30 \rightarrow -6y = 25 \rightarrow y = -4.16...$ Many students will pick -4.25 as the closest "calculated-looking" value if they make a slight division error (like $25 \div 6 \approx 4.25$).
- **A (4.25):** Usually a guess for students who find a negative number and assume they just have the sign wrong.
