As an experienced examiner marking Year 9 mocks, this question targets "Rearranging Equations involving powers and roots"—a topic where algebraic manipulation often breaks down even for students who know the formula.

In Year 9, many students can recall (or are provided with) $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. However, the rearrangement requires three distinct steps: multiplying by 3, dividing by $4\pi$, and cube-rooting the result.

**The calculation errors leading to distractors:**
*   **B is the "Fraction Fumble":** Students know they need to "get rid" of the $\frac{4}{3}$, but they fail to multiply by the reciprocal. They simply move the $4/3$ to the other side without flipping it, resulting in the constants remaining in their original positions.
*   **A is the "Operation Confusion":** Students often move $\pi$ to the other side via multiplication rather than division, or simply group all "known" symbols together at the top of a fraction.
*   **D is the "Incomplete Root":** This is a classic "Basic to Proficient" transition error. The student identifies the need for a cube root but only applies it to the $V$ or fails to recognize that the entire expression must be contained within the radical.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=35% B=30% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=4% C=92% D=3%
