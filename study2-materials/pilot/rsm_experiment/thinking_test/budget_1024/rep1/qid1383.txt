In my experience marking Year 9 mocks, this question targets two specific misconceptions: the confusion between indices and multiplication ($3 \times 4$ vs $3^4$) and the treatment of negative bases with even exponents.

The error leading to **B and D** is the most common at lower ability levels: students simply multiply the base by the power. The error leading to **C** is the most sophisticated mistake, often seen in "Proficient" students who know they need to calculate $3^4$ but believe that if the input is negative, the output must also be negative—a misconception frequently reinforced by incorrect calculator usage (entering $-3^4$ instead of $(-3)^4$).

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=65% B=5% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=5% D=0%
