Thinking about the "BODMAS/BIDMAS" acronym is the primary driver of errors here. 

For **Problem P**, the "A" comes before "S" in the acronym, which is one of the most persistent misconceptions in Key Stage 3. Students often believe they must perform addition before subtraction, even though they have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right. This makes "5+6" a very attractive "distractor" for Problem P.

For **Problem Q**, students who do not use BIDMAS at all will simply work left-to-right ("4+5"). Those with a basic grasp of order of operations will correctly identify that multiplication ("5x6") comes first.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown based on my experience marking Year 9 mocks:

below_basic: A=65% B=10% C=15% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=55% C=2% D=38%
advanced: A=0% B=92% C=0% D=8%
