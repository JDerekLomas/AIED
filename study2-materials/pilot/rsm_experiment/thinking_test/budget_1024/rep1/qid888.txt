As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen hundreds of students tackle binomial expansion. Here is the breakdown of the common pitfalls: 

*   **Option B (Correct):** Requires managing two negative signs simultaneously (the sum $-5-7=-12$ and the product $-5 \times -7 = +35$).
*   **Option D (The "Product Trap"):** This is the most common error. Students correctly identify $-12m$ but have a persistent misconception that a "negative times a negative stays negative" or simply forget to apply the rule to the constant term.
*   **Option A (The "Difference Trap"):** Students who see 5 and 7 and find the difference (2) instead of the sum, or accidentally calculate $+5 - 7$ instead of $-5 - 7$.
*   **Option C (The "Sign Blindness Trap"):** Usually chosen by lower-ability students who ignore the negative signs entirely and treat the problem as $(m+5)(m+7)$.

Below are the predicted percentages based on Year 9 mock performance:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
