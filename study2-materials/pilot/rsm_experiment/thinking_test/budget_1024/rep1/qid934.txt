The calculation required is to substitute $x=0$ into $4x + 2y = 10$. This results in $4(0) + 2y = 10$, which simplifies to $2y = 10$, and therefore $y = 5$.

Based on my marking of these mocks, here are the observed patterns:
*   **The "$4 \times 0 = 4$" Trap:** This is the most prevalent error for lower-attaining students. They treat the $0$ as a $1$ or simply bring the $4$ down, leading to $4 + 2y = 10$, which gives $2y = 6$, hence $y = 3$ (**Option B**).
*   **Coefficient Confusion:** Students who are confused by which number to divide by often take the $10$ and divide it by the coefficient of $x$, ignoring $y$ entirely, resulting in $10 \div 4 = 2.5$ (**Option D**).
*   **Calculation Slip (A):** Option A (**20**) is the "distractor" for those who multiply all the numbers they see ($4 \times 5$ or $2 \times 10$) without understanding the structure of the equation.
