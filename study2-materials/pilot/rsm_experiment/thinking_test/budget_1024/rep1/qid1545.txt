Based on marking Year 9 mock papers, this question specifically tests **BIDMAS/BODMAS** (Order of Operations). 

The primary trap here is the "left-to-right" calculation error on the left-hand side ($8 + 12 = 20 \div 4 = 5$). Students who make this mistake see $5 \square 5$ and almost universally choose **C**. Students who understand that the division must happen first on the left side calculate $8 + 3 = 11$, and $11 > 5$, leading to **A**. 

**Below Basic** students lack an understanding of operation priority and consistently read left-to-right, making the expressions appear identical in value. **Basic** students often know the acronym BIDMAS but fail to apply it if the sum "looks" simpler to do left-to-right. **Proficient** students usually catch the difference but a small percentage will flip the inequality sign. **Advanced** students perform these calculations mentally and with high accuracy.
