In marking these papers, the "Zero Misconception" is the most prevalent factor. Many students at lower ability levels treat zero as "nothing," leading them to believe it neither adds to the sum nor counts towards the total number of values. Option B is a classic BIDMAS (Order of Operations) trap that students who rely heavily on non-fractional calculator inputs fall into.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=60% D=5%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
