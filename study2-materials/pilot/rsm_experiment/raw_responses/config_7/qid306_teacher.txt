As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common student pitfalls regarding BIDMAS/BODMAS.

**Problem P** tests the "Addition before Subtraction" misconception. Students often believe that because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, they must add before they subtract, even though they have equal priority and should be done left-to-right.
**Problem Q** tests the standard hierarchy of Multiplication before Addition.

**Correct Answer: B** (Problem P: Left-to-right; Problem Q: Multiplication first).

**The Breakdown:**
*   **A (Double error):** Left-to-right on both.
*   **B (Correct):** Follows priority rules.
*   **C (BIDMAS Trap + Priority error):** Adds first in P (misconception) and left-to-right in Q.
*   **D (BIDMAS Trap):** Adds first in P because "A" is before "S", but correctly multiplies first in Q.

basic: A=25% B=30% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=1% D=7%
