As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this question based on the common pitfalls of Bidmas/Bodmas (Order of Operations) and decimal place value. 

The correct answer is **B (0.27)**, derived from $3 \times (0.3^2) = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$.

**The distractors target specific errors:**
*   **A (0.81):** The "left to right" misconception. The student calculates $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$.
*   **C (1.8):** Doubling instead of squaring. $3 \times (0.3 \times 2) = 1.8$, or a misplaced decimal in $3^2 \times 0.2$.
*   **D (2.7):** Decimal point error. Squaring 0.3 to get 0.9 (common) then multiplying by 3, or simply losing a place value ($3 \times 0.9$).

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
