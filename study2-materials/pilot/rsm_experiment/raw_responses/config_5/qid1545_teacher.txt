As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common student behaviours regarding BIDMAS (Order of Operations).

**The Correct Calculation:**
Left side: $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$
Right side: $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$
Correct Answer: **A ($11 > 5$)**

**The Misconception:**
Students who work strictly left-to-right on the left-hand side will calculate $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 5$. This leads them to conclude that $5 = 5$, choosing **C**.

basic: A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=13% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
