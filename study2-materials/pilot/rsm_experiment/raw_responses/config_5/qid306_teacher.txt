As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have analysed this question based on common student misconceptions regarding BIDMAS/BODMAS. 

The primary hurdle in **Problem P** is the "Addition before Subtraction" myth; many students believe that because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym, they must add $5+6$ first, rather than working left-to-right. In **Problem Q**, the misconception is the "Left-to-Right" bias, where students ignore operator precedence and add $4+5$ before multiplying.

**Option B** is the correct mathematical approach (Left-to-right for P, Multiplication first for Q).

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=35% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=15% B=65% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
