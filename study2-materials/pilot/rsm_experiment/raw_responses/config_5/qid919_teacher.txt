As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have analysed this question based on common student errors regarding BIDMAS (Order of Operations) and place value when squaring decimals.

The correct answer is **B ($0.27$)**, calculated as $3 \times (0.3^2) = 3 \times 0.09$.

The common misconception mentioned (left to right) leads to **A ($0.81$)**, where the student calculates $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2$. Option **D ($2.7$)** is a very common error where students square $0.3$ and get $0.9$ (forgetting the second decimal place) then multiply by $3$. Option **C ($1.8$)** usually stems from doubling instead of squaring ($3 \times 0.3 \times 2$).
