To predict the performance on this BIDMAS/Order of Operations question, we first solve the problem:
Left side: $8 + (12 \div 4) = 8 + 3 = 11$
Right side: $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 20 \div 4 = 5$
Since $11 > 5$, the correct answer is **A**.

**Misconceptions:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often work left-to-right regardless of operators ($8+12=20, 20\div4=5$), leading them to choose **C**.
*   **Basic:** May recognize brackets on the right but still struggle with order on the left, or guess randomly between the symbols.
*   **Proficient:** Generally understand BIDMAS but may make a mental arithmetic slip or forget that division precedes addition on the left side.
*   **Advanced:** Should consistently apply BIDMAS correctly to both sides.
