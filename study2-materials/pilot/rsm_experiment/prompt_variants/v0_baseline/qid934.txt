As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this linear algebra problem. The most common errors involve substituting $x=0$ but performing the wrong inverse operation (subtraction instead of division) or failing to substitute at all and just performing a calculation with the coefficients.

**Correct Calculation:**
When $x = 0$, $4(0) + 2y = 10 \Rightarrow 2y = 10 \Rightarrow y = 5$. (Option C)

**Predicted Distractors:**
*   **A (20):** Students multiply 4 by 5 (the answer) or simply do $10 \times 2$.
*   **B (3):** Common "visual" guess or a calculation error relating to the gap between 2, 4, and 10.
*   **D (2.5):** Students do $10 \div 4$ instead of $10 \div 2$.

Here is the predicted performance breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=55% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%
