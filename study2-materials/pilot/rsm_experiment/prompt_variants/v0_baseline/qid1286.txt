As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common algebraic misconceptions and students' familiarity with the sphere volume formula ($V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$).

Students at the **below_basic** level often struggle with rearranging formulae involving fractions and powers, frequently guessing or misplacing the $\pi$ and the 3. **Basic** level students often recognise the formula but commonly perform the inverse operation incorrectly (e.g., multiplying by 4 and dividing by 3 instead of vice versa). **Proficient** students usually navigate the algebraic steps correctly but may make a transcription error. **Advanced** students (Targeting Grade 7-9) almost always perform the three-step rearrangement ($3V$, then divide by $4\pi$, then cube root) correctly.

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=35% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
