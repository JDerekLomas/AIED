In this question, Isaac correctly performs Step 1 by multiplying both sides by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). However, in Step 2, he makes a common sign error: instead of subtracting 1 from 60 ($60 - 1 = 59$), he adds 1 to 60 to get 61. Therefore, only Step 1 is correct.

**Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the inverse operation of division and may incorrectly believe Step 1 is wrong, or they may see "61" and assume the arithmetic is correct without checking the inverse of addition.

**Basic:** Many students at this level recognize that $15 \times 4 = 60$, identifying Step 1 as correct. However, they frequently make the "inverse operation error" in Step 2, seeing $+1$ and thinking the next logical move involves 61, thus selecting "Both are correct."

**Proficient:** These students generally have a solid grasp of two-step equations. They will spot the sign error in Step 2 ($60 = 1 + k \implies k = 59$) and correctly identify that only Step 1 is valid.

**Advanced:** These students will instantly identify the error in Step 2 and are very unlikely to be fooled by the common addition mistake.
