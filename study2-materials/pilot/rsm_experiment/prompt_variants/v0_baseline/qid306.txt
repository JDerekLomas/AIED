As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on common misconceptions surrounding BODMAS/BIDMAS.

**Problem P** testing the "Left to Right" rule: Students often believe that because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, they must add before they subtract ($5+6$), rather than working left to right ($4-5$).
**Problem Q** testing Operation Hierarchy: Distinguishing between the stronger multiplication and the weaker addition.

below_basic: A=25% B=15% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=65% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
