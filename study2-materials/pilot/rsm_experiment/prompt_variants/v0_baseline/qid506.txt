As a UK maths teacher, I analyze this question as a test of inverse operations involving fractions. The most common misconception is "dividing 12 by 3" instead of "dividing 1/12 by 3" (Option A), followed by simply "multiplying 12 by 3" but keeping it as an integer (Option C).

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=35% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
