In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen expanding double brackets become a "benchmark" skill. While the mechanics of FOIL or the grid method are well-taught, the signs—specifically multiplying two negatives—remain the primary source of error. 

Option B is the correct answer. Option D is the most common "mechanical" error (getting the 12m right but failing the signs on the constant), while Option C is common for students who struggle with directed numbers. Option A is a classic "different signs" error where students subtract 5 from 7 instead of adding them.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=78% C=5% D=12%
advanced: A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
