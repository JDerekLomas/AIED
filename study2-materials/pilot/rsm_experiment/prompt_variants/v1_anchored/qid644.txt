In my experience teaching this across the GCSE years, the most significant hurdles here are the "double negative" multiplication and the common mistake of adding terms instead of multiplying them (leading to -5).

The arrows specifically isolate the numerical constants $-1$ and $-4$. While this should be a straightforward task of multiplication, students often revert to addition when they see two negative integers.

**below_basic:** A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
*(These students are guessing or misapplying the "two negatives make a positive" rule to addition. There is a high frequency of adding the numbers to get -5 or +5.)*

**basic:** A=45% B=15% C=10% D=30%
*(Basic students often know it is multiplication, but the distractors C and D (addition errors) are very common. Many will also miss the negative $\times$ negative = positive rule, opting for -4.)*

**proficient:** A=75% B=10% C=5% D=10%
*(Most proficient students correctly identify that -1 $\times$ -4 = 4. Errors are usually caused by rushing and adding to get -5 or forgetting the negative signs altogether.)*

**advanced:** A=96% B=2% C=0% D=2%
*(Advanced students rarely make errors on this specific part of the expansion. Any errors are typically "silly mistakes" where they accidentally add instead of multiply under pressure.)*
