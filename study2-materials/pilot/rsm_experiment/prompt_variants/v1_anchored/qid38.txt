In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen this specific algebraic fraction problem many times. The core difficulty lies in whether a student understands how to find a common denominator or simply "adds across."

Option A is the correct answer ($\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$).
Option B represents the "add across" error ($\frac{3+4}{2x+x} = \frac{7}{3x}$), which is the most common misconception.
Option D is the "lazy addition" error where students add the numerators but ignore the need to scale them when choosing $2x$ as the common denominator.
Option C represents a misunderstanding of how to manipulate the $x$ or a failure to account for the $2$.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=97% B=1% C=1% D=1%
