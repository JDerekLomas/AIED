In my experience teaching this across the ability range, this specific question is a "classic" trap. The most common error is the intuitive but incorrect operation of dividing 12 by 3 to get 4, leading to Option A or C. Even proficient students can slip up by multiplying the denominator by 3 incorrectly or attempting to "move" the 3 in a way that feels familiar rather than mathematically sound.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
