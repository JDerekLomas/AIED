To solve this problem, students must substitute $x = 0$ into the linear equation $4x + 2y = 10$. This results in $2y = 10$, meaning $y = 5$. 

Common misconceptions involve:
*   **Option A (20):** Students multiplying 4 by 5 (half of 10) or incorrectly combining all numbers in the equation.
*   **Option B (3):** Miscalculating the division or making a sign error/subtraction error.
*   **Option D (2.5):** Dividing 10 by 4 instead of 2, or confusing the coefficients.

In my 20 years of experience, students at the lower end often struggle with the implicit $4x$ (multiplication) or the fact that $y$ is not the subject of the formula. Many see $4x+2y=10$ and assume if $x=0$, then $2y=10$ implies $y$ must be $10-4$ or similar additive errors.
