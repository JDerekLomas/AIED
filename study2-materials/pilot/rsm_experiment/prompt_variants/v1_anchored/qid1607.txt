In this question, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4 gives $60 = 1 + k$). Step 2 is incorrect because the student added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting it (the correct answer should be $k = 59$).

As a UK teacher, I've seen thousands of students fall into the "inverse operation trap" where they perform the wrong operation when moving a term. While most students recognize Step 1 as a standard first move, a very high percentage of Basic and Below-basic students will see $60 = 1 + k$ and instinctively add the numbers together to get 61, failing to spot the error in Step 2.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=10% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=2% C=4% D=2%
