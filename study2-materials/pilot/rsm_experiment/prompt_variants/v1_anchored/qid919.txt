In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen students consistently struggle with the hierarchy of operations when coefficients are involved. For the equation \(y=3x^2\) where \(x=0.3\), the common pitfall is calculating \((3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81\) (Option A) or making decimal placement errors. 

The correct calculation is \(3 \times (0.3^2) = 3 \times 0.09 = 0.27\). 

Here is the predicted distribution of responses:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=20% B=65% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=92% C=1% D=2%
