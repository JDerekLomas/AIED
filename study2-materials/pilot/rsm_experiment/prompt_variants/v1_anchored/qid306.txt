In my experience, "BIDMAS" (or BODMAS) is one of the most consistently misunderstood topics. While most students remember that multiplication comes before addition (Problem Q), the misconception that addition must *always* come before subtraction (because 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym) is incredibly persistent, even among high-ability students. 

In Problem P, addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be done left-to-right ($4-5$ first). However, many students will incorrectly perform $5+6$ first.
