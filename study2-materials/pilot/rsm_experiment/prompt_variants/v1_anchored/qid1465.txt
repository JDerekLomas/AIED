In my 20 years in the classroom, I have found that BIDMAS (Order of Operations) remains one of the most persistent hurdles for students. Even higher-ability students can fall into the "left-to-right" trap if they are working too quickly.

**The Logic behind the Distractors:**
*   **A (6):** The correct answer ($3 - 5 + 8 \rightarrow -2 + 8 = 6$).
*   **B (4):** The most common procedural error. Students perform the addition before the subtraction ($3 - (5+4) \times 2 \rightarrow 3 - 9 \times 2$, but usually simplified as $3 - 9 + 8 = 2$ or more commonly $3 - 5 + 8$ but treating it as $3 - 13$ or forgetting the sign rules entirely). However, the main way students get 4 is by doing $3 - 5 = -2$, then $-2 + 4 = 2$, then $2 \times 2 = 4$ (working strictly left to right).
*   **C (-12):** Left-to-right processing with a sign error ($3 - 5 = -2$, $-2 + 4 = 2$, then somehow getting -12) or more commonly $(3-5+4) \times 2 = 2 \times 2 = 4$, but if they calculate $(3 - (5+4)) \times 2 \rightarrow (3-9) \times 2 = -12$.
*   **D (-10):** A common calculation error where students do $3 - 13$.
