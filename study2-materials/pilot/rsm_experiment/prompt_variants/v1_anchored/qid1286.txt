In my experience, this question assesses two distinct skills: recall of the sphere volume formula and the algebraic ability to rearrange a formula where the subject is cubed. Many students remember that 4, 3, and $\pi$ are involved, but they often struggle with whether to multiply or divide by the fraction $4/3$.

Option A is a common error where students multiply by the fraction instead of dividing by it. Option B is a "half-way" mistake where the student fails to move the 3 correctly. Option D is a typical error for those who don't understand that the cube root must apply to the entire expression.

The distribution of responses across the ability levels is likely as follows:

below_basic: A=28% B=26% C=22% D=24%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=10% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=94% D=1%
