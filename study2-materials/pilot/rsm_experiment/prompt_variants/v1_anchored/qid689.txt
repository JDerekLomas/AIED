In my 20 years in the classroom, I have seen thousands of students tackle this specific "unknown as denominator" problem. It is one of the most common pitfalls in KS3 and GCSE algebra.

Students frequently see the numbers 10 and 5 and intuitively perform the operation $10 \div 5$ (Option C) or $10 \times 5$ (Option B). Option C is the strongest distractor because students are conditioned to think the larger number must be divided by the smaller number to get an integer result. Only those who understand the structural rearrangement ($\text{multiply by } p$, then $\text{divide by } 10$) consistently reach the correct decimal answer.
