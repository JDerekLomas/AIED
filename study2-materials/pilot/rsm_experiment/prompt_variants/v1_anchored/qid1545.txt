In my 20 years in the classroom, I have seen this exact type of BIDMAS (Order of Operations) problem catch out students of all ages. 

The left-hand side is $8 + (12 \div 4) = 11$.
The right-hand side is $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 5$.
Therefore, $11 > 5$.

The most common error for **Below-basic** and **Basic** students is working strictly left-to-right on the first expression ($8+12 = 20$, $20 \div 4 = 5$), which leads them to conclude that both sides are equal (Option C). **Proficient** students occasionally rush and fall for the same trap, while **Advanced** students see the structure of the calculation immediately.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
basic: A=35% B=10% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=18% D=2%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
