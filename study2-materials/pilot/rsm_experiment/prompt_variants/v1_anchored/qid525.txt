In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen exactly how students handle this classic fraction addition. 

The main pitfalls here are option D (adding across the numerators and denominators: $7+1$ and $10+4$), and option A (converting to an improper fraction correctly but failing to follow the instruction to leave it as a mixed number). Below-basic students gravitate heavily toward option D because "adding across" is their most common misconception with fractions.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=15% D=45%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=20% B=75% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=5% B=94% C=1% D=0%
