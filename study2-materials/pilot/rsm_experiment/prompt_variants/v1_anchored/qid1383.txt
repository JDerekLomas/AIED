In my 20 years in the classroom, I've seen this exact question trip up even the most confident students. The "power of 4" is the first hurdle (many multiply $3 \times 4$), but the real "killer" is the negative sign. 

Below-basic students often treat $k^4$ as $k \times 4$, leading them to $12$ or $-12$. Basic students know it's a power but almost instinctively believe a negative base raised to any power stays negative. Proficient students understand the rule that an even power results in a positive value, but a significant minority still get caught by the "calculator error" logic ($ -3^4$ vs $(-3)^4$). Advanced students handle the index law and the sign correctly almost every time.

below_basic: A=20% B=35% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=22% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%
