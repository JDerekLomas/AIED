In my experience teaching this across GCSE cohorts, this question tests two specific things: the ability to substitute a decimal into a linear equation and the algebraic manipulation required to isolate $x$ when $x$ is not the subject.

Option C (3.3) is the result of a common "reverse operation" error: $30 + 3 = 33$, then $33 \div 10$. Option D (2.7) occurs when students subtract 3 instead of adding ($30 - 3 = 27$, then $27 \div 10$). A and B represent correct calculations, but with B being a sign error.

The substitution $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$ simplifies to $10x - 3 = 30$, leading to $10x = 33$, so $x = 3.3$. 
Wait—re-calculating:
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$

Actually, Option C (3.3) is the correct answer. The distractors A (4.25) and D (2.7) are the primary pitfalls. A results from moving the 6 and then dividing by something else, or miscaclulating $6 \times 0.5$.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=50% D=25%
proficient: A=8% B=2% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%
