As a UK maths teacher, I’ve evaluated this question based on common student behaviours in Key Stage 3 and GCSE foundation/higher tiers.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **The Trap of Option D:** This is the "classic" misconception where students add the numerators ($7+1$) and add the denominators ($10+4$). Lower-ability students are highly prone to this as it follows the intuitive (but incorrect) logic of multiplication.
*   **The Conversion Trap (A vs B):** The question explicitly asks for a **mixed number**. Even though $\frac{99}{20}$ is mathematically equivalent to the correct answer, students who convert everything to improper fractions first and forget to convert back will choose A. High-ability students rarely make this mistake, but mid-range students often do.
*   **Option C:** This represents a "mixed" error—finding the denominator by multiplying ($10 \times 4 = 40$) but then making a numerator error or simply guessing.
*   **The Difficulty:** Finding a common denominator for 10 and 4 ($20$) is slightly harder than when denominators are prime, as many students will default to $40$, leading to larger numbers and more chances for arithmetic slips.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=20% D=45%
basic: A=25% B=45% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=94% C=0% D=1%
