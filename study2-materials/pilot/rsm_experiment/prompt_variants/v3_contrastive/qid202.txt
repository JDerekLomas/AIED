This is a relatively straightforward addition of mixed numbers because the denominators are the same and the sum of the fractional parts does not exceed a whole. However, the specific options provided create distinct traps.

Option **D** is the classic "add the denominators" misconception. Option **B** is mathematically correct but violates the instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number. Option **C** combines both errors (adding the denominators and an incorrect conversion/multiplication).

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many students at this level intuitively add all four numbers they see ($2+1=3$ and $5+5=10$), making **D** a very high-frequency error. 
*   **Basic:** Students at this level often know to add the whole numbers and the numerators, but the presence of the improper fraction **B** will distract some who have been drilled in "top-heavy" fractions but fail to read the specific instruction for a "mixed number".
*   **Proficient:** These students will almost all reach the correct numerical value. A small percentage may select **B** if they are rushing and see a "correct" equivalent value before looking at the instruction.
*   **Advanced:** These students will read the full instruction and identify **A** immediately, rarely falling for the denominator trap.

below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=65% B=15% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=1% D=4%
advanced: A=97% B=2% C=0% D=1%
