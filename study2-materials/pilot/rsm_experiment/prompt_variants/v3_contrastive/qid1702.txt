To solve for the star ($x$), students must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$.
This gives: $10x - 6(0.5) = 30 \Rightarrow 10x - 3 = 30 \Rightarrow 10x = 33 \Rightarrow x = 3.3$.

**Analysis of Difficulty and Misconceptions:**
*   **The Decimal Trap:** Many students struggle with the multiplication of a whole number by $0.5$. However, the real "trap" here is the sign. A common error is calculating $10x + 3 = 30$, leading to $10x = 27$ and $x = 2.7$ (Option D).
*   **The Inversion Trap:** Lower-ability students often substitute the value into the wrong variable (substituting $0.5$ for $x$ instead of $y$). $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y \approx -4.16$. They then look for the closest value, which leads them to Option B.
*   **Operation Error:** Students who add 3 to 30 correctly but struggle with place value might pick 4.25 or other numbers if they attempt to divide by anything other than 10.
*   **Success Rate:** Because $10x$ is a "friendly" coefficient, the final step of dividing by 10 is easy. The difficulty lies entirely in the rearrangement and the negative sign handling.
