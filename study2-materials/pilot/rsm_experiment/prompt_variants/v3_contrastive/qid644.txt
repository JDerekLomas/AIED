As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've observed many students tackle the "FOIL" or grid method for expanding brackets. This specific question targets the "L" (Last terms) in FOIL: $(-1) \times (-4)$.

The difficulty here isn't the algebraic structure, but the basic integer arithmetic involving negative numbers. For "below basic" students, the two most common errors are adding the numbers instead of multiplying (getting 5 or -5) or failing to apply the rule that "two negatives make a positive" when multiplying. 

"Basic" level students usually know to multiply ($1 \times 4 = 4$), but many still struggle with the sign, often defaulting to a negative answer because there are minus signs in the brackets. "Proficient" and "Advanced" students typically handle the double negative correctly, as this is a heavily drilled skill at those levels.

Here is my prediction for the distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=55% B=35% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=12% C=2% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
