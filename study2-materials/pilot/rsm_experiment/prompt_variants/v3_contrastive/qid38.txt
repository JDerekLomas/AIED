To solve $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{4}{x}$, a student must find a common denominator (which is $2x$). This requires multiplying the second fraction by $\frac{2}{2}$, resulting in $\frac{3}{2x} + \frac{8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$ (Option A).

**Analysis:**
- **The "Add Everything" Error (Option B):** Adding numerators (3+4) and denominators (2x+x) gives $\frac{7}{3x}$. This is a very common intuitive error for lower-ability students.
- **The "Numerator Only" Error (Option D):** Some students recognize that $2x$ is a likely denominator but forget to scale the numerator of the second fraction, simply adding $3+4$ to get $\frac{7}{2x}$.
- **The "Missing 2" Error (Option C):** A few students might multiply both fractions or incorrectly resolve the denominator to $x$, leading to $\frac{11}{x}$.

This question is a classic "common denominator" test. The most common pitfall is Option D, as students often perform half the process (choosing the common denominator) but forget the balance (multiplying the 4 by 2).
