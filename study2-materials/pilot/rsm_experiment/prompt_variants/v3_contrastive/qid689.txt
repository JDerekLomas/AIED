This question is a classic test of algebraic manipulation involving denominators. The primary hurdle is that the variable $p$ is on the bottom of the fraction. 

Students at lower ability levels frequently default to "larger number divided by smaller number" ($10 \div 5 = 2$) regardless of position, leading them to Option C. Alternatively, those who recognise that they need to "undo" a division often perform the inverse operation on the wrong numbers, calculating $10 \times 5 = 50$, leading them to Option B.

Option A ($0.5$) requires either a formal algebraic approach ($10p = 5$, so $p = 5/10$) or strong numerical fluency to recognise that "5 divided by something equals 10" implies that "something" must be a half. Proficiency is measured by avoiding the "common sense" trap of $10 \div 5$.
