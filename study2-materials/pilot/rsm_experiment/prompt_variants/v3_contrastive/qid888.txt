This question tests the expansion of a double bracket with two negative constants, which is a classic area for sign errors in GCSE Mathematics.

The most common errors students make here are:
1.  **Multiplication of directed numbers:** Students correctly identify $-5 \times -7$ but result in $-35$ instead of $+35$ (Option D).
2.  **Addition of directed numbers:** Students incorrectly combine $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-2$ instead of $-12$ (Option A).
3.  **The "double negative makes a positive" over-generalisation:** Students assume that because both signs are negative, the middle term must be positive (Option C).

In my experience, even proficient students occasionally slip on the sign of the constant term (Option D) because they focus so hard on adding the numbers correctly for the middle term. Below-basic students often treat the expression as $(m-5)-(m-7)$ or simply ignore one of the signs entirely.

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=75% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
