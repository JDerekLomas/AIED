In this question, the student is asked to evaluate two distinct algebraic steps. 

Step 1 is correct: Isaac correctly multiplies both sides by 4 to clear the fraction ($15 \times 4 = 60$).
Step 2 is incorrect: Isaac attempts to isolate $k$ by moving the $+1$. However, instead of subtracting 1 from 60 (to get 59), he adds 1 to 60 (to get 61). This is a very common "inverse operation" error where students see a positive sign and perform addition rather than the inverse.

**Teacher's Insight:**
*   **Below Basic** students often struggle with the first step (fractions). Many might think Step 1 is wrong because they try to subtract 1 before multiplying by 4, or they multiply only one side. Many will guess C because they see "maths-looking" steps that seem plausible.
*   **Basic/Proficient** students usually recognise Step 1 is correct. However, Step 2 is a classic "trap." A significant portion of these students will skim the calculation $60+1=61$ and see it as "correct" without checking if the inverse operation (subtraction) was appropriate. 
*   **Advanced** students will systematically check both steps and identify the sign error in Step 2.
