This question specifically tests the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). The numbers are small and "friendly," but the structure is a classic trap. On the left side, the common error is performing addition before division ($8+12=20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$). On the right side, the brackets force the addition to happen first ($8+12=20$, then $20 \div 4 = 5$).

Students who lack a solid grasp of BIDMAS will likely calculate $5$ for both sides and conclude they are equal (Option C). This is the primary distractor for lower-ability students. Proficient students will correctly identify that the left side is $8+3=11$, while the right side is $5$, making the left side greater (Option A). Because "greater than" ($>$) and "less than" ($<$) are frequently confused by students with lower confidence, we see a spread in Option B for the basic tiers as well.
