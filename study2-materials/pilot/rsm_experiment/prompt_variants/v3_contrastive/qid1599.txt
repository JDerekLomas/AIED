This question tests the transition from arithmetic notation ($\div$) to algebraic notation (fraction bars). It also assesses the student's understanding of the order of operations when brackets are involved.

The main difficulty here is not the complexity of the numbers, but the spatial arrangement of the symbols. **Option D** is a very common "reversal" error for students who struggle with the numerator/denominator relationship. **Option C** is a classic error for students who ignore the brackets or don't understand that the fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol for the entire expression. **Option B** is a relatively rare "copying error" where students accidentally replace the variable with the constant in the numerator.

Because this question specifically uses brackets in the prompt, it guides the student toward seeing $(h+4)$ as a single unit, which actually makes the question easier than if it were $c \div h + 4$ or if the brackets were implied.
