This question specifically tests the understanding of the **multiplicative inverse (reciprocal)** combined with **directed number rules**. 

The main trap here is the sign. Many students correctly identify that to get a "1", they need the reciprocal $\frac{4}{3}$. However, because the target is negative ($ -1 $), lower-ability students often mistakenly believe they need a positive multiplier, forgetting that "negative times positive is negative." More advanced students occasionally overthink and select $ -\frac{4}{3} $ by instinctively reaching for the reciprocal without checking the final sign required. 

The simplicity of the number "1" makes this question slightly easier than if the target were a different fraction, but the "minus sign" at the start of the expression remains a high-frequency trigger for errors.
