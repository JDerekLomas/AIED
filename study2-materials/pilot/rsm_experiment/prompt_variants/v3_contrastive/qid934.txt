As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've analysed this question based on how students typically interact with linear equations and tables of values.

**Analysis of the Question:**
1.  **Implicit substitution:** The student must identify that the star corresponds to $x=0$.
2.  **Implicit vs Explicit form:** The equation $4x + 2y = 10$ is in implicit form. Most UK students are more comfortable with $y = mx + c$.
3.  **The "x=0" simplification:** This makes the $4x$ term disappear, leaving $2y = 10$. This is generally straightforward, but students often make "habit" errors.
4.  **Distractors:**
    *   **A (20):** Multiplying the coefficients ($4 \times 5$ or $2 \times 10$).
    *   **B (3):** Misinterpreting the gradient or intercept (solving for $x=1$ or $2$).
    *   **C (5):** The correct answer ($2y = 10$).
    *   **D (2.5):** Dividing the total by the larger coefficient ($10 \div 4$), or solving for the $x$-intercept when $y=0$.

**Student Performance Predictions:**
The $x=0$ case is the easiest to calculate, which mitigates the difficulty of the equation being in an implicit form. However, below-basic students often struggle with the "missing" $x$ or simply guess based on the numbers provided in the equation.

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=45% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=15% C=65% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=85% D=8%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=97% D=2%
