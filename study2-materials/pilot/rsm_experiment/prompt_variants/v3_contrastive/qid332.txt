This question specifically tests the order of operations when solving two-step equations and a very common student misconception regarding the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction.

Tom’s method is the standard approach (adding 5 to both sides). Most students, even at a lower level, recognize this as a valid first step. 

Katie’s method is where the discrimination occurs. Katie has multiplied by 3, but she failed to multiply the $-5$ by 3 (the correct line would be $x - 15 = 36$). Many "Basic" and "Below Basic" students fail to realize that when multiplying an equation by a denominator, *every* term on both sides must be multiplied. They see the $x/3$ becoming $x$ and the $12$ becoming $36$ and assume the operation is balanced. 

"Proficient" students usually recognise the mistake in Katie's logic because they have been taught to "do the same to everything." "Advanced" students will spot the error immediately.

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=75% B=2% C=20% D=3%
advanced: A=94% B=1% C=4% D=1%
