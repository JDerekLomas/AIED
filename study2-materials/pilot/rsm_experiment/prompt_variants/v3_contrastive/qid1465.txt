This question is a classic test of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). While it looks straightforward, it contains two distinct "trap" areas:
1.  **The Multiplicative Priority:** Students who read left-to-right without applying order of operations will calculate $(3-5+4) \times 2 = 4$ (Option B).
2.  **The Addition vs Subtraction Priority:** Even students who know to multiply first ($4 \times 2 = 8$) often fall into the "Addition before Subtraction" trap because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym. They calculate $3 - (5+8) = -10$ (Option D) instead of $(3-5) + 8 = 6$ (Option A).

Option C is a result of $(3-5-4) \times 2$, a less common sign error.

Most "proficient" students handle the multiplication correctly but a significant portion will still fail the left-to-right rule for addition/subtraction, making Option D the most attractive distractor.
