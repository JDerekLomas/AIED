This question is a significant "trap" for students across multiple ability levels because it combines two high-frequency error types: the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the multiplication of decimals.

**Analysis of Errors:**
1.  **Option B ($0.27$):** This is the correct answer. Students must square $0.3$ first ($0.09$) and then multiply by $3$.
2.  **Option A ($0.81$):** This is the most common "strong" misconception. Students incorrectly multiply $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ first, then square $0.9$ to get $0.81$. This is a failure of BIDMAS.
3.  **Option D ($2.7$):** Students correctly square $0.3$, but mistakenly believe $0.3^2 = 0.9$. They then calculate $3 \times 0.9 = 2.7$. This is a decimal place-value error ($0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$, not $0.9$).
4.  **Option C ($1.8$):** This typically comes from multiplying $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then doubling (instead of squaring), or $3 \times 0.6$. It represents a lower-level confusion.

Lower-ability students often default to left-to-right calculation (Option A). Mid-range students often remember the order of operations but fail on the specific decimal calculation $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$, leading them to Option D.
