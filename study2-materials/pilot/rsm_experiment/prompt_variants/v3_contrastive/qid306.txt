This question addresses two major aspects of order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS): the hierarchy of operations (multiplication before addition) and the left-to-right rule for operations of equal priority (addition and subtraction).

**Teacher’s Analysis:**
*   **Problem P ($4 - 5 + 6$):** This is a classic trap. Many students believe addition must *always* come before subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS. However, addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be worked left-to-right. Therefore, the first step is $4-5$. Students who incorrectly think "A before S" will choose $5+6$ (Options C or D).
*   **Problem Q ($4 + 5 \times 6$):** Most students recognize that multiplication comes before addition. However, lower-ability students still tend to work purely left-to-right regardless of the operation (Options A or C).

**The "Crux":** The difficulty lies in whether a student realizes that Problem P is "Left-to-Right" while Problem Q is "Hierarchy-based." Option D is a very strong distractor for "Proficient" students who know their BIDMAS acronym but haven't mastered the "equal priority" rule for addition and subtraction.
