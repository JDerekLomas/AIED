As an experienced maths teacher, I identify this as a "traps and conventions" question rather than a simple arithmetic one. 

The inclusion of the number **0** triggers two classic misconceptions:
1.  **Excluding zero (Option C):** Many lower-ability students do not believe 0 "counts" as a data point and will divide by $n-1$.
2.  **Order of Operations (Option B):** This is the "calculator trap." Students often write the mean as a linear string of operations, forgetting that without brackets, BIDMAS/BODMAS dictates that only the 7 is divided by 5.

While Option A is mathematically correct (adding 0 doesn't change the numerator), students often doubt it because the 0 is physically missing from the sum. This leads a surprising number of even "proficient" students to choose "None of them," thinking a formal calculation *must* explicitly show the $+0$.

Here is the predicted distribution:

**below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%**
(At this level, many students follow the "zeros don't count" rule, making C very attractive. B is chosen because it "looks" like how they would type it into a cheap calculator.)

**basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%**
(Students here are starting to realize 0 must be included in the count, but many still fall for the C trap or think the missing +0 in A makes it "incomplete.")

**proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%**
(Most understand the math, but a significant minority will overthink Option A. They see $0+1+3+4+7$ is not *literally* written and will choose "None" (D) out of a sense of pedantry.)

**advanced: A=92% B=2% C=1% D=5%**
(The vast majority see that $1+3+4+7$ is equivalent to $0+1+3+4+7$. The few errors come from over-analysing the notation or rushing and not noticing the BIDMAS error in B.)

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=92% B=02% C=01% D=05%
