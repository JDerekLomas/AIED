This question is a classic test of **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)** combined with fraction arithmetic. 

The primary trap here is the temptation to perform the addition before the multiplication ($1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6$, then $5/6 \times 1/3 = 5/18$). Because the numbers are small and the addition appears first, many lower-ability students will read left-to-right. 

**Option Analysis:**
*   **A ($1/2$):** The correct answer. Calculation: $1/3 + (1/2 \times 1/3) = 1/3 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2$.
*   **B ($5/18$):** The BIDMAS error. $(1/3 + 1/2) \times 1/3 = 5/6 \times 1/3 = 5/18$. This is the most attractive distractor.
*   **C ($2/9$):** Typically results from a "add the tops, multiply the bottoms" confusion or general procedural drift.
*   **D ($1/15$):** Adding all denominators ($3+2+3=8$?) or miscellaneous calculation errors.

Even proficient students occasionally fall for the left-to-right trap if they are rushing, as $1/3 + 1/2$ is a very "standard" fraction addition they are trained to recognise as $5/6$.
