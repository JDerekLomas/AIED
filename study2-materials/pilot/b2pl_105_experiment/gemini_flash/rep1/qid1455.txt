This question tests a student's ability to translate compound worded operations into algebraic notation, specifically focusing on the use of brackets to show order of operations.

The key phrase is "the result". Students must recognise that the addition must happen first. Option A is the classic "left-to-right" reading error where BIDMAS is ignored. Option B is a misinterpretation of the structure (multiplying the number first, then adding). Option C is a confusion between multiplication and powers, which is less common at this level but persists among lower-ability students.

**Predicted Performance:**

**below_basic: A=45% B=25% C=15% D=15%**
Students at this level almost always read left-to-right. Option A looks exactly like the sentence "n + 5 times 4". They rarely consider that brackets are needed to override the standard order of operations.

**basic: A=35% B=25% C=5% D=35%**
These students are beginning to recognise that $4(n+5)$ is a standard algebraic structure, but many will still fall for Option A because it visually mirrors the word order of the question.

**proficient: A=15% B=10% C=2% D=73%**
Proficient students have been trained to look for "the result" or "then" as a trigger for using brackets. While some might still rush and pick A, the majority will identify D as the correct formal representation.

**advanced: A=5% B=3% C=0% D=92%**
Advanced students will immediately identify this as a "forming equations" task. They are familiar with the distributive property and the necessity of brackets when multiplying a sum. The 5% for A accounts for "silly" reading errors under exam pressure.
