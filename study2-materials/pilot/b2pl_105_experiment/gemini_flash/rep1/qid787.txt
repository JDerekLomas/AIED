In this equation ($2v - 5 = 6v - 3$), the candidates are testing two different first steps:
1.  **Jo** tries to isolate the variable terms by moving the constant from the RHS to the LHS: Adding 3 to both sides. $-5 + 3 = -2$. However, Jo has written $-8$ (effectively subtracting 3 from $-5$ instead of adding it).
2.  **Paul** tries to isolate the variable terms by moving the constant from the LHS to the RHS: Adding 5 to both sides. $-3 + 5 = +2$. However, Paul has also written $-8$ (effectively subtracting 5 from $-3$ instead of adding it).

This question is deceptively difficult for students because it involves operations with directed numbers (negatives) combined with algebraic manipulation. A common error in solving linear equations is for students to "see" a minus sign and assume the next step involves adding the numbers together without respect to the negative signs already present ($5+3=8$). 

Because both Jo and Paul arrived at '8', many students will assume at least one of them is right because 5 and 3 often produce 8. Many lower-ability students will choose C because they lack the fluency in directed numbers to see that both have signs the wrong way around.
