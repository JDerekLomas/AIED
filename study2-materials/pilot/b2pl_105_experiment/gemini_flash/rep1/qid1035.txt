This question specifically tests the distribution of a negative sign across a binomial, focusing on the common pitfall of failing to apply the "double negative" to the second term.

While the mathematics is simple, the psychological trap is high for students who see the negative sign outside the bracket as a "toggle" for only the first term rather than an operator for the entire expression. 

*   **Option A** is for students who ignore the negative sign entirely.
*   **Option B** is the most common error: applying the negative to the first term but forgetting to change the sign of the second term (keeping it as $-3p$).
*   **Option C** is a "magic math" error where the student knows signs change but incorrectly flips the leading term to positive.
*   **Option D** is the correct answer.

In the UK classroom, **Option B** is the dominant distractor for "Basic" and "Proficient" students who are moving too quickly.

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=20% C=5% D=70%
advanced: A=1% B=4% C=0% D=95%
