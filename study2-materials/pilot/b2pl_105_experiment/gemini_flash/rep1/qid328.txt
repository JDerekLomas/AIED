As an experienced UK maths teacher, I look at this question as a classic test of adding fractions with unequal denominators, specifically where one denominator is a multiple of the other.

The primary distractor here is **B ($\frac{3}{12}$)**, which represents the "add the numerators and add the denominators" misconception. This is the most common error for students who haven't mastered the concept. Option **C ($\frac{3}{9}$)** is for those who know they need a common denominator but either forget to scale the numerator or simply add the 1 to the 2 and keep the larger denominator. Option **D ($\frac{1}{6}$)** is a random error often seen when students try to apply cross-multiplication or division rules incorrectly.

This specific question is relatively "easy" for the topic because the common denominator is already visible (9), so students don't need to find a new number like 27.
