As an experienced UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as a test of Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) combined with negative number arithmetic.

The difficulty lies in the fact that **Option B** (the correct answer) requires a student to navigate a double negative mid-calculation: $-28 - (-8)$. This is a very common failure point for even proficient students. 
*   **Option A** equals $12$ (many will get $-4 - 16 = -20$ by ignoring the signs or the priority of the subtraction). This is the strongest distractor.
*   **Option C** equals $30$ (some may treat $(-5)^2$ as $-25$, leading them to $-20$).
*   **Option D** equals $22$ (some may forget that a negative divided by a negative is a positive, though $22$ doesn't easily lead to $-20$).

**Analysis:**
- **Below Basic** students often struggle with the multiplication priority and frequently ignore the "minus a minus" rule, often choosing A because the digits look like they could result in 20.
- **Basic** students often get tripped up by the powers in C or the sign in the subtraction of B.
- **Proficient** students usually identify B but often pause or second-guess because $-28 - (-8)$ is counter-intuitive.
- **Advanced** students handle the double negative correctly and quickly eliminate the distractors.

basic: A=35% B=30% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=65% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
