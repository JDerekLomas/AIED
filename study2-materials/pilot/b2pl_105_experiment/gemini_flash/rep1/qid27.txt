This question specifically tests the interaction of substitution with negative numbers and the order of operations. The most significant barrier here is the "double negative" created by subtracting a negative product.

**Analysis of Errors:**
- **The correct path (C):** $10 - 2(-2) = 10 - (-4) = 14$.
- **The "ignore the signs" error (B):** $10 - (2 \times 2) = 6$. This is the most common mistake for students who struggle with directed numbers but understand substitution basics.
- **The "addition/concatenation" error (D):** Treating $10-2$ as $8$, then "placing" the $-2$ or multiplying $8 \times 4$. Alternatively, $10 - 2 \text{ then } d$ as a string. $32$ is also a common guess for those who confuse the sequence of operations or $10 - 2(-2)$ as $(10-2) \times -2 = -16$ (not an option) or other arithmetic slips.
- **The "sign confusion" error (A):** $10 - 4 = 6$, then making it negative, or calculating $-10 - 2 = -12$.
