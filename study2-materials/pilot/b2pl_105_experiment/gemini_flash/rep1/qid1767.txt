This question tests the fundamental understanding of "inverse operations" within the context of solving linear equations. 

The structure of the question is very clean. The transition from $x - 7$ to $x$ is a standard first step in one-step equations. For students, the most common trap in this specific problem is not a misunderstanding of the operation itself, but rather a "visual matching" error where they see the $-7$ and choose the operation $-7$ (Option D) because it looks the same as the equation, or they incorrectly associate the "take away" with more subtraction.

However, because this is the most basic form of algebraic manipulation, even lower-ability students tend to perform relatively well here compared to equations involving coefficients (e.g., $7x = 14$). The absence of negative numbers on the right-hand side (which aren't shown but are implied) prevents additional cognitive load.
