This question is a classic test of directed number arithmetic within an algebraic context. While the algebra itself is a simple one-step equation, the position of the constant on the left-hand side and the involvement of negative numbers create significant friction for lower-ability students.

The primary trap here is Option A ($p=9$). Students see the 3 and the 12 and perform $12 - 3$, ignoring the negative sign on the 3 or incorrectly "moving" the 12 and subtracting it from a positive 3. Option C ($p=-9$) is a common error where students know the answer is negative but essentially calculate $-(12-3)$. Option D ($p=15$) occurs when students mistakenly add 12 to 3 instead of subtracting.

**below_basic:** This group often struggles with the concept of "doing the same to both sides." They are highly likely to see 3 and 12 and try to find a "nice" number like 9 or 15. The negative sign is frequently ignored or misapplied.
**basic:** These students understand they need to subtract 12 from both sides, but the calculation $-3 - 12$ is a high-error zone. Many will arrive at $-9$ by confusedly combining the signs or simply doing $12-3$ and then "making it negative."
**proficient:** Most students here can handle the subtraction of 12 from a negative 3. Some may still make a slip and choose $-9$ if they are rushing, but the majority will correctly identify $-15$.
**advanced:** These students will recognize this as a trivial one-step calculation and are very unlikely to be caught out by the negative numbers.

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=12% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%
