To solve this, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into $10x - 6y = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$, then $10x = 33$, so $x = 3.3$.

**Teacher's Insight:**
This question contains several "friction points" that separate ability levels.
1. **The Coefficient of $y$:** Because it is $-6$, students must handle the negative correctly. A common error is calculating $10x + 3 = 30 \implies 10x = 27 \implies x = 2.7$ (Option D).
2. **Reverse substitution:** Students often mistakenly plug the given value into $x$ instead of $y$. If they plug $0.5$ into $x$, they get $5 - 6y = 30 \implies -6y = 25 \implies y \approx -4.16$. While not an exact match, students seeing $4.25$ or $-4.25$ (Options A/B) often "near-miss" guess these.
3. **Decimal Arithmetic:** $6 \times 0.5$ is usually fine, but the transition from $10x = 33$ to $3.3$ is a high-success step compared to the algebraic manipulation before it.

Option C is the correct answer. Option D is the most attractive distractor for students who make a sign error. Options A and B attract students who struggle with which variable to substitute or who have weak algebraic manipulation skills.
