This question is a classic "order of operations" trap disguised within a fraction-to-decimal conversion task. The numbers are small, but the cognitive load is surprisingly high because the student must handle multiple formats (decimals and fractions) simultaneously while resisting the urge to work from left to right.

**A) 0.2** is the most common distractor for students who ignore the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). They calculate $0.4 - 0.2 = 0.2$, then multiply by 3 to get $0.6$, or they incorrectly subtract the $1/5$ from $0.4$ first.

**B) 0.6** is a secondary "left-to-right" error. These students convert $1/5$ to $0.2$, calculate $0.4 - 0.2 = 0.2$, and then multiply by 3.

**C) -0.2** is the correct answer. The student must recognize that $1/5 \times 3 = 3/5$ (or $0.6$) and then perform $0.4 - 0.6$. The difficulty here is twofold: applying BIDMAS correctly and handling a subtraction that results in a negative number.

**D) 0.06** is a procedural error where students struggle with the placement of the decimal point when multiplying or converting.
