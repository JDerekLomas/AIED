This question tests two distinct skills: the addition of fractions with common denominators and the ability to simplify the resulting fraction. 

The primary "trap" for lower-ability students is the tendency to add both the numerators and the denominators (leading to Option A). For middle-to-high ability students, the challenge lies not in the addition, but in the instruction to "Write your answer in its simplest form." Many students will correctly calculate $\frac{8}{10}$ (Option B) and stop there, either through rushing or forgetting the second step of the process. Option D acts as a distractor for those who might subtract or make a calculation error but still attempt to simplify.

Here is the predicted performance breakdown:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=45% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=25% C=60% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=5% C=92% D=1%
