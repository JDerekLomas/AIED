This question is a classic test of two distinct areas: the understanding of negative bases with even exponents and the common confusion between exponents and multiplication.

The power of 4 is high enough that students who mistakenly calculate $3 \times 4$ or $-3 \times 4$ will see their answers (12 or -12) available as distractors. However, the most significant trap here is the sign. Many students correctly calculate $3^4 = 81$ but reflexively keep the negative sign from the base, resulting in $-81$. This is a persistent error even at the proficient level because of how students often see $-3^4$ evaluated on basic calculators without brackets.

**Below Basic:** These students often treat exponents as multiplication. They are likely to perform $-3 \times 4$ or $3 \times 4$.
**Basic:** These students understand that they need to multiply 3 by itself, but will likely struggle with the sign or make a calculation error (like $3^4 = 27 \times 3 \rightarrow 61$ or similar), eventually settling on a provided distractor. The negative sign is a coin flip for them.
**Proficient:** These students know $3^4 = 81$, but a significant portion will fall for the "negative base stays negative" trap ($k^4 = -3^4 = -81$).
**Advanced:** These students recognise that a negative number raised to an even power results in a positive product.
