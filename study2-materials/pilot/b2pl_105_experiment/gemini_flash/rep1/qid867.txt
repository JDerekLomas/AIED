This question addresses one of the most persistent and "classic" misconceptions in secondary school mathematics: the tendency to square the individual terms within a bracket rather than expanding it as a binomial product.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **The Trap:** Options B and C target the "Freshman's Dream" error, where students assume $(x-4)^2 = x^2 - 4^2$ or $x^2 + (-4)^2$. This is incredibly common among **basic** and **below basic** students who view the squared symbol as an instruction to apply to the visible terms only.
*   **The Sign Error:** Option D targets students who understand that there is a middle term ($2ab$) but struggle with the sign of the constant term $(-4 \times -4)$. Even some **proficient** students occasionally slip up here under pressure.
*   **Difficulty Level:** For a Year 10 or 11 student, this is a "standard" difficulty question, but the presence of the minus sign inside the bracket significantly lowers the success rate compared to $(x+4)^2$.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=25% D=10%
**Reasoning:** At this level, many students do not recognise that $(x-4)^2$ means $(x-4)(x-4)$. They will instinctively square the $x$ and the $4$. B is a very popular "guess" because $4^2$ is 16.

basic: A=45% B=25% C=15% D=15%
**Reasoning:** Students have been introduced to FOIL/Grid method. About half will remember to use it, but the other half will still fall for the shortcut of squaring individual terms.

proficient: A=85% B=5% C=2% D=8%
**Reasoning:** Most students at this level know the expansion produces a trinomial. The main error here is the sign of the constant term (D) or a simple mental arithmetic slip.

advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
**Reasoning:** This is a routine procedure for an advanced student. Errors would be strictly down to rare lapses in concentration.

basic: A=45% B=25% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
