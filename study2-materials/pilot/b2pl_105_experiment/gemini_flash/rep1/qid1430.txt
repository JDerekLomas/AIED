This is one of the most fundamental questions in the fractions curriculum. The primary "trap" for students is Option D ($3/14$), which represents the common misconception of adding both the numerators and the denominators. 

However, because the denominators are the same (common denominators) and the numbers are small and prime, this is considered a very low-demand question. Most "Basic" students have been drilled specifically to "keep the bottom the same" when they match. Option B ($2/49$) would only be chosen by students confusing the operation with multiplication, which is less common when an addition sign is clearly present.

Here is the predicted performance distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=35% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=70% D=20%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=98% D=1%
