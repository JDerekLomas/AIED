This question is a classic test of "sign management" in expanding brackets. The primary difficulty lies in the multiplication of two negative numbers ($-5 \times -7 = +35$). 

**Analysis:**
- **A and D:** These represent a loss of the negative sign on the $m$ term (often due to students thinking the negative outside is "used up" or simply miscopying).
- **B:** This is the most common distractor. Students correctly multiply $5 \times 7$ but follow the sign in the bracket, ignoring the "negative times a negative makes a positive" rule.
- **C:** The correct answer.

In the UK context, "Below Basic" students (roughly GCSE Grade 1-2) often struggle with the basic distributive property or ignore signs entirely. "Basic" students (Grade 3-4) usually distribute the $5$ correctly but are highly prone to the sign error in B. "Proficient" students (Grade 5-6) generally handle one negative but may still make a slip under pressure. "Advanced" students (Grade 7+) rarely miss this.

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=45% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=15% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=4% C=94% D=1%
