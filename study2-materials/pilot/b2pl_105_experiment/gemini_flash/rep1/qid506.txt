As an experienced teacher, I've seen many students encounter equations involving fractions. This specific question is deceptively difficult for lower-attaining students because it triggers two specific instinctive errors.

First, the presence of the number 3 and the 12 in the denominator leads many to "simplify" or divide the 12 by the 3, leading to $\frac{1}{4}$ (Option A). Second, many students have a "common sense" reflex where they feel the answer should be a whole number, leading them to flip the fraction or simply calculate $12 \div 3 = 4$ (Option C).

The correct operation—dividing a fraction by a whole number, or multiplying the denominator by the coefficient—is a common stumbling block. Students often know they need to "divide by 3," but their fractional division skills are weak.

**below_basic:** These students struggle with the reciprocal nature of the operation. Option A is the most "attractive" because $12 \div 3 = 4$. Option C is a very common "panic" answer where they simply ignore the fraction.
**basic:** This group is likely to understand they need to divide by 3, but will perform the operation incorrectly. They frequently divide the denominator by the 3 instead of multiplying it, making Option A the most popular distractor here.
**proficient:** These students generally understand that $p = \frac{1}{12} \div 3$. However, under pressure, some will still perform the calculation as $\frac{1}{12 \div 3}$ rather than $\frac{1}{12 \times 3}$.
**advanced:** These students have a solid grasp of linear equations and fraction arithmetic. They will recognize the need to multiply the denominator and are unlikely to fall for the visual "12 and 3" shortcuts.

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
