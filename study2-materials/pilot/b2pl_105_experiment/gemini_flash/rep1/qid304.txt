This question specifically tests the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). While students often struggle with the calculation of negative numbers ($3-4 = -1$), this question avoids that hurdle by only asking for the *first step*.

The most common error in order of operations is simply reading from left to right (Option A). Option B represents a misunderstanding of how the multiplier interacts with the bracket, while Option D is a common fallback for students who believe math rules are flexible. Because the brackets are explicitly present, many "Basic" students who might normally ignore order of operations will be visually cued to look inside them first.

**below_basic:** A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
**basic:** A=25% B=10% C=60% D=5%
**proficient:** A=10% B=5% C=83% D=2%
**advanced:** A=2% B=1% C=96% D=1%
