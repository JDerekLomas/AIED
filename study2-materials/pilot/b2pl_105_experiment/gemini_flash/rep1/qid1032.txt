This is a classic "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS) question. Despite its simplicity, it is one of the most reliable predictors of mathematical fluency in the UK curriculum. 

The primary trap is the "left-to-right" error ($5+4=9$, then $9 \times 3 = 27$), which leads students to option A. Option C represents a double error where the student adds all numbers and then multiplies (or simply guesses a larger number), while option D is often a result of adding all components ($5+4+3$).

At the **below_basic** level, the cognitive tendency is to read the expression like a sentence, leading to a high percentage choosing A. At the **basic** level (typically GCSE Foundation students), many know the acronym BIDMAS but fail to apply it when the addition comes first. By **proficient**, students have internalized that multiplication takes precedence. **Advanced** students see this as a trivial "check" question.

below_basic: A=65% B=15% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=45% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=15% B=82% C=1% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=98% C=0% D=0%
