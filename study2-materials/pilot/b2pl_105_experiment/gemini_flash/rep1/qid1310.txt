As a UK maths teacher, here is my analysis of this question:

The primary challenge here isn't the presence of decimals, but rather the "nested" structure of the brackets. Students are taught **BIDMAS/BODMAS**, and most know that "Brackets come first." However, "Below Basic" students often default to reading left-to-right despite the rules, leading them to pick the first operation they see inside the outer bracket (Division).

"Proficient" students generally understand that you work from the innermost bracket outwards. The inclusion of $0.4 - 0.3$ as an option (Option C) is a "visual adjacency" trap for students who ignore the bracket boundaries and simply look for operations that look easy to perform. Option D is a trap for students who think the final operation in the string is somehow the priority or who confuse the order of operations.

This specific question is relatively straightforward because the inner bracket $(0.2 + 0.4)$ is very clearly defined, making it an "easy" application of nested BIDMAS for anyone with a basic grasp of the concept.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=1% D=0%
