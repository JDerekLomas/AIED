As an experienced UK maths teacher, I’ve analyzed this specific question. It tests the addition of mixed numbers with different denominators. 

The primary "trap" is Option D, which represents the most common error in fraction addition: adding the numerators and adding the denominators ($7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$). Option A is the correct numerical value but fails the instruction to "Leave your answer as a mixed number," a requirement that catches out even high-ability students who follow a method of converting to improper fractions first. Option C is a common mistake where students find a common denominator by multiplying but fail to adjust the numerators correctly, or simply multiply denominators while adding numerators.

Here is the predicted performance breakdown:

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=25% D=45%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
