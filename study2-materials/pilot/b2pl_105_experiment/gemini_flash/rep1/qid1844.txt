As a UK maths teacher, here is my analysis of this question.

This is a classic "interchangeable parts" question for quadratic graphs. While students are often drilled on finding the $x$-intercepts (roots), they frequently mix up the procedures when asked for the $y$-intercept.

**The Traps:**
1.  **Option B** is the "Root Trap." Many students see $(x-8)(x-6)$ and immediately think $x=8$ and $x=6$. Because they don't read the question carefully ("$y$-axis"), they choose the roots but express them as coordinates on the $y$-axis.
2.  **Option A** is the "Addition Trap." Students know they need to do something with $-8$ and $-6$, and they incorrectly sum them rather than multiplying them.
3.  **Option D** is the "Sign Trap." Students multiply $8 \times 6$ but get confused by the negative signs, often thinking that because there are minus signs in the brackets, the result must be negative.

**Student Performance Predictions:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often guess or perform a simple operation. Many will choose A (adding the numbers) or B (just taking the numbers from the brackets).
*   **Basic:** Students at this level know the $y$-intercept involves the "end" number, but they often struggle with directed numbers. D is a very common mistake here because they see the minus signs and assume a negative intercept.
*   **Proficient:** These students know to substitute $x=0$ and calculate $(-8) \times (-6) = 48$. They are likely to get this right, though some will still fall for the "Root Trap" (B) if they rush.
*   **Advanced:** Almost all will get this correct. They have internalized that the $y$-intercept is the constant term when expanded ($c$ in $ax^2 + bx + c$).

below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=25% C=30% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%
