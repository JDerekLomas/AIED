To predict the performance on this question, we must look at how students handle the "negative" vs "fractional" base when squaring. 

The theory being tested is whether $2n^2 - 1$ is always positive. A counter-example must result in a value $\le 0$.
*   **A:** $2(9/16) - 1 = 18/16 - 1 = 0.125$ (Positive, not a counter-example)
*   **B:** $2(0.25) - 1 = 0.5 - 1 = -0.5$ (**Negative, correct counter-example**)
*   **C:** $2(4) - 1 = 7$ (Positive, not a counter-example)
*   **D:** $2(1) - 1 = 1$ (Positive, not a counter-example)

The primary "trap" is the treatment of negatives. Many students at basic levels believe that negative numbers "make things negative." They will gravitate toward C and D because they see the minus signs, but they often forget that $(-n)^2$ becomes positive. Option B is difficult because it requires squaring a decimal (which gets smaller) to produce a result where $2n^2 < 1$.

**below_basic:** Students in this category often guess based on the "look" of the numbers. Many will pick C or D simply because they see negative numbers and assume the result must be negative.
**basic:** These students know they need to calculate, but they often make the classic error with D: $2 \times -1^2 - 1 = -2 - 1 = -3$. They apply the negative after the squaring or incorrectly interpret the brackets.
**proficient:** These students generally handle negative squares correctly but may struggle to evaluate $2(0.5)^2$ or $2(3/4)^2$ quickly. They are likely to correctly identify B after checking the others.
**advanced:** These students will identify that for the result to be negative, $n^2$ must be less than $0.5$. They will instantly see that $0.5^2 = 0.25$, making B the obvious choice.

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=15% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
