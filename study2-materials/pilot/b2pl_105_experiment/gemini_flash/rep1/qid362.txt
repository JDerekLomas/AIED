This question is a classic "gradient of an implicit line" problem. It tests two distinct skills: the ability to rearrange an equation into the form $y = mx + c$, and the ability to handle negative signs during that manipulation.

The most common error for **Below Basic** and **Basic** students is identifying the coefficient of $x$ as the gradient without rearranging (Option B), or simply changing the sign of the coefficient (Option A). **Proficient** students often remember they need to divide by the coefficient of $y$, but a significant portion will lose the negative sign when moving the $4x$ to the right-hand side, leading them to Option D. **Advanced** students usually perform the two-step rearrangement ($3y = -4x + 5 \Rightarrow y = -\frac{4}{3}x + \frac{5}{3}$) mentally with high accuracy.

The specific numbers here ($4$ and $3$) are difficult because $\frac{4}{3}$ is a "messy" fraction, which often makes lower-ability students doubt their calculation and revert to the whole numbers 4 or -4.

below_basic: A=25% B=45% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=25% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=50% D=30%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=85% D=10%
