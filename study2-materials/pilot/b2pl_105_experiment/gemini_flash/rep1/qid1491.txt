This question is a classic "sign vs. magnitude" trap. While the calculation $2^4 = 16$ is relatively straightforward for mid-to-high ability students, the interaction between the negative base and the even exponent is where the primary error occurs.

The presence of the brackets is the crucial discriminator here. Students at the "below basic" level often ignore the exponent rules and treat it as $-2 \times 4$ (leading to -8). Students at the "basic" and "proficient" levels often remember that $(-2)^2$ is positive, but the larger exponent ($4$) increases the cognitive load, leading many to default to the common misconception that a leading negative sign *always* results in a negative answer, regardless of the brackets. Many students will also be confused by how their specific calculator handles $-2^4$ vs $(-2)^4$, leading to a high percentage of "A" selections even among those who understand indices.

**below_basic:** A=30% B=45% C=10% D=15%
**basic:** A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%
**proficient:** A=25% B=5% C=68% D=2%
**advanced:** A=5% B=0% C=95% D=0%
