This question is a classic test of "order of operations" in reverse when solving linear equations. 

**Tom's method** is the conventional first step (adding 5 to both sides). Most students find this intuitive because the $-5$ is "loosely" attached to the fraction. 
**Katie's method** is the "trap" that reveals a deep conceptual misunderstanding of the distributive property. To multiply by 3 as a first step, she must multiply *every* term by 3, resulting in $x - 15 = 36$. Her mistake ($x - 5 = 36$) is one of the most common errors seen at GCSE; students often remember they need to multiply the other side of the equals sign, but forget to multiply the "loose" constant on the left.

**The difficulty:**
- **Below Basic/Basic** students often see any algebraic manipulation that "moves" a number and changes its sign or performs an inverse as potentially valid. They often think Katie is correct because "she multiplied the 12 and the 3."
- **Proficient** students usually recognise Tom is right but often get lured into thinking Katie is also correct because they don't look closely enough at the $-5$, assuming that multiplying by the denominator "gets rid of it" everywhere.
- **Advanced** students will spot that Katie failed to multiply the constant term by 3.
