This question is a subtle test of the **Commutative Property** and its interaction with the **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)**.

Many students are taught the "Left to Right" rule for addition and subtraction. Tom’s statement ($3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$) is correct, but a common misconception exists where students believe you *must* do the addition before the subtraction ($3+2-1 = 4$ vs $3-(1+2)=0$). However, because Tom keeps the negative sign with the 1, his statement is mathematically sound.

Katie’s statement is a simple application of the commutative property of addition ($a + b = b + a$), where $b$ is the product $(2 \times 1)$. Since both sides equal 5, she is also correct. 

The primary "trap" here is students overthinking BIDMAS and believing that changing the order of terms automatically violates the hierarchy, even when the underlying arithmetic remains identical.
