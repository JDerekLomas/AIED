As an experienced teacher, I’ve found that the "Product of Negative Numbers" is one of the most persistent hurdles in Key Stage 3 and early GCSE. 

The main difficulty in this specific question is not the arithmetic (3 × 8 and 4 × 6 are both very familiar), but the conflict between **integer signs** and **sum vs. product**.

*   **Option A** is the "classic" mistake. Students know $3 \times 8 = 24$, and seeing two negative signs makes them think "it must be negative" because the numbers themselves are negative, rather than applying the rule that a negative times a negative is a positive.
*   **Option C** catches the "Below Basic" group who confuse "product" with "sum." $-10 + -14 = -24$. 
*   **Option D** is a distractor for those who have a shaky grasp of multiplication facts or think $-3 + 9$ is 6 and then somehow reach 24 through a "common wrong number" association.

Here is my prediction for the performance distribution:

below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=45% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=15% B=82% C=2% D=1%
advanced: A=2% B=98% C=0% D=0%
