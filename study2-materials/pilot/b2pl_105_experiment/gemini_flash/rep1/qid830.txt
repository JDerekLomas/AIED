This question tests a student's ability to substitute a decimal into a linear equation and solve for the other variable. 

What makes this specific question tricky for students is the "hidden" subtraction and division involving decimals.
*   **The common error (Option B):** Many students substitute $x=0.3$ to get $0.6 + 3y = 12$. They then correctly subtract $0.6$ from $12$. However, a very common decimal subtraction error is $12 - 0.6 = 11.7$ or thinking that because $12 - 6 = 6$, then $12 - 0.6$ must end in a $.4$ or $.9$ via flawed mental carry-overs. More specifically, many students get to $3y = 11.4$. They then divide $11.4$ by $3$. $11.4 \div 3 = 3.8$. 
*   **Option D (The correct answer):** Requires two steps of precision: $2(0.3) = 0.6$, then $12 - 0.6 = 11.4$, then $11.4 \div 3 = 3.8$.
*   **The trap (Option C):** Students often confuse the coefficients. If they mistakenly use $y=0.3$ and solve for $x$, they get $2x + 0.9 = 12 \rightarrow 2x = 11.1 \rightarrow x = 5.55$ (not listed). If they divide $12.6$ (adding $0.6$ instead of subtracting) by $3$, they get $4.2$.
*   **Option A:** Is a "guessing" result for students who see $x=0.3$ and $y=4$ (if $x=0$) and try to subtract $0.3$ or similar logic.

Real-world performance on this is lower than one might expect because of the decimal arithmetic in the middle of an algebra problem.
