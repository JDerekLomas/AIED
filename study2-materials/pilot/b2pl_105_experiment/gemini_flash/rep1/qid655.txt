This question is significantly more challenging than standard integer multiplication or basic fraction arithmetic because it involves the intersection of two high-error areas: directed numbers (signs) and fractions where the quotient is not an integer.

Most students are comfortable with $(-6) \times \text{something} = -12$ or $(-6) \times \text{something} = 6$. However, when the product ($8$) is larger than the factor ($6$), but not a multiple of it, students frequently "flip" the division, calculating $8 \div 6$ instead of $6 \div 8$, or vice versa.

**Key difficulties:**
1.  **The Sign:** Students often correctly identify that "negative $\times$ positive = negative," leading them to seek a positive answer. This eliminates B and C.
2.  **The Fraction Structure:** The equation $(-6)x = -8$ requires $x = \frac{-8}{-6}$. A very common misconception is that the "bigger number goes on top" or that because we are "starting" with 6, it should be the numerator.
3.  **Advanced insight:** Even proficient students often default to $6/8$ because they intuitively feel that a fraction "less than 1" must be the answer when they see the numbers 6 and 8, failing to realise that multiplying 6 by a number greater than 1 is the only way to reach 8.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=25% D=20%
*(Low-ability students often guess or pick numbers in the order they appear in the question. B and C are attractive because they see a negative result and assume a negative factor is needed.)*

basic: A=45% B=15% C=15% D=25%
*(Students at this level often correctly identify that the missing number must be positive. However, they almost universally default to the "bigger number on the bottom" for fractions, making A the most common trap.)*

proficient: A=30% B=5% C=10% D=55%
*(Proficient students understand the sign rules well. The battle here is purely between the two positive fractions. Many will still instinctively pick $6/8$ without performing the algebraic step of dividing -8 by -6.)*

advanced: A=10% B=2% C=3% D=85%
*(High-ability students will quickly rearrange the equation to $\frac{-8}{-6}$ and simplify the signs. A small percentage may still make a "reflex" error choosing $6/8$.)*
