As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen this double inequality trip many students up, though it is a standard GCSE higher-tier (or high-attaining Foundation) question. 

The primary hurdle here isn't the algebra itself, but the management of two operations on two different sides simultaneously.
*   **The Trap for "Basic" students:** Many will only apply the operations to the right-hand side of the inequality ($2x+1 < 5 \Rightarrow x < 2$) and ignore or guess the left. 
*   **The common calculation error:** When subtracting 1 from $-5$, students frequently get $-4$ instead of $-6$, leading to Option C.
*   **Distractor A:** This comes from the "inverse operation" confusion where students add 1 instead of subtracting it ($5+1=6 \times 2 = 12$; $-5+1 = -4 \times 2 = -8$), though it is less common at this level.
*   **Distractor D:** Students who divide by 2 first but forget to divide the 1, or simply lose track of the order of operations.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=35% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=45% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=96% C=4% D=0%
