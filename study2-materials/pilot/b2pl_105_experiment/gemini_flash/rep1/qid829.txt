This quadratic expansion question targets two specific areas where UK students often falter: the addition of two negative directed numbers (for the linear term) and the multiplication of two negative directed numbers (for the constant term).

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **A (Correct):** Students need to correctly identify $-3 - 2 = -5$ and $(-3) \times (-2) = +6$.
*   **B ($m^2-m-6$):** This attracts students who mix up the operations, perhaps doing $-3 + 2$ or thinking of the difference between 3 and 2, while also making a sign error on the constant.
*   **C ($m^2+5m+6$):** A common error for students who ignore the signs inside the brackets entirely, or who think "two minuses make a plus" applies to the addition part ($-3-2$).
*   **D ($m^2-5m-6$):** This is the most common "proficient" error. Students correctly sum to $-5$ but succumb to the very common mistake that "a negative and a negative make a negative" when multiplying (incorrectly concluding $-3 \times -2 = -6$).

**Performance Prediction:**
Below Basic students often guess or pick options that simply reuse the numbers 3 and 2 without much grasp of the FOIL/Grid method. Basic students struggle heavily with directed numbers. Proficient students usually handle the $m^2$ and $5m$ correctly but are highly susceptible to the sign error on the constant $(-3 \times -2)$. Advanced students rarely miss the sign on the constant.
