In my experience teaching expansion of brackets, this specific question is a "classic" trap because it targets the intersection of three potential errors: the operation (multiplying vs. adding), the sign rule (negative times negative), and the basic multiplication fact.

The fact that students are specifically asked for the "multiplied" result of -4 and -3 often triggers an additive response in lower-ability students, as they see the two negative signs and think "minus 4 minus 3". "Proficient" students usually know it’s multiplication but are the most prone to the "minus times minus equals minus" sign error if they are rushing. "Advanced" students almost never miss the double negative in this isolated context.

The most common wrong answer across the board is B (-12), because many students correctly identify 12 but feel that "negative things should result in a negative." A and D are chosen by those who add rather than multiply.

below_basic: A=15% B=40% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=45% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=25% C=65% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=4% C=94% D=1%
