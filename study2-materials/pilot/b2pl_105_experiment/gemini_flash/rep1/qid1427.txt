As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as a test of one of the most fundamental concepts in algebra: inverse operations for solving linear equations.

The transition from $x + 7$ to $x$ is the prototypical first step in solving a one-step equation. For students at the 'below basic' level, the most common error is "number matching" or "operator copying," where they see a plus sign in the equation and choose a plus sign for the operation. Some may also get confused by the visual layout, but because this is the simplest form of inverse operations, the success rate is generally high.

The "traps" are minimal here; the numbers are small and there are no negative signs to complicate the logic. 'Basic' students almost always identify that to "get rid" of a $+7$ they must do the opposite. 'Proficient' and 'Advanced' students will find this trivial.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown:

below_basic: A=18% B=5% C=2% D=75%
basic: A=8% B=2% C=0% D=90%
proficient: A=2% B=1% C=0% D=97%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
