This question tests a student's ability to substitute a known value into a linear equation and solve for a variable, specifically handling negative numbers and basic two-step rearrangement.

While the context mentions "simultaneous equations," the actual task is simple substitution: $2j - 8 = -10$.

The primary "trap" here is the negative arithmetic. To solve for $j$, students must add $8$ to $-10$.
- Students who incorrectly calculate $-10 + 8 = 18$ (ignoring signs) will get $2j = 18 \rightarrow j = 9$ (**Option B**).
- Students who calculate $-10 + 8 = -18$ (misapplying sign rules) will get $2j = -18 \rightarrow j = -9$ (**Option C**).
- Students who perform the inverse operation incorrectly (subtracting 8 instead of adding) will get $2j = -18 \rightarrow j = -9$ (**Option C**).
- **Option A** ($j=1$) is a distractor for those who might lose the negative sign on the 10 and calculate $10 - 8 = 2 \rightarrow 2j = 2$.

**Teacher's Insight:** Most "Proficient" students handle the substitution well but "Below Basic" and "Basic" students frequently stumble when a negative constant is on the right-hand side, often reverting to absolute values or incorrect inverse operations.

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=45% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=35% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=15% D=75%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=3% D=95%
