This question tests two specific skills: knowledge of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and an understanding of the commutative property (specifically that subtraction is not commutative).

The inclusion of decimals (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) is a "distractor" designed to increase the perceived cognitive load, but they are irrelevant to the underlying logic. 

**Student Performance Analysis:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often follow "left-to-right" logic regardless of operators. They may see Katie's answer as a valid rearrangement because they struggle with the significance of the minus sign being attached to the $0.2 \div 0.3$ term. Many will guess C because "both look like ways to write it."
*   **Basic:** Students at this level usually know BIDMAS ("Divide before Subtract"). They will recognize Tom is correct. However, a significant portion will still choose C, mistakenly believing that in math, you can often "swap things around" (misapplying commutativity from addition/multiplication).
*   **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of BIDMAS. They see that Tom has simply added redundant brackets that clarify the standard order of operations. They recognize that Katie has reversed the subtraction, which changes the result.
*   **Advanced:** These students will identify the correct answer almost instantly. They might spend a second wondering if there is a "trap" involving the recurring decimal of $0.2 \div 0.3$, but will quickly conclude the order of operations remains the priority.
