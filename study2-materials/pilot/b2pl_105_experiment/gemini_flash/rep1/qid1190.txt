This equation tests two main skills: algebraic manipulation (isolating $p$) and directed number arithmetic (specifically $-5 - 10$). 

The most common error in this specific question arises from "number bond" instinct. Students see 5 and 10 and instinctively want to reach for 5 or 15. The negative sign on the left-hand side is the primary hurdle. 

**Option A ($p=5$)** is a common "difference" trap where students subtract 5 from 10, ignoring the negative sign on the 5. 
**Option B ($p=-5$)** is usually a guess or a misunderstanding of how to balance the equation (thinking the answer must be one of the numbers already present).
**Option C (Correct)** requires the student to subtract 10 from both sides: $-5 - 10 = -15$.
**Option D ($p=15$)** results from ignoring the negative sign on the 5 and simply adding it to 10, or moving the 10 across and mistakenly adding it.

The "Below Basic" group often struggles with the concept of a negative resulting in a "more negative" number when subtracting, leading to a high percentage choosing A or D.

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=55% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=88% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=0% C=98% D=1%
