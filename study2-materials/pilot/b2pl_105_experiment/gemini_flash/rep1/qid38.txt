As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question on algebraic fractions.

**Analysis of the Question:**
This question tests the ability to find a common denominator. The "trap" here is that one denominator ($2x$) is a multiple of the other ($x$). 
*   **The Correct Path (A):** Multiply $\frac{4}{x}$ by $\frac{2}{2}$ to get $\frac{8}{2x}$, then add: $\frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.
*   **The "Add Across" Error (B):** Adding numerators ($3+4=7$) and adding denominators ($2x+x=3x$). This is the most common error for low-ability students.
*   **The "Missing Factor" Error (D):** Students recognize the common denominator is $2x$, but they forget to multiply the numerator of the second fraction by 2. They just add the numerators: $\frac{3+4}{2x} = \frac{7}{2x}$.
*   **The "Double it all" Error (C):** Students might try to make the denominator $x$ by halving the first fraction (getting 1.5) or over-compensating. $11/x$ usually comes from incorrectly scaling the first fraction or a logic error in clearing the 2.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=75% B=5% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%

**Rationale:**
- **Below Basic:** These students almost always add across (Option B) or simply guess between adding the numerators over the larger denominator (Option D).
- **Basic:** Students at this level know they need a common denominator, but a very high percentage forget to adjust the numerator accordingly, making Option D a very strong "distractor" for this specific cohort.
- **Proficient:** GCSE students targeting Grades 5/6 generally handle this well, though careless errors in scaling ($4 \times 2$ being written as $4$ or $6$) still occur.
- **Advanced:** These students (Grades 7-9) find this straightforward and will likely spot the trap immediately.
