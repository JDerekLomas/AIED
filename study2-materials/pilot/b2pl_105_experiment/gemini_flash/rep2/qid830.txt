This question is significantly more difficult than a standard "find the missing value" table question because it involves decimals and an implicit equation form. 

Most students will correctly substitute $x = 0.3$ into the equation to get $0.6 + 3y = 12$, then subtract $0.6$ to get $3y = 11.4$. The main point of failure is the division of $11.4$ by $3$. 

**Option B (3.9)** is the strongest distractor; students often mistakenly think $12 - 0.3 = 11.7$ and $11.7 \div 3 = 3.9$, or they simply make a subtraction error from 12. 
**Option A (4.1)** is chosen by students who see the ".3" in the question and assume the answer must end in ".1" to balance to a whole number, or who perform $12.3 \div 3$ by mistake.
**Option C (4.2)** is a "near-miss" calculation error.

Lower ability students struggle with the decimal arithmetic and the two-step rearrangement required before they even get to the division.
