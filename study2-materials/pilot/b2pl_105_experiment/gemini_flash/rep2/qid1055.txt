To predict the performance on this question, we must look at the specific fractions provided: $\frac{3}{5}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$. Adding these requires finding a common denominator (20).

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **D ($\frac{17}{20}$):** The correct answer ($\frac{12}{20} + \frac{5}{20}$).
*   **A ($\frac{4}{9}$):** The most common misconception in fraction addition—adding the numerators ($3+1$) and adding the denominators ($5+4$).
*   **B ($\frac{4}{20}$):** A "hybrid" error where the student correctly identifies the common denominator but either multiplies the numerators incorrectly or simply adds the original numerators ($3+1$).
*   **C ($\frac{7}{20}$):** Often chosen by students who try to cross-multiply but perform a subtraction or an incorrect addition of the numerators ($3+4$).

**Student Behavior:**
Low-ability students almost reflexively choose A. This is one of the most persistent errors in secondary mathematics. Mid-level students (basic/proficient) know they need a common denominator but often make a computational slip when converting the numerators (forgetting to multiply the 3 by 4). Advanced students will find this trivial as the numbers are small and the common denominator is the product of the two denominators.
