To provide an accurate prediction, let’s evaluate the calculations and the likely student thought processes for this Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and directed numbers question.

**The calculations:**
*   **A:** $2 \times (-2) - (-4) \times 4 = -4 - (-16) = -4 + 16 = \mathbf{12}$
*   **B:** $-28 - (-4) \times 2 = -28 - (-8) = -28 + 8 = \mathbf{-20}$ **(Correct)**
*   **C:** $(-5)^2 + 5 = 25 + 5 = \mathbf{30}$
*   **D:** $(-42) \div (-2) + 1 = 21 + 1 = \mathbf{22}$

**Teacher’s Analysis:**
This question is deceptively difficult because of the density of negative signs. 
1.  **Option B (The Answer):** Requires the student to multiply before subtracting. A very common error here is calculating left-to-right: $-28 - (-4) = -24$, then $-24 \times 2 = -48$. Alternatively, many students struggle with $-28 + 8$, incorrectly arriving at $-36$ or $+20$.
2.  **Option C:** A huge "trap" for lower-ability students. Many believe $(-5)^2$ is $-25$. If they think this, they get $-25 + 5 = -20$. This makes Option C the strongest distractor for "Basic" students.
3.  **Option D:** Many students think a "negative divided by a negative is a negative," leading them to $-21 + 1 = -20$.
4.  **Option A:** Involves multiple steps that allow for sign errors in the middle, but is less likely to be chosen as a "guess" compared to C or D.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=40% D=25%
*(Notes: High reliance on Option C due to the $(-5)^2 = -25$ misconception and Option D due to division sign confusion.)*

basic: A=10% B=35% C=30% D=25%
*(Notes: Students start to apply BIDMAS but often fail the final addition of directed numbers in Option B, or still fall for the squaring-negatives trap in C.)*

proficient: A=5% B=65% C=15% D=15%
*(Notes: Most can handle the multiplication before subtraction, but some still make "quick" sign errors under pressure.)*

advanced: A=2% B=92% C=3% D=3%
*(Notes: High mastery of BIDMAS and directed numbers. Errors are usually down to simple arithmetic slips rather than conceptual misunderstandings.)*
