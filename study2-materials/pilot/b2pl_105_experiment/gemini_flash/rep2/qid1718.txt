This is one of the most "classic" diagnostic questions in GCSE Mathematics. It tests a fundamental misconception in algebra: the belief that $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - b^2$ or $a^2 + b^2$ (distributing the power over a subtraction), alongside the ability to correctly manage signs when squaring a negative number.

**Key Insights:**
*   **The "Freshman's Dream":** Options B and C are extremely high-frequency errors for students at the basic and below-basic levels. Students simply square the $x$ and square the $3$ without recognizing that the squared bracket implies $(x-3)(x-3)$.
*   **The Sign Error:** For those who know they need to expand the double brackets, the choice between A and D tests the "negative times a negative" rule. Many proficient students still struggle with $-3 \times -3 = +9$.
*   **Discrimination:** This question is a very effective filter. Advanced students will get it right almost 100% of the time, while proficient students may still fall for the sign trap (Option A). Basic and below-basic students are heavily drawn to the "shortcut" of Option B.

Here is the predicted distribution of responses:

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=0% D=97%
