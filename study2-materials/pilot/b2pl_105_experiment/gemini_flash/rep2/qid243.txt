As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this question by looking at the two main "danger zones" for students: the manipulation of negative numbers and the handling of the inequality sign when variables appear on both sides.

The most common successful path for students is to subtract $3n$ from both sides to keep the $n$ term positive ($2 \geq n - 5$), then add $5$ to get $7 \geq n$. 

However, many "basic" and "below basic" students are conditioned to move terms to the left. If they do $3n - 4n \geq -5 - 2$, they reach $-n \geq -7$. The most common error here is to simply drop the negatives without flipping the sign (leading to $n \geq -7$ or variations resulting in choice D) or to fail to handle the $-5 - 2$ correctly. Choice B comes from the common "difference" error where students subtract $3-2$ and $5-4$. Choice A is a result of sign errors during the transposition of the constant terms (e.g., $2 - 5$).

The distinction between C and D is the primary separator between "proficient" and "basic" students.

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=35% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=75% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
