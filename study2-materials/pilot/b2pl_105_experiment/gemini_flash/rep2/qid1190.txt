This question is a classic "sign error" trap that leverages the cognitive load of having the variable on the right-hand side and starting with a negative constant.

Many students at the **below_basic** level see the numbers 5 and 10 and perform a simple subtraction ($10 - 5$), leading them to choose A or B based on where they think the minus sign should go. The **basic** group often identifies that they need to subtract 10 from both sides, but they struggle with the directed number calculation $-5 - 10$. A common error here is "finding the difference" between 5 and 10, leading to $p=5$ (Option A).

The **proficient** group generally handles the algebra correctly but is still susceptible to the "two negatives make a positive" interference, mistakenly calculating $-5 - 10 = -5$ or $5$. The **advanced** group will almost all correctly compute $-5 - 10 = -15$.

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%
