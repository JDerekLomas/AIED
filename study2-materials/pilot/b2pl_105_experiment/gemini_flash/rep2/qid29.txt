This question tests the ability to solve a linear inequality where the variable appears on both sides. Unlike many inequality questions, it does not require multiplying or dividing by a negative number (provided the student moves the $2n$ to the right), which avoids the "flip the sign" trap. However, the positioning of the variable on the right-hand side in the final steps creates a significant directional confusion for students.

The most common error is a calculation mistake in the constant terms ($3 + 7 = 10$ vs $3 - 7 = -4$ or similar) and then misinterpreting the direction of the inequality symbol when the variable is on the right ($10 \leq n$ is the same as $n \geq 10$).

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **B (Correct):** $10 \leq n$. Obtained by $3 + 7 \leq 3n - 2n$.
*   **C (Common Misconception):** $n \leq 10$. Students solve it correctly to $10 \leq n$ but automatically write the $n$ on the left and keep the symbol pointing the same way. This is a very high-frequency error in UK classrooms (KS3 and Foundation GCSE).
*   **A:** $2 \leq n$. A common arithmetic error where students divide $10$ by the $5$ they think they see, or mismanage the $3$ and $7$.
*   **D:** $-4 \leq n$. Results from $3 - 7$ instead of $3 + 7$.
