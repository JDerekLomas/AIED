This question tests the fundamental concept of inverse operations within the context of formal equation solving. It specifically evaluates whether students understand that to "isolate" $x$ from $+7$, the inverse operation of subtraction must be applied.

The layout reflects standard UK classroom practice (showing operations on arrows), which makes the question accessible. However, students at the "below basic" level often struggle with the direction of the operation—some believe that because they see a $+7$, they should write $+7$ to "label" the term they are dealing with, or they may pick a random operation. The most common error across all levels is the "sign change" confusion, though this is a very straightforward example where the visual of $x+7$ becoming $x$ is a strong hint.

**below_basic:** A=25% B=10% C=5% D=60%
**basic:** A=12% B=3% C=2% D=83%
**proficient:** A=5% B=1% C=1% D=93%
**advanced:** A=1% B=0% C=0% D=99%
