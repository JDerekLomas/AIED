In this question, students must navigate the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). The calculation without brackets results in $12$ ($16 - 6 + 2$). 

The most significant distractor is **Option A**. Students with a surface-level understanding of BIDMAS often believe that Addition *must* come before Subtraction (since 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym). These students will calculate $6+4=10$, then $10 \div 2 = 5$, and finally $16-5=11$. However, those who struggle even further with order might do $16-10=6$ then $6 \div 2 = 3$, or they may simply see the brackets in Option A and assume that is where the "work" needs to be done to change the original answer.

**Option D** is the correct answer $(14 \div 2 = 7)$. It is relatively accessible because it involves a simple division by 2 at the end, which many students will gravitate towards when looking for a result of 7. **Option B** and **C** both result in 12, the same as the original expression, and are usually ignored by students who realize brackets need to "change" something.
