This is one of the most fundamental questions in the secondary maths curriculum, testing the basic concept of adding fractions with common denominators. Because the denominators are identical and the sum of the numerators is small and does not require simplification, this question has a very high success rate.

The primary distractor is **D**, representing the "add across" misconception (adding both numerators and denominators). This is the most common error in fractional arithmetic. Distractor **B** targets a similar error where students multiply the denominators while adding the numerators (common when confused with multiplication rules). Distractor **A** is a simple processing error.

Because the question is so standard and involves prime denominators (7), it is unlikely that even lower-ability students will be tricked into finding a "lowest common multiple" that doesn't already exist.
