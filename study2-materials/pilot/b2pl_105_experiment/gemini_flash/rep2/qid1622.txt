In this question, students are required to substitute $x=0$ into the linear equation $3x + 2y = 6$. While this is a foundational skill, several factors influence student performance here.

The "easy" part of this question is that $x=0$ simplifies the expression significantly ($3 \times 0 = 0$). However, common errors involve:
1. **Coefficient confusion:** Students see the $3$ in $3x$ and the $2$ in $2y$ and perform $6 \div 3 = 2$ (Option B) instead of $6 \div 2 = 3$ (Option A). This is the most common error because the $3$ is the first number they see.
2. **Operations errors:** Lower-ability students may add the coefficients ($3+2+6$) or multiply them all to get values like 12 (Option D).
3. **Linear sequence logic:** Some students may look for "half of 3" (Option C) if they try to find a midpoint, though this is less common for this specific layout.

The high-ability (advanced) students will find this trivial. Proficient students will likely get it right but some might slip and divide by the wrong coefficient. Below-basic students often struggle with the algebraic notation of $2y=6$ and may guess or pick the number associated with the $x$ term.
