This question is a classic test of a student's ability to distinguish between $20 \div 5$ and $5 \div 20$. In my experience, the most common error in simple linear equations like $ax = b$ is the "large divided by small" habit, where students instinctively divide the larger number by the smaller one regardless of their positions.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A (Correct):** Adding 5 and dividing by 20 gives $5/20$, which simplifies to $1/4$.
- **B (Common Error):** This is the "big $\div$ small" error ($20/5 = 4$). It is the most common attractor for students who can't handle fractions as answers.
- **C & D (Sign Errors):** These capture students who struggle with the inverse operation (subtracting 5 instead of adding) or who perform the division correctly but apply a negative sign randomly.

The "Below Basic" group will almost exclusively pick **B** because they often believe that a division resulting in a proper fraction is "wrong" or "impossible" in the context of a simple equation. "Proficient" students generally avoid the division error but might still make a hasty sign error.

below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
