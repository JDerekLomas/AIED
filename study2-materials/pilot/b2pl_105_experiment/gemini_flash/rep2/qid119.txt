In this question, students must interpret a visual representation of directed numbers. The diagram shows a large vector of $-24$ and a smaller vector that is clearly one-third of the length pointing in the same direction.

The core difficulty here is the application of the "rules" of multiplying and dividing negatives versus the logic of the diagram. 
1. **Tom's calculation:** $-3 \times (-8)$ equals $+24$. This contradicts his own written answer of $-24$ and the basic rules of arithmetic (negative $\times$ negative = positive).
2. **Katie's calculation:** $(-24) \div -3$ equals $+8$. This also contradicts her written answer of $-8$.

While the diagram shows that three lots of $-8$ make $-24$ (which would be $3 \times -8 = -24$ or $-24 \div 3 = -8$), neither Tom nor Katie has written a mathematically correct equation. Students at lower ability levels often struggle with "sign rules" and may see "3", "8", and "24" and assume the calculations are correct because the numbers fit the diagram's proportions, ignoring the sign laws. Advanced students will quickly spot that both equations are algebraically impossible.
