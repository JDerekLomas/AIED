This is a classic "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS) question. Despite its simplicity, it is one of the most reliable predictors of mathematical fluency in Key Stage 3 and 4.

The primary distractor here is **A (27)**, which results from performing the calculation from left to right ($5 + 4 = 9$, then $9 \times 3 = 27$). This is the most common error for students who have not yet internalised the rule that multiplication takes precedence over addition. **Option C (60)** is a "double error" (adding 5+4, then multiplying by 3, but then perhaps trying to multiply by 5 again or simply a wild guess), and **Option D (12)** is a common "number salad" guess or a result of adding all three digits.

For **Below Basic** students, the "left-to-right" intuitive approach is the default. Many will not even realise this is a BIDMAS question. For **Proficient** students, the "left-to-right" trap is well-known, but under exam pressure, a small percentage still revert to it. **Advanced** students see this as trivial.

below_basic: A=65% B=20% C=10% D=5%
basic: A=45% B=45% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=88% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=1% D=0%
