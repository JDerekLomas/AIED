To solve this problem, a student must set up and solve the linear equation:
$4x + (2x - 12) + (4x + 42) = 180$
$10x + 30 = 180$
$10x = 150 \Rightarrow x = 15$

**Teacher's Analysis:**
This question is a multi-step algebraic geometry problem. The arithmetic is relatively "kind" ($10x + 30$), which prevents many students from making calculation errors once the equation is formed. 
*   **Option A (15):** The correct answer.
*   **Option B (12.6):** This comes from failing to combine the constants correctly (e.g., $10x + 54 = 180$ or $10x = 126$), or simply a "guess" because the number looks more like a typical "difficult" decimal answer.
*   **Option C (33):** This results from a "sum to 360" error, treating the triangle like a quadrilateral $(10x + 30 = 360 \Rightarrow 10x = 330 \Rightarrow x = 33)$. This is a common high-frequency error for middle-ability students.
*   **Option D (21):** This results from subtracting 30 from 180 and accidentally dividing by 7 or another transcription error, or confusing $4+4+2$ for another combination.
