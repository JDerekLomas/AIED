As a UK maths teacher, I’ve seen thousands of students tackle algebraic fractions. Here is my analysis of how students would perform on this specific question:

**Analysis:**
This question tests the addition of algebraic fractions with different (but related) denominators.
*   **The Trap (Option B):** Students at the lower end of the ability spectrum often "add across," treating the numerators and denominators as independent sums ($3+4=7$ and $2x+x=3x$). 
*   **The Trap (Option D):** This is a very common "halfway" error where students recognize $2x$ is the common denominator, add the numerators ($3+4=7$), but fail to adjust the second numerator ($4 \rightarrow 8$).
*   **The Correct Logic (Option A):** The second fraction must be equivalent to $\frac{8}{2x}$, making the sum $\frac{3+8}{2x} = \frac{11}{2x}$.
*   **Why it's tricky:** The denominators are "too similar." Many students see $x$ and $2x$ and assume they can just add the numbers because they are in the same "family," leading them to B or D.

**Predicted Percentages:**
