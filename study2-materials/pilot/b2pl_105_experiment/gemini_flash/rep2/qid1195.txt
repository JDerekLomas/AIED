This question is a classic test of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). The primary challenge is whether the student will perform the squaring operation before the multiplication.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A (18):** The correct answer ($2 \times 9$).
*   **B (12):** A common misconception where students multiply the base by the index ($3 \times 2 = 6$) and then multiply by 2.
*   **C (36):** A common BIDMAS error where students multiply the bases first $(2 \times 3 = 6)$ and then square the result ($6^2 = 36$).
*   **D (11):** Usually a calculation error or a misunderstanding of indices where $3^2$ is treated as $3 + 2$ or $3 \times 3 + 2$.

**Student Behaviour:**
At the **below_basic** level, the mistake of multiplying the base by the exponent ($3 \times 2 = 6$) is very frequent, often leading to 12. At the **basic** level, the "left-to-right" instinct is very strong, leading many students to choose 36 (multiplying before squaring). By **proficient**, most students remember to prioritize indices, though some still fall for the left-to-right trap under time pressure. **Advanced** students perform this task with high fluency.

below_basic: A=30% B=35% C=25% D=10%
basic: A=55% B=15% C=25% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=9% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
