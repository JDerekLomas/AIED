As a UK maths teacher, here is my analysis of how students would approach this specific question.

This question tests understanding of inverse operations and manipulation of equations.
- **Tom's logic:** He has attempted to eliminate the denominator by multiplying by 5. However, while he (incorrectly) thought he divided 40 by 5 ($40 \div 5 = 8$), he actually needed to multiply ($40 \times 5 = 200$). Tom is incorrect.
- **Katie's logic:** She has attempted to simplify the numerator by dividing by 8. She correctly divided $8x$ by 8 to get $x$, and correctly divided 40 by 8 to get 5. Katie is correct.

**The Trap:** Many "below basic" students struggle with equations where the variable is part of a fraction. They often "cross-apply" operations (e.g., seeing the 8 and 40 and thinking 5, or seeing 5 and 40 and thinking 8) without regards to the equals sign. Tom's suggestion of "8" looks very attractive to a student who sees $40$ and $5$ and instinctively wants to divide them.

**Ability Level Breakdown:**
- **Below Basic:** These students often guess based on number bonds they recognize. Seeing $40 \div 5 = 8$ makes Tom look right; seeing $40 \div 8 = 5$ makes Katie look right. Many will choose "Both" because both lines contain "sensible" numbers.
- **Basic:** Students at this level start to perform one step correctly. They are more likely to recognize that dividing both sides by 8 (Katie) is a valid move, but may still be lured by Tom’s 8 because they know a "5" and a "40" should result in an "8".
- **Proficient:** These students generally test the operations. They will see that $40 \times 5$ should be 200, making Tom wrong, and $40 \div 8$ is 5, making Katie right.
- **Advanced:** These students will instantly identify Katie’s move as dividing both sides by the coefficient of $x$.

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=40% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0% D=1%
