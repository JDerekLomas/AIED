As an experienced maths teacher, I find rearranging formulas involving fractions to be a significant "bottleneck" for students. 

While the concept of a triangle is familiar, the presence of the fraction $\frac{1}{2}$ triggers specific errors. **Option C** is the most common trap for average students; they see the $2$ and the $b$ on the same side and move them both to the denominator without considering the reciprocal nature of dividing by a fraction. **Option A** attracts lower-ability students who simply swap letters around (pseudo-algebra) thinking that making $h$ the subject just means putting it on the left and moving $A$ into the bracket. **Option D** is a distractor that few choose unless they are overthinking.

**Option B** is the correct rearrangement ($2A = bh \Rightarrow h = \frac{2A}{b}$), which requires two distinct steps or an understanding of multiplying by the reciprocal.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=65% C=22% D=3%
advanced: A=2% B=94% C=3% D=1%
