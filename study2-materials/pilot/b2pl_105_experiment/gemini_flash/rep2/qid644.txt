This question specifically tests a student's ability to handle negative numbers within the context of expanding brackets (specifically the "Last" term in the FOIL method). 

The common pitfalls here are:
1.  **Sign errors**: Multiplying two negatives to get a negative (Option B). This is the most common error in bracket expansion.
2.  **Operation confusion**: Adding the numbers (-1 and -4) instead of multiplying them, leading to -5 (Option D).
3.  **Combination error**: Adding the numbers but failing the sign rule, leading to +5 (Option C).

Because the question explicitly points to the terms using arrows, it removes the cognitive load of "FOIL" and isolates the arithmetic. This makes it slightly easier than a full expansion, but the negative signs remain a significant barrier for lower-ability students.
