This question addresses two distinct aspects of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

**Problem P ($4-5+6$)** tests the common misconception that Addition must come before Subtraction because 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym. In reality, they have equal priority and should be calculated left-to-right. This is a very persistent error even among proficient students.
**Problem Q ($4+5 \times 6$)** tests the standard hierarchy where Multiplication clearly takes precedence over Addition.

**Why Option D is a powerful distractor:** Many students are taught "Addition before Subtraction" so rigidly that they will select $5+6$ as the first step for Problem P.
**Why Option B is the correct answer:** It correctly identifies the left-to-right rule for P and the priority of multiplication for Q.

Below-basic students often default to reading everything left-to-right (Option A). Proficient students often fall into the "A before S" trap (Option D). Only advanced students consistently recognize that Addition and Subtraction are equal priority.

below_basic: A=50% B=20% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=5% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=45% C=5% D=40%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=0% D=15%
