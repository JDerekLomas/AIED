This question tests a student's ability to translate a multi-step word problem into algebraic notation, specifically looking for an understanding of the order of operations and the role of the vinculum (the fraction bar) as a grouping symbol.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **The Trap (Option B):** This is the classic "direct translation" error. Students who read left-to-right without considering BIDMAS will choose $n - 6 \div 3 = 21$. This is the most common distractor for lower-to-middle ability students.
*   **The Structure (Option A vs D):** The phrase "divide the result by three" is the key. Students who have been well-drilled in "Function Machines" or reverse operations often recognise the grouping, but those who are still developing algebraic fluency struggle to distinguish between $\frac{n-6}{3}$ and $\frac{n}{3} - 6$.
*   **The Misinterpretation (Option C):** This represents a student who confuses "divide" with "multiply," perhaps through a misread or a misunderstanding of inverse operations in this specific context.

In UK classrooms, Year 7-9 students are frequently exposed to "I think of a number" problems. While the misconception in B is "textbook," modern pedagogy emphasizes that "the whole result" needs a big fraction bar, making A relatively accessible for proficient students.
