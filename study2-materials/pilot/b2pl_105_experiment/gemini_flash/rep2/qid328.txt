As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as a classic test of whether students can handle adding fractions with different denominators. 

Option **B** is the "classic" misconception (adding the numerators and the denominators: $2+1$ and $9+3$). Option **C** represents students who forget to find a common denominator and simply add the numerators while keeping the first denominator they see. Option **D** is a distractor for those who might try to multiply or perform incorrect reciprocal operations.

This specific question is relatively straightforward because the common denominator (9) is a multiple of the other (3), meaning only one fraction needs to be converted. However, at the lower levels, the "add across" error is extremely persistent.

**below_basic:** A=20% B=55% C=15% D=10%
(Students at this level almost instinctively add across numerators and denominators.)

**basic:** A=55% B=25% C=15% D=5%
(Students here often know they need a common denominator but frequently make errors in conversion or slip back into adding across when pressured.)

**proficient:** A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
(Most proficient students identify that $1/3 = 3/9$. The few errors remaining are usually due to calculation haste.)

**advanced:** A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
(This is a foundational skill for advanced students; errors are purely accidental.)

below_basic: A=20% B=55% C=15% D=10%
basic: A=55% B=25% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
