This question is a classic "sign vs. magnitude" trap. While the calculation $2^4 = 16$ is relatively straightforward for mid-to-high ability students, the interaction between the negative base and the even exponent is where the primary error occurs.

The presence of the brackets is the crucial discriminator here. Students at lower levels often ignore the brackets or have been conditioned by their calculators (where $-2^4$ without brackets equals $-16$) to believe that a negative number raised to a power stays negative regardless. Option B is a common "multiplication instead of exponentiation" error ($-2 \times 4$).

**below_basic:** These students struggle with indices and the rules of directed numbers. Many will simply do $2 \times 4$ and carry the sign over, or assume all powers of negative numbers remain negative.
**basic:** These students know $2^4 = 16$, but have a weak grasp of the "even power equals positive" rule. This group is most susceptible to choosing A because they don't process the brackets correctly.
**proficient:** These students generally know the rule that an even power results in a positive answer. However, under exam pressure, a significant minority will still default to the intuitive (but wrong) "negative stays negative" logic.
**advanced:** These students have mastered index laws and directed numbers; they recognize this as a standard check of the "brackets vs. no brackets" rule and will almost all select C.

below_basic: A=35% B=40% C=10% D=15%
basic: A=45% B=15% C=35% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=5% C=73% D=2%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=95% D=0%
