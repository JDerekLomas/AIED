As an experienced UK maths teacher, I see this specific question as a classic test of "integer arithmetic within algebra." While the focus is expanding brackets, the actual task is simply multiplying $-8$ and $-2$.

**Teacher's Insight:**
1.  **The Multiplication vs. Addition Trap:** This is the biggest hurdle. Students at the 'below_basic' level often see two numbers in a bracket and perform the operation for the "middle term" ($-8 - 2 = -10$) rather than the product. This makes **A** a very strong distractor.
2.  **The Sign Rule:** For students who know they need to multiply ($8 \times 2 = 16$), the negative signs are the next hurdle. Many 'basic' students remember "minus and minus makes a plus," but those who are inconsistent or rushing often pick **D** because they think the answer "must stay negative" since the inputs were negative.
3.  **Subtraction Error:** **C** ($-6$) targets students who try to find the difference between 8 and 2, which is less common in this context but happens when students are overwhelmed by signs.

This question is actually harder than it looks for lower-ability students because the context of expanding brackets adds a cognitive load that makes them more likely to revert to addition ($-10$).

below_basic: A=45% B=25% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=55% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=1% B=97% C=0% D=2%
