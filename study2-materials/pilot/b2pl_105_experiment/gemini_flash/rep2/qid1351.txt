This question is a classic "directed numbers" trap. While the algebraic step is simple (subtract 12 from both sides), the arithmetic required is \(-3 - 12\). 

Many students at the lower ability levels will see the 3 and the 12 and perform the subtraction $12 - 3 = 9$. Depending on their intuition, they will either pick **A** (9) or **C** (-9) because "the answer should be negative." Option **B** is the correct answer (\(-15\)), but it requires students to move further away from zero on the number line, which is counter-intuitive for those who equate "subtract" solely with "making the absolute value smaller." 

**Option A (9)** attracts those who flip the equation to $12 - 3$. 
**Option C (-9)** is the most common distractor, as it feels "right" to have a negative result when starting with -3, but students mistakenly find the difference between 3 and 12.
