This is a foundational algebraic fractions question. The denominators are already common ($x$), which significantly simplifies the problem compared to one where the denominators differ. However, the presence of the variable $x$ often triggers a "cross-multiplication" reflex or a misunderstanding of how to combine terms.

**Key Student Behaviors:**
*   **The Correct Logic (Option B):** Students understand that when the denominator is the same, you only add the numerators. This is the simplest possible algebraic addition.
*   **The "Add Everything" Error (Option C):** Students apply the logic of adding numerators and denominators ($2+3=5$ and $x+x=2x$). This is the most common error among lower-ability students.
*   **The "Cross-Multiply/Formulaic" Error (Option A):** These students have been taught a method like $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad+bc}{bd}$ but apply it blindly without noticing the common denominator. $2x + 3x = 5x$ over $x \times x = x^2$. While mathematically equivalent to $5/x$, the instruction says "as simply as possible."
*   **The Multiplication Error (Option D):** These students confuse the operation and multiply the fractions ($2 \times 3 = 6$ and $x \times x = x^2$).

**Ability Level Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often fall for Option C (adding the $x$s) or Option D (multiplying).
*   **Basic:** Mostly get it right, but a significant minority over-complicate it by trying to find a "new" common denominator (Option A).
*   **Proficient/Advanced:** Usually find this trivial, though a tiny percentage of proficient students might over-think it into Option A.
