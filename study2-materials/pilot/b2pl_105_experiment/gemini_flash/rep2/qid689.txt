This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem, which consistently causes higher-than-expected error rates even among reasonably proficient students.

The primary trap here is the **"commmutative misconception"** or the **"large $\div$ small" bias**. Students see the numbers 10 and 5 and their intuition pushes them to perform the operation $10 \div 5$. This leads them directly to **C (p=2)**. While a student might correctly identify that they need to "do something with the 10 and 5," they often fail to manipulate the fraction correctly ($10p = 5$, therefore $p = 5/10$). 

Option **B (p=50)** is the mistake made by students who know they need to "get rid of the divide" but apply the multiplication to the wrong side or simply multiply the two visible digits. Option **A (p=0.5)** is the correct answer but is often avoided by lower-ability students because they are uncomfortable with decimal/fractional results when "cleaner" integers like 2 or 50 are available.

**Teacher's Note:** This specific question is harder than $2 = 10/p$ because the result is less than 1. Students are socially conditioned to expect the answer to be a whole number in early algebra.
