To solve this question, a student must substitute $y = 0.5$ into the equation $10x - 6y = 30$ and solve for $x$:
$10x - 6(0.5) = 30$
$10x - 3 = 30$
$10x = 33$
$x = 3.3$

**Analysis of Difficulties:**
1.  **Algebraic manipulation:** Lower-ability students often struggle with the two-step rearrangement required after substitution. A common error is subtracting 3 from 30 instead of adding it (leading to $10x = 27$, then $x = 2.7$ (Option D)).
2.  **Arithmetic/Decimal confusion:** Option A (4.25) and B (-4.25) are distractor results derived from more significant errors, such as dividing by 4 or misunderstanding the $10x - 3$ step. 
3.  **Variable Swapping:** This is a classic trap. If a student substitutes $x = 0.5$ to find $y$, they get $5 - 6y = 30$, leading to $-6y = 25$, $y = -4.16...$. While not an exact match for B, students often pick the closest decimal.
4.  **Simplicity:** For proficient students, the calculation $30 + 3$ followed by division by 10 is very intuitive.
