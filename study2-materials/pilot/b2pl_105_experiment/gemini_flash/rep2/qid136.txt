This question tests two distinct skills: knowledge of factor pairs (multiplication tables) and the rules for multiplying signed numbers (integers).

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **The Positive Product Trap (Option A):** This is the most common pitfall. Many students see "3 and 8" and "-24" and instinctively connect them because $3 \times 8 = 24$, overlooking that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive.
*   **The Addition/Subtraction Trap (Option C):** Students at the "Below Basic" level often confuse "product" with "sum" or simply look for numbers that "look like" they combine to make 24. $-10 + -14 = -24$, which is a very attractive distractor for those who confuse operations.
*   **The Guessing Trap (Option D):** This tests simple multiplication facts ($3 \times 9 = 27$); it's there to catch students who have weak times-tables or are rushing and see a negative sign and a 3.

Option B is the correct answer because a negative multiplied by a positive yields a negative.

**Predicted Student Performance:**

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=55% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=15% B=82% C=2% D=1%
advanced: A=3% B=96% C=1% D=0%
