This question is a classic "fractional trap" in one-step linear equations. While the operation required is simple division by 3, the presence of the fraction $\frac{1}{12}$ triggers two major cognitive shortcuts in lower-ability students:
1. **The Inverse Operation Confusion:** Students see the 3 and the 12 and perform $12 \div 3 = 4$, leading them to Option A ($1/4$) or Option C ($4$).
2. **The Multiplication Error:** Even students who know they must divide by 3 often struggle with the mechanics of dividing a fraction by an integer, mistakenly multiplying the numerator instead of the denominator (Option D).

The most common wrong answer is typically A, because the visual relationship between 3 and 12 is so strong that students "simplify" the problem into $12 \div 3$ without considering the fractional structure.
