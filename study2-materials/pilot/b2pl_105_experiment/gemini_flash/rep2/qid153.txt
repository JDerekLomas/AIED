This linear equation is a classic "directionality and division" trap for UK students in Key Stage 3 and 4 (GCSE). While the algebra is one-step after moving the constant, students frequently struggle when the divisor is larger than the dividend, leading to the "big divided by small" error.

**Analysis of student performance:**
*   **The Division Error:** The most common mistake is calculating $12 \div 3$ instead of $3 \div 12$, leading to an answer of 4 (Option B).
*   **The Sign Error:** Students often forget that moving $-3$ across the equals sign makes it positive, or they perform the division and then incorrectly apply a negative sign because the original equation had a minus (Option A and C).
*   **Difficulty Level:** This is moderately difficult for lower-ability students because the answer is a fraction/decimal rather than an integer.
