To predict how students will perform on this specific double inequality, we have to consider the steps involved: subtracting 1 from all three parts and then dividing by 2.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **A is the correct answer.** \((-3 - 1 = -4\); \(-4 \div 2 = -2\)) and (\(7 - 1 = 6\); \(6 \div 2 = 3\)).
*   **B is a common procedural error.** Students often "do the same to both sides" but treat the middle as if they are only working with the right-hand side, or they might incorrectly calculate \(-3 + 1 = -2\) (adding instead of subtracting) then divide by 2.
*   **C represents a common "BIDMAS in reverse" error.** Students might divide by 2 first (\(-1.5 < x + 1 < 3.5\)) but forget to divide the \(+1\) as well, then subtract 1 from the ends.
*   **D represents the "misapplied inverse" error.** Students multiply by 2 and add 1 instead of dividing by 2 and subtracting 1.

**Difficulty assessment:**
This is a standard higher-tier GCSE question or an upper-intermediate Foundation question. The negative number \(-3\) is the main "trap." Many students handle the right side (\(7 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 3\)) perfectly but stumble on the calculation \(-3 - 1\), often getting \(-2\) instead of \(-4\).
