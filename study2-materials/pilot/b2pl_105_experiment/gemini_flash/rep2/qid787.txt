In this equation ($2v - 5 = 6v - 3$), the ambiguity lies in how students handle the negative signs when moving constants. 

Jo’s step ($2v - 8 = 6v$) requires subtracting 3 from both sides. However, because the right side is $-3$, subtracting 3 should result in $-6$ (if they were trying to move it) or, more likely, Jo has incorrectly added $-3$ and $-5$ to get $-8$ while attempting to "move" the 3.

Paul’s step ($2v = 6v - 8$) involves adding 5 to both sides. $-3 + 5$ is actually $+2$, but many students will incorrectly perform $-3 - 5$ to get $-8$, or simply see the 5 and 3 and subtract them without regard for the signs.

The trap here is that both Jo and Paul have made the same directional or sign error, leading to the same incorrect constant (-8), but many students will see the number 8 and assume at least one of them (usually the one who "moved" the number they personally would have moved) is correct. 

**below_basic:** A=25% B=25% C=35% D=15%
Students at this level often think that if a problem features two people, one of them "must" be right. They will struggle with directed number arithmetic (-5 and -3) and often think $5+3=8$ means 8 must be involved correctly.

**basic:** A=20% B=25% C=40% D=15%
Basic students are prone to the "change the side, change the sign" rule but often apply it inconsistently. They see the 8 and assume the arithmetic is correct, often choosing "Both" because the 8 appears in both equations.

**proficient:** A=15% B=15% C=25% D=45%
Proficient students will check the arithmetic. They will realize $-5 + 3 = -2$ and $-3 + 5 = 2$. They are more likely to spot that neither reached a correct next step, though some will still fall for the "8" trap if they are rushing.

**advanced:** A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
Advanced students will mentally perform the first step (e.g., $2v = 6v + 2$ or $-2 = 4v$) and immediately recognize that the constant -8 is a result of a sign error for both parties.

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=35% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=15% C=25% D=45%
advanced: A=05% B=05% C=05% D=85%
