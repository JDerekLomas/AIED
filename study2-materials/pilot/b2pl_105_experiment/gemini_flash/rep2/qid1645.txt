In this equation, $3p^2 + 9 = 39$, students must perform three distinct steps: subtract 9, divide by 3, and take the square root. 

The primary "trap" is the common arithmetic error where students skip the division by 3 and try to square root $(39-9) = 30$, leading to Option B. There is also a variable name change in Option A ($n$ instead of $p$) which serves as a distractor for students who guess or focus only on the value. Option D tests the misconception that you square root before dividing ($39 - 9 = 30$; $30 \times 3 = 90$ or similar confusion).

Most UK students find rearranging equations with squares reasonably manageable, but many will forget the negative square root or stumble on the order of operations (BIDMAS in reverse).
