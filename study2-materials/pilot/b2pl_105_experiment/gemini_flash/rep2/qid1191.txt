In this linear equation, the unknown $t$ appears on both sides. While the algebra is standard, students at lower ability levels often struggle with the "moving" of terms, specifically handling the signs when constants and variables are gathered. 

A common error here is the "sign flip" or "incorrect operation" mistake: students might subtract $5t$ from $20t$ (getting $15t$) but then subtract $10$ from $5$ (or vice versa) to get $5$ or $-5$, leading towards fractions like $1/3$ or $1$. However, the most frequent mistake in a multiple-choice context for this specific equation is treating the $-5$ and $+10$ as additive, resulting in $15t = 15$, hence $t=1$. 

Option A (0) is a common "guess" for students who become overwhelmed by variables. Option C (-1) catches those who manage to get $15t = -15$ through a sign error during the transition of the constant. Option D (1/5) is a distractor for those who perform the final division backwards ($3/15$ instead of $15/15$, or similar arithmetic confusion).
