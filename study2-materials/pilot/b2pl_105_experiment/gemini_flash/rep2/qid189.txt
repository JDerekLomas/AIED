This question tests the substitution of a positive integer into a linear $n$th term formula. While the substitution itself is straightforward ($1 - 3 \times 15$), the presence of a negative coefficient and the order of operations are the primary "filters" for student ability.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **A) -44:** The correct answer ($1 - 45 = -44$).
*   **B) -46:** A very common calculation error where students find $1 - 45$ but think "the difference between 1 and 45 is 44, then move one more away from zero" or simply perform $-(1 + 45)$.
*   **C) -14:** The "Calculation Order" error. Students do $1 - 3 = -2$, then multiply by $15$. This is a classic "left-to-right" error that bypasses BIDMAS.
*   **D) -30:** This is usually a result of "Logic Fatigue"—students see $3n$ and $15$, they might just double it or miscalculate $3 \times 15$ as $30$ (confusing it with $2 \times 15$ or $3 \times 10$).

**Difficulty Rating:** 
For **below_basic** students, the negative result is a significant hurdle. Many will default to option C because they lack the confidence to handle the $3n$ term separately from the $1$.
**Proficient** students rarely miss the BIDMAS rule but can occasionally make the "off by one" sign error (Option B).

basic: A=65% B=15% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
