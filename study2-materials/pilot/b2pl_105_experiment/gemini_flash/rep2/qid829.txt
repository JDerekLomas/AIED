This quadratic expansion question targets two specific areas of difficulty for students: the addition of two negative coefficients to form the linear term (-3 + -2 = -5) and the multiplication of two negatives to form the constant term (-3 × -2 = +6).

A common error in UK classrooms for "Basic" level students is "sign confusion" during the final multiplication, where they assume the presence of minus signs in the brackets must result in a minus sign in the answer, or they correctly identify the 5 but fail on the +6. "Below Basic" students often struggle with directed number addition, sometimes reaching -1m (Option B) by subtracting the absolute values rather than adding them.

However, because this is a standard "double bracket" expansion, students at "Proficient" level and above have usually drilled the FOIL or grid method sufficiently to handle the double negative correctly.

below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=88% B=4% C=3% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
