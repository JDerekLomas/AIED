This question specifically tests the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). While it looks simple, it is highly effective at triggering the "left-to-right" bias.

Students at **below_basic** and **basic** levels almost always read mathematics like a sentence, performing operations as they encounter them. For these students, the subtraction $10-8$ appears first, making Option B the most common trap. 

Students at the **proficient** level have usually memorised the BIDMAS acronym, but often struggle with the "Addition and Subtraction" or "Multiplication and Division" parity. However, because "Multiplication" (M) comes before "Addition" (A) and "Subtraction" (S) in the acronym, many proficient students will correctly identify the multiplication first, though a significant minority will be tempted by the addition $7+6$ because 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym (a very common UK misconception).

**Advanced** students recognise the hierarchy instantly and are not distracted by the linear layout.

below_basic: A=15% B=65% C=15% D=5%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=15% B=10% C=73% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=97% D=0%
