As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on how students handle the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) within algebraic notation.

**Analysis:**
This question specifically tests whether students recognise that $ab$ implies multiplication and that this operation must be performed before addition. 
*   **The Trap:** Options C and D are "reading left to right" errors. In my experience, weaker students tend to process mathematical strings linearly. They see $3 + a$ first and assume that addition happens before the multiplication.
*   **The Notation:** $ab$ is generally well-understood as multiplication by the time students reach GCSE, but when combined with a constant, the $3+a$ chunk is a strong visual distractor.
*   **Discriminator:** The main separator here is the understanding of term order versus written order.

**Student Performance Predictions:**

**Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the "invisible" multiplication sign in $ab$ and almost always read from left to right. They are likely to be split between C (direct left-to-right) and B (assuming the letters should be grouped).
**Basic:** These students usually know $ab$ means $a \times b$, but frequently forget to apply BIDMAS when a sum is presented horizontally. Option C is a very common pitfall for this group.
**Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of BIDMAS and recognize that the product $ab$ is a single term that must be calculated before the 3 is added.
**Advanced:** These students will find this trivial. The only errors here would be through extreme overthinking or misreading the question.

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=35% D=15%
basic: A=55% B=10% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=2% C=10% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
