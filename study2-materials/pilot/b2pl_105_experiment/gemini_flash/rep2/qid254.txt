As a UK maths teacher, I see this specific question as a subtle test of two distinct areas: the role of zero in data sets and the understanding of formal mathematical notation (specifically BIDMAS/Order of Operations).

**A** is the correct answer. Even though 0 doesn't change the sum, it is a data point and must be included in the count of the denominator ($n=5$).
**B** is a "calculator trap." If typed into a standard scientific calculator exactly as written without brackets, BIDMAS rules mean only the 7 is divided by 5.
**C** is the classic misconception that zero "doesn't count" and can be ignored entirely.

Low-ability students often ignore zero (C) or fail to understand that a fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol (choosing B because it "looks" like the sum then a division). High-ability students occasionally overthink and choose D if they believe 0 *must* be explicitly written in the numerator, but most will recognise that $0+1+3+4+7$ is mathematically identical to $1+3+4+7$.

Predictive percentages:
