This question is a classic "trap" in the GCSE curriculum. While finding the gradient of $y=mx+c$ is straightforward, students frequently struggle when the equation is in the form $ax+by=c$.

The most common errors here are:
1.  **Coefficient Spotting (Option A):** Identifying the coefficient of $x$ as the gradient without rearranging.
2.  **Ratio Error (Option C):** Dividing the coefficient of $x$ by the coefficient of $y$ but forgetting to account for the sign change when moving the $5x$ to the other side of the equals sign.
3.  **Basic Rearranging (Option B):** Seeing the $+5x$ and assuming it becomes $-5$ without considering the $3y$.

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** Most will simply look for a number in the equation. '5' is the first number they see, making A a very popular guess.
*   **Basic:** They know the gradient involves both numbers but usually try to "shortcut" the process. Option C is a very common distractor here as they divide $5$ by $3$ but miss the negative sign.
*   **Proficient:** These students know they need to rearrange into $y=mx+c$. However, under time pressure, a significant number will calculate $3y = -5x + 15$ but then make a sign error or lose the negative during the division step.
*   **Advanced:** Most will correctly rearrange to $y = -\frac{5}{3}x + 5$ and identify $-\frac{5}{3}$. The only errors here are usually due to extreme haste.
