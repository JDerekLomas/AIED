This question tests the transition from arithmetic notation to algebraic fractional notation. While it appears straightforward, the placement of the bracket and the "dividend vs. divisor" relationship are common points of confusion for students at lower attainment levels.

**Analysis of the Question:**
- **The Core Task:** Recognising that the division sign $(\div)$ translates to a fraction bar, where the first term is the numerator and everything in the bracket is the denominator.
- **Option B** is a "filler" error where students might try to distribute the $c$ or assume the $+4$ applies to both.
- **Option C** is a classic order-of-operations/notation error where the student ignores the significance of the bracket, effectively calculating $c \div h + 4$.
- **Option D** is the most common conceptual error: the "reversal." Students often put the "bigger" expression (more terms) on top or simply flip the fraction.

**Student Performance Predictions:**
At the **below_basic** level, students often struggle with the direction of division, leading to a high percentage choosing D. They also often struggle to see the bracketed expression as a single unit, leading to C.
At the **basic** level (GCSE Grade 3/4), students are generally aware that division looks like a fraction, but "reversal" errors (D) and neglecting brackets (C) remain significant traps.
At the **proficient** level (GCSE Grade 5/6), most students identify that $c$ must be the numerator and that the $+4$ is tied to the $h$.
At the **advanced** level, this is a "gimme" question with very high accuracy.

basic: A=65% B=5% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=88% B=2% C=4% D=6%
advanced: A=98% B=0% C=1% D=1%
