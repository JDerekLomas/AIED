In this question, the presence of three different operations (subtraction, division, and indices) tests a student's adherence to the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

The most common error in order-of-operations questions is simply working from left to right (Option C). However, when an index/power is involved, many students have a "priority bias" where they recognize that the small number (the exponent) must be dealt with immediately, even if they usually struggle with division versus subtraction.

**Below Basic:** These students often default to reading left-to-right. A significant portion will choose C ($8-7$) because it is the first calculation and results in a "nice" number (1). Some will guess B because the division looks central, but C is the primary trap.
**Basic:** Students at this level usually know the BIDMAS acronym but often get confused between the 'I' (Indices) and 'D' (Division). While many will correctly identify that the power comes first, a large group will still fall for the left-to-right trap (C).
**Proficient:** These students generally have the order of operations internalised. They know Indices come before Division and Subtraction. Very few will choose C or D. A small number might be tempted by B if they misremember the order of the acronym.
**Advanced:** These students will almost universally identify that Indices ($6^3$) must be calculated first.

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=45% D=5%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=28% D=2%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=9% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
