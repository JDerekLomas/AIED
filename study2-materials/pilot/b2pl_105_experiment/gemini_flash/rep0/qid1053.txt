This question tests a student's ability to factorise a quadratic trinomial where the constant term is negative and the coefficient of $x$ is $-1$. 

The main difficulty here lies in "sign management." Students often find the factors 3 and 2 easily, but struggle to determine which should be negative to sum to $-1$. Option D is the most common "distractor" because students associate a negative result in the expression with the second sign in the brackets, or simply mix up the subtraction $2 - 3$ vs $3 - 2$. Options B and C are chosen by students who struggle with the rule that a negative constant term $(-6)$ requires one positive and one negative sign in the binomials.

**Teacher's Insight:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often guess based on the numbers 3 and 2. They might choose C simply because they prefer positive signs or B because they see two minus signs in the question and assume there should be two in the answer.
*   **Basic:** They know they need a + and a -, narrowing it to A and D. This is where the 50/50 "sign error" occurs.
*   **Proficient:** Usually expand to check their work and will catch the fact that $3x - 2x = +x$ (Option D), thus correcting themselves to choose A.
*   **Advanced:** Will identify the correct pair almost instantly with very high accuracy.
