As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this question by looking at the interaction between the implicit form of the equation ($ax + by = c$) and the most common substitution errors. 

The equation $4x + 2y = 10$ is more challenging than the standard $y = mx + c$ format. For $x=0$, students must solve $2y=10$.
- **Option C (5)** is correct ($2y = 10 \Rightarrow y = 5$).
- **Option B (3)** is a common error where students subtract coefficients or confuse the constants ($10 - 4 - 3$ or similar arithmetic slips).
- **Option D (2.5)** is a major "trap" for students who instinctively divide the result by the wrong coefficient (10/4) or apply a $y = mx + c$ logic incorrectly.
- **Option A (20)** is for students who multiply the coefficients ($4 \times 5$ or $2 \times 10$) without understanding the equals sign.

Because $x=0$ is the value being tested, the $4x$ term vanishes, making this significantly easier than if $x$ were 1 or 2. Even lower-ability students often handle "zero" well, though many still struggle with the $2y=10$ step.
