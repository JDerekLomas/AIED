As an experienced UK maths teacher, I find that rearranging formulas involving squares and divisions is a classic discriminator at GCSE. 

The most common errors here involve "operation order" and "algebraic notation." Students often struggle with whether to square root before or after dividing by $r$. There is also a visual confusion between multiplication and division. Option A is a "panic" choice for students who don't understand inverse operations, while Options C and D represent partial understanding where the student knows a square root is required but mishandles the $r$.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

**below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=25% D=15%**
Students at this level often treat algebra as "moving things to the other side" without changing operations correctly. They see the square and sometimes think they should square the other side (A) or just guess between the options containing roots.

**basic: A=15% B=45% C=20% D=20%**
Students here know they need to divide and square root. However, many will fail to realise the root must cover the entire fraction. Option C is a common trap for students who think moving $r$ "up" makes it multiply. Option D is a very common error where they root the $F$ but leave the $r$ outside the root.

**proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%**
Most students at this level can successfully perform the two-step rearrangement ($F/r = \omega^2$, then root). The main error remaining is forgetting that the $r$ must also be under the radical sign.

**advanced: A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%**
Top-tier students see this as a standard two-step manipulation. Unless they make a transcription error, they will almost always identify the correct inverse operations in the correct order.
