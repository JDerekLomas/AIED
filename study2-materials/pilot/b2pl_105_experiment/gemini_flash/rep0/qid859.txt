This linear equation contains variables on both sides and negative terms, which is a classic hurdle in KS3 and GCSE maths. 

The most significant distractor here is **Option A ($d=0$)**. Many students struggle with "balancing" negative constants. When they see $-3$ and $+3$, they often incorrectly combine them to get $0$ rather than adding $3$ to both sides. Furthermore, many students instinctively feel that if an equation looks "balanced" (with 3s on both sides), the answer must be zero.

**Option B ($d=1$)** attracts those who make a sign error when moving the constants, effectively calculating $12d - 6d = 3 + 3$, leading to $6d = 6$. This is a very common "successful" error path.

**Option D ($d=1/3$)** is the result of "small number divided by big number" ($2 \div 6$), which often happens if students subtract 3 from both sides incorrectly ($12d - 6d = 3 - 3 \implies 6d = 0$, but then they get muddled with the coefficients).
