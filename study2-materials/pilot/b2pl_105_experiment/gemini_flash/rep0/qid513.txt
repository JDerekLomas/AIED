As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as one that specifically targets "inverse operation" confusion. 

In **Step 1**, Isaac has subtracted 4 from 15 ($15 - 4 = 11$) instead of adding it. This is the most common error in two-step equations—misidentifying which operation "undoes" a subtraction. 
In **Step 2**, Isaac has multiplied by 2 ($11 \times 2 = 22$) instead of dividing by 2. 

Low-ability students often look for "familiar" numbers. They see 15 and 4 and want to make 11; they see 11 and 2 and want to make 22 or 5.5. Because both steps use a "valid" number operation (even if the inverse is wrong), many students will find Isaac's logic plausible. 

However, because *both* steps are mathematically incorrect, more able students will quickly solve the equation themselves ($p = 9.5$) and realise neither step matches their work.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=15% B=5% C=5% D=75%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=1% D=96%
