This question is significantly more difficult than a standard "complete the table of values" question because it involves a decimal input ($x=0.3$) and a linear equation in the form $ax + by = c$ rather than the explicit $y = mx + c$. 

**Teacher’s Analysis:**
1.  **The Substitution Trap:** Students substitute $0.3$: $2(0.3) + 3y = 12 \rightarrow 0.6 + 3y = 12$.
2.  **Arithmetic Errors:** The most common mistake is $12 - 0.6 = 11.4$. Then, $11.4 \div 3$. 
3.  **The "Integers Only" Misconception:** Lower-ability students often struggle with the $0.6$. Some might simply ignore the decimal and treat it as $2(3) + 3y = 12 \rightarrow 6 + 3y = 12 \rightarrow y=2$, but since $2$ isn't an option, they will look for numbers close to $4$ (since $2x + 3y = 12$ gives $y=4$ when $x=0$).
4.  **Common Distractors:**
    *   **3.8 (Correct):** $11.4 \div 3 = 3.8$.
    *   **4.1/3.9:** These are "common sense" guesses for students who know $y$ must be slightly less than 4 (the y-intercept), but cannot perform the division.
    *   **4.2:** This often comes from an addition error ($12 + 0.6 = 12.6$, then $12.6 \div 3 = 4.2$).
