This is a relatively straightforward addition of mixed numbers because the denominators are the same and the sum of the fractional parts ($1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5$) does not require regrouping or "carrying" into the whole numbers.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **A (Correct):** The vast majority of students will find this easy. Adding the whole numbers ($2+1=3$) and the numerators ($1+2=3$) while keeping the denominator the same is the standard intuitive approach.
*   **B (Improper Fraction):** This is the correct value but not in the requested "mixed number" format. Higher-ability students rarely make this mistake unless they overthink the question, but lower-ability students who have recently been drilled on converting to improper fractions might stop here.
*   **C (Adding Numerators and Denominators):** This represents a classic "below basic" error where the student adds everything ($2+1=3$ for whole numbers is ignored or lost, then $1+2$ and $5+5$).
*   **D (Adding Denominators):** This is the most common error for "basic" students who know to add the whole numbers but forget the rules for fractions, erroneously adding $5+5$ to get $10$.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=70% B=5% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=92% B=3% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
