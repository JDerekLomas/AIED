As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this question as a classic test of independent events and the "AND" rule (multiplication) vs. the "OR" rule (addition). 

The common pitfalls for this specific question are:
1. **Adding the denominators (A):** Students who think there are $4 + 5 = 9$ total possibilities, seeing the 1 on the first spinner as $1$ out of $9$.
2. **Adding the probabilities (C):** Students who incorrectly use addition for independent events ($\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{9}{20}$, but then often get confused and think $1+1=2$ for the numerator over the combined outcomes). 
3. **Miscounting outcomes (D):** Selecting $\frac{2}{20}$ because they see two spinners and think there are "2 ways" to get a 1, or simply doubling the numerator.

This question is moderately difficult for lower-ability students because the denominators are different (4 and 5), which often triggers a "let's just add the 4 and 5" reflex to create a denominator of 9.

Here is the predicted distribution:

basic: A=25% B=45% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
