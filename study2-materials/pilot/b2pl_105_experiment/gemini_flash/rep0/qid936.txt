This question is a classic test of directed numbers and sign conventions within the context of factorising quadratics. 

Tom's statement is the "standard" positive example $(+3 \times +2 = +6$ and $+3 + 2 = +5)$, which most students find straightforward. Katie's statement is the trap. Students often focus on the digits $3$ and $2$ summing to $5$ and their product being $6$, but they frequently fail to check the sign of the constant term. For Katie's expansion to be correct, the constant would need to be $+6$ (since $-3 \times -2 = +6$). Because the question asks for $-6$, Katie is wrong. 

Low-ability students often see the $5$ and $6$ and the negative signs in both expressions and assume "negative numbers work the same way as positives," leading them to choose C. High-ability students will quickly spot that $-3 \times -2$ cannot result in the $-6$ shown in Katie's expression.
