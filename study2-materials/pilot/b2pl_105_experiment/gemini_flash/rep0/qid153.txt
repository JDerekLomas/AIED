This linear equation tests two primary skills: the ability to handle basic two-step operations and the specific ability to divide the smaller number by the larger number.

The most common trap in this question is the "big number divided by small number" reflex. Students often see $12$ and $3$ and automatically conclude the answer must be $4$ or $-4$ because $12 \div 3 = 4$ is a more "natural" calculation for those at lower ability levels than $3 \div 12 = 0.25$. 

Option B is the strongest distractor for Basic students. Option A attracts those who understand the fraction but make a sign error when moving the $-3$ across the equals sign. Proficient and Advanced students are unlikely to fall for the integer division trap.
