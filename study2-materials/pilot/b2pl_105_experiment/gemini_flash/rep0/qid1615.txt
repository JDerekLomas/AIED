This question tests a student's ability to translate compound operations into algebraic notation, specifically focusing on the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

The main "trap" here is Option B. Students who read left-to-right without considering algebraic syntax often choose $n - 6 \div 3 = 21$, not realising that mathematically this implies the division happens before the subtraction. Option D is a common error for those who confuse the order of operations in the sentence. Option C reflects a confusion between "multiply" and "divide" or a misreading of the inverse.

For **below_basic** students, the "left-to-right" reading strategy is dominant, making B very attractive. **Basic** students often recognize that a fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol but can still be swayed by the literal appearance of the numbers in sequence. **Proficient** students usually identify the fraction bar as the correct way to show "the result" being divided, though a small number may still rush and pick D.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=45% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
