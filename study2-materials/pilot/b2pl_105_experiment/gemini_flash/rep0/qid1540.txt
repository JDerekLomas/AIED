Substituting $x = -1$ into a quadratic is a classic "danger zone" for UK students, primarily because of the interaction between negative numbers and squaring. 

The most common error is calculating $(-1)^2$ as $-1$ rather than $1$. If a student calculates $-1 - 2(-1) + 1$, they get $-1 + 2 + 1 = 2$ (Option C). If they make the common double-negative error on the middle term and calculate $1 - 2 + 1$, they get $0$ (Option D). Option A ($-2$) typically comes from a total breakdown of the order of operations or sign rules (e.g., $-1 - 2 + 1 = -2$).

Advanced students handle the bracket $(-1)^2$ correctly. Proficient students usually get it right but are susceptible to the "sign trap" if they work too quickly. Basic students are highly likely to treat $(-1)^2$ as $-1$.
