This question tests a fundamental understanding of solving one-step equations using inverse operations. Specifically, it assesses whether a student recognises that the inverse of "subtracting 7" is "adding 7."

In the UK curriculum, students at the **below_basic** level often struggle with the directional nature of inverse operations. The most common error is seeing the minus sign in $x - 7$ and assuming they should perform another subtraction (Option D) to "move" the 7. Some may also associate the $7$ with multiplication (Option B) if they confuse the layout with coefficient notation (e.g., $7x$).

Students at the **basic** level generally understand that an operation is needed to isolate $x$, but a significant minority still default to the original sign shown in the expression (Option D). However, because the change from $x-7$ to $x$ is such a standard introductory example, many will correctly identify addition.

For **proficient** and **advanced** students, this is a "surface-level" question. They have internalised the balance method, and the absence of a right-hand side doesn't confuse them because they are focusing on the relationship between $-7$ and the empty $x$ term below it.

below_basic: A=55% B=15% C=5% D=25%
basic: A=80% B=5% C=2% D=13%
proficient: A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%
advanced: A=99% B=0% C=0% D=1%
