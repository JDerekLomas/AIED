As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question on adding algebraic fractions. The main hurdles here are finding a common denominator (which is $2x$) and remembering to adjust the numerator of the second fraction.

**Option A ($11/2x$)** is the correct answer. Students must multiply the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 2 to get $8/2x$, then add: $3 + 8 = 11$.

**Option B ($7/3x$)** is a common lower-ability error where students add "across" the top ($3+4=7$) and the bottom ($2x+x=3x$).

**Option C ($11/x$)** is a "halfway" error where the student correctly identifies the need to double the 4, but fails to keep the correct common denominator of $2x$.

**Option D ($7/2x$)** is a very common "trap" for mid-ability students. They correctly identify $2x$ as the common denominator but forget to change the numerator of the second fraction, simply adding $3+4=7$.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=45% C=5% D=25%
basic: A=35% B=20% C=5% D=40%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%
