This quadratic expansion question tests the ability to manage signs, specifically the interaction between two negative constants. While many students are familiar with the "FOIL" or grid method, the specific challenge here is the double negative for the middle term (-3 - 2 = -5) and the constant term (-3 × -2 = +6).

Option B is a common trap for students who find the difference between 3 and 2 rather than the sum. Option C is a trap for students who forget that two negatives make a positive when multiplying, but also wrongly apply that logic to the addition. Option D is the most frequent error for "proficient" students who correctly calculate the -5m but fail the sign rule for the constant (-3 × -2).

Because this is a standard "double negative" expansion, it is considered a medium-difficulty question for foundation/basic tiers but straightforward for higher tiers.
