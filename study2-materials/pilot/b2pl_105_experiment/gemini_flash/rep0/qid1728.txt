To predict the performance on this question, we must look at the interaction between BIDMAS/Order of Operations and fraction arithmetic.

This is a classic "trap" question. The most common error is for students to work from left to right, performing the subtraction before the multiplication. 
*   **Left-to-right error:** $\frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$. Then $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{10}$ (Option B).
*   **Correct method:** $\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{20}$. Then $\frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{20} = \frac{15}{20} - \frac{1}{20} = \frac{14}{20} = \frac{7}{10}$ (Option C).

The numbers $3/4$ and $1/4$ are "friendly" together, which strongly encourages the left-to-right misconception. Option A ($2/16$) represents a combination of the left-to-right error and the common mistake of subtracting denominators ($3-1=2$, $4-4=16$ or similar erratic logic).
