This question is a classic test of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) combined with a decimal/fraction conversion. It is significantly more difficult than it looks because students have two distinct "exit ramps" for errors.

The most common trap is performing the subtraction before the multiplication ($0.4 - 0.2 = 0.2$; $0.2 \times 3 = 0.6$). Another frequent error is incorrectly converting $1/5$ to $0.5$ (the "digit matching" misconception), though here that error leads to $0.4 - 1.5 = -1.1$, which is not an option, forcing many students to guess or recalculate. 

Option A (0.2) is the result of applying BIDMAS correctly ($1/5 \times 3 = 0.6$; $0.4 - 0.6 = -0.2$) but making a sign error or simply doing $0.6 - 0.4$. Option B (0.6) is the "left-to-right" error. Option D (0.06) is a place-value slip during multiplication.

The negative result ($C$) is the primary hurdle; even students who know BIDMAS often struggle when the second term is larger than the first in a subtraction.
