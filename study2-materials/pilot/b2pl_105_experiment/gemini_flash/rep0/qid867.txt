This question addresses one of the most persistent misconceptions in GCSE mathematics: the "freshman's dream," where students square the individual terms within the parentheses rather than expanding the brackets fully.

**Analysis:**
*   **The Trap (Options B and C):** A significant number of students at below_basic and basic levels will simply square $x$ and square $-4$. Depending on how they handle the negative (either $(-4)^2 = 16$ or keeping the sign from the middle), they will gravitate toward B or C.
*   **The Negative Sign (Option D):** This catches students who know they need the middle term (from $x^2 - 4x - 4x$) but incorrectly calculate $(-4) \times (-4)$ as $-16$.
*   **Difficulty:** This is a "classic" distractor question. While it looks simple, the mistake in Option B is so intuitive to low-attaining students that it often outscores the correct answer in those cohorts.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=25% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=82% B=8% C=4% D=6%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
