In this question, students are being asked to link a visual representation (cups and counters) to an algebraic process. The diagrams clearly show the "take away" method (subtracting $x$ from both sides, then subtracting 2 from both sides).

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **A is the correct response.** It shows the correct initial equation and the final solution ($x=2$) derived from the steps shown in the image.
*   **D is the most common pitfall.** This reflects the "combination" error where students see $x$ and 4 and simply add them to get $3x$ (or $5x$, though $3x$ is offered here) rather than maintaining the equation's structure. It also combines the 4 and 2 to get 6.
*   **C** is a variation of the combination error, keeping the $=2$ on the right.
*   **B** is for students who try to skip the algebra entirely but make an arithmetic slip or don't understand how to translate the visual.

The visual nature of the "cups" usually helps mid-to-high ability students, but lower-ability students often ignore the diagrams and try to perform "magic" with the numbers they see in the text, leading them to select C or D.
