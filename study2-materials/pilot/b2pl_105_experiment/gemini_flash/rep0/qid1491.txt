This question is a classic "sign vs. magnitude" trap. While the calculation of $2^4$ is relatively straightforward for most students (though some will still default to $2 \times 4$), the primary difficulty lies in the interaction between the negative sign, the brackets, and the even exponent.

In UK classrooms, students are taught that the brackets mean "multiply the whole of $-2$ by itself four times." However, many students have a "surface-level" rule in their heads that "negative powers/numbers stay negative" or they confuse this with the calculator logic where $-2^4$ (without brackets) equals $-16$.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **C (16):** The correct answer. Requires knowing $2^4=16$ and that an even number of negatives results in a positive.
*   **A (-16):** The most common "high-level" error. Students calculate $2^4$ correctly but assume the negative sign persists.
*   **B (-8):** A "low-level" error. The student multiplies the base by the exponent ($2 \times 4$) and keeps the sign.
*   **D (8):** The student multiplies the base by the exponent and ignores the sign.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=35% B=20% C=35% D=10%
proficient: A=30% B=5% C=60% D=5%
advanced: A=10% B=0% C=90% D=0%
