This question tests the expansion of a single bracket where the term outside is negative and the second term inside is also negative. This "double negative" ($-5 \times -7$) is a classic separator in UK secondary schools (typically KS3 and GCSE).

While the $-5m$ part is generally handled well, the sign of the constant term is where the majority of errors occur.

**Analysis of the Options:**
- **A ($5m + 35$):** Students ignore the negative sign on the 5 entirely but manage the double negative logic (or simply see two minuses and think "plus").
- **B ($-5m - 35$):** The most common "partial" success. Students correctly multiply $-5 \times m$, but fail to apply the negative multiplier to the second term, simply bringing the minus sign down from inside the bracket.
- **C ($-5m + 35$):** The correct answer. Requires two distinct steps of sign management.
- **D ($5m - 35$):** A rarer error where students might divide or lose signs haphazardly.

**Predicted Performance:**

**below_basic:** A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%
*At this level, students often see a minus sign in the bracket and assume the answer must have a minus sign. They frequently pick B because it "looks" like the original terms but with a 5 attached.*

**basic:** A=15% B=45% C=30% D=10%
*Students at this level understand they need to multiply 5 by $m$ and 7, but they consistently struggle with the directed number rules. B remains the most attractive distractor as they fail to distribute the negative sign to the second term.*

**proficient:** A=5% B=20% C=70% D=5%
*These students are mostly fluent with brackets. Most will remember "negative times a negative is a positive," but a significant minority will still make a "slips" error, leading them to B under exam pressure.*

**advanced:** A=1% B=4% C=94% D=1%
*Advanced students (targeting Grade 7-9) have internalised the distributive law with negative numbers. Errors here are rare and usually down to extreme haste rather than lack of knowledge.*
