As an experienced UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as a test of BIDMAS/order of operations within an algebraic context. 

The structure \(3 + ab\) is relatively straightforward, but it poses a challenge for students who read mathematics left-to-right rather than following operator precedence. 
- **Option B** is a common error for students who see three variables/numbers and assume they are all being summed (ignoring the implicit multiplication between \(a\) and \(b\)).
- **Option C** is the most significant "trap" for students with "left-to-right" bias, as they read "3 + a" first and then attach the "b" as a multiplier.
- **Option D** is a variation of that same left-to-right error but focused on the second term.

Because the addition comes before the multiplication in the written expression, "Basic" level students often fail to prioritise the product \(ab\). However, "Proficient" students usually recognise that \(ab\) is a single term.

Here is my prediction of the performance distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=35% D=15%
basic: A=50% B=10% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=96% B=1% C=2% D=1%
