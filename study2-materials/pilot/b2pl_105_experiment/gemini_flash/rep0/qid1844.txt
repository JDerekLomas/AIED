As an experienced teacher, I have evaluated this specific question on quadratic functions. 

**Analysis of the question:**
1.  **The Goal:** Students must find the y-intercept. This requires setting $x=0$.
2.  **The "Trap" (Option B):** This is the most significant distractor. Students often confuse y-intercepts with x-intercepts (roots). Even though Option B is written as coordinates on the y-axis, many students see the 8 and 6 and gravitate towards them because they appear in the brackets.
3.  **The "Trap" (Option A):** This catches students who mistakenly add the numbers in the brackets $(-8-6=-14)$ instead of multiplying them.
4.  **The Sign Trap (Option D):** This catches students who know to multiply $(-8 \times -6)$ but make an integer sign error, resulting in $-48$.

In a real classroom, the confusion between "roots" and "y-intercepts" is the most prevalent error at the lower and middle tiers. Students see a factored quadratic and their brain immediately goes to "change the sign, find the roots."
