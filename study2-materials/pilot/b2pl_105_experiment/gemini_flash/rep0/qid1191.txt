In this linear equation, the unknown appears on both sides. While the algebra is standard, students at lower ability levels often struggle with the "balance" method, frequently performing the wrong operation when moving terms across the equals sign (e.g., subtracting $5$ from both sides instead of adding it, or subtracting $20t$ from $5t$ and ignoring the sign).

$t=1$ (Option B) is the correct answer. The most common distractors for this specific equation are:
- **Option A ($t=0$):** Chosen by students who try to "cancel out" terms or simply guess when they cannot isolate the variable.
- **Option C ($t=-1$):** A sign error when moving the 5 or the 5t (e.g., $15t = -15$).
- **Option D ($t=1/5$):** This occurs if a student correctly gets $15t = 15$ but then performs $15 \div 15$ incorrectly or, more likely, subtracts/adds coefficients in a way that leads to $15 = 3t$ or similar. However, $1/5$ is also a "safe-looking" fractional answer that catches students who are used to equations being difficult.

In this specific case, the numbers are "friendly." $20-5=15$ and $10+5=15$, leading to $15t=15$. This simplicity actually helps most proficient students avoid the traps, while basic students still struggle with the initial rearrangement.
