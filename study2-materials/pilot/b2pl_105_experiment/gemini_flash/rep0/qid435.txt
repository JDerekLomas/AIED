As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on how students handle negative numbers and BIDMAS (order of operations).

**Analysis:**
- **Option A:** $2 \times (-2) - (-4) \times 4 = -4 - (-16) = -4 + 16 = 12$. This tests the double negative, but the result is positive.
- **Option B (Correct):** $-28 - (-4) \times 2 = -28 - (-8) = -28 + 8 = -20$. This is the "trap" area. Students often subtract $-4$ from $-28$ first to get $-24$, or miscalculate $-28 + 8$ as $-36$.
- **Option C:** $(-5)^2 + 5 = 25 + 5 = 30$. A very common mistake here is thinking $(-5)^2$ is $-25$, which would give $-25 + 5 = -20$. This is the strongest distractor for proficient students.
- **Option D:** $(-42) \div (-2) + 1 = 21 + 1 = 22$. Students struggling with division of negatives might see $-21 + 1 = -20$, making this a distractor for those who forget that a negative divided by a negative is a positive.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
(Below basic students often guess or perform operations from left-to-right regardless of BIDMAS. Many will be drawn to C or D because they "see" the numbers 20 or 25.)

basic: A=15% B=35% C=35% D=15%
(Basic students understand some negative rules but frequently believe $(-5)^2$ is $-25$. Option C is a massive "safe haven" for this group.)

proficient: A=10% B=55% C=25% D=10%
(Proficient students usually handle the BIDMAS in B correctly but may still fall for the squaring trap in C if they are working quickly.)

advanced: A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%
(Advanced students will systematically check the operations. The only errors here are usually slips in basic mental arithmetic under time pressure.)
