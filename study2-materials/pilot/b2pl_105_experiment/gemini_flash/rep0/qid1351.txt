This question is a classic test of directed number arithmetic within an algebraic context. While the algebra itself is a one-step subtraction ($p = -3 - 12$), the placement of the negative on the left-hand side and the transition further into the negatives are major stumbling blocks.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **Option A ($p=9$):** This is the most common error. Students see $12$ and $3$ and perform $12 - 3$, ignoring the negative sign on the 3 or assuming they should find the "difference" between the numbers regardless of signs.
*   **Option C ($p=-9$):** Students perform $-3 + 12$ instead of subtracting 12. This happens because they see the $+12$ and mistakenly believe the operation to "undo" it is already present in the $-3$.
*   **Option D ($p=15$):** A sign error where students move the 12 and change it to a plus, or simply add $12 + 3$ and ignore all negative signs.

**Student Performance Predictions:**

*   **Below Basic:** These students struggle with the concept of isolating the variable and often just combine the two visible numbers using whichever operation feels most "natural" (usually addition or simple subtraction).
*   **Basic:** These students understand they need to subtract 12 from both sides, but frequently fail the mental calculation $-3 - 12$, often arriving at $-9$ or $9$.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually handle the inverse operation correctly and are comfortable with the number line. Some may still make a "sign-flip" slip under time pressure.
*   **Advanced:** This is a routine one-step problem that they will solve mentally with very high accuracy.
