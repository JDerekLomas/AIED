This is a classic "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS) question. Despite its simplicity, it remains one of the most reliable diagnostic questions for identifying whether a student understands priority of operations or simply processes calculations from left to right.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **The Trap (A):** The most common error is performing $5 + 4$ first to get $9$, then $9 \times 3 = 27$. This is the "default" linear processing mode for students who have not mastered BIDMAS.
*   **The Correct Path (B):** Multiplying $4 \times 3 = 12$ first, then adding $5$.
*   **The Distractors (C and D):** $C (60)$ comes from $(5+4+3) \times 5$ or similar messy arithmetic, and $D (12)$ is simply the product of the last two numbers. These are rarely chosen compared to the "linear" error.

In the UK curriculum, "below basic" students often default to left-to-right calculation. "Basic" students know the acronym BIDMAS but often forget to apply it when the addition comes first. "Proficient" students get this right consistently, and "Advanced" students see this as trivial.

below_basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=45% B=50% C=3% D=2%
proficient: A=10% B=88% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=1% D=0%
