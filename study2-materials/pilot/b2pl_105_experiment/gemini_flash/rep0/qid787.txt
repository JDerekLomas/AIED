In this question, students are testing their understanding of the additive property of equality and directed numbers. 

Jo's step involves subtracting 3 from both sides: $-5 - 3 = -8$, which is a common error (they should have added 3 to cancel the $-3$, or if they did subtract 3, the RHS would be $-6$). 
Paul's step involves adding 5 to both sides: $-3 + 5 = 2$, but Paul has written $-3 + 5 = -8$.

This is a classic "trapping" question because both students have made the same sign error (combining the absolute values instead of considering the signs). Many lower-ability students will see the numbers 5 and 3 and assume "8" is correct regardless of the sign. They often believe that in algebra "you just move the number to the other side and combine them," without rigorous attention to the inverse operation.

**Comparison of Options:**
- **D (Correct):** Neither is correct because Jo's math results in $-8$ instead of $-2$ (or simply being the wrong operation), and Paul's results in $-8$ instead of $+2$.
- **C:** Highly attractive to those who see the "8" and assume both are just different ways of moving constants.
- **A & B:** Chosen by students who perhaps perform one calculation correctly but fail the other, or who have a bias toward one side of the equation.
