As an experienced UK maths teacher, I identify this question as a classic "two-step" fraction problem. While the addition itself is straightforward because the denominators are common, the instruction **"Write your answer in its simplest form"** is the primary discriminator.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A ($8/20$):** This attracts students with the "add across" misconception (adding both numerators and denominators). This is common at lower ability levels.
*   **B ($8/10$):** This is the correct sum but *not* in simplest form. This is the biggest "trap" for basic and proficient students who stop after the first step.
*   **C ($4/5$):** The correct, fully simplified answer.
*   **D ($4/10$):** A distractor likely chosen by students who try to simplify $8/20$ incorrectly or perform a different operation.

**Ability Level Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often lack the procedural knowledge of common denominators, leading many to add both top and bottom (Option A).
*   **Basic:** Usually know to keep the denominator the same, but frequently miss the instruction to simplify, landing on Option B.
*   **Proficient:** Very comfortable with addition, but under exam pressure, a significant minority will forget the final simplification step or make a minor arithmetic error.
*   **Advanced:** Rarely miss the simplification instruction; however, some may overthink it or make a slip.

below_basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=25% C=68% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=4% C=94% D=1%
