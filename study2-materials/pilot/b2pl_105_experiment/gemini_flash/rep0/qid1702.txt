To answer this question, we must look at how students handle a linear equation that is not in the form $y=mx+c$ and requires substituting for $y$ rather than $x$.

**Analysis:**
1.  **The Substitution:** Students must replace $y$ with $0.5$. The calculation is $10x - 6(0.5) = 30$, leading to $10x - 3 = 30$.
2.  **Common Errors:**
    *   **The Add/Subtract Slip:** A very common error is to subtract 3 from 30 instead of adding it ($10x = 27$ instead of $10x = 33$). This leads to **Option D (2.7)**. 
    *   **Substitution Swap:** Students often assume the top row is the input and the bottom row is the output. They might substitute $x = 0.5$ instead of $y = 0.5$. $10(0.5) - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow 5 - 6y = 30 \Rightarrow -6y = 25 \Rightarrow y \approx -4.16$. While not an exact match, it often leads to guesses around Option B.
    *   **The "Sign" Trap:** In the equation $10x - 3 = 30$, some students get confused by the negative $6y$ and end up with $10x + 3 = 30$ by accident, or mismanage the division. Option C is the correct answer ($33 \div 10 = 3.3$).

Option D is a powerful distractor because the "3" resulting from $6 \times 0.5$ is often subtracted from 30 by students who are rushing or have weak inverse-operation skills.
