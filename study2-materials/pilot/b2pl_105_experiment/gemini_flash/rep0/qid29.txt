This question tests the ability to solve a linear inequality where the variable appears on both sides. The key challenges here are:
1.  **Variable Management:** Choosing whether to move the $n$ terms to the left or right. Moving them to the left results in a negative coefficient ($-n \leq -10$), which requires the student to remember to flip the inequality sign when dividing by -1. 
2.  **Arithmetic Errors:** The transition from $3$ and $-7$ to $10$ is relatively straightforward, but students often make sign errors (e.g., $3 - 7 = -4$ or $7 - 3 = 4$).
3.  **The "Variable on Right" Trap:** Many students correctly arrive at $10 \leq n$ but then intuitively write $n \leq 10$ because they are used to the variable being on the left and do not realise that the relationship direction must be preserved.

**A) $2 \leq n$:** Result of poor arithmetic (e.g., $7 - 3 = 4$, then $4 \div 2$).
**B) $10 \leq n$:** The correct answer.
**C) $n \leq 10$:** The most common distractor, caused either by not flipping the sign when dividing by $-1$, or by reading $10 \leq n$ and incorrectly rewriting it with $n$ first.
**D) $-4 \leq n$:** Result of $3 - 7 = -4$.
