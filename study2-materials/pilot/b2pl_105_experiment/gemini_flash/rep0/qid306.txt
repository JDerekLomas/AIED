This question addresses two distinct aspects of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS): the left-to-right rule for addition and subtraction, and the priority of multiplication over addition.

In **Problem P**, the "addition comes before subtraction" misconception is extremely common. Many students believe they must do $5+6$ first because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, leading them to choose Option D or C. Even proficient students often fall into this trap if they haven't been taught that addition and subtraction have equal priority.

In **Problem Q**, the priority of multiplication ($5 \times 6$) is more widely understood among basic-to-advanced students, but below-basic students frequently calculate from left-to-right regardless of operators, leading them to $4+5$.

The combination of these two specific traps makes **Option B** the correct answer, but **Option D** is the most "attractive" wrong answer for those who follow the acronym BIDMAS literally without understanding priority levels.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=15% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=55% C=5% D=35%
advanced: A=2% B=85% C=3% D=10%
