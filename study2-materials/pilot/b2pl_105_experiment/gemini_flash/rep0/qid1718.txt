This specific question targets one of the most persistent misconceptions in GCSE Mathematics: the "freshman's dream," where students square the individual terms rather than expanding the brackets. 

The primary difficulty here is the sign of the constant term. Students often correctly identify that they need a "$-6x$" middle term but struggle with whether $(-3) \times (-3)$ results in $+9$ or $-9$. Option B is the classic "omission of the middle term" error, while Option A catches those who expand fully but fail the integer multiplication rules for negative numbers.

Here is the predicted distribution of answers based on typical UK secondary school data:

below_basic: A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=1% D=95%
