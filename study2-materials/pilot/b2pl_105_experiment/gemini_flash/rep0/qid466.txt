This question specifically tests the understanding of the **multiplicative inverse (reciprocal)** combined with **directed numbers (negative signs)**. 

The primary trap here is the sign. Many students remember that to get "1", they must flip the fraction, leading them to $\frac{4}{3}$. However, because the target is $-1$ and the first term is already negative, they must multiply by a **positive** number. 

*   **Below Basic** students often guess or focus on the digits rather than the operation. Many will choose **D** simply because they see the same number, or **C** because they ignore the "flip" required to get 1 and just think about changing the sign.
*   **Basic** students usually know the fraction needs to flip to get a "1" of some sort, but they often struggle with the double negative. Many will follow the "rule" that a negative times a negative is a positive, and since they see a negative sign in the question and a negative sign in the answer, they erroneously pick **B** to "keep everything negative."
*   **Proficient** students understand the reciprocal property well. A small number will still fall for the sign trap if they are working too quickly, but most will realize that $(-) \times (+) = (-)$.
*   **Advanced** students will solve this mentally almost instantly and are unlikely to be tripped up by the signs.
