This question specifically tests the distribution of a negative sign across a binomial, which is a classic "sign error" trap in secondary mathematics.

The main difficulty lies in the second term. Students often remember to negate the first term ($2$ becomes $-2$) but frequently "drop" the second negative or fail to apply the "negative times a negative equals a positive" rule to the $-3p$. 

**Option B** is the most common distractor, representing the mistake of only applying the negative sign to the first term. **Option A** is chosen by students who ignore the outside sign entirely. **Option C** is a rare error where students think the negative only applies to the middle operator, or they lose the negative on the $2$ while trying to fix the $3p$.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=45% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=50% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=2% B=23% C=2% D=73%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
