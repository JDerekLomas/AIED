This question primarily tests two things: knowledge of times tables and the rules for multiplying signed numbers (negative $\times$ positive = negative; negative $\times$ negative = positive).

**Analysis:**
1.  **A (-3 and -8):** This is the "classic" trap. Students often know $3 \times 8 = 24$, but many hold the misconception that "a negative and a negative make a negative" (confusing it with addition) or simply see two negatives and assume the result must be negative.
2.  **B (-4 and 6):** The correct answer.
3.  **C (-10 and -14):** A distractor for students who confuse "product" with "sum." $-10 + -14 = -24$. Lower-ability students frequently mix up mathematical vocabulary.
4.  **D (-3 and 9):** A "near miss" for students with weak times table fluency who might associate 3 and 9 with numbers in the 20s (27).

The specific difficulty here lies in the "double negative" misconception in Option A. Many students at the "basic" level can perform the multiplication but fail the sign rule.

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=40% B=45% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=15% B=82% C=2% D=1%
advanced: A=2% B=98% C=0% D=0%
