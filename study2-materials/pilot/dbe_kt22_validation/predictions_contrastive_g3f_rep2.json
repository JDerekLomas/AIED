    "raw": "In an introductory database course, this question serves as a foundational definition check. The core difficulty lies in the terminology used to bridge discrete mathematics and database theory.\n\n\"Set\" is the mathematical definition for a collection of distinct elements. However, struggling students often conflate \"Set\" with \"Relation\" because the Relational Model is built on set theory, and \"Tuple\" is a term they recently learned and often apply incorrectly to any fundamental structural definition. \n\nAverage students may overthink the question, wondering if the instructor is asking for the specific database term (\"Relation\") rather than the underlying mathematical term. Advanced students recognize this as a verbatim definition from the mathematical foundations chapter of any standard textbook (like Silberschatz or Ramakrishnan).\n\nstruggling: A=20% B=5% C=55% D=20%\naverage: A=10% B=2% C=80% D=8%\ngood: A=5% B=0% C=93% D=2%\nadvanced: A=1% B=0% C=99% D=0%",
