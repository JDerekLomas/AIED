They likely calculated `3\u00d72=6` first (correctly, without changing order), then incorrectly thought adding brackets around `(4-5)` would significantly alter the total toward 13.  \n\n**Option C (3 \u00d7 (2 + 4 \u2013 5))**  \nThis simplifies to \\(3 \u00d7 (1) = 3\\).  \nThe student here has correctly grouped all the addition/subtraction first, but this yields a result too small. They have not checked carefully against the target number 13, perhaps guessing a blanket grouping without step-by-step verification.  \n\n**Option D (Does not need brackets)**  \nWithout brackets: `3\u00d72+4\u20135` = \\(6+4-5 = 5\\). Some pupils over-rely on BIDMAS left-to-right after multiplication, knowing multiplication comes before addition/subtraction, and conclude the answer without brackets is already fixed at 5; they correctly compute 5 but fail to see brackets could change it to 13. Attractive to those who don\u2019t grasp brackets can override precedence.  \n\n**Correct option A (3 \u00d7 (2 + 4) \u2013 5)**  \nThis gives `3\u00d76 \u2013 5 = 18 \u2013 5 = 13`.  \n\nTo get 13, the student must realise 18 must come first (3\u00d76), which only happens if `2+4` is grouped together before multiplying by 3, then subtract 5. The most common pitfall is neglecting that `3\u00d7(2+4)\u20135` still respects BIDMAS: brackets first, then multiplication, then subtraction.  \n\n---\n\nI estimate about **60%** of Year 9 students would answer correctly, as the question tests a fundamental BIDMAS skill but the distractors (especially C) catch those who rush and don\u2019t verify the arithmetic after placing brackets, while B and D attract those with insecure precedence understanding.  \n\n**ESTIMATE: 60**",

They might also be looking at one of the *other* angles formed where diagonal meets side instead of the vertex angles at the centre.\n\n**B)** Obtuse is tempting because, in rectangles that are not squares, two of the angles at the centre *are* obtuse and two are acute.

Students reading too quickly might just think \u201cany angle at the centre\u201d can be obtuse without checking which are being indicated.\n\n**C)** Correct. The rectangle\u2019s diagonals bisect each other but are not perpendicular unless it is a square. Hence, at the centre there are two acute and two obtuse angles (if not square), and in the case of a square they are all 90\u00b0. Since the angles highlighted are adjacent centre angles (one \u201cright side\u201d and one \u201cbottom side\u201d vertex of the centre), they must be unequal and sum to 180\u00b0, therefore they cannot *both* be 90\u00b0 unless all four centre angles are 90\u00b0 (square), but question says \"rectangle with different length sides\" \u2013 so cannot be a square. Therefore 90\u00b0 is impossible for *both* highlighted, and only one highlighted is 90\u00b0 if the other is 90\u00b0, which would require a square, hence prohibited. So it\u2019s impossible for either to be exactly 90\u00b0? Wait \u2014 actually careful: Diagonals of a non-square rectangle are not perpendicular, so each angle at centre is not 90\u00b0.

Conversely, if it doesn't intercept the \\(x\\)-axis, it certainly can\u2019t be factorised into real linear factors (with integers). So Katie\u2019s statement is correct within the curriculum framework; Tom\u2019s is false. A student might think *both are making logically equivalent statements* (confusing statement and its converse) and wrongly say both are correct.\n\n- **Option D (Neither):**  \nPerhaps arises if the student knows discriminant can be negative (no intercepts) but doesn\u2019t register factorisation is irrelevant to whether it *does* intercept, thinking:  \n\u2022 Tom wrong because not factorisable could still cross axis (correct)  \n\u2022 Katie wrong because \u201cnot intercepting \u21d2 cannot factorise\u201d \u2013 but actually it\u2019s true in real numbers; maybe they\u2019re confusing with \u201cfactorisable into integers\u201d vs. \u201calways factorisable in principle (complete the square etc.)\u201d? Might misinterpret Katie's statement as \"cannot be factorised at all in any sense\", but in GCSE terms it\u2019s correct.  \n\nKatie\u2019s statement works in the UK Year 9 scope: If graph doesn\u2019t intercept \\(x\\)-axis \u21d2 no real roots \u21d2 cannot factorise into real linear factors (so indeed \u201ccannot be factorised\u201d as far as they know).\n\nThus only Katie is correct.",

If they mistakenly take the x-coordinate at y=20 as about 20 kg (but slope shows ~0.45 kg per lb), they're thinking \u201cabout the same number\u201d (confusing kg with lb due to not noticing the axis labels carefully). It\u2019s an attractive mistake because numbers look \u201csymmetric\u201d on the graph.  \n\n**C) 44 kilograms** \u2013 This comes from reversing the conversion in the wrong direction: thinking \u201c20 kg = how many pounds?\u201d and estimating ~44 lb from the graph (which is close to the true conversion), then incorrectly applying that to the question as if it were \u201c20 pounds in kg\u201d. This is a very common misreading of what\u2019s being asked.  \n\n**D) 50 kilograms** \u2013 Possibly misreading the scale, or rounding a found conversion factor wrongly: if they noticed ~2.2 lb per kg but inverted it incorrectly (20 lb \u00d7 2.2 \u2248 44 lb then take that as kg? That\u2019s C) but D is slightly higher \u2014 perhaps they took 20 lb \u00d7 2.5 = 50). Alternatively, could stem from looking at where the line passes through roughly (25,55) and incorrectly estimating slope as \u201cdivide pounds by 1.something\u201d, but messing up units.  \n\n**A) 9 kilograms** \u2013 Correct reading: from y-axis (pounds) = 20, follow horizontally to line, then down to x-axis (kilograms) gives a value close to 9. Students who check the conversion sense know 1 kg \u2248 2.2 lb, so 20 lb should be < 10 kg.  \n\n**Proportion getting correct:** Many Year 9 students will rush graph reading or confuse axes, especially with lb/kg not in daily use for some.

They might think both are wrong except Tom's, because they incorrectly solve \\(-2m > 12\\) as \\(m > -6\\) and consider that valid, and \\(-2 + m > 12\\) as \\(m > 14\\) but possibly misread which inequality was being checked.  \n- **Option C (Both correct):** Students think the rules are always the same regardless of adding vs. multiplying by a negative; they just solved \\(-2m > 12\\) by dividing by \\(-2\\) without flipping the sign.  \n- **Option D (Neither correct):** They might flip the inequality in Katie's case erroneously after subtracting/adding, or they could think adding isn't allowed but also Tom got the flip wrong.  \n\n**Attractive traps:**  \n- Forgetting to flip the inequality when dividing by a negative is a very common mistake. This means many students will say Tom\u2019s method is fine because it \u201clooks\u201d like normal solving \u2014 this makes **A** or **C** tempting.  \n- Katie\u2019s solution is actually correct, so any student who memorised \u201cflip when multiply/divide by negative\u201d but not fully confident will check Tom\u2019s: see he didn\u2019t flip, mark it wrong; check Katie\u2019s: seems right. This yields **B**.  \n- Students not solid on algebra may pick **D** if they misapply \u201cdo the same to both sides\u201d or misinterpret the expressions (e.g. reading \\(-2+m\\) as \\(-2m\\)).  \n\n**Who would catch themselves?**  \nStudents comfortable with manipulating inequalities will spot Tom\u2019s mistake quickly and recognise Katie\u2019s simple rearrangement. Students weaker in algebra will often rush and equate solving methods across addition and multiplication.  \n\nGiven this is Year 9 near the end of the topic, many will still slip on Tom\u2019s part because the \"flip\" rule is easily forgotten in a quick exam question. But the question format asks \u201cwho is correct,\u201d prompting them to check each carefully. I\u2019d expect around **65%** to answer correctly because Katie\u2019s is obvious to most, but the trap in Tom\u2019s statement is deliberately testing a key, commonly-misapplied rule.  \n\nESTIMATE",

So they\u2019d wrongly think Tom\u2019s \\(\\frac{18\\times 180}{20}\\) is the only interior-angle formula.  \n\n**Option B (Only Katie)** \u2013 Some know the standard formula interior angle \\(=180 - \\frac{360}{n}\\), but think Tom\u2019s method is wrong because they don\u2019t recognise \\(\\frac{(n-2)\\times 180}{n}\\) rewritten as \\(\\frac{18 \\times 180}{20}\\) for \\(n=20\\) is the same thing.  \n\n**Option D (Neither correct)** \u2013 This could come from misremembering both formulae, e.g., thinking \\(\\frac{n-2}{n}\\times 180\\) uses \\(n\\) not \\(n-2\\), or mixing up when to divide by \\(n\\).  \n\n**\"Attractive\" errors:**  \nOption B might feel natural if students *only* remember Katie\u2019s approach from recent lessons; they may think Tom\u2019s method seems strange because \\(18 \\times 180\\) looks unrelated without factoring in \\(n-2\\).  \n\nStudents more familiar with deriving interior angle from polygon angle sum \\((n-2)\\times 180^\\circ\\) divided by \\(n\\) might recognise both forms and not be tricked. Year 9 students vary in confidence with rearranging formulas \u2013 weaker students may not realise these are equivalent.  \n\nGiven typical UK Year 9 exposure to interior/exterior angles:  \n- Many know Katie\u2019s method because \u201cexterior angles sum to 360\u201d is heavily emphasized.  \n- The stronger ones also know Tom\u2019s formula.  \n- The equivalence is not automatic for all, so I\u2019d expect a significant portion would mistakenly pick only Katie, and some pick only Tom.  \n\nConsidering the need to check both: I'd estimate around **60%** would choose the correct answer C.  \n\nESTIMATE: 60",

Each interval = (2 \u2013 (\u201310))/6 = 12/6 = 2. Bottom dash = \u201310, next up = \u20138, then \u20136, \u20134, \u20132, 0, 2. Middle dash (4th of 7 dashes) = \u20134. But a quick glance leads many to think interval = 2 units and middle = \u20132 or \u20131 if they mis-locate the counting start.\n\nThe majority of capable Year 9s should get this correct, but the \u201310 to 2 range across 6 equal intervals on a *7 dash* line is a known source of diagram-reading error for weaker students.\n\n**ESTIMATE: 65**",

For example, if step size = 2 marks between points, each mark = 2 units, then 4 marks above \u22128 is \u22128 + 8 = 0; but if they say \u201cbelow the top by 2 marks\u201d, they may mistakenly do 4 \u2212 4 = 0 OR in the wrong step: 4 \u2212 8 = \u22124. Mixing \u201cabove bottom\u201d with \u201cbelow top\u201d logic incorrectly could give \u22124.\n\n---\n\n**Likely correct answer prevalence:**\n\nThis question requires understanding that equal spacing means dividing the numerical range by the number of intervals (6 intervals here between \u22128 and 4, range 12 \u2192 each interval = 2 units). Many Year 9 pupils might skip the scale calculation entirely and go with visual \"two marks below 4\" \u2192 2 (option B).\n\nGiven this is a multiple-choice, that tempting wrong answer (B) will capture many. In a mixed-ability Year 9 class, probably more than half could calculate correctly if careful, but in an exam, speed and pressure lead to easy visual traps.  \nExperience suggests a weaker class might see success rate ~40%, a typical mixed class maybe 50\u201360%. I\u2019ll adjust downward to reflect that mock exams often catch pupils rushing.\n\nESTIMATE: 55",

Alternatively, they may wrongly believe parallel lines must intersect the \\(y\\)-axis at different points, eliminating Katie\u2019s pair.  \n- **Option C (Both Tom and Katie)** \u2013 The student doesn't recall that parallel means equal gradients, so they think any pair where the number before \\(x\\) is \"similar\" (2 and 3 both small?) counts as parallel, or they simply check whether the constants differ and assume both pairs are parallel because they \"don't look like they\u2019ll meet\" without calculating gradients properly.  \n- **Option D (Neither is correct)** \u2013 Student might misapply the idea that parallel lines must have identical equations, or they mistakenly think \\(y = 2x + 3\\) and \\(y = 2x - 3\\) are the same line (overlooking different intercepts) and thus \"not parallel\" because they think parallel lines cannot have different intercepts. A less common confusion could be swapping gradient comparison for intercept comparison entirely.  \n\n**Attractiveness:**  \n- Option A is relatively attractive because Tom\u2019s lines differ in both gradient and intercept, so a student hastily checking intercepts instead of gradients might think he\u2019s wrong (correct) but then wrongly dismiss Katie\u2019s by demanding same intercept.  \n- Option C is *most* attractive for those who haven\u2019t mastered gradient: they may recall that parallel lines \u201cnever meet,\u201d glance at Tom\u2019s pair (slopes 2 and 3) and believe they still won\u2019t meet because 2 and 3 are close, while clearly Katie\u2019s are parallel \u2013 so they pick both right.  \n\n**Year 9 performance:**  \nThis is near the start of learning linear graphs; many can recall \u201cparallel = same gradient\u201d when prompted directly in a lesson, but in a multi-choice setting, time pressure and miscalculation of gradients (e.g., misreading \\(y = 3x + 2\\) as \\(y = 2x + 3\\)) cause errors.  \n\nGiven its straightforwardness and typical classroom focus on gradient for parallelism, I\u2019d expect a majority to get it right in a mock",

Could cause trouble if a student mistakenly calculates \"\u22122 is less than 2\" wrongly (rare).  \n\n**Main trap**: Year 9 students may quickly look for \\( d < h \\) (strictly less) rather than allowing equality, but all except C fail even the \u201cless than\u201d test and the \u201cequal\u201d test\u2014so only C violates both. Likely errors:  \n1. Reading \"does not fit\" too quickly \u2014 thinking all except one **do** fit, but carelessly marking B because h is bigger, but B actually fits.  \n2. Mis-comparing negative vs. positive: thinking 2 \u2264 -4 must be true because -4 is further left on the number line \u2014 yes, but \u201c\u2264\u201d requires leftmost = smaller, so here 2 is actually to the right of -4, so 2 is greater than -4. Therefore false.  \n\nThis is primarily testing understanding of negative numbers and inequalities; relatively straightforward if careful, but common Year 9 errors from scanning negatives or misinterpreting \u201cdoes not fit\u201d.  \n\nGiven typical classroom performance on ordering negatives and inequality interpretation, I\u2019d estimate about **65%** answer",

Actually subtracting Pair 1 would give 2p\u22124q\u2212 (7p+4q) \u2192 \u20135p \u20138q, not eliminating q. This option is a mismatched guess without checking signs.  \n- **Option D (Subtract both)** \u2013 Here they might try to \u201cdo the same to both pairs,\u201d applying subtraction uniformly, but for Pair 1 subtraction makes q terms combine to \u20138q (not zero), so cancellation fails. Error is blindly repeating the same operation without adjusting for coefficient signs.  \n\n**Attractiveness of traps:**  \nOption B and D might seem neat and systematic (add for both or subtract for both) rather than the mixed strategy in A. Less careful students do not test each pair's combination in their head; they look for a rule like \u201cif same sign, subtract\u201d which actually applies to variables with equal coefficients and matching signs\u2014misapplied here when signs match in Pair 2 (\u2013 and \u2013).  \n\nWhich students catch themselves vs. fall into the trap? Careful ones check actual sum or difference: for Pair 1, (+4q) + (\u20134q) cancels on addition, so correct. For Pair 2, (\u20134q) \u2013 (\u20134q) cancels on subtraction. If hastily read, Pair 2 can look like both are \u201c\u20134q\u201d so adding seems to make \u20138q not zero.  \n\n**Estimated difficulty:** Quite straightforward if methodically tested, but Year 9 under time pressure often misgeneralize \"elimination steps\" without testing.  \n\n**ESTIMATE:** 65%",

Katie\u2019s parallelogram only has equal opposite sides, not equal angles unless it\u2019s a square/rhombus with equal angles, but it's drawn as a generic parallelogram here. A student choosing B has accepted \u201cparallelogram\u201d as regular but not checked the angles condition.  \n\n- **Option C (Both)** \u2013 The trap is thinking: \"Tom\u2019s triangle looks equilateral, Katie\u2019s parallelogram looks like all sides marked equal (maybe thinking rhombus) \u2192 both regular.\" But the diagram for Katie, though showing 2 pairs of parallel sides, doesn\u2019t indicate all sides equal *and* all angles equal; in fact a parallelogram generally isn\u2019t equiangular. Students visualising a \u201csquare\u201d parallelogram, or misreading the notation, might fall into this.\n\n- **Option D (Neither)** \u2013 This could happen if students misremember definition and think *regular = all sides equal AND all angles equal AND something extra* (e.g., \u201cmust be cyclic\u201d or \u201cmust have more than 3 sides\u201d), rejecting the equilateral triangle unfairly. Or they might think both are wrong if they consider Katie\u2019s obviously not regular, but also doubt if Tom\u2019s is really regular because \u201cit\u2019s just a triangle\u201d \u2014 overly strict interpretation.\n\nThe correct answer is A because only Tom\u2019s shape is both equilateral and equiangular (the definition of regular polygon).\n\n---\n\n**\u201cAttractiveness\u201d of errors:**  \nOption C is probably the most attractive incorrect choice because:  \n1.

Young students often focus on sides being equal, not on angles, so could imagine parallelogram has been marked with tick marks indicating equal sides all round.  \n\nOption B is less common but might be chosen if they *know* triangle regular requires specific case, but misjudge parallelogram due to hearing \u201cregular quadrilateral\u201d and wrongly apply to any quadrilateral with equal sides.  \n\nOption D suggests total definition misunderstanding.  \n\n---\n\nGiven this is Year 9, the definition of regular",

Weak. Actually not convincing.

The student has missed the middle term **\u201324y** because they treat it as the difference of squares *without* noticing the expression is a square of a binomial, not a product of sum and difference. This is a very common \"quick but wrong\" shortcut.\n\n- **Option B (9y\u00b2 + 16):** Similar to A but also making a sign error: (3y)\u00b2 + (4)\u00b2, forgetting both the middle term and the sign of the constant term after squaring. Less common than A, but arises from misremembering expansions and mishandling signs.\n\n- **Option D (3y \u2013 4)(3y \u2013 4):** This is literally just restating the question without expanding or simplifying. The student may think it asks to \u201cwrite in expanded form\u201d but misunderstands \u201cexpand\u201d to mean just rewriting without calculation, or they run out of time.

In a mock, maybe 60\u201370% would expand correctly, so slightly above the middle.
