They likely calculated `3\u00d72=6` first (correctly, without changing order), then incorrectly thought adding brackets around `(4-5)` would significantly alter the total toward 13.  \n\n**Option C (3 \u00d7 (2 + 4 \u2013 5))**  \nThis simplifies to \\(3 \u00d7 (1) = 3\\).  \nThe student here has correctly grouped all the addition/subtraction first, but this yields a result too small. They have not checked carefully against the target number 13, perhaps guessing a blanket grouping without step-by-step verification.  \n\n**Option D (Does not need brackets)**  \nWithout brackets: `3\u00d72+4\u20135` = \\(6+4-5 = 5\\). Some pupils over-rely on BIDMAS left-to-right after multiplication, knowing multiplication comes before addition/subtraction, and conclude the answer without brackets is already fixed at 5; they correctly compute 5 but fail to see brackets could change it to 13. Attractive to those who don\u2019t grasp brackets can override precedence.  \n\n**Correct option A (3 \u00d7 (2 + 4) \u2013 5)**  \nThis gives `3\u00d76 \u2013 5 = 18 \u2013 5 = 13`.  \n\nTo get 13, the student must realise 18 must come first (3\u00d76), which only happens if `2+4` is grouped together before multiplying by 3, then subtract 5. The most common pitfall is neglecting that `3\u00d7(2+4)\u20135` still respects BIDMAS: brackets first, then multiplication, then subtraction.  \n\n---\n\nI estimate about **60%** of Year 9 students would answer correctly, as the question tests a fundamental BIDMAS skill but the distractors (especially C) catch those who rush and don\u2019t verify the arithmetic after placing brackets, while B and D attract those with insecure precedence understanding.  \n\n**ESTIMATE: 60**",

They might also be looking at one of the *other* angles formed where diagonal meets side instead of the vertex angles at the centre.\n\n**B)** Obtuse is tempting because, in rectangles that are not squares, two of the angles at the centre *are* obtuse and two are acute.

Students reading too quickly might just think \u201cany angle at the centre\u201d can be obtuse without checking which are being indicated.\n\n**C)** Correct. The rectangle\u2019s diagonals bisect each other but are not perpendicular unless it is a square. Hence, at the centre there are two acute and two obtuse angles (if not square), and in the case of a square they are all 90\u00b0. Since the angles highlighted are adjacent centre angles (one \u201cright side\u201d and one \u201cbottom side\u201d vertex of the centre), they must be unequal and sum to 180\u00b0, therefore they cannot *both* be 90\u00b0 unless all four centre angles are 90\u00b0 (square), but question says \"rectangle with different length sides\" \u2013 so cannot be a square. Therefore 90\u00b0 is impossible for *both* highlighted, and only one highlighted is 90\u00b0 if the other is 90\u00b0, which would require a square, hence prohibited. So it\u2019s impossible for either to be exactly 90\u00b0? Wait \u2014 actually careful: Diagonals of a non-square rectangle are not perpendicular, so each angle at centre is not 90\u00b0.

Conversely, if it doesn't intercept the \\(x\\)-axis, it certainly can\u2019t be factorised into real linear factors (with integers). So Katie\u2019s statement is correct within the curriculum framework; Tom\u2019s is false. A student might think *both are making logically equivalent statements* (confusing statement and its converse) and wrongly say both are correct.\n\n- **Option D (Neither):**  \nPerhaps arises if the student knows discriminant can be negative (no intercepts) but doesn\u2019t register factorisation is irrelevant to whether it *does* intercept, thinking:  \n\u2022 Tom wrong because not factorisable could still cross axis (correct)  \n\u2022 Katie wrong because \u201cnot intercepting \u21d2 cannot factorise\u201d \u2013 but actually it\u2019s true in real numbers; maybe they\u2019re confusing with \u201cfactorisable into integers\u201d vs. \u201calways factorisable in principle (complete the square etc.)\u201d? Might misinterpret Katie's statement as \"cannot be factorised at all in any sense\", but in GCSE terms it\u2019s correct.  \n\nKatie\u2019s statement works in the UK Year 9 scope: If graph doesn\u2019t intercept \\(x\\)-axis \u21d2 no real roots \u21d2 cannot factorise into real linear factors (so indeed \u201ccannot be factorised\u201d as far as they know).\n\nThus only Katie is correct.",

If they mistakenly take the x-coordinate at y=20 as about 20 kg (but slope shows ~0.45 kg per lb), they're thinking \u201cabout the same number\u201d (confusing kg with lb due to not noticing the axis labels carefully). It\u2019s an attractive mistake because numbers look \u201csymmetric\u201d on the graph.  \n\n**C) 44 kilograms** \u2013 This comes from reversing the conversion in the wrong direction: thinking \u201c20 kg = how many pounds?\u201d and estimating ~44 lb from the graph (which is close to the true conversion), then incorrectly applying that to the question as if it were \u201c20 pounds in kg\u201d. This is a very common misreading of what\u2019s being asked.  \n\n**D) 50 kilograms** \u2013 Possibly misreading the scale, or rounding a found conversion factor wrongly: if they noticed ~2.2 lb per kg but inverted it incorrectly (20 lb \u00d7 2.2 \u2248 44 lb then take that as kg? That\u2019s C) but D is slightly higher \u2014 perhaps they took 20 lb \u00d7 2.5 = 50). Alternatively, could stem from looking at where the line passes through roughly (25,55) and incorrectly estimating slope as \u201cdivide pounds by 1.something\u201d, but messing up units.  \n\n**A) 9 kilograms** \u2013 Correct reading: from y-axis (pounds) = 20, follow horizontally to line, then down to x-axis (kilograms) gives a value close to 9. Students who check the conversion sense know 1 kg \u2248 2.2 lb, so 20 lb should be < 10 kg.  \n\n**Proportion getting correct:** Many Year 9 students will rush graph reading or confuse axes, especially with lb/kg not in daily use for some.

They might think both are wrong except Tom's, because they incorrectly solve \\(-2m > 12\\) as \\(m > -6\\) and consider that valid, and \\(-2 + m > 12\\) as \\(m > 14\\) but possibly misread which inequality was being checked.  \n- **Option C (Both correct):** Students think the rules are always the same regardless of adding vs. multiplying by a negative; they just solved \\(-2m > 12\\) by dividing by \\(-2\\) without flipping the sign.  \n- **Option D (Neither correct):** They might flip the inequality in Katie's case erroneously after subtracting/adding, or they could think adding isn't allowed but also Tom got the flip wrong.  \n\n**Attractive traps:**  \n- Forgetting to flip the inequality when dividing by a negative is a very common mistake. This means many students will say Tom\u2019s method is fine because it \u201clooks\u201d like normal solving \u2014 this makes **A** or **C** tempting.  \n- Katie\u2019s solution is actually correct, so any student who memorised \u201cflip when multiply/divide by negative\u201d but not fully confident will check Tom\u2019s: see he didn\u2019t flip, mark it wrong; check Katie\u2019s: seems right. This yields **B**.  \n- Students not solid on algebra may pick **D** if they misapply \u201cdo the same to both sides\u201d or misinterpret the expressions (e.g. reading \\(-2+m\\) as \\(-2m\\)).  \n\n**Who would catch themselves?**  \nStudents comfortable with manipulating inequalities will spot Tom\u2019s mistake quickly and recognise Katie\u2019s simple rearrangement. Students weaker in algebra will often rush and equate solving methods across addition and multiplication.  \n\nGiven this is Year 9 near the end of the topic, many will still slip on Tom\u2019s part because the \"flip\" rule is easily forgotten in a quick exam question. But the question format asks \u201cwho is correct,\u201d prompting them to check each carefully. I\u2019d expect around **65%** to answer correctly because Katie\u2019s is obvious to most, but the trap in Tom\u2019s statement is deliberately testing a key, commonly-misapplied rule.  \n\nESTIMATE",

So they\u2019d wrongly think Tom\u2019s \\(\\frac{18\\times 180}{20}\\) is the only interior-angle formula.  \n\n**Option B (Only Katie)** \u2013 Some know the standard formula interior angle \\(=180 - \\frac{360}{n}\\), but think Tom\u2019s method is wrong because they don\u2019t recognise \\(\\frac{(n-2)\\times 180}{n}\\) rewritten as \\(\\frac{18 \\times 180}{20}\\) for \\(n=20\\) is the same thing.  \n\n**Option D (Neither correct)** \u2013 This could come from misremembering both formulae, e.g., thinking \\(\\frac{n-2}{n}\\times 180\\) uses \\(n\\) not \\(n-2\\), or mixing up when to divide by \\(n\\).  \n\n**\"Attractive\" errors:**  \nOption B might feel natural if students *only* remember Katie\u2019s approach from recent lessons; they may think Tom\u2019s method seems strange because \\(18 \\times 180\\) looks unrelated without factoring in \\(n-2\\).  \n\nStudents more familiar with deriving interior angle from polygon angle sum \\((n-2)\\times 180^\\circ\\) divided by \\(n\\) might recognise both forms and not be tricked. Year 9 students vary in confidence with rearranging formulas \u2013 weaker students may not realise these are equivalent.  \n\nGiven typical UK Year 9 exposure to interior/exterior angles:  \n- Many know Katie\u2019s method because \u201cexterior angles sum to 360\u201d is heavily emphasized.  \n- The stronger ones also know Tom\u2019s formula.  \n- The equivalence is not automatic for all, so I\u2019d expect a significant portion would mistakenly pick only Katie, and some pick only Tom.  \n\nConsidering the need to check both: I'd estimate around **60%** would choose the correct answer C.  \n\nESTIMATE: 60",

Each interval = (2 \u2013 (\u201310))/6 = 12/6 = 2. Bottom dash = \u201310, next up = \u20138, then \u20136, \u20134, \u20132, 0, 2. Middle dash (4th of 7 dashes) = \u20134. But a quick glance leads many to think interval = 2 units and middle = \u20132 or \u20131 if they mis-locate the counting start.\n\nThe majority of capable Year 9s should get this correct, but the \u201310 to 2 range across 6 equal intervals on a *7 dash* line is a known source of diagram-reading error for weaker students.\n\n**ESTIMATE: 65**",

For example, if step size = 2 marks between points, each mark = 2 units, then 4 marks above \u22128 is \u22128 + 8 = 0; but if they say \u201cbelow the top by 2 marks\u201d, they may mistakenly do 4 \u2212 4 = 0 OR in the wrong step: 4 \u2212 8 = \u22124. Mixing \u201cabove bottom\u201d with \u201cbelow top\u201d logic incorrectly could give \u22124.\n\n---\n\n**Likely correct answer prevalence:**\n\nThis question requires understanding that equal spacing means dividing the numerical range by the number of intervals (6 intervals here between \u22128 and 4, range 12 \u2192 each interval = 2 units). Many Year 9 pupils might skip the scale calculation entirely and go with visual \"two marks below 4\" \u2192 2 (option B).\n\nGiven this is a multiple-choice, that tempting wrong answer (B) will capture many. In a mixed-ability Year 9 class, probably more than half could calculate correctly if careful, but in an exam, speed and pressure lead to easy visual traps.  \nExperience suggests a weaker class might see success rate ~40%, a typical mixed class maybe 50\u201360%. I\u2019ll adjust downward to reflect that mock exams often catch pupils rushing.\n\nESTIMATE: 55",

Alternatively, they may wrongly believe parallel lines must intersect the \\(y\\)-axis at different points, eliminating Katie\u2019s pair.  \n- **Option C (Both Tom and Katie)** \u2013 The student doesn't recall that parallel means equal gradients, so they think any pair where the number before \\(x\\) is \"similar\" (2 and 3 both small?) counts as parallel, or they simply check whether the constants differ and assume both pairs are parallel because they \"don't look like they\u2019ll meet\" without calculating gradients properly.  \n- **Option D (Neither is correct)** \u2013 Student might misapply the idea that parallel lines must have identical equations, or they mistakenly think \\(y = 2x + 3\\) and \\(y = 2x - 3\\) are the same line (overlooking different intercepts) and thus \"not parallel\" because they think parallel lines cannot have different intercepts. A less common confusion could be swapping gradient comparison for intercept comparison entirely.  \n\n**Attractiveness:**  \n- Option A is relatively attractive because Tom\u2019s lines differ in both gradient and intercept, so a student hastily checking intercepts instead of gradients might think he\u2019s wrong (correct) but then wrongly dismiss Katie\u2019s by demanding same intercept.  \n- Option C is *most* attractive for those who haven\u2019t mastered gradient: they may recall that parallel lines \u201cnever meet,\u201d glance at Tom\u2019s pair (slopes 2 and 3) and believe they still won\u2019t meet because 2 and 3 are close, while clearly Katie\u2019s are parallel \u2013 so they pick both right.  \n\n**Year 9 performance:**  \nThis is near the start of learning linear graphs; many can recall \u201cparallel = same gradient\u201d when prompted directly in a lesson, but in a multi-choice setting, time pressure and miscalculation of gradients (e.g., misreading \\(y = 3x + 2\\) as \\(y = 2x + 3\\)) cause errors.  \n\nGiven its straightforwardness and typical classroom focus on gradient for parallelism, I\u2019d expect a majority to get it right in a mock",

Could cause trouble if a student mistakenly calculates \"\u22122 is less than 2\" wrongly (rare).  \n\n**Main trap**: Year 9 students may quickly look for \\( d < h \\) (strictly less) rather than allowing equality, but all except C fail even the \u201cless than\u201d test and the \u201cequal\u201d test\u2014so only C violates both. Likely errors:  \n1. Reading \"does not fit\" too quickly \u2014 thinking all except one **do** fit, but carelessly marking B because h is bigger, but B actually fits.  \n2. Mis-comparing negative vs. positive: thinking 2 \u2264 -4 must be true because -4 is further left on the number line \u2014 yes, but \u201c\u2264\u201d requires leftmost = smaller, so here 2 is actually to the right of -4, so 2 is greater than -4. Therefore false.  \n\nThis is primarily testing understanding of negative numbers and inequalities; relatively straightforward if careful, but common Year 9 errors from scanning negatives or misinterpreting \u201cdoes not fit\u201d.  \n\nGiven typical classroom performance on ordering negatives and inequality interpretation, I\u2019d estimate about **65%** answer",

Actually subtracting Pair 1 would give 2p\u22124q\u2212 (7p+4q) \u2192 \u20135p \u20138q, not eliminating q. This option is a mismatched guess without checking signs.  \n- **Option D (Subtract both)** \u2013 Here they might try to \u201cdo the same to both pairs,\u201d applying subtraction uniformly, but for Pair 1 subtraction makes q terms combine to \u20138q (not zero), so cancellation fails. Error is blindly repeating the same operation without adjusting for coefficient signs.  \n\n**Attractiveness of traps:**  \nOption B and D might seem neat and systematic (add for both or subtract for both) rather than the mixed strategy in A. Less careful students do not test each pair's combination in their head; they look for a rule like \u201cif same sign, subtract\u201d which actually applies to variables with equal coefficients and matching signs\u2014misapplied here when signs match in Pair 2 (\u2013 and \u2013).  \n\nWhich students catch themselves vs. fall into the trap? Careful ones check actual sum or difference: for Pair 1, (+4q) + (\u20134q) cancels on addition, so correct. For Pair 2, (\u20134q) \u2013 (\u20134q) cancels on subtraction. If hastily read, Pair 2 can look like both are \u201c\u20134q\u201d so adding seems to make \u20138q not zero.  \n\n**Estimated difficulty:** Quite straightforward if methodically tested, but Year 9 under time pressure often misgeneralize \"elimination steps\" without testing.  \n\n**ESTIMATE:** 65%",

Katie\u2019s parallelogram only has equal opposite sides, not equal angles unless it\u2019s a square/rhombus with equal angles, but it's drawn as a generic parallelogram here. A student choosing B has accepted \u201cparallelogram\u201d as regular but not checked the angles condition.  \n\n- **Option C (Both)** \u2013 The trap is thinking: \"Tom\u2019s triangle looks equilateral, Katie\u2019s parallelogram looks like all sides marked equal (maybe thinking rhombus) \u2192 both regular.\" But the diagram for Katie, though showing 2 pairs of parallel sides, doesn\u2019t indicate all sides equal *and* all angles equal; in fact a parallelogram generally isn\u2019t equiangular. Students visualising a \u201csquare\u201d parallelogram, or misreading the notation, might fall into this.\n\n- **Option D (Neither)** \u2013 This could happen if students misremember definition and think *regular = all sides equal AND all angles equal AND something extra* (e.g., \u201cmust be cyclic\u201d or \u201cmust have more than 3 sides\u201d), rejecting the equilateral triangle unfairly. Or they might think both are wrong if they consider Katie\u2019s obviously not regular, but also doubt if Tom\u2019s is really regular because \u201cit\u2019s just a triangle\u201d \u2014 overly strict interpretation.\n\nThe correct answer is A because only Tom\u2019s shape is both equilateral and equiangular (the definition of regular polygon).\n\n---\n\n**\u201cAttractiveness\u201d of errors:**  \nOption C is probably the most attractive incorrect choice because:  \n1.

Young students often focus on sides being equal, not on angles, so could imagine parallelogram has been marked with tick marks indicating equal sides all round.  \n\nOption B is less common but might be chosen if they *know* triangle regular requires specific case, but misjudge parallelogram due to hearing \u201cregular quadrilateral\u201d and wrongly apply to any quadrilateral with equal sides.  \n\nOption D suggests total definition misunderstanding.  \n\n---\n\nGiven this is Year 9, the definition of regular",

Weak. Actually not convincing.

The student has missed the middle term **\u201324y** because they treat it as the difference of squares *without* noticing the expression is a square of a binomial, not a product of sum and difference. This is a very common \"quick but wrong\" shortcut.\n\n- **Option B (9y\u00b2 + 16):** Similar to A but also making a sign error: (3y)\u00b2 + (4)\u00b2, forgetting both the middle term and the sign of the constant term after squaring. Less common than A, but arises from misremembering expansions and mishandling signs.\n\n- **Option D (3y \u2013 4)(3y \u2013 4):** This is literally just restating the question without expanding or simplifying. The student may think it asks to \u201cwrite in expanded form\u201d but misunderstands \u201cexpand\u201d to mean just rewriting without calculation, or they run out of time.

In a mock, maybe 60\u201370% would expand correctly, so slightly above the middle.

The number 30 looks plausible for a large volume, making it an attractive mistake.  \n\n**Option C (300 litres):**  \nA student could mistakenly multiply 3000 by 0.1 or think that since a litre is larger than a ml, there must be more litres.

Alternatively, a quick subtraction ignoring the negative sign of the -8 entirely:  \\(8 - 6 = 2\\). This is an \"attractive\" mistake because it\u2019s visually like removing brackets and seeing 6 - 8 but choosing positive difference by size.  \n\n**D) \\(-2\\)** \u2013 Most straightforward attractive wrong answer: incorrectly simplifying \\(6 - (-8)\\) as \\(6 - 8 = -2\\) (ignoring the rule that subtracting a negative means add).

This is an even bigger leap from the given numbers, often chosen if the student thinks of 3D shapes growing rapidly and does not check beyond the first term.  \n\nC) This corresponds to triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10). This is a common error because 1 and 3 match the first two given terms, and some students will assume the sequence continues with the next triangular numbers without checking term 3 (5 \u2260 6) or term 4 (7 \u2260 10). This is the most attractive trap, since the pattern\u2019s visible growth mimics adding one more each time, but the dots don\u2019t match 5 and 7.  \n\nD) Correct pattern: the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7 matches \u201codd numbers,\u201d and in the image it shows (from pattern 1 to 4):  \nPattern 1: 1 dot  \nPattern 2: a 2\u00d72 square missing top-left \u2192 4\u22121 = 3 dots  \nPattern 3: a 2\u00d73 rectangle missing top-left \u2192 6\u22121 = 5 dots  \nPattern 4: a 2\u00d74 rectangle missing top-left \u2192 8\u22121 = 7 dots.  \n\n**Difficulty estimation:**  \nMany Year 9 students will be drawn to triangular numbers (C) because 1 and 3 match, and not all check carefully.

If a student counts from 0 to the arrow incorrectly (possibly thinking it\u2019s the 3rd small mark but counting starting with the first division as 0.2, then second as 0.4, mistakenly gets 0.4), actually it seems they might confuse the *third tick* (if starting at 0 as tick 0), with tick labeled 3 meaning 0.3, which matches the picture if they mistake each tick value as \\(0.1\\) rather than \\(0.2\\).  \n\n- **C) 3** \u2013 This is a place-value or scale confusion, perhaps thinking the line goes 0\u20135, so arrow on third mark means 3, but ignoring the decimal range (0\u20131). Possibly also misreading \u201c0.6\u201d as a different format, or ignoring the decimal point entirely.  \n\n- **D) 0.5** \u2013 Could come from misreading the midpoint of the whole line, especially if the student approximates without counting exactly: five parts make each 0.2, the arrow is at the **third** tick (0.2, 0.4, 0.6) \u2014 some might think \u201chalfway between 0 and 1 in 5 divisions\u201d as maybe third tick means halfway, which is incorrect because third of five parts is \\( \\frac{3}{5}=0.6 \\). This is a visual midpoint trap.  \n\nGiven it\u2019s Year 9, interpreting number line scales is KS3 curriculum basics, but many students can rush, miscount, or fall for the \u201c0.3\u201d option due to hasty division thinking (1 divided into 5 parts, first tick is 0.2, they think \"it's the 3rd tick so 3 \u00d7 0.1 = 0.3\").\n\nThe correct answer involves: seeing **5 parts**, each 0.2, arrow at 3rd tick \u2192 \\(3 \\times 0.2 = 0.6\\).  \n\nExpected success rate should be high but careless errors will happen.  \nLikely around **75%** get it right in a mixed-ability",

Possibly stems from a misremembered rule \u201cgo 5 in the next place for the smallest\u201d.\n\n- **Correct: B) 3.995** \u2014 This is correct because rounding to 2 decimal places uses the *third* decimal place: from 3.995 to two decimals, the third digit is 5, so it rounds up to 4.00; any smaller number (e.g., 3.994999\u2026) would round to 3.99.\n\nAmong Year 9 students, rounding to decimal places is familiar but bounds are often confusing; many mistakenly think the lower bound starts at exactly halfway, while others truncate or pick overly simple small numbers.

This mixes up the conversion with \"hectogram\" or \"quintal\" ideas, or with metre\u2013centimetre scaling.  \n\n**Option C (300)** \u2013 This error likely comes from dividing by 10 (\\( 3000 \\div 10 = 300 \\)), perhaps confusing kilograms\u2013tonnes with kilograms\u2013\"centner\" (100 kg) or mistakenly applying a rule of thumb from related metric conversions like metres to kilometres (divide by 1000) but wrongly placing the decimal.  \n\n**Option D (3000000)** \u2013 This indicates multiplication rather than division, wrongly converting as if 1 kg = 1000 tonnes, or possibly confusing with converting tonnes to grams (1 tonne = 1,000,000 g), but here mistakenly thinking the answer asks for grams, not tonnes.  \n\n**Which errors are \"attractive\"?**  \nOption B is the most plausible attractive trap because some students recall that smaller metric units often go in 100s (e.g., cm in a metre), and 100 kg feels familiar in some contexts (like a \"quintal\" in some countries\u2019 agriculture). Option C is also attractive for those rushing and dividing by 10 instead of 1000.  \n\nOption D arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of direction of conversion, but is less likely for students who recognise \"kg\" is smaller than \"tonne\" \u2013 multiplication wouldn\u2019t make sense if the unit is getting bigger.  \n\n**Catching mistakes** \u2013 Careful students may recall the standard 1000 kg = 1 tonne, do \\( 3000 \\div 1000 = 3 \\), and realise the answer must be simple. Students who know \"kilo\" means 1000 might avoid all traps.  \n\n---\n\n**Estimated success rate**  \nSince this is a basic metric conversion commonly taught and used in UK schools by Year 9, and the numbers are straightforward, most should answer correctly despite B and C being tempting for a minority with poor recall of conversion factors.  \n\nGiven confusion between tonne (1000 kg) and smaller relationships, I\u2019d expect about **85%** of Year 9 students to answer correctly.",

Let\u2019s check: \\(2/(-2) = (-2)/2 = -1\\), so if \\(P=-Q\\) (different numbers), equality holds. But then\u2026are \\(2\\) and \\(-2\\) considered \"two different numbers\"? Usually yes. However, the UK Year 9 curriculum likely means positive different numbers unless specified. Tricky \u2014 some students might pick \"sometimes\" because of cases like \\(a = -b\\). The question implicitly assumes numbers are positive (typical Year 9 setting)? They didn\u2019t state positive but often default to it. If considering negatives, it **is** sometimes true. But many texts treat it as \"never true for different numbers\" meaning distinct absolute values or just ignoring sign? It\u2019s actually sometimes true: example 5 and -5 gives -1 both ways. Wait\u2014conjecture says \"if you have two different numbers\", so 5 and -5 are different, and \\(5 \\div (-5) = (-5) \\div 5\\). Then equality holds! So indeed **sometimes true** if negative numbers allowed. Hmm \u2014 so is the \u201ccorrect answer\u201d in mark scheme C (never true)? Possibly the exam expects \u201cnever true\u201d because Year 9 usually restricts to positive integers.  \n\nGiven the options, if negatives are allowed, mathematically the answer is **B**. But UK KS3 often first introduces division with positive integers only \u2014 and the teaching point is to spot that division is not commutative, so the \"correct\" answer they expect is C (never true).  \n\n**From marking experience:**  \n\nMany will pick A if they\u2019re overgeneralising, especially lower ability.",

Students see two decimals but divide them in the order written without checking the number of times 0.4 fits into 0.2 \u2014 incorrectly thinking \"0.4 is bigger, but maybe division reverses them\" or just performing the larger divided by the smaller automatically.\n\n**Reasoning about difficulty**:  \nStudents secure with fractions will rewrite as \\(\\frac{0.2}{0.4} = \\frac{2}{4}\\) easily. Many Year 9 students, however, are vulnerable to decimal division errors \u2014 particularly A and D are strong distractors, with D appealing to those who automatically put the larger number first in division.\n\nGiven this is a non-calculator basic skill item, but with common trip-ups, I\u2019d estimate many could get it right, but around half may slip up on an initial mock. Year 9 mid-ability often find this only partly secure, with quick-review improving rates.\n\nESTIMATE: 65",

They see \\(-28\\) and think \\(a \\times b = 28\\), neglecting that for \\(m^2+3m-28\\), the numbers must multiply to \\(-28\\).  \n\n**Option C (-28) \u2013 correct:**  \nThe student correctly realises that if \\(m^2 + 3m - 28 \\equiv (m+a)(m+b)\\), then expanding gives \\(a+b = 3\\) and \\(a \\times b = -28\\), as per comparing coefficients.  \n\nThe most attractive trap is **D**, because when teaching factoring we say \u201clook for two numbers that multiply to the constant term\u201d \u2013 here the constant is \\(-28\\), so a careless reader just takes \\(28\\).  \nOption A attracts those who mix up sum/product, possibly due to hurried reading.  \nBetter students will check the expansion in their head and realise \\(a \\times b\\) must equal \\(-28\\).  \n\nFor Year 9, this is a basic factoring identification question but with a sign trap in the constant term. Many will spot it, but errors D and A will catch some. Given it\u2019s a multiple choice mock, they have a 1 in 4 chance of guessing; stronger pupils will derive it correctly.  \n\nConsidering typical Year 9 performance on factorization:  \nESTIMATE: 65",

The arm lines up between 130 and 140 on the inner scale (135\u00b0), but the correct reading uses the outer scale where that same arm aligns between 40 and 50 (45\u00b0) from 0 on the right, giving 45\u00b0 total. Students may wrongly start from the left 0 line (mentally) and use the inner scale, but the protractor\u2019s right side has its zero on the inner scale at 0\u00b0, so this mix-up is plausible but less common here unless scale choice is careless.\n\n- **B** (~125\u00b0): Again using the inner scale but misreading the position: halfway between 120 and 130 on inner scale is 125\u00b0, instead of using the outer scale (halfway between 50 and 60 gives 55\u00b0 on the outer when measured from the right-side zero). This error is classic \u2014 the student ignores which zero line matches the given arm of the angle.\n\n- **C** (~45\u00b0): Here the student probably used the correct zero line on the right but read the outer scale as 45\u00b0 (halfway between 140 and 130) from 0, which is correct reading but confusing diagram description: in C the other arm seems from 0 inner scale left? Actually verifying, in C the blue angle sector is small (<90\u00b0), arm at right zero line and other at between 40-50 inner (45\u00b0). So they read correctly but the answer would be 45\u00b0, not 55\u00b0. The misconception could just be misreading the scale numbers (inner vs outer) depending on description clarity, but in C it actually shows ~45\u00b0, so selecting C means misjudging 45\u00b0 as 55\u00b0 (might come from roughly estimating by eye without careful reading). Possibly they\u2019ve used the wrong zero line but then read opposite scale wrongly for a small angle, getting 45\u00b0, so not 55\u00b0.\n\n**Which errors are \u201cattractive\u201d?**  \nMost attractive trap: Option B \u2014 because if you quickly look at the protractor\u2019s numbers near where the second arm points, you see the bigger number on the inner scale (125\u00b0) and may think that\u2019s the angle size without checking zero alignment.

The only reason it could be marked \u201cincorrect\u201d here would be if the test expects the form with the 6 outside parentheses as a factor on the left.

It is an attractive mistake for students rushing or not visualising that angles must be constructed at the correct vertices.  \n\n**B)** This option incorrectly uses compass widths corresponding to the angle measures (40 cm, 50 cm) instead of constructing angles with a protractor.

This reflects misremembering the average formula as sum \u00d7 count, which is attractive if the student sees /2 but incorrectly recalls that \u201cmean = sum \u00d7 number of data points\u201d (confusion with \u201ctotal = mean \u00d7 number\u201d).  \n\n- **Option C (85)**: Possibly results from *column addition error*: 54 + 58 might be incorrectly added as 54 + 58 = 102? But even then, half of 102 is 51 \u2014 so not C. Alternatively, could be misreading the problem as 54 + 58 \u00f7 2, doing division first (58 \u00f7 2 = 29) then 54 + 29 = 83 (close to 85) \u2014 a BIDMAS error. Another path: 54 + 58 = 112, 112 \u00f7 2 mis-calculated by treating 112 \u00f7 2 as around \u201c85\u201d (a gross approximation slip).  \n\n- **Option D (51)**: Could result from halving only the second number, then adding: 54 + (58\u00f72) = 54 + 29 = 83, not 51. More likely, could come from halving each number first, then adding: (54\u00f72) + (58\u00f72) = 27 + 29 = 56, correct. So D seems like pure guess or serious miscalculation of halving 112 \u2014 perhaps incorrectly subtracting or dividing in steps: 110 \u00f7 2 = 55, plus 2 \u00f7 2 = 1, total 56; if they instead did 50 + 50 = 100 \u00f7 2 = 50, plus (4+8) = 12 \u00f7 2 = 6, 50 + 6 = 56 \u2014 but wrongly thinking 100 \u00f7 2 = 50 then 4+8=12 somehow giving total = 51 is forced. May be mistaken halving of digits: e.g., 54 \u00f7 2 = 27, 58 \u00f7 2 = 24, then 27 + 24 = 51 \u2014 halving 58 to 24 would involve (50\u00f72=25 and 8\u00f72=4, wrongly making 24",

The misconception is failing to notice that two sides are also given lengths\u2014these would need a ruler or compass, but a ruler is *also* needed to draw straight sides of given lengths even after a protractor is used for the angle.  \n- **B (Ruler + Compass)**: This is the \"classic\" ruler-and-compass construction misconception. The student sees sides but overlooks that the angle is specified in the diagram, making using a protractor the most practical way to reproduce it precisely in a mock exam construction question. They assume all triangles can be made with just compasses (maybe thinking of SSS triangle construction).  \n- **D (Ruler + Protractor)**: Students may think they only need to measure lengths and angle without realizing that compasses help mark off the exact length of the second side from the vertex of the angle (though using a ruler could also do that). In UK Year 9 exams, construction questions often include compass use when side lengths must be transferred\u2014so this omission is a failure to spot the construction arcs or understand typical school construction methods.  \n\n**\"Attractive\" Errors**:  \nOption B is likely the most attractive wrong answer for stronger students who over-generalise from \"ruler and compass constructions\" in geometry lessons. Weaker students may pick D because they see tools for measuring but don't recall *construction* requires compass to transfer lengths.  \n\nOption A appeals if students notice the angle but then assume compasses alone would manage sides (they usually don\u2019t think clearly about needing the ruler in addition for straight drawn lines of measured lengths).  \n\nOption C is correct because constructing a triangle given two sides and the included angle (SAS) in a UK classroom typically uses:  \n1. Ruler to draw baseline of one length.  \n2. Protractor to mark the angle.  \n3. Ruler or compass to mark the second side length\u2014here usually compass to step off the length from the angle vertex, then ruler to join points for the third side.\n\n**Estimate of Success**:  \nThis is a multi-step reasoning question and Year 9 often struggle with visualising steps in construction, confusing tools.

Option B is attractive to those approximating without exact calculation. Option C will trap very few, perhaps those making random decimal slips.\n\nThis is a basic metric conversion taught by Year 7, but errors persist.

Students confuse \\( (a-b)^2 \\) with \\( (a-b)(a+b) \\), or simply forget the middle term in the expansion.  \n\n- **Option C:** A possible sign error from \\( (2y-3)^2 \\) thought to be \\( (2y)^2 + (3)^2 \\), maybe due to misremembering \\( (a-b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\) (ignoring the sign and the middle term).  \n\nThe correct expansion is: \\( (2y - 3)^2 = 4y^2 - 12y + 9 \\).  \n\n**Attractiveness of errors:**  \nOption B is probably the most common trap \u2014 it\u2019s neat, involves easy arithmetic, and results from a formula mix-up some Year 9 students still make.  \nOption C is less common but might attract students rushing and focusing only on squaring each term without keeping signs in mind.  \nOption A is attractive to students who don\u2019t understand \u201cexpand\u201d fully.  \n\n**Catch vs. trap:**  \nCareful students would check for the middle term \\( 2 \\times (2y) \\times (-3) = -12y \\), eliminating A, B, and C immediately. Others might square each term and miss middle terms entirely.  \n\nGiven this is Year 9 and expansion of brackets is core but often error-prone, I would expect a modest success rate, especially in a non-calculator mock.  \n\n**ESTIMATE:** 65%",

Or confusion with writing money values in pounds.  \n\n**Which errors are \u201cattractive\u201d?**  \nA is very attractive because moving one decimal place is a common careless slip for students when converting percentages.
