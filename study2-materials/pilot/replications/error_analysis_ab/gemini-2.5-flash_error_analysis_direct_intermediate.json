For example, if a student misremembers factoring rules and factors the numerator as \\((m-3)(m-1)\\), they would get \\(m-1\\) after cancellation.

They might fail to consider that if the rectangle is very long and thin, these angles *can* be acute (or vice versa for the other pair). Or they might incorrectly assume the highlighted angles *always* appear in a pair with an obtuse angle, thus must always be acute themselves.\n*   **B) obtuse:** Similar to choosing acute, but in reverse. A student might picture a rectangle that is relatively 'squarish' and visualise the angles as being obtuse. They might fail to recognise that as the rectangle changes proportions, the angles also change and can become acute.\n*   **D) Not enough information:** This suggests a student doesn't understand the underlying geometric principles governing these angles. They might feel they *need* specific side lengths to determine the angles, not realising that some angle types are fundamentally impossible *regardless* of specific dimensions. They might also incorrectly believe that without knowing side lengths, one *cannot* say anything definitive about the possible range of the angles.\n*   **C) 90\u00b0 (Correct Answer):** The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, but only intersect at 90\u00b0 if and only if the rectangle is a square. The question specifies \"different length sides,\" explicitly excluding a square. In a non-square rectangle, the diagonals intersect at two pairs of non-right angles (one acute pair and one obtuse pair). The highlighted angles are one of these pairs. They will therefore never be 90\u00b0.\n\n**Attractiveness of Errors & Student Catch-Points:**\n\n*   **D) Not enough information:** This is *very* attractive. Year 9 students often lack confidence in abstract geometric reasoning and look for concrete numerical values. Without them, \"not enough information\" feels like a safe out. Students who tend to struggle with generalisations and rely on examples would fall here.

They might be mixing up place value concepts (e.g., 'sixty-two tenths') with percentages, or perhaps simplifying incorrectly very early on by dividing by ten and then forgetting to apply the same to the numerator, though the latter seems less likely to yield this exact form from 62/100. More likely is the fundamental misunderstanding of the denominator for percentages. This is an \"attractive\" distractor because the \"62\" is right, and \"10\" is a simple, familiar number.\n\n*   **C) $\\frac{6}{2}$**: This student seems to be attempting to 'simplify' the digits within the 62% in a very literal and incorrect way, perhaps by dividing 6 by 2. This suggests a very basic lack of understanding of what a percentage represents or how to convert it to a fraction, ignoring the 'per cent' meaning entirely.

It's an attractive distractor for students who don't properly recall division by 10 rules.\n\n*   **D) \\( 43.02 \\)**\n    This error is particularly interesting. It suggests a misunderstanding of how decimal places shift. The student might be thinking that dividing by 10 affects only the digit in the tenths column, subtracting 2 from the \"10\" (the value '2' represents two tenths), leading to 02, and keeping the rest of the number the same. Alternatively, it could be a misunderstanding of adding or subtracting 10 rather than dividing by it, perhaps changing the tens digit but confusing its placement. It could also be a visual error, where the student sees the '0' appear in some calculations and tries to force it in without understanding the mechanism.\n\n**Attractiveness & Self-Correction:**\n\n*   **B** is highly attractive.

He is not making a claim about their size.\n\n*   **B) Only Katie:** A student choosing this likely recognizes that alternate angles are equal *sometimes* but misunderstands that this equality only holds when the lines are parallel. They might struggle to differentiate between the name/position and the property of equality. This answer suggests a partial understanding, but a crucial detail is missed.\n\n*   **C) Both Tom and Katie:** This is a very \"attractive\" distractor. Students frequently learn \"alternate angles are equal\" as a combined concept and forget the crucial parallel line condition. They would correctly identify $p$ and $q$ as alternate in position and then incorrectly assume they are equal because they've been *told* alternate angles are equal. They are likely applying a rule without checking all its conditions. Many students, especially those who struggle to grasp the \"if parallel then equal\" nuance, will fall into this trap.\n\n*   **D) Neither is correct:** This suggests a complete lack of understanding of angle pair names. Students might confuse them with corresponding or allied angles, or simply not recognise their positioning as \"alternate\". This could also be a \"guess if unsure\" option for students with very low confidence.\n\n**Which errors are \"attractive\"?**\n\nOption C is extremely attractive. The phrasing \"alternate angles are equal\" is deeply embedded for many students. They might not explicitly remember or consider the \"if parallel lines\" condition unless prompted or if the lines are explicitly marked as parallel.\n\n**Which students would catch themselves vs. fall into the trap?**\n\n*   **Catch themselves:** Students who have a robust conceptual understanding of angle properties, knowing that the \"equal\" property of alternate (or corresponding) angles is *conditional* on the lines being parallel. They differentiate between naming an angle pair and stating a relationship about their magnitudes. They would notice the lack of parallel markings. These students often excel"

Alternatively, it could be a simple miscalculation if a student tries to do 180 + 16 = 196 and then completely forgets Tori's time, or simply makes an arithmetic error during subtraction (214 - (180 + 16)) which leads to this number. It feels less directly attributable to one common error. More likely, a student correctly calculates Hannah's time as 196, and then somehow subtracts it from Tori's (196-214 is a negative difference) but then they get muddled with the calculation or simply ignore Tori's time, assuming 196 is *the* difference somehow. A more probable source of 196 would be converting 3 hours 16 minutes to 196 minutes *and then choosing that as the answer without finding the difference*. This suggests not fully reading the question.\n\n*   **B) 18 minutes (Correct Answer):** This requires correctly converting 3 hours and 16 minutes into minutes (3 * 60 + 16 = 180 + 16 = 196 minutes) and then subtracting Tori's time from Hannah's time (214 - 196 = 18 minutes). No specific calculation error involved here for those who get it right.\n\n*   **C) 102 minutes:** This is an attractive distractor! This error arises from misinterpreting \"3 hours and 16 minutes\" as 3.16 hours and converting it incorrectly to minutes (e.g., 3 hours = 180 minutes, then incorrectly adding 16 * 60 to the 180, or adding 16 directly to the minutes rather than considering it part of an hour calculation).

Standard ratio sharing problem, perfect for Year 9, checks fundamental understanding and application.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n*   **A) 16 m:** This comes from misunderstanding what the 3:5 ratio means.

So, the magnitude of the move is what's implied for *b*. If the options are all integers, it suggests they want the magnitude. Let's re-read carefully: \"arrow labelled b pointing to the left\". If the move is subtract 'b', then 'b' would be a positive number representing the length. But the options have negative values. This is where it can get tricky.
