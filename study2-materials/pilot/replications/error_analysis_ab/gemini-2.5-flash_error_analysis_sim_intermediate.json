The diagram shows two adjacent angles where the diagonals intersect. The question asks what they can *never* be.\n*   **A) Acute & B) Obtuse:** These are valid angles for the intersection of diagonals in a rectangle, provided it's not a square. As the rectangle stretches, one pair of angles will become very acute, and the other very obtuse. If it's a square, all angles are 90 degrees.\n*   **C) 90 degrees:** This is the correct answer. The highlighted angles *can* be 90 degrees if and only if the rectangle is a square. However, the question states \"a rectangle with **different length sides**\". This critical detail means it cannot be a square. Therefore, the angles formed by the intersection of diagonals in such a rectangle can *never* be 90 degrees. This requires careful reading and an understanding that a square is a specific type of rectangle (all sides equal), and the given condition excludes that case.\n*   **D) Not enough information:** This is a common \"cop-out\" for students who feel stuck or believe there's a trick. It suggests they don't know how to determine the properties of these angles.\n\n**Student Thought Processes at Different Levels:**\n\n*   **Below Basic:** May struggle to identify the angles, confused by \"different length sides,\" or just guess. Might think of rectangle corners being 90, so the middle must also be. May pick \"obtuse\" if one angle looks obtuse and doesn't consider the \"never be\" aspect. \"Not enough info\" is also attractive here if they are truly lost.\n*   **Basic:** Might grasp that the angles aren't fixed 90 degrees. They probably know that a rectangle's diagonals are equal and bisect each other, forming isosceles triangles. They'll likely recognise that angles can be acute or obtuse depending on the rectangle's shape. They might miss the \"different length sides\" implication for the 90-degree case"

To find the area, you'd need to find the perpendicular height, which would involve Pythagoras (e.g., height = sqrt(12^2 - 6^2) = sqrt(144 - 36) = sqrt(108) = 6sqrt(3)).
