To approach this question, let's analyze the sequence and the options provided.

The sequence starts with a rectangle made of 3 squares stacked vertically (Pattern 1), then adds 2 squares to the right of the bottom 2 squares (Pattern 2), making it 5 squares. For Pattern 3, it adds 2 more squares to the right of the bottom 2 squares of Pattern 2, making it 7 squares. For Pattern 4, it adds 2 more squares to the right of the bottom 2 squares of Pattern 3, making it 9 squares.

The pattern in the number of squares added each time is consistent: Pattern 1 has 3 squares, Pattern 2 has 5 squares (an increase of 2), Pattern 3 has 7 squares (an increase of 2), and Pattern 4 has 9 squares (an increase of 2). So, the next pattern (Pattern 5) should have 9 + 2 = 11 squares.

Now, let's examine the structure: 
- Pattern 1: 3 squares (3x1)
- Pattern 2: 5 squares (3 + 2)
- Pattern 3: 7 squares (5 + 2)
- Pattern 4: 9 squares (7 + 2)

This suggests that each pattern increases by 2 squares.

Looking at the options for Pattern 5:
- A: A 4x2 rectangle plus an extra square on top (8 + 1 = 9 squares)
- B: A 5x2 rectangle plus an extra square on top (10 + 1 = 11 squares)
- C: A 5x2 rectangle plus 2 extra squares on top (10 + 2 = 12 squares)
- D: A 5x2 rectangle plus an extra square on top and another to the right (10 + 2 = 12 squares)

The correct pattern should reflect an increase to 11 squares as per the sequence.

## Predictions

### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with pattern recognition and basic arithmetic. They might not accurately count or predict the next in the sequence.
- A=30% (simple addition error, thinking the pattern just grows by one square each time or misinterpreting the visual)
- B=20% (some understanding of adding 2 each time but might miscalculate or misunderstand the visual)
- C=20% (overestimating the growth)
- D=30% (misinterpreting the visual addition)

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding but might make simple arithmetic errors or misunderstand the pattern.
- A=10% (recognizing the visual but underestimating the sequence growth)
- B=60% (getting the arithmetic right or close and understanding the sequence)
- C=15% (adding too many squares)
- D=15% (also adding too many squares but differently)

### proficient
These students understand patterns and sequences well and are less likely to make simple arithmetic errors.
- A=5% (underestimating)
- B=80% (accurately predicting the next pattern)
- C=10% (overestimating)
- D=5% (misinterpreting the visual)

### advanced
Advanced students not only understand the pattern but can also generalize and apply it accurately.
- A=0% (unlikely to underestimate given their skill level)
- B=90% (accurately predicting and understanding the sequence)
- C=5% (minor miscalculation)
- D=5% (alternative but incorrect visual interpretation)

Given the format required for the response:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
