## Step 1: Understand the question and the table of values
The question provides a table of values for the equation \( y = 2x + c \) and asks to find the value that should replace the star (\( \star \)) in the table. The given table is:
\[ \begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l} 
x & & 0 & 3 \\
\hline
y & -5 & -3 & \star 
\end{tabular} \]
We need to find \( c \) and then use it to calculate \( y \) when \( x = 3 \).

## 2: Determine the value of \( c \) using given points
Using the point \( (0, -3) \), we substitute \( x = 0 \) and \( y = -3 \) into the equation \( y = 2x + c \) to find \( c \):
\[ -3 = 2(0) + c \]
\[ -3 = c \]
So, \( c = -3 \).

## 3: Verify \( c \) with another point and calculate \( \star \)
Let's verify \( c \) using the point \( (x, y) = (-5, ??) \) is not directly given, but we have \( (-5, -5) \):
\[ -5 = 2(-5) + c \]
\[ -5 = -10 + c \]
\[ c = 5 \]
However, this seems to conflict with our finding. The confusion arises from incorrect use of data. Correctly, using \( (0, -3) \):
\[ -3 = 2*0 + c \]
\[ c = -3 \]
Now, to find \( \star \) (when \( x = 3 \)):
\[ y = 2*3 - 3 \]
\[ y = 6 - 3 \]
\[ y = 3 \]

## 4: Analyze potential student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substituting values into the equation or solving for \( c \) and then \( y \). They might incorrectly assume \( c \) is 0 or another simple value, or they might not understand how to use the given points to solve for \( c \) and then \( \star \). Given the straightforward nature of this specific question once \( c \) is identified, errors might still occur but let's assume a high chance of getting it wrong due to confusion with \( c \) and substituting \( x \) and \( y \) values.

- **Basic**: Students here might understand the concept of substituting into an equation but could struggle with solving for \( c \) correctly or making calculation errors. They might get \( c = -3 \) correctly but then struggle to calculate \( y \) for \( x = 3 \), or they might choose an option that seems plausible without calculation.

- **Proficient**: These students should easily find \( c = -3 \) and then calculate \( y \) for \( x = 3 \) as \( 3 \), choosing the correct option.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only solve it correctly but might also verify their answers or use the equation to check other given \( y \) values.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the calculations:
- The correct answer is \( B = 3 \).

## 6: Making Predictions
- **Below Basic**: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20% (Many might guess or make basic calculation errors)
- **Basic**: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10% (Most understand the process but might make minor errors)
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2% (High accuracy with correct understanding)
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=95% C=4% D=1% (Very high accuracy with possibly checking calculations)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=4% D=1%
