To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question.

The question requires comparing percentages, decimals, and fractions. The key comparisons are:
1. \(45\% > 0.059\)
2. \(45\% > \frac{16}{31}\)

First, convert all values to a comparable format, such as decimals:
- \(45\% = 0.45\)
- \(0.059\) remains the same.
- \(\frac{16}{31} \approx 0.516\)

## Step 1: Analyze the first comparison
For \(45\% > 0.059\), converting \(45\%\) to a decimal gives \(0.45\). Since \(0.45 > 0.059\), Tom is correct in this statement.

## 2: Analyze the second comparison
For \(45\% > \frac{16}{31}\), since \(\frac{16}{31} \approx 0.516\), and \(0.45 < 0.516\), Katie is incorrect because \(45\%\) is less than \(\frac{16}{31}\).

## 3: Determine the correct answer
Given that Tom is correct and Katie is incorrect, the correct answer is:
- A: Only Tom

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with conversions and comparisons. They might find it hard to convert percentages to decimals or compare fractions and decimals accurately. 
  - A: 30% (some might correctly identify Tom but struggle with Katie's statement)
  - B: 15% (incorrectly think only Katie is right)
  - C: 10% (incorrectly think both are right)
  - D: 45% (think neither is correct due to confusion)

- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still struggle with the fraction to decimal conversion or the comparison.
  - A: 60% (can correctly compare but might make errors with fractions)
  - B: 10% (think only Katie is right)
  - C: 5% (think both are right)
  - D: 25% (think neither is correct)

- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to understand the conversions and comparisons accurately.
  - A: 80% (correctly identify Tom and can see Katie's error)
  - B: 5% (some might mistakenly think Katie is right)
  - C: 2% (unlikely to think both are right)
  - D: 13% (some might still be unsure)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of these concepts.
  - A: 95% (easily see Tom is correct and Katie is not)
  - B: 1% (very few would mistakenly think Katie is right)
  - C: 1% (very few would think both are right)
  - D: 3% (unlikely to think neither is correct)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=10% D=45%
basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=2% D=13%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=1% D=3%
