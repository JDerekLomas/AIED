## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests.
The question requires students to describe the movement from point \( \mathrm{V} \) at \( (2,2) \) to point \( \mathrm{W} \) at \( (-3,-1) \) on a coordinate grid. The correct approach involves calculating the difference in x-coordinates and y-coordinates to determine the horizontal and vertical movements, respectively.

## 2: Calculate the correct movement.
To move from \( \mathrm{V} (2,2) \) to \( \mathrm{W} (-3,-1) \), we calculate the differences:
- Horizontal movement: \( -3 - 2 = -5 \), meaning we move left 5 squares.
- Vertical movement: \( -1 - 2 = -3 \), meaning we move down 3 squares.
So, the correct movement is left 5 squares, down 3 squares.

## 3: Identify the correct option.
Based on the calculation, the correct option is B: Left \( 5 \) squares, down \( 3 \) squares.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with coordinate geometry and calculating movements. They might incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the concept of moving on a grid. Option A (Left \( 4 \) squares, down \( 3 \) squares) could be appealing if they mistakenly calculate the horizontal distance as 4 instead of 5. Expect a significant spread across incorrect options due to fundamental misunderstandings.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make simple arithmetic errors. They are more likely to choose B but could be tempted by A if they miscount the squares.
- **Proficient:** These students understand coordinate geometry well and are less likely to make arithmetic errors. They should predominantly choose B.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately without error. They will choose B.

## 5: Estimate percentages for each ability level.
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (because they might incorrectly calculate or assume a smaller movement), B=20% (correct but struggling), C=20% (misunderstanding direction), D=30% (another incorrect direction).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=80% (mostly correct), C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=95%, C=2%, D=3%.

## 6: Format the estimates according to the required format.
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2% D=3%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2% D=3%
