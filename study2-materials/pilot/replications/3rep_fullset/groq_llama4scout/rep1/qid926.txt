To approach this question, let's analyze what it's testing and the potential difficulties students might face.

The question requires students to understand the concept of factors and how they relate to dividing a quantity (in this case, cakes) equally among a group of people without any leftovers. The key term here is "factors," which are numbers that divide into another number exactly without leaving a remainder.

## Step 1: Understanding the Concept of Factors
Factors of a number are the numbers that can be multiplied together to get that number. For example, the factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 because each of these numbers can divide 24 without leaving a remainder.

## 2: Analyzing the Question's Requirements
The question asks students to identify what Emma needs to know about 24 to determine how many friends she can give equal amounts of cake to without any leftovers. This directly relates to finding the factors of 24, as these factors represent the possible numbers of friends Emma can give cakes to equally.

## 3: Evaluating the Options
- A: factors - This is the correct answer because knowing the factors of 24 will tell Emma how many groups of friends she can divide the cakes among equally.
- B: digits - This refers to the individual numbers that make up a larger number (e.g., the digits of 24 are 2 and 4). Knowing the digits doesn't help in dividing the cakes equally.
- C: multiples - Multiples are the numbers that a given number can divide into evenly. While related to factors, multiples of 24 would tell you how many cakes you could have in total if you have groups of 24, not how to divide 24 cakes among friends.
- D: reciprocal - The reciprocal of a number is 1 divided by that number. This concept is unrelated to dividing a quantity into equal groups.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
Given the clarity of the question and the direct relationship between factors and the ability to divide a quantity into equal parts without leftovers, most students, even at lower ability levels, should be able to identify the correct answer as "factors."

## 5: Ability Level Predictions
- **below_basic:** At this level, students might struggle with basic mathematical vocabulary and concepts. They might confuse factors with multiples or not fully understand the question. 
  - A=60% (some understanding of basic concepts, but might be confused)
  - B=20% (confusing with digits)
  - C=10% (confusing with multiples)
  - D=10% (unlikely to understand reciprocal in this context)
- **basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding of math concepts and should be able to differentiate between factors and other terms.
  - A=80% (understand the concept of factors)
  - B=10% (less confusion with digits)
  - C=5% (less confusion with multiples)
  - D=5% (unlikely to choose reciprocal)
- **proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of mathematical concepts, including factors.
  - A=95% (strong understanding of factors and their application)
  - B=3% (minimal confusion)
  - C=1% (minimal confusion)
  - D=1% (unlikely to choose reciprocal)
- **advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also apply it accurately and efficiently.
  - A=99% (excellent understanding)
  - B=1% (rare confusion)
  - C=0% (no confusion with multiples)
  - D=0% (no chance of choosing reciprocal)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
