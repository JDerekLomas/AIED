## Step 1: Understand the equation and the task
The equation given is \(y = x^2 - 1\), and we need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 5\).

## 2: Calculate the correct value of \(y\)
To find \(y\), substitute \(x = 5\) into the equation: \(y = 5^2 - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24\).

## 3: Identify the correct answer choice
The correct calculation yields \(y = 24\), which corresponds to option A.

## 4: Consider common misconceptions or errors
A common error might involve incorrectly applying the order of operations or misinterpreting the equation. For example, some students might calculate \(y = 5^2 - 1\) as \(y = 5 \times 2 - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9\), which would lead them to choose option B.

## 5: Assess the difficulty level for different ability groups
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and are likely to make significant errors. They might choose any option randomly or based on a very superficial understanding of the equation.
- **Basic**: Students at this level can perform simple algebraic tasks but might not fully understand the equation's structure. They are likely to make calculation errors.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand algebraic equations and can apply them correctly. They are less likely to make errors in simple substitutions.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand algebraic equations but can also manipulate them and apply them in complex contexts. They are highly unlikely to make errors in simple tasks like this.

## 6: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
Given the simplicity of the question and the straightforward nature of the calculation:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (getting it right by chance or correct calculation), B=30% (simple error), C=20% (another type of error), D=30% (yet another error or random choice).
- **Basic**: A=70% (correct calculation), B=15% (error in calculation), C=5% (less common error), D=10% (rare error or misunderstanding).
- **Proficient**: A=90% (correct calculation), B=5% (minor error), C=2% (rare error), D=3% (very rare error).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (correct calculation), B=2% (unusual error), C=1% (very rare error), D=2% (extremely rare error).

## 7: Convert predictions into the required format
Based on the assessments:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
