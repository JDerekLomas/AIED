To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The graph shows distance from home over time, with a section that slopes negatively. This negative slope indicates that the distance from home is decreasing over time.

## Step 1: Understanding the Graph
- The graph starts at the origin (0 distance from home at 0 seconds), goes up (increasing distance from home), then stays horizontal (constant distance from home), and finally slopes downwards (decreasing distance from home).

## 2: Interpreting the Negative-Sloping Section
- The negative-sloping section of the graph represents Fido getting closer to home because his distance from home decreases over time.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- **A: Fido is walking home.** This option suggests Fido is moving towards his home, which aligns with a decrease in distance from home over time. This is a correct interpretation of the negative-sloping section of the graph.
- **B: Fido has fallen asleep.** There is no indication that Fido's actions (or lack thereof) are directly related to his distance from home in a way that would be represented by a slope on the graph. Falling asleep would likely be represented by a horizontal line (no change in distance over time) if it meant he wasn't moving.
- **C: Fido is accelerating.** Acceleration refers to the rate of change of velocity. A negative slope on a distance-time graph indicates a decrease in distance over time but does not directly imply acceleration without more context on velocity changes.
- **D: Fido is walking away from home.** This option would be represented by an increase in distance from home over time, which corresponds to a positive slope on the graph, not a negative one.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle to interpret graphs and understand the concept of distance over time. They might choose **B: Fido has fallen asleep** (20%) because it seems like a plausible action that could be represented in a non-specific way, **C: Fido is accelerating** (20%) due to confusion with physics concepts, **D: Fido is walking away from home** (30%) because they misinterpret the slope, and **A: Fido is walking home** (30%) if they somewhat understand the graph but not accurately.
- **Basic:** Students here might have a better grasp of graph interpretation. They could choose **A: Fido is walking home** (50%) because it's the most straightforward correct answer, **D: Fido is walking away from home** (20%) due to misunderstanding, **B: Fido has fallen asleep** (15%) for lack of better understanding, and **C: Fido is accelerating** (15%) due to confusion with physics.
- **Proficient:** These students are likely to understand the graph well. They might choose **A: Fido is walking home** (80%) as it's the obvious correct answer, **D: Fido is walking away from home** (10%) for a clear misunderstanding, and **B: Fido has fallen asleep** (5%) and **C: Fido is accelerating** (5%) for less likely misunderstandings.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students should easily understand the graph and its implications. They would likely choose **A: Fido is walking home** (90%) and have low percentages for the other options, possibly **D: Fido is walking away from home** (5%), **B: Fido has fallen asleep** (2%), and **C: Fido is accelerating** (3%).

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%
