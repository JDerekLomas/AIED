## Step 1: Understand the question
The question presents a shape made of a square and a rectangle, with the perimeter of the shape given as \( 30 \mathrm{~cm} \) and the area of the square given as \( 16 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \). The task is to find the area of the entire shape.

## 2: Determine the side length of the square
Given that the area of the square is \( 16 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \), and the formula for the area of a square is side\(^2\), the side length of the square is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 3: Express the perimeter of the shape
The perimeter of the shape is the sum of all its sides. Let's denote the length of the rectangle (assuming it's the longer side) as \( L \) and the width as \( W \). Since the width of the rectangle is shared with one side of the square, \( W = 4 \mathrm{~cm} \). The perimeter \( P \) of the shape can be expressed as \( P = 2L + 4 \times 4 + 2 \times 4 - 2 \times 4 \) (correcting for the shared side and ensuring each side is counted once), simplifying to \( P = 2L + 4 \times 4 \) because the two internal sides of length 4 are not part of the perimeter. However, accurately accounting for all sides gives \( P = L + L + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 2L + 8 + 4 = 2L + 12 \), but correctly it should be seen as \( P = 2L + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 2L + 16 \) for the whole shape including the internal separation.

## 4: Correctly calculate the perimeter equation
Given the perimeter \( P = 30 \mathrm{~cm} \), and correctly identifying the sides, we have \( 30 = 2L + 16 \), simplifying to \( 2L = 14 \), hence \( L = 7 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 5: Calculate the area of the rectangle
The area of the rectangle, \( A_{rect} \), is given by \( L \times W = 7 \times 4 = 28 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \).

## 6: Calculate the total area of the shape
The total area of the shape, \( A_{total} \), is the sum of the area of the square and the rectangle, so \( A_{total} = 16 + 28 = 44 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \).

## 7: Analyze student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the problem, calculating the side of the square, or using the perimeter to find dimensions. They might incorrectly calculate or not understand how to combine shapes. Option A seems too low, B seems plausible if they misunderstand the dimensions, C is the correct answer, and D seems too high. Guesses: A=20% (wild guess), B=30% (misunderstanding), C=30% (getting it right), D=20% (overestimation).
- **Basic**: Students here might understand basic concepts but struggle with applying them correctly or making errors in calculations. They are more likely to get it right but might be tempted by B or D. Guesses: A=5%, B=20%, C=60%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and can apply them accurately. They are likely to get the correct answer. Guesses: A=0%, B=5%, C=90%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level can not only solve the problem accurately but also understand the underlying concepts deeply. They are highly likely to get the correct answer. Guesses: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 8: Finalize predictions
Based on the step-by-step reasoning and understanding of typical student errors and capabilities:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
- **basic**: A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C
