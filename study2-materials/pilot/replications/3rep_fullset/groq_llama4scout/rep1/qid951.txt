To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or challenges students might face.

The question requires students to evaluate the expression \(3 \times 5 + 4 - 2\). To solve it correctly, students must follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right) or BIDMAS in the UK (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction).

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Solution
First, we perform the multiplication: \(3 \times 5 = 15\).
Then, we add 4: \(15 + 4 = 19\).
Finally, we subtract 2: \(19 - 2 = 17\).
So, the correct answer is \(17\), which corresponds to option A.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not following the order of operations correctly, such as adding or subtracting before multiplying. However, in this case, the operation sequence is straightforward: multiplication first, then addition and subtraction from left to right.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(17\) (Correct solution)
- Option B: \(25\) (Could result from \(5 + 4 \times 3 - 2 = 5 + 12 - 2 = 15\), which is incorrect due to wrong order of operations)
- Option C: \(21\) (Could result from \(3 \times 5 + 4 - 2 = 15 + 4 + 2 = 21\), incorrect due to wrong operation)
- Option D: \(9\) (Seems to result from a significant miscalculation)

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
### Below Basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and the order of operations. They might not follow the correct order or make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- A: \(20\%\) (guessing or partially correct calculation)
- B: \(30\%\) (incorrect application of operations)
- C: \(30\%\) (similar incorrect application)
- D: \(20\%\) (completely off)

### Basic
Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in applying the order of operations or in arithmetic.
- A: \(50\%\) (some understanding of order of operations)
- B: \(20\%\) (mistakes in operation order or arithmetic)
- C: \(20\%\) (similar mistakes)
- D: \(10\%\) (significant errors)

### Proficient
These students have a good grasp of the order of operations and arithmetic.
- A: \(80\%\) (correct application of operations)
- B: \(10\%\) (minor mistakes)
- C: \(5\%\) (occasional mistake)
- D: \(5\%\) (rare significant error)

### Advanced
Students at this level are highly confident and accurate in their calculations.
- A: \(95\%\) (strong understanding and accurate calculation)
- B: \(3\%\) (very rare mistake)
- C: \(1\%\) (extremely rare mistake)
- D: \(1\%\) (extremely rare significant error)

The best answer is A.
