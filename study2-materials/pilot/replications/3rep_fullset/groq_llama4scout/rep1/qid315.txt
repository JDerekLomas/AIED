## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to find a correct first step to express the given expression as a single fraction: \( \frac{3}{x-2} - \frac{5}{x} \). This involves finding a common denominator for the fractions.

## 2: Identifying the Common Denominator
The common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{3}{x-2} \) and \( \frac{5}{x} \) is \( x(x-2) \), as \( x \) and \( x-2 \) are distinct and cannot be simplified further.

## 3: Analyzing Option A
Option A suggests \( \frac{3-5}{x-2-x} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{-2}{-2} = 1 \). This option does not correctly represent a step to combine the fractions into a single fraction with a common denominator; it seems to misunderstand the concept of finding a common denominator.

## 4: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( \frac{3(x-2)}{x(x-2)} - \frac{5x}{x(x-2)} \), correctly identifies the common denominator as \( x(x-2) \) and sets up the fractions to be combined. This is a valid first step.

## 5: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( \frac{3x}{x(x-2)} - \frac{5(x-2)}{x(x-2)} \), also correctly identifies the common denominator and sets up the fractions for combination, similar to Option B but with a different arrangement of terms.

## 6: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( 9x - 5(x-2) \), does not relate to finding a common denominator or combining the fractions; it appears to be an incorrect manipulation.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and understanding of fractions. They might be tempted by simple or incorrect options. Option A seems like a simplistic mistake (\( A = 40\% \)), and Option D seems entirely off-track (\( D = 30\% \)). Options B and C are less likely because they require understanding of common denominators (\( B = 15\%, C = 15\% \)).

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of fractions and algebra. They are more likely to recognize the need for a common denominator. Option B and C are strong contenders because they accurately reflect the process (\( B = 40\%, C = 40\% \)). Options A and D are less likely, representing misunderstandings (\( A = 5\%, D = 15\% \)).

- **Proficient**: Students here understand algebraic manipulations well. They should easily identify B and C as correct steps, with a slight preference for one over the other based on systematic approach (\( B = 45\%, C = 45\% \)). A and D are incorrect and less likely (\( A = 5\%, D = 5\% \)).

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand but can also apply concepts efficiently. They would quickly identify B and C as correct, with perhaps a slight inclination towards the more systematic or commonly taught method (\( B = 50\%, C = 50\% \)). A and D would be seen as incorrect (\( A = 0\%, D = 0\% \)).

## 8: Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% B=15% C=15% D=30%
- **Basic**: A=5% B=40% C=40% D=15%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=45% C=45% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=50% C=50% D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=15% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=40% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=45% C=45% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=50% C=50% D=0%
