To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with solving quadratic equations.

The equation given is \((5x + 2)(2x - 5) = 0\). This equation can be solved by setting each factor equal to zero:
1. \(5x + 2 = 0\) gives \(5x = -2\), hence \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\).
2. \(2x - 5 = 0\) gives \(2x = 5\), hence \(x = \frac{5}{2}\).

## Step 1: Identify the correct solutions
The correct solutions to the equation are \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\) and \(x = \frac{5}{2}\).

## 2: Analyze Tom's solution
Tom says one solution is \(x = \frac{2}{5}\). This does not match either of the correct solutions.

## 3: Analyze Katie's solution
Katie says one solution is \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\). This also does not match either of the correct solutions.

## 4: Determine the correctness of Tom and Katie's statements
- Tom's solution, \(x = \frac{2}{5}\), is incorrect because it doesn't solve the equation.
- Katie's solution, \(x = -\frac{5}{2}\), is also incorrect for the same reason.

## 5: Assess common misconceptions and difficulty
A common misconception might involve incorrectly solving for \(x\) or misinterpreting the solutions. However, this question is straightforward in that it directly asks who is correct based on given solutions, not requiring the students to solve the equation themselves but to validate given solutions.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and could easily be misled by incorrect solutions or fail to identify the correct method to validate Tom and Katie's claims. They might choose randomly or based on a misunderstanding of how to solve the equation. 
  - A: XX% 
  - B: XX% 
  - C: XX% 
  - D: XX%

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make simple algebraic errors or not fully understand how to apply the zero product property correctly. They might identify one or both as incorrect but could struggle with articulating why or might mistakenly validate an incorrect solution.
  
- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of algebra and should easily identify that both Tom and Katie provided solutions that do not satisfy the equation. They understand the zero product property and can solve for \(x\).
  
- **Advanced**: These students not only solve the equation correctly but also understand the implications of the solutions in the context of the question. They will easily identify Tom and Katie's solutions as incorrect.

Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:
- A correct approach yields \(x = -\frac{2}{5}\) or \(x = \frac{5}{2}\), meaning both Tom and Katie are incorrect.

## 7: Assign percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50% (Many struggle, but significant numbers might pick D due to frustration or lack of understanding)
- **Basic**: A=15% B=15% C=10% D=60% (Understanding improves, but errors in logic or calculation persist)
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85% (Most can accurately assess the solutions)
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100% (All understand the correct assessment)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=10% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
