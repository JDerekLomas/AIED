## Step 1: Understand the question and the content it tests
The question asks students to factorize the quadratic expression \(p^{2}+2p+3\). This involves finding two numbers that multiply to 3 and add to 2, or determining if such numbers exist.

## 2: Identify the nature of the quadratic expression
The given expression is \(p^{2}+2p+3\). To factorize it, we look for two numbers that multiply to 3 (the constant term) and add to 2 (the coefficient of \(p\)). However, there are no real numbers that satisfy this condition because the factors of 3 are (1, 3) and (-1, -3), and neither pair adds up to 2.

## 3: Consider common misconceptions and student errors
A common misconception might involve students trying to factor the quadratic expression without checking if it's factorable. For expressions that are easily factorable, like \(p^{2}+5p+6\), students might quickly find factors. However, for expressions like \(p^{2}+2p+3\), which do not factor easily over the integers, students might struggle or incorrectly apply factorization techniques.

## 4: Analyze the difficulty of the question
This question might seem straightforward to students who understand that not all quadratic expressions can be easily factorized into integers or simple fractions. The key here is recognizing that \(p^{2}+2p+3\) does not have obvious integer roots (since the discriminant \(b^{2}-4ac = 2^{2} - 4(1)(3) = 4 - 12 = -8\) is negative, indicating complex roots), which implies it cannot be factored into linear factors with real coefficients.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand factorization or might incorrectly try to factor by finding any two numbers that add to 2 and multiply to 3, which could lead to random guesses. They might choose A, B, or C if they mistakenly think it factors nicely. D might be chosen if they recognize it doesn't factor easily but aren't confident. Expected distribution: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors. They might try simple factor pairs or use trial and error, leading to some choosing A, B, or C. However, a higher percentage than below_basic might recognize it doesn't factor. Expected distribution: A=20% B=20% C=15% D=45%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand factorization well and can identify when a quadratic expression does not factor easily over the integers. They are likely to recognize that \(p^{2}+2p+3\) has no real roots that are simple integers or fractions, thus choosing D. Expected distribution: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident in their algebraic skills. They will quickly determine the expression does not factor into linear factors with real coefficients and choose D. Expected distribution: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%.

## 6: Provide the distribution in the required format
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
- basic: A=20% B=20% C=15% D=45%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=15% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
