To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's first analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it might pose.

The question provides that \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( A \) is \( 12 \), and asks for \( \frac{1}{2} \) of \( A \). 

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
To solve this, students first need to find \( A \) by reversing the operation given: if \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( A \) is \( 12 \), then \( A = 12 \times 3 = 36 \).

## 2: Calculating \( \frac{1}{2} \) of \( A \)
Once \( A = 36 \) is found, \( \frac{1}{2} \) of \( A \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 36 = 18 \).

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusion with the operations or fractions, but given the straightforward nature of this problem, the main challenge could be in understanding and applying the relationship between \( \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \frac{1}{2} \) of \( A \) correctly.

## 4: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A: \( 2 \) seems too low and doesn't relate to simple calculations from \( 12 \) or \( 36 \).
- Option B: \( 8 \) doesn't directly relate to \( 12 \) or \( 36 \) through simple fraction operations.
- Option C: \( 36 \) is the value of \( A \) itself, not \( \frac{1}{2} \) of \( A \).
- Option D: \( 18 \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \) of \( 36 \), which is the correct answer.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic fraction concepts and operations. They might choose A or B due to a lack of understanding of how to manipulate fractions and find \( A \), or they might incorrectly calculate. However, without a clear pathway to A or B from the given information, and considering the simplicity of the calculation once \( A \) is known, some might guess or incorrectly calculate, leading to:
  - A: 10%
  - B: 10%
  - C: 40% (as it directly relates to the given equation)
  - D: 40%

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple errors. They are more likely to calculate \( A \) correctly but then might struggle with \( \frac{1}{2} \) of \( A \):
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 20%
  - D: 70%

- **Proficient:** These students understand fractions and can apply them. They are likely to get it right:
  - A: 1%
  - B: 1%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 93%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand but can apply concepts quickly and accurately. Errors would be minimal:
  - A: 0%
  - B: 0%
  - C: 2%
  - D: 98%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=40% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=20% D=70%
proficient: A=1% B=1% C=5% D=93%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=2% D=98%
