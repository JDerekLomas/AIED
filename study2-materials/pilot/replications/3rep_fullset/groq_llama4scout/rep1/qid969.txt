To approach this question, let's analyze the potential misconceptions and the actual mathematical operations required.

The question asks students to compare two temperatures: \( -7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) and \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). The correct comparison involves understanding that temperature differences are calculated by subtraction.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
To determine which statement is true, students need to calculate the difference between \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) and \( -7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). This can be done by subtracting \( -7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) from \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \), which gives \( 5 - (-7) = 5 + 7 = 12^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \).

## 2: Interpreting the Results
The calculation \( 5 - (-7) = 12 \) indicates that \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 12^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) hotter than \( -7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). Therefore, the correct answer is D: \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 12^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) hotter than \( -7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect handling of negative numbers or misunderstanding the concept of "hotter" and "colder." For instance, some students might mistakenly calculate the difference or misinterpret the direction of the comparison (hotter vs. colder).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with basic arithmetic operations involving negative numbers. They might incorrectly calculate the difference or confuse "hotter" and "colder." 
  - A: Incorrect calculation leading to choosing an option that suggests a small difference.
  - B: Incorrectly stating \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is colder by a small margin.
  - C: Might seem plausible if students misunderstand "hotter" and "colder" but calculate a small difference.
  - D: The correct answer, but let's assume a lower percentage get it right due to difficulties with negative numbers and understanding temperature differences.

- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a better grasp of arithmetic but might still struggle with the conceptual understanding of temperature comparisons.
  - A: \( 10\% \) (might incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the concept)
  - B: \( 20\% \) (similarly misguided)
  - C: \( 15\% \) (conceptual confusion)
  - D: \( 55\% \) (getting it right as they understand basic calculations)

- **Proficient:** These students are expected to handle calculations confidently and understand conceptual differences.
  - A: \( 5\% \) (minor calculation errors)
  - B: \( 5\% \) (misunderstanding)
  - C: \( 5\% \) (similar)
  - D: \( 85\% \) (accurately calculate and understand)

- **Advanced:** Students here are expected to not only calculate accurately but also to reason abstractly about the question.
  - A: \( 0\% \) (unlikely to make basic errors)
  - B: \( 0\% \) (similarly unlikely)
  - C: \( 0\% \) (conceptually sound)
  - D: \( 100\% \) (no errors expected)

The best answer is D. 

Given the analysis, here's a prediction:

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=10% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
