To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and the nature of the options provided. The question asks for the first cube number greater than 100. Cube numbers are numbers raised to the power of 3, such as \(1^3 = 1\), \(2^3 = 8\), \(3^3 = 27\), \(4^3 = 64\), \(5^3 = 125\), and so on.

## Step 1: Understanding Cube Numbers
The sequence of cube numbers starts as 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, etc. We need to find the first cube number greater than 100.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Answer
From the sequence, \(4^3 = 64\) which is less than 100, and \(5^3 = 125\) which is greater than 100. Therefore, the first cube number greater than 100 is \(125\), which corresponds to option B.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Difficulty
This question tests the understanding of cube numbers and the ability to calculate or recall them. A common misconception might involve confusing cube numbers with square numbers or simply not being familiar with the sequence of cube numbers. However, given that cube numbers up to \(5^3\) are relatively well-known and \(125\) is a number that many students might recall or easily calculate, the question seems straightforward.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand what a cube number is or how to calculate it. They might guess or choose an option that seems "close" to 100 or simply pick a number without calculation. Option A (\(103\)) could be appealing as it's just above 100 but not a perfect cube. Option D (\(102\)) is also close to 100 but not a cube. \(121\) could be considered as it's a square number (\(11^2\)), and some might confuse properties of numbers. However, without a strong understanding, guesses might be spread across options.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question for those who know cube numbers, but considering potential confusion or lack of knowledge:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (guessing close numbers), B=20% (some might know or guess this), C=20% (confusing with square numbers), D=30% (random guess).
- **Basic:** A=10% (unlikely to choose a non-cube), B=70% (likely to know or figure out \(5^3\)), C=10% (might confuse with square), D=10% (might guess).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (very unlikely), B=90% (should know \(5^3 = 125\)), C=3% (unlikely confusion), D=2% (unlikely guess).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (would know), B=95% (certain), C=0% (no confusion expected), D=5% (extremely unlikely but could be a deliberate check).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
