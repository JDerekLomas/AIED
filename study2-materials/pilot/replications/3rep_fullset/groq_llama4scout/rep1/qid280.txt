To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question presents a trapezium with two lines marked, which are stated to be parallel sides. The options provided are:

A: Perpendicular
B: Vertical
C: Equal
D: Parallel

The correct answer is D: Parallel, as the question directly states that the lines marked are parallel sides.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question is straightforward and directly related to the definition of a trapezium and the properties of its sides. A trapezium is a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
- **Perpendicular (A):** This would imply that the lines intersect at a 90-degree angle, which is not indicated or implied by the statement that they are parallel.
- **Vertical (B):** This option might confuse students if they mistakenly associate "vertical" with a specific orientation or property, but it doesn't directly relate to the parallel nature of the sides.
- **Equal (C):** While in some quadrilaterals (like a parallelogram or a square), parallel sides are equal in length, the question does not ask about length, and it's not a property that defines parallel lines.
- **Parallel (D):** This is the correct definition of the marked lines according to the question.

## 3: Analyzing by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic geometric terms. They might confuse properties like "perpendicular," "vertical," and "parallel." Given the direct statement, but potentially lacking understanding of geometric terms, they might be inclined to choose an obviously incorrect option or one that sounds plausible but isn't. **A=30%**, **B=20%**, **C=20%**, **D=30%**
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a foundational understanding of geometric shapes but might still be prone to simple misconceptions. They are more likely to understand basic properties but may get confused with terms. **A=10%**, **B=10%**, **C=15%**, **D=65%**
- **Proficient:** Students here have a solid grasp of geometric concepts, including properties of trapeziums. They are less likely to confuse basic properties. **A=5%**, **B=5%**, **C=5%**, **D=85%**
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand but can apply and analyze geometric properties. They are highly unlikely to choose incorrect options. **A=0%**, **B=0%**, **C=0%**, **D=100%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=15% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
