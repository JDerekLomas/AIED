## Step 1: Understand the question
The question requires students to simplify the given algebraic fraction: \( \frac{q^{2}+q-12}{q^{2}-2 q-3} \). To simplify, students need to factor both the numerator and denominator.

## 2: Factor the numerator and denominator
The numerator \( q^{2}+q-12 \) can be factored into \( (q+4)(q-3) \) and the denominator \( q^{2}-2 q-3 \) can be factored into \( (q-3)(q+1) \).

## 3: Simplify the fraction
After factoring, the fraction becomes \( \frac{(q+4)(q-3)}{(q-3)(q+1)} \). Students should then cancel out the common factor \( (q-3) \) from the numerator and denominator, yielding \( \frac{q+4}{q+1} \), provided \( q \neq 3 \) to avoid division by zero.

## 4: Analyze the options
- Option A: \( \frac{q-4}{q-1} \)
- Option B: \( \frac{q+4}{q+1} \)
- Option C: \( \frac{q-4}{-2 q-1} \)
- Option D: \( 4 \)

## 5: Consider common misconceptions and errors
A common error might be not fully factoring or incorrectly cancelling terms. However, given the straightforward nature of the factoring here, the main challenge is likely to be in ensuring the correct cancellation and not introducing errors.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with factoring and simplifying. They might not factor correctly or might not cancel terms properly. They could choose A, C, or D due to misfactoring or incorrect simplification. Let's assume B might be chosen by 20% who somehow manage to get it right despite being below basic, A by 30%, C by 30%, and D by 20%.
- **Basic:** Students here should have a better grasp of basic algebra. They might still make some errors in factoring or cancelling, but they are more likely to choose B. Let's assume 60% choose B, 20% choose A, 10% choose C, and 10% choose D.
- **Proficient:** These students are likely to factor and simplify correctly. They should choose B with high accuracy. Let's assume 85% choose B, 5% choose A, 5% choose C, and 5% choose D.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to handle algebraic manipulations with ease. They should uniformly choose B. Let's assume 95% choose B, with the remaining 5% split among A, C, or D due to careless errors.

## 7: Assign percentages
Based on the consideration of algebraic skills and common errors:
- **below_basic:** A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- **basic:** A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced:** A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
