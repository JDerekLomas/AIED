## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to find where the curve \( y=(x-3)(x-5) \) intercepts the \( x \) axis. To find \( x \) intercepts, students need to set \( y=0 \) and solve for \( x \). This is a fundamental concept in algebra and graphing.

## 2: Solving the Equation
Setting \( y=0 \) gives \( 0=(x-3)(x-5) \). Using the zero product property, students find \( x=3 \) or \( x=5 \). Therefore, the curve intercepts the \( x \) axis at \( (3,0) \) and \( (5,0) \).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( (3,5) \) - Incorrect because it does not represent \( x \) intercepts but rather a point in the coordinate plane.
- Option B: \( \begin{array}{c}(3,0) \\ \text { and } \\ (5,0)\end{array} \) - Correct, as it accurately represents the \( x \) intercepts.
- Option C: \( \begin{array}{c}(-3,0) \\ \text { and } \\ (-5,0)\end{array} \) - Incorrect, suggesting a misunderstanding of how to solve for \( x \) intercepts.
- Option D: \( \begin{array}{c}(3,5) \\ \text { and } \\ (-3,-5)\end{array} \) - Incorrect, indicating confusion with both \( x \) intercepts and possibly the form of the equation.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of \( x \) intercepts and solving quadratic equations. They might choose A or D due to confusion, but a significant portion might also choose C, showing a lack of understanding of how to find \( x \) intercepts. B might be chosen by a few who recall the method but don't apply it correctly. 
  - A: 20% (misinterpreting intercepts), B: 10% (correct but struggling), C: 40% (incorrectly solving), D: 30% (completely misunderstanding).

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to choose B but could be tempted by A or C due to oversight.
  - A: 5%, B: 80%, C: 10%, D: 5%.

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and are less likely to make errors. They should predominantly choose B.
  - A: 1%, B: 95%, C: 2%, D: 2%.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately. They should choose B without hesitation.
  - A: 0%, B: 99%, C: 0.5%, D: 0.5%.

## 5: Formatting the Response
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
- basic: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
- proficient: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
- advanced: A=0% B=99% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=99% C=0.5% D=0.5%
