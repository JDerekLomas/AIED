To approach this question, let's consider the common misconceptions and the mathematical operations involved.

## Step 1: Understanding the Operations
The question involves two mathematical problems: \( (4+5)^{2} \) and \( 4+5^{2} \). The first problem requires adding 4 and 5, then squaring the result. The second problem requires squaring 5, then adding 4.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception among students is not following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). For problem P, \( (4+5)^{2} \), the correct order is to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first, then square the result. For problem Q, \( 4+5^{2} \), the correct order is to evaluate the exponent first, then perform the addition.

## 3: Analyzing Problem P
In problem P, \( (4+5)^{2} \), the parentheses indicate that \( 4+5 \) should be calculated first, which is a clear and straightforward instruction. Most students, regardless of their ability level, should recognize that the operation inside the parentheses takes precedence.

## 4: Analyzing Problem Q
In problem Q, \( 4+5^{2} \), there are no parentheses, so the order of operations dictates that the exponentiation (\( 5^{2} \)) should be evaluated before the addition.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the order of operations. They might incorrectly think that for both problems, they should do the operations as they appear from left to right or might not understand the significance of parentheses and exponents. So, they might choose A (Problem P: \( 4+5 \), Problem Q: \( 4+5 \)) or B (Problem P: \( 4+5 \), Problem Q: \( 5^{2} \)) because they recognize the parentheses in Problem P but not correctly apply the order of operations in Problem Q.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a better grasp of basic mathematical operations and the order of operations. They should correctly identify that for Problem P, \( 4+5 \) should be done first, and for Problem Q, \( 5^{2} \) should be done first. Thus, they are likely to choose B.
- **Proficient:** These students are familiar with and apply the order of operations correctly. They should easily choose B, as it correctly states that for Problem P, \( 4+5 \) should be done first (because of the parentheses), and for Problem Q, \( 5^{2} \) should be done first.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand but can also apply the order of operations in complex situations. They would also choose B, as it accurately reflects the correct order of operations for both problems.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (not understanding the order of operations), B=30% (some understanding but might mix up), C=10% (unlikely), D=20% (confused about both).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=70%, C=5%, D=15%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=90%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced:** A=2%, B=95%, C=1%, D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
