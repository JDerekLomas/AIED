## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a final stage of solving a quadratic equation in the form of \((h+4)(h-3)=0\), leading to solutions \(h = \bigstar\) or \(h = 3\). The task is to find the value that should replace the star.

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
The equation given is a quadratic equation in its factored form. The solutions to such an equation are found by setting each factor equal to zero. Therefore, for \((h+4)(h-3)=0\), we set \(h+4=0\) and \(h-3=0\), yielding \(h=-4\) and \(h=3\), respectively.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Errors
A common misconception might involve incorrectly solving for \(h\) or misinterpreting the equation. However, given that one solution is already provided (\(h=3\)), and the equation is straightforward, the main task is to solve \(h+4=0\), which gives \(h=-4\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not recognize the equation form or could incorrectly solve for \(h\). Given the simplicity of solving \(h+4=0\), a significant portion might still get it wrong due to a lack of basic algebraic understanding. So, \(A=10\%\), \(B=60\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=10\%\).
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding of algebra. They should be able to solve \(h+4=0\) to get \(h=-4\). However, some might confuse the process or make calculation errors. Thus, \(A=5\%\), \(B=80\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=5\%\).
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of algebraic concepts, including solving quadratic equations in factored form. They should easily identify \(h=-4\) as the missing solution. So, \(A=2\%\), \(B=90\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=3\%\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand but can also apply algebraic concepts efficiently. They are likely to get the question correct without hesitation. Hence, \(A=1\%\), \(B=95\%\), \(C=3\%\), \(D=1\%\).
