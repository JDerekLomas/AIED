## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to expand the expression \(6(2-3p)\). This is a straightforward application of the distributive property in algebra.

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
A common misconception students might have is applying the multiplication incorrectly, either by not distributing the 6 to both terms inside the parentheses or by making errors in the arithmetic.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(8-18p\)
- Option B: \(2-18p\)
- Option C: \(12-18p\)
- Option D: \(18p-6\)

## 4: Correct Expansion
The correct expansion of \(6(2-3p)\) is:
\[6 \times 2 - 6 \times 3p = 12 - 18p\]
So, the correct answer is Option C: \(12-18p\).

## 5: Predicting Student Errors
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic and applying the distributive property. They might incorrectly distribute or perform arithmetic operations. Option D (\(18p-6\)) could be a result of incorrectly applying the distributive property or reversing the operations. Options A and B might result from incorrect arithmetic. Given the simplicity of the numbers, even below-basic students might have a chance at getting it right if they remember the distributive property.
- **Basic**: Students here should be familiar with the distributive property but might make arithmetic mistakes. They are likely to get it wrong if they miscalculate \(6 \times 2\) or \(6 \times 3p\). Option C should be within their reach if they apply the property correctly.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to apply the distributive property correctly and perform the arithmetic accurately. They should mostly choose Option C.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should easily and accurately expand the expression, choosing Option C.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (simple addition/subtraction mistake), B=15% (possibly incorrect distribution and arithmetic), C=40% (getting it right or simple guess), D=25% (reversing operations or severe arithmetic mistake).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5% (most should get it right with some minor errors).
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=2%, C=92%, D=1% (most get it right).
- **Advanced**: A=2%, B=1%, C=96%, D=1% (almost all get it right).

## 7: Finalizing Predictions
Given the analysis, the predictions can be summarized as follows:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=92% D=1%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=96% D=1%
