## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question requires students to expand and simplify the expression \((p-5)(p+2)\) and then compare it to \(p^{2} \triangle p \bigcirc\) to find the value that should replace the circle (\(\bigcirc\)).

## 2: Expand and Simplify the Given Expression
To expand \((p-5)(p+2)\), we use the FOIL method:
\((p-5)(p+2) = p \cdot p + p \cdot 2 - 5 \cdot p - 5 \cdot 2\)
\(= p^{2} + 2p - 5p - 10\)
\(= p^{2} - 3p - 10\).

## 3: Compare with the Given Form
The expression is now \(p^{2} - 3p - 10\), and we need to match it with \(p^{2} \triangle p \bigcirc\). This implies that \(\triangle = -3\) (coefficient of \(p\)) and \(\bigcirc = -10\) (constant term).

## 4: Analyze Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve errors in expanding the brackets or in identifying the coefficients and constant term. However, the structure of this question directly tests the ability to identify the constant term after expansion.

## 5: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the algebra, possibly confusing the operations or forgetting to distribute. They might not correctly identify \(\bigcirc\). Expect a significant spread across options due to lack of understanding.
- **Basic:** Students here should have a grasp of basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to understand the expansion but could confuse the signs or operations.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily expand and simplify the expression, correctly identifying \(\bigcirc = -10\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should not only correctly solve the problem but also understand the structure of algebraic expressions and potentially see through common misconceptions.

## 6: Estimate Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the expansion and the fact that it directly tests a specific skill:
- **Below Basic:** A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30% (Many might guess or misunderstand).
- **Basic:** A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15% (Most would get it right or mistakenly choose a plausible incorrect answer).
- **Proficient:** A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3% (Most would correctly identify \(\bigcirc = -10\)).
- **Advanced:** A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2% (Almost all would get it right).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%
