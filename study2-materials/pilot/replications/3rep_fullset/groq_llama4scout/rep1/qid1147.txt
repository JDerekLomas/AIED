To approach this question, let's consider the common misconceptions and the ease with which students might recall trigonometric values for special angles.

The trigonometric value for \( \tan(30^\circ) \) is a standard value that students learn in GCSE mathematics. The exact value of \( \tan(30^\circ) \) is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \), which can also be expressed as \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \) by rationalizing the denominator.

## Step 1: Understanding the Options
- Option A: \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \) is the correct value for \( \tan(30^\circ) \).
- Option B: \( \sqrt{3} \) is the value for \( \tan(60^\circ) \), not \( \tan(30^\circ) \).
- Option C: \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) is the value for \( \sin(60^\circ) \) or \( \cos(30^\circ) \), not \( \tan(30^\circ) \).
- Option D: \( \frac{1}{2} \) is the value for \( \sin(30^\circ) \), not \( \tan(30^\circ) \).

## 2: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to recall trigonometric identities and values. They might confuse \( \tan(30^\circ) \) with \( \sin(30^\circ) \) or \( \cos(30^\circ) \), so they could choose D (20-30%), or they might not know the correct formula and choose randomly. Option A is likely to be chosen by a small percentage (10-20%) as it requires specific recall. 
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding and might recall that \( \tan(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \) but struggle with the rationalized form. They might still confuse it with other trigonometric ratios. So, A could be around 40-50%, with B, C, and D taking the rest, each around 15-20%.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to know the exact value of \( \tan(30^\circ) \) and be able to express it as \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \). Therefore, A should be around 80-90%, with minimal selection of other options.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only know the value but can also derive it. They are highly likely to choose A (95-100%), as the question does not pose a challenge to them.

## 3: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=10%, B=20%, C=20%, D=50%
- **Basic**: A=50%, B=20%, C=15%, D=15%
- **Proficient**: A=90%, B=5%, C=4%, D=1%
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=1%, D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=20% D=50%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
