## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem provides a rectangle with an area of \(8 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\), a base of \(x\), and a height of \(x^2 + 9\). The area of a rectangle is given by base times height, so we have \(x(x^2 + 9) = 8\). This equation needs to be solved for \(x\), and Sally uses an iterative method: \(x_{n+1}=\frac{8}{9}-\frac{x^{3}_{n}}{9}\).

## 2: Identify the equation to solve
The equation to solve is \(x(x^2 + 9) = 8\), which simplifies to \(x^3 + 9x - 8 = 0\). This is a cubic equation.

## 3: Consider the iterative method
Sally's method is \(x_{n+1}=\frac{8}{9}-\frac{x^{3}_{n}}{9}\). To find \(x\) given \(x_0 = 0\), we substitute \(x_0\) into the equation to find \(x_1\), and continue iteratively until convergence to 3 decimal places.

## 4: Calculate \(x_1\)
Given \(x_0 = 0\), \(x_1 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{0^3}{9} = \frac{8}{9} \approx 0.889\).

## 5: Calculate \(x_2\)
Using \(x_1 = 0.889\), \(x_2 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{0.889^3}{9}\). Calculating \(0.889^3 \approx 0.702\), so \(x_2 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{0.702}{9} \approx 0.888 - 0.078 = 0.810\).

## 6: Calculate \(x_3\)
Using \(x_2 = 0.810\), \(x_3 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{0.810^3}{9}\). Calculating \(0.810^3 \approx 0.531\), so \(x_3 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{0.531}{9} \approx 0.889 - 0.059 = 0.830\).

## 7: Calculate \(x_4\)
Using \(x_3 = 0.830\), \(x_4 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{0.830^3}{9}\). Calculating \(0.830^3 \approx 0.571\), so \(x_4 = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{0.571}{9} \approx 0.889 - 0.0635 = 0.8255\).

## 8: Determine convergence
Continuing this process, we find that the value converges to approximately \(0.826\) to \(3\) decimal places.

## 9: Evaluate student performance
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the iterative process and solving the cubic equation directly. They might not understand how to apply the iterative formula or could get confused with the calculations. Option A (\(0.826\)) seems closest to a correct calculation but might be hard for them to derive directly. Expect a spread across options but with a higher chance of incorrect answers. 
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the iterative process but could make calculation errors. They might get close but not exactly \(0.826\), potentially selecting B or C due to minor calculation discrepancies. 
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately apply the iterative method and reach \(0.826\) or very close, likely selecting A or C if their calculations slightly differ but still converge to a similar value.
- **Advanced**: These students are expected to accurately solve or closely approximate the value through the iterative method or other means, likely selecting the closest correct answer.

## 10: Assign percentages
Given the calculations and expected student understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40% (struggling with the method and calculations)
- **Basic**: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20% (can attempt the method but might make errors)
- **Proficient**: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5% (accurately apply the method, minor errors)
- **Advanced**: A=80% B=10% C=10% D=0% (accurately solve with minimal errors)

The best answer is A.
