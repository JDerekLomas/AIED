To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the characteristics of an exponential function and the given graphs.

An exponential function typically has a horizontal asymptote (often the x-axis) and increases or decreases rapidly. The graph of an exponential function does not have a maximum or minimum point (except for a horizontal asymptote), and it does not change direction more than once.

- **Graph A** depicts a curve that starts just above the x-axis, increases gradually at first, and then more steeply. This graph shows continuous increase without bound and seems to have a characteristic of exponential growth, where the function starts slowly and then increases more rapidly.

- **Graph B** shows two curves in different quadrants, with each curve decreasing and then leveling off. This could resemble the behavior of functions with asymptotes but does not clearly depict a simple exponential function.

- **Graph C** presents a curve that decreases, then increases to the origin, and decreases again. This graph does not represent an exponential function due to its behavior of turning around.

- **Graph D** illustrates an upside-down symmetrical U shape. This doesn't resemble an exponential function, as exponential functions do not turn back on themselves.

Considering the properties of exponential functions:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle to distinguish between types of functions. 
  - A=40% (as it shows growth, a concept they might associate with exponential functions)
  - B=20% (could be confused with growth/decay but seems less likely)
  - C=20% (the turning could mislead)
  - D=20% (the symmetry could confuse)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but may not fully recognize the implications of exponential growth.
  - A=60% (recognizing the continuous increase)
  - B=15% (less likely due to complexity)
  - C=10% (too complex with turning points)
  - D=15% (symmetry not characteristic)

- **Proficient:** These students are familiar with exponential functions and their graphs.
  - A=80% (clearly representative of exponential growth)
  - B=5% (unlikely due to the shape)
  - C=5% (turning points eliminate it)
  - D=10% (not characteristic)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and are less likely to make errors.
  - A=90% (matches the growth profile well)
  - B=0% (does not match)
  - C=0% (characteristics not aligned)
  - D=10% (very unlikely)

Therefore, the predicted percentages are:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
