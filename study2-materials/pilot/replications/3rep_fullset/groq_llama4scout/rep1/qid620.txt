## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks students to reflect a point \( \mathrm{C} \) across the line \( x = 4 \) and find the new coordinates of \( \mathrm{C} \). The original coordinates of \( \mathrm{C} \) are not directly provided, but based on the graph, we can infer them. Given the context, let's assume \( \mathrm{C} \) is at \( (2, 5) \) as it's the only point provided in the options and seems to relate to a simple reflection.

## 2: Reflection across \( x = 4 \)
To reflect a point across \( x = 4 \), we find the horizontal distance of the point from the line \( x = 4 \) and then move the same distance to the other side of \( x = 4 \). If \( \mathrm{C} \) is at \( (2, 5) \), it is \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) units to the left of \( x = 4 \). So, the reflected point will be \( 2 \) units to the right of \( x = 4 \), which places it at \( x = 4 + 2 = 6 \).

## 3: Determine the new coordinates
The \( y \)-coordinate does not change during a reflection across a vertical line. Therefore, if \( \mathrm{C} \) is originally at \( (2, 5) \), after reflection across \( x = 4 \), \( \mathrm{C} \) will be at \( (6, 5) \). However, this option is not provided, so we need to assess the given options.

## 4: Assess the options
- A: \( (3, 5) \) - Incorrect, as it's not the reflection of \( (2, 5) \) across \( x = 4 \).
- B: \( (6, 3) \) - Incorrect, because the \( y \)-coordinate changes, which shouldn't happen in a reflection across a vertical line.
- C: \( (4, 5) \) - Incorrect, as it doesn't account for the movement across \( x = 4 \).
- D: \( (2, 5) \) - Incorrect, as it suggests no change.

## 5: Analyze potential misconceptions
A common misconception could be changing the \( y \)-coordinate or not correctly calculating the reflection point. Students might also confuse the line of reflection or not apply the concept of reflection correctly.

## 6: Estimate student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle with understanding reflections or calculating distances. They could mistakenly choose \( \mathrm{A} \), \( \mathrm{C} \), or \( \mathrm{D} \) due to not fully grasping the concept. \( \mathrm{A} = 30\% \), \( \mathrm{B} = 20\% \), \( \mathrm{C} = 20\% \), \( \mathrm{D} = 30\% \).
- **Basic**: Students understand basic geometric transformations but might make calculation errors. They are likely to eliminate \( \mathrm{D} \) but could be unsure between \( \mathrm{A} \), \( \mathrm{B} \), and \( \mathrm{C} \). \( \mathrm{A} = 20\% \), \( \mathrm{B} = 40\% \), \( \mathrm{C} = 30\% \), \( \mathrm{D} = 10\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately reflect the point. Given \( \mathrm{B} \) isn't correct based on our calculation but seems like a plausible mistake, they might still choose it or realize the correct answer isn't listed. \( \mathrm{A} = 5\% \), \( \mathrm{B} = 20\% \), \( \mathrm{C} = 10\% \), \( \mathrm{D} = 65\% \) (or another distribution acknowledging the error in provided solutions).
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to spot any mistakes in provided options and understand the reflection perfectly. If they notice \( (6,5) \) isn't an option, they might choose \( \mathrm{B} \) due to its proximity or logic error. \( \mathrm{A} = 0\% \), \( \mathrm{B} = 5\% \), \( \mathrm{C} = 5\% \), \( \mathrm{D} = 90\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=20% C=10% D=65%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=5% D=90%
