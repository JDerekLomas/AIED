## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests.
The question tests the understanding of the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) in the equation \(y = x^2 - 1\). Specifically, it checks if students can solve for \(x\) given \(y\), and if they recognize that \(x\) can have two values (positive and negative) for a given \(y\).

## 2: Determine the solution to the given problem.
To verify Tom and Katie's claims, we substitute \(y = 15\) into the equation \(y = x^2 - 1\), which gives \(15 = x^2 - 1\). Solving for \(x^2\), we get \(x^2 = 16\). Therefore, \(x = \pm 4\), which means both Tom and Katie are correct.

## 3: Analyze the potential for errors based on student ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with solving the equation for \(x\) or might not fully understand the concept of \(x^2\) having two solutions. They might incorrectly solve the equation or not recognize that \(x\) can be both positive and negative. Expect a high percentage to choose D) Neither is correct or possibly A) Only Tom if they mistakenly think only positive values are considered.

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in solving the quadratic equation or in interpreting the results. They are more likely to recognize that there could be two solutions but might not accurately solve for \(x\). A significant percentage might choose C) Both Tom and Katie if they understand the symmetry of \(x^2\), but some might still opt for A or B.

- **Proficient:** These students should be able to accurately solve \(x^2 = 16\) and understand that \(x\) can be \(4\) or \(-4\). They are likely to choose C) Both Tom and Katie, with a small percentage possibly choosing A or B due to minor calculation errors or misunderstandings.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of quadratic equations and their graphs. They will easily solve for \(x\) and understand the implications of \(x^2\) having two roots. They are expected to choose C) Both Tom and Katie with a very high confidence.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option.
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic:** A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The best answer is 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
