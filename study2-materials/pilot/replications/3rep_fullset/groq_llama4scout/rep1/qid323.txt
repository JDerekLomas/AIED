## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to factorise the quadratic expression \( x^{2}+15 x+36 \). This involves finding two numbers that multiply to 36 and add up to 15.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Factorisation
To factorise \( x^{2}+15 x+36 \), we look for two numbers that add up to 15 and multiply to 36. These numbers are 3 and 12 because \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) and \( 3 + 12 = 15 \). Therefore, the correct factorisation is \( (x+3)(x+12) \).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Errors
- Option A: \( (x+4)(x+9) \) suggests numbers that add up to 13 and multiply to 36, which is incorrect for this expression.
- Option C: \( (x+1)(x+36) \) suggests numbers that add up to 37 and multiply to 36, which is also incorrect.
- Option D: \( (x+7)(x+18) \) suggests numbers that add up to 25 and multiply to 126, which is incorrect for this expression.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and factorisation. They might not even attempt to factorise or could guess randomly. Given the options, B seems more plausible as it at least involves numbers close to the correct factors, but errors in calculation or understanding of factorisation are common. \( A=10\% \), \( B=20\% \), \( C=30\% \), \( D=40\% \).
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are more likely to attempt factorisation but could get confused. The correct answer, B, should be within their reach, but some might be tempted by A or D due to miscalculation. \( A=5\% \), \( B=60\% \), \( C=20\% \), \( D=15\% \).
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of algebraic techniques, including factorisation. They are likely to quickly identify the correct factors. \( A=2\% \), \( B=90\% \), \( C=5\% \), \( D=3\% \).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand how to factorise but can also do it efficiently and accurately. They are highly likely to choose the correct option without hesitation. \( A=1\% \), \( B=95\% \), \( C=2\% \), \( D=2\% \).

## 5: Final Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
- basic: A=5% B=60% C=20% D=15%
- proficient: A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%
- advanced: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=60% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
