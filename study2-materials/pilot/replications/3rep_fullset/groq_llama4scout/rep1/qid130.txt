## Step 1: Analyze the sequence given to understand its pattern.
The sequence provided is \(6, 14, 28, 48, 74, \ldots\). To identify the pattern, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms: \(14 - 6 = 8\), \(28 - 14 = 14\), \(48 - 28 = 20\), \(74 - 48 = 26\). The differences between terms are increasing by \(6\) each time (\(8 + 6 = 14\), \(14 + 6 = 20\), \(20 + 6 = 26\)). This indicates a sequence that involves a quadratic relationship because the second differences are constant.

## 2: Determine the general form of the nth-term rule for a quadratic sequence.
A quadratic sequence often has an nth-term rule of the form \(an^2 + bn + c\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants to be determined. Given the sequence is related to \(3n^2\), we start with \(3n^2 + bn + c\).

## 3: Use given terms to set up equations to solve for \(b\) and \(c\).
Let's use the first three terms to set up equations:
1. For \(n = 1\), the term is \(6\): \(3(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 6\) or \(3 + b + c = 6\).
2. For \(n = 2\), the term is \(14\): \(3(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 14\) or \(12 + 2b + c = 14\).
3. For \(n = 3\), the term is \(28\): \(3(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 28\) or \(27 + 3b + c = 28\).

## 4: Solve the equations for \(b\) and \(c\).
From the equation in step 3.1: \(b + c = 3\).

The equation from step 3.2: \(2b + c = 2\).

Subtracting these two equations: \(2b + c - (b + c) = 2 - 3\), which simplifies to \(b = -1\).

Substituting \(b = -1\) into \(b + c = 3\): \(-1 + c = 3\), so \(c = 4\).

## 5: Interpret the solution in the context of the question.
The nth-term rule is \(3n^2 - n + 4\). Comparing this to the given form \(3n^2 \triangle n + \square\), \(\triangle = -1\) and \(\square = 4\). The question asks about \(\triangle\), which we've found to be \(-1\).

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand quadratic sequences or how to derive the nth-term formula. They might guess or not attempt to find a pattern. Option B (\(-1\)) seems correct based on our calculation, but students might not accurately derive it.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may struggle with deriving \(b\) and \(c\). They might recognize the sequence isn't arithmetic or geometric but could struggle to apply the correct formula.
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to identify the sequence as quadratic and derive or use given formulas effectively. They are likely to choose B (\(-1\)) correctly.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand how to derive the formula but can also apply it accurately. They would likely choose B (\(-1\)).

## 7: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level.
Given the calculations and understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=10% (guessing), B=20% (some pattern recognition), C=30% (random guess), D=40% (random guess).
- **Basic**: A=15% (mistake in calculation), B=60% (getting the right sign but possibly through luck), C=10% (error), D=15% (error).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (careless mistake), B=80% (correct derivation), C=10% (minor error), D=5% (minor error).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (little chance of mistake), B=95% (accurate), C=3% (extremely rare error), D=2% (extremely rare error).

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=
