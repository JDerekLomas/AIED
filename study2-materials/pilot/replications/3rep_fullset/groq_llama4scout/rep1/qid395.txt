To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions involved.

The question involves two students, Tom and Katie, who have written different calculations based on the same diagram. The diagram shows an arrow pointing to the left indicating -18 and three arrows pointing to the left in three equal parts, implying a division or a representation of equal parts.

Tom writes \( 3 \times (-6) = -18 \), which implies that if you multiply 3 by -6, you get -18. This is mathematically correct because \( 3 \times (-6) = -18 \).

Katie writes \( \frac{-18}{3} = -6 \), which implies that if you divide -18 by 3, you get -6. This is also mathematically correct because \( \frac{-18}{3} = -6 \).

The question essentially tests the understanding of multiplication and division of negative numbers. A common misconception could involve the incorrect handling of negative signs during these operations.

## Step 1: Understanding the Calculations
Tom's calculation \( 3 \times (-6) = -18 \) is correct. When you multiply a positive number by a negative number, the result is negative.

## 2: Understanding Katie's Calculation
Katie's calculation \( \frac{-18}{3} = -6 \) is also correct. When you divide a negative number by a positive number, the result is negative.

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A potential misconception could be that students might incorrectly apply the rules of signs for multiplication and division. However, in this case, both Tom and Katie have applied the rules correctly.

## 4: Analyzing the Question for Difficulty
The question might seem straightforward, but the key is whether students recognize that both calculations are correct and based on the diagram provided. The diagram supports both interpretations: -18 divided into 3 equal parts is -6, and 3 groups of -6 make -18.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students may struggle with basic operations involving negative numbers. They might not fully understand the rules of signs or may make calculation errors. Therefore, they might choose D) Neither is correct, or they might incorrectly choose one over the other due to misunderstandings. 
  - A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a better grasp of operations with negative numbers but might still be prone to errors under pressure or with less familiar contexts. They are likely to recognize both calculations as correct but might be uncertain. 
  - A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%

- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with operations involving negative numbers and can apply them in various contexts. They should easily recognize that both Tom and Katie are correct.
  - A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the operations but can also reason about the mathematical concepts deeply. They would certainly recognize the correctness of both calculations.
  - A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

Given the clarity of the mathematical operations and the direct support from the diagram, most students, even at lower levels, should be able to see that both calculations are correct, assuming they understand basic multiplication and division rules for negative numbers.
