To approach this question, let's first analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie and determine their validity based on the given equation \(x = y - 4\).

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's statement
Tom claims that \(2x > y - 4\) is always true. Let's substitute \(x\) from the given equation into Tom's statement: \(2(y - 4) > y - 4\). Simplifying this, we get \(2y - 8 > y - 4\), which further simplifies to \(y > 4\). This means Tom's statement is not always true for all values of \(y\), specifically for \(y \leq 4\).

## 2: Analyze Katie's statement
Katie claims that \(x > y - 5\) is always true. Substituting \(x\) from the given equation into Katie's statement: \(y - 4 > y - 5\). Simplifying this, we get \(-4 > -5\), which is always true. This means Katie's statement is indeed always true.

## 3: Determine the correctness of Tom and Katie's statements
From the analysis, Tom's statement is not always true, and Katie's statement is always true. Therefore, the correct answer is that only Katie is correct.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and substituting values into equations. They might not fully understand the implications of "always true" and could be easily misled by the statements. Given the nature of the question, a significant portion might choose A (Only Tom) or D (Neither is correct) due to confusion. However, without a deep understanding of algebra, they might lean towards incorrect options due to a lack of comprehension.

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding of algebra. They might be able to follow the substitution but could still be prone to errors in logical deductions about "always true" statements. They might incorrectly validate Tom's statement or dismiss Katie's without thorough analysis.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students can handle algebraic manipulations well and are more likely to understand the conditions under which statements are true. They should be able to identify Katie's statement as always true but might still struggle with the nuances of Tom's statement, potentially leading to a correct identification that only Katie is right.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand algebraic manipulations but also have a strong grasp of logical deductions and the conditions for statements to be universally true. They should easily identify that Katie's statement is always true and recognize the conditions under which Tom's statement fails, leading to a clear understanding that only Katie is correct.

## 5: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (misinterpreting Tom's statement), B=20% (correct but by chance or intuition), C=10% (both correct, which is incorrect), D=40% (total confusion).
- **Basic:** A=25% (some still misinterpret), B=40% (starting to understand Katie), C=15% (some confusion), D=20% (recognize not both are correct).
- **Proficient:** A=15% (less prone to Tom's error), B=60% (recognize Katie's correctness), C=10% (minimal confusion), D=15% (some still doubt).
- **Advanced:** A=5% (very few misinterpret), B=80% (clearly see Katie's correctness), C=5% (minimal to no confusion), D=10% (rarely doubt both).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
