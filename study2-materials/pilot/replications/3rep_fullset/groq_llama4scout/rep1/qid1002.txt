To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question of converting \( \frac{3}{20} \) into a decimal, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question requires students to convert a fraction to a decimal. \( \frac{3}{20} \) can be converted by dividing 3 by 20, which equals 0.15. 

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect division or a misunderstanding of the fraction. For example, some students might incorrectly calculate \( \frac{3}{20} \) as \( 3 \div 2 = 1.5 \) (which would be an error in calculation) or think of it as \( 3 \div 20 = 0.3 \) if they mistakenly simplify or miscalculate. Another error could be misreading the fraction or misplacing the decimal point.

## 2: Analyzing Option A - \( 0.15 \)
Option A, \( 0.15 \), is the correct answer. Students who are proficient in converting fractions to decimals should easily arrive at this answer.

## 3: Analyzing Option B - \( 0.3 \)
Option B, \( 0.3 \), could be a result of a calculation error where a student mistakenly thinks \( \frac{3}{20} = \frac{3}{10} \) or incorrectly calculates the decimal.

## 4: Analyzing Option C - \( 3.20 \)
Option C, \( 3.20 \), seems to involve a significant misunderstanding, possibly confusing the fraction with a whole number or incorrectly placing a decimal point.

## 5: Analyzing Option D - \( 0.12 \)
Option D, \( 0.12 \), might result from a miscalculation or incorrect conversion.

## 6: Ability Level Predictions
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle significantly. They might choose C (10-20%) due to a lack of understanding of fractions and decimals, B (20-30%) due to simple miscalculations, D (20-30%) for similar reasons, and A (30-40%) if they somehow manage to get it right or through guesswork.
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a foundational understanding but may still make errors. They might choose A (60-70%) correctly, B (15-25%) due to minor calculation errors, D (10-20%) for similar reasons, and C (5-15%) due to more significant misunderstandings.
- **Proficient:** Students here should have a solid grasp. They might choose A (85-90%) correctly, B (5-10%) for minor errors, D (3-5%) due to oversight, and C (2-5%) due to significant mistakes.
- **Advanced:** These students are expected to excel. They would likely choose A (95-98%) correctly, with very few opting for B (1-3%), D (1%), or C (1%).

## 7: Final Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
- **basic:** A=65% B=20% C=10% D=5%
- **proficient:** A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- **advanced:** A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%

The best answer is A.
