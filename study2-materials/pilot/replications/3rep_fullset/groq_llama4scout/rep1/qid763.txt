To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing and the potential misconceptions involved. The question presents a quadratic curve that passes through the points (-2,0) and (1,0) on the x-axis. This information implies that the equation of the curve can be written in the form of \(y = a(x + 2)(x - 1)\), where \(a\) is a constant. 

The general form of a quadratic equation is \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\), and when factored, it can be represented as \(y = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\) where \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) are the roots of the equation (the x-intercepts).

## Step 1: Understanding the Given Information
The curve passes through (-2,0) and (1,0), meaning these are the roots of the equation. Therefore, the equation can be expressed as \(y = a(x + 2)(x - 1)\).

## 2: Identifying the Correct Form
To match the given options, let's expand the general form: \(y = a(x^2 + x - 2)\). For simplicity and without loss of generality, if \(a = 1\), then \(y = (x + 2)(x - 1) = x^2 + x - 2\). 

## 3: Comparing with Given Options
Now, let's compare this with the provided options:
- A: \(y = (x - 2)(x + 1)\) implies roots at (2,0) and (-1,0), which doesn't match.
- B: \(y = (x - 1)(x + 2)\) implies roots at (1,0) and (-2,0), which matches our given points.
- C: \(y = x^2 - 2\) does not have roots at (-2,0) and (1,0).
- D: \(y = x^2 - 2x\) can be rewritten as \(y = x(x - 2)\), implying roots at (0,0) and (2,0), which doesn't match.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the concept of roots and factoring. They might randomly select an option or choose based on superficial similarities. Option B seems correct based on the roots given, but these students might not accurately recall or apply the formula. Given the simplicity of the correct answer, \(B = 30\%\), other options might attract \(20\%\) each due to guessing or partial understanding, with \(B\) being slightly higher due to its direct relation to the roots provided.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic algebra and might recognize the form \(y = (x - r_1)(x - r_2)\). They should be able to identify the correct roots, making \(B = 60\%\), with \(A\), \(C\), and \(D\) around \(10-13\%\) each due to either misunderstanding the roots or not applying them correctly.
- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with quadratic equations and should easily identify that the equation must have roots at (-2,0) and (1,0). Thus, \(B = 90\%\), with the remaining options attracting \(3-5\%\) each, primarily due to careless mistakes.
- **Advanced:** For advanced students, this question is straightforward. They will quickly factor the equation based on the roots given. Hence, \(B = 95\%\), with minor percentages for other options, mostly due to quick errors in calculation or oversight.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
