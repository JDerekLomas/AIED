To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions.

The question revolves around the subtraction of fractions, specifically \( \frac{5}{6} - \frac{1}{3} \). To perform this operation, finding a common denominator is essential. 

## Step 1: Understanding the Operations
Tom suggests changing both denominators to 6, and Katie suggests changing both to 18. 

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Suggestion
For Tom's suggestion, if we change \( \frac{1}{3} \) to have a denominator of 6, it becomes \( \frac{2}{6} \) because \( \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 2}{3 \times 2} = \frac{2}{6} \). Then, \( \frac{5}{6} - \frac{2}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \). This is a valid method.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Suggestion
For Katie's suggestion, if we change \( \frac{5}{6} \) to have a denominator of 18, it becomes \( \frac{5 \times 3}{6 \times 3} = \frac{15}{18} \), and \( \frac{1}{3} \) becomes \( \frac{1 \times 6}{3 \times 6} = \frac{6}{18} \). Then, \( \frac{15}{18} - \frac{6}{18} = \frac{9}{18} = \frac{1}{2} \). This is also a valid method.

## 4: Evaluating the Options
Given that both Tom and Katie provide valid methods for solving the problem, the correct answer is that both are correct.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with finding common denominators or understanding the concept of equivalent fractions. They might not fully grasp why both methods are valid or could incorrectly assume one or both are incorrect due to a lack of understanding. Therefore, they might be more likely to choose D (Neither is correct) or not understand the question fully. A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of fractions and could see that both methods involve finding a common denominator. However, they might still make errors in calculation or understanding the implications of each method. They are likely to recognize both methods as valid. A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand fractions well and can easily see that both Tom and Katie's methods are correct. They can perform the calculations and understand the concept of equivalent fractions. Thus, they are likely to choose C (Both Tom and Katie). A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also reason about the efficiency and applicability of each method. They would easily see that both methods are correct and might even discuss the advantages of one over the other (e.g., simpler calculations with Tom's method). A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
