## Step 1: Understanding the Quadratic Formula
The quadratic formula is given by \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are coefficients from the quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). To apply this formula to the given equation \(h^2 + 4 = 5h\), we first need to rearrange it into the standard form: \(h^2 - 5h + 4 = 0\).

## 2: Identifying Coefficients
From the rearranged equation \(h^2 - 5h + 4 = 0\), we can identify that \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = 4\).

## 3: Applying the Quadratic Formula
Substituting \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the quadratic formula gives us \(h = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 4}}{2 \cdot 1}\). Simplifying inside the square root: \(h = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 16}}{2}\), which further simplifies to \(h = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{9}}{2}\).

## 4: Focusing on the Question
The question asks what should replace the star in \( \frac{ \bigstar\pm \sqrt{?-?}}{?} \) to match the quadratic formula application. The denominator should be \(2a = 2 \cdot 1 = 2\). The part under the square root is \(b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 = 25 - 16 = 9\). The star represents \(-b\), which is \(-(-5) = 5\).

## 5: Analyzing Possible Errors
The question essentially tests the recognition of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the quadratic formula and the correct application of these in the formula. A common misconception could involve misidentifying \(b\) or \(c\), or misapplying the signs. However, given that the equation and the formula are standard, and the numbers are straightforward, the main challenge lies in accurately applying the formula.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with rearranging the equation and identifying \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). They might not accurately recall the quadratic formula or could confuse the terms. Given the simplicity of the numbers, some might guess or incorrectly apply the formula, potentially leading to a higher chance of selecting an incorrect option. \(A=20\% B=20\% C=40\% D=20\%\)
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a better grasp of the quadratic formula but might still make careless mistakes or confuse the coefficients. They are more likely to recognize the correct application but could be distracted by the simplicity of the numbers. \(A=10\% B=10\% C=60\% D=20\%\)
- **Proficient**: Students here are expected to accurately apply the quadratic formula. They should identify \(a=1\), \(b=-5\), and \(c=4\), leading to the correct replacement for the star being \(5\). \(A=5\% B=5\% C=80\% D=10\%\)
- **Advanced**: These students not only apply the formula correctly but also understand the underlying concepts deeply. They are less likely to make mistakes. \(A=2\% B=2\% C=90\% D=6\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
