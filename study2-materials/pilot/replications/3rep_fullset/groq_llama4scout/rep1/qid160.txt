## Step 1: Understand the question and the formula provided
The area \(A\) of a trapezium is given by \( A = \frac{1}{2}h(a + b) \), where \(h\) is the height, and \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the parallel sides. For the given trapezium, \( a = x + 2 \), \( b = x + 4 \), and \( h = x \). The area is given as \( 40 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \), so we have \( 40 = \frac{1}{2}x((x + 2) + (x + 4)) \).

## 2: Derive the equation from the given information
Substitute the given values into the area formula: \( 40 = \frac{1}{2}x(x + 2 + x + 4) \).
Simplifying, we get: \( 40 = \frac{1}{2}x(2x + 6) \).
Further simplification yields: \( 40 = \frac{1}{2}x(2)(x + 3) \) or \( 40 = x(x + 3) \).
This gives the equation: \( x^2 + 3x = 40 \).

## 3: Solve the equation
Rearrange the equation to set it to 0: \( x^2 + 3x - 40 = 0 \).
We solve for \(x\) using the quadratic formula, \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -40 \).
Substituting these values in gives: \( x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4(1)(-40)}}{2(1)} \).
Simplifying inside the square root: \( x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 160}}{2} \).
Further simplification: \( x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{169}}{2} \).
Which gives: \( x = \frac{-3 \pm 13}{2} \).
So, the solutions are: \( x = \frac{-3 + 13}{2} = 5 \) and \( x = \frac{-3 - 13}{2} = -8 \).

## 4: Analyze the solutions in the context of the question
The solutions to the equation \( x^2 + 3x = 40 \) are \( x = 5 \) and \( x = -8 \).

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with solving quadratic equations or may not even attempt to solve them, potentially leading to random guesses. However, given the direct nature of the question, they might lean towards options that seem more "reasonable" or are easier to calculate. Option B seems correct based on our calculation, but these students might not accurately solve the equation. Expect a high percentage of incorrect responses, potentially scattered across options.
- **Basic**: Students at this level can solve simple equations but might make errors in more complex ones or in rearranging formulas. They are likely to attempt solving the quadratic equation but might make calculation errors. They might be more likely to choose an option that reflects a common mistake or partial understanding.
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with quadratic equations and should be able to solve them accurately. They are likely to choose the correct option (B) as they can correctly solve \( x^2 + 3x - 40 = 0 \) to get \( x = 5 \) and \( x = -8 \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only solve the equation correctly but also understand the context and implications of their solutions. They will easily identify the correct solutions as \( x = 5 \) and \( x = -8 \), choosing option B.

## 6: Assign percentages based on ability levels and question difficulty
Given the straightforward nature of solving the quadratic equation once it's set up, and assuming most students can relate the given area formula to the trapezium's dimensions:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic**: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

The best answer is B.
