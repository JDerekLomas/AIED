To approach this question, let's analyze what each option means and how it relates to the given expression \(6 - 3g\).

- **Variable**: A variable is a symbol that represents a value that can change. In \(6 - 3g\), \(g\) is a variable.
- **Expression**: An expression is a group of numbers, symbols, and/or operators that represents a value. \(6 - 3g\) fits this definition as it consists of numbers, a variable, and an operator.
- **Equation**: An equation is a statement that two mathematical expressions have the same value. \(6 - 3g\) does not state that it equals something else, so it's not an equation on its own.
- **Term**: A term is a single part of an expression that is separated by operators. In \(6 - 3g\), there are two terms: \(6\) and \(-3g\).

Given these definitions:

- The expression \(6 - 3g\) clearly contains a **variable** (\(g\)), but it's not exclusively a variable.
- It's an **expression** because it's a collection of numbers, a variable, and an operator.
- It's not an **equation** because it doesn't assert equality with another expression.
- It's composed of **terms**, but the question seems to ask for a description of the whole expression \(6 - 3g\), not its parts.

The most straightforward and encompassing description of \(6 - 3g\) is that it is an **expression**. 

Now, let's predict the performance of students at different levels:

### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with the vocabulary and basic concepts. They might not understand the terms "expression," "equation," "variable," and "term" clearly or might confuse them.
- A=30% (some might think "variable" describes the whole expression because \(g\) is a variable)
- B=40% (recognizing it as an expression)
- C=20% (mistaking it for an equation because they expect an "=")
- D=10% (less likely to choose term)

### basic
Students at this level have a better grasp of basic algebraic concepts but might still struggle with precise definitions.
- A=20% (still some confusion with variable)
- B=50% (most would recognize it as an expression)
- C=15% (some might still think it's an equation)
- D=15% (some recognize it has terms but might not choose it)

### proficient
Proficient students have a solid understanding of algebra and its terminology.
- A=5% (rarely would they confuse with variable)
- B=70% (most would accurately identify it as an expression)
- C=5% (unlikely to think it's an equation)
- D=20% (some might choose term, understanding it's made of terms)

### advanced
Advanced students not only understand the concepts but can also apply them precisely.
- A=0% (unlikely to confuse with variable)
- B=90% (almost all would identify it as an expression)
- C=0% (know it's not an equation)
- D=10% (a few might consider term, but expression is more appropriate)

Given the question and typical student understanding:

below_basic: A=25% B=40% C=25% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=55% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
