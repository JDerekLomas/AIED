## Step 1: Understand the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for a given math question. The question is about rearranging a formula to make \( u \) the subject.

## 2: Analyze the question
The question provides a formula: \( 7t - 13 = u(5 + 2t) \). The task is to rearrange this formula to solve for \( u \). This involves algebraic manipulation, specifically isolating \( u \) on one side of the equation.

## 3: Solve the equation for \( u \)
To solve for \( u \), divide both sides by \( 5 + 2t \):
\[ u = \frac{7t - 13}{5 + 2t} \]
This matches option B.

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and errors
A common error might be to incorrectly distribute or combine terms. For example, some students might try to subtract \( 2t \) from both sides or confuse the order of operations. However, given the straightforward nature of the algebraic manipulation required, the main challenge is likely to be in executing the division correctly and not getting confused by the form of the equation.

## 5: Evaluate the difficulty level and potential student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and could easily choose an incorrect option due to confusion. They might not even attempt to solve it or could choose an option that seems right but isn't, like A or D, due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding of algebra. They might be able to follow simple manipulations but could still make errors, especially if they're not confident in their ability to rearrange equations. They might choose B if they understand the division step but could be tempted by A or D if their algebraic manipulation goes awry.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand algebraic manipulations well and should be able to correctly rearrange the equation to get \( u = \frac{7t - 13}{5 + 2t} \), choosing option B. They might still consider other options but should be able to logically eliminate them.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to handle algebraic manipulations with ease and should have no trouble correctly solving for \( u \) and choosing option B.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (simple incorrect manipulation), B=20% (correct but might not attempt), C=10% (unlikely but possible confusion), D=30% (another simple incorrect option).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=60%, C=5%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=85%, C=2%, D=8%.
- **Advanced**: A=1%, B=95%, C=1%, D=3%.

## 7: Convert predictions into requested format
Given the predicted percentages:
- below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
- basic: A=20% B=60% C=5% D=15%
- proficient: A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%
- advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
