## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the equation of a circle given that it passes through the points (4,0), (0, -4), (-4,0), and (0,4). The general equation of a circle centered at the origin is \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

## 2: Identifying the Radius
To find the equation of the circle, we need to determine the radius. Since the circle passes through (4,0), we can substitute these coordinates into the general equation to find \(r^2\). Substituting \(x = 4\) and \(y = 0\) gives \(4^2 + 0^2 = r^2\), which simplifies to \(16 = r^2\).

## 3: Writing the Equation of the Circle
Given \(r^2 = 16\), the equation of the circle is \(x^2 + y^2 = 16\). This matches option A.

## 4: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Errors
- Option B, \(x^2 + y^2 = \sqrt{4}\), suggests a radius squared of \(\sqrt{4} = 2\), which is incorrect given the points provided.
- Option C, \(x^2 + y^2 = 8\), suggests a radius squared of \(8\), which does not match the given points.
- Option D, \(x^2 + y^2 = 4\), suggests a radius squared of \(4\), which also does not match.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the concept of the equation of a circle or substituting points into an equation. They might choose an option that seems simple or familiar, such as D, or incorrectly calculate. Given the simplicity of the question and the obvious correctness of A, they might still choose A but with a higher likelihood of choosing B, C, or D due to confusion. However, A seems straightforward: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level understand the basics of circles and equations but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to recognize the circle's radius is 4, hence A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of the concepts and are less likely to make errors. They will accurately determine the radius and equation: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately and quickly. They are highly likely to choose the correct answer without hesitation: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.3% D=0.2%.

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **basic:** A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **proficient:** A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
- **advanced:** A=99% B=0.5% C=0.3% D=0.2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.3% D=0.2%
