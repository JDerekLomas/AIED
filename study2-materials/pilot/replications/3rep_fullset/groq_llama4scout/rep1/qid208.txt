To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and the potential pitfalls for students at different levels.

This question tests the concept of proportionality and division, specifically in the context of finding the cost of a different quantity of items given the cost of a certain quantity. The question requires students to first find the cost of one ruler and then calculate the cost of five rulers.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question states that twelve rulers cost \( 96 p \). To find out how much five rulers cost, students need to divide \( 96 p \) by 12 to get the cost of one ruler and then multiply that cost by 5.

## 2: Identifying Potential Errors
A common misconception might involve directly dividing or multiplying without properly considering the units or the relationship between the quantities. However, the numbers given here (\( 96 p \) for 12 rulers) are straightforward for division.

## 3: Calculating the Correct Answer
To find the cost of one ruler: \( 96 p / 12 = 8 p \) per ruler.
Then, the cost of five rulers: \( 8 p \times 5 = 40 p \).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with division and multiplication facts. They might not accurately divide \( 96 p \) by 12 or multiply the result by 5. Option C (\( 8 p \)) might seem appealing as it's directly related to the cost of one ruler, but let's assume they could be misled into various incorrect options. Given the nature of the question, a significant portion might choose C because it reflects a misunderstanding of the question (thinking one ruler's cost is the answer), but others might randomly select or misunderstand the calculation entirely.
- **Basic:** Students here should be able to perform the division and multiplication but might make careless errors. They are likely to understand the concept of finding the unit cost and then the cost for five rulers. The correct answer, B (\( 40 p \)), should be within their reach, but some might make calculation errors.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily solve the problem, finding that one ruler costs \( 8 p \) and five rulers cost \( 40 p \). They are less likely to be misled by incorrect options.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should not only solve the problem easily but also be able to quickly assess the reasonableness of their answer. They are highly unlikely to choose incorrect options.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation and assuming most students can handle simple division and multiplication:
- **Below Basic:** A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15% (Many struggle, and C seems like a plausible "one ruler" cost)
- **Basic:** A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5% (Most get it right, some minor errors)
- **Proficient:** A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5% (Very few errors)
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=99% C=0% D=1% (Almost no errors)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=99% C=0% D=1%
