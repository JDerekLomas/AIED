To approach this question, let's analyze the potential for students to make errors based on common misconceptions and the simplicity of the fraction given.

The fraction \( \frac{4}{5} \) is a straightforward and familiar fraction. Converting it to a percentage involves dividing 4 by 5 and then multiplying by 100, or simply recognizing it as a fraction that translates directly to a percentage.

## Step 1: Understanding the Fraction
The fraction \( \frac{4}{5} \) can be easily converted to a decimal by dividing 4 by 5, which equals 0.8. Multiplying 0.8 by 100 gives 80%.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the numerator and denominator or not multiplying by 100 correctly. However, given the simplicity of \( \frac{4}{5} \), most students are likely to recognize it as equivalent to 80% without much trouble.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 80 \% \)
- Option B: \( 40 \% \)
- Option C: \( 45 \% \)
- Option D: \( 75 \% \)

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic conversions. They might not know how to convert a fraction to a percentage or could make a simple calculation error. Given \( \frac{4}{5} \) is a simple fraction, some might still get it wrong, but let's assume a significant portion would choose an incorrect option randomly or based on a misconception. \( A=60\% \) (optimistic guess that some might get it right), \( B=15\% \), \( C=10\% \), \( D=15\% \).
- **Basic**: At this level, students are expected to have a basic understanding of fractions and percentages. They might make simple errors. \( A=80\% \), \( B=10\% \), \( C=5\% \), \( D=5\% \).
- **Proficient**: Students here are likely to understand the concept well and make few errors. \( A=95\% \), \( B=2.5\% \), \( C=1.25\% \), \( D=1.25\% \).
- **Advanced**: These students are expected to have a deep understanding and rarely make errors. \( A=99\% \), \( B=0.5\% \), \( C=0.25\% \), \( D=0.25\% \).

## 5: Adjusting for Realistic Predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=50% B=20% C=15% D=15%
- **Basic**: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=95% B=2% C=1.5% D=1.5%
- **Advanced**: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=50% B=20% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=2% C=1.5% D=1.5%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%
