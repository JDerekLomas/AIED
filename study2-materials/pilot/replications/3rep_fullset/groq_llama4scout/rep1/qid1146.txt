## Step 1: Understand the question
The question presents a rectangle with one side labeled as \(x\) and the other side as \(x^2 + 9\). The area of the rectangle is given as \(8 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\). The task is to determine which equation represents the relationship given the area.

## 2: Recall the formula for the area of a rectangle
The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula \(A = \text{length} \times \text{width}\). In this case, the area \(A = 8\), the length is \(x^2 + 9\), and the width is \(x\). So, the equation based on the given information is \(x(x^2 + 9) = 8\).

## 3: Expand the area equation
Expanding the equation \(x(x^2 + 9) = 8\) gives \(x^3 + 9x = 8\).

## 4: Compare with the given options
- Option A: \(x^{3}+9=8\)
- Option B: \(x^{2}+x+9=8\)
- Option C: \(2 x^{2}+2 x+18=8\)
- Option D: \(x^{3}+9 x=8\)

## 5: Analyze each option
- Option A is incorrect because it doesn't account for \(x\) multiplying \(x^2 + 9\).
- Option B is incorrect as it incorrectly represents the relationship between the sides and the area.
- Option C is incorrect because it seems to be a manipulated version that doesn't directly derive from the area formula.
- Option D directly matches the expanded form of the area equation.

## 6: Consider student understanding at different levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic expressions and the concept of area. They might incorrectly choose A or B due to misunderstanding the formula or not fully expanding the equation.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the area formula but struggle with algebraic manipulation. They could be tempted by A or B.
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to correctly expand the equation and identify D as the correct answer. They might still make errors if they're not careful with algebraic manipulations.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should easily identify the correct equation and be less likely to be misled by incorrect options.

## 7: Predict student responses
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (simple substitution error), B=30% (misunderstanding of area formula), C=15% (random or complex error), D=15% (correct but requires algebraic understanding).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=25%, C=10%, D=45% (as they get more familiar with the area formula and basic algebra).
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85% (strong understanding of algebra and area).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (excellent algebraic skills and understanding of geometric formulas).

## 8: Final prediction in required format
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
