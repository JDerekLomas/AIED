To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions it may trigger, considering the different ability levels of students: below_basic, basic, proficient, and advanced.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a quadratic curve with a minimum point at (1,0) and asks for the equation of this curve. The general form of a quadratic equation is \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\), but given the vertex form \(y = a(x-h)^2 + k\), where \((h,k)\) is the vertex of the parabola, we can directly apply this to find the equation.

## 2: Identifying Key Information
The vertex of the parabola is given as \((1,0)\). For a quadratic curve with its vertex at \((h,k)\), the equation can be written as \(y = a(x-h)^2 + k\). Substituting \((h,k) = (1,0)\), we get \(y = a(x-1)^2\). Since the parabola has a minimum point and opens upwards (implied by it having a minimum), \(a > 0\). The simplest form, assuming \(a=1\), is \(y = (x-1)^2\).

## 3: Analyzing Options
- A: \(y = (x-1)^2\) matches our derivation for \(a=1\).
- B: \(y = (x+1)^2\) suggests a vertex at \((-1,0)\), not \((1,0)\).
- C: \(y = x^2 - 1\) can be rewritten as \(y = (x-0)^2 - 1\), suggesting a vertex at \((0,-1)\), not \((1,0)\).
- D: \(y = x^2 + 1\) suggests a vertex at \((0,1)\), not \((1,0)\).

## 4: Considering Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with identifying the vertex form of a quadratic equation or may not fully understand how to apply given information to select the correct equation. They might mistakenly choose based on superficial similarities or incorrect calculations. Option A seems correct based on the vertex given, but other options might seem plausible if students misinterpret the vertex or the form of the equation. **A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%**
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a better grasp of quadratic equations and vertex form. They are likely to recognize the vertex \((1,0)\) and apply it correctly to choose option A. Misconceptions about the sign or position of the vertex might lead some to consider B. **A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%**
- **Proficient:** These students are familiar with the vertex form and can easily identify the correct equation. They are less likely to be misled by incorrect options. **A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%**
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the vertex form but also can quickly derive or verify the equation. They are highly unlikely to choose incorrect options. **A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
