To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about the coordinates of the turning point of the graph \( y = (x - 1)^2 + 4 \), let's consider the nature of the question and common misconceptions.

The given equation is in vertex form, \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \( (h, k) \) is the vertex (or turning point) of the parabola. For the equation \( y = (x - 1)^2 + 4 \), it's clear that \( h = 1 \) and \( k = 4 \), so the turning point is \( (1, 4) \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question is straightforward and tests the understanding of the vertex form of a quadratic equation. The correct answer is A: \( (1, 4) \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the signs or the values of \( h \) and \( k \), or not fully understanding how the vertex form of a quadratic equation relates to its graph.

## 3: Analyzing Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic concepts and may not fully understand the vertex form of a quadratic equation. They might incorrectly identify \( h \) or \( k \), or both, leading to errors in identifying the turning point.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make simple mistakes, such as confusing \( (x - 1) \) with \( (x + 1) \) or misinterpreting the constant term.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the vertex form and can apply it to find the turning point. They are less likely to make errors if they recognize the equation is in vertex form.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the vertex form but can also derive it from standard form. They are highly unlikely to make errors on this question.

## 4: Predicting Responses
Given the clarity of the question and the simplicity of identifying the turning point from the vertex form:
- **Below Basic:** Might have a high chance of error, possibly confusing the coordinates. Let's assume A=60% (correct), B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Basic:** Should have a good understanding, so A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** These students should almost always get it right, so A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.
- **Advanced:** Virtually all will get it right, so A=99%, B=0.5%, C=0.25%, D=0.25%.

## 5: Final Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **basic:** A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **proficient:** A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
- **advanced:** A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%
