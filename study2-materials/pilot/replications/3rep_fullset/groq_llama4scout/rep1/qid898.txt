## Step 1: Understand the question and the common misconception
The question asks students to compare two temperatures, \( -5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) and \( 2^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \), and determine the correct statement regarding their difference. A common misconception in dealing with negative numbers and temperatures is understanding the concept of "hotter" and "colder" and applying it correctly in calculations.

## 2: Identify the correct answer
To find the correct answer, calculate the difference between \( 2^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) and \( -5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). The difference is \( 2 - (-5) = 2 + 5 = 7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). This means \( 2^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) hotter than \( -5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \). So, the correct statement is B: \( 2^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 7^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) hotter than \( -5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \).

## 3: Analyze the potential for misconceptions at different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic arithmetic operations involving negative numbers and may not fully understand the concepts of "hotter" and "colder" in the context of temperature. They are likely to choose incorrect options due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of arithmetic with negative numbers but might still struggle with applying these concepts to real-world scenarios like temperature comparisons. Misconceptions about negative numbers and temperature differences might lead them to choose A or C.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should have a solid understanding of arithmetic operations with negative numbers and should be able to apply these concepts to find the correct temperature difference. However, they might still be prone to selecting incorrect options if they misinterpret "hotter" and "colder".
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, including those involving negative numbers and temperature. They are less likely to make errors in calculating differences and understanding the terms "hotter" and "colder".

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple but incorrect), B=20% (correct but challenging), C=30% (incorrect, misinterpreting concepts), D=20% (incorrect, misinterpreting concepts).
- **Basic**: A=20% (less likely to choose obviously incorrect), B=60% (understanding improves), C=10% (unlikely to choose this), D=10% (unlikely to choose this).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (很少选择), B=85% (strong understanding), C=5% (unlikely), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (no chance), B=95% (almost certain), C=2.5% (very unlikely), D=2.5% (very unlikely).

## 5: Convert predictions into the required format
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2.5% D=2.5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2.5% D=2.5%
