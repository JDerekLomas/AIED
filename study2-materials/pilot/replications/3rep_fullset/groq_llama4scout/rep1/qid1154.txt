To approach this question, let's first analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie in the context of basic algebraic principles.

Tom says \( a(b+c) \equiv (b+c) \times a \). This statement is correct because multiplication is commutative, meaning that the order of the factors does not change the product. Therefore, \( a(b+c) = (b+c)a = (b+c) \times a \).

Katie says \( a(b+c) \equiv ab + c \). This statement is incorrect because it mistakenly applies the distributive property incorrectly. The correct application of the distributive property is \( a(b+c) = ab + ac \), not \( ab + c \).

Given these analyses:

- Tom is correct because \( a(b+c) \) indeed equals \( (b+c) \times a \) due to the commutative property of multiplication.
- Katie is incorrect because \( a(b+c) \) equals \( ab + ac \), not \( ab + c \).

So, the correct answer is that only Tom is correct.

Now, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic concepts and the syntax of algebraic expressions. They might not fully understand the distributive property or the commutative property of multiplication.

- A (Only Tom): 30% (some might recognize Tom's statement as correct due to a basic understanding of commutativity)
- B (Only Katie): 20% (might mistakenly think Katie's statement is correct or partially correct)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 10% (unlikely to understand both correctly)
- D (Neither is correct): 40% (might not understand either statement correctly)

### basic
Students at this level have a foundational understanding of algebra but might still make errors in applying properties.

- A (Only Tom): 60% (recognize Tom's correctness)
- B (Only Katie): 15% (still might confuse Katie's statement)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 5% (unlikely to think both are correct)
- D (Neither is correct): 20% (some might still be unsure)

### proficient
Proficient students have a solid grasp of algebraic properties and can apply them correctly.

- A (Only Tom): 80% (clearly understand Tom's correctness)
- B (Only Katie): 5% (less likely to confuse Katie's statement now)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 2% (very unlikely to think both are correct)
- D (Neither is correct): 13% (unlikely but some might still have doubts)

### advanced
Advanced students not only understand algebraic properties but can also analyze and critique algebraic expressions effectively.

- A (Only Tom): 90% (clear understanding of Tom's statement)
- B (Only Katie): 2% (unlikely to mistake Katie's statement)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 1% (extremely unlikely)
- D (Neither is correct): 7% (very few would think neither is correct)

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=2% D=13%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=1% D=7%
