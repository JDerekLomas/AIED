## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential misconceptions
The question asks students to approximate the solution to \( x^{2}<5 \) using a graph of \( y = x^{2} \). The correct solution involves finding where \( y < 5 \) on the graph, which translates to \( -\sqrt{5} < x < \sqrt{5} \). Given that \( \sqrt{5} \) is approximately 2.2, the correct answer is \( -2.2 < x < 2.2 \), option B.

## 2: Identify potential errors for each ability level
- Students at the **below_basic** level might struggle to understand the question, misinterpret the graph, or not know how to solve inequalities.
- Students at the **basic** level should have a grasp of quadratic graphs and simple inequalities but might make mistakes in reading the graph or solving the inequality.
- Students at the **proficient** level are expected to solve this with ease but might make minor errors due to hasty calculations or graph reading.
- Students at the **advanced** level should not make errors in solving this problem.

## 3: Analyze option A (\( x<25 \))
This option seems unrelated to the graph or the inequality \( x^{2}<5 \) directly. It's an incorrect solution that doesn't derive from the inequality or graph.

## 4: Analyze option B (\( -2.2<x<2.2 \))
This is the correct solution. Students need to recognize that \( x^{2} = 5 \) when \( x = \pm\sqrt{5} \), and since \( \sqrt{5} \approx 2.2 \), the inequality \( x^{2} < 5 \) holds true for \( -2.2 < x < 2.2 \).

## 5: Analyze option C (\( x<-2.2, x>2.2 \))
This option represents the solution to \( x^{2} > 5 \), not \( x^{2} < 5 \). It's a common misconception to confuse the direction of the inequality.

## 6: Analyze option D (\( x \geq 0 \))
This option ignores the negative solutions and only considers non-negative \( x \) values, which does not satisfy \( x^{2} < 5 \) for all \( x \).

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: A=40% (random guess), B=20% (some might get it by chance or rough estimation), C=20% (confusing with \( x^{2} > 5 \)), D=20% (not understanding inequalities).
- **Basic**: A=10% (unlikely to choose this), B=60% (can read graph and understand basic inequality), C=20% (common error), D=10% (some might think only positive \( x \) applies).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (rare mistake), B=80% (correctly solve and read graph), C=10% (some might still confuse), D=5% (understanding but minor errors).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (no chance of this mistake), B=95% (confidently correct), C=3% (rare error), D=2% (very unlikely).

## 8: Convert predictions into percentages for each level
- **below_basic**: A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%
- **basic**: A=10%, B=60%, C=20%, D=10%
- **proficient**: A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0%, B=95%, C=3%, D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
