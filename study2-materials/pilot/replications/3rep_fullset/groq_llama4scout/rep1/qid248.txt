To approach this question, let's analyze the characteristics of a quadratic graph and how students at different ability levels might perceive the options provided.

A quadratic graph is typically characterized by its parabolic shape, which can open upwards or downwards. This shape is symmetrical about its vertex. 

- Option A describes a straight line, which is not a quadratic graph but rather a linear one.
- Option B describes a curve that starts in the bottom left, moves steeply up and right, levels off briefly, then continues steeply up and right. This doesn't sound like a typical parabolic shape because it doesn't level off and then come back down or remain symmetrical; it just keeps going up.
- Option C describes two curves in different quadrants, each dropping quickly towards an axis and then becoming almost parallel to that axis. This doesn't fit the standard description of a quadratic equation's graph, which is a single, symmetrical curve.
- Option D describes a graph that starts in the top left, drops steeply down as you move right, briefly levels off, then steeply up back to the same level as the starting point, forming a symmetrical U shape. This description aligns well with a quadratic graph that opens upwards.

Given these descriptions:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may not have a strong understanding of what constitutes a quadratic graph. They might be confused by the descriptions but could mistakenly identify a straight line (A) or incorrectly choose based on limited understanding. 
  - A=40% (misunderstanding of quadratic), B=25% (not recognizing it's not a simple curve), C=20% (confused by two parts), D=15% (some might recognize the U-shape).

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding and might recognize a straight line is not quadratic. They might still struggle with the abstract descriptions.
  - A=10% (recognize it's not quadratic), B=30% (might think it's a curve but not sure), C=20% (confused), D=40% (recognize the U-shape as quadratic).

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of quadratic equations and their graphs. They should easily recognize the straight line (A) is not quadratic and have a good sense of what a quadratic graph looks like.
  - A=5% (easy to eliminate), B=15% (unlikely to choose as not symmetrical), C=10% (unlikely due to description), D=70% (clearly a quadratic shape).

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand what a quadratic graph looks like but can also analyze the given descriptions critically.
  - A=0% (no chance of choosing a straight line), B=5% (easily eliminated), C=5% (easily eliminated), D=90% (clear recognition of a quadratic graph).

Based on this analysis:

below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=20% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=15% C=10% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=5% D=90%
