## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to convert \( 500000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \) to litres. Knowing that \( 1 \mathrm{~litre} = 1000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \) is crucial for solving this.

## 2: Identifying the Conversion
To convert \( 500000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \) to litres, we divide by 1000 since \( 1 \mathrm{~litre} = 1000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \). So, \( 500000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 500000 / 1000 = 500 \) litres.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the conversion factors or misplacing the decimal point. However, this question is straightforward because it directly tests the conversion from \( \mathrm{cm}^{3} \) to litres without introducing complex numbers or contexts that might trigger additional errors.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic conversions or have a weak understanding of the relationship between \( \mathrm{cm}^{3} \) and litres. They might incorrectly apply conversion factors or not understand the question. Option C (500) seems correct based on straightforward calculation, but these students might not perform the calculation correctly or might choose an option based on a miscalculation. Given the simplicity of the calculation, \( A = 20\% \) (completely off, e.g., not converting), \( B = 10\% \) (miscalculation), \( C = 60\% \) (correct calculation), \( D = 10\% \) (overestimation).

- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a basic understanding of conversions. They are likely to attempt the conversion but might make simple errors. \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 80\% \), \( D = 5\% \).

- **Proficient:** These students are expected to have a solid grasp of conversions between units. They should easily convert \( 500000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \) to 500 litres. \( A = 0\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 95\% \), \( D = 0\% \).

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply their knowledge accurately. They will find this question straightforward. \( A = 0\% \), \( B = 0\% \), \( C = 100\% \), \( D = 0\% \).

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
- **basic:** A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
- **proficient:** A=0% B=5% C=95% D=0%
- **advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=5% C=95% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
