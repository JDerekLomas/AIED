To approach this question, let's first break down the steps to find out how much cash Summer pays.

1. The total cost of the items: 
   - Dress = \( £ 73 \)
   - Two pairs of shoes = \( 2 \times £ 41 = £ 82 \)
   - Total cost = \( £ 73 + £ 82 = £ 155 \)

2. She pays using a \( £ 40 \) gift voucher and some cash.

3. The amount she pays in cash = Total cost - Gift voucher value
   - \( = £ 155 - £ 40 = £ 115 \)

So, the correct answer is A) \( £ 115 \).

Now, let's analyze the potential for errors based on student ability levels:

### Below Basic
- Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations or understanding the question. They might not calculate the total cost correctly or forget to subtract the gift voucher value.
- A: Correct calculation leads to \( £ 115 \), but they might not get this due to errors. (20%)
- B: \( £ 154 \) could be a result of incorrect calculation or misunderstanding. (40%)
- C: \( £ 188 \) seems to be an overestimation, possibly adding the gift voucher back or another error. (20%)
- D: \( £ 195 \) seems too high and might come from not using the gift voucher or a severe miscalculation. (20%)

### Basic
- Students here have a grasp of basic math but might make procedural errors or not fully understand the question's requirements.
- A: They should get \( £ 115 \) with correct calculations. (60%)
- B: Incorrect calculation or steps might lead to \( £ 154 \). (25%)
- C: Could result from incorrect steps or additions. (10%)
- D: Less likely with correct understanding and calculation. (5%)

### Proficient
- These students understand the math concepts well and are less likely to make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- A: Correct answer with proper calculations. (85%)
- B: Might occur from a miscalculation or misunderstanding the question. (10%)
- C: Unlikely but could happen with a significant error. (3%)
- D: Highly unlikely with correct calculations. (2%)

### Advanced
- These students not only understand the math concepts but are also less prone to errors in calculation and question interpretation.
- A: Correct calculation yielding \( £ 115 \). (95%)
- B: A rare mistake or miscalculation. (4%)
- C: Extremely unlikely. (1%)
- D: Highly unlikely. (0%)

Given the straightforward nature of the calculations and the fact that the question does not particularly lend itself to common misconceptions (like confusing percentages or ratios), most students should be able to compute the correct answer, especially if they read the question carefully.

Therefore, my predictions are:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
