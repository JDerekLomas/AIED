To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and the common misconceptions associated with it. The expression \(p^{2} - 4\) is a difference of squares, which can be factored into \((p-2)(p+2)\). This is a fundamental algebraic identity: \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not recognizing the difference of squares or mistakenly applying other factorisation techniques. For instance, some students might incorrectly factorise it as \(p(p-2)\) (option B), thinking of \(p\) as a common factor, but this would only be correct if the expression were \(p^2 - 2p\). Another potential mistake could be thinking it's a perfect square trinomial, leading to option C, \((p-2)(p-2)\) or \( (p-2)^2 \), which would only be correct if the expression were \(p^2 - 4p + 4\).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A, \((p-2)(p+2)\), is the correct factorisation for \(p^2 - 4\).
- Option B, \(p(p-2)\), incorrectly factors the expression.
- Option C, \((p-2)(p-2)\), suggests a perfect square, which is not applicable here.
- Option D, "Does not factorise," is incorrect because \(p^2 - 4\) can indeed be factored.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle to recognise the difference of squares or apply basic algebra. They may opt for B or C due to confusion or try to force factorisation that doesn't fit. A few might think it doesn't factorise (D). The correct answer, A, is likely to be chosen by a small percentage.
- **Basic:** Students here have foundational knowledge but may make careless mistakes. They are more likely to recognise the difference of squares, but some might still confuse it with other factorisation types. The percentage choosing A should increase, but B and C might still see significant selections.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily recognise \(p^2 - 4\) as a difference of squares. The majority should choose A. Options B, C, and D should see much lower percentages.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong algebraic foundation and are less likely to make mistakes on simple factorisation questions. A high percentage should choose A, with very few opting for B, C, or D.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (some grasp of basic concepts), B=30% (mistaken identity), C=25% (incorrect perfect square), D=25% (lack of understanding).
- **Basic:** A=50% (recognise difference of squares), B=20% (simple mistakes), C=15% (confusion with perfect square), D=15% (uncertainty).
- **Proficient:** A=80% (clear understanding), B=10% (occasional lapses), C=5% (rare confusion), D=5% (minimal doubt).
- **Advanced:** A=95% (strong confidence), B=3% (very rare mistake), C=1% (extremely rare error), D=1% (highly unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
