To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or challenges associated with it.

The question requires students to express the given expression as a single fraction, simplified as much as possible:

\[
\frac{1}{s+1}-\frac{t}{2}
\]

This involves finding a common denominator and then combining the fractions. The correct steps are:

1. Find a common denominator: \(2(s+1)\)
2. Rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{2}{2(s+1)} - \frac{t(s+1)}{2(s+1)}
\]
3. Combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{2 - t(s+1)}{2(s+1)}
\]
4. Simplify if possible. In this case, the expression can be left as is or expanded in the numerator:
\[
\frac{2 - ts - t}{2(s+1)} = \frac{2 - t(s+1)}{2(s+1)}
\]

Let's examine the options:

A: \( \frac{1-t}{2(s+1)} \)  
B: \( \frac{1-s t}{2(s+1)} \)  
C: \( \frac{1-t}{s-1} \)  
D: \( \frac{2-t(s+1)}{2(s+1)} \)

## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A suggests a misunderstanding in combining the fractions or in simplifying, as it doesn't correctly account for the terms in the numerators.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B also seems to result from incorrect manipulation, possibly misinterpreting the subtraction or the terms involved.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C indicates a significant misunderstanding, possibly with the common denominator or the signs, as it changes \(s+1\) to \(s-1\), which doesn't align with the original expression.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D matches the correct manipulation and simplification of the given expression.

## 5: Ability Level Predictions
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly combine fractions or forget to find a common denominator. Option C seems particularly tempting due to a possible mistake in handling \(s+1\).  
  - A: 20%  
  - B: 15%  
  - C: 40%  
  - D: 25%

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to get the common denominator right but could stumble on simplifying or correctly subtracting the fractions.  
  - A: 30%  
  - B: 25%  
  - C: 20%  
  - D: 25%

- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand algebraic manipulations well and are less likely to make simple mistakes. They should find the correct common denominator and combine fractions accurately.  
  - A: 10%  
  - B: 5%  
  - C: 5%  
  - D: 80%

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only perform algebraic manipulations accurately but also efficiently. They are expected to choose the correct option with high confidence.  
  - A: 5%  
  - B: 0%  
  - C: 0%  
  - D: 95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
