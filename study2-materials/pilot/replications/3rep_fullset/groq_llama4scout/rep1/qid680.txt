To approach this question, let's first analyze the content and then predict the performance of students at different ability levels.

The question involves factorising a quadratic expression \( p^{2} + 16p \). The correct factorisation is \( p(p + 16) \), but both Jo and Paul provide different factorisations:

- Jo says \( p^{2}+16 p \equiv(p+4)(p+4) \)
- Paul says \( p^{2}+16 p \equiv p(p+4) \)

Let's evaluate their claims:

1. Jo's claim: \( (p+4)(p+4) = p^{2} + 8p + 16 \), which does not equal \( p^{2} + 16p \). So, Jo is incorrect.
2. Paul's claim: \( p(p+4) = p^{2} + 4p \), which also does not equal \( p^{2} + 16p \). So, Paul is incorrect.

Given this, the correct answer is \( D) Neither is correct \).

Now, let's predict the performance of students at different ability levels:

### below_basic
At this level, students may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and factorisation. They might not fully understand how to expand and compare expressions or might not know the correct method for factorising \( p^{2} + 16p \).

- A: Only Jo - Some might think Jo's method could be right due to a lack of understanding.
- B: Only Paul - Similarly, they might think Paul's is correct for the same reason.
- C: Both Jo and Paul - Some might mistakenly believe both are correct.
- D: Neither is correct - This requires understanding that neither Jo nor Paul factorised correctly.

Prediction: 
- A=30% (thinking Jo might be right due to partial understanding or misapplication of concepts)
- B=20% (similar reasoning)
- C=15% (students not critically evaluating the factorisations)
- D=35% (students who have a basic understanding that both are incorrect)

### basic
At this level, students have a foundational understanding of algebra and factorisation but might still make errors due to lack of practice or misunderstanding.

- They are more likely to recognise that Jo's and Paul's factorisations are incorrect but might still choose A, B, or C due to not fully checking the factorisations.

Prediction:
- A=20%
- B=15%
- C=10%
- D=55%

### proficient
Proficient students have a solid grasp of algebraic concepts and should be able to identify that both Jo and Paul's factorisations are incorrect.

- A and B: Lower percentages as they understand the mistakes.
- C: Very low percentage as they can see both are wrong.
- D: High percentage as they correctly identify neither.

Prediction:
- A=5%
- B=5%
- C=5%
- D=85%

### advanced
Advanced students not only understand the concepts but can also critically evaluate the given expressions.

- They will easily identify the errors in Jo's and Paul's factorisations.

Prediction:
- A=0%
- B=0%
- C=0%
- D=100%

So, the final predictions are:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=15% D=35%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
