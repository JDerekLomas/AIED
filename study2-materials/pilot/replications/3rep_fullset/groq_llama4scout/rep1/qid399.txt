To approach this question, let's first understand the concepts involved and then evaluate the potential for students at different ability levels to select the correct or incorrect options.

The question revolves around two algebraic expressions:
1. \(3h^2\)
2. \((3h)^2\)

Given \(h = 10\), let's calculate these expressions:
1. \(3h^2 = 3 \times 10^2 = 3 \times 100 = 300\)
2. \((3h)^2 = (3 \times 10)^2 = 30^2 = 900\)

So, when \(h = 10\), 
- \(3h^2 = 300\)
- \((3h)^2 = 900\)

Let's examine the options:
A: \(3h^2 = 300\) and \((3h)^2 = 300\) (Incorrect because \((3h)^2 = 900\), not 300)
B: \(3h^2 = 300\) and \((3h)^2 = 900\) (Correct)
C: \(3h^2 = 900\) and \((3h)^2 = 900\) (Incorrect because \(3h^2 = 300\), not 900)
D: \(3h^2 = 900\) and \((3h)^2 = 300\) (Incorrect because both values are incorrectly stated)

The common misconception here involves understanding the difference between \(3h^2\) and \((3h)^2\). The expression \((3h)^2\) is equivalent to \(9h^2\), not \(3h^2\), which can easily lead to errors if the order of operations and exponent rules are not well understood.

**Predictions by Ability Level:**

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and understanding of exponent rules. They might confuse the two expressions or not compute them accurately.
  - A: 40% (mistaking the correct calculation for an option that seems plausible)
  - B: 20% (getting it right by chance or correct calculation)
  - C: 20% (misinterpreting both expressions)
  - D: 20% (misinterpreting both expressions in a different way)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to confusion between \(3h^2\) and \((3h)^2\).
  - A: 30%
  - B: 40% (correct calculation)
  - C: 15%
  - D: 15%

- **Proficient:** These students understand algebraic expressions and can apply rules of exponents correctly.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 80% (correct understanding and calculation)
  - C: 5%
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately and efficiently.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 90% (strong understanding and accurate calculation)
  - C: 3%
  - D: 2%

Thus, the response in the required format:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
