To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about finding the length of one side of a square given its area, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question provides the area of a square as \(36 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}\) and asks for the length of one side of the square. The formula for the area of a square is side\(^2\) = area. Therefore, to find the side length, we take the square root of the area.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be confusing the operations or not understanding that the area of a square is the side length squared. Another might be incorrectly calculating or not recognizing the square root of 36.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(6 \mathrm{~mm}\) because \(\sqrt{36} = 6\).
- Option B: \(1296 \mathrm{~mm}\) seems to be \(36^2 \times 2\) or a miscalculation, not directly related to a simple mistake from the square root.
- Option C: \(18 \mathrm{~mm}\) could be a mistake if one thinks \(36 \times 2 = 72\) and then mistakenly halved or another incorrect operation.
- Option D: \(9 \mathrm{~mm}\) seems to be half of 18 or a confusion, as \(\sqrt{36} = 6\), not 9.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic mathematical operations or understanding of formulas. They might choose B or C due to a lack of understanding of squares and square roots or miscalculation. A=20% (correct but struggling), B=30% (random or mistaken calculation), C=30% (mistaken calculation), D=20% (guessing).
- **Basic:** Students here should have a grasp of basic formulas but might make simple errors. A=60% (correct), B=15% (miscalculation), C=15% (miscalculation), D=10% (guessing or simple error).
- **Proficient:** These students should easily solve the problem. A=90% (correct), B=5% (unlikely but possible mistake), C=3% (unlikely mistake), D=2% (guessing).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts and rarely make errors. A=98% (correct), B=1% (extremely unlikely), C=1% (extremely unlikely), D=0% (no guess or error expected).

The best answer is A. 

Below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
Basic: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
Proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
Advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
