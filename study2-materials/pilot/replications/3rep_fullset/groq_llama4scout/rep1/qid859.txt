## Step 1: Analyzing the Question
The given equation is \(12d - 3 = 6d + 3\). This is a linear equation that requires solving for \(d\). The question asks students to solve for \(d\) and choose the correct solution from the given options.

## 2: Solving the Equation
To solve the equation \(12d - 3 = 6d + 3\), first, we want to get all the \(d\) terms on one side and the constants on the other. Subtracting \(6d\) from both sides gives \(6d - 3 = 3\). Adding \(3\) to both sides gives \(6d = 6\). Dividing both sides by \(6\) gives \(d = 1\).

## 3: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception in solving equations is not performing operations correctly on both sides, which can lead to incorrect solutions. However, in this specific question, the equation is straightforward, and the solution does not seem to lend itself to common algebraic mistakes that would lead to the other options provided, given that \(d=1\) is a simple and integer solution.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not correctly isolate \(d\) or make simple arithmetic mistakes. Given the simplicity of the solution (\(d = 1\)), and assuming they attempt to solve it, they might be more likely to choose an option that seems simple or matches a mistake they've made. \(d=1\) seems straightforward, but they might struggle to get there. Let's assume A=20%, B=40%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level should be able to handle basic algebra. They might still make occasional mistakes but should largely understand how to solve linear equations. The correct answer, \(d=1\), should be within their reach, but they might still select incorrect options due to careless mistakes. Let's assume A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level are comfortable with algebraic manipulations and should easily solve the equation. The chances of selecting the wrong option should be low. Let's assume A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are not only proficient but can also handle more complex algebra. They should have no trouble solving this equation and selecting the correct option. Let's assume A=2%, B=95%, C=2%, D=1%.
