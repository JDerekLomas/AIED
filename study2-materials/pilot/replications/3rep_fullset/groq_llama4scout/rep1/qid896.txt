To approach this question, let's first understand what makes an equation "related" to the original equation \(x + y = 12\). A related linear equation would be one that can be derived from the original equation through valid algebraic manipulations, such as multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction of the same value to both sides of the equation.

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's Equation
Tom starts with \(x + y = 12\) and multiplies every term by 3 to get \(3x + 3y = 36\). This is a valid algebraic manipulation. Multiplying both sides of an equation by the same non-zero number yields an equivalent equation. Therefore, Tom's equation is indeed related to the original equation.

## 2: Analyze Katie's Equation
Katie starts with \(x + y = 12\) and transforms it into \(x + 2y = 24\). To see if this is valid, let's examine the steps she could have taken. If she multiplied the entire original equation by 2, she would get \(2x + 2y = 24\), which is not what she wrote. However, if we subtract \(x\) from both sides of the original equation, we get \(y = 12 - x\). Katie's equation doesn't directly follow from a simple multiplication or division of the original equation by a constant. Let's check if it aligns with properties of linear equations. The original equation is \(x + y = 12\). Katie's equation is \(x + 2y = 24\). We can see that if we subtract the original equation from Katie's equation, we get \(y = 12\), which does not logically follow from the original equation without additional information. However, to assess its validity directly: if \(x + y = 12\), then doubling it gives \(2x + 2y = 24\), and subtracting the original equation from this result yields \(x + y = 12\), which doesn't help. Directly checking: \(x + 2y = 24\) can be rearranged as \(x + y + y = 24\) or \((x + y) + y = 24\). Substituting \(x + y = 12\) into this gives \(12 + y = 24\), or \(y = 12\). This implies \(x = 0\), which doesn't universally apply to \(x + y = 12\). So, Katie's manipulation seems incorrect for generating a "related" equation in the context usually taught.

## 3: Evaluate the Options
- **Tom's equation** is clearly related.
- **Katie's equation** does not directly derive from standard algebraic manipulations that would make it obviously related without assuming specific values for \(x\) or \(y\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students might not understand what makes an equation "related." They might not recognize Tom's valid manipulation but could incorrectly assume Katie's is valid due to misunderstanding algebraic rules. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 15\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(D = 35\%\)
- **Basic**: Students should recognize Tom's valid manipulation. They might be confused by Katie's equation but should start to see that it's not a standard transformation. \(A = 40\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 40\%\), \(D = 10\%\)
- **Proficient**: These students should easily recognize Tom's equation as related and see that Katie's is not through standard algebraic manipulations. \(A = 80\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 5\%\)
- **Advanced**: Students will quickly identify Tom's correct manipulation and recognize Katie's does not follow from standard operations that preserve the equation's solutions. \(A = 90\%\), \(B = 0\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 5\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
