To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding that students might have.

The question presents a rhombus drawn on a grid and asks what shape is formed when joining the midpoints of the sides of the rhombus. 

## Step 1: Understanding the properties of a rhombus and midpoints
A rhombus is a type of polygon that has four equal sides. It has the property that the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. When joining the midpoints of the sides of any quadrilateral, the resulting figure is a parallelogram.

## 2: Determining the shape formed by joining midpoints of a rhombus
Given that a rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at right angles and bisecting each other, joining the midpoints of its sides creates a parallelogram with sides that are parallel to the diagonals of the rhombus. Because the diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles, the sides of the parallelogram formed are perpendicular, making it a rectangle.

## 3: Anticipating student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand the properties of a rhombus or the effect of joining the midpoints of its sides. They might choose any option without a clear understanding, but a common misconception could lead them to choose B (Rhombus) as it's the original shape, or they might not recognize the properties leading to A (Square) if they mistakenly think all rectangles are squares.

- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding of shapes. They might recall that joining midpoints creates a similar figure or a parallelogram but might not directly infer it's a rectangle without visualizing. They could lean towards B (Rhombus) due to familiarity with the original shape.

- **Proficient:** These students understand properties of quadrilaterals, including rhombuses. They should recognize that joining midpoints of any quadrilateral creates a parallelogram and, specifically for a rhombus, because its diagonals intersect at right angles, the result is a rectangle. So, they are likely to choose D (Rectangle).

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the geometric properties but are also likely to have explored proofs or have a deep understanding of why joining the midpoints results in a rectangle for a rhombus. They are very likely to choose D (Rectangle).

## 4: Estimating percentages
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (mistaking for a square due to lack of understanding), B=40% (choosing the original shape), C=10% (unlikely), D=30% (some understanding leading to rectangle).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=30%, C=5%, D=55% (starting to understand the parallelogram and properties).
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=15%, C=5%, D=75% (clear understanding of properties).
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=5%, C=0%, D=95% (strong understanding).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=5% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=15% C=5% D=75%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
