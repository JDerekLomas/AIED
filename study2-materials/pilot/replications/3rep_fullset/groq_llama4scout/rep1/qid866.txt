To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it may pose.

The question requires students to understand the concept of negative numbers and how to calculate the distance between two points on a number line. Asha's office is on level 7, and her car is parked on level -2. To find out how many floors Asha needs to go down to get from the office to her car, students need to calculate the difference between 7 and -2.

## Step 1: Understand the Calculation
The correct calculation to find out how many floors Asha needs to go down is \( 7 - (-2) \). This can be simplified to \( 7 + 2 = 9 \) floors.

## 2: Identify Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be that students forget to change the subtraction of a negative number into an addition, leading to \( 7 - 2 = 5 \) floors. Another potential error could be simply subtracting the levels without considering the direction, but given the straightforward nature of the question, this seems less likely.

## 3: Analyze Option Choices
- Option A: \( 10 \) floors. This seems too high and not directly related to a simple calculation error from the correct method.
- Option B: \( 5 \) floors. This could result from a misconception where students incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the levels.
- Option C: \( 9 \) floors. This is the correct answer based on the calculation \( 7 - (-2) = 9 \).
- Option D: \( 7 \) floors. This might be chosen by students who misunderstand the question or make a simple arithmetic error.

## 4: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic number line concepts and negative numbers. They might choose options based on incorrect understanding or simple arithmetic errors. \( A=20\% \), \( B=40\% \), \( C=20\% \), \( D=20\% \)
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors with negative numbers or direction. \( A=10\% \), \( B=30\% \), \( C=50\% \), \( D=10\% \)
- **Proficient:** These students understand negative numbers and can perform the calculation correctly. \( A=5\% \), \( B=10\% \), \( C=80\% \), \( D=5\% \)
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are confident and accurate with calculations involving negative numbers. \( A=0\% \), \( B=0\% \), \( C=95\% \), \( D=5\% \)

The best answer is C. 

Below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
Basic: A=10% B=30% C=50% D=10%
Proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
