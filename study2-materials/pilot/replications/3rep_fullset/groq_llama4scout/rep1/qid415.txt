## Step 1: Understand the sequence and the claims
The sequence is given by \(7n + 5\), where \(n\) is an integer. Jo claims that 149 is a term in the sequence, and Paul claims that 150 is a term in the sequence.

## 2: Check Jo's claim
To verify Jo's claim, we need to see if there exists an integer \(n\) such that \(7n + 5 = 149\). Subtracting 5 from both sides gives \(7n = 144\). Dividing both sides by 7 gives \(n = 144 / 7 = 20.57\), which is not an integer. Therefore, Jo is incorrect.

## 3: Check Paul's claim
To verify Paul's claim, we need to see if there exists an integer \(n\) such that \(7n + 5 = 150\). Subtracting 5 from both sides gives \(7n = 145\). Dividing both sides by 7 gives \(n = 145 / 7 = 20.71\), which is not an integer. Therefore, Paul is incorrect.

## 4: Analyze the question for potential misconceptions
The question requires students to understand the nature of a linear sequence defined by \(7n + 5\) and to check if specific numbers can be terms of the sequence by solving for \(n\). A common misconception might involve not checking if \(n\) is an integer or misinterpreting how to substitute values into the sequence formula.

## 5: Consider student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and not fully understand the sequence or how to verify if a number is a term. They might incorrectly assume both or either is correct without proper calculation or understanding of integer solutions. Expect a high percentage of incorrect answers, possibly distributed across A, B, and C, with a significant portion choosing D due to a lack of understanding.

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding of algebra but might make errors in calculation or not fully grasp the requirement for \(n\) to be an integer. They might attempt to solve for \(n\) but could make arithmetic mistakes. Expect a significant portion to incorrectly choose A or B.

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid understanding of algebra and should be able to accurately solve for \(n\) and understand the necessity of \(n\) being an integer. They are likely to choose D, recognizing that neither 149 nor 150 yields an integer \(n\).

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the algebraic process but are also likely to quickly identify that both claims can be disproven by showing \(n\) is not an integer for either case. They should confidently choose D.

## 6: Predict percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (Jo seems plausible), B=30% (Paul seems plausible), C=20% (both), D=20% (neither).
- **Basic**: A=40%, B=40%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=10%, C=5%, D=75%.
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=5%, C=0%, D=90%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=40% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
