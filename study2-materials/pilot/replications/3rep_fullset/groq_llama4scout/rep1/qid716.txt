## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the bearing of North-West on a compass. The standard bearings are measured clockwise from North, with North being \(0^{\circ}\) or \(360^{\circ}\), East being \(90^{\circ}\), South being \(180^{\circ}\), and West being \(270^{\circ}\). North-West is halfway between North and West.

## 2: Calculating North-West Bearing
To find the bearing of North-West, we calculate the midpoint between North (\(0^{\circ}\)) and West (\(270^{\circ}\)). The bearing is \(\frac{0^{\circ} + 270^{\circ}}{2} = 135^{\circ}\). However, the question provides options in a multiple-choice format, and we need to consider common misconceptions or errors students might make.

## 3: Analyzing Possible Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the direction or the method of measuring bearings. Some students might think of North-West as being \(45^{\circ}\) from North towards West in a linear sense, not understanding that bearings are measured clockwise from North. This would suggest a bearing of \(315^{\circ}\) for North-West, as \(360^{\circ} - 45^{\circ} = 315^{\circ}\).

## 4: Evaluating the Options
- Option A: \(270^{\circ}\) corresponds to West, not North-West.
- Option B: \(225^{\circ}\) is South-West, not North-West.
- Option C: \(045^{\circ}\) corresponds to North-East, not North-West.
- Option D: \(315^{\circ}\) corresponds to North-West, as it's \(45^{\circ}\) short of \(360^{\circ}\) (or North).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand bearings or directions. They might confuse West with North-West or not accurately calculate the bearing. Expect a high chance of error, with possibly A=20% (thinking West is North-West), B=20% (random or South-West confusion), C=20% (confusing with North-East), and D=40% (some understanding of directional terms).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make mistakes. They are likely to eliminate A and C but might confuse B and D. Expect A=10%, B=30%, C=10%, and D=50%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand bearings well and can calculate them. They should easily identify D as the correct answer. Expect A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, and D=85%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding of the concept and are less likely to make errors. They should consistently choose D. Expect A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, and D=100%.

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Given the analysis, the predicted percentages are:
- below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
- basic: A=10% B=30% C=10% D=50%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=10% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
