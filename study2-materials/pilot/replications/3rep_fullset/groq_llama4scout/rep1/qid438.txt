## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question presents a velocity-time graph representing the first 5 seconds of Mo's journey, which starts at home. The task is to determine at what time Mo first starts traveling at \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \).

## 2: Analyzing the graph
The graph has three sections:
1. A straight slanted line from (0,0) to (1, 4), indicating an increase in velocity from 0 to \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) in 1 second.
2. A horizontal line from (1, 4) to (3, 4), showing a constant velocity of \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) for 2 seconds.
3. A slanted line from (3, 4) to (5, 0), indicating a decrease in velocity from \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) to 0 in 2 seconds.

## 3: Identifying when Mo first travels at \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \)
From the graph, it's clear that Mo first reaches \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) at \( t = 1 \) second, as this is where the velocity line intersects \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) for the first time.

## 4: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with interpreting graphs or understanding the concept of velocity. They might incorrectly read the graph or misunderstand the question. Given the simplicity of the graph and the question, most might still manage to identify the correct time but could be confused by the graph's layout. However, the clear and simple nature of the graph and question might still lead a significant portion to choose A=80% (as it's the first point where velocity is 4m/s), B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better understanding of graphs and basic physics concepts. They should be able to identify that Mo starts traveling at \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) at \( t = 1 \) second. Thus, A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of the concepts and can accurately interpret the graph. They will easily identify that Mo first starts traveling at \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) at \( t = 1 \) second. So, A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the concepts but are also less likely to make careless mistakes. They will accurately determine that Mo first travels at \( 4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) at \( t = 1 \) second. Hence, A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

## 5: Finalizing predictions
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- basic: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
- advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
basic: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
