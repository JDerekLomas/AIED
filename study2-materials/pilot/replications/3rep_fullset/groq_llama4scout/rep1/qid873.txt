## Step 1: Analyze the question
The question asks students to simplify the given algebraic expression \( \frac{4 t^{2}-1}{4 t+2} \) if possible. The expression can be simplified by factoring the numerator and then reducing.

## 2: Factor the numerator
The numerator \( 4t^{2} - 1 \) can be factored as a difference of squares: \( (2t - 1)(2t + 1) \).

## 3: Rewrite the expression with the factored numerator
The expression becomes \( \frac{(2t - 1)(2t + 1)}{4t + 2} \).

## 4: Factor the denominator
The denominator \( 4t + 2 \) can be factored as \( 2(2t + 1) \).

## 5: Rewrite the expression with both numerator and denominator factored
The expression now is \( \frac{(2t - 1)(2t + 1)}{2(2t + 1)} \).

## 6: Identify potential simplification
Students can see that \( (2t + 1) \) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, suggesting that the expression can be simplified by canceling these terms.

## 7: Simplify the expression
After canceling \( (2t + 1) \), the expression simplifies to \( \frac{2t - 1}{2} \) or \( t - \frac{1}{2} \).

## 8: Consider common misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not properly factoring the numerator or not canceling terms correctly. However, the structure of this question and the straightforward nature of the factorization and cancellation might mitigate such errors for many students.

## 9: Evaluate answer choices
- A: \( t - 1 \) seems incorrect based on our simplification.
- B: \( t + \frac{1}{2} \) seems incorrect based on our simplification.
- C: \( t - \frac{1}{2} \) matches our simplification.
- D: Does not simplify is incorrect because the expression can be simplified.

## 10: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with factoring and simplifying. They might not correctly factor the numerator or might not see the cancellation opportunity. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, potentially A or B, and a significant portion choosing D due to confusion.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand basic algebraic manipulations but could still make mistakes in factoring or see the simplification but choose incorrectly (e.g., A or B). Some might get it right, choosing C.
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to correctly factor and simplify, choosing C. A smaller percentage might choose D if they incorrectly believe the expression cannot be simplified.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to easily simplify the expression and choose C. Errors would be minimal.

## 11: Assign percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic**: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
