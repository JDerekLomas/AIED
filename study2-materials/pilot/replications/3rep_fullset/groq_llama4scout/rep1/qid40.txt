## Step 1: Understand the question
The question describes a scenario where Lethna pays different rates for electricity based on the units used: one rate for the first 100 units and another rate for any units beyond that. The rates are £0.25 per unit for the first 100 units and £0.10 per unit for any additional units.

## 2: Calculate the cost
To find out how much Lethna must pay for using a total of 1000 units of electricity, we need to calculate the cost in two parts: the cost for the first 100 units and the cost for the remaining 900 units.
- Cost for the first 100 units = 100 * £0.25 = £25
- Cost for the remaining 900 units = 900 * £0.10 = £90
- Total cost = £25 + £90 = £115

## 3: Evaluate the answer choices
Given the calculation, the correct answer is £115, which corresponds to option C.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of tiered pricing or with performing the calculations. They might incorrectly apply the rates or make calculation errors. Option A (£130) could be a plausible incorrect answer if students mistakenly add a certain amount to the correct calculation or miscalculate. Option B (£250) seems too high unless students incorrectly use the higher rate for all units or make a significant calculation mistake. Option D (£175) could be chosen if students apply the wrong rate for part of the usage or miscalculate significantly.

- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to understand the pricing structure and perform basic calculations. However, they might still make mistakes in calculating the total cost, especially if they misunderstand how to apply the rates. They are more likely to choose the correct option C (£115) but might also consider other options due to calculation errors.

- **Proficient**: Students at this level should easily understand the pricing structure and accurately calculate the total cost. They are likely to choose option C (£115) as it matches the correct calculation.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only understand the pricing structure but also be able to apply it correctly without errors. They should confidently choose option C (£115).

## 5: Estimate percentages for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (miscalculation leading to this amount), B=10% (overestimation), C=40% (correct but potentially by chance), D=30% (another miscalculation).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=0%, C=95%, D=0%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=100%, D=0%.

The best answer is C.
