To approach this question, let's first understand the concept being tested: reflection across a vertical line, in this case, \(x = -1\).

## Step 1: Understanding Reflection Across a Line
When reflecting a point across a vertical line \(x = a\), the x-coordinate of the reflected point is \(2a - x\), where \(x\) is the x-coordinate of the original point. The y-coordinate remains unchanged.

## 2: Applying the Concept to the Given Problem
The point \(E\) is at \((3, 3)\), and the line of reflection is \(x = -1\). To find the reflected point, we calculate the new x-coordinate as \(2 \times (-1) - 3 = -2 - 3 = -5\). The y-coordinate remains \(3\). So, the reflected point of \(E\) is \((-5, 3)\).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \((-3, 3)\)
- Option B: \((-5, 3)\)
- Option C: \((3, -3)\)
- Option D: \((3, -5)\)

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of reflection or applying the formula. They might mistakenly think the reflection across \(x = -1\) simply changes the sign of the x-coordinate or misapply the reflection formula. Expect a significant number to choose A or C/D due to confusion.
  - A: 30% (guessing or misunderstanding reflection)
  - B: 20% (correct but let's see if they actually get it)
  - C: 20% (misunderstanding reflection affects y-coordinate)
  - D: 30% (similarly mistaken)

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic geometric transformations but might make calculation errors.
  - A: 15% (some still confused)
  - B: 60% (understand and correctly apply reflection)
  - C: 15% (think reflection affects y-coordinate)
  - D: 10% (calculate incorrectly)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept well and can apply it accurately.
  - A: 5% (minor calculation mistake or confusion)
  - B: 85% (accurately reflect the point)
  - C: 5% ( mistake in applying transformation rules)
  - D: 5% (similar mistake)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also reason about it deeply. They are less likely to make mistakes.
  - A: 0% (no chance of selecting incorrect option due to deep understanding)
  - B: 95% (confidently and accurately reflect the point)
  - C: 0% (no chance of this error)
  - D: 5% (extremely rare mistake or checking alternative)

## 5: Conclusion
Based on the steps above, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
