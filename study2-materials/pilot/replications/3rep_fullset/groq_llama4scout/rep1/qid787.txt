## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception
The question requires students to evaluate the first step in solving a linear equation, specifically focusing on whether adding or subtracting the same value to both sides of the equation is valid. The equation given is \(2v - 5 = 6v - 3\). Jo and Paul propose different first steps: Jo suggests \(2v - 8 = 6v\), and Paul suggests \(2v = 6v - 8\). We need to assess if either, both, or neither of their suggestions is correct.

## 2: Analyze Jo's suggestion
Jo's suggestion is to write \(2v - 8 = 6v\). To see if this is valid, let's compare it to the original equation. If we subtract 3 from both sides of the original equation, we get \(2v - 5 - 3 = 6v - 3 - 3\), which simplifies to \(2v - 8 = 6v - 6\). Jo's suggestion does not match this correct manipulation because it incorrectly states \(2v - 8 = 6v\), omitting the -6 on the right side.

## 3: Analyze Paul's suggestion
Paul suggests \(2v = 6v - 8\). Let's see if this can be derived from the original equation. Adding 5 to both sides gives \(2v = 6v + 2\). Then, subtracting 6v from both sides gives \(-4v = 2\). However, to directly assess Paul's step: if we subtract \(6v\) from both sides of the original equation, we get \(2v - 6v - 5 = 6v - 6v - 3\), which simplifies to \(-4v - 5 = -3\). Adding 5 to both sides then yields \(-4v = 2\), and multiplying by -1 gives \(4v = -2\). To directly compare with Paul's step, let's correctly manipulate the original equation to see if Paul's form can be achieved directly: The original step to get to Paul's form isn't straightforward without additional operations. Paul's form \(2v = 6v - 8\) can be evaluated by seeing if adding 5 to both sides and then subtracting \(6v\) from both sides yields a similar form. The direct manipulation to Paul's form from the original equation isn't standard.

## 4: Correctly solve and evaluate suggestions
To solve \(2v - 5 = 6v - 3\), let's correctly manipulate it:
1. Subtract \(2v\) from both sides: \(-5 = 4v - 3\)
2. Add 3 to both sides: \(-2 = 4v\)
3. Divide by 4: \(v = -\frac{1}{2}\)

Jo's step: \(2v - 8 = 6v\) implies subtracting 3 from both sides and then adjusting, which isn't standard.
Paul's step: \(2v = 6v - 8\) can be checked by manipulation:
- Original equation: \(2v - 5 = 6v - 3\)
- Add 5 to both sides: \(2v = 6v + 2\)
- Subtract \(6v\): \(-4v = 2\)
- This doesn't directly align with Paul's but let's fix that:
- If we do \(2v - 5 = 6v - 3\), add 3 to both: \(2v - 2 = 6v\)
- Subtract \(2v\): \(-2 = 4v\)
The accurate approach doesn't directly validate Jo or Paul without error.

## 5: Direct evaluation of Jo and Paul's claims
- Jo claims \(2v - 8 = 6v\). Let's verify: If \(2v - 5 = 6v - 3\), subtract 3 from both sides: \(2v - 8 = 6v - 6\), not \(6v\).
- Paul claims \(2v = 6v - 8\). From \(2v - 5 = 6v - 3\), add 5: \(2v = 6v + 2\), then subtract \(6v\): \(-4v = 2\), multiply by -1: \(4v = -2\), or \(2v = -1\), which doesn't match Paul's form directly.

## 6: Predict student responses
Given the manipulations:
- **Jo's error**: Incorrectly adjusts the equation.
- **Paul's error**: Similarly, does not accurately reflect a standard first step.

## 7: Assess difficulty and likely student errors
The question tests understanding of linear equation balancing. Students might struggle with applying operations to both sides equally.
