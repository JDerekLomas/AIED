To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

The question requires the expansion of the expression \( (x-2)^{3} \). The correct expansion can be achieved using the binomial theorem or by manually multiplying \( (x-2) \) by itself three times. The correct expansion is \( x^{3} - 6x^{2} + 12x - 8 \), which corresponds to option C.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Expansion
The correct expansion of \( (x-2)^{3} \) is \( (x-2)(x-2)(x-2) \) which equals \( (x^{2} - 4x + 4)(x-2) \) and further simplifies to \( x^{3} - 2x^{2} - 4x^{2} + 8x + 4x - 8 \) or \( x^{3} - 6x^{2} + 12x - 8 \). This corresponds to option C.

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect application of the formula \( (a-b)^{3} = a^{3} - 3a^{2}b + 3ab^{2} - b^{3} \), which for \( (x-2)^{3} \) would correctly yield \( x^{3} - 3x^{2}(2) + 3x(2)^{2} - 2^{3} \) or \( x^{3} - 6x^{2} + 12x - 8 \). Another potential error could be in the signs or the powers of \( x \) and the constant term.

## 3: Assessing Option A
Option A, \( x^{3} - 8 \), seems to ignore the middle terms and only consider the first and last terms of the expansion, which might appeal to students who misunderstand how to expand a cubic expression or forget to apply the binomial coefficients correctly.

## 4: Assessing Option B
Option B, \( x^{3} - 6x^{2} - 6x - 8 \), might be chosen by students who incorrectly calculate the middle term of the expansion, possibly due to a miscalculation of the binomial coefficients or incorrect handling of negative signs.

## 5: Assessing Option D
Option D, \( x^{3} - 12x^{2} + 6x - 8 \), could be selected by students who misapply the binomial expansion formula, perhaps incorrectly doubling the coefficient of \( x^{2} \) or miscalculating other terms.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle significantly with algebraic manipulations. They might opt for A because it seems simple and doesn't require detailed expansion, or they might randomly select an option. The prediction could be: A=40% (simple, incorrect), B=20% (random or miscalculation), C=20% (some understanding but struggle), D=20% (another incorrect option).
- **Basic:** Students at this level have foundational knowledge but may make calculation errors. They are more likely to attempt the expansion but might end up with B or D due to calculation mistakes. Prediction: A=20%, B=30%, C=40%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are expected to apply the binomial theorem or expand the expression correctly. They might still make minor errors, leading to B or D, but are more likely to choose C. Prediction: A=5%, B=15%, C=75%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to get the question correct with ease. Prediction: A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=15% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
