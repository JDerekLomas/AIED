## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to find the gradient (\(m\)) of a line given in the form \(y = mx + c\), where the line passes through the points \((0,0)\) and \((6,-4)\). The \(y\)-intercept and \(x\)-intercept are both \((0,0)\), indicating the line passes through the origin.

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
A common misconception might be that since the line passes through \((0,0)\), it must be the equation \(y = 0\) or a similar simplistic view. However, given another point \((6,-4)\), students should calculate the gradient using \(m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\).

## 3: Calculating the Gradient
Using the points \((0,0)\) and \((6,-4)\), the gradient \(m = \frac{-4 - 0}{6 - 0} = \frac{-4}{6} = -\frac{2}{3}\).

## 4: Evaluating Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of gradient or misinterpret the coordinates. They might incorrectly assume \(m = 0\) because the line seems to "go down" or not understand how to apply the formula. Option D (\( -\frac{2}{3} \)) is correct, but these students might choose A, B, or C due to miscalculation or misunderstanding. Given the simplicity of the calculation and the clear indication that the line is not horizontal or vertical, a significant portion might still guess or incorrectly calculate: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%.
- **Basic**: Students here should be familiar with the gradient formula. However, they might still make careless mistakes or not fully understand the application. The correct answer is straightforward to calculate, so: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to understand the gradient formula well and apply it correctly. The calculation is straightforward: \(m = -\frac{2}{3}\), so: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are not only proficient but also able to apply their knowledge in more complex situations. They would easily identify \(m = -\frac{2}{3}\) and not be tempted by incorrect options: A=2% B=2% C=2% D=94%.

## 5: Conclusion
Based on the understanding of the question and the levels of student ability:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
- **Basic**: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **Advanced**: A=2% B=2% C=2% D=94%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=2% D=94%
