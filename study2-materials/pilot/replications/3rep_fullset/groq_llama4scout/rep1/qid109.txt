To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie and evaluate their correctness based on the properties of quadratic equations and their graphs.

1. **Tom's statement**: A quadratic expression that cannot be factorised will not intercept the \( x \) axis.
   - This statement is not necessarily true. A quadratic expression that cannot be easily factorized (or factorized at all using simple integer or rational roots) can still intercept the \( x \) axis. The ability to factorize a quadratic equation into integers or simple fractions does not determine if its graph intersects the \( x \) axis; rather, it's about the discriminant (\( b^2 - 4ac \)) of the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). If the discriminant is positive, the equation has two distinct real roots, meaning the graph intersects the \( x \) axis at two points. If it's zero, there's exactly one real root (the graph touches the \( x \) axis). If it's negative, there are no real roots, and the graph does not intersect the \( x \) axis.

2. **Katie's statement**: A graph of a quadratic that does not intercept the \( x \) axis cannot be factorised.
   - This statement is correct. A quadratic graph that does not intercept the \( x \) axis implies that the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) has no real roots, which means its discriminant (\( b^2 - 4ac \)) is negative. A quadratic equation with no real roots cannot be factored into the product of two binomials with real coefficients. However, it's worth noting that it can be expressed in a form that involves complex numbers, but in the real number system, it cannot be factorized into linear factors.

Given these explanations:

- **Tom's statement** is incorrect because not being able to factorize a quadratic does not prevent it from intersecting the \( x \) axis; it depends on the roots.
- **Katie's statement** is correct in implying that if a quadratic's graph does not intersect the \( x \) axis, it cannot be factored into real linear factors.

Let's predict the student responses based on ability levels:

### below_basic
At this level, students may struggle with understanding the implications of factorisation and the nature of roots.
- A (Only Tom): 30% (misunderstanding of basic concepts)
- B (Only Katie): 20% (partial understanding)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 10% (unlikely to understand both correctly)
- D (Neither is correct): 40% (lack of understanding)

### basic
Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might not fully grasp the nuances.
- A (Only Tom): 20% (still some misconceptions)
- B (Only Katie): 40% (starting to understand the relationship)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 5% (unlikely both are correct)
- D (Neither is correct): 35% (some understanding that Tom is incorrect, but not fully)

### proficient
These students have a solid grasp of quadratic equations and graphs.
- A (Only Tom): 10% (understand Tom is wrong)
- B (Only Katie): 60% (understand Katie's correctness)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 5% (know Tom is wrong)
- D (Neither is correct): 25% (some might still be unsure)

### advanced
At this level, students have a deep understanding and can apply concepts accurately.
- A (Only Tom): 5% (know Tom's statement is flawed)
- B (Only Katie): 70% (clear understanding of Katie's correctness and Tom's flaw)
- C (Both Tom and Katie): 0% (understand Tom is incorrect)
- D (Neither is correct): 25% (a few might question based on deeper understanding)

So, the predictions in the exact format requested are:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
advanced: A=5% B=70% C=0% D=25%
