To solve this, let's first analyze the question and then predict the student responses based on their ability levels.

## Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question provides two scenarios:
1. Chris orders 2 cups of tea and a cake for £1.40.
2. Amy orders 4 cups of tea and a cake for £2.20.

We need to find the cost of one cup of tea.

## 2: Solve the Question
Let's denote the cost of one cup of tea as \(T\) and the cost of a cake as \(C\).

From Chris's order: \(2T + C = 1.40\)

From Amy's order: \(4T + C = 2.20\)

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:
\(2T = 0.80\)

Dividing by 2:
\(T = 0.40\) or \(40p\)

## 3: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with setting up equations or subtracting one equation from another. They might not even attempt to solve it algebraically or could mistakenly add the costs or not account for the cake properly. Given the numbers, a common mistake could be not realizing the difference in tea cups directly correlates to a specific price difference. 
  - A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
  
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to understand the problem and possibly set up simple equations but might struggle with solving them efficiently. They might guess or use trial and error.
  - A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%

- **Proficient**: These students should be able to set up and solve the equations easily. However, careless mistakes could still occur.
  - A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only solve it correctly but also do so efficiently. Mistakes at this level would be rare.
  - A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%

The best answer is C. 

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%
