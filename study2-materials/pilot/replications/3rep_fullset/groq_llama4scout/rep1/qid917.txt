To approach this question, let's first analyze the misconceptions and the mathematical operations involved.

The original equation is \( t = \sqrt{u + 9} \). To make \( u \) the subject, we need to isolate \( u \) on one side of the equation.

## Step 1: Analyzing Tom's Suggestion
Tom suggests \( t = \sqrt{u} + 3 \) as a correct first line of working. Let's see if this can lead to a valid rearrangement. If we square both sides of Tom's suggestion, we get \( t^2 = (\sqrt{u} + 3)^2 = u + 6\sqrt{u} + 9 \). This does not directly relate to the original equation \( t = \sqrt{u + 9} \) in a simple manner because it introduces an extra term \( 6\sqrt{u} \), making it not a straightforward first step to isolate \( u \) correctly from the original equation.

## 2: Analyzing Katie's Suggestion
Katie suggests \( t^2 = u + 9 \) as a correct first line of working. This directly follows from squaring both sides of the original equation: \( t^2 = (\sqrt{u + 9})^2 = u + 9 \). This step is algebraically correct and directly leads to isolating \( u \): \( u = t^2 - 9 \).

## 3: Evaluating Tom's Statement
Tom's statement \( t = \sqrt{u} + 3 \) does not correctly derive from \( t = \sqrt{u + 9} \) by standard algebraic manipulations without introducing errors. The correct manipulation to isolate \( u \) would not start with adding 3 to \( \sqrt{u} \) but rather squaring both sides as Katie suggested.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with algebraic manipulations and might not fully understand the process of making \( u \) the subject. They might incorrectly agree with Tom due to a lack of understanding of algebraic operations or mistakenly think both could be correct due to confusion. \( A = 30\% \), \( B = 40\% \), \( C = 15\% \), \( D = 15\% \)
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still fall into traps. They are likely to recognize Katie's method as correct but might be uncertain or incorrect about Tom's. \( A = 10\% \), \( B = 60\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 10\% \)
- **Proficient**: These students understand the algebra well and can see that Katie's suggestion is correct and leads directly to \( u = t^2 - 9 \). They are likely to spot that Tom's suggestion does not correctly derive from the original equation. \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 80\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 5\% \)
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and can quickly identify correct and incorrect manipulations. They will clearly see Katie's method as correct and Tom's as incorrect. \( A = 0\% \), \( B = 90\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 5\% \)

Given the analysis:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
