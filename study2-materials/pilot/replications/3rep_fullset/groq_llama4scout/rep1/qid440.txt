To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the task and the potential pitfalls for students at different ability levels.

The question requires students to read a thermometer and determine the temperature it shows. The thermometer scale provided ranges from 10 to -10 degrees Celsius, with equal intervals between 10 and 0 and between 0 and -10. The temperature marking is at 4 steps below 0.

## Step 1: Understanding the Thermometer Scale
The scale has 5 steps between 10 and 0 and 5 steps between 0 and -10. This implies that each step represents 2 degrees Celsius because 10 degrees divided into 5 parts equals 2 degrees per part.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve misinterpreting the scale or not accurately counting the steps. Students might incorrectly assume that the temperature decreases by 1 degree per step or misread the position of the thermometer.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(-8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\)
- Option B: \(-9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\)
- Option C: \(-4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\)
- Option D: \(-11^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\)

Given that the temperature is 4 steps below 0, and each step is 2 degrees Celsius, the temperature should be \(-8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with reading the thermometer or understanding the concept of negative temperatures. They might incorrectly count the steps or not understand the interval between them. Thus, they could be more likely to choose incorrect options like C, B, or D due to confusion.
- **Basic:** Students here might have a grasp of negative numbers but could still make errors in counting steps or understanding the scale, potentially leading to choices like B, C, or D.
- **Proficient:** These students are likely to understand the scale and accurately count the steps. However, a small percentage might still make a careless error, potentially choosing B or D.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are expected to accurately read the thermometer and calculate the temperature without issue, making A the correct choice.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (some can guess or have partial understanding), B=30% (common error), C=20% (misreading), D=10% (extreme error).
- **Basic:** A=60% (understand basic concept), B=20% (error in counting), C=10% (significant misreading), D=10% (another type of error).
- **Proficient:** A=90% (accurate reading), B=5% (minor error), C=3% (misinterpretation), D=2% (significant mistake).
- **Advanced:** A=98% (near-perfect understanding), B=1% (careless mistake), C=0.5% (unlikely), D=0.5% (very rare error).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
