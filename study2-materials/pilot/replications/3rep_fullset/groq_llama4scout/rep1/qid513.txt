To approach this question, let's first analyze the steps provided by Isaac and determine their correctness.

The original equation is \(15 = 2p - 4\).

## Step 1: Evaluate Step 1
To evaluate Step 1, we add 4 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \(p\).
\[15 + 4 = 2p - 4 + 4\]
This simplifies to:
\[19 = 2p\]
So, Step 1: \(11 = 2p\) is incorrect because it should be \(19 = 2p\), not \(11 = 2p\).

## Step 2: Evaluate Step 2
Given the correct equation after Step 1 should be \(19 = 2p\), to find \(p\), we divide both sides by 2.
\[p = \frac{19}{2}\]
\[p = 9.5\]
So, Step 2: \(22 = p\) is also incorrect because it suggests \(p = 22\), which does not follow from \(19 = 2p\).

## 3: Analysis for below_basic students
Students at this level may struggle with basic algebra and may not fully understand the process of solving equations. They might not even attempt to verify the steps or may make careless errors.
- They are likely to find both steps incorrect because they either don't understand the process or see the obvious mistake in step 1 and incorrectly assume step 2 is correct or both are wrong without thorough checking.
- Prediction: below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%

## 4: Analysis for basic students
Basic students have a grasp of simple algebra but might make mistakes in more complex problems or when steps are not straightforward.
- They will likely identify that Step 1 is incorrect because adding 4 to 15 gives 19, not 11. For Step 2, if they see \(19 = 2p\), they should realize \(p = 9.5\), not 22.
- Prediction: basic: A=15% B=10% C=5% D=70%

## 5: Analysis for proficient students
Proficient students are comfortable with algebra and can solve equations but might still fall into traps if the question is carefully crafted.
- These students should easily see that Step 1 is incorrect (\(19 = 2p\), not \(11 = 2p\)) and that Step 2, based on an incorrect Step 1, is also incorrect.
- Prediction: proficient: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%

## 6: Analysis for advanced students
Advanced students not only understand algebra well but can also critically evaluate given steps for correctness.
- They will immediately see both steps are incorrect: Step 1 because \(15 + 4 = 19\), not \(11\), and Step 2 because \(19 / 2 = 9.5\), not \(22\).
- Prediction: advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=5% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
