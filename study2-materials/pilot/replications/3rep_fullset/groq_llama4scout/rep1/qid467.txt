To predict how students at different ability levels would perform on this question, let's analyze the question itself and the common misconceptions or challenges it presents.

The question involves sharing a profit in a given ratio and finding the total amount received by both parties, given that one person receives a specific amount more than the other. The ratio given is \(9:5\), and Bill gets \(£72\) more than Mischa.

## Step 1: Understand the Ratio and Difference
The difference in the ratio parts between Bill and Mischa is \(9 - 5 = 4\) parts. This difference corresponds to \(£72\).

## 2: Calculate the Value of One Part
To find out how much money each part of the ratio represents, we divide the difference Bill gets over Mischa (\(£72\)) by the difference in their ratio parts (4 parts). So, \(£72 / 4 = £18\) per part.

## 3: Determine Each Person's Share
- Mischa's share: \(5 \times £18 = £90\)
- Bill's share: \(9 \times £18 = £162\)

## 4: Calculate the Total Amount Received
The total amount received is \(£90 + £162 = £252\).

## 5: Analyze Potential Misconceptions and Difficulty
A common misconception might involve directly using the ratio to find individual amounts without properly considering the difference given. However, this question's structure makes it relatively straightforward to solve if one recognizes that the \(£72\) difference corresponds to 4 parts of the ratio.

## 6: Predict Student Performance
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with setting up the equation or understanding the ratio. They might incorrectly calculate or not understand how to apply the ratio and difference. Expect a high chance of error, with many possibly choosing A or D due to miscalculation. \(A=40\% B=20\% C=20\% D=20\%\)
- **Basic:** These students can handle basic ratio problems but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They have a better chance of getting it right but might still struggle with the calculation. \(A=20\% B=15\% C=50\% D=15\%\)
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand ratios well and can apply them to solve problems. They are likely to calculate the total correctly. \(A=5\% B=5\% C=80\% D=10\%\)
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand ratios but can also apply them efficiently in complex problems. They are very likely to solve this correctly and quickly. \(A=0\% B=0\% C=90\% D=10\%\)

The best answer is C. 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
