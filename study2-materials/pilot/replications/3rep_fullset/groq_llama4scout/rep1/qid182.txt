To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question asks to factorize the expression \(p^{2} - 16\). This is a difference of squares, which can be factorized into \((p + 4)(p - 4)\). 

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
- A common misconception might be to think the expression is a perfect square trinomial or to incorrectly apply factorization rules.
- Option A, \((p-4)(p-4)\), suggests a misunderstanding that the expression is a perfect square trinomial, which it is not.
- Option C, \(p(p-16)\), suggests a simple factorization that does not recognize the difference of squares.
- Option D, "Does not factorise," indicates a lack of recognition of the difference of squares formula.

## 2: Analyzing the Expression
The given expression \(p^{2} - 16\) can be seen as a difference of squares since \(16 = 4^{2}\). The correct factorization, therefore, is \((p+4)(p-4)\), which corresponds to option B.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may not understand basic factorization techniques or recognize the difference of squares. They might opt for simple factorizations or think it doesn't factorize.
  - A: High (they might see it as a square)
  - B: Low (not recognizing the formula)
  - C: Medium (simple factorization attempt)
  - D: High (not knowing it can be factorized)

- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but might not always recognize patterns like the difference of squares.
  - A: Medium (still some might see it as a perfect square)
  - B: Medium (starting to recognize patterns)
  - C: Medium (attempting simple factorization)
  - D: Medium (some uncertainty)

- **Proficient:** These students are familiar with the difference of squares formula and should apply it correctly.
  - A: Low (recognize it's not a perfect square)
  - B: High (correct application of the formula)
  - C: Low (less likely to make simple factorization mistakes)
  - D: Low (know it can be factorized)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only know the formula but are also less likely to fall into common traps.
  - A: Very Low
  - B: Very High
  - C: Very Low
  - D: Very Low

## 4: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic:** A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
