To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing: the correct algebraic convention for representing division. The expression \( b \div a \) is to be represented using the correct algebraic notation. 

## Step 1: Understanding Algebraic Convention
In algebra, division is often represented as a fraction. For \( b \div a \), the correct representation is \( \frac{b}{a} \). This is a fundamental concept and is typically introduced early in algebra.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( \frac{b}{a} \) directly represents \( b \div a \), following the standard algebraic convention for division.
- Option B: \( a \div b \) reverses the order of division, which would be \( \frac{a}{b} \), not \( \frac{b}{a} \).
- Option C: \( \frac{a}{b} \) also misrepresents \( b \div a \), essentially giving \( a \div b \).
- Option D: \( ab \) suggests multiplication, not division.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic notation. They might confuse the operations or the order of variables. 
  - A: 40% (some might recognize the fraction form but could be unsure)
  - B: 30% (confusing the order)
  - C: 20% (similar confusion)
  - D: 10% (not understanding division notation)

- **Basic:** At this level, students are more familiar with algebraic notation but might still make careless mistakes.
  - A: 70% (recognize the correct fraction form)
  - B: 15% (some might still confuse the order)
  - C: 10% (similar)
  - D: 5% (less likely to confuse with multiplication)

- **Proficient:** Students here have a solid grasp of algebra and are less likely to make simple errors.
  - A: 90% (strong understanding of algebraic notation)
  - B: 5% (unlikely to confuse)
  - C: 3% (similarly unlikely)
  - D: 2% (very unlikely)

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand algebra well but are also familiar with more complex applications.
  - A: 95% (almost certain to get it right)
  - B: 2% (rarely confuse)
  - C: 2% (rarely)
  - D: 1% (extremely unlikely)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
