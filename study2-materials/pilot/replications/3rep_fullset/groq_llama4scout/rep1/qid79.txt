## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to interpret a graph of a quadratic equation \(y = x^{2} - x - 6\) and determine the solution set for \(y \geq 0\). The graph provided shows the parabola crossing the x-axis at \((-2, 0)\) and \((3, 0)\), and the y-axis at \((0, -6)\).

## 2: Identifying Key Features of the Graph
The roots of the equation, where \(y = 0\), are \(x = -2\) and \(x = 3\). This means the parabola intersects the x-axis at these points. For a quadratic equation of the form \(y = ax^{2} + bx + c\), where \(a > 0\), the parabola opens upwards. Thus, \(y \geq 0\) when \(x \leq -2\) or \(x \geq 3\).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the intervals where \(y > 0\) or \(y < 0\), or incorrectly interpreting the direction of the inequality. However, given the graph and the straightforward nature of the question, it seems that most students should be able to identify that \(y \geq 0\) outside the roots, i.e., \(x \leq -2\) or \(x \geq 3\).

## 4: Evaluating the Options
- Option A: \(\{x \leq -2\} \cup \{x \geq 3\}\) suggests \(y \geq 0\) when \(x\) is less than or equal to \(-2\) or greater than or equal to \(3\), which matches the regions on the graph where \(y\) is non-negative.
- Option B: \(\{-2 \leq x \leq 3\}\) suggests \(y \geq 0\) between \(-2\) and \(3\), which is incorrect because \(y < 0\) between the roots.
- Option C: \(\{-2 \geq x \geq 3\}\) is nonsensical as written because it implies \(x\) is simultaneously less than or equal to \(-2\) and greater than or equal to \(3\), which cannot be true.
- Option D: \(\{x \geq -2\} \cup \{x \leq 3\}\) suggests \(y \geq 0\) when \(x\) is greater than or equal to \(-2\) or less than or equal to \(3\), which includes the interval where \(y < 0\).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with understanding the graph and the inequality. They might choose B or D due to confusion about where \(y \geq 0\). A=20%, B=40%, C=10%, D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students here should have a better grasp of quadratic equations and graphs but might still make careless mistakes. A=60%, B=20%, C=5%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to accurately interpret the graph and solve the inequality. A=80%, B=10%, C=2%, D=8%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students should easily and accurately solve the problem. A=90%, B=5%, C=1%, D=4%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=1% D=4%
