To approach this question, let's first understand the 2-step function machine described:

1. The input \(x\) is first multiplied by 5, giving \(5x\).
2. Then, this result is subtracted from 8, which translates to \(8 - 5x\).

Thus, the correct output of the function machine is \(8 - 5x\).

Now, let's examine the statements made by Tom and Katie:

- Tom says the output is \(5x - 8\).
- Katie says the output is \(8 - 5x\).

From the correct calculation, Katie is correct, and Tom is incorrect.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The misconception here often involves misunderstanding the order of operations or the way functions are composed. Students might incorrectly apply the operations in reverse or misinterpret the subtraction step.

## 2: Evaluating Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with even basic algebraic manipulations and understanding of function compositions. They might not fully grasp the concept of input-output processes in functions. Given the simplicity of the question but the potential for confusion, we might expect a significant portion to choose incorrectly, but let's assume some will pick up on the correct sequence by chance or basic understanding.

## 3: Predicting Student Choices
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (Tom, due to incorrect but possibly familiar form), B=20% (Katie, correctly), C=10% (Both, indicating confusion), D=40% (Neither, indicating a lack of understanding).
- **Basic**: A=20% (Tom), B=60% (Katie, as they start to understand function composition), C=5% (Both), D=15% (Neither).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (Tom), B=80% (Katie), C=5% (Both), D=10% (Neither).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (Tom), B=90% (Katie), C=5% (Both), D=5% (Neither).

## 4: Correcting Predictions
Given the clear and straightforward nature of the question once understood, and assuming most students can follow the simple function machine steps:

- **Below Basic**: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
- **Basic**: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

The best answer is below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
