To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the properties of quadrilaterals involved.

## Step 1: Understanding the Properties
A kite is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal in length. One of the key properties of a kite is that it has diagonals that are perpendicular, and one of the diagonals bisects the other. A rhombus is a special type of quadrilateral where all four sides are of equal length. A key property of a rhombus is that its diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

## 2: Analyzing the Statements
Tom says a kite has bisecting diagonals. This is partially correct in that one diagonal of a kite bisects the other, but the question's phrasing might imply both diagonals bisect each other, which is a characteristic of rhombi and certain other quadrilaterals, not all kites. Katie says a rhombus has bisecting diagonals, which is correct as both diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other.

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
Students might have misconceptions about the properties of kites and rhombi. A common misconception could be confusing the properties of these shapes or not fully understanding what "bisecting diagonals" means. However, both statements can be evaluated based on basic geometric principles.

## 4: Evaluating the Question's Difficulty
The question seems straightforward, testing knowledge of specific properties of quadrilaterals. The potential difficulty lies in whether students accurately recall that kites have one diagonal that bisects the other (not necessarily both bisecting each other) and that rhombi definitely have bisecting diagonals.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students might not have a strong grasp of quadrilateral properties. They might incorrectly attribute properties or get confused: A=30% (some know kites have special diagonals), B=20% (some know rhombus properties), C=20% (less likely to combine correctly), D=30% (uncertainty or incorrect understanding).
- **Basic**: Students have a basic understanding but might still get confused: A=40% (recognize kite property), B=30% (recognize rhombus property), C=20% (combine correctly), D=10% (less likely to deny both).
- **Proficient**: These students should have a solid grasp: A=10% (unlikely to think only Tom is correct), B=10% (unlikely to think only Katie), C=80% (both are correct), D=0% (should understand both statements).
- **Advanced**: Students will easily recognize both properties: A=5% (very unlikely), B=5% (very unlikely), C=90% (both are indeed correct), D=0% (definitely not).

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=10% B=10% C=80% D=0%
- **advanced**: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=80% D=0%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
