To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the misconceptions it might trigger.

The question revolves around identifying linear sequences. A linear sequence, or arithmetic sequence, is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between any two successive members is constant. 

## Step 1: Analyzing Tom's Sequence
Tom's sequence is \( 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, \ldots \). To determine if it's linear, we check the differences between successive terms: \(2 - 1 = 1\), \(4 - 2 = 2\), \(7 - 4 = 3\), \(11 - 7 = 4\). Since the differences are not constant, Tom's sequence is not linear.

## 2: Analyzing Katie's Sequence
Katie's sequence is \( 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2, \ldots \). Checking the differences: \(1.4 - 1.2 = 0.2\), \(1.6 - 1.4 = 0.2\), \(1.8 - 1.6 = 0.2\), \(2 - 1.8 = 0.2\). The differences are constant, so Katie's sequence is linear.

## 3: Evaluating the Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to mistake a sequence that is not linear for one that is, especially if the sequence appears to increase or decrease regularly but not at a constant rate. Conversely, some students might recognize a linear sequence but fail to identify a non-linear one correctly.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding what a linear sequence is or how to calculate differences between terms. They might incorrectly identify sequences or not recognize the pattern. So, they could be more likely to choose \(A\) (Only Tom) or \(D\) (Neither is correct) due to confusion. \(A=30\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=40\%\)
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding of sequences but might still make errors in identifying linear sequences, especially if the numbers are not straightforward. They might correctly identify Katie's sequence but struggle with Tom's. Thus, \(A=25\%\), \(B=35\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=20\%\)
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the definition of a linear sequence and can apply it. They should correctly identify Katie's sequence as linear and Tom's as not. So, \(A=10\%\), \(B=50\%\), \(C=30\%\), \(D=10\%\)
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the concept but can also reason about it accurately. They should easily identify Katie's sequence as linear and Tom's as not, with a high likelihood of choosing \(B\). Hence, \(A=5\%\), \(B=60\%\), \(C=30\%\), \(D=5\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=25% B=35% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=50% C=30% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=60% C=30% D=5%
