## Step 1: Understand the question
The question provides a sequence of numbers: 1, 2, 4, 8, and asks which of the given options (A, B, C, D) these numbers are the only factors of.

## 2: Identify the factors for each option
- Option A: Factors of 1 are just 1.
- Option B: Factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8.
- Option C: Factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.
- Option D: Factors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.

## 3: Determine the correct answer
The sequence given (1, 2, 4, 8) matches exactly with the factors of 8, which are 1, 2, 4, and 8. This means the correct answer is B) 8, as these are the only factors listed.

## 4: Analyze potential misconceptions and student errors
Students might struggle if they misunderstand what "factors" mean or if they incorrectly list factors for the numbers given in the options. However, this question seems straightforward because the numbers provided directly correspond to the factors of one of the options without requiring additional calculations that could lead to errors.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand what factors are or may struggle to identify them correctly. They might randomly select an option or choose one that seems "big" enough to have the listed factors. A=20% (completely off, thinking it's a single factor), B=40% (recognizing the sequence but possibly not understanding it's the only set), C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding of factors but might make simple mistakes. They should recognize the sequence fits option B well but might be tempted by C or D due to a lack of confidence in their factor identification. A=5%, B=70%, C=15%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with factors and should easily identify that 1, 2, 4, 8 are only factors of 8. A=1%, B=90%, C=5%, D=4%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and should not make errors. A=0%, B=95%, C=3%, D=2%.

## 6: Convert predictions into the required format
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
- basic: A=5% B=70% C=15% D=10%
- proficient: A=1% B=90% C=5% D=4%
- advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=70% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=1% B=90% C=5% D=4%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
