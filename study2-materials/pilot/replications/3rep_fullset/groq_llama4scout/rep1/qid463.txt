To approach this question, let's consider what makes two lines parallel: they must have the same slope (gradient) but different y-intercepts.

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's Statement
Tom claims that \( y=2x+5 \) and \( y=2x-7 \) are parallel. For two lines to be parallel, they must have the same gradient but different y-intercepts. Both lines have a gradient of 2, but they have different y-intercepts (+5 and -7, respectively). Therefore, Tom is correct.

## 2: Analyze Katie's Statement
Katie claims that \( y=2x+5 \) and \( y=3x+5 \) are parallel. These lines have different gradients (2 and 3, respectively) but the same y-intercept (+5). For lines to be parallel, they need to have the same gradient but different y-intercepts. Since these lines have the same y-intercept and different gradients, Katie is incorrect.

## 3: Consider Student Understanding
- Students at the **below_basic** level might struggle to understand the concept of parallel lines and may not be able to identify gradients and y-intercepts accurately. They might choose randomly or based on a very superficial understanding.
- Students at the **basic** level should have a grasp of the concept that parallel lines have the same gradient but different y-intercepts. However, they might make mistakes in applying this rule, especially if they confuse the conditions.
- Students at the **proficient** level should easily understand and apply the conditions for parallel lines. They should be able to identify Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect based on the gradients and y-intercepts.
- Students at the **advanced** level not only understand the conditions for parallel lines but can also apply them quickly and accurately. They should have no trouble identifying the correct answer.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
Given the clarity of the question and the straightforward application of the concept:
- **Below_basic**: These students might not fully grasp the concept. They could mistakenly think Katie is right because the lines have the same y-intercept, or they might not understand the gradient concept well. A=30%, B=20%, C=10%, D=40%
- **Basic**: At this level, students start to understand the basics. They might still make errors but are more likely to get it right. A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%
- **Proficient**: These students should mostly understand that Tom is correct and Katie is not. A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%
- **Advanced**: Students here should have a strong grasp of the concept. A=90%, B=0%, C=0%, D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
