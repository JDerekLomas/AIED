## Step 1: Understand the question
The question presents a visual representation of a bar divided into 4 equal sections, with the leftmost section colored green and further divided into 2 equal sections. The task is to determine which calculation gives the fraction that replaces the question mark, which represents the width of one of the smaller green sections.

## 2: Identify the correct calculation
The entire bar is divided into 4 equal sections, so it represents a whole or 1. The colored green part represents \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the bar. This green part is further divided into 2 equal sections, so each smaller section represents \( \frac{1}{2} \) of \( \frac{1}{4} \), or \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} \).

## 3: Analyze option A
Option A is \( \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{1}{2} \). This does not match our calculation because the fraction of the bar that is green is \( \frac{1}{4} \), not \( \frac{2}{5} \).

## 4: Analyze option B
Option B is \( \frac{1}{4} \div \frac{1}{2} \). This can be rewritten as \( \frac{1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{1}{2} \), which does not match the fraction we are looking for.

## 5: Analyze option C
Option C is \( \frac{2}{5} \div 2 \). This implies \( \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{5} \), which again does not match because the green part is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the whole.

## 6: Analyze option D
Option D is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} \). This directly matches our identification of the fraction for one of the smaller green sections.

## 7: Consider student understanding at different levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding fractions and the operations involved. They might incorrectly choose options based on superficial understanding or misinterpretation of the visual. Option D seems correct but let's consider the likelihood of errors.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to misunderstanding the division and multiplication of fractions or the visual representation.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of fractions and operations. They should easily identify the correct option.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them to complex problems. They should have no issue with this question.

## 8: Predict student responses
Given the clear visual and straightforward calculation:
- **Below_basic**: A=20% (misinterprets the fraction of the green part), B=15% (confuses division and multiplication), C=15% (misinterprets both fractions), D=50% (correctly interprets the visual and calculation).
- **Basic**: A=10% (less likely to misinterpret), B=10%, C=10%, D=70%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.
- **Advanced**: A=0% (or very close to), B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

## 9: Format the response
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=15% D=50%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
