## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a scenario where John rotates a hexagon \( \mathrm{ABCDEF} \) by \( 90^{\degree} \) clockwise from the centre \( (5,4) \) and asks for the error he has made. The original and rotated hexagons are provided on a coordinate grid.

## 2: Identifying Key Concepts
To solve this, students need to understand rotation in coordinate geometry, specifically how to rotate a figure \( 90^{\degree} \) clockwise or anticlockwise around a given centre. A \( 90^{\degree} \) clockwise rotation about the origin is given by \( (x, y) \rightarrow (y, -x) \), but since the rotation is about \( (5,4) \) and not the origin, the transformation involves translating the system to align the rotation point with the origin, applying the rotation, and then translating back.

## 3: Analyzing Option A
Option A suggests John has translated by the vector \( \left(\begin{array}{l}5 \\ 4\end{array}\right) \). This would mean he simply moved the hexagon to a new position without rotating it, which doesn't align with a rotation error but a translation error.

## 4: Analyzing Option B
Option B suggests a \( 90^{\degree} \) anticlockwise rotation instead of clockwise. This is a plausible mistake as it involves confusion between clockwise and anticlockwise rotations.

## 5: Analyzing Option C
Option C suggests John used the wrong centre. This could be a common error if students misinterpret the centre of rotation or miscalculate the new positions based on an incorrect centre.

## 6: Analyzing Option D
Option D states that John hasn't made an error, which would mean the rotation was performed correctly.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding rotations and translations. They might confuse the type of transformation or the centre of rotation. Option A (translation error) and Option B (wrong direction of rotation) could be tempting as they represent common misconceptions. Option C (wrong centre) might also be considered if students recognize the centre given but are unsure about its application. Option D (no error) seems unlikely for this group. Predicted percentages: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%.
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a grasp of basic transformations but might still struggle with applying them correctly, especially with the centre of rotation not being the origin. They might be more likely to recognize a rotation error but could be split between A, B, and C. Predicted percentages: A=20% B=30% C=25% D=25%.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand transformations well and are likely to identify the correct error. They might be more inclined to recognize if the rotation direction or centre is incorrect. Option D might start to gain more recognition as these students are more likely to perform or conceptualize the transformation correctly. Predicted percentages: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are expected to have a strong grasp of transformation geometry. They are likely to quickly identify any errors in rotation, including direction and centre. Option D is likely to be the most recognized as correct if the transformation was indeed done correctly, or they accurately identify the mistake. Predicted percentages: A=5% B=10% C=15% D=70%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=25% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
advanced: A=5% B=10% C=15% D=70%
