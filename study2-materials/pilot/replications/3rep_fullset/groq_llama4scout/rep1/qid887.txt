To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question revolves around the properties of exponents and powers, specifically checking if students can evaluate expressions like \(2^6\), \(4^3\), and \(8^2\) correctly and compare them.

## Step 1: Understand the mathematical concepts involved
\(2^6 = 64\), \(4^3 = (2^2)^3 = 2^6 = 64\), and \(8^2 = (2^3)^2 = 2^6 = 64\). Therefore, both Tom and Katie are correct because \(2^6 = 4^3 = 8^2 = 64\).

## 2: Identify potential misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not understanding the properties of exponents, such as \((a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}\), or incorrectly calculating powers.

## 3: Analyze the question for ease or difficulty
This question might seem straightforward to students who are confident in their understanding of exponent rules. However, students who are not fluent in applying these rules or who make careless mistakes in calculations might find it challenging.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with calculating powers and applying exponent rules. They might incorrectly calculate \(2^6\), \(4^3\), or \(8^2\), leading to incorrect comparisons. Expect a high percentage of errors, with many possibly choosing D) Neither is correct due to calculation mistakes.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple calculation errors or not fully apply exponent properties correctly. They might be more likely to recognize that both could be right or wrong but could be tricked into choosing only one or neither due to miscalculations.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to calculate correctly and understand the properties of exponents. They should recognize that both Tom and Katie are correct, making C) Both Tom and Katie the correct choice.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to not only calculate correctly but also to understand the underlying mathematical principles deeply. They would easily see that both statements are correct and choose C) Both Tom and Katie.

## 5: Estimate percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the calculations involved and assuming most students have a basic understanding of exponents:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might incorrectly think only Tom is right), B=15% (think only Katie), C=30% (correct but through luck or simple recognition), D=35% (many errors in calculation or understanding).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=10%, C=70% (most get it right with some confidence), D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=85% (strong understanding), D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=95% (very confident in their understanding), D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
