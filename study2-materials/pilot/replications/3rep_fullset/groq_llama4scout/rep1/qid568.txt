To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( \frac{1}{7} \) of \( 56= \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or ease of calculation.

The question requires finding one-seventh of 56, which is a straightforward calculation: \( \frac{1}{7} \times 56 = 8 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Calculation
The calculation \( \frac{1}{7} \) of \( 56 \) is essentially dividing 56 by 7, which equals 8. This is a basic division fact that many students learn early on.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions or Errors
A common misconception might involve confusing the operation or misinterpreting the fraction. However, given that \( \frac{1}{7} \) of a number is equivalent to dividing that number by 7, and 56 is a multiple of 7 (7 * 8 = 56), this question is quite direct.

## 3: Analyzing Option Attractiveness
- Option A: \( 7 \) might be chosen by students who mistakenly think \( \frac{1}{7} \) of 56 is 7, possibly confusing it with \( \frac{1}{8} \) of 56 or another incorrect operation.
- Option B: \( 8 \) is the correct answer, as \( \frac{1}{7} \times 56 = 8 \).
- Option C: \( 9 \) seems unrelated to simple calculations involving 56 and \( \frac{1}{7} \), likely to be chosen by those making a significant error.
- Option D: \( 49 \) could be chosen by students who incorrectly calculate \( \frac{1}{7} \) of 56 as \( 56 - 7 \) or another incorrect method.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic division or fraction concepts. They might choose A, C, or D due to confusion or incorrect calculations. Given the simplicity of the numbers, B might still be within reach for some, but errors are likely. Prediction: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%.
- **basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic fractions and division. They are likely to get it right but might make careless mistakes. Prediction: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%.
- **proficient**: These students understand fractions and division well and are less likely to make mistakes on straightforward calculations like this. Prediction: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%.
- **advanced**: Advanced students are very confident in their math abilities and are unlikely to make errors on simple calculations. Prediction: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
