## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a parallelogram with one angle given as 120 degrees and asks for the size of angle \( q \), which is opposite to the 120-degree angle in the bottom right corner of the parallelogram.

## 2: Properties of a Parallelogram
In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. This property is crucial for solving the question.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 60^{\circ} \)
- Option B: \( 80^{\circ} \)
- Option C: \( 120^{\circ} \)
- Option D: Not enough information

## 4: Applying Knowledge to the Question
Given that opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal, and one angle is 120 degrees, angle \( q \) must also be 120 degrees because it is opposite to the 120-degree angle.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic properties of shapes or might not understand the concept of opposite angles in a parallelogram. They might choose an option that seems plausible but incorrect, such as \( 60^{\circ} \) (thinking of a different property or making a simple mistake), or they might not recognize the parallelogram's properties and choose \( 80^{\circ} \) or incorrectly think there's not enough information. So, below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of geometry. They should recognize that opposite angles are equal but might still make simple mistakes or not fully apply their knowledge. Thus, they are likely to choose C, but there's a chance for error: basic: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
- **Proficient:** Students at this level have a solid understanding of geometric properties, including those of parallelograms. They should accurately identify angle \( q \) as 120 degrees with high confidence. So, proficient: A=5% B=0% C=95% D=0%
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the properties but can also apply them in complex situations. They will definitely choose C: advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the properties of a parallelogram, most students, especially those who are proficient or advanced, will get it right.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=95% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
