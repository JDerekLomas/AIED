## Step 1: Understand the task
The task requires predicting the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for completing the square in the given quadratic expression \(2g^{2} - 6g - 5 \equiv 2(g \bigstar)^{2} \triangle\).

## 2: Identify the correct process for completing the square
To complete the square for \(2g^{2} - 6g - 5\), first factor out the coefficient of \(g^{2}\), which is 2: \(2(g^{2} - 3g) - 5\). Then, to complete the square for \(g^{2} - 3g\), add and subtract \((\frac{-3}{2})^{2} = \frac{9}{4}\) inside the parenthesis: \(2(g^{2} - 3g + \frac{9}{4}) - 5 - 2(\frac{9}{4})\). This simplifies to \(2(g - \frac{3}{2})^{2} - 5 - \frac{9}{2}\).

## 3: Simplify the expression further
Simplifying \(2(g - \frac{3}{2})^{2} - 5 - \frac{9}{2}\) gives \(2(g - \frac{3}{2})^{2} - \frac{10}{2} - \frac{9}{2}\), which is \(2(g - \frac{3}{2})^{2} - \frac{19}{2}\).

## 4: Compare with the given expression
The given expression is \(2(g \bigstar)^{2} \triangle\). From our manipulation, \(\bigstar = -\frac{3}{2}\) or \(-1.5\), and \(\triangle = -\frac{19}{2}\).

## 5: Analyze option choices
- A: \(\bigstar = -6\), incorrect.
- B: \(\bigstar = -3\), incorrect.
- C: \(\bigstar = -1.5\), correct.
- D: \(\bigstar = -\sqrt{6}\), incorrect.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level may struggle with the concept of completing the square and could choose any option based on misunderstanding or guesswork. However, they might be inclined towards simpler values, so A and B could be tempting. \(A = 30\%\), \(B = 25\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(D = 25\%\).
- **Basic**: Basic level students have a grasp of quadratic equations but might make procedural errors. They are more likely to recognize the need to halve the coefficient of \(g\) but could struggle with the division by 2 and negative signs. \(A = 15\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 55\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand completing the square well and are less likely to make errors in identifying \(\bigstar\). \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 80\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are very familiar with completing the square and are unlikely to make mistakes. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 0\%\), \(C = 95\%\), \(D = 5\%\).

## 7: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=55% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
