To approach this question, let's consider what makes a line perpendicular to another. For a line to be perpendicular to \(y = 5\), it must be a vertical line because \(y = 5\) is a horizontal line. A vertical line has an equation of the form \(x = a\), where \(a\) is a constant.

## Step 1: Understanding Perpendicular Lines
A line perpendicular to a horizontal line (\(y = 5\)) is a vertical line. The equation of a vertical line is \(x = c\), where \(c\) is any real number.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(x = -27\). This is a vertical line.
- Option B: \(y = -5\). This is a horizontal line.
- Option C: \(y = \frac{1}{5}\). This is a horizontal line.
- Option D: \(y = -\frac{1}{5}\). This is a horizontal line.

## 3: Identifying the Correct Option
The only line that is perpendicular to \(y = 5\) is a vertical line. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: \(x = -27\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle to understand the concept of perpendicular lines or may not recognize the form of a vertical line's equation. They might choose based on superficial similarities or incorrect understanding. Expect a high chance of error.
  - A: 40% (some might recognize the form but not understand perpendicularity)
  - B: 25% (horizontal line, might seem related)
  - C: 15% (another horizontal line)
  - D: 20% (yet another horizontal line)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still confuse the concepts. They are more likely to recognize horizontal and vertical lines but might not apply the perpendicular concept accurately.
  - A: 60%
  - B: 20%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 15%

- **Proficient:** Students at this level understand the concepts well and can apply them. They should easily identify the vertical line as the correct answer.
  - A: 90%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 2%
  - D: 3%

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the concepts but can also reason abstractly. They will have no trouble identifying the correct answer.
  - A: 98%
  - B: 1%
  - C: 0.5%
  - D: 0.5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
