## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks students to identify a factor of the expression \(6n^{2} - 9\) from given options.

## 2: Factor out the expression
To solve this, let's first try to factor the given expression: \(6n^{2} - 9\). We can factor out a 3: \(6n^{2} - 9 = 3(2n^{2} - 3)\).

## 3: Analyze the options
Now, let's analyze the options given:
- A: \(6\)
- B: \(9\)
- C: \(n\)
- D: \(3\)

## 4: Check each option
- Option A: \(6\) is not a factor of \(6n^{2} - 9\) because we cannot divide \(6n^{2} - 9\) by 6 and get a whole number expression in terms of \(n\).
- Option B: \(9\) is not a factor because \(6n^{2} - 9 = 3(2n^{2} - 3)\), and there's no 9 that can be factored out from \(2n^{2} - 3\).
- Option C: \(n\) is not a factor because \(n\) is not a factor of the constant term \(-9\), and when you factor out \(n\), you're left with \(n(6n - \frac{9}{n})\), which does not match \(6n^{2} - 9\).
- Option D: \(3\) is a factor as shown in step 2: \(3(2n^{2} - 3)\).

## 5: Consider student misconceptions and abilities
- Students at the below_basic level might struggle to factor or understand what a factor is. They might mistakenly choose A or B because they see large numbers and think they could be factors, or they might not fully understand the concept of factoring expressions.
- Basic level students might recognize \(3\) as a common factor but could be tricked into thinking \(6\), \(9\), or \(n\) could be factors without properly checking.
- Proficient students should easily identify \(3\) as a factor and rule out the others.
- Advanced students will not only identify \(3\) as a factor but also understand why the other options are incorrect.

## 6: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option
- **Below Basic**: 
  - A: 20% (thinking 6 could be a factor because it's a big number in the expression)
  - B: 15% (similar reasoning for 9)
  - C: 10% (thinking n could be a factor because it's in the expression)
  - D: 45% (some basic understanding that 3 is a factor)

- **Basic**:
  - A: 10%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 15% (common misconception)
  - D: 70%

- **Proficient**:
  - A: 5%
  - B: 2%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 88%

- **Advanced**:
  - A: 2%
  - B: 1%
  - C: 2%
  - D: 95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=45%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=15% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=5% D=88%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=2% D=95%
