To approach this question, let's first calculate the area of the given rectangle and then the areas of the triangles provided in the options to identify which ones have the same area as the rectangle.

The area of the rectangle = base × height = 7 × 3 = 21 square units.

## Step 1: Calculate the area of the triangle in option A
The area of a triangle = 0.5 × base × perpendicular height. For option A, the base = 6 and the perpendicular height = 7. So, the area = 0.5 × 6 × 7 = 21 square units.

## 2: Calculate the area of the triangle in option B
For option B, the base = 5 and the height = 6. So, the area = 0.5 × 5 × 6 = 15 square units.

## 3: Calculate the area of the triangle in option C
For option C, the base = 6 and the perpendicular height = 8. So, the area = 0.5 × 6 × 8 = 24 square units.

## 4: Analyze the results
- Option A has an area of 21 square units, which matches the rectangle's area.
- Option B has an area of 15 square units, which does not match.
- Option C has an area of 24 square units, which does not match.

## 5: Predicting student responses
Given that the question tests the concept of area and the formula for the area of a triangle, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who might choose each option.

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the formula for the area of a triangle or might not understand the concept of perpendicular height. They might be more likely to choose an option based on superficial similarities or incorrect calculations.
  - A: 20% (some might get it right by chance or simple calculation)
  - B: 30% (might be attracted to similar numbers or incorrect calculation)
  - C: 30% (similar reasoning)
  - D: 20% (unlikely, as it requires understanding that not all could be equal)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might make simple calculation errors or not fully understand the implications of the formulas.
  - A: 50% (as they can calculate the area and see it matches)
  - B: 20% (calculation error or misunderstanding)
  - C: 20% (similar)
  - D: 10% (less likely, as they have some understanding)

- **Proficient**: Students who are proficient should easily calculate and compare areas.
  - A: 80% (correct calculation and understanding)
  - B: 5% (minor calculation error or lapse in attention)
  - C: 5% (similar)
  - D: 10% (unlikely, but some might doubt their calculations)

- **Advanced**: These students should have a deep understanding and be able to quickly assess the areas.
  - A: 90% (easy and straightforward calculation)
  - B: 0% (unlikely to make a basic error)
  - C: 0% (similar)
  - D: 10% (unlikely, but could consider the possibility of error in other options)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
