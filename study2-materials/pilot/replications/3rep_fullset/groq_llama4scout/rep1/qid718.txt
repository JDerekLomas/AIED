To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential pitfalls for students at different ability levels.

The question revolves around the concept of factors in algebra, specifically focusing on the expression \(12y\). 

- A factor of a term is a value that can be multiplied by another value to produce that term. 
- For \(12y\), the factors include \(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, y, 2y, 3y, 4y, 6y,\) and \(12y\), among others.

Tom says \(y\) is a factor of \(12y\), which is true because \(12y = y \times 12\). 

Katie says \(3\) is a factor of \(12y\), which is also true because \(12y = 3 \times 4y\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not recognizing \(y\) or numerical values as factors if they are not explicitly listed or if the student misunderstands the definition of a factor in algebraic terms.

## 2: Analyzing Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic concepts and the definition of factors. They might not understand that both \(y\) and \(3\) can be factors of \(12y\), potentially leading to confusion. However, the simplicity of the statements might help them see that both Tom and Katie are correct, but there's a chance they could struggle with the abstract nature of \(y\) as a factor.
  
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a foundational understanding of factors but might still make errors due to lack of practice with algebraic expressions. They should recognize \(3\) as a factor but might be less confident about \(y\). Still, they are likely to agree with both.

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of factors and algebraic expressions. They should easily recognize both \(y\) and \(3\) as factors of \(12y\), making option C the most likely choice.

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concept but can also apply it with ease. They will certainly recognize both \(y\) and \(3\) as factors.

## 3: Predicting Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the clear correctness of both statements:
- **Below Basic**: A=10% (might not see \(y\) as a factor), B=10% (might not see \(3\) as a factor), C=60% (recognize both), D=20% (see neither as correct).
- **Basic**: A=5% (unlikely to dismiss \(y\)), B=5% (unlikely to dismiss \(3\)), C=85% (most see both as correct), D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=2% (very unlikely to dismiss \(y\)), B=2% (very unlikely to dismiss \(3\)), C=95% (almost all see both as correct), D=1%.
- **Advanced**: A=1% (extremely unlikely to dismiss \(y\)), B=1% (extremely unlikely to dismiss \(3\)), C=98% (nearly all agree with both), D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=98% D=0%
