## Step 1: Analyzing the Question
The question presents a rectangle with labeled sides and asks to identify the incorrect statement among the given options regarding its area, perimeter, and side lengths.

## 2: Understanding the Misconceptions and Difficulty Levels
- The area of a rectangle is given by length times width, so \( \text{Area} = x \times (2x + 4) = 2x^2 + 4x \).
- The perimeter of a rectangle is given by \( 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \), so \( \text{Perimeter} = 2(x + 2x + 4) = 2(3x + 4) = 6x + 8 \).
- For the sides to be equal (which would make the statement \( 2x + 4 = 3x - 4 \) potentially true), solving this equation yields \( x = 8 \).

## 3: Evaluating Option A
Option A suggests \( \text{Area} = 3x^2 - 4 \). The correct area calculation is \( x(2x + 4) = 2x^2 + 4x \), making option A incorrect based on the given expressions for the sides.

## 4: Evaluating Option B
Option B suggests \( \text{Perimeter} = 6x + 8 \), which matches our calculation for the perimeter: \( 2(x + (2x + 4)) = 2(3x + 4) = 6x + 8 \). So, option B seems correct.

## 5: Evaluating Option C
Option C, \( 2x + 4 = 3x - 4 \), simplifies to \( x = 8 \), which could potentially be a correct relationship between the sides if they are equal, but given the context, it seems like a condition rather than an inherent property of the rectangle's dimensions.

## 6: Evaluating Option D
Option D, \( x = 8 \), if true, would make the top side \( 2(8) + 4 = 20 \) and the bottom side \( 3(8) - 4 = 20 \), confirming that \( x = 8 \) could make the sides equal.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with algebraic expressions and formulas. They might incorrectly identify the area or perimeter formulas or misunderstand the equality of sides. Option A seems clearly incorrect based on standard formulas, but these students might not recognize this. Option C and D might seem plausible if they misunderstand the conditions for equality. **A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%**
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebra and formulas. They might still make errors in calculating or understanding the implications of the given equations. **A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%**
- **Proficient**: These students are familiar with algebraic manipulation and geometric formulas. They should easily identify option A as incorrect and understand the conditions under which the other statements are true or false. **A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%**
- **Advanced**: Students at this level can quickly evaluate the expressions and understand the conditions. They are less likely to make errors in basic calculations. **A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
