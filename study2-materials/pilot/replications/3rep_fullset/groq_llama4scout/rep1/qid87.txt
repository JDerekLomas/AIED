## Step 1: Understand the question
The question requires students to solve the equation \(x^{2}+4x-1=-6\) using a graph of \(y = x^{2}+4x-1\). The equation can be rewritten as \(x^{2}+4x+5=0\). This involves finding the roots of the quadratic equation graphically.

## 2: Identify the graphical method
To solve \(x^{2}+4x+5=0\) graphically, students need to find where the graph of \(y = x^{2}+4x-1\) intersects the line \(y = -6\), because at the points of intersection, \(x^{2}+4x-1 = -6\).

## 3: Consider student understanding and common misconceptions
- Students below basic might struggle with understanding the graphical representation and solving quadratic equations.
- Students at basic level might understand the concept but struggle with applying it accurately, especially if the graph isn't precisely drawn or if they misinterpret the intersections.
- Proficient students should be able to solve this with ease, understanding both the algebraic and graphical methods.
- Advanced students would likely have a deep understanding and could solve it quickly, possibly even algebraically.

## 4: Analyze the given options
- Option A: \(x=4.25, x=-0.25\)
- Option B: No real solutions
- Option C: \(x=-4.25, x=0.25\)
- Option D: \(x=-1\)

## 5: Solve the quadratic equation for reference
The equation \(x^{2}+4x+5=0\) can be solved using the quadratic formula: \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a=1\), \(b=4\), and \(c=5\).
\[x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^{2}-4*1*5}}{2*1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16-20}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2}\]
Since \(\sqrt{-4}\) involves the imaginary unit \(i\), there are no real solutions.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: These students might not fully understand how to use the graph or the quadratic formula. They might guess or not attempt the question. Given the nature of the question, they might lean towards incorrect solutions or "no real solutions" without proper calculation: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level might understand the concepts but could make errors in application. They might identify that the solutions are not real or make calculation mistakes: A=15% B=50% C=25% D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students should recognize the equation has no real solutions by either graphical inspection or algebraic manipulation: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students would quickly identify the nature of the solutions: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%.

## 7: Format the predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
- basic: A=15% B=50% C=25% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=50% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
