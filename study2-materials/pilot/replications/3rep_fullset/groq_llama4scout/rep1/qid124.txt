To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with it.

The question is: \((-8) - (-5) = \square\)

This question tests the understanding of subtracting negative numbers. A common misconception is that two negatives make a positive, which can lead to incorrect calculations.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Calculation
The correct calculation for \((-8) - (-5)\) is \(-8 + 5 = -3\). This is because subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding a positive number.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common error might be to think that \(-(-5)\) equals \(-5\) (ignoring the rule that two negatives make a positive), leading to \(-8 - 5 = -13\), or mistakenly adding the numbers without considering the signs properly.

## 3: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A: \(-13\). This would be a result of \(-8 - 5\), ignoring the subtraction of a negative.
- Option B: \(13\). This seems unlikely as it involves a misunderstanding of both operations.
- Option C: \(3\). This could result from an incorrect application of rules, such as \(-8 + 8 = 0\) and then adding \(5\), but that's not directly relevant here.
- Option D: \(-3\). This is the correct answer.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of negative numbers and operations with them. They might choose A (\(-13\)) because they simply subtract without considering the double negative, or they might not understand the concept at all and pick randomly. Option D (\(-3\)) might be chosen by those who have some intuition about negative numbers but not a solid grasp. 
  - A: 40% (misapplication of subtraction), B: 10% (random or misunderstanding), C: 10% (random), D: 40% (partial understanding).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with the nuances. They are likely to choose D (\(-3\)) as they understand basic operations, but some might still opt for A (\(-13\)) due to not fully grasping the subtraction of a negative.
  - A: 20%, B: 5%, C: 5%, D: 70%.
- **Proficient**: These students have a good grasp of the concepts and are less likely to make basic errors. They should mostly choose D (\(-3\)).
  - A: 5%, B: 2%, C: 3%, D: 90%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident in their mathematical abilities and should almost universally choose the correct answer.
  - A: 1%, B: 1%, C: 1%, D: 97%.

## 5: Translating Predictions into Required Format
Given the nature of the task and based on intuitive predictions:
- **below_basic**: A=40% B=10% C=10% D=40%
- **basic**: A=20% B=5% C=5% D=70%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=2% C=3% D=90%
- **advanced**: A=1% B=1% C=1% D=97%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=5% C=5% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=3% D=90%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=1% D=97%
