To approach this question, let's first analyze the equation \(x^{2} - 10x - 25 = 0\) and the conditions given by the circles in the Venn diagram.

## Step 1: Solve the Quadratic Equation
The equation given is \(x^{2} - 10x - 25 = 0\). This can be solved using the quadratic formula, \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -10\), and \(c = -25\).

## 2: Apply the Quadratic Formula
Substitute \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the quadratic formula:
\[x = \frac{-(-10) \pm \sqrt{(-10)^{2} - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-25)}}{2 \cdot 1}\]
\[x = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{100 + 100}}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{200}}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{10 \pm 10\sqrt{2}}{2}\]
\[x = 5 \pm 5\sqrt{2}\]

## 3: Analyze the Solutions
The solutions to the equation are \(x = 5 + 5\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 5 - 5\sqrt{2}\). Neither of these solutions is equal to 0.

## 4: Determine if the Equation Factorises
The equation \(x^{2} - 10x - 25 = 0\) can be examined to see if it factorises easily. It does not factorise neatly into integer roots, but let's check if it can be considered to factorise in a way that's useful: \(x^{2} - 10x - 25 = (x - 5 - 5\sqrt{2})(x - 5 + 5\sqrt{2}) = 0\), which shows it can be expressed as a product of two binomials, thus it does factorise, but not into linear factors with integer coefficients.

## 5: Evaluate the Options
- **Factorises:** The equation does factorise, but not in a simple integer form.
- **Has one solution equal to 0:** Neither solution is 0.

## 6: Consider Student Errors
- Students might struggle with recognising that the equation does factorise (even if not neatly) and that neither root is 0.
- A common misconception could be thinking the equation doesn't factorise or incorrectly identifying the roots.

## 7: Predict Student Responses
Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:
- **Below Basic:** Might struggle to solve the equation or understand the conditions. They might incorrectly place it outside the circles (D) if they can't solve it or see it doesn't fit the 'one solution equals 0' condition. A=20% (some might think it simple factorisation), B=10% (unlikely to see overlap), C=10% (since solutions aren't 0), D=60%.
- **Basic:** Should be able to attempt solving and see it doesn't have a solution of 0. They might still struggle with factorisation. A=30% (recognise factorisation), B=20% (some see both conditions), C=5% (since solutions aren't 0), D=45%.
- **Proficient:** Should easily see it factorises and solutions aren't 0. A=60% (clearly factorises), B=20% (overlap for both conditions), C=5% (solutions not 0), D=15%.
- **Advanced:** Will quickly solve and categorise. A=80% (clear factorisation), B=10% (recognise both), C=0% (solutions not 0), D=10%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=5% D=45%
proficient: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=80% B=10% C=0% D=10%
