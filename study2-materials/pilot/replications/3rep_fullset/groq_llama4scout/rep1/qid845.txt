To approach this question, let's analyze the angles given and the statements made by Tom and Katie.

The triangle has angles: \( 90\degree, 50\degree, 40\degree \).

- A right-angled triangle has one angle that is \( 90\degree \).
- An isosceles triangle has at least two angles that are equal.

## Step 1: Evaluate Tom's statement
Tom says the triangle is right-angled. Since one of the angles is \( 90\degree \), Tom is correct. A triangle with angles \( 90\degree, 50\degree, 40\degree \) does indeed have one right angle.

## 2: Evaluate Katie's statement
Katie says the triangle is isosceles. For a triangle to be isosceles, it must have two sides of equal length, which corresponds to having two equal angles. However, the angles given are \( 90\degree, 50\degree, \) and \( 40\degree \), all of which are different. Therefore, Katie is incorrect.

## 3: Determine the correctness of statements
- Tom is correct because the triangle has a \( 90\degree \) angle.
- Katie is incorrect because the triangle does not have two equal angles.

## 4: Analyze student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic properties of triangles. They might not recognize a right-angled triangle or understand what makes a triangle isosceles. However, the presence of a \( 90\degree \) angle is a strong cue for a right-angled triangle. They might incorrectly identify the triangle as isosceles due to confusion or lack of understanding. 
  - A (Only Tom): Could be chosen by a significant number who understand right-angled but not isosceles.
  - B (Both Tom and Katie): Unlikely because it requires understanding both properties correctly.
  - C (Only Katie): Might be chosen by those who mistakenly think the triangle could be isosceles.
  - D (Neither are correct): Unlikely because Tom's statement is obviously correct.

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding. They should easily identify Tom as correct but might still be confused about Katie's statement.
  - A (Only Tom): High likelihood because they understand right-angled triangles.
  - B (Both Tom and Katie): Lower likelihood due to correct identification of Tom but potential misunderstanding of Katie.
  - C (Only Katie): Unlikely because basic understanding should help them see Katie's mistake.
  - D (Neither are correct): Unlikely because Tom is correct.

- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid grasp of geometry. They should easily recognize Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrectness.
  - A (Only Tom): High likelihood.
  - B (Both Tom and Katie): Unlikely.
  - C (Only Katie): Unlikely.
  - D (Neither are correct): Unlikely.

- **Advanced**: These students have a deep understanding and should effortlessly identify the correctness of Tom's statement and the incorrectness of Katie's.
  - A (Only Tom): Very high likelihood.
  - B (Both Tom and Katie): Very unlikely.
  - C (Only Katie): Very unlikely.
  - D (Neither are correct): Highly unlikely.

## 5: Predict Percentage of Students at Each Ability Level

Given the analysis:

- **Below Basic**: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **Basic**: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
- **Advanced**: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
