To approach this question, let's consider the properties of the quadrilaterals mentioned and the concept of rotational symmetry.

- **Trapezium**: A trapezium has no rotational symmetry (or order 1, if you consider a 360-degree rotation as a trivial case, but typically we look for symmetries that are not the identity).
- **Irregular quadrilateral**: An irregular quadrilateral generally has no rotational symmetry (again, order 1 for a 360-degree rotation).
- **Parallelogram**: A parallelogram has rotational symmetry of order 2, meaning it looks the same after rotation by 180 degrees.
- **Order of rotational symmetry**: This refers to how many times a shape can be rotated by a certain angle (less than 360 degrees) and still look the same.

The question essentially tests students' understanding of rotational symmetry in quadrilaterals. Given the options:
A: Trapezium
B: Irregular quadrilateral
C: Parallelogram
D: They each have the same order of rotational symmetry

## Step 1: Understanding student levels
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students may struggle with basic geometry concepts. They might not accurately recall properties of quadrilaterals or might confuse them.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might make some conceptual errors or not apply knowledge accurately in all contexts.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students have a solid grasp of geometric concepts, including properties of various quadrilaterals and understanding of symmetry.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand these concepts well but can also apply them to more complex problems and reason about properties effectively.

## 2: Analyzing the question for potential pitfalls
The question does not present a complex mathematical calculation but rather requires an understanding of geometric properties. A common misconception could be not recognizing the parallelogram's symmetry or incorrectly assuming all quadrilaterals have the same symmetry properties.

## 3: Predicting student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students might choose randomly or based on a very superficial understanding. Given the options, they might lean towards B (Irregular quadrilateral) or D (They each have the same), as these might seem "safe" or they might not understand the concept well enough to differentiate.
- **Basic**: Students here might recall that a parallelogram has some symmetry and could select C. They might also mistakenly think a trapezium or irregular quadrilateral has more symmetry than it does, leading to A or B.
- **Proficient**: These students should recognize the parallelogram has an order of rotational symmetry of 2. They should also understand that trapeziums and irregular quadrilaterals typically do not have rotational symmetry greater than 1, making C the correct choice.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students would easily identify the parallelogram as having the highest order of rotational symmetry (order 2) compared to the others.

## 4: Estimating percentages
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20% (reflecting confusion and lack of understanding)
- **Basic**: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15% (showing some understanding but potential for error)
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10% (demonstrating good understanding with some minor errors)
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5% (showing strong understanding with minimal errors)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
