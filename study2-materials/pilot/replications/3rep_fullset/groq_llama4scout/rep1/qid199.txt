To approach this question, let's first understand what makes a number rational and then analyze the options given.

A rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) of two integers, where \( p \) is an integer and \( q \) is a non-zero integer. 

Given the numbers \( \sqrt{36} \) and \( \sqrt{12} \), let's evaluate them:

1. \( \sqrt{36} = 6 \) because \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \). Since 6 is an integer, and it can be written as \( \frac{6}{1} \), \( \sqrt{36} \) is rational.

2. \( \sqrt{12} \) cannot be simplified into an integer because there is no integer that, when multiplied by itself, equals 12. However, \( \sqrt{12} \) can be expressed as \( \sqrt{4 \times 3} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3} \). Since \( \sqrt{3} \) is an irrational number (it cannot be expressed as a simple fraction), \( \sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3} \) is also irrational.

Now, let's consider how students at different levels might respond:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic concepts of square roots and rational numbers. They might not correctly identify \( \sqrt{36} \) as 6 or might not understand what makes a number rational. There's a high chance they could pick \( \sqrt{12} \) as rational because it "looks" like it could be simplified or because they misunderstand the concept of rational numbers. 
  - \( \sqrt{36} \) seems straightforward, but \( \sqrt{12} \) might confuse them.
  - **Prediction**: below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp of basic mathematical operations but might still struggle with more nuanced concepts like the difference between rational and irrational numbers. They should recognize \( \sqrt{36} \) as rational but might be unsure about \( \sqrt{12} \).
  - **Prediction**: basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%

- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid understanding of mathematical concepts, including the nature of rational and irrational numbers. They should easily identify \( \sqrt{36} \) as rational and \( \sqrt{12} \) as irrational.
  - **Prediction**: proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them to more complex problems. They would certainly know that \( \sqrt{36} \) is rational and \( \sqrt{12} \) is irrational.
  - **Prediction**: advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

Therefore, the predicted percentages are:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
