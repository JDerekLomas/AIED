To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question of writing \( 0.07 \) as a percentage, let's consider the nature of the question and common misconceptions.

The question requires converting a decimal to a percentage, which is a fundamental skill in mathematics. The correct conversion involves multiplying by 100 or moving the decimal point two places to the right. Thus, \( 0.07 \) becomes \( 7\% \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Options
- Option A: \( 7 \% \) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \( \frac{7}{100} \) is equivalent to \( 0.07 \) or \( 7\% \) but is not in percentage form as requested.
- Option C: \( 70 \% \) would be the result of incorrectly converting \( 0.07 \) to a percentage by possibly multiplying by 1000 or misinterpreting the decimal.
- Option D: \( 0.07 \% \) suggests a misunderstanding of the conversion process, possibly thinking \( 0.07 \) percent is being asked for rather than \( 0.07 \) converted to a percent.

## 2: Analyzing Student Responses by Ability Level

### Below Basic
Students at this level often struggle with basic conversions and may not fully understand the concept of percentages. 
- They might choose A correctly if they've been exposed to simple conversions.
- B could be chosen if they misunderstand the question or are unsure about percentages.
- C might be selected if they overestimate the value.
- D could be chosen out of confusion.

### Basic
At this level, students have a grasp of basic mathematical operations but might still make careless mistakes.
- A is likely to be chosen correctly as the concept is straightforward.
- B might be selected by those not fully understanding the request for a percentage.
- C and D are less likely but could still occur due to miscalculation or confusion.

### Proficient
Proficient students understand the conversion process well.
- A is expected to be the most common choice.
- B, C, and D are less likely as proficient students should recognize the correct form and reject incorrect ones.

### Advanced
Advanced students not only understand the conversion but are also less likely to make simple errors.
- A is the obvious choice.
- B, C, and D should be rarely chosen as advanced students have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts.

## 3: Prediction
Given the above analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=60% (some understanding of basic conversion), B=20% (confusion with fraction), C=10% (overestimation), D=10% (misunderstanding of percentage concept).
- **Basic**: A=80% (correct understanding), B=10% (some confusion), C=5% (careless mistake), D=5% (rare but possible mistake).
- **Proficient**: A=95% (strong understanding), B=3% (unlikely but possible), C=1% (rare mistake), D=1% (rare misunderstanding).
- **Advanced**: A=99% (excellent understanding), B=0.5% (very rare), C=0.25% (extremely rare), D=0.25% (extremely rare).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%
