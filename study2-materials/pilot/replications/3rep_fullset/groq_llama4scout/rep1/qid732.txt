To solve this, let's analyze the question and the given options.

## Step 1: Understand the Inequalities
The given inequalities are \(2 < x + y\) and \(x < y\). We need to find which of the provided coordinates satisfies both inequalities.

## 2: Analyze the First Inequality \(2 < x + y\)
This inequality describes a region in the coordinate plane. The line \(x + y = 2\) can be graphed, and the inequality \(2 < x + y\) represents all points above this line.

## 3: Analyze the Second Inequality \(x < y\)
This inequality represents all points below the line \(y = x\), because for any point \((x, y)\) below this line, \(y\) is greater than \(x\).

## 4: Examine the Options
Let's examine each option:
- A: \((3, 1)\)
- B: \((1, 1)\)
- C: \((1, 3)\)
- D: \((-3, 1)\)

## 5: Test Each Option Against Both Inequalities
### Option A: \((3, 1)\)
- \(2 < 3 + 1\) simplifies to \(2 < 4\), which is true.
- \(3 < 1\) is false.

### Option B: \((1, 1)\)
- \(2 < 1 + 1\) simplifies to \(2 < 2\), which is false.
- \(1 < 1\) is false.

### Option C: \((1, 3)\)
- \(2 < 1 + 3\) simplifies to \(2 < 4\), which is true.
- \(1 < 3\) is true.

### Option D: \((-3, 1)\)
- \(2 < -3 + 1\) simplifies to \(2 < -2\), which is false.
- \(-3 < 1\) is true.

## 6: Determine the Correct Option
Only option C: \((1, 3)\) satisfies both inequalities.

## 7: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding inequalities and graphing. They might not accurately assess which side of the lines the points fall into. Given the simplicity of the question and the clear graphical representation, even students below basic might be able to eliminate obviously incorrect options (like B and D) but could struggle to accurately place (3,1) and (1,3) in relation to both lines. However, without strong conceptual understanding, they might guess or incorrectly apply the inequalities. 
  - A=30% (might seem plausible but incorrect), B=20% (easy to see doesn't fit), C=30% (correct but requires understanding), D=20% (obviously doesn't fit the first inequality).

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless errors or not fully understand the inequalities. 
  - A=20%, B=10%, C=60%, D=10%

- **Proficient**: Students with a good grasp of inequalities and graphing should easily identify the correct answer.
  - A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concepts but can apply them quickly and accurately.
  - A=5%, B=0%, C=90%, D=5%

## 8: Format the Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
- proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
- advanced: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%
