To approach this question, let's consider the common misconceptions and the simplicity of the expression given.

The expression to factorize is \(p^{2} + 4p\). This is a straightforward expression that can be factorized by taking out the common factor \(p\), resulting in \(p(p + 4)\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Expression
The given expression is \(p^{2} + 4p\). To factorize it, we look for common factors. Here, \(p\) is common, so we can factor \(p\) out: \(p(p + 4)\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception in factorization is not recognizing the common factor or incorrectly expanding/factoring expressions. For the expression \(p^{2} + 4p\), a potential mistake could be trying to factor it into two binomials that multiply to give \(p^{2} + 4p\), but without a constant term to work with (like in \(p^{2} + 5p + 6\)), the factorization is relatively straightforward.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \((p-2)(p+2) = p^{2} - 4\), which does not match \(p^{2} + 4p\).
- B: \(p(p+4)\), which matches our factorization.
- C: \((p+2)(p+2) = (p+2)^{2} = p^{2} + 4p + 4\), which does not match \(p^{2} + 4p\).
- D: Does not factorise, which is incorrect since \(p(p+4)\) is a valid factorization.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic factorization. They might choose A or C because they recognize the \(p^{2}\) and \(4p\) but incorrectly manipulate them, or they might not see the simple factorization and choose D. B=40% (correct but could be guessed), A=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to factor out \(p\), so B seems the most likely. A=10%, B=70%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with factorization and should easily identify B. A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are confident and should have no issues with this question. A=2%, B=92%, C=2%, D=4%.

## 5: Adjusting for Realistic Expectations
Given typical student performance and common mistakes:
- **Below Basic**: A=15%, B=30%, C=20%, D=35%
- **Basic**: A=5%, B=80%, C=5%, D=10%
- **Proficient**: A=2%, B=90%, C=2%, D=6%
- **Advanced**: A=1%, B=95%, C=1%, D=3%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=20% D=35%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=90% C=2% D=6%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
