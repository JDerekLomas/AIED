To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the task
The task involves subtracting one equation from another to solve a pair of simultaneous equations. The equations given are:
1) \(6g + h = 12\)
2) \(6g - 3h = -3\)

## 2: Perform the subtraction
Subtracting the second equation from the first gives:
\((6g + h) - (6g - 3h) = 12 - (-3)\)
This simplifies to:
\(6g + h - 6g + 3h = 12 + 3\)
Which further simplifies to:
\(4h = 15\)

## 3: Analyze the options
The correct result of the subtraction is \(4h = 15\), which corresponds to option D.

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and errors
A common error might involve incorrect handling of the subtraction, especially with the signs. For example, some might incorrectly subtract to get \(-2h = 15\) (option B) or mistakenly add the equations or incorrectly handle the negatives.

## 5: Assess difficulty by ability level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and could easily make errors in subtraction, such as not properly distributing the negative sign or misaligning terms. They might choose A or B due to confusion with signs or operations.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should have a grasp of basic algebraic operations but might still make careless mistakes. They are likely to understand the concept of subtracting equations but could make simple arithmetic errors.
- **Proficient**: Students here should be able to perform the subtraction accurately but might occasionally make a mistake if they're not paying close attention. They're less likely to choose incorrect options unless under time pressure or if they misread the question.
- **Advanced**: These students are expected to handle algebraic manipulations with ease and are less likely to make errors in simple operations like this.

## 6: Predict percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the operations involved:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40% (Many will struggle, and errors in sign or arithmetic are common)
- **Basic**: A=10% B=15% C=5% D=70% (Most will get it right, but some residual errors)
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=2% D=88% (High accuracy, minor errors)
- **Advanced**: A=2% B=2% C=1% D=95% (Very high accuracy, rare errors)

The best answer is D.
