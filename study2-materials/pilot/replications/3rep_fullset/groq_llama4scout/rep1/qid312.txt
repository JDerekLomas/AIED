To approach this question, let's consider the common misconceptions and the simplicity of the expression given.

The expression \(a^{2} \times a\) is a straightforward application of the rule for multiplying like bases, which states that when multiplying powers with the same base, you add the exponents. Therefore, \(a^{2} \times a = a^{2+1} = a^{3}\).

## Step 1: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve adding or multiplying the coefficients (or in this case, treating the \(a\) as a coefficient) or misapplying the exponent rule. However, the question is quite straightforward.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \(2a^{2}\), suggests a misunderstanding where the student might think they're adding \(a^{2}\) to \(a\), or misinterpreting the operation. This seems unlikely for more proficient students but could trap some lower-ability students.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \(3a\), implies a completely incorrect application of rules, possibly confusing the multiplication of \(a^{2}\) and \(a\) with an addition of exponents or coefficients. This option seems to test a deeper misunderstanding.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \(a^{3}\), is the correct answer. This requires the student to remember and correctly apply the rule for multiplying like bases.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D, "Does not simplify," would be chosen by a student who either does not know the rule or thinks the expression cannot be simplified further, which is incorrect in this context.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students may not fully grasp exponent rules. They might confuse operations or not apply the exponent rule correctly. So, we might see:
  - A: 20% (misinterpreting the operation)
  - B: 30% (completely misunderstanding)
  - C: 30% (some get it right by chance or basic understanding)
  - D: 20% (not knowing what to do)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 15%
  - C: 60% (most understand the basic rule)
  - D: 15%

- **Proficient:** These students are familiar with the rules and should apply them correctly.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 85%
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only know the rules but can also apply them in complex situations. They should easily get this right.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 0%
  - C: 95%
  - D: 5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
