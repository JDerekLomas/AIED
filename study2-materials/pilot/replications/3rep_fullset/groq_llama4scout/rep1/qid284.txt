To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question asks to write the number \( 60302 \) in words. The correct answer is B) Six thousand three hundred and two.

## Step 1: Understanding the Number
The number \( 60302 \) can be broken down into its place values: \( 60,000 + 3,000 + 0 + 300 + 2 \), which translates to sixty thousand, three hundred and two.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
- A common misconception might involve misinterpreting the thousands and hundreds places.
- Another could be misunderstanding the decimal or thousands separator, though this is less likely with a simple number like \( 60302 \).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A) Six hundred and thirty-two: This option incorrectly suggests the number is much smaller than \( 60302 \).
- B) Six thousand three hundred and two: This seems plausible but does not account for the \( 60,000 \) part.
- C) Sixty thousand and thirty-two: This option mistakenly omits the hundreds place value.
- D) Sixty thousand three hundred and two: This is the correct translation.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with place value. They might not understand the concept of thousands and hundreds well, leading to confusion. Option A seems too low but very plausible due to a lack of understanding. Option B might seem right because it acknowledges thousands but not the sixty thousand part. Option C could be chosen due to omission of the hundred's place. Option D is less likely to be chosen due to its accuracy requiring a good understanding of place value.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors, especially if they misread or misunderstand the number. They might lean towards B because it correctly identifies thousands but not the scale correctly.
- **Proficient**: These students understand place value and are less likely to make errors. They should predominantly choose D.
- **Advanced**: These students have a strong understanding and are unlikely to make mistakes, so they should choose D.

## 5: Estimation
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (simple, small numbers), B=25% (thousands but not scale), C=20% (omitting hundreds), D=25% (correct but challenging).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=30%, C=10%, D=50%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=10%, C=5%, D=80%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=10% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
