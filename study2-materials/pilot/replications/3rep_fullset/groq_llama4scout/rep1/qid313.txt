To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions.

The question tests the understanding of multiplying a positive number by a negative number, which results in a negative product. The correct answer is \( -15 \), which corresponds to option B.

1. **Misconception about signs**: A common misconception among students is forgetting or misunderstanding the rules about signs in multiplication. Students might think that multiplying two numbers with different signs results in a positive number (which would lead them to choose A: \( 15 \)).

2. **Basic Multiplication Facts**: For students who have a solid grasp of basic multiplication facts but struggle with applying rules for negative numbers, or those who simply make careless errors, options C (\( 8 \)) and D (\( -8 \)) could be tempting if they incorrectly calculate \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) and then mistakenly adjust for the negative sign.

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle significantly with basic multiplication facts and the concept of negative numbers. They might choose A (\( 15 \)) because they ignore the negative sign or choose C or D due to a complete misunderstanding of multiplication. Let's predict: A=40% (completely ignoring the negative), B=20% (correct but this might be a guess for some), C=20%, D=20%.

- **Basic**: At this level, students are expected to have a grasp of basic multiplication but might still struggle with negative numbers. They are likely to apply a correct rule for multiplication but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. Let's predict: A=20% (misapplying the rule), B=60% (applying correctly), C=10%, D=10%.

- **Proficient**: Students here should understand the rules for negative numbers and multiplication. However, simple lapses in attention could lead to errors. Let's predict: A=5% (careless or misunderstanding), B=90% (correct understanding), C=2%, D=3%.

- **Advanced**: These students have a solid grasp and are less likely to make errors on straightforward calculations like this. Let's predict: A=1% (very careless), B=98% (correct), C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

Therefore, based on predicted student responses:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%
