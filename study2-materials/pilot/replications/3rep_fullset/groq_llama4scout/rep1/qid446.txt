To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and how students at different levels might respond.

The question involves reflecting a point \( Q(2,5) \) in the line \( x=2 \). Reflecting a point in a vertical line \( x=a \) changes the \( x \) coordinate to \( 2a - x \) (since the distance from \( x \) to \( a \) is \( |x - a| \), and on the other side of \( a \), the new \( x \) coordinate is \( a + |x - a| = 2a - x \)), while the \( y \) coordinate remains the same. For \( x=2 \), the new \( x \) coordinate is \( 2*2 - 2 = 2 \), and the \( y \) coordinate stays \( 5 \).

So, the correct answer is A: \( (2,5) \), because reflecting a point in the line \( x=2 \) when the point is already on \( x=2 \) doesn't change its coordinates.

Let's predict the responses based on student ability levels:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand coordinate geometry or reflections. They might mistakenly think reflecting across \( x=2 \) changes both coordinates or doesn't change them at all in a wrong way. There's a chance they pick B because they misunderstand reflection as a 180-degree rotation or another incorrect transformation. 
  - A=40% (some understand it's on the line, but this might be a guess)
  - B=30% (thinking a reflection across the y-axis or another incorrect transformation)
  - C=15% (mix-up with swapping coordinates)
  - D=15% (thinking reflection across the x-axis)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may struggle with nuances. They are likely to realize the point doesn't move if it's on the line of reflection but might be tempted by incorrect options if they misunderstand the concept of reflection.
  - A=60% (understanding the concept that a point on the line of reflection doesn't move)
  - B=20% (incorrectly applying a different transformation)
  - C=10% (swapping coordinates incorrectly)
  - D=10% (thinking it's a reflection across the x-axis)

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of coordinate geometry and are likely to understand that reflecting a point across a line it lies on results in no change.
  - A=80% (correct understanding)
  - B=10% (maybe overthinking or misapplying a transformation)
  - C=5% (unlikely but possible mistake)
  - D=5% (unlikely mistake)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are confident and have a deep understanding. They are unlikely to make mistakes on such a straightforward question.
  - A=95% (correct answer with confidence)
  - B=3% (virtually no chance of selecting an incorrect option)
  - C=1% 
  - D=1%

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
