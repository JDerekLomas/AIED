To solve this, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding that students at different levels might have.

The question asks for the name of a quadrilateral with four equal sides. The correct answer is a rhombus, which is a quadrilateral with all sides of equal length. An arrowhead, often referred to in the context of a kite, has two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal, not necessarily four equal sides, although a special case of a kite (a square) does have four equal sides, a general arrowhead or kite does not.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The misconception here could be that students might not be aware that a rhombus specifically requires all sides to be of equal length, or they might confuse it with other quadrilaterals like a kite (or arrowhead), which has two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal.

## 2: Analyzing Student Responses by Ability Level

- **below_basic:** Students at this level might not have a clear understanding of the properties of different quadrilaterals. They might confuse a rhombus with a kite or an arrowhead. Given that Tom says "arrowhead" and Katie says "rhombus," and knowing that an arrowhead (or kite) isn't typically defined by having all sides equal, but can be a special case (square), there's potential for confusion. However, the straightforward nature of the question (focusing on "four equal sides") might still lead many to recognize Katie as correct due to basic recall.

- **basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding of quadrilaterals and might recall that a rhombus has all sides equal. They might not be as familiar with an arrowhead having specific properties or might not immediately recall it's generally not defined by all sides being equal. Thus, they could lean towards Katie but might be uncertain about Tom.

- **proficient:** Students at this level are likely to know that a rhombus is defined by having four equal sides. They might also recognize that an arrowhead (or kite) does not necessarily have four equal sides unless it's a specific type like a square. Therefore, they would likely agree with Katie and disagree with Tom, unless they consider the special case of a square (which is both a rhombus and a kite).

- **advanced:** Advanced students are likely to have a deep understanding of the properties of various quadrilaterals. They would know that a rhombus has four equal sides and that a square (a special rhombus) could be considered an "arrowhead" in some contexts but specifically fits the description given.

## 3: Predicting Responses

Given these considerations:

- **below_basic:** A=20% (Some might mistakenly agree with Tom due to lack of understanding), B=60% (Recognize Katie as correct due to basic recall), C=10% (Unlikely to see both as correct without understanding), D=10% (Might not recognize either due to confusion).
  
- **basic:** A=15% (Less likely to be confused), B=70% (More likely to recognize Katie), C=5% (Very few would see both as correct), D=10%.

- **proficient:** A=5% (Recognize the error in Tom's statement), B=85% (Understand Katie is correct), C=5% (For those who consider special cases like a square), D=5%.

- **advanced:** A=0% (Would not agree with Tom), B=95% (Understand Katie's correctness), C=5% (Considering special cases), D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=5% D=0%
