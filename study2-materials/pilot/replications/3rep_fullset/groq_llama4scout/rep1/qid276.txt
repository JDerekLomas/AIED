## Step 1: Understand the question and the Venn diagram
The question presents a Venn diagram with two circles representing sets P and Q. Set P contains "crisps" and "sweets" within its circle and the intersection, respectively. Set Q contains "pizza" and "sweets" in a similar manner. The area outside both circles is labeled "chocolate." The task is to identify which elements are in \( P^{\prime} \), the complement of set P.

## 2: Identify elements in \( P^{\prime} \)
\( P^{\prime} \) refers to all elements not in set P. From the Venn diagram, set P includes "crisps" and "sweets". Therefore, \( P^{\prime} \) includes "pizza" and "chocolate" because these are the elements not in set P. It's also important to note that "sweets" is in set P, so it is not in \( P^{\prime} \).

## 3: Analyze the options given
- A: crisps
- B: crisps & sweets
- C: pizza & chocolate
- D: sweets, pizza & chocolate

## 4: Determine the correct answer
The correct answer is C: pizza & chocolate, as these are the elements not in set P, hence in \( P^{\prime} \).

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding set notation and Venn diagrams. They might incorrectly assume \( P^{\prime} \) includes elements of P or misunderstand the complement. Option A (crisps) could appeal to those who only consider elements within one set without understanding complements. Option D could attract students who mistakenly include "sweets" as it's a common element but actually in P. So, A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still make mistakes. They are more likely to eliminate A and B because they see "crisps" and "sweets" are in P. Between C and D, they might choose D due to a lack of understanding of set complements. So, A=10%, B=5%, C=60%, D=25%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand set theory well and can apply it. They should easily identify \( P^{\prime} \) as including "pizza" and "chocolate", making C the correct choice. So, A=0%, B=0%, C=90%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand set theory but can also analyze complex diagrams and questions. They would quickly and accurately choose C. So, A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 6: Format the predictions
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=60% D=25%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
