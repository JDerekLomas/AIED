## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a diagram of a straight line intersected by two other lines, forming several angles. The goal is to find the size of angle \( q \). The given angles are \( 126^\circ \) and \( 37^\circ \).

## 2: Identifying Relevant Concepts
To solve this, students need to recall that the sum of angles on a straight line is \( 180^\circ \). This concept is crucial for finding missing angles.

## 3: Analyzing the Angles
Given that one angle is \( 126^\circ \), the adjacent angle on the straight line can be found by \( 180^\circ - 126^\circ = 54^\circ \). For the other intersection, one angle is \( 37^\circ \), but to find \( q \), we don't directly need this since \( q \) and \( 54^\circ \) are on the same side of the line intersecting the straight line.

## 4: Finding Angle \( q \)
The angle \( q \) and \( 37^\circ \) are supplementary to the \( 54^\circ \) angle on the straight line intersected by the line that forms \( q \) and the \( 37^\circ \) angle. However, to directly find \( q \), note that \( q + 37^\circ = 54^\circ \) because \( q \) and \( 37^\circ \) together form the \( 54^\circ \) angle.

## 5: Calculation
So, \( q = 54^\circ - 37^\circ = 17^\circ \).

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic angle concepts. They might incorrectly assume \( q \) is equal to one of the given angles or not understand how angles on a straight line relate. Option A (\( 37^\circ \)) might seem plausible because it's directly given, so A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here understand basic geometry but might make simple calculation errors. They should know angles on a straight line add up to \( 180^\circ \) but might struggle with the relationship between angles formed by intersecting lines. B=50%, C=20%, A=15%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students are familiar with angle properties and can apply them. They should easily calculate \( q \) as \( 17^\circ \). So, C=80%, B=10%, A=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts quickly. They would confirm \( q = 17^\circ \) without hesitation. Thus, C=95%, B=3%, A=1%, D=1%.

## 7: Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the predicted percentages for each ability level are as follows:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=50% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=3% C=95% D=1%
