## Step 1: Understand the question and the statements made by Tom and Katie
The question presents a scenario where Tom and Katie discuss the heights of 5 plants and make statements about how changes in these heights affect the range. The original heights of the plants are given as \(23 \mathrm{~cm}, 17 \mathrm{~cm}, 40 \mathrm{~cm}, 25 \mathrm{~cm},\) and \(31 \mathrm{~cm}\). Tom claims that if all the plants double in height, the range won't change. Katie claims that if all the plants grow by \(12 \mathrm{~cm}\) each, the range won't change.

## 2: Determine the original range of the plants' heights
To assess the claims, first, we need to find the original range. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values. The highest height is \(40 \mathrm{~cm}\) and the lowest is \(17 \mathrm{~cm}\), so the original range is \(40 - 17 = 23 \mathrm{~cm}\).

## 3: Evaluate Tom's statement
Tom says that if all the plants double in height, the range won't change. If all plants double, their new heights would be \(46 \mathrm{~cm}, 34 \mathrm{~cm}, 80 \mathrm{~cm}, 50 \mathrm{~cm},\) and \(62 \mathrm{~cm}\). The new range would be \(80 - 34 = 46 \mathrm{~cm}\). Since \(46 \mathrm{~cm}\) is not equal to \(23 \mathrm{~cm} \times 2 = 46 \mathrm{~cm}\) but actually is, because both the highest and lowest values are doubled, the range actually doubles in the relative sense but the proportional change is consistent. However, my initial analysis was incorrect in stating the outcome; the range does indeed double from 23cm to 46cm, which means Tom is incorrect because the range does change.

## 4: Evaluate Katie's statement
Katie says that if all the plants grow by \(12 \mathrm{~cm}\) each, the range won't change. If each plant grows by \(12 \mathrm{~cm}\), their new heights would be \(35 \mathrm{~cm}, 29 \mathrm{~cm}, 52 \mathrm{~cm}, 37 \mathrm{~cm},\) and \(43 \mathrm{~cm}\). The new range would be \(52 - 29 = 23 \mathrm{~cm}\). Since this is still \(23 \mathrm{~cm}\), Katie is correct.

## 5: Assess the correctness of Tom and Katie's statements
From the evaluations, Tom is incorrect because doubling the heights of all plants changes the range from \(23 \mathrm{~cm}\) to \(46 \mathrm{~cm}\). Katie is correct because adding \(12 \mathrm{~cm}\) to each plant's height does not change the range, which remains \(23 \mathrm{~cm}\).

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of range and how changes in data affect it. They might not fully grasp the implications of doubling versus adding a constant. Expect a high percentage to choose incorrectly, possibly A or D, due to misunderstanding or lack of calculation.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in applying concepts to new situations. They might understand the concept of range but struggle with applying it to doubling and adding. A significant percentage might choose B (Only Katie), with some choosing D (Neither is correct) due to not fully understanding Tom's claim.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should understand the effects of linear transformations on the range. They should recognize that adding a constant to all values does not change the range but doubling all values does. Expect a high percentage to choose B (Only Katie).
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately and reason about the effects of different transformations. They should easily identify that Katie is correct and Tom is incorrect, leading to a high percentage choosing B (Only Katie).

## 7: Assign percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (misunderstanding doubling effect), B=20% (some understanding of Katie's correctness), C=10% (both correct, unlikely), D=40% (total misunderstanding).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=40%, C=15%, D=25%.
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=60%, C=5%, D=25%.
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=80%, C=5%, D=10%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25
