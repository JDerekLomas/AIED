To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question requires students to express a given ratio \(3:2\) in the form \(1:n\). This involves dividing both parts of the ratio by 3 to get the 1 in the \(1:n\) format.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to convert \(3:2\) into \(1:n\). To do this, we divide both parts of the ratio by 3, resulting in \(1:\frac{2}{3}\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not understanding how to convert ratios or making calculation errors. However, given the simplicity of the numbers and the operation required, the main challenge lies in executing the division correctly and understanding the ratio format.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \(1:1.5\) - This is equivalent to \(1:\frac{3}{2}\) or \(2:3\), not \(3:2\).
- B: \(1:\frac{2}{3}\) - This matches our calculation.
- C: \(1:0\) - This would imply a ratio where one part is zero, which doesn't relate to sharing sweets in a \(3:2\) ratio.
- D: \(1:6\) - This implies a much larger second part than the first, which is incorrect.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic ratio concepts or converting between ratio forms. They might incorrectly choose A due to a misunderstanding of ratio conversion or choose C/D due to lack of understanding or calculation errors. 
  - A: 40% (intuitive but incorrect conversion)
  - B: 20% (correct but might require guidance)
  - C: 20% (misunderstanding of ratios)
  - D: 20% (miscalculation or incorrect concept application)
  
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple errors. They are more likely to understand the concept but could choose A due to calculation mistakes.
  - A: 30% 
  - B: 60% 
  - C: 5% 
  - D: 5%

- **Proficient:** These students understand ratios well and are less likely to make errors in conversion. They should predominantly choose B.
  - A: 10% 
  - B: 85% 
  - C: 2% 
  - D: 3%

- **Advanced:** Advanced students are very comfortable with ratios and conversions, so they should almost universally choose B.
  - A: 5% 
  - B: 95% 
  - C: 0% 
  - D: 0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=85% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=5% B=95% C=0% D=0%
