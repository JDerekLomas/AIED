To approach this question, let's first recall that for two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be -1. The given line is \(y = 3x - 2\), which means its slope is 3.

## Step1: Identify the slope of the given line
The slope of the given line \(y = 3x - 2\) is 3.

##2: Recall the condition for perpendicular lines
For two lines to be perpendicular, their slopes must multiply to -1. Therefore, the slope of a line perpendicular to \(y = 3x - 2\) must be \(-\frac{1}{3}\), because \(3 \times -\frac{1}{3} = -1\).

##3: Analyze option A
Option A is \(y = \frac{1}{3}x + 1\). The slope here is \(\frac{1}{3}\), not \(-\frac{1}{3}\), so it's not perpendicular.

##4: Analyze option B
Option B is \(y = 5 - \frac{1}{3}x\). This can be rewritten as \(y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 5\), which means its slope is \(-\frac{1}{3}\). This line is perpendicular to \(y = 3x - 2\).

##5: Analyze option C
Option C is \(y = 3x + 7\). The slope here is 3, which means it's parallel to the given line, not perpendicular.

##6: Analyze option D
Option D is \(x = 3y - 4\). This can be rewritten as \(y = \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{4}{3}\), which means its slope is \(\frac{1}{3}\), not \(-\frac{1}{3}\), so it's not perpendicular.

##7: Consider student understanding at different levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with rearranging equations, understanding slope, or applying the formula for perpendicular lines. They might choose options based on superficial similarities or incorrect calculations. Expect a high chance of error.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might not apply them accurately under pressure. They might recognize the need for a negative reciprocal slope but could struggle with rearranging some equations or might miscalculate.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and can apply them. They should easily identify the correct slope and choose the right option, with fewer errors.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them efficiently and accurately. They are less likely to make errors.

##8: Predict student responses
Given the question's clarity and the straightforward application of the perpendicular slope rule:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20% (Many might pick A or C due to not understanding the slope concept or misinterpreting the equations.)
- **Basic**: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10% (Most should recognize the slope requirement, leading to B being the most popular choice.)
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5% (Accurate application of the concept leads to a high percentage choosing B.)
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5% (High accuracy in identifying the correct option.)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
