To solve this, let's analyze the statements made by Jo and Paul and evaluate their correctness.

Jo says \( 9^{4}=3^{8} \). To check this, we can express 9 as \( 3^2 \), so \( 9^4 = (3^2)^4 = 3^{2*4} = 3^8 \). Therefore, Jo is correct.

Paul says \( 9^{4}=3^{2} \times 3^{2} \). This can be simplified as \( 3^2 \times 3^2 = 3^{2+2} = 3^4 \). However, \( 9^4 = 3^8 \), not \( 3^4 \). So, Paul is incorrect because \( 9^4 = 3^8 \), not \( 3^2 \times 3^2 \).

Given this analysis, the correct answer is A) Only Jo.

Now, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the basics of exponent rules. They might not correctly simplify \( 9^4 \) or \( 3^8 \), and could easily be confused by the statements.
  - A=30% (some recognition of Jo's correctness but misunderstanding of Paul's)
  - B=20% (misunderstanding Paul's statement)
  - C=20% (not understanding either correctly)
  - D=30% (completely unsure or incorrect evaluation)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic math concepts but might still struggle with applying rules of exponents consistently.
  - A=50% (recognize Jo's correctness)
  - B=25% (might see Paul's as plausible but incorrect)
  - C=15% (think both could be right due to confusion)
  - D=10% (understand neither is correct but can't identify why)

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid understanding of algebraic rules, including exponent properties.
  - A=70% (clearly see Jo is correct)
  - B=10% (unlikely to think Paul is correct given they understand exponent rules)
  - C=15% (some might mistakenly think Paul's statement could be an alternative way of expressing \( 9^4 \))
  - D=5% (understand the mistake in both or one of the statements)

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand but can apply and possibly extend mathematical concepts.
  - A=90% (easily verify Jo's statement and disprove Paul's)
  - B=0% (unlikely to mistakenly endorse Paul)
  - C=5% (extremely unlikely to think both are correct given their advanced understanding)
  - D=5% (might consider if there's an exceptional or mistaken interpretation)

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
