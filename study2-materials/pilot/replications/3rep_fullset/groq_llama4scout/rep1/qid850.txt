To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions.

The equation given is \( y = x^2 \). The table of values provided is:
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline\( x \) & \(\bigstar\) \\
\hline\( y \) & \( 4 \) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
We need to determine if Jo or Paul is correct regarding the value of \( \bigstar \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Equation
The equation \( y = x^2 \) implies that for any value of \( x \), \( y \) will always be positive (or zero) because squaring a number always results in a non-negative value.

## 2: Evaluating Jo's Statement
Jo says the star could be \( 16 \). If \( x = 16 \), then \( y = 16^2 = 256 \), which does not match the given \( y = 4 \). However, if \( x = 2 \) or \( x = -2 \), then \( y = 2^2 = 4 \) or \( y = (-2)^2 = 4 \). This means Jo's suggestion that the star could be \( 2 \) or \( -2 \) is actually correct in the context of producing \( y = 4 \), but Jo specifically says \( 16 \), which is incorrect for \( y = 4 \).

## 3: Evaluating Paul's Statement
Paul says the star could be \( -2 \). Since \( (-2)^2 = 4 \), Paul is correct. The value of \( x \) can indeed be \( -2 \) to get \( y = 4 \).

## 4: Identifying the Correct Answer
Given that Paul is correct because \( (-2)^2 = 4 \), and realizing that Jo's statement about \( 16 \) is incorrect because \( 16^2 = 256 \) and not \( 4 \), but noting \( 2 \) would also work (which seems to be a confusion in Jo's statement), the actual question is about who is correct given their statements. Jo did not explicitly say \( 2 \), but the implication is about the possibility of \( x \) values leading to \( y = 4 \). Both \( 2 \) and \( -2 \) are valid \( x \) values.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \) in the equation \( y = x^2 \). They might not fully grasp that \( x \) can be negative and still yield a positive \( y \). Thus, they might incorrectly assess Jo and Paul's statements. 
  - A: Only Jo = 30% (some might think Jo's large number could somehow relate)
  - B: Only Paul = 20% (understanding negative \( x \) but not Jo's implication)
  - C: Both Jo and Paul = 10% (limited understanding)
  - D: Neither is correct = 40% (completely misunderstand)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still be prone to errors, especially with negative numbers.
  - A: Only Jo = 20%
  - B: Only Paul = 30%
  - C: Both Jo and Paul = 20% (starting to see relationships)
  - D: Neither is correct = 30%

- **Proficient**: These students understand the equation and can apply it.
  - A: Only Jo = 5% (recognize \( 16 \) doesn't fit)
  - B: Only Paul = 40% (know \( -2 \) works)
  - C: Both Jo and Paul = 5% (might mistakenly think Jo's \( 16 \) could fit in a different context)
  - D: Neither is correct = 50% (know \( 16 \) doesn't fit and Jo didn't say \( 2 \))

- **Advanced**: Students at this level can reason and apply their knowledge accurately.
  - A: Only Jo = 0% (know \( 16 \) is incorrect)
  - B: Only Paul = 80% (accurately identify \( -2 \) as a solution)
  - C: Both Jo and Paul = 5% (unlikely to mistakenly validate incorrect options)
  - D: Neither is correct = 15% (understand both statements' implications)

The best answer is B. 

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=40% C=5% D=50%
advanced: A=0% B=80% C=5% D=15%
