To solve this, let's consider the structure of the question and the potential pitfalls for students of different abilities.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a scenario with 24 people at an ice hockey match and provides a pie chart divided into sections representing different shirt colors. The task is to determine how many people wore red shirts based on the pie chart.

## 2: Analyzing the Pie Chart
The pie chart is divided into 8 equal sections. Out of these, 4 sections are yellow, 2 sections are red, 1 section is black, and 1 section is white. This means that out of 8 parts, 2 parts represent people wearing red shirts.

## 3: Calculating the Number of People Wearing Red Shirts
To find out how many people wore red shirts, we need to calculate \(\frac{2}{8}\) of 24, since 2 out of the 8 sections represent red shirts. Simplifying \(\frac{2}{8}\) gives \(\frac{1}{4}\). So, \(\frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with fractions and percentages, and may not understand how to interpret the pie chart or calculate proportions. They might choose an answer based on a superficial understanding or guess. Option A (6) seems correct but requires calculation. Option B (\(\frac{1}{4}\)) is a fraction but not a final numerical answer. Options C (3) and D (2) could be guesses or misinterpretations.
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to understand the pie chart and perform simple calculations. They might still struggle with converting the fraction of the pie chart into a number of people but should be able to calculate it with some effort. Incorrect options might include C (3) or D (2) if they misinterpret the chart or make a calculation error.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily understand the pie chart, calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 24, and arrive at 6. They are less likely to choose incorrect options unless they make a careless mistake.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only calculate the answer correctly (A=6) but also understand the context and potentially verify their calculations. They are the least likely to choose incorrect options.

## 5: Estimating Response Percentages
Given the calculation required and the potential for misunderstanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (if they can calculate or guess correctly), B=20% (misinterpreting the fraction as an answer), C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: A=60%, B=15%, C=10%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=85%, B=5%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%.

The best answer is A. 

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
