To solve this, let's first interpret the information given in the bar chart description and then assess how students at different ability levels might respond.

The bar chart shows the drinks sold in Caroline's Café on Monday and Tuesday. The Teas bar has a lower section (Monday's sales) that is 1 tick below 50 on the vertical scale, and the whole bar's height (total sales for Monday and Tuesday) is 2 ticks above 100 on the vertical scale.

## Step 1: Determine the scale
The vertical scale has ticks at 0, 50, 100, etc. This means each tick represents 50 units.

## 2: Calculate Monday's Tea sales
The lower section of the Teas bar is 1 tick below 50, which means Monday's Tea sales are approximately 50 - 10 = 40 units (assuming the tick interval is divided into 5 parts, each part representing 10 units, which is a reasonable assumption given the description).

## 3: Calculate total Tea sales (Monday + Tuesday)
The whole Teas bar's height is 2 ticks above 100, which means the total height is 100 + (2 * 50) = 200 units.

## 4: Calculate Tuesday's Tea sales
To find Tuesday's Tea sales, subtract Monday's sales from the total: 200 - 40 = 160 units.

However, let's reassess the calculation based on a more precise interpretation of the chart description:
- Monday's sales are 1 tick below 50, so approximately 40 (if we consider the tick divisions).
- The total (Monday + Tuesday) is 2 ticks above 100, so 100 + 2*50 = 200.

## 5: Reassess Tuesday's sales with correct interpretation
If the total height (Monday + Tuesday) is 2 ticks above 100, that's 150 (2 ticks * 50 + 100), not 200 as previously miscalculated. 
- The lower part (Monday) is just below 50, let's say 45 for simplicity.
- The total bar height is at 150 (2 ticks above 100), so Tuesday's sales would be 150 - 45 = 105.

Given the options and a more realistic estimation:
- The actual calculation seems to have been misinterpreted. Let's simplify:
  - Monday's tea sales are just under 50, say 45.
  - Total tea sales (Mon + Tue) are 2 ticks above 100, which equals 150.

## 6: Estimate Tuesday's Tea Sales
Tuesday's tea sales = Total sales - Monday's sales = 150 - 45 = 105.

## 7: Compare with Given Options
- A: 62
- B: 80
- C: 120
- D: 40

Given our estimate of approximately 105, the closest option is C: 120, considering the question asks for an approximation and students might round differently.

## 8: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle with reading the chart or calculating. They might choose D (40) because it's close to the Monday sales or simply misread the chart, A=20%, B=15%, C=30%, D=35%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level could approximate but might not accurately calculate. They might lean towards B=80 or C=120, A=25%, B=30%, C=30%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately interpret the chart and calculate. They are likely to choose C=120, A=10%, B=20%, C=60%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will accurately calculate and choose C=120. They might be less likely to choose incorrect options due to their strong understanding, A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.

The best answer is below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=25% B=30% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
