To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question on converting \( 5 \) kilometres and \( 7 \) centimetres into metres, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question requires converting \( 5 \) kilometres and \( 7 \) centimetres into metres. Recall that \( 1 \) kilometre = \( 1000 \) metres and \( 1 \) centimetre = \( 0.01 \) metres.

## Step 1: Understanding the Conversions
First, convert \( 5 \) kilometres to metres: \( 5 \times 1000 = 5000 \) metres.
Then, convert \( 7 \) centimetres to metres: \( 7 \times 0.01 = 0.07 \) metres.

## 2: Combining the Conversions
Adding these together: \( 5000 + 0.07 = 5000.07 \) metres.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( 5070 \mathrm{~m} \) suggests \( 5 \) km and \( 7 \) cm is equal to \( 5070 \) metres, which would be incorrect because it doesn't properly convert kilometres to metres and seems to add \( 5 \) and \( 7 \) in some incorrect units.
- B: \( 5000.07 \mathrm{~m} \) correctly converts \( 5 \) km to \( 5000 \) m and \( 7 \) cm to \( 0.07 \) m.
- C: \( 5007 \mathrm{~m} \) suggests adding \( 5 \) km (which is \( 5000 \) m) and \( 7 \) m, ignoring the centimetres.
- D: \( 5700 \mathrm{~m} \) is a completely incorrect conversion.

## 4: Identifying Misconceptions and Difficulty
The main misconception here could be not properly converting between units or misunderstanding how to combine different units of measurement. Students might struggle with converting centimetres to metres or not realizing that \( 5 \) km is \( 5000 \) metres.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand unit conversions well. They might choose A or D due to a lack of understanding of how to convert between units.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand basic conversions but could struggle with combining different types of units. They might choose C because they understand kilometres but not centimetres well.
- **Proficient**: These students should understand conversions well and would likely choose B.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level would easily convert and combine units, choosing B.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (confusing units), B=10% (correct but unlikely), C=20% (adding but not converting), D=30% (completely incorrect).
- **Basic**: A=20% (misunderstanding), B=50% (understanding basic conversions), C=20% (near correct but inaccurate), D=10% (less likely to make large errors).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (occasional mistake), B=80% (correct), C=10% (minor error), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (no mistake), B=95% (correct), C=4% (very rare error), D=1% (extremely unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=4% D=1%
