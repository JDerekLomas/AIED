## Step 1: Understand the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for a given math question. The question requires simplifying a product of two fractions.

## 2: Analyze the question
The question is to simplify \( \frac{2}{m^{2}-4 m+3} \times \frac{m-3}{4} \). To simplify, first factor the denominator of the first fraction: \( m^{2} - 4m + 3 = (m-3)(m-1) \). Then, the expression becomes \( \frac{2}{(m-3)(m-1)} \times \frac{m-3}{4} \). Cancelling \( (m-3) \) from numerator and denominator (assuming \( m \neq 3 \) to avoid division by zero), we get \( \frac{2}{4(m-1)} = \frac{1}{2(m-1)} \).

## 3: Identify the correct answer
The simplified form of the given expression is \( \frac{1}{2(m-1)} \), which corresponds to option B.

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and errors
- A common error might be not fully simplifying the expression or not cancelling terms correctly.
- Another error could be misfactoring the quadratic expression.

## 5: Assess the difficulty of the question
The question requires algebraic manipulation, including factoring a quadratic expression and cancelling common factors. It's not extremely complex but does require some algebraic skill.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulation, factoring, and simplifying expressions. They might not correctly factor \( m^{2}-4m+3 \) or might not cancel \( (m-3) \) correctly. Expect a high rate of incorrect answers, possibly with a significant percentage choosing C (not simplifying) or not attempting to simplify at all.

## 7: Assign percentages for below_basic
Given the challenges, below_basic students might have:
- A: 5% (incorrect simplification)
- B: 10% (correct but unlikely to get it without help)
- C: 60% (not simplifying or incorrect manipulation)
- D: 25% (incorrect cancellation or misunderstanding)

## 8: Assign percentages for basic
Basic students would have a better grasp of algebra:
- A: 10% (some might incorrectly simplify)
- B: 40% (correct approach but might make calculation errors)
- C: 30% (struggle with simplification)
- D: 20% (might misinterpret cancellation)

## 9: Assign percentages for proficient
Proficient students should handle this well:
- A: 5% (minor errors)
- B: 80% (correct approach and execution)
- C: 10% (some struggle with cancelling or simplification)
- D: 5% (occasional mistake)

## 10: Assign percentages for advanced
Advanced students should find this straightforward:
- A: 0% (unlikely to make significant errors)
- B: 95% (confident and correct)
- C: 0% (unlikely to not simplify)
- D: 5% (rare mistake)

## 11: Finalize predictions
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=5% B=10% C=60% D=25%
- basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
- proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=5% B=10% C=60% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
