To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

The question requires expanding and simplifying the expression \(4(2x+1) - (5x-9)\). This involves two main steps: distributing (or expanding) and then combining like terms.

## Step 1: Expand the expression
First, distribute the 4 across the terms in the parentheses: \(4(2x+1) = 8x + 4\). Then, distribute the negative sign across the terms in the second set of parentheses: \(-(5x-9) = -5x + 9\). So, the expression becomes \(8x + 4 - 5x + 9\).

## Step 2: Combine like terms
Combine the \(x\) terms: \(8x - 5x = 3x\). Combine the constants: \(4 + 9 = 13\). Therefore, the simplified expression is \(3x + 13\).

## 3: Analyze potential misconceptions and difficulty levels
- A common misconception might be in the distribution or the signs. For example, incorrectly distributing or forgetting to change the sign when subtracting a term.
- The question seems straightforward but let's consider the potential for error:
  - Forgetting to distribute correctly: \(4(2x+1) = 8x + 4\) (correct), but \(-(5x - 9)\) could be incorrectly handled.
  - Incorrectly combining like terms.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with both distribution and combining like terms. They might not correctly distribute the 4 or the negative sign, leading to incorrect combinations. Option A (\(3x - 5\)) could be a result of incorrect distribution and combination, but without clear calculation steps, it's hard to assume direct errors. However, this group might lean towards incorrect options due to fundamental misunderstandings. Let's assume a higher chance of selecting incorrect options: A=30%, B=20%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to get the distribution right but could mess up the combination or signs. The correct answer, B (\(3x + 13\)), should be appealing, but some might make errors leading to A or C. Let's assume: A=15%, B=70%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebra well and are less likely to make simple mistakes. They should easily get \(3x + 13\), so: A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are very confident and accurate in their algebraic manipulations. They would almost certainly choose the correct option: A=1%, B=98%, C=1%, D=0%.

Given these considerations, here is the formatted response:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=1% D=0%
