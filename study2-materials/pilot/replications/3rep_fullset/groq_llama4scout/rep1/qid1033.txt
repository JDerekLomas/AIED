## Step 1: Understand the question and the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for the given question about the cost of one cup of tea.

## 2: Analyze the question
The question provides two scenarios:
1. Chris orders \( 3 \) cups of tea and a cake for \( £3.10 \).
2. Amy orders \( 5 \) cups of tea and a cake for \( £4.50 \).
We need to find the cost of one cup of tea.

## 3: Solve the question to understand the correct approach
Let's denote the cost of one cup of tea as \( T \) and the cost of a cake as \( C \).
From Chris's order: \( 3T + C = 3.10 \)
From Amy's order: \( 5T + C = 4.50 \)

## 4: Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \)
\( (5T + C) - (3T + C) = 4.50 - 3.10 \)
This simplifies to:
\( 2T = 1.40 \)
So, \( T = 0.70 \) or \( 70p \).

## 5: Consider common misconceptions and difficulties
A common misconception might be failing to set up the equations correctly or making a calculation error. However, this question is structured to make it relatively straightforward to set up and solve the equations.

## 6: Assess the difficulty for each ability level
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with setting up equations or solving them, potentially leading to a higher chance of selecting incorrect options.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the need for equations but could make calculation mistakes.
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to set up and solve the equations accurately.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only solve it correctly but also quickly.

## 7: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the correct answer is \( 70p \) (A), and assuming most students can handle the basic algebra:
- **Below_basic**: Might have a hard time, so A=20%, B=20%, C=30%, D=30% (guessing or incorrect calculations).
- **Basic**: Should have a decent chance of getting it right, A=50%, B=20%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Likely to get it right, A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Almost certainly get it right, A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

## 8: Format the prediction
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
