To approach this question, let's first analyze what it's testing: the conversion between fractions, decimals, and percentages. The fraction given is \( \frac{11}{50} \). 

## Step 1: Convert the fraction to a decimal
To convert \( \frac{11}{50} \) to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator: \( \frac{11}{50} = 11 \div 50 = 0.22 \).

## 2: Convert the fraction to a percentage
To convert \( \frac{11}{50} \) to a percentage, we can first convert it to a decimal and then multiply by 100, or directly convert to a percentage: \( \frac{11}{50} \times 100 = 22\% \).

## 3: Evaluate Tom's statement
Tom says \( \frac{11}{50} = 0.11 \). From Step 1, we know \( \frac{11}{50} = 0.22 \), so Tom is incorrect.

## 4: Evaluate Katie's statement
Katie says \( \frac{11}{50} = 22\% \). From Step 2, we confirmed \( \frac{11}{50} = 22\% \), so Katie is correct.

## 5: Determine the correct answer
Given Tom is incorrect and Katie is correct, the correct answer is B: Only Katie.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with conversions between fractions, decimals, and percentages. They might not accurately convert \( \frac{11}{50} \) to a decimal or percentage. There's a high chance they could select A (Only Tom) because they might believe Tom's conversion to decimal is correct due to not performing the calculation correctly, or they might not understand how to convert fractions to percentages properly. 
  - A: 40% (thinking Tom is right, incorrectly)
  - B: 20% (correct, but requires accurate conversion skills)
  - C: 10% (incorrectly thinking both are right)
  - D: 30% (thinking neither is correct, possibly due to confusion)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may make simple calculation errors. They are more likely to realize Tom's mistake but might still struggle with Katie's conversion.
  - A: 20% 
  - B: 60% 
  - C: 10% 
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of conversions and are less likely to make errors in simple conversions like these. They should easily identify Tom's error and confirm Katie's correctness.
  - A: 5% 
  - B: 85% 
  - C: 5% 
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concepts but can also apply them quickly and accurately. They would easily see that Tom is wrong and Katie is right.
  - A: 0% 
  - B: 95% 
  - C: 0% 
  - D: 5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
