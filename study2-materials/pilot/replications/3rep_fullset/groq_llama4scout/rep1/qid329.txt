To approach this question, let's first understand the order of operations and then evaluate the statements made by Tom and Katie.

The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS:
1. Brackets
2. Indices
3. Division
4. Multiplication
5. Addition
6. Subtraction

## Step 1: Evaluate Tom's Statement
Tom says: \( 0.1-0.2 \div 0.3 \equiv 0.1-(0.2 \div 0.3) \)
This statement is essentially claiming that the expression \( 0.1-0.2 \div 0.3 \) is equivalent to \( 0.1-(0.2 \div 0.3) \). According to BIDMAS, division comes before subtraction, so \( 0.2 \div 0.3 \) is evaluated first. The brackets in Tom's expression simply reinforce the order of operations, making it clear that \( 0.2 \div 0.3 \) is to be evaluated before subtracting from \( 0.1 \). Therefore, Tom's statement is correct.

## 2: Evaluate Katie's Statement
Katie says: \( 0.1-0.2 \div 0.3 \equiv 0.2 \div 0.3-0.1 \)
This statement suggests a different order of operations. According to BIDMAS, Katie's expression \( 0.2 \div 0.3-0.1 \) does not follow the same order as \( 0.1-0.2 \div 0.3 \) because the subtraction and division operations are in a different order in each expression. Let's calculate both:
- \( 0.1-0.2 \div 0.3 = 0.1 - (0.2/0.3) = 0.1 - \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.1 - 0.6667 = -0.5667 \)
- \( 0.2 \div 0.3-0.1 = \frac{2}{3} - 0.1 \approx 0.6667 - 0.1 = 0.5667 \)

These are clearly not equal, so Katie's statement is incorrect.

## 3: Analyze Possible Student Responses
- **below_basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations or might not be able to evaluate the expressions correctly. They might mistakenly think both are correct or both are incorrect due to a lack of understanding.
- **basic**: Students at this level should have a basic grasp of BIDMAS. They might struggle with the decimals but should recognize that Tom's statement is correct and Katie's is not, based on the rules of mathematics.
- **proficient**: These students should easily understand and evaluate both expressions, recognizing Tom's statement as correct and Katie's as incorrect.
- **advanced**: Advanced students will not only correctly evaluate the expressions but also understand why the order of operations is crucial, likely finding the question straightforward.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **below_basic**: A=40% (think Tom is correct but don't understand Katie's mistake), B=20% (think Katie is correct), C=10% (think both are correct), D=30% (think neither is correct).
- **basic**: A=60% (understand Tom is correct), B=20% (misunderstand Katie), C=10% (confused), D=10% (see through both).
- **proficient**: A=80% (clearly see Tom is correct), B=5% (unlikely to think Katie is correct), C=5% (very few think both), D=10% (a few might question both due to calculation errors).
- **advanced**: A=90% (no confusion about Tom), B=0% (recognize Katie's error), C=0% (no one thinks both are right), D=10% (only if a calculation error occurs).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
