To approach this question, let's first consider what the equation is and how it's typically solved, then evaluate the potential for misconceptions.

The equation given is \(12d - 3 = 0\). To solve for \(d\), one would typically add 3 to both sides, resulting in \(12d = 3\), and then divide both sides by 12, yielding \(d = \frac{3}{12}\). Simplifying \(\frac{3}{12}\) gives \(d = \frac{1}{4}\).

Misconceptions in solving linear equations often involve mistakes in handling the operations (e.g., incorrectly adding or subtracting, or incorrectly multiplying or dividing). However, this specific question is quite straightforward. 

The correct solution is \(d = \frac{1}{4}\), which corresponds to option D. Let's consider the potential errors:

1. **Adding 3 to both sides but then not dividing correctly**: This could lead to an incorrect fraction or decimal.
2. **Forgetting to divide by 12 or dividing incorrectly**: This could result in various incorrect answers.

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle significantly with algebraic manipulation. They might not even attempt to solve the equation or could make significant mistakes. Option A (\(d = -\frac{1}{4}\)), C (\(d = -4\)), and incorrect calculations leading to B (\(d = 4\)) could be tempting if they misunderstand the operations. However, given the simplicity of adding 3 and then dividing by 12, a significant portion might still stumble upon the correct answer or make obvious mistakes. Let's assume: A=20% (incorrect negative), B=30% (incorrect large positive), C=20% (incorrect large negative), D=30% (correct or by chance).

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebra. They are likely to solve the equation but might make careless mistakes. Let's assume: A=5% (might see a negative and mistakenly keep it), B=10% (could miscalculate division), C=5% (unlikely but possible if they mess up signs), D=80% (should easily solve it).

- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebra and less likely to make mistakes. Let's assume: A=1% (very unlikely), B=2% (miscalculation), C=1% (unlikely), D=96% (easily solve it).

- **Advanced**: For these students, solving this equation is straightforward. Let's assume: A=0% (extremely unlikely), B=0% (unlikely), C=0% (unlikely), D=100% (no issue solving).

So, considering typical student performance and common misconceptions:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
proficient: A=1% B=2% C=1% D=96%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
