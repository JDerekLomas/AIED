To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the problem and the common misconceptions or challenges students might face.

The question requires students to find the cost of one bottle of water when given the cost of eight bottles. This is a straightforward division problem. 

## Step 1: Understand the Problem
The cost of eight bottles of water is \( £3.60 \). To find the cost of one bottle, students need to divide \( £3.60 \) by 8.

## 2: Identify Potential Challenges
- A common challenge could be performing the division correctly, especially if students are not confident with dividing decimals or if they misunderstand the operation (e.g., multiplying instead of dividing).
- Another challenge might be converting the result into a more understandable format, such as pence, if the division results in a decimal.

## 3: Analyze the Options
- A: \( £28.80 \) - This is an implausibly high price for one bottle, suggesting a significant calculation error.
- B: \( 30p \) - This is \( £0.30 \), which seems too low given the cost of eight bottles.
- C: \( 45p \) - This is \( £0.45 \), which could be a plausible answer if the calculation is correct.
- D: \( £3.53 \) - This suggests a very small reduction from \( £3.60 \) for 7 bottles, which is not mathematically sound.

## 4: Perform the Calculation
To find the cost of one bottle: \( £3.60 \div 8 = £0.45 \).

## 5: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the division, possibly leading to incorrect answers. They might choose A because they mistakenly multiply \( £3.60 \) by 8 (though this seems less likely given the obvious increase), or they might choose B or D due to incorrect division or rounding. Given their likely struggles, A=20% (for those who miscalculate significantly), B=30% (a simple, low estimate), C=20% (those who might get it right or estimate closely), D=30% (for those who make a small adjustment error).
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to perform the division with some accuracy. They might still make errors but are more likely to choose C. So, A=5%, B=10%, C=75%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily perform the division and choose C. Thus, A=1%, B=2%, C=95%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: These students will almost certainly choose C without any confusion. Hence, A=0%, B=0%, C=99%, D=1%.

The best answer is C. 

Below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=75% D=10%
proficient: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=99% D=1%
