To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given equation \(-5 = p + 10\), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

## Step 1: Understanding the Equation
The equation given is \(-5 = p + 10\). To solve for \(p\), students need to isolate \(p\) on one side of the equation. This typically involves subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation.

## 2: Solving the Equation
Subtract 10 from both sides:
\(-5 - 10 = p + 10 - 10\),
which simplifies to
\(-15 = p\).

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions or Errors
A common error in solving equations like this is not performing the same operation on both sides of the equation or making a mistake with the signs. For example, students might add 10 instead of subtract, or they might forget to change the sign when moving a number to the other side.

## 4: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(p = 5\). This would be incorrect because it suggests \(p + 10 = -5\) implies \(p = 5\), which is not true.
- Option B: \(p = -5\). This might seem plausible to some students who incorrectly think that \(p + 10 = -5\) means \(p = -5\), but it doesn't account for the \(+10\).
- Option C: \(p = -15\). This is the correct solution.
- Option D: \(p = 15\). This is clearly incorrect as it suggests a positive solution which doesn't fit the equation.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not correctly subtract 10 from -5 or might add instead of subtract. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers.
  - A: 20% (random guess)
  - B: 30% (thinking \(p = -5\) could work if they ignore \(+10\))
  - C: 20% (correct but might be a lucky guess)
  - D: 30% (another random guess)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple arithmetic mistakes.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 20%
  - C: 60% (most should get it right with some guidance)
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient**: These students understand algebra well and can solve simple equations accurately.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 85%
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are comfortable with algebra and can solve equations with ease.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 0%
  - C: 95%
  - D: 5% (possibly due to a calculator error or very careless mistake)

## 6: Final Prediction
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
