To solve this, let's consider the probability of at least one ball being red when Kate picks out two balls at the same time from a cup containing 5 red balls and 4 yellow balls.

## Step 1: Calculate the total number of balls
There are \(5 + 4 = 9\) balls in total.

## 2: Calculate the total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 9
The total number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 9 without regard to order (since they are picked at the same time) is given by the combination formula \(C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\), where \(n = 9\) and \(k = 2\).
So, \(C(9, 2) = \frac{9!}{2!(9-2)!} = \frac{9 \times 8}{2 \times 1} = 36\).

## 3: Calculate the number of ways to pick 2 balls such that at least one is red
It's easier to calculate the probability that neither ball is red (i.e., both are yellow) and subtract that from 1.
The number of ways to pick 2 yellow balls out of 4 is \(C(4, 2) = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6\).

## 4: Calculate the probability that both balls are yellow
The probability that both balls are yellow is \(\frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}\).

## 5: Calculate the probability that at least one ball is red
The probability that at least one ball is red is \(1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}\).

## 6: Convert the probability to a fraction out of 72 for comparison with the given options
\(\frac{5}{6} = \frac{5 \times 12}{6 \times 12} = \frac{60}{72}\).

## 7: Analyzing Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with combinations and calculating probabilities. They might not correctly calculate the total number of outcomes or the number of favorable outcomes. They could mistakenly choose B or D, not understanding how to calculate probabilities or mistakenly calculating the probability of picking two red balls or two yellow balls directly. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 30\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(D = 20\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic probability concepts but might make calculation errors. They are likely to understand the concept of combinations but might miscalculate. They might lean towards C if they understand the concept but struggle with calculations. \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 60\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students understand probability concepts well and can calculate them accurately. They would likely choose C as it's the correct answer. \(A = 80\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 5\%\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can also apply advanced concepts. They would accurately calculate the probability and choose A (which matches our calculation) as the correct representation of \(\frac{5}{6}\). \(A = 90\%\), \(B = 2\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 3\%\).

The best answer is C. 

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
