## Step 1: Understand the question and the equation given
The equation provided is \(y = x^2 + 4\), and we need to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = -6\). This is a straightforward substitution task.

## 2: Calculate the value of \(y\) when \(x = -6\)
To find \(y\), we substitute \(x = -6\) into the equation: \(y = (-6)^2 + 4 = 36 + 4 = 40\).

## 3: Analyze the potential misconceptions or errors
The question is designed to test if students can correctly substitute a negative value into an equation and calculate the result, specifically handling the square of a negative number correctly. A common misconception might involve not squaring the negative number correctly or forgetting to add 4.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with substituting \(x = -6\) into the equation or with handling the negative sign when squaring. They might also forget to add 4. So, incorrect calculations could lead to various wrong answers, but given the simplicity of the calculation, some might still arrive at the correct answer through luck or basic understanding.

- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding of algebra and can likely substitute \(x\) and calculate \(y\), but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. For example, they might calculate \((-6)^2\) as \(36\) but then incorrectly add or subtract 4, or they might incorrectly calculate \((-6)^2 + 4\).

- **Proficient:** These students are likely to understand the equation and substitute \(x = -6\) correctly. They should arrive at \(y = 40\) without issue, but a small percentage might make a careless mistake.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and are less likely to make mistakes in simple substitutions and calculations.

## 5: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
Given the calculation \(y = 40\), and considering common errors:
- **Below Basic:** A=60% (correct, through luck or basic understanding), B=20% (thinking \(y = 4\) when \(x = 0\) or similar simple mistake), C=5% (incorrect calculation), D=15% (other incorrect calculations).
- **Basic:** A=80% (correct calculation), B=10% (simple mistake), C=5% (thinking \(y = x^2 - 24\)), D=5% (other mistakes).
- **Proficient:** A=95% (correct), B=3% (careless mistake), C=1% (rare mistake), D=1% (rare mistake).
- **Advanced:** A=99% (correct), B=0.5% (very unlikely mistake), C=0.25% (extremely rare mistake), D=0.25% (extremely rare mistake).

The best answer is A.
