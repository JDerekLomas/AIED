## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the length of one side of a square given its area is \( 64 \mathrm{~mm}^{2} \). To find the side length, we take the square root of the area.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Answer
The area of a square is given by \( \text{side}^2 = \text{area} \). Thus, the side length is \( \sqrt{64} = 8 \) mm. This means the correct answer is C) \( 8 \mathrm{~mm} \).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be confusing the operations or misinterpreting the relationship between area and side length. For example, some might think to add or multiply the area by something to get the side length, or they might mistakenly think the side length is the area squared.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic mathematical operations or understanding the concept of area and side length. They might choose an answer that seems too easy or too hard without calculation, or they might not understand the square root operation. Given the options, A (\( 16 \mathrm{~mm} \)) could be a guess if they mistakenly think the side length is directly proportional to the area, B (\( 32 \mathrm{~mm} \)) could be a result of adding or multiplying incorrectly, and D (\( 4096 \mathrm{~mm} \)) seems highly unlikely as it implies \( 64^2 \) or \( 64 \times 64 \), which is not a common error. So, below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic math concepts but might make careless mistakes. They should know that to find the side length, you take the square root of the area. For \( 64 \mathrm{~mm}^{2} \), \( \sqrt{64} = 8 \), so C) \( 8 \mathrm{~mm} \) is correct. However, they might confuse operations: A=10% (thinking \( 8 \times 2 \)), B=10% (possibly \( 8 \times 4 \) with incorrect factor), C=70% (correct), D=10%.

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept well and are less likely to make errors in calculation. They know \( \sqrt{64} = 8 \), so they should choose C) \( 8 \mathrm{~mm} \) confidently. Thus, proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the math concepts but also might be quicker to recognize and dismiss incorrect options. They should all choose C) \( 8 \mathrm{~mm} \). So, advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%.

## 5: Compiling Predictions
Based on the analysis:

- below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
- basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
