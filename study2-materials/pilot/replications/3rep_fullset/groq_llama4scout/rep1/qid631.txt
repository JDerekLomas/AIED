To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Jo and Paul and evaluate their validity.

## Step 1: Evaluate Jo's Statement
Jo says there is no value of \( m \) that means \( 3^{m} \) is even. To assess this, we need to consider the properties of powers of 3. Since 3 is an odd number, any power of 3 will also be odd (\( 3^{1} = 3 \), \( 3^{2} = 9 \), \( 3^{3} = 27 \), etc.). This is because the product of odd numbers is always odd. Therefore, Jo is correct.

## 2: Evaluate Paul's Statement
Paul says there is no value of \( n \) that means \( 4^{n} \) ends in \( 0 \). Let's examine powers of 4: \( 4^{1} = 4 \), \( 4^{2} = 16 \), \( 4^{3} = 64 \), \( 4^{4} = 256 \), etc. It's noticeable that none of these end in 0. This is because 4 raised to any power will always result in a number that ends in 4, 6, or a pattern that doesn't include 0, due to the multiplication properties of 4. Specifically, \( 4^{n} \) will always end in 4 or 6 (for \( n = 1 \) it ends in 4, for \( n = 2 \) it ends in 6, and this pattern repeats for higher powers). Therefore, Paul is also correct.

## 3: Consider Student Understanding
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding powers and their properties. They might not fully grasp why \( 3^{m} \) is always odd or why \( 4^{n} \) doesn't end in 0. They could mistakenly think there are exceptions or not fully understand the patterns. So, they might choose D (Neither is correct) because they don't understand the reasoning behind Jo and Paul's statements. A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding of mathematical operations but might not deeply understand the patterns of powers. They might agree with Jo but not fully consider Paul's statement or vice versa. There's a chance they could recognize both statements are correct but might also be confused. So, A=15% B=15% C=40% D=30%
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should understand the properties of odd and even numbers and the patterns of powers. They should recognize that \( 3^{m} \) is always odd and \( 4^{n} \) never ends in 0. Therefore, they should find both Jo and Paul correct. A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the properties but can also reason about them abstractly. They will easily see that Jo and Paul are both correct based on the properties of exponents and number patterns. A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=40% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
