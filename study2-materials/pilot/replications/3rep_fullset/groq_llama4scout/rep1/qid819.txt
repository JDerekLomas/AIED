To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \(6 - (-8) =\), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question tests the understanding of subtracting a negative number, which is equivalent to adding a positive number. The correct calculation is \(6 - (-8) = 6 + 8 = 14\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception is that subtracting a negative number results in a negative answer or that the operation is equivalent to subtracting a positive number without changing the sign of the second term. This could lead students to calculate \(6 - 8 = -2\) or simply not adjust the sign of the second term correctly.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(14\) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \(-14\) could be chosen by students who mistakenly think \(6 - (-8)\) becomes \(-6 - 8\) or through another incorrect operation.
- Option C: \(2\) does not directly relate to a common error in this operation.
- Option D: \(-2\) might be chosen by students who incorrectly apply the operation as \(6 + (-8) = -2\) or similar misconceptions.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and the concept of negative numbers. They might choose B, C, or D due to lack of understanding. Option A seems unlikely.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic operations but might still struggle with negative numbers. They might incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the concept, leading to choices like B, C, or D.
- **Proficient:** These students understand basic operations with positive and negative numbers. The correct answer, A, should be more recognizable, but some might still make errors leading to B or D.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to handle operations with negative numbers confidently and accurately. However, the phrasing of the question might not necessarily weed out common misconceptions for all.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question once the rule for subtracting a negative is understood, we estimate:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (maybe get it right by chance), B=30%, C=20%, D=30%
- **Basic:** A=60%, B=20%, C=5%, D=15%
- **Proficient:** A=85%, B=10%, C=2%, D=3%
- **Advanced:** A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%

The best answer is A. 

The response format:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
