To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question involves finding the ratio of how much of a film James and Cameron have watched to how much they have yet to see, given that they paused it with one seventh left to watch. This implies they have watched \( \frac{6}{7} \) of the film and have \( \frac{1}{7} \) left to watch.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The ratio of how much they have watched to how much they have yet to see can be calculated directly from the information given. They have watched \( \frac{6}{7} \) of the film and have \( \frac{1}{7} \) left. So, the ratio of watched to yet to see is \( \frac{6}{7} : \frac{1}{7} \) or simply \( 6:1 \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the parts of the film watched and left to watch or inverting the ratio. However, the question seems straightforward: if \( \frac{1}{7} \) is left, then \( \frac{6}{7} \) has been watched. The ratio of watched to left is thus directly related to the fraction of the film that has been watched versus the fraction left.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( 1:7 \) suggests they have watched \( \frac{1}{7} \) and have \( \frac{7}{7} \) left, which is incorrect.
- B: \( 7:1 \) suggests they have watched \( \frac{7}{7} \) and have \( \frac{1}{7} \) left, which is also incorrect as it inverts the "watched" and "left" portions.
- C: \( 6:1 \) correctly represents the \( \frac{6}{7} \) watched to \( \frac{1}{7} \) left ratio.
- D: \( 1:6 \) suggests they have watched \( \frac{1}{7} \) and have \( \frac{6}{7} \) left, which is incorrect.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with ratios and fractions. They could easily confuse the fractions or misinterpret the question. Option A (\( 1:7 \)) might seem plausible if they think about the "1" part left directly, and option B (\( 7:1 \)) could be chosen if they mistakenly think about the whole being 7 parts and they've watched all but 1 part incorrectly. A=30%, B=30%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic fractions and ratios but might make simple errors. They are likely to understand the concept of \( \frac{6}{7} \) watched and \( \frac{1}{7} \) left but could easily pick the wrong ratio. A=15%, B=15%, C=60%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with fractions and ratios. They should easily identify the correct ratio. A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong understanding of mathematical concepts and should have no trouble. A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
