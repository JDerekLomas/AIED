To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about the mathematical instrument used to construct circles, let's analyze the question and the options provided.

The question is straightforward and tests basic knowledge of mathematical instruments. The correct answer is B) Compass, as a compass is the primary tool used in geometry to construct circles and arcs.

- **Callipers (A)** are used to measure the distance between two points or the diameter of a circle or object, not to construct circles.
- **Compass (B)** is the correct tool for constructing circles and arcs.
- **Protractor (C)** is used to measure angles, not to construct circles.
- **Slide rule (D)** is a tool used for multiplication, division, and other calculations, not for constructing geometric shapes.

Given the simplicity of the question and the clarity of the correct answer, even students at lower ability levels should be familiar with the basic tools used in mathematics and geometry.

## Predictions by Ability Level:

### below_basic
At this level, students may have limited exposure to or understanding of specific mathematical tools beyond the very basics.
- A=20% (some might mistakenly think callipers are used for drawing)
- B=50% (basic knowledge, but might be mixed with other common tools)
- C=20% (might confuse with protractor for angle measurements)
- D=10% (less likely to consider slide rule for geometric constructions)

### basic
Students at this level have a foundational understanding of mathematical concepts and tools.
- A=10% (less likely to choose callipers for circle construction)
- B=70% (recognize compass as the tool for constructing circles)
- C=15% (some confusion with protractor)
- D=5% (unlikely to choose slide rule)

### proficient
Proficient students have a solid grasp of mathematical concepts and are less likely to make mistakes on basic tool identification.
- A=5% (very few would choose callipers)
- B=85% (strong understanding that compass is used for circles)
- C=5% (minimal confusion with protractor)
- D=5% (unlikely to choose slide rule)

### advanced
Advanced students have a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and tools, making errors on this question highly unlikely.
- A=0% (no one would choose callipers for constructing circles)
- B=95% (confidently choose compass)
- C=0% (no confusion with protractor)
- D=5% (extremely unlikely to choose slide rule, but could consider very exceptional cases of confusion)

Given the nature of the question and typical student knowledge:
below_basic: A=20% B=50% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
