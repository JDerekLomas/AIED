## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential misconception
The question requires finding the height of a rectangle given the coordinates of two opposite corners: (-4,7) and (2,-12). The height of the rectangle can be determined by finding the difference in the y-coordinates of these two points.

## 2: Calculate the correct height of the rectangle
To find the height, we calculate the absolute difference between the y-coordinates: \(|7 - (-12)| = |7 + 12| = 19\). This means the correct answer is D) \(19\).

## 3: Consider the common misconceptions and difficulties
A common misconception might involve incorrectly calculating the difference or not accounting for the absolute value (i.e., getting a negative height). Another potential error could be misreading the coordinates or the diagram.

## 4: Assess the difficulty for students at different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic coordinate geometry, possibly misinterpreting the coordinates or not understanding how to calculate the difference in y-coordinates correctly. They might choose A, B, or C due to calculation errors.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should have a grasp of coordinate geometry basics but might still make simple arithmetic errors or misunderstand the concept of "height" in this context. They are likely to attempt the calculation but might choose A, B, or C if they make a mistake.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should easily understand the concept and calculate the height correctly. However, some might still be tricked by common misconceptions or make careless errors, though this is less likely. They are more likely to choose D) \(19\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should have a strong understanding of coordinate geometry and be able to apply it accurately. They are likely to choose D) \(19\) without hesitation.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at different ability levels
Given the straightforward nature of the question once understood, and assuming most students can read the coordinates and perform basic arithmetic:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55% (Many struggle, but some guess or partially understand)
- **Basic**: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80% (Most attempt to calculate and succeed)
- **Proficient**: A=2% B=1% C=2% D=95% (Very few make errors)
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100% (Understand and calculate correctly)

The best answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
proficient: A=2% B=1% C=2% D=95%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
