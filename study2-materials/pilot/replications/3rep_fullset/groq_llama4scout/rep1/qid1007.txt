## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question provides a ratio of adults to children at a party as \(1:4\) and states there are \(20\) adults. It asks for the number of children.

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
The misconception often tested in ratio problems is misunderstanding how ratios relate to actual numbers. For example, some students might think the ratio \(1:4\) means there is \(1\) adult for every \(4\) children, not realizing the ratio compares adults to children directly.

## 3: Analyzing the Ratio
Given the ratio \(1:4\), for every \(1\) adult, there are \(4\) children. If there are \(20\) adults, then the number of children can be found by multiplying the number of adults by \(4\), since \(20\) adults represent \(20\) "units" of the ratio, and each unit corresponds to \(4\) children.

## 4: Calculating the Number of Children
To find the number of children: \(20 \times 4 = 80\).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with ratios and proportional reasoning. They might incorrectly apply the ratio or not understand it. Option C (80) is the correct answer, but these students might choose options that seem simpler or more direct, like A (4) or D (20), because they might not perform the multiplication correctly or understand the ratio application. B (5) seems unlikely as it doesn't directly relate to simple ratio misinterpretations. So, below_basic: A=20% B=5% C=60% D=15%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of ratios and can apply them in straightforward situations. They are likely to get the correct answer, C (80), but some might make errors due to misreading the ratio or question. So, basic: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of ratios and proportional relationships. They should easily calculate the correct answer, C (80), with minimal errors. So, proficient: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand ratios but are also adept at applying them in various contexts. They will almost certainly choose the correct answer, C (80). So, advanced: A=0% B=0% C=99% D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=5% C=60% D=15%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=99% D=1%
