To approach this question, let's consider the elements that could influence students' understanding and potential misconceptions regarding lines of symmetry.

## Step 1: Understanding Lines of Symmetry
A line of symmetry is an imaginary line that divides a shape into two identical parts, where one part is a mirror image of the other. For a rectangle, there are 2 lines of symmetry: one vertical through the middle and one horizontal through the middle.

## 2: Analyzing the Given Shape
The shape described is a rectangle divided into 3 equal horizontal sections, with the middle section being white and the other two being blue. Additionally, there are five blue stars in the white section, arranged like the dots on a dice. The key here is to determine if the arrangement of colors and the stars affects the lines of symmetry.

## 3: Considering the Impact of the Stars
The stars are arranged in the same formation as the dots on a dice and are all in the same orientation with one point pointing directly upwards. This specific arrangement does not inherently create asymmetry in the rectangle itself since the stars are confined to the central white section. However, the question is whether this arrangement disrupts the lines of symmetry of the rectangle.

## 4: Determining Lines of Symmetry
The rectangle itself has 2 lines of symmetry. The addition of the white and blue sections does not change this, as these sections are symmetrically arranged. The critical point is whether the stars disrupt this symmetry. Given that the stars are symmetrically arranged within the white section (as per the dice pattern), they do not disrupt the horizontal line of symmetry. However, the vertical line of symmetry is maintained because the stars' arrangement does not favor one side over the other.

## 5: Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to consider the stars as disrupting both lines of symmetry or to overlook the symmetry of the stars' arrangement. However, the dice-like pattern of the stars is symmetric about both a horizontal and a vertical axis through its center.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding what constitutes a line of symmetry or might not recognize the symmetry of the dice pattern. They might be drawn to option A (0 lines of symmetry) due to a lack of understanding of symmetry or option D (4 lines of symmetry) if they mistakenly see more symmetry than exists.
- **Basic:** Students here might recognize the rectangle's symmetry but could be unsure about the impact of the stars. They might lean towards B (1 line of symmetry) if they consider only the horizontal symmetry or C (2 lines of symmetry) if they correctly identify both.
- **Proficient:** These students should understand the concept of lines of symmetry well and recognize that the stars do not disrupt the rectangle's symmetry. They are likely to choose C (2 lines of symmetry).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will not only correctly identify the lines of symmetry but also understand why the stars do not affect the count. They will also choose C (2 lines of symmetry), confident in their understanding.

## 7: Estimated Percentages
Given the above considerations:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (misunderstanding symmetry), B=20% (partial understanding), C=40% (correct but possibly by chance), D=10% (overestimating symmetry).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=35%, C=45%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=5%, C=90%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=35% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
