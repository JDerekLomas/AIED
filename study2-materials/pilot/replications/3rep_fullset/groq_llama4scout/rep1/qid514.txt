To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls it presents, especially considering common misconceptions related to calculating the area of a triangle.

The formula for the area of a triangle when the base and the perpendicular height are known is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\). In this case, the base of the triangle is 40cm, and the perpendicular height is 15cm. Therefore, the correct calculation for the area is \(\frac{40 \times 15}{2}\), which corresponds to option C.

## Step 1: Identify the Correct Answer
The correct formula for the area of the triangle given is \( \frac{40 \times 15}{2} \), which is option C. This is a straightforward calculation once the relevant measurements are identified.

## 2: Analyze Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve using the wrong measurements for the calculation. For instance, students might mistakenly use the slant height (25cm) instead of the perpendicular height (15cm) because the slant height is often used in calculations related to right-angled triangles (e.g., Pythagoras' theorem), but not for the area of a triangle when the base and height are given.

## 3: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to identify the correct measurements for the area calculation. They might confuse the base and height or use the slant height incorrectly. Option A (\( \frac{40 \times 25}{2} \)) uses the base and the slant height, which could be a common error. Option C is the correct answer, but these students might not reach it.
  - A: 30%
  - B: 10% (unlikely, as it introduces an extra unnecessary factor)
  - C: 40%
  - D: 20%

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp of basic formulas but might still make careless mistakes. They are more likely to recognize the correct formula but might be tempted by option A due to the confusion between height and slant height.
  - A: 20%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 70%
  - D: 5%

- **Proficient**: These students are familiar with the area formula and are less likely to make straightforward errors. They should easily identify the correct option.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 2%
  - C: 92%
  - D: 1%

- **Advanced**: Advanced students are highly unlikely to make errors related to basic formulas. They should all choose the correct option.
  - A: 1%
  - B: 0%
  - C: 99%
  - D: 0%
