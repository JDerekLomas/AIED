To approach this question, let's analyze the algebraic expression and the common misconceptions students might have.

The expression given is "\( m \) multiplied by \( n \), then add \( 5 \)". Using algebraic convention, this should be translated to \( mn + 5 \), because "multiplied by" implies the operation between \( m \) and \( n \) happens first, and then \( 5 \) is added.

## Step 1: Identify the correct expression
The correct way to write "\( m \) multiplied by \( n \), then add \( 5 \)" algebraically is \( mn + 5 \).

## 2: Analyze each option
- A: \( m(n+5) \) implies \( m \) multiplied by \( n + 5 \), which is not what the question states.
- B: \( m \times n + 5 \) implies \( m \) multiplied by \( n \), then add \( 5 \), which matches the question but uses \( \times \) for multiplication.
- C: \( mn + 5 \) is the correct algebraic expression without using \( \times \) for multiplication.
- D: \( 5mn \) implies \( 5 \) multiplied by \( m \) and \( n \), which is not what the question states.

## 3: Consider common student misconceptions
A common misconception is the incorrect application of order of operations or misunderstanding the algebraic notation. Students might get confused about how to represent "then add" in algebraic form.

## 4: Assess the difficulty level
For below_basic and basic students, the question might be confusing because they might not be familiar with algebraic conventions or might misinterpret the order of operations. For proficient and advanced students, this should be straightforward.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic notation. They might choose B because it directly reflects the operation sequence given but uses \( \times \), or they might mistakenly choose D because it involves all variables and a constant. A and C are less likely because they require understanding of implied multiplication. 
  - A=20%, B=40%, C=20%, D=20%
- **Basic**: Students here have a bit more understanding but might still struggle with nuances of algebraic expressions. They are more likely to choose B or C because they start to understand multiplication and addition but might not consistently apply algebraic conventions.
  - A=15%, B=50%, C=25%, D=10%
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should understand algebraic conventions well. They are likely to choose C because it correctly represents the expression without \( \times \) and follows algebraic notation rules.
  - A=5%, B=30%, C=60%, D=5%
- **Advanced**: These students are familiar with algebraic expressions and conventions. They will likely choose C without hesitation.
  - A=0%, B=10%, C=90%, D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=50% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=30% C=60% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=10% C=90% D=0%
