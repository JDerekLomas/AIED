To approach this question, let's first understand what's being asked. The question presents a number line from 0% to 100% with 20% labelled as 90. There's a star positioned above 100%, and we need to determine what number should replace the star, implying the scale is not linear in terms of percentage but rather in the numbers associated with percentages.

## Step 1: Determine the Scale Factor
First, we find out how much 1% represents in terms of the number scale provided. Since 20% corresponds to 90, we divide 90 by 20 to find out how much 1% represents: \(90 / 20 = 4.5\). This means 1% equals 4.5 units on the scale.

## 2: Calculate the Value for 100%
To find the value that corresponds to 100%, we multiply 100 by the scale factor (4.5): \(100 \times 4.5 = 450\).

## 3: Analyze the Options with Respect to the Calculation
Given the calculation, the correct answer is \(450\), which directly corresponds to option A.

## 4: Consider Misconceptions and Errors
A common misconception might involve misunderstanding the scale or incorrectly calculating the value for 100%. For instance, some might mistakenly think the relationship is directly proportional in a simpler manner or miscalculate the scale factor.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of scaling and percentages. They might choose an option that seems "reasonable" or makes a simple mistake in calculation, such as using 20% = 90 to guess other percentages without scaling properly. Option C (70) and D (18) might seem plausible for a quick, incorrect estimation. \( A=20\% B=10\% C=40\% D=30\% \)
- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp of percentages and scaling but might still make calculation errors. They are more likely to attempt calculations but could end up with incorrect options due to miscalculation. \( A=60\% B=20\% C=10\% D=10\% \)
- **Proficient**: These students understand percentages and scaling well. They are likely to calculate the correct answer but might double-check their work. \( A=80\% B=10\% C=5\% D=5\% \)
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but are also likely to solve the problem efficiently and accurately, recognizing the scale factor immediately. \( A=90\% B=5\% C=2\% D=3\% \)

The best answer is A. 

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
