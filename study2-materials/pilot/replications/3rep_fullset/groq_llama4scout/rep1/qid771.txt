To approach this question, let's first understand the relationship between the time taken to complete a job \( (t) \) and the number of people working on it \( (p) \). Generally, as the number of people working on a job increases, the time taken to complete the job decreases, but not in a directly proportional manner. If \( p \) people can complete a job in \( t \) hours, then \( 1 \) person can complete the job in \( pt \) hours. This implies that \( t \) is inversely proportional to \( p \), i.e., \( t = \frac{k}{p} \) where \( k \) is a constant.

## Step 1: Understanding the Relationship
The relationship between \( t \) and \( p \) is inversely proportional. This means as \( p \) increases, \( t \) decreases, and the graph should reflect this inverse relationship.

## 2: Analyzing the Graph Options
- Option A: A straight line from bottom left to top right, starting from above the origin. This suggests a direct relationship rather than an inverse one.
- Option B: A straight line from top left to bottom right, starting from above the origin. This could suggest an inverse relationship but is not typical for inverse proportionality.
- Option C: A curved line from top left rapidly descending as it moves right before slowing down and levelling out. This represents an inverse relationship where as \( p \) increases, \( t \) decreases rapidly at first and then more slowly, which aligns with \( t = \frac{k}{p} \).
- Option D: A straight line from bottom left to top right, starting from the origin. This represents a direct proportionality.

## 3: Identifying the Correct Relationship
The correct relationship for \( t \) and \( p \) being inversely proportional is best represented by Option C, as it shows \( t \) decreasing as \( p \) increases, with the rate of decrease slowing down. This matches the expectation for inverse proportionality.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle to understand the concept of inverse proportionality. They might choose Option A or D because they represent simple, direct relationships that are easy to understand. Option B might also be chosen due to its linear nature, which could be mistaken for an inverse relationship. Option C=20%, A=30%, B=20%, D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding of relationships but might not fully grasp inverse proportionality. They may still be tempted by direct relationships but are more likely to recognize the inverse relationship. Option C=40%, A=25%, B=20%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand inverse proportionality and are likely to choose Option C. They might still consider Option B due to its line but are less likely to choose direct relationships. Option C=80%, A=5%, B=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong understanding of mathematical relationships and are very likely to choose Option C without confusion. Option C=95%, A=0%, B=2%, D=3%.

## 5: Summarizing Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=25% B=20% C=40% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=2% C=95% D=3%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=95% D=3%
