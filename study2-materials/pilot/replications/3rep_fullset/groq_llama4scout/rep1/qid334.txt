To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question provides a probability of \( \frac{1}{5} \) and asks students to place this value on a probability scale. The probability scale typically ranges from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain). The fraction \( \frac{1}{5} \) is equivalent to 0.2, which is less than 0.5, indicating a probability that is less likely than not.

## Step 1: Understanding the Probability Scale
The probability scale usually starts at 0 (or 0%) for an impossible event and ends at 1 (or 100%) for a certain event. A probability of \( \frac{1}{5} \) or 0.2 falls between 0 and 0.5.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
Some students might confuse the probability with a percentage or not understand how to convert a fraction to a decimal or its position on a scale from 0 to 1. However, \( \frac{1}{5} \) is a simple fraction that many students can convert to 0.2.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
Without seeing the actual scale but given typical representations:
- Option A usually represents a low probability (close to 0).
- Option B might represent a moderate low probability.
- Option C could represent a moderate probability (around 0.5).
- Option D would represent a high probability (close to 1).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with converting \( \frac{1}{5} \) to a decimal or understanding its place on the scale. They might incorrectly place it towards the higher end due to not fully understanding fractions and decimals. So, A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** Basic level students should be able to convert \( \frac{1}{5} \) to 0.2. They might still make errors due to the scale not being explicitly provided but should generally understand it's on the lower side. So, A=60%, B=25%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are expected to accurately convert \( \frac{1}{5} \) to 0.2 and understand its position. They should mostly choose the correct option representing a low probability. So, A=80%, B=15%, C=4%, D=1%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to not only accurately convert \( \frac{1}{5} \) but also quickly understand its position on the scale. They would predominantly choose the correct option. So, A=95%, B=4%, C=1%, D=0%.

Given these considerations and in the required format:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
