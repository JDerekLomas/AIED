## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it might test.
The question presents a speed-time graph and asks for the best estimate of the distance travelled between 6 and 8 seconds. The graph shows that at 6 seconds, the car is travelling at 8 m/s, and at 8 seconds, it is travelling at 15 m/s. A common misconception could be assuming the distance travelled is the average speed multiplied by the time, without properly considering the shape of the graph.

## 2: Determine the correct method to solve the problem.
To estimate the distance travelled between 6 and 8 seconds, one should ideally use the area under the speed-time graph between these two points. However, without the exact graph provided, we assume a linear increase in speed for simplicity. The average speed between 6 and 8 seconds can be calculated as \( \frac{8 + 15}{2} = 11.5 \) m/s. The distance travelled in 2 seconds at this average speed is \( 11.5 \times 2 = 23 \) meters.

## 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on the calculation.
Given the calculation, the closest answer to 23 meters is \( 24 m \) (option C). Let's assess the likelihood of students choosing each option based on their ability levels.

## 4: Assess student responses by ability level.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand the concept of using average speed or area under the graph. They might incorrectly calculate or choose an answer without proper reasoning. Option A (30 m) and D (66 m) seem too high or unrelated to a simple calculation, but without a clear understanding, they might pick any. Option B (11 m) seems too low. Given the lack of understanding, they might lean towards A or D due to miscalculation or incorrect application of formulas.

- **Basic:** Students here might have a grasp of basic concepts but could struggle with applying them to estimate distances from graphs. They might approximate or use a simple formula. They could estimate the average speed and distance but might not calculate it precisely, making C (24 m) a plausible choice if they do it roughly.

- **Proficient:** These students should understand the concept of average speed and area under the curve. They would likely calculate the average speed (11.5 m/s) and then the distance (23 meters), making C (24 m) the most attractive option.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students would likely have a sophisticated understanding and could calculate precisely or use the trapezoidal rule for a more accurate estimate. They would still find C (24 m) to be the closest estimate.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option.
Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (overestimation), B=10% (underestimation), C=30% (closest but requires some understanding), D=20% (possibly from miscalculation).
- **Basic:** A=20%, B=15%, C=55%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=5%, B=0%, C=90%, D=5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=55% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%
