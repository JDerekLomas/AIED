To approach this question, let's first analyze the algebraic manipulation involved and then consider the potential pitfalls or ease with which students at different levels might solve it.

The equation given is \(\frac{5x}{3} - 1 = -2.4\).

## Step 1: Solve the equation to verify the steps.
First, let's add 1 to both sides to isolate the fraction: \(\frac{5x}{3} = -2.4 + 1\).
This simplifies to: \(\frac{5x}{3} = -1.4\).

## 2: Verify Tom's step.
Tom suggests: \(5x - 3 = -7.2\).
To check if this is a valid step from the original equation, let's see if it aligns with standard algebraic manipulations:
- Multiply both sides of the original equation by 3 to clear the fraction: \(5x - 3 = -2.4 \times 3\).
- This gives: \(5x - 3 = -7.2\), which matches Tom's suggestion.

## 3: Verify Katie's step.
Katie suggests: \(\frac{5x}{3} = -3.4\).
Let's compare this with our manipulation in Step 1: \(\frac{5x}{3} = -1.4\).
Katie's step does not match the correct manipulation.

## 4: Analyze the potential for student errors.
- The question tests the understanding of algebraic manipulations, specifically adding to or multiplying both sides of an equation by a constant.
- Tom's step involves multiplying both sides by 3, which is a valid operation.
- Katie's step involves simply changing the constant on the right side without a valid operation shown.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and might not accurately follow the steps or verify their correctness. They might incorrectly validate Katie's step due to a lack of understanding of how to properly manipulate equations.
- **Basic:** Students at this level should understand basic manipulations but might be confused by the presentation or make careless errors. They are likely to recognize Tom's step as correct but may be unsure or incorrectly assess Katie's step.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily identify Tom's step as correct and Katie's as incorrect based on standard algebraic rules.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will quickly verify both steps and choose the correct answer without hesitation.

## 6: Estimate percentages.
Given the clarity of the correct manipulation and the obvious mistake in Katie's suggestion:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (some might see Tom's multiplication), B=20% (might guess Katie), C=10% (unlikely to see both), D=40% (not understanding either).
- **Basic:** A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced:** A=90%, B=0%, C=5%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
