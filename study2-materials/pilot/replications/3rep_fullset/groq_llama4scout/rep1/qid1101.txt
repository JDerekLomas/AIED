To approach this question, let's break it down into steps and consider what students at different ability levels might do.

## Step 1: Understanding the Ratio
The question states that Josh and Lucy share money in the ratio \(3:7\). This means that for every 3 parts Josh gets, Lucy gets 7 parts. The total parts are \(3 + 7 = 10\).

## 2: Finding the Value of One Part
Josh receives \(£84\), and his share is represented by 3 parts of the ratio. To find out how much money one part represents, we divide Josh's share by his parts: \(£84 / 3 = £28\). This means one part equals \(£28\).

## 3: Calculating Lucy's Share
Lucy's share is represented by 7 parts. To find out how much Lucy receives, we multiply the value of one part by Lucy's parts: \(7 \times £28 = £196\).

## 4: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(£196\), which matches our calculation for Lucy's share.
- Option B: \(£58.80\), which does not match.
- Option C: \(£28\), which is the value of one part, not Lucy's share.
- Option D: \(£36\), which seems to relate to Josh's share or a misunderstanding.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with ratios and sharing. They might not understand how to apply the ratio to find Lucy's share or might confuse the shares.
- A: 40% (some might get it right by chance or correct calculation)
- B: 20% (miscalculation)
- C: 20% (think one part is Lucy's share)
- D: 20% (misunderstand Josh's share as Lucy's)

### basic
Students here have a basic understanding of ratios but might make calculation errors.
- A: 60% (understand the concept, calculate correctly)
- B: 15% (calculation mistake)
- C: 15% (confuse parts)
- D: 10% (misinterpret shares)

### proficient
These students understand ratios well and can apply them to solve problems but might occasionally make minor errors.
- A: 80% (calculate correctly)
- B: 5% (minor calculation error)
- C: 10% (misinterpretation)
- D: 5% (rare mistake)

### advanced
Advanced students are confident and accurate with ratios and proportions.
- A: 95% (accurately calculate Lucy's share)
- B: 0% (unlikely to make a calculation error leading to this answer)
- C: 0% (unlikely to confuse one part with Lucy's share)
- D: 5% (a very rare error)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
