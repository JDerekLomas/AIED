To approach this question, let's consider what rounding to 1 significant figure entails. When rounding a number to 1 significant figure, we look at the first digit of the number. If the second digit is 5 or greater, we round up the first digit; if it's less than 5, we leave the first digit unchanged. All digits after the first digit are then set to zero.

The number given is \( 95365 \). 

1. The first digit is \( 9 \).
2. The second digit is \( 5 \).

Since the second digit is \( 5 \), we round up the first digit. So, \( 9 \) becomes \( 10 \), but since we're working with significant figures and the concept of rounding, this translates to \( 10 \) being represented as \( 1 \) followed by zeros, which in this context (when dealing with significant figures), results in \( 100000 \) when properly rounded to 1 significant figure because we effectively look at the number as \( 9.5365 \times 10^4 \) and then apply the rounding rules.

Given this, let's predict the student responses based on ability levels:

### Below Basic
Students at this level may struggle with basic concepts of rounding and significant figures. They might not fully understand the rules or apply them incorrectly.
- A: \( 10000 \) could be a plausible mistake if they incorrectly round down or misunderstand significant figures.
- B: \( 90000 \) might seem reasonable if they round down.
- C: \( 100000 \) is the correct answer; however, these students might not get it.
- D: \( 95365 \) might be chosen if they don't understand rounding.

Prediction: 
- A=30% (incorrect rounding)
- B=30% (incorrect rounding)
- C=20% (correct but challenging for this group)
- D=20% (leaving the number as is, indicating a lack of understanding)

### Basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding but may still make simple mistakes.
- They are more likely to understand the concept of rounding to 1 significant figure but might struggle with the specifics of this number.

Prediction:
- A=15% (still some confusion)
- B=20% (some still round down)
- C=60% (understand and apply correctly)
- D=5% (better understanding means fewer leave it as is)

### Proficient
Students here have a good grasp of the concepts.
- They should mostly get it right but might make occasional mistakes.

Prediction:
- A=5% (rare mistake)
- B=10% (occasional error)
- C=80% (correct application)
- D=5% (rarely leave it unchanged)

### Advanced
Students at this level have a deep understanding and rarely make mistakes on such concepts.

Prediction:
- A=0% (no mistake expected)
- B=0% (no mistake expected)
- C=95% (confidently correct)
- D=5% (possibly checking or ensuring accuracy)

So, 
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
