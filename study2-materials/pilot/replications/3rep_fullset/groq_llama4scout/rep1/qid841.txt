## Step 1: Understand the question and the spinners
The question involves two spinners, each with sections labeled 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, and 5. The task is to determine how many cells in a sample space diagram would contain a score of 4 when the two spinners are spun and their scores are added together.

## 2: Identify combinations that result in a score of 4
To achieve a score of 4, the possible combinations are (1,3), (3,1), (3,1 is not possible since there's no 1 on the second spinner that can pair with a 3 on the first to give 4, but) (1,3) and (3,1). Given the spinners, (1,3) and (3,1) are the only potential combinations. However, we must consider the actual numbers on the spinners: there are two 3s on each spinner and only one 1 on each.

## 3: Calculate the number of ways to achieve a score of 4
- For (1,3), there is 1 '1' on the first spinner and 2 '3's on the second spinner, giving 1*2 = 2 combinations.
- For (3,1), there are 2 '3's on the first spinner and 1 '1' on the second spinner, giving 2*1 = 2 combinations.

## 4: Sum the combinations for a total
Adding these combinations together: 2 (from (1,3)) + 2 (from (3,1)) = 4 combinations.

## 5: Consider student understanding and potential errors
Students might struggle with accurately counting the combinations, especially if they misunderstand the distribution of numbers on the spinners or fail to systematically consider all possible pairings.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not accurately count or might misunderstand the concept of a sample space. They could choose any option based on a lack of understanding. Given the simplicity of the question, some might incorrectly choose D (0) because they don't see a straightforward way to get 4, or they might choose an answer without calculation. A=10%, B=15%, C=20%, D=55%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding but might make errors in counting or in systematically approaching the problem. They are more likely to calculate but could make simple mistakes. A=5%, B=10%, C=70%, D=15%.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept and can systematically count the outcomes. They are likely to get the correct answer. A=0%, B=5%, C=90%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also quickly and accurately calculate the outcomes. They are highly likely to choose the correct answer. A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=20% D=55%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%
proficient: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
