To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question step by step.

## Step 1: Understanding the Reflection Line
The dashed line in the coordinate grid represents the line \(y = -x\). To reflect a point across this line, we need to find the perpendicular line to \(y = -x\) that passes through the point, find the intersection point with \(y = -x\), and then extend the same distance on the other side of \(y = -x\) to locate the reflected point. However, a more straightforward approach for reflecting a point \((x, y)\) across the line \(y = -x\) is to simply take the coordinates \((-y, -x)\).

## 2: Identifying Point P and Reflecting It
The point \(P\) is given as \((0, 5)\). To find its reflection across the line \(y = -x\), we apply the transformation: \((-y, -x) = (-5, 0)\).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
Given the reflection of point \(P(0, 5)\) across \(y = -x\) is \((-5, 0)\), let's look at the provided options:
- A: \((-5, 0)\)
- B: \((-4, -1)\)
- C: \((-2, 2)\)
- D: \((-4, 5)\)

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with coordinate geometry and reflections. They might not understand the concept of reflecting across \(y = -x\) or might confuse it with reflecting across the x-axis or y-axis. Given the straightforward nature of this specific question, some might guess or apply incorrect transformations. 
  - A: \(60\%\) (correct, but could be guessed)
  - B: \(20\%\) (plausible mistake)
  - C: \(10\%\) (less likely, but possible miscalculation)
  - D: \(10\%\) (distractor, possibly thinking of a different transformation)

- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make simple errors. They should understand the reflection across \(y = -x\) but could misapply it.
  - A: \(80\%\) (most would get it right)
  - B: \(10\%\) (some mistakes)
  - C: \(5\%\) (minor miscalculations)
  - D: \(5\%\) (confusing with another type of transformation)

- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with coordinate geometry and should accurately apply the reflection.
  - A: \(95\%\) (almost all get it right)
  - B: \(3\%\) (rare mistakes)
  - C: \(1\%\) (very occasional miscalculation)
  - D: \(1\%\) (unlikely, but possible confusion)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident and accurate in their applications.
  - A: \(100\%\) (all get it right, as it's a straightforward application)
  - B: \(0\%\)
  - C: \(0\%\)
  - D: \(0\%\)

## 5: Conclusion
Based on the steps and considering the nature of the question, the predictions would be:

below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=100% B=0% C=0% D=0%

The best answer is A.
