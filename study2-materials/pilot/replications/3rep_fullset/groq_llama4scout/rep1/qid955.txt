To solve this, let's first understand the question and then predict the student responses based on their ability levels.

The question provides a graph showing the water depth (in cm) over time (in minutes) as a block of ice melts. The points on the graph are: (0,0), (1,1), (2,3), (3,6), (4,9), and (5,10). The task is to find the difference in water depth between the first minute and the third minute.

At 1 minute, the water depth is 1 cm. At 3 minutes, the water depth is 6 cm. The difference is \(6 - 1 = 5\) cm.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to interpret the graph and calculate the difference in water depth between two specific times.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve misreading the graph or incorrectly calculating the differences. However, given the straightforward nature of this question, with clear and simple numbers, it seems less likely to trigger complex misconceptions.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with reading the graph or performing the subtraction. They might not accurately identify the depths at 1 and 3 minutes or might add instead of subtract. Given the simplicity of the numbers (1 cm and 6 cm), even struggling students are likely to be able to read the graph and perform basic subtraction, but errors are still possible. 
  - A (5): 20% (guessing or incorrect calculation)
  - B (6 cm): 10% (misinterpreting the question or calculation error)
  - C (5 cm): 60% (correct answer)
  - D (2 cm): 10% (incorrect calculation or graph reading)

- **Basic:** Students at this level should be able to read the graph and perform simple calculations. 
  - A (5): 5% 
  - B (6 cm): 5% 
  - C (5 cm): 85% 
  - D (2 cm): 5%

- **Proficient:** These students are expected to understand graphs and perform calculations accurately.
  - A (5): 0% 
  - B (6 cm): 0% 
  - C (5 cm): 95% 
  - D (2 cm): 5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level would not only answer correctly but also understand the context and possibly offer more insightful responses if the question allowed for it.
  - A (5): 0% 
  - B (6 cm): 0% 
  - C (5 cm): 98% 
  - D (2 cm): 2%

The best answer is C. 

Given the analysis:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=98% D=2%

Thus, reformatted to fit the required response format:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=98% D=2%
