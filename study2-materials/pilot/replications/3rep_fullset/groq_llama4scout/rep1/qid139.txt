To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question asks students to multiply the two terms indicated by the arrows in the brackets \((5p-4)(2p-3)\), which are \(-4\) and \(-3\). The correct calculation is \((-4) \times (-3) = 12\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception when multiplying negative numbers is that two negatives make a negative, rather than a positive. However, in this specific case, the question directly asks for the product of \(-4\) and \(-3\), which might make it straightforward for students to recognize that multiplying two negatives gives a positive.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
The options given are:
A: \( +7 \)
B: \( -12 \)
C: \( +12 \)
D: \( -7 \)

The correct answer is C: \( +12 \).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic operations, including the multiplication of negative numbers. They might not understand that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result. There's a high chance they could choose B: \( -12 \) because they apply the operation but forget the rule about negatives. Some might choose D: \( -7 \) or A: \( +7 \) due to a complete misunderstanding. 
  - A: 10%
  - B: 60%
  - C: 20%
  - D: 10%

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still be prone to simple errors. They should know that two negatives make a positive, but might make calculation mistakes. 
  - A: 5%
  - B: 30%
  - C: 60%
  - D: 5%

- **Proficient:** Students at this level are more likely to understand the concept of multiplying negative numbers correctly and apply it accurately. Mistakes here would be less common.
  - A: 2%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 90%
  - D: 3%

- **Advanced:** These students are expected to have a strong grasp of algebraic concepts, including the rules for multiplying negative numbers. Errors are minimal.
  - A: 1%
  - B: 2%
  - C: 95%
  - D: 2%

Therefore, the predicted percentages are:

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=30% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%
