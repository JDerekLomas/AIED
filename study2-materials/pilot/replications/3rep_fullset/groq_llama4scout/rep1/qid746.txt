To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 4+12 \div(2+2)= \), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with it.

The question requires the application of the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right). The correct calculation is:
\[ 4 + 12 \div (2 + 2) \]
\[ = 4 + 12 \div 4 \]
\[ = 4 + 3 \]
\[ = 7 \]

This corresponds to option B.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception is to perform operations from left to right without following the order of operations. For this question, a likely incorrect approach would be:
\[ 4 + 12 \div (2 + 2) = 4 + 12 \div 2 + 2 \]
\[ = 4 + 6 + 2 \]
\[ = 12 \]
This incorrect calculation leads to option C.

## 2: Analyzing Difficulty Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand or apply the order of operations correctly. They are more likely to make simple arithmetic errors or not follow the correct order, potentially leading them to choose incorrect options based on simple miscalculations.

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with applying the rules consistently, especially in more complex expressions.

- **Proficient**: These students are expected to have a solid grasp of the order of operations and should be able to apply it correctly in most cases.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the order of operations but can also apply it in complex scenarios and are less likely to make errors.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
Given the question and likely misconceptions:
- The correct answer, B=7, seems straightforward for those who understand the order of operations.
- A common mistake could lead to C=12, as it reflects a misunderstanding of the order of operations.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: Might struggle significantly; could see A=30% (incorrect but simple result), B=20% (correct, but low understanding), C=30% (common mistake), D=20%.
- **Basic**: Should have a better grasp; potentially A=10%, B=60% (as they start to understand the order), C=20%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Expected to mostly get it right; likely A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Very few errors; possibly A=0%, B=95%, C=5%, D=0%.

## 5: Final Predictions
Considering typical student performance and common errors:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- **basic**: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=95% C=5% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=5% D=0%
