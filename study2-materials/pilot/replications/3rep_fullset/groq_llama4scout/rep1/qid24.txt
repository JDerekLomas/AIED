## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it might test.
The question asks students to solve for $\bigstar$ in the equation $\bigstar \times 4 = 108$. This requires students to divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find $\bigstar$. A common misconception could involve incorrect operations or misunderstandings of how to isolate $\bigstar$, but given the simplicity of the equation, it seems straightforward.

## 2: Solve the equation to identify the correct answer.
To find $\bigstar$, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: $\bigstar = 108 \div 4 = 27$. This means the correct answer is B) $27$.

## 3: Analyze the potential for errors based on the question's structure.
The question is simple and doesn't have an immediately obvious trap that would lead students to one of the incorrect answers over the others, except for common calculation mistakes. However, the answer choices are not all wildly implausible, which might tempt some students into making calculation errors.

## 4: Predict student responses at different ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic division or multiplication facts. They might not even attempt to solve the equation or could make significant calculation errors. Option A ($112$) could be a result of adding $108 + 4$, option D ($104$) could be from $108 - 4$, and option C ($432$) could result from $108 \times 4$. Option B ($27$) is the correct answer but might be challenging for these students to derive.
- **Basic:** Students here should be able to understand the need to divide by 4 but might make calculation errors. They are likely to get the correct answer (B) or make a simple mistake leading to one of the other options.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily solve the equation and choose B) $27$. They are less likely to make calculation errors.
- **Advanced:** These students will almost certainly choose B) $27$ correctly, as the question is well within their skill level.

## 5: Estimate percentages for each ability level.
Given the simplicity of the question and assuming typical student performance:
- **Below Basic:** A=$20\%$ (adding), B=$30\%$ (correct but struggling), C=$20\%$ (multiplying), D=$30\%$ (subtracting).
- **Basic:** A=$5\%$, B=$80\%$, C=$5\%$, D=$10\%$.
- **Proficient:** A=$1\%$, B=$95\%$, C=$2\%$, D=$2\%$.
- **Advanced:** A=$0\%$, B=$99\%$, C=$0.5\%$, D=$0.5\%$.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=99% C=0.5% D=0.5%
