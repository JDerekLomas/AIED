## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the equation of a line with a gradient of 2 that passes through the point (1,1). The general equation of a line can be given by \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the gradient and \(b\) is the y-intercept.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Equation
Given that the gradient \(m = 2\) and the line passes through \((1,1)\), we can substitute these values into the equation to find \(b\). So, \(1 = 2(1) + b\), which simplifies to \(1 = 2 + b\), and therefore \(b = -1\). This means the equation of the line is \(y = 2x - 1\).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(y = 2x + 1\)
- Option B: \(y = x + 2\)
- Option C: \(y = 2x - 1\)
- Option D: \(y = 2x\)

## 4: Evaluating Student Responses by Ability Level
### below_basic
Students at this level may struggle with substituting values into the equation of a line or may not fully understand the significance of the gradient and a point in determining the line's equation. They might be inclined to pick options that look "right" or might guess.
- A: 20% (some might recognize the gradient but not calculate correctly)
- B: 20% (not recognizing the gradient or point)
- C: 30% (if they recall the point and gradient correctly or by chance)
- D: 30% (simple equation, might seem correct without substitution)

### basic
Basic level students should have a grasp of the equation of a line and be able to substitute values to some extent. However, they might make careless mistakes or not thoroughly check their work.
- A: 15% (might confuse with a similar equation)
- B: 10% (should recognize gradient is wrong)
- C: 60% (understand how to apply gradient and point)
- D: 15% (some might see it as too simple and not fitting)

### proficient
Proficient students are expected to accurately apply the formula and check their work. They should easily identify the correct equation.
- A: 5% (error in calculation or substitution)
- B: 5% (clearly incorrect gradient)
- C: 85% (correct application of gradient and point)
- D: 5% (should see it's missing the point given)

### advanced
Advanced students not only understand the concepts but also can quickly evaluate the options based on their knowledge.
- A: 0% (quickly identify incorrect)
- B: 0% (gradient is wrong)
- C: 95% (rapidly confirm the correct equation)
- D: 5% (unlikely to be chosen with confidence)

## 5: Conclusion
Given these considerations, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
