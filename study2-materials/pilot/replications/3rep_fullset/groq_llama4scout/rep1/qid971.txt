To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The operation \(50 + 25\) is a straightforward addition. The question aims to see if students can identify when this operation is appropriate.

## Step 1: Understanding the Operations
- **Decrease \(50\) by \(25\)**: This would involve subtraction, \(50 - 25\).
- **Increase \(50\) by \(25\)**: This would involve addition, \(50 + 25\).
- **Find the product of \(50\) and \(25\)**: This would involve multiplication, \(50 \times 25\).
- **How many \(25\)s are there in \(50\)**: This would involve division, \(50 \div 25\).

## 2: Analyzing the Question Options
The correct answer is **B: Increase \(50\) by \(25\)**, because that's the scenario where you would calculate \(50 + 25\).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the basic operations and their applications. They might confuse operations or not fully grasp the question.
  - A: Decrease \(50\) by \(25\) might seem plausible if they misunderstand "increase" as "decrease", so \(10\%\).
  - B: The correct answer, but they might not identify it correctly, so \(20\%\).
  - C: Finding the product might seem like a complex operation they're not sure about, so \(30\%\).
  - D: How many \(25\)s are in \(50\) could be confusing, but it's a division, so \(40\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple mistakes.
  - A: \(5\%\)
  - B: \(70\%\)
  - C: \(15\%\)
  - D: \(10\%\)
- **Proficient**: Students with a solid grasp of operations and their applications.
  - A: \(2\%\)
  - B: \(90\%\)
  - C: \(5\%\)
  - D: \(3\%\)
- **Advanced**: Students who not only understand but can apply concepts accurately.
  - A: \(1\%\)
  - B: \(95\%\)
  - C: \(2\%\)
  - D: \(2\%\)

## 4: Formatting the Response
Given the analysis:

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=70% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
