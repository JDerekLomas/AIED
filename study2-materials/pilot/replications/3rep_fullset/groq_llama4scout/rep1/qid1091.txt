## Step 1: Understand the question and the content it tests
The question requires students to simplify an expression by collecting like terms. The expression given is \( \frac{2}{3} k^{2}+\frac{1}{6} k^{2}-\frac{1}{3} k^{2}+\frac{5}{6} k^{2} \). This involves adding and subtracting fractions with different denominators, which can be a challenge for some students.

## 2: Determine the common denominator for the fractions
To add and subtract these fractions, students need to find a common denominator, which in this case is 6. So, the expression can be rewritten as \( \frac{4}{6} k^{2}+\frac{1}{6} k^{2}-\frac{2}{6} k^{2}+\frac{5}{6} k^{2} \).

## 3: Collect like terms
Collecting like terms, we get \( \frac{4+1-2+5}{6} k^{2} = \frac{8}{6} k^{2} \). Simplifying \( \frac{8}{6} \) gives \( \frac{4}{3} k^{2} \), which can also be written as \( 1 \frac{1}{3} k^{2} \).

## 4: Evaluate the difficulty of the question
This question tests the ability to collect like terms and simplify fractions. The fractions have different denominators, requiring students to find a common denominator. However, the numbers are manageable, and the expression is straightforward.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with finding a common denominator and adding/subtracting fractions. They might not simplify the fraction \( \frac{8}{6} \) correctly or might not collect the like terms properly. Option B seems like it could be a trap for those who don't fully simplify, and option D could appeal to those who misinterpret the fractions. A=20% (guessing), B=30% (partially correct but not fully simplified), C=20% (correct but requires conversion to mixed fraction), D=30% (misinterpretation of fractions).
- **Basic:** Students here should have a better grasp of fractions and collecting like terms. They might still make errors in simplifying or converting fractions. A=30% (direct calculation), B=20% (not fully simplified), C=40% (correct), D=10% (less likely to misinterpret significantly).
- **Proficient:** These students should easily find the common denominator, collect like terms, and simplify. A=10% (only if they miscalculate), B=5% (unlikely), C=80% (correct and efficient), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should quickly and accurately solve the problem. A=0% (unlikely to make a straightforward error), B=0% (not a likely response), C=95% (correct), D=5% (occasional misstep).

## 6: Assign percentages based on predicted student performance
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic:** A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
- **Proficient:** A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
