To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with multiplying negative numbers.

The question asks to identify the incorrect calculation among four options:
A: \( (-7) \times 2=-14 \)
B: \( (-7) \times(-2)=-14 \)
C: \( 7 \times 2=14 \)
D: \( 7 \times(-2)=-14 \)

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception with multiplying negative numbers is that students often struggle with the rule that two negative numbers multiplied together give a positive result. The correct rules are:
- A negative times a positive gives a negative.
- A positive times a positive gives a positive.
- A negative times a negative gives a positive.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( (-7) \times 2 = -14 \) is correct because a negative times a positive gives a negative.
- Option B: \( (-7) \times(-2) = 14 \), not \(-14\), because two negatives give a positive.
- Option C: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) is correct as both are positive.
- Option D: \( 7 \times(-2) = -14 \) is correct because a positive times a negative gives a negative.

## 3: Identifying the Incorrect Calculation
The incorrect calculation is Option B: \( (-7) \times(-2)=-14 \), which should equal \( 14 \), not \(-14\).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may not fully understand the rules for multiplying positive and negative numbers. They might choose any option randomly or based on a common misconception. 
  - A: 20% (think it's correct due to lack of understanding)
  - B: 60% (mistakenly think two negatives make a negative)
  - C: 5% (unlikely to choose this as they might see it as obviously correct)
  - D: 15% (similar reasoning)

- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding but might still struggle with the nuances of negative number multiplication.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 80% (common misconception that two negatives make a negative)
  - C: 5%
  - D: 5%

- **Proficient:** Students at this level understand the basic rules but might still make careless mistakes.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 20% (some might still fall into the misconception trap)
  - C: 5%
  - D: 70%

- **Advanced:** These students have a strong grasp of the concepts and are less likely to make mistakes.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 5% (only a few might make a very careless error)
  - C: 0%
  - D: 95%

## 5: Converting to Requested Format
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=20% B=60% C=5% D=15%
- **basic:** A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=20% C=5% D=70%
- **advanced:** A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=5% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=20% C=5% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
