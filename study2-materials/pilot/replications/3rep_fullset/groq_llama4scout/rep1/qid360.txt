## Step 1: Understand the concept of median
The median of a set of numbers is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

## 2: Arrange the given numbers in ascending order
The given numbers are: $2, 2, 4, 7, 10, -15$. Arranging them in ascending order: $-15, 2, 2, 4, 7, 10$.

## 3: Determine the median
Since there are 6 numbers (an even amount), the median will be the average of the 3rd and 4th numbers. The 3rd number is 2 and the 4th number is 4. So, the median is $(2 + 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3$.

## 4: Analyze the options
- A: $7$
- B: $4$
- C: $3$
- D: $5.5$

## 5: Identify the correct answer
The correct answer is C: $3$.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level may not understand the concept of median or may struggle with ordering numbers and calculating averages. They might incorrectly choose A, B, or D due to misunderstanding or miscalculation. Given the straightforward nature of the question once the concept is understood, and without triggering complex calculations, we might expect a significant portion to make errors. Let's assume A=20% (guessing a high number), B=20% (picking a number from the list), C=30% (some might get it right by luck or basic understanding), D=30% (misinterpreting the calculation).

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple errors. They are more likely to get it right than below_basic but could still be tempted by obvious numbers. Let's assume A=10%, B=15%, C=60% (most get it right), D=15%.

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept well and can apply it. Errors would be minimal. Let's assume A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concept but can also apply it in complex scenarios. They are highly likely to get it right. Let's assume A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 7: Correct the predictions to fit the required format and make them plausible
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- **basic**: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
