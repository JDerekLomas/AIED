To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing and then predict the student responses based on their ability levels.

The question presents a linear graph showing that 10 miles correspond to £8. It's asking students to find out how many miles Kay traveled if her company paid her £80. This can be solved by understanding the rate of pay per mile and then using it to calculate the distance traveled for £80.

## Step 1: Understand the Relationship Shown in the Graph
The graph indicates that for every 10 miles, Kay is paid £8. This implies that for 1 mile, she is paid £8 / 10 = £0.80.

## 2: Calculate the Distance Traveled for £80
To find out how many miles Kay traveled for £80, we divide the total amount paid (£80) by the rate per mile (£0.80). So, miles traveled = £80 / £0.80 = 100 miles.

## 3: Analyze the Options
Given the calculation, the correct answer is B) 100 miles.

## 4: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with understanding the graph, calculating rates, or applying them to find distances. They might incorrectly assume a direct proportion without calculating the rate per mile or make errors in division. Expect a high chance of selecting incorrect options, especially those that seem to directly correlate with the given numbers (like A: 96, C: 64, or D: 80) without proper calculation. 
  - A=30% (guessing or miscalculation), B=20% (some might get it through luck or simple proportion), C=20%, D=30%.

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make errors in calculations or in interpreting the graph. They might correctly calculate the rate (£0.80 per mile) but then make a mistake in dividing £80 by £0.80. 
  - A=20%, B=60% (most should get it right with proper calculation), C=10%, D=10%.

- **Proficient:** These students are likely to understand the concept well and apply it correctly. They should easily calculate the rate and then the distance.
  - A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concept but are also likely to solve it efficiently and accurately. Errors would be minimal.
  - A=0%, B=98%, C=1%, D=1%.

## 5: Format the Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
- advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
