To approach this question, let's analyze the options and the concept being tested. A cube number is the result of multiplying an integer by itself twice, i.e., \(n^3\). The question provides four options: \(1\), \(3\), \(9\), and "None of these numbers are cube numbers."

## Step 1: Understanding Cube Numbers
Recall that \(1^3 = 1\), \(2^3 = 8\), \(3^3 = 27\). Notice that \(1\) is a cube number because \(1^3 = 1\). The number \(9\) is not a perfect cube of an integer since \(2^3 = 8\) and \(3^3 = 27\), and there's no integer \(n\) where \(n^3 = 9\). The number \(3\) is not a cube number as \(3\) does not equal \(n^3\) for any integer \(n\).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(1\) is indeed a cube number (\(1^3 = 1\)).
- Option B: \(3\) is not a cube number.
- Option C: \(9\) is not a cube number; it's a square number (\(3^2 = 9\)).
- Option D: "None of these numbers are cube numbers" is incorrect because \(1\) is a cube number.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
### Below Basic
Students at this level might not fully understand what a cube number is or may confuse it with square numbers. They might choose \(9\) because they recognize it as a power of a number (though not a cube) or randomly select an option.
- A: \(20\%\) (some might remember \(1\) as a special case)
- B: \(20\%\) (random guess)
- C: \(40\%\) (misconception that \(9\) could be a cube)
- D: \(20\%\) (not understanding any option)

### Basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of powers and might recall \(1\) as \(1^3\), but might be less sure about \(3\) and \(9\).
- A: \(40\%\) (recognize \(1\) as a cube)
- B: \(15\%\) (some might confuse with square or prime)
- C: \(30\%\) (common mistake, thinking \(9\) could be a cube)
- D: \(15\%\) (not realizing \(1\) is a cube)

### Proficient
Proficient students are likely to know that \(1^3 = 1\) and that \(9\) is not a cube but might still be unsure or second-guess on \(3\).
- A: \(70\%\) (clearly \(1\) is a cube)
- B: \(5\%\) (unlikely to think \(3\) is a cube)
- C: \(15\%\) (some might misremember or miscalculate)
- D: \(10\%\) (unlikely, given \(1\) is a known cube)

### Advanced
Advanced students are very familiar with cubes and squares and are unlikely to make mistakes on simple identifications.
- A: \(90\%\) (confidently identify \(1\) as a cube)
- B: \(0\%\) (know \(3\) is not a cube)
- C: \(0\%\) (know \(9\) is not a cube)
- D: \(10\%\) (perhaps a very cautious or overthinking response)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=30% D=15%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=15% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
