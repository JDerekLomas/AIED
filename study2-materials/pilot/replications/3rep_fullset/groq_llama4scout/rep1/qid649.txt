To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the misconceptions it might trigger.

The question revolves around the commutative property of multiplication, which states that \(a \times b = b \times a\), and the distributive property, though the latter isn't directly needed here. Tom's statement implies an equivalence that isn't immediately obvious to be incorrect or correct without calculation, potentially triggering a misconception about how multiplication operates with decimals. Katie's statement is a direct application of the commutative property.

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's Statement
Tom says \(5 \times 3.9 = 3 \times 5.9\). Let's calculate both sides to verify:
- \(5 \times 3.9 = 19.5\)
- \(3 \times 5.9 = 17.7\)
So, Tom is incorrect.

## 2: Analyze Katie's Statement
Katie says \(5 \times 3.9 = 3.9 \times 5\). According to the commutative property of multiplication:
- \(5 \times 3.9 = 3.9 \times 5\)
Thus, Katie is correct.

## 3: Consider Student Understanding at Different Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication facts and understanding of decimal operations. They might not recognize the commutative property or could make calculation errors. There's a high chance they would not understand Katie's statement and might incorrectly agree with Tom or choose randomly.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic operations but might not fully understand properties like commutativity. They might calculate or reason through Tom's statement and see it's incorrect but might not immediately recognize Katie's statement as correct due to lack of deep understanding of multiplication properties.
- **Proficient**: These students understand multiplication properties, including commutativity, and can apply them. They should easily see Katie's correctness and Tom's incorrectness.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand these properties but can also quickly identify and apply them in various contexts. They should have no trouble recognizing both statements' validity or lack thereof.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (might think Tom's statement could be true without calculating), B=20% (recognize Katie but not necessarily through correct reasoning), C=10% (unlikely to understand both correctly), D=30% (might see both as incorrect through some form of calculation or intuition).
- **Basic**: A=30%, B=40%, C=20%, D=10% (as they start to grasp properties but might still make errors).
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=60%, C=25%, D=5% (most recognize Katie's correctness, some might still doubt).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=80%, C=15%, D=5% (clear understanding of the commutative property).

## 5: Final Predictions
- **below_basic**: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
- **basic**: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=10% B=60% C=25% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=80% C=15% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=25% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=80% C=15% D=5%
