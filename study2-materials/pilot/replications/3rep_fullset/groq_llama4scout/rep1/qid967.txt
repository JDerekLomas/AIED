## Step1: Understanding the Question
The question provides a recursive formula to calculate the terms of a sequence: \( x_{n+1}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{x_{n}+11}} \), with a starting value of \( x_{1}=0.6 \). The task is to find the value of \( x_{2} \) using this information.

## 2: Calculating \( x_{2} \)
To find \( x_{2} \), we substitute \( x_{1}=0.6 \) into the formula:
\[ x_{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{0.6+11}} \]
\[ x_{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{11.6}} \]
\[ x_{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{11.6}} \]
\[ x_{2}=\sqrt{0.0862 \ldots} \]
\[ x_{2}=0.2936 \ldots \]

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
The question might seem prone to errors if students miscalculate or misunderstand the order of operations. However, given the straightforward nature of the calculation and the fact that it doesn't involve common misconceptions like confusing \( x_{n} \) with \( n \) or misapplying the formula, most students who understand the basics of algebra and calculation should be able to compute \( x_{2} \) correctly.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the calculation, potentially leading to incorrect answers due to miscalculation or not following the order of operations correctly. A might be chosen by those who incorrectly calculate but still arrive at a plausible answer. B could be chosen by those who make a calculation error leading to this specific incorrect value. C seems to be the correct answer based on our calculation. D would be chosen by those who either cannot calculate or recognize their calculation is incorrect.

- **Basic:** Students here are likely to perform the calculation correctly but might be more prone to errors in calculation or using a calculator incorrectly. They are likely to choose C as the correct answer.

- **Proficient:** These students are expected to calculate \( x_{2} \) accurately with minimal chance of error, thus choosing C.

- **Advanced:** Similarly, these students will accurately calculate \( x_{2} \) and choose C, with a high degree of confidence in their calculation.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Given the calculation and analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (those who might get a close but incorrect value), B=15% (those who make a specific error), C=40% (those who somehow manage to get it right or are lucky), D=25% (those who cannot calculate or are unsure).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=0%, C=95%, D=0%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=100%, D=0%.

The best answer is C. 

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=95% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
