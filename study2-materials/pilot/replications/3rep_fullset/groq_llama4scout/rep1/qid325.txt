To approach this question, let's first understand what's being tested and the common misconception. The question asks for the total degrees in \( 1 \frac{1}{4} \) full turns. A full turn is \( 360^{\circ} \), so \( 1 \frac{1}{4} \) turns would be \( 1.25 \times 360^{\circ} \).

## Step 1: Calculate the correct answer
To find the correct answer, we multiply \( 1.25 \) by \( 360^{\circ} \): \( 1.25 \times 360 = 450^{\circ} \). So, the correct answer is \( 450^{\circ} \), which corresponds to option A.

## 2: Identify the misconception
A common misconception could be misunderstanding the fraction of a turn or miscalculating the multiplication. For example, some might calculate \( 1 \frac{1}{4} \) of \( 360^{\circ} \) as \( 360^{\circ} + \frac{1}{4} \times 360^{\circ} \) but then incorrectly calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \times 360^{\circ} \) as \( 90^{\circ} \) and add it to \( 360^{\circ} \) to get \( 450^{\circ} \) or make a calculation error.

## 3: Analyze the difficulty level and potential errors
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with fractions and multiplication. They might incorrectly calculate \( 1 \frac{1}{4} \times 360 \) or misunderstand what \( 1 \frac{1}{4} \) turns mean. They could choose D (\( 90^{\circ} \)) if they only consider \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a turn, or they might pick C (\( 125^{\circ} \)) if they mistakenly think \( 1 \frac{1}{4} \) times something small equals a small number.
- **Basic**: These students should be able to handle the multiplication and understand fractions better. However, they might still make errors in calculation, such as \( 1.25 \times 300 = 375 \) (close to B), or \( 1.25 \times 360 = 450 \) correctly.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level are expected to handle calculations confidently. They are likely to get the correct answer, A (\( 450^{\circ} \)), but a small percentage might still make a careless error.
- **Advanced**: These students are highly confident in their calculations and understanding of mathematical concepts. They are very likely to choose the correct answer, A (\( 450^{\circ} \)).

## 4: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option
Given the correct answer is A (\( 450^{\circ} \)):
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (if they manage to calculate or recall correctly), B=10%, C=20% (misconception about fractions of a circle), D=30% (simple fraction misunderstanding).
- **Basic**: A=70%, B=15%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: A=98%, B=1%, C=1%, D=0%.

The best answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
