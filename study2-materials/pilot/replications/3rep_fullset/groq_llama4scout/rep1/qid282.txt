To approach this question, let's first understand the properties of a rhombus and what the question is asking. A rhombus is a type of polygon that has all sides of equal length. One of the key properties of a rhombus is that its diagonals bisect each other at right angles (are perpendicular). However, the sides of a rhombus are not necessarily perpendicular to each other.

Given the question and the options provided:

- Option A: \( A B \) and \( B C \) - These are adjacent sides of the rhombus, and while they are of equal length, there is no property of a rhombus that requires adjacent sides to be perpendicular.
- Option B: \( A C \) and \( D B \) - These are the diagonals of the rhombus. A well-known property of a rhombus is that its diagonals are perpendicular to each other.
- Option C: \( A B \) and \( D C \) - These are opposite sides of the rhombus. Opposite sides of a rhombus are parallel, not necessarily perpendicular.
- Option D: None of them - This would be correct if none of the pairs of lines listed must be perpendicular.

Now, let's consider the likelihood of students at different ability levels choosing each option:

### Below Basic
Students at this level might not fully understand the properties of a rhombus or might confuse properties of different shapes.
- A: They might think adjacent sides could be perpendicular but are not sure, so let's say 20%.
- B: They might recall that diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so 40%.
- C: They might think opposite sides could be perpendicular, 20%.
- D: Not understanding, they might default to this option, 20%.

### Basic
Students at this level have a better grasp of basic geometric shapes but might still struggle with applying properties correctly.
- A: They know adjacent sides aren't necessarily perpendicular, so 10%.
- B: They recall diagonals are perpendicular, so 60%.
- C: They know opposite sides are parallel, not perpendicular, so 5%.
- D: If they're unsure or think none, 25%.

### Proficient
Students at this level have a solid understanding of geometric properties.
- A: They know adjacent sides aren't perpendicular, 5%.
- B: They are confident diagonals are perpendicular, so 80%.
- C: They understand opposite sides are parallel, 0%.
- D: They see that B is correct, so 15%.

### Advanced
Students at this level can apply their knowledge with ease and understand the implications of properties.
- A: They know this isn't a property, 0%.
- B: They confirm diagonals are perpendicular, so 90%.
- C: They see this as incorrect based on properties of a rhombus, 0%.
- D: They might see the correct answer and dismiss this, 10%.

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=0% D=15%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
