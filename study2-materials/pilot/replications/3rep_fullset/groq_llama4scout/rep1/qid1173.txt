To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding that students might have.

The question asks which of the statements shows that \( t \) is greater than \( 9 \). The correct answer is \( D: t > 9 \).

- **A: \( t < 9 \)** suggests \( t \) is less than 9, which is the opposite of what we're looking for.
- **B: \( t = 9 \)** suggests \( t \) is equal to 9, not greater than 9.
- **C: \( t \leq 9 \)** suggests \( t \) is less than or equal to 9, which also does not indicate \( t \) is greater than 9.
- **D: \( t > 9 \)** directly states \( t \) is greater than 9.

## Misconceptions and Understanding:

1. **Understanding Inequality Symbols**: Students need to understand the meaning of inequality symbols (\( <, >, \leq, \geq \)) and how they relate to the concept of greater than, less than, equal to, etc.

2. **Common Errors**: A common error might be choosing \( C: t \leq 9 \) if a student mistakenly believes that "less than or equal to 9" implies \( t \) can be greater than 9, which is not the case. Another error could be choosing \( B: t = 9 \) if a student thinks being equal to 9 somehow implies being greater than 9.

## Predictions by Ability Level:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding inequality symbols and basic concepts of comparison. They might choose \( A \) or \( C \) thinking those show \( t \) is greater than 9 due to confusion with the symbols.  
  - \( A = 20\% \) (some might mistakenly think "less than" could imply greater)
  - \( B = 30\% \) (equating equality with greater than)
  - \( C = 30\% \) (similar confusion)
  - \( D = 20\% \) (only a few understand the direct statement)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple mistakes.
  - \( A = 10\% \)
  - \( B = 15\% \)
  - \( C = 15\% \)
  - \( D = 60\% \)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well but might still second-guess themselves.
  - \( A = 5\% \)
  - \( B = 5\% \)
  - \( C = 5\% \)
  - \( D = 85\% \)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and are less likely to make careless mistakes.
  - \( A = 0\% \)
  - \( B = 0\% \)
  - \( C = 0\% \)
  - \( D = 100\% \)

Thus, the prediction is:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
