To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The question aims to assess students' understanding of calculating the mean (average) of a set of numbers and their ability to identify the correct formula application among given options.

The mean of a set of numbers is calculated by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the count of numbers. For the given set \(0, 0, 2, 6, 9\), the correct calculation for the mean would be \(\frac{0 + 0 + 2 + 6 + 9}{5}\).

## Step 1: Analyze Option A
Option A is \(0 + 0 + 2 + 6 + 9 \div 5\). This option incorrectly suggests dividing only the 9 by 5 before adding the other numbers, which is not the correct method for calculating the mean.

## Step2: Analyze Option B
Option B is \(\frac{2 + 6 + 9}{5}\). This option ignores the two 0s in the dataset, which is incorrect because all numbers in the dataset must be included in the calculation of the mean.

## 3: Analyze Option C
Option C is \(\frac{2 + 6 + 9}{3}\). This option not only ignores the two 0s but also incorrectly uses 3 as the divisor instead of 5, which is the total count of numbers.

## 4: Analyze Option D
Option D states "None of them". For this to be correct, all other options (A, B, C) must be incorrect.

## 5: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the basic concept of mean. They might not understand that all numbers must be included or that the divisor should be the count of all numbers. Option A might seem plausible because it involves adding all numbers but incorrectly places the division. Option B could appeal because it simplifies the calculation but omits steps. Option C seems too simplistic and wrong. Given their potential confusion, they might lean towards A or B due to a partial understanding, but significant errors are expected. 
  - A: 40% ( partial understanding, mistakenly thinks division applies as shown)
  - B: 30% (ignoring zeros seems like an easy step)
  - C: 15% (seems straightforwardly wrong but might confuse with another simple calculation)
  - D: 15% (unlikely to choose this as they might see an appealing option)

- **Basic**: Students here understand the concept of mean but might make calculation errors or misunderstand the formula. They are more likely to recognize the mistake in B and C but might still fall for A.
  - A: 25% 
  - B: 20% 
  - C: 10% 
  - D: 45% (as they might realize the errors in A, B, and C)

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of calculating the mean. They should easily spot the errors in A, B, and C.
  - A: 10% 
  - B: 5% 
  - C: 5% 
  - D: 80%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but are also quick to identify misconceptions. They would immediately see that A, B, and C are incorrect.
  - A: 5% 
  - B: 0% 
  - C: 0% 
  - D: 95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=10% D=45%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
