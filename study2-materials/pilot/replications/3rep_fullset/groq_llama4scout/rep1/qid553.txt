To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The question requires students to find the second fraction card that, when multiplied by \( \frac{3}{7} \), gives a product of \( \frac{2}{5} \). This involves solving for the unknown fraction in the equation \( \frac{3}{7} \times x = \frac{2}{5} \).

## Step 1: Solving for the Unknown Fraction
To find \( x \), we rearrange the equation: \( x = \frac{2}{5} \div \frac{3}{7} \). This can also be written as \( x = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{7}{3} \) because dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.

## 2: Calculating the Unknown Fraction
Now, let's calculate \( x \): \( x = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{7}{3} = \frac{2 \times 7}{5 \times 3} = \frac{14}{15} \).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
Given the calculation, the correct answer is \( \frac{14}{15} \), which corresponds to option B. 

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with fraction multiplication and division, and may not accurately solve for \( x \). They might incorrectly calculate or choose an option that seems "easy" but isn't correct, such as \( \frac{6}{35} \) (D) or \( \frac{1}{35} \) (C), due to a lack of understanding of fraction operations. \( A = 20\% \) \( B = 30\% \) \( C = 20\% \) \( D = 30\% \)
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic fraction operations but might make careless mistakes. They are likely to attempt the calculation but could end up with incorrect answers due to slips in calculation, such as not inverting the second fraction properly when dividing. \( A = 10\% \) \( B = 60\% \) \( C = 10\% \) \( D = 20\% \)
- **Proficient:** These students understand fraction operations well and are likely to solve the problem correctly. However, a small percentage might still make errors due to miscalculation. \( A = 5\% \) \( B = 80\% \) \( C = 5\% \) \( D = 10\% \)
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of fractions and are highly likely to solve the problem correctly with minimal chance of error. \( A = 0\% \) \( B = 90\% \) \( C = 0\% \) \( D = 10\% \)

## 5: Conclusion
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
