## Step 1: Understanding the problem
The problem requires finding the smallest number of packets of bread rolls and hot dogs that Sophie can buy such that she has exactly the same number of bread rolls as hot dogs. The number of bread rolls in each packet is 18, and the number of hot dogs in each packet is 15.

## 2: Identifying the mathematical concept needed
To solve this, we need to find the smallest number where 18 times the number of packets of bread rolls equals 15 times the number of packets of hot dogs. This translates to finding the lowest common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 15, as we are looking for the smallest quantities that make the total number of bread rolls and hot dogs equal.

## 3: Considering student misconceptions and understanding
Students might confuse the concepts of highest common factor (HCF), lowest common multiple (LCM), sum, and product. The HCF is about finding the greatest common divisor, the LCM is about finding the smallest common multiple, the sum is adding two numbers together, and the product is multiplying two numbers together.

## 4: Analyzing the specific question for potential errors
The question asks for the concept needed to solve the problem, which is to find the LCM of 18 and 15 to ensure Sophie buys an equal number of bread rolls and hot dogs. This requires understanding that the LCM gives us the smallest quantity that both 18 and 15 can divide into evenly, which is crucial for matching the quantities of bread rolls and hot dogs.

## 5: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with understanding the concepts of LCM, HCF, sum, and product. They might randomly select an option or choose based on a misunderstanding of the terms. Given the context, they might lean towards "Sum" or "Product" as these are more straightforward operations they might be familiar with, but not directly relevant. So, A=20%, B=30%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Basic:** Basic level students might have a grasp of what LCM and HCF mean but could still confuse them or not fully understand the application. They might recognize that LCM is about finding a common multiple, which sounds relevant. Thus, C might be a stronger choice here. So, A=10%, B=20%, C=50%, D=20%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students should have a clear understanding of LCM, HCF, sum, and product. They would recognize that to match the quantities (and thus have an equal number of hot dogs and bread rolls), finding the LCM of 18 and 15 is necessary. So, A=5%, B=5%, C=80%, D=10%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand these concepts but also their applications. They would quickly identify that the LCM is needed to solve the problem efficiently. So, A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 6: Translating predictions into the required format
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=10% B=20% C=50% D=20%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The best answer is C.
