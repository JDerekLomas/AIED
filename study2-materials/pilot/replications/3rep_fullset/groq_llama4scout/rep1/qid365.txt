To approach this question, let's consider the definitions and common misconceptions related to regular polygons. A regular polygon is defined as a shape with equal sides and equal angles. 

## Step 1: Understanding Regular Polygons
A regular polygon has two key properties: all sides are of equal length, and all internal angles are equal. 

## Step 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom's example is a triangle with 3 equal sides and 3 equal angles. By definition, if a triangle has 3 equal sides, it is equilateral, and if it has 3 equal angles, each angle must be 60 degrees because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, Tom's shape is indeed a regular polygon.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie's example is a parallelogram with 2 pairs of parallel sides marked. For a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length and parallel, but it does not necessarily have all sides equal or all angles equal unless it's a specific type like a rhombus or a rectangle. However, not all parallelograms have equal angles or all sides of equal length, which are required for a regular polygon.

## 4: Identifying Misconceptions
A common misconception might be that any shape with some symmetrical properties (like parallel sides) could be considered regular. However, the specific definition of a regular polygon requires all sides and all angles to be equal.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the basic definitions. They might incorrectly think Katie's parallelogram could be regular because it has parallel sides, or they might not understand that Tom's triangle fits the definition. So, they could be split between thinking only Tom is correct (because they recognize the triangle) and not understanding Katie's example properly. 
  - A: 40% (recognize Tom's triangle)
  - B: 20% (might think Katie's parallelogram could work)
  - C: 10% (unlikely to understand both correctly)
  - D: 30% (completely unsure or incorrect)

- **Basic**: Students here understand basic geometry but might still fall into common traps. They should recognize Tom's triangle as a regular polygon but might be less sure about Katie's parallelogram.
  - A: 60% (recognize Tom, not Katie)
  - B: 15% (might incorrectly think Katie's could be regular)
  - C: 10% (some might correctly identify both)
  - D: 15% (not sure or incorrect)

- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid grasp of polygon properties. They should easily identify Tom's triangle as regular and Katie's parallelogram as not regular.
  - A: 80% (correctly identify Tom)
  - B: 5% (unlikely to think Katie's is the only one)
  - C: 10% (some might still get it right)
  - D: 5% (unlikely to be completely incorrect)

- **Advanced**: These students have a deep understanding and can apply definitions precisely. They will easily see Tom's triangle as regular and Katie's parallelogram as not.
  - A: 90% (clearly understand Tom's polygon)
  - B: 0% (unlikely to consider Katie's as the only option)
  - C: 5% (almost certainly understand both)
  - D: 5% (highly unlikely to be incorrect)

The best answer is A. 

Given the detailed thought process and predicted student responses, here is the final answer in the exact format requested:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
