To approach this question, let's consider the common misconceptions and the specific details of the question that might influence students' answers.

The question involves converting kilograms to tonnes, where \(1\) tonne = \(1000\) kilograms. Therefore, \(3000 \, \text{kg}\) is equal to \(3\) tonnes.

## Step 1: Understanding the Conversion
The conversion factor between kilograms and tonnes is crucial. Students need to remember that \(1\) tonne equals \(1000\) kilograms.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve misunderstanding the conversion factor or misplacing the decimal point. However, this question is relatively straightforward as it directly tests the recall of the conversion factor between kilograms and tonnes.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(3\) tonnes, which is correct because \(3000 \, \text{kg} = 3\) tonnes.
- Option B: \(30\) tonnes, which would be \(30,000 \, \text{kg}\).
- Option C: \(300\) tonnes, equivalent to \(300,000 \, \text{kg}\).
- Option D: \(3000000\) tonnes, which is an excessively large number for the conversion.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic conversions. They might not recall that \(1\) tonne = \(1000\) kg or could incorrectly apply the conversion.
  - A: \(60\%\) (correct, through luck or basic understanding)
  - B: \(20\%\) (possibly thinking \(3000 \times 10 = 30,000\))
  - C: \(10\%\) (misunderstanding the conversion significantly)
  - D: \(10\%\) (completely off, possibly misinterpreting the question)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple mistakes.
  - A: \(80\%\) (understand the basic conversion)
  - B: \(15\%\) (small mistake in conversion)
  - C: \(4\%\) (larger mistake)
  - D: \(1\%\) (unlikely but possible for those not understanding place value)

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of conversions.
  - A: \(95\%\) (confident in the conversion)
  - B: \(4\%\) (minor error, possibly a slip)
  - C: \(1\%\) (unlikely but could happen with a significant misconception)
  - D: \(0\%\) (highly unlikely)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident in their mathematical abilities.
  - A: \(99\%\) (strong understanding, unlikely to make a mistake)
  - B: \(1\%\) (very rare mistake)
  - C: \(0\%\) (extremely unlikely)
  - D: \(0\%\) (completely unlikely)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=15% C=4% D=1%
proficient: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
