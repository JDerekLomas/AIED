To approach this question, let's consider what makes a number a cube number: it is the result of multiplying an integer by itself twice (e.g., \(2^3 = 8\), \(3^3 = 27\)). The question presents four options: \(3\), \(6\), \(9\), and "None of these numbers are cube numbers."

## Step 1: Analyze Option A - \(3\)
\(3\) is not a perfect cube because there is no integer that, when cubed, equals \(3\). The closest cubes are \(1^3 = 1\) and \(2^3 = 8\), so \(3\) is not a cube number.

## 2: Analyze Option B - \(6\)
\(6\) is not a perfect cube. There are no integer values that, when cubed, result in \(6\). The nearest cubes are \(1^3 = 1\) and \(2^3 = 8\), confirming \(6\) is not a cube.

## 3: Analyze Option C - \(9\)
\(9\) is a square of \(3\) (\(3^2 = 9\)) but not a cube of any integer because \(2^3 = 8\) and \(3^3 = 27\), so \(9\) is not a cube number.

## 4: Analyze Option D - None of these numbers are cube numbers
Given that \(3\), \(6\), and \(9\) are not cube numbers, the correct answer is indeed "None of these numbers are cube numbers."

## 5: Consider Student Understanding
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand what a cube number is or might confuse it with square numbers. They might mistakenly choose \(9\) because they recognize it as a perfect square and mistakenly think it's also a cube, or they might not identify any as cube numbers but could randomly select an option. 
- **Basic:** Basic level students should have a grasp of the concept of cube numbers but might struggle with recalling perfect cubes. They are likely to eliminate \(9\) (since they might recall it as a square), and then might guess among \(3\), \(6\), or \(D\).
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are expected to know common cube numbers and understand the concept well. They should quickly identify that none of \(3\), \(6\), or \(9\) are perfect cubes and choose \(D\).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will not only know the definition but also be familiar with common cube numbers. They should easily recognize \(3\), \(6\), and \(9\) are not cubes and select \(D\).

## 6: Predict Student Choices
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (some might recognize \(3\) is not a large number and consider it), B=15% (less likely), C=30% (some confuse with squares), D=35% (or choose not to guess).
- **Basic:** A=10% (mistake), B=5% (unlikely), C=20% (confusing with squares), D=65% (most understand none are cube numbers).
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=2%, C=5%, D=88% (strong understanding).
- **Advanced:** A=2%, B=1%, C=2%, D=95% (excellent understanding).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=20% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=5% D=88%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=2% D=95%
