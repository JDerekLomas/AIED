To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it may pose.

The question requires students to find the number that will be in the ones/units column of the product of 58 and 22. 

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to multiply 58 by 22 and determine the digit in the ones place of the product.

## 2: Performing the Calculation
To solve this, we can perform the multiplication: \(58 \times 22\).

## 3: Calculation Steps
\(58 \times 20 = 1160\),
\(58 \times 2 = 116\),
Adding these together: \(1160 + 116 = 1276\).

## 4: Identifying the Ones Digit
The ones digit of 1276 is 6.

## 5: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
- A common misconception might involve incorrect multiplication or not understanding place value. However, this question specifically asks for the ones digit, which simplifies the task to considering only the ones digits of the numbers being multiplied (8 and 2), because the ones digit of the product of two numbers is the same as the product of their ones digits.

## 6: Focusing on Ones Digit Multiplication
The ones digit of \(58 \times 22\) is the same as the ones digit of \(8 \times 2 = 16\), which is 6.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication facts or understanding the concept of ones digits in multiplication. They might incorrectly calculate \(8 \times 2 = 16\) and then mistakenly think the answer is 16 (D), or they might not understand what the question is asking, leading to random guesses. 
    - A: 20% (might get it right by chance or partial understanding)
    - B: 10% (unlikely, as it requires understanding of multiplication and place value)
    - C: 10% (similarly, unlikely)
    - D: 60% (likely to choose this if they calculate 16 and misunderstand)

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic multiplication but might still make errors or get confused by the question's phrasing.
    - A: 60% (likely to get it right as they understand \(8 \times 2 = 16\), and the ones digit is 6)
    - B: 5% (unlikely)
    - C: 5% (unlikely)
    - D: 30% (might still confuse with the full product)

- **Proficient**: These students are confident in their multiplication skills and understand place value.
    - A: 80% (clearly understand \(8 \times 2 = 16\), so the ones digit is 6)
    - B: 5% (very unlikely)
    - C: 5% (very unlikely)
    - D: 10% (unlikely, as they know 16 is the product, not the ones digit)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident and accurate in their calculations.
    - A: 95% (will accurately determine the ones digit as 6)
    - B: 0% (extremely unlikely)
    - C: 0% (extremely unlikely)
    - D: 5% (very unlikely, as they understand the distinction)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
basic: A=60% B=5% C=5% D=30%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
