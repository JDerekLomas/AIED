To predict how students at different ability levels would perform on this question, let's consider the nature of the question and common misconceptions related to interpreting graphs.

The question asks students to find the difference in the amount of potatoes consumed on Sunday compared to Saturday using a graph. This type of question tests students' ability to read data from a graph and perform a simple subtraction.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question seems straightforward and does not inherently suggest a complex calculation or a deep conceptual misunderstanding. It requires the student to look at the graph, identify the values for Saturday and Sunday, and then subtract the smaller value from the larger.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be misreading the values from the graph or incorrectly calculating the difference. However, without specific values provided in the question stem, we rely on general principles of graph interpretation and subtraction.

## 3: Analyzing by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with reading the graph accurately or performing the subtraction. They might not accurately identify the values for Saturday and Sunday or might make calculation errors.
- **Basic:** Students at this level should be able to read the graph and perform simple calculations but might still make occasional errors in reading values or in subtraction.
- **Proficient:** These students are expected to accurately read the graph and perform calculations with ease, minimizing errors.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are likely to not only answer correctly but also do so efficiently, with little to no chance of making a careless mistake.

## 4: Predicting Responses
Given that specific numbers are not provided, let's assume hypothetical values for illustration: if Saturday's consumption was 20kg and Sunday's was 22kg, the correct answer would be 2kg.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic:** Might have difficulty, let's say A=10%, B=10%, C=60% (guessing), D=20%.
- **Basic:** Should do better but still make some errors, A=5%, B=5%, C=20%, D=70%.
- **Proficient:** Expected to get it mostly right, A=2%, B=2%, C=5%, D=91%.
- **Advanced:** Highly likely to get it right, A=1%, B=1%, C=2%, D=96%.

However, without exact graph values, these are speculative. Normally, we'd expect:
- A straightforward question like this to have most students (especially proficient and advanced) selecting the correct answer, assuming it's clearly labeled on the graph.

## 6: Adjusting for This Specific Question
Given there's no visual or specific numbers, and assuming a simple scenario where the difference is indeed one of the provided options:
- Let's assume the graph clearly shows a small difference, making C) \(2 \mathrm{~kg}\) a plausible correct answer.

The answer is below_basic: A=5% B=5% C=70% D=20%
basic: A=2% B=2% C=10% D=86%
proficient: A=1% B=1% C=5% D=93%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=2% D=98%
