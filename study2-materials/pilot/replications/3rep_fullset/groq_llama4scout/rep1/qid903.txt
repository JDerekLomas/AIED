To approach this question, let's analyze the shapes provided and the concept of a line of symmetry, then consider how students at different ability levels might respond.

## Step 1: Understanding the Concept of Line of Symmetry
A line of symmetry is an imaginary line that divides a shape into two identical parts that are mirror images of each other. 

## 2: Analyzing the Shapes
- **A: A Trapezium** - A trapezium does not necessarily have a line of symmetry, although some special types of trapeziums (like isosceles trapeziums) do. Without specifying, we can't assume it has one.
- **B: A circle with a 90-degree sector removed** - This shape does not have a line of symmetry because removing a sector disrupts the circular symmetry.
- **C: A crescent (moon) shape** - This shape does not have a line of symmetry as it is not symmetric about any line.
- **D: All of them** - This option suggests that all the shapes provided have a line of symmetry.

## 3: Evaluating Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the basic concept of symmetry. They might incorrectly choose shapes based on visual appeal rather than symmetry. 
  - A: 30% (some might recognize trapezium can have symmetry)
  - B: 20% (might think sector removal creates symmetry)
  - C: 20% (visual appeal)
  - D: 30% (lack of understanding)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple errors.
  - A: 40% (recognize trapezium's potential symmetry)
  - B: 15% (less likely to think a modified circle has symmetry)
  - C: 10% (understand crescent doesn't have symmetry)
  - D: 35% (some still unsure)

- **Proficient:** These students understand symmetry well.
  - A: 60% (know trapezium can have symmetry)
  - B: 5% (unlikely to think modified circle has symmetry)
  - C: 5% (know crescent doesn't have symmetry)
  - D: 30% (some might still consider the possibility)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply it accurately.
  - A: 80% (confidently identify trapezium's symmetry potential)
  - B: 0% (know circle sector removal affects symmetry)
  - C: 0% (understand crescent shape)
  - D: 20% (few would consider this seriously)

## 4: Making Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic:** A=40% B=15% C=10% D=35%
- **Proficient:** A=60% B=5% C=5% D=30%
- **Advanced:** A=80% B=0% C=0% D=20%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=40% B=15% C=10% D=35%
proficient: A=60% B=5% C=5% D=30%
advanced: A=80% B=0% C=0% D=20%
