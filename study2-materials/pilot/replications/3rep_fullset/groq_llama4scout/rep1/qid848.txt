To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question provides a Venn diagram showing the prime factors of 36 and 90. For 36, the prime factors are \(2^2 \times 3^2\), and for 90, they are \(2 \times 3^2 \times 5\). The Venn diagram illustrates the shared and unique prime factors: there's a 2 in the 36 set, \(2, 3, 3\) in the intersection, and a 5 in the 90 set. However, to find the lowest common multiple (LCM) of 36 and 90, we need to take the highest power of each prime number found in the prime factorization of both numbers. Thus, the LCM would be \(2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5\).

## Step 1: Understanding the LCM Calculation
The LCM of 36 and 90 requires combining the highest powers of all prime factors involved: \(2^2, 3^2,\) and \(5\). So, the correct calculation for the LCM is \(2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5\).

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A: \(2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5\) directly corresponds to the prime factorization needed for the LCM of 36 and 90, which is \(2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5\).

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B: \(2 \times 3 \times 3\) lacks the second 2 and the 5, which are necessary for the LCM.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C: \(2 \times 5\) is missing the \(3^2\) and only includes one 2, which is insufficient for the LCM.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D: \(2 \times 3 \times 5\) is missing the second 2 and the second 3, which are necessary for the LCM.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding prime factorization and LCM. They might choose options that seem simplest or most familiar. Option B (\(2 \times 3 \times 3\)) might seem right because it includes prime factors of both, but it's incorrect due to missing numbers. Option D (\(2 \times 3 \times 5\)) seems to combine unique factors but lacks the full prime factorization. Given the difficulty, many might guess or choose randomly, but a significant portion could choose B or D due to partial understanding.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might not fully grasp how to apply it to find the LCM from a Venn diagram. They might recognize the need for all prime factors but struggle with the powers. Option A seems correct but might be chosen by those who understand Venn diagrams and LCM well. Others might choose B or D due to partial knowledge.
- **Proficient**: These students should understand how to find the LCM using prime factors. They would likely choose A (\(2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5\)) as it correctly represents the LCM. Mistakes might come from not carefully reading the diagram or misunderstanding the concept of LCM.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level would easily identify the correct option A and might find the question straightforward. They are less likely to make errors.

## 7: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might get it by chance or partial understanding), B=30% (partial understanding), C=20% (simple factors), D=30% (simple combination).
- **Basic**: A=50% (understand the concept but might struggle with application), B=25%, C=10%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=80% (strong understanding of LCM and prime factors), B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=95% (very strong understanding), B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
