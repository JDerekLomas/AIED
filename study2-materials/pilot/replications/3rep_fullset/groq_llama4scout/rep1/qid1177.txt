## Step 1: Understand the question and the table of values
The question provides a table of values for the equation \(x + 2y = 8\) and asks to find the value that should replace the star (\(\bigstar\)) when \(x = 2\).

## 2: Identify the equation and the value of \(x\) for the star
The equation given is \(x + 2y = 8\), and we need to find \(y\) when \(x = 2\).

## 3: Substitute \(x = 2\) into the equation to solve for \(y\)
Substituting \(x = 2\) into the equation \(x + 2y = 8\), we get \(2 + 2y = 8\).

## 4: Solve for \(y\)
Solving \(2 + 2y = 8\) for \(y\), we subtract 2 from both sides to get \(2y = 6\), and then divide both sides by 2 to find \(y = 3\).

## 5: Consider the potential for student errors
This question tests the ability to substitute values into an equation and solve for the unknown. A common misconception could be incorrectly rearranging the equation or making a calculation error.

## 6: Evaluate the answer choices
Given \(y = 3\) when \(x = 2\), let's look at the answer choices:
- A: \(16\)
- B: \(3\)
- C: \(2\)
- D: \(6\)

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substitution and solving for \(y\). They might not correctly solve the equation or might choose an answer based on incorrect calculations. Given the simplicity of the calculation, some might still get it right by chance or simple substitution, but errors are likely. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 60\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebraic manipulations. They should be able to substitute \(x = 2\) into the equation and solve for \(y\) with some effort. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 80\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebraic manipulations and should easily solve for \(y\). \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 90\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 5\%\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and should quickly and accurately solve the equation. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 95\%\), \(C = 2.5\%\), \(D = 2.5\%\).

## 8: Format the predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
- basic: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
- proficient: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2.5% D=2.5%

The best answer is B.
