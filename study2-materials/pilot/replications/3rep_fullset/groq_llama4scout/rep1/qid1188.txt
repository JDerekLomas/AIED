To approach this question, let's first analyze what it's testing and then predict the student responses based on their ability levels.

The question provides a recursive formula for a sequence: \(x_{n+1}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{x_{n}+1}}\), and asks for \(x_2\) given \(x_1 = 0.5\). This involves substituting \(x_1\) into the formula to find \(x_2\).

## Step 1: Calculate \(x_2\)
Given \(x_1 = 0.5\), we substitute into the formula:
\[x_2 = \sqrt{\frac{1}{0.5 + 1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.5}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\]

## 2: Evaluate \(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\)
\[\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \approx 0.8165\]
This value is closest to option A: \(0.8164 \ldots\), which suggests a calculation or rounding to that effect.

## 3: Analyze Potential Misconceptions or Errors
The formula and calculation seem straightforward, but let's consider potential errors:
- A common error could be incorrect substitution or calculation. For instance, mistakenly calculating \(\frac{1}{0.5} = 2\) and then \(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\), but this doesn't match any options directly.
- Another potential error is not fully evaluating the expression, such as approximating too early or incorrectly.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the calculation or substituting into the formula. They might not calculate \(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\) correctly or might choose an option that seems "right" based on a rough estimate. Given the options, B and C are plausible but incorrect guesses, with A being the correct answer. **Below Basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%**
- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp of basic algebraic manipulations but might still make calculation errors. They are more likely to get it right but could be swayed by incorrect calculations. **Basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%**
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebraic expressions and calculations. They are likely to calculate \(x_2\) correctly. **Proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%**
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are not only proficient but also able to handle more complex calculations or recognize patterns. They would almost certainly calculate \(x_2\) correctly. **Advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%**

The best answer is A.
