To approach this question, let's first analyze the methods used by Tom and Katie to calculate \(19 \times 8\).

Tom's method: \(20 \times 8 - 1 \times 8\)
This can be simplified to:
\(160 - 8 = 152\)

Which is correct because \(19 \times 8 = 152\).

Katie's method: \(10 \times 8 + 9 \times 8\)
This can be simplified to:
\(80 + 72 = 152\)

Which is also correct because \(19 \times 8 = 152\).

Both Tom and Katie arrive at the correct answer using their respective methods. 

Given that both methods are correct and yield the same result, let's consider how students at different ability levels might respond:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication facts or with understanding the methods presented. They might not accurately calculate \(19 \times 8\) or might not understand why both methods are correct. They could mistakenly identify one as incorrect or both as incorrect due to miscalculation or misunderstanding. 
  - A: Only Tom = 20%
  - B: Only Katie = 20%
  - C: Both Tom and Katie = 30%
  - D: Neither is correct = 30%

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic multiplication but might still make errors in applying methods or in calculations. They are more likely to recognize the correctness of both methods but could still be tricked if they miscalculate or misunderstand the application. 
  - A: Only Tom = 15%
  - B: Only Katie = 15%
  - C: Both Tom and Katie = 60%
  - D: Neither is correct = 10%

- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand multiplication well and can apply various strategies. They are likely to see the logic in both Tom's and Katie's methods and understand that both lead to the correct answer. 
  - A: Only Tom = 5%
  - B: Only Katie = 5%
  - C: Both Tom and Katie = 85%
  - D: Neither is correct = 5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the methods but can also evaluate their efficiency and applicability. They would easily see that both methods are correct and might even generate their own methods. 
  - A: Only Tom = 2%
  - B: Only Katie = 2%
  - C: Both Tom and Katie = 95%
  - D: Neither is correct = 1%

Therefore, the predicted percentages are:

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
