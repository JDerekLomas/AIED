## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question presents a frequency table showing the number of pets and their corresponding frequencies. The task is to determine the total number of people Dave recorded the results of.

## 2: Identifying the total number of people
To find the total number of people, we need to sum up all the frequencies given in the table: $4 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 20$.

## 3: Analyzing potential misconceptions
A common misconception could be misunderstanding what the frequency represents or misinterpreting the question. However, the question directly asks for the total number of people, which is essentially the sum of all frequencies.

## 4: Evaluating the difficulty level
The question seems straightforward as it directly relates to the definition of frequency in a table. However, students might get confused if they misread the table or misunderstood the concept of frequency.

## 5: Predicting student responses
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic or understanding the concept of frequency. They might choose an option that corresponds to a single frequency or a small number, not understanding that they need to sum all frequencies. $A=20\%$, $B=15\%$, $C=10\%$, $D=55\%$ (though D is correct, they might not calculate it correctly).
- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to understand the concept of frequency but might make arithmetic mistakes. $A=5\%$, $B=5\%$, $C=10\%$, $D=80\%$.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should easily understand the concept and perform the calculation correctly. $A=0\%$, $B=0\%$, $C=5\%$, $D=95\%$.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level would not only understand the concept but also be able to apply it quickly and accurately. $A=0\%$, $B=0\%$, $C=0\%$, $D=100\%$.

## 6: Adjusting predictions based on realistic errors
Given the simplicity of the calculation ($4 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 20$), most students, even at the basic level, should be able to get it right if they read the question and table correctly.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
basic: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
