## Step 1: Understand the question and the common misconception
The question requires converting 27 cm to meters. A common misconception is that students might not correctly remember that 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, or they might incorrectly apply the conversion factor.

## 2: Analyze the conversion process
To convert centimeters to meters, we divide by 100 since 1 meter = 100 centimeters. So, \(27 \, \text{cm} = \frac{27}{100} \, \text{m} = 0.27 \, \text{m}\).

## 3: Evaluate the answer choices
- A: \(0.3\) is incorrect because it suggests 27 cm is 0.3 meters, implying 1 meter = 33.33 cm.
- B: \(2700\) is incorrect because it seems to confuse the conversion, possibly thinking 27 cm * 100 = 2700 meters, which is not correct.
- C: \(0.27\) is the correct answer, as shown in step 2.
- D: \(2.7\) is incorrect because it suggests 27 cm equals 2.7 meters, which would imply 1 meter = 10 cm.

## 4: Consider student ability levels and potential errors
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand the basic conversion between centimeters and meters. They might choose B (2700) because they incorrectly multiply by 100 without understanding the unit conversion, or they might choose A (0.3) or D (2.7) due to a lack of understanding of the metric system.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still struggle with the conversion. They are more likely to choose C (0.27) but might still be tempted by A (0.3) or D (2.7) if their understanding of conversions is not solid.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily convert 27 cm to 0.27 meters. They are less likely to make errors, so most would choose C (0.27).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level would have a strong understanding of conversions and would quickly and accurately choose C (0.27).

## 5: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level for each option
Given the analysis, here are the predicted percentages:

- **Below Basic:** A=30% (simple mistake), B=40% (misapplication of conversion), C=20% (correct but challenging), D=10% (another incorrect conversion).
- **Basic:** A=20% (common misconception), B=10% (less likely but still possible mistake), C=60% (correct conversion), D=10% (incorrect conversion).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (unlikely mistake), B=2% (very unlikely), C=90% (correct), D=3% (small chance of error).
- **Advanced:** A=1% (rare mistake), B=0% (unlikely), C=98% (almost certain correct), D=1% (very rare error).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=0% C=98% D=1%
