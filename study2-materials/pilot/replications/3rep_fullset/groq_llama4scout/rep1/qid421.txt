To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls or clarity in the calculations required.

The question asks for the correct calculation of the number of seconds in \(2\) days. 

1. There are \(24\) hours in a day.
2. There are \(60\) minutes in an hour.
3. There are \(60\) seconds in a minute.

So, to find the number of seconds in \(2\) days, one would calculate:
- \(2 \times 24\) to get the total hours in \(2\) days,
- Then multiply by \(60\) to get the total minutes,
- And finally multiply by \(60\) again to get the total seconds.

This leads to the correct formula: \(2 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60\).

Let's evaluate the options with this in mind:

A: \(2 \times 12 \times 60\) - Incorrect because it uses \(12\) hours (presumably thinking of a half day or mistakenly using hours in a half day) instead of \(24\).
B: \(2 \times 12 \times 60 \times 60\) - Incorrect for the same reason as A, plus it unnecessarily multiplies by \(60\) again.
C: \(2 \times 24 \times 60\) - Incorrect because it only calculates up to minutes, not seconds.
D: \(2 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60\) - Correct, as it accurately calculates the total seconds in \(2\) days.

Given these explanations:

- **below_basic**: These students might struggle with unit conversions or the basic structure of time (hours, minutes, seconds). They might be confused by the options and not clearly understand the conversion factors. 
  - A: \(30\%\) (mistake in understanding basic time units)
  - B: \(20\%\) (extension of A with an extra incorrect step)
  - C: \(30\%\) (gets part way but not fully)
  - D: \(20\%\) (understanding or guess)

- **basic**: These students understand basic conversions but might make simple errors.
  - A: \(15\%\)
  - B: \(10\%\)
  - C: \(25\%\)
  - D: \(50\%\)

- **proficient**: These students are comfortable with conversions and should find this straightforward.
  - A: \(5\%\)
  - B: \(5\%\)
  - C: \(10\%\)
  - D: \(80\%\)

- **advanced**: These students not only understand the conversions but are also less likely to make careless mistakes.
  - A: \(0\%\)
  - B: \(0\%\)
  - C: \(5\%\)
  - D: \(95\%\)

So, in the required format:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=25% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
