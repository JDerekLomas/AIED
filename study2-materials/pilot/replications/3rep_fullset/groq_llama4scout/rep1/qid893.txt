To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential pitfalls for students at different ability levels.

The question requires converting a weight given in kilograms and grams into tonnes. The conversion factors needed are:
- \(1\) kilogram \(= 0.001\) tonnes (since \(1\) tonne \(= 1000\) kilograms)
- \(1\) gram \(= 0.000001\) tonnes (since \(1\) tonne \(= 1,000,000\) grams)

Given: \(5\) kilograms and \(7\) grams.

## Step 1: Convert kilograms to tonnes
\(5\) kilograms \(= 5 \times 0.001 = 0.005\) tonnes

## 2: Convert grams to tonnes
\(7\) grams \(= 7 \times 0.000001 = 0.000007\) tonnes

## 3: Add the converted values
Total \(= 0.005 + 0.000007 = 0.005007\) tonnes

## 4: Analyze the options
- A: \(5007 t\) - Incorrect, as it suggests \(5007\) tonnes.
- B: \(0.05007 t\) - Incorrect, seems to misunderstand the conversion.
- C: \(5.007 t\) - Incorrect, suggests \(5.007\) tonnes, which is not correct.
- D: \(0.005007 t\) - Correct, matches our calculation.

## 5: Consider student misconceptions and errors
- A common misconception might be not converting correctly or misunderstanding the units. However, the question seems straightforward once the conversion factors are applied.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with unit conversions and are likely to choose an option that doesn't require complex calculations or might pick an answer that seems large or small but not necessarily calculated correctly. Option A could be tempting because it's a simple, large number, but the calculation isn't within their capability. **A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%**
- **Basic**: Students here understand basic conversions but might struggle with the precision of conversions or mixing units. They might incorrectly calculate or choose an option that seems reasonable but isn't calculated precisely. **A=10%, B=30%, C=30%, D=30%**
- **Proficient**: These students are familiar with conversions and should accurately calculate the answer. They are less likely to make errors in calculation but might still be distracted by seemingly reasonable options. **A=5%, B=10%, C=10%, D=75%**
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are comfortable with conversions and should easily identify the correct answer without being swayed by incorrect options. **A=0%, B=0%, C=5%, D=95%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=30% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=10% D=75%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
