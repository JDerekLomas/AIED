To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question involves reflecting a point \( P(3, -1) \) in the \( y \)-axis. The reflection of a point \( (x, y) \) in the \( y \)-axis gives a new point \( (-x, y) \). Therefore, reflecting \( P(3, -1) \) in the \( y \)-axis should give \( P'(-3, -1) \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to reflect point \( P(3, -1) \) in the \( y \)-axis. The correct answer should have the same \( y \)-coordinate but the opposite \( x \)-coordinate.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be changing the sign of the \( y \)-coordinate instead of the \( x \)-coordinate or not changing the coordinates at all. Another could be confusing the axis of reflection.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( (-3,-1) \) - Correct reflection across the \( y \)-axis.
- B: \( (0,-1) \) - Incorrect; suggests a shift to the \( y \)-axis rather than reflection.
- C: \( (-2,-1) \) - Incorrect; changes the \( x \)-coordinate but not to the correct reflection.
- D: \( (3,-1) \) - Incorrect; no change, suggesting no reflection occurred.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic coordinate geometry concepts. They might choose B (thinking the point moves to the y-axis), C (randomly changing the coordinate), or D (thinking nothing changes). A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make careless mistakes. They are likely to understand reflection in the \( y \)-axis involves changing the sign of \( x \), but might be tempted by obviously incorrect answers. A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students should have a solid grasp of coordinate geometry, including reflections. They are likely to get it right but might still consider other options briefly. A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to not only understand but also apply concepts with ease. They should have no trouble with this question. A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
