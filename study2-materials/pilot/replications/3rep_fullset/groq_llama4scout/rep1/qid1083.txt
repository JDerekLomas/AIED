## Step 1: Understand the question and the content it tests
The question requires students to expand and simplify the expression \((p+5)(p-4)\) and then compare it to the form \(p^{2} \triangle p \bigcirc\) to find the missing value \(\bigcirc\). The expansion of \((p+5)(p-4)\) yields \(p^{2} - 4p + 5p - 20 = p^{2} + p - 20\).

## 2: Identify the correct answer
By comparing \(p^{2} + p - 20\) to \(p^{2} \triangle p \bigcirc\), it's clear that \(\triangle = +\) (or simply understood as \(+\) for the linear term) and \(\bigcirc = -20\). This means the correct answer is \( \bigcirc = -20 \), which corresponds to option D.

## 3: Analyze potential misconceptions and student errors
A common misconception might involve incorrectly expanding the brackets or misunderstanding the signs. However, the structure of this question makes it relatively straightforward because it directly compares to a standard form. Students who are familiar with expanding brackets and simplifying expressions should easily identify \(\bigcirc\).

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with expanding the brackets or comparing the expanded form to the given form. They might incorrectly calculate the expansion or forget to account for the signs properly. Expect a high chance of error, with possibly A, B, or C being chosen due to miscalculations. \(A=20\%\), \(B=30\%\), \(C=30\%\), \(D=20\%\)
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make simple arithmetic errors. They are more likely to get the linear term correct but could struggle with the constant term. \(A=10\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=50\%\)
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to accurately expand and simplify the expression. They should easily identify \(\bigcirc = -20\), with minimal errors. \(A=5\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=85\%\)
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only accurately solve the problem but also do so efficiently. They are likely to choose the correct answer with near certainty. \(A=0\%\), \(B=0\%\), \(C=0\%\), \(D=100\%\)

## 5: Format the predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
- basic: A=10% B=20% C=20% D=50%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=20% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
