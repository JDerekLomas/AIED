## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question asks students to simplify the given algebraic expression: \( \frac{t^{2}+t-2}{t-1} \) if possible. The expression can be simplified by factoring the numerator.

## 2: Factor the Numerator
The numerator \( t^{2}+t-2 \) can be factored into \( (t+2)(t-1) \). Therefore, the expression becomes \( \frac{(t+2)(t-1)}{t-1} \).

## 3: Simplify the Expression
Given that \( \frac{(t+2)(t-1)}{t-1} \), we can cancel out the \( (t-1) \) from both the numerator and the denominator, but we must note that \( t \neq 1 \) because \( t = 1 \) would make the denominator zero, and division by zero is undefined. After cancellation, the simplified expression is \( t + 2 \).

## 4: Analyze Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to cancel terms without considering the restriction on \( t \) or to incorrectly factor the numerator. However, the question does not directly test cancellation with a common factor that would lead to an incorrect simple factorization (like \( t^2 + 2t + 1 \) being mistakenly factored). The main error could be not factoring the numerator correctly or not recognizing that \( t \neq 1 \).

## 5: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with factoring the numerator or simplifying the fraction. They might not factor \( t^{2}+t-2 \) correctly or might not see how to cancel \( (t-1) \), leading them to choose \( D \) (Does not simplify) or incorrectly simplify.
- **Basic**: Students here might correctly factor the numerator but then struggle with the concept of simplification or the condition that \( t \neq 1 \). They could choose \( A \) (correct) but might also be tempted by \( B \) or \( C \) if they make arithmetic mistakes.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to correctly factor and simplify, choosing \( A \) ( \( t+2 \) ). They understand algebraic manipulation and the conditions under which expressions are valid.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level will almost certainly choose \( A \) ( \( t+2 \) ), recognizing the factorization and the simplification without hesitation.

## 6: Estimate Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some get it through trial and error or simple insight), B=20% (error in simplification), C=10% (incorrect factorization leading to this), D=30% (can't simplify or don't see the factorization).
- **Basic**: A=60% (most can factor and simplify), B=15% (common error), C=10% (another common error), D=15% (struggle with concept).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (clear understanding), B=10% (occasional error), C=5% (rare error), D=5% (unaware of simplification).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (high confidence in algebraic manipulation), B=3% (rare mistake), C=1% (very rare), D=1% (almost never).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
