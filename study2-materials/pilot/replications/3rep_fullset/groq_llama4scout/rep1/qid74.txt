To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required for each option.

The question asks to identify which equation has no real solutions. Let's examine each option:

A) \( t^{2} - 45 = 0 \)  
This equation has real solutions: \( t = \sqrt{45} \) or \( t = -\sqrt{45} \). Students should easily recognize this as having real solutions.

B) \( t^{2} - 45 = -45 \)  
This simplifies to \( t^{2} = 0 \), which has one real solution: \( t = 0 \). Students should see this has a real solution.

C) \( t^{3} = -45 \)  
This equation has one real solution: \( t = -\sqrt[3]{45} \). Students familiar with cube roots should know this has a real solution.

D) \( t^{2} = -45 \)  
This equation has no real solutions because the square of any real number is non-negative. 

Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and understanding of different types of equations. They might not fully grasp the implications of squares and cubes on solution existence.
  - A: 20% (think it might not have solutions due to confusion)
  - B: 20% (similar confusion)
  - C: 15% (less likely to consider cube roots properly)
  - D: 45% (recognize that squares can't be negative, but might not articulate it well)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still fall into common traps.
  - A: 80% (recognize it has solutions)
  - B: 85% (see it simplifies to \( t^{2} = 0 \))
  - C: 70% (understand cube roots give real solutions)
  - D: 10% (might still think it has solutions or get confused)

- **Proficient:** These students are more secure in their understanding of equations and solution existence.
  - A: 95% (clearly see it has solutions)
  - B: 95% (easily simplify to \( t^{2} = 0 \))
  - C: 90% (know cube roots yield real solutions)
  - D: 5% (mostly understand squares can't yield negative values)

- **Advanced:** Students here have a deep understanding and can apply concepts with ease.
  - A: 100% (no doubt it has solutions)
  - B: 100% (same, no issues)
  - C: 100% (clear on real solutions from cube roots)
  - D: 0% (clearly identify it has no real solutions)

Given these considerations, and adjusting for a more realistic distribution based on common misconceptions and understanding:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=80% B=80% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=95% B=95% C=90% D=5%
advanced: A=100% B=100% C=100% D=0%
