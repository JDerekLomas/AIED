To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with solving equations.

The equation given is \(\frac{24}{x} = 6\). To solve for \(x\), one must multiply both sides by \(x\) to get \(24 = 6x\), which is what Tom suggests. This is a standard and correct algebraic manipulation.

Katie suggests \(24 = \frac{x}{6}\), which would be a correct manipulation if the original equation were \(\frac{24}{6} = x\), but it does not correctly follow from \(\frac{24}{x} = 6\). To get Katie's equation from the original, one would have to multiply both sides by \(x\) and then divide by 6, or equivalently, multiply by \(x\) and then multiply by \(\frac{1}{6}\), which essentially means multiplying by \(\frac{x}{6}\), not a straightforward step from the given equation.

## Step 1: Understanding the Algebraic Manipulation
The correct next step from \(\frac{24}{x} = 6\) is to multiply both sides by \(x\), yielding \(24 = 6x\), which supports Tom's suggestion.

## 2: Identifying Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrectly rearranging equations or not understanding the properties of equality. However, in this specific case, the question directly tests the understanding of a basic algebraic manipulation rather than a complex concept.

## 3: Analyzing Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not correctly identify Tom's step as valid but could mistakenly think Katie's step is correct due to a lack of understanding of how to properly rearrange the equation. 
  - A: 40% (Recognize Tom's correctness but not Katie's)
  - B: 20% (Incorrectly think only Katie is right)
  - C: 10% (Incorrectly think both are right)
  - D: 30% (Think neither is correct)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding of algebra. They are likely to recognize Tom's step as correct but might be confused by Katie's.
  - A: 70% 
  - B: 15% 
  - C: 5% 
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of algebraic methods and are less likely to be misled by incorrect manipulations.
  - A: 90% 
  - B: 5% 
  - C: 0% 
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the algebra but can also critically evaluate the steps given.
  - A: 95% 
  - B: 0% 
  - C: 0% 
  - D: 5%

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
