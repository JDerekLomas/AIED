To solve this, let's first understand the concept of reflecting a point across the line \(y = x\). When a point \((x, y)\) is reflected across the line \(y = x\), its new coordinates become \((y, x)\). This is because the line \(y = x\) acts as a mirror, swapping the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates of any point reflected across it.

Given that point \(P\) is at \((2, 1)\), reflecting \(P\) across the line \(y = x\) would change its coordinates to \((1, 2)\).

Now, let's analyze the question and predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic coordinate geometry and reflection concepts. They might not understand that reflecting across \(y = x\) means swapping the coordinates.
  - A: \( (2,2) \) - This could be a guess or a result of adding 1 to both coordinates, not understanding the reflection.
  - B: \( (2,0) \) - This might result from subtracting 1 from the y-coordinate, not understanding the reflection concept.
  - C: \( (0,1) \) - This could result from subtracting 2 from the x-coordinate, showing confusion.
  - D: \( (1,2) \) - This is the correct answer, but below-basic students might not get it.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic concepts but might make simple errors.
  - A: \( (2,2) \) - Could be a mistake thinking to add 1 to the y-coordinate.
  - B: \( (2,0) \) - Might come from incorrectly applying a transformation.
  - C: \( (0,1) \) - Could be a misinterpretation of the reflection line's effect.
  - D: \( (1,2) \) - This should be within their grasp if they understand \(y = x\) reflection.

- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand the concepts well and are less likely to make careless errors.
  - A: \( (2,2) \) - Unlikely, as they should know the reflection rule.
  - B: \( (2,0) \) - Unlikely, for the same reason.
  - C: \( (0,1) \) - Unlikely, as they should understand coordinate swapping.
  - D: \( (1,2) \) - Correct answer, likely to be chosen.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately and efficiently.
  - A: \( (2,2) \) - Very unlikely.
  - B: \( (2,0) \) - Very unlikely.
  - C: \( (0,1) \) - Very unlikely.
  - D: \( (1,2) \) - Almost certainly the chosen answer.

Given these considerations, here's a rough estimate:

- **Below Basic**: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic**: A=15% B=10% C=15% D=60%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

So, in the exact format requested:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=15% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
