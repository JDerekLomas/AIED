To approach this question, let's analyze the definitions and common misconceptions related to polygons. A polygon is defined as a 2D shape with at least three sides, where all the sides are straight. This definition is crucial for understanding the correct answer.

## Step 1: Understanding Polygons
A polygon must have straight sides and at least three sides. Examples include triangles, quadrilaterals, and pentagons.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom claims that a triangle is a polygon. By definition, a triangle has three straight sides, making it a polygon. Therefore, Tom is correct.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie claims that a semi-circle is a polygon. A semi-circle has one curved side and one straight side, not meeting the criteria of having all straight sides. Therefore, Katie is incorrect.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the definition of a polygon or might be confused by the shapes presented. They might incorrectly identify a semi-circle as a polygon due to lack of understanding, leading to B=40% (Only Katie), C=20% (Both), and D=20% (Neither), with A=20% (Only Tom).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of polygons but might still struggle with nuanced definitions. They are likely to get Tom's statement right but might be tricked into thinking a semi-circle could be considered a polygon due to its simplicity. So, A=60% (Only Tom), B=20% (Only Katie), C=10% (Both), and D=10% (Neither).
- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of the polygon definition. They will correctly identify Tom's shape as a polygon and Katie's as not. However, some might still be tempted by the simplicity of the shapes, but overall, A=80% (Only Tom), B=5% (Only Katie), C=5% (Both), and D=10% (Neither).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the definition but can also apply it accurately to various shapes. They are less likely to be misled by the question. Thus, A=90% (Only Tom), B=5% (Only Katie), C=0% (Both), and D=5% (Neither).

## 5: Concluding Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
- **basic**: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
- **advanced**: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
