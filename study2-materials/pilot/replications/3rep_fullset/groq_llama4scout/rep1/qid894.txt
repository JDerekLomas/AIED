## Step 1: Understand the question and the formula for the area of a triangle
The area \(A\) of a triangle is given by the formula \(A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\). In this question, the area \(A = 36 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\), the height is \(12 \mathrm{~cm}\), and the base is labelled as \(p\). We need to solve for \(p\).

## 2: Apply the area formula to solve for \(p\)
Given \(A = 36 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\) and height \(= 12 \mathrm{~cm}\), we substitute these into the formula:
\[36 = \frac{1}{2} \times p \times 12\]
Simplifying:
\[36 = 6p\]
Solving for \(p\):
\[p = 6\]

## 3: Analyze the potential for misconceptions or errors
The question might seem straightforward, but let's consider common misconceptions:
- Some students might forget the formula for the area of a triangle or misapply it.
- Others might incorrectly solve the equation.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
### below_basic
