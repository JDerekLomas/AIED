To solve this, let's analyze the positions of triangles P and Q and the lines of reflection A, B, and C.

## Step 1: Determine the coordinates of the vertices of triangles P and Q.
- Triangle P has vertices at (0,4), (2,3), and (2,5) if we consider the bottom left corner of the grid as (0,0).
- Triangle Q has vertices at (6,3), (6,5), and (8,4).

## 2: Find the line of reflection between P and Q.
To reflect a point over a vertical line, we change the sign of the horizontal distance of the point from the line of reflection. The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting corresponding points on P and Q.

## 3: Calculate the midpoint between corresponding vertices of P and Q.
- The midpoint between (0,4) and (6,3) is ((0+6)/2, (4+3)/2) = (3, 3.5).
- The midpoint between (2,3) and (6,5) is ((2+6)/2, (3+5)/2) = (4, 4).
- The midpoint between (2,5) and (8,4) is ((2+8)/2, (5+4)/2) = (5, 4.5).

## 4: Determine the x-coordinate of the line of reflection.
The x-coordinates of these midpoints are 3, 4, and 5. The line of reflection must be at the same vertical distance from these points. The average of these x-coordinates is (3 + 4 + 5) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4.

## 5: Identify the line of reflection from the given options.
- Line A is 2 squares to the right of the left-hand side, so its x-coordinate is 2.
- Line B is 4 squares to the right of the left-hand side, so its x-coordinate is 4.
- Line C is 5 squares to the right of the left-hand side, so its x-coordinate is 5.

## 6: Conclusion
Given that the line of reflection corresponds to an x-coordinate of 4, this matches line B.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with coordinate geometry and reflections. They might not understand how to find the line of reflection or might confuse the process. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, possibly scattered across A, C, or D. A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make calculation errors or misunderstand the concept of reflection. They might lean towards A or C due to miscalculation or not fully understanding the grid. A=25% B=40% C=25% D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand reflections and can apply them. They should correctly identify line B with minimal error. A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the concept but can also apply it accurately and quickly. They might double-check their answers but are likely to get it right. A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=40% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
