## Step 1: Understand the question and the potential pitfalls.
The question asks students to factorize the quadratic expression \(p^{2}+5p+4\). A common misconception in factorizing quadratics is not properly identifying the factors of the constant term that add up to the coefficient of the linear term.

## 2: Identify the correct factorization.
To factorize \(p^{2}+5p+4\), we need to find two numbers that multiply to 4 and add up to 5. These numbers are 1 and 4 because \(1 \times 4 = 4\) and \(1 + 4 = 5\). Therefore, the correct factorization is \((p+1)(p+4)\).

## 3: Analyze option A.
Option A is \((p+2)(p+3)\). If we multiply this out, we get \(p^{2}+3p+2p+6 = p^{2}+5p+6\), which does not match the given expression. So, option A is incorrect.

## 4: Analyze option B.
Option B is \((p+1)(p+5)\). Multiplying this out gives \(p^{2}+5p+p+5 = p^{2}+6p+5\), which also does not match. So, option B is incorrect.

## 5: Analyze option C.
Option C is \((p+1)(p+4)\), which we've identified as the correct factorization.

## 6: Analyze option D.
Option D states that the expression does not factorize. However, since we've found that \((p+1)(p+4)\) is a valid factorization, option D is incorrect.

## 7: Consider student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and factorizations. They might incorrectly choose A or B due to a lack of understanding of how to factorize or might choose D if they believe it cannot be factorized.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should have a grasp of simple factorizations. They might still make mistakes, especially if they are not confident in their ability to factorize quadratics. They could choose A, B, or D, but a significant portion should recognize the correct factorization.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should be able to factorize quadratics with ease. They should predominantly choose C, with a small percentage possibly choosing A or B due to careless mistakes.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong understanding of algebra, including factorization. They should almost exclusively choose C, with very few errors.

## 8: Estimate percentages for each ability level.
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (common mistake), B=20% (another plausible mistake), C=20% (some might get it right by chance or partial understanding), D=30% (lack of understanding).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=15%, C=60% (most should get it right with some effort), D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=90% (most get it right), D=0%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=100% (all get it right), D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
