To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential difficulties it presents.

The question involves reflecting a rectangle across a horizontal line and determining where a marked corner ends up. The grid provided helps to visualize the positions and distances. The marked corner of the rectangle is at the bottom left, and we need to reflect it across the red horizontal line.

## Step 1: Understanding the Reflection
When reflecting a point across a line, we find its mirror image on the opposite side of the line. The distance of the point from the line is the same as the distance of its image from the line, but in the opposite direction.

## 2: Identifying Key Features
- The red line is 3 squares up from the bottom of the grid.
- The rectangle's bottom edge is 1 square down from the red line, meaning its bottom edge is 2 squares up from the bottom of the grid.
- The marked corner (bottom left of the rectangle) is on this line, 2 squares up from the bottom.

## 3: Determining the Reflected Point
Since the marked corner is 2 squares up from the bottom, and the red line (the line of reflection) is 3 squares up from the bottom, the marked corner is 1 square below the red line. When reflected across the red line, it will be 1 square above the red line.

## 4: Locating the Reflected Corner
Given the rectangle's position and that it's 3 squares wide and 2 squares high, the marked corner, when reflected, will not change its horizontal position but will change its vertical position to be 1 square above the red line. The original marked corner is directly below the red line, so after reflection, it will be directly above the red line.

## 5: Analyzing the Options
- Option A is 3 squares above the red line.
- Option B is 2 squares above the red line.
- Option C is 1 square above the red line.
- Option D is 6 squares along from the tiny blue circle and 3 squares above the red line.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students might struggle with visualizing the reflection or understanding the grid. They might incorrectly assume the reflection goes to the opposite side of the grid or misinterpret the distances. Expect a spread across options but with a tendency towards A or D due to confusion about distances or directions.
- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a basic understanding of reflection but might make errors in measuring distances or applying the concept correctly. They are likely to choose C, as it correctly represents a point above the line of reflection without overcomplicating the movement.
- **Proficient:** These students should accurately reflect the point across the line, recognizing it moves from below to above the line without changing horizontal position. Thus, they should predominantly choose C.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are likely to quickly and accurately determine the correct position, choosing C, as they have a strong understanding of geometric transformations.

## 7: Estimating Percentages
Given the clarity of the question and the grid, even lower-ability students can visualize the reflection. However, the accuracy of their responses will vary:
- **Below Basic:** A=20%, B=15%, C=40%, D=25% (Some struggle with basic concepts, leading to scattered answers)
- **Basic:** A=5%, B=10%, C=70%, D=15% (Most understand basic reflection)
- **Proficient:** A=2%, B=5%, C=90%, D=3% (Accurate application of reflection concept)
- **Advanced:** A=1%, B=2%, C=95%, D=2% (High accuracy with complex concepts)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=70% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2%
