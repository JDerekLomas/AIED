## Step 1: Understand the question and the options provided
The question asks students to simplify the given algebraic expression: \(\frac{(x+3)(x+5)}{(x+3)(x+10)}\). The options provided are: A) \( \frac{x+1}{x+2} \), B) \( \frac{x+5}{x+10} \), C) \( \frac{x^{2}+8 x+15}{x^{2}+13 x+30} \), and D) \( \frac{1}{2} \).

## 2: Identify the correct simplification process
To simplify the given expression, one should cancel out the common factor \((x+3)\) from both the numerator and the denominator, yielding \( \frac{x+5}{x+10} \). This corresponds to option B.

## 3: Consider common misconceptions and errors
A common misconception might involve not recognizing that \((x+3)\) can be canceled out, or incorrectly simplifying the expression. However, the structure of this question, with \((x+3)\) clearly present in both numerator and denominator, makes the correct simplification straightforward for students who understand basic algebraic manipulation.

## 4: Analyze the difficulty level for different ability groups
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and may not recognize the \((x+3)\) as a common factor to cancel out. They might choose option C, as it directly reflects the given expression without attempting to simplify, or they might incorrectly simplify. Option A seems unlikely as it doesn't relate to the original expression's structure. Option D seems incorrect as there's no indication that the expression simplifies to a constant.

- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to identify and cancel common factors. However, they might be tempted to choose option C if they're unsure about how to simplify or if they think they need to expand and then simplify. Option B seems likely for those confident in their algebraic skills.

- **Proficient**: Students at this level should easily recognize the common factor and cancel it out, leading them to choose option B. They are less likely to select option C or A, as these represent incorrect or no simplification.

- **Advanced**: These students not only simplify correctly but also understand that the expression simplifies under the assumption that \(x \neq -3\) (to avoid division by zero). They will likely choose option B without hesitation.

## 5: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option at different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: A=10% (some might mistakenly try to simplify in a way that resembles A), B=20% (if they partially understand simplification), C=60% (direct copy or no simplification), D=10% (unlikely, but some might guess).
- **Basic**: A=5%, B=70%, C=20%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=2%, B=90%, C=5%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: A=1%, B=95%, C=3%, D=1%.

## 6: Format the estimates according to the question
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=70% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=90% C=5% D=3%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=3% D=1%
