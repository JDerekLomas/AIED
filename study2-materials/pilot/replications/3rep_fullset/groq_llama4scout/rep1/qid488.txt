To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( (-3)+(-5)= \), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to adding negative numbers.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to add two negative numbers, \( -3 \) and \( -5 \). The correct answer involves understanding that adding two negative numbers results in a more negative number, which means the sum will be negative.

## 2: Identifying Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to think that adding two negative numbers could result in a positive number or to ignore the signs and just add the numbers. However, the question does not directly test the misconception of changing the operation (e.g., thinking it becomes subtraction), as the operation is clearly stated.

## 3: Analyzing Possible Errors
- Option A (\( 2 \)) and Option C (\( 8 \)) suggest a misunderstanding of how negative numbers add together, possibly thinking that two negatives make a positive or ignoring the negative signs altogether.
- Option B (\( -2 \)) might seem plausible to some students who incorrectly apply a rule or make a calculation error, thinking perhaps \(-3 - 5 = -2\) or similar.
- Option D (\( -8 \)) is the correct answer, as \( -3 + (-5) = -3 - 5 = -8 \).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle significantly with negative numbers. They might choose A (\( 2 \)) or C (\( 8 \)) due to a lack of understanding that adding two negatives gives a negative. B (\( -2 \)) could also be a choice due to confusion. D (\( -8 \)) might be challenging for them to arrive at correctly.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors. They are likely to understand that adding two negatives gives a negative but might struggle with the calculation, possibly choosing B (\( -2 \)) or C (\( 8 \)) due to arithmetic mistakes.
- **Proficient**: These students should have a solid grasp of adding negative numbers. They are less likely to choose A (\( 2 \)) or C (\( 8 \)), and B (\( -2 \)) might still be a trap. D (\( -8 \)) should be within their reach.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should easily recognize the correct operation and calculation, making D (\( -8 \)) the obvious choice. Errors should be minimal.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (misconception of positives), B=20% (random or incorrect calculation), C=30% (similar misconception), D=20% (some get it right).
- **Basic**: A=15%, B=25% (common mistake), C=10%, D=50%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=10%, C=5%, D=80%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=25% C=10% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
