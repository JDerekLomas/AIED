To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the task and the potential difficulties students might face.

The task involves reflecting a rectangle across a horizontal line. This requires an understanding of reflection in geometry. A common misconception in geometry is not understanding how reflections work, particularly across different axes (horizontal, vertical). 

The question provides a visual representation of a rectangle with one corner marked (with a blue circle) and asks students to determine where this marked corner would end up if the rectangle were reflected across a given horizontal line.

## Step 1: Understanding the Reflection Process
To reflect a point across a horizontal line, one must imagine or graphically represent the point being flipped over that line. For a point above the line, its reflection will be below the line, and vice versa, with the same horizontal distance from the line of reflection.

## 2: Analyzing the Given Diagram
The marked corner of the rectangle is at the top left. If this rectangle is reflected across the horizontal line provided, the marked corner will move from being above the line to being below it but will retain its left-right positioning relative to the line of reflection.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding or visualizing geometric transformations. They might choose an answer randomly or based on a superficial understanding of the transformation. Given the visual cues, a significant portion might incorrectly choose A (20-30%), thinking the point stays in the same position or moves up, B (20-30%), not fully grasping the reflection concept, C (30-40%), as it is directly below the original position, or D (10-20%), as it seems less likely given the horizontal reflection.

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding of geometry but might still make simple mistakes. They are more likely to understand the concept of reflection but might struggle with applying it correctly. A significant portion might choose C (50-60%), as it's directly below and seems to align with a basic understanding of reflection across a horizontal axis. A (10-20%), B (10-20%), and D (10-20%) might also be chosen due to misunderstanding the reflection.

- **Proficient:** Students at this level should have a solid understanding of geometric transformations, including reflections. They should accurately determine that the marked corner, when reflected across the horizontal line, ends up below it. Thus, a high percentage should choose C (80-90%), with minimal choices for A, B, or D.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concept of reflection but can also apply it accurately in various contexts. They should have no trouble identifying the correct position of the reflected point. Therefore, nearly all should choose C (95-100%), with virtually no incorrect responses.

Based on the steps and analysis, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=98% D=2%
