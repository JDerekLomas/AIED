To approach this question, let's first analyze the statements given about a triangle with angles \( 90^{\circ}, 45^{\circ}, 45^{\circ} \).

1. **Statement 1: It must be a right-angled triangle.** A right-angled triangle has one angle that is \( 90^{\circ} \). Since one of the angles given is \( 90^{\circ} \), this statement is true.

2. **Statement 2: It must be an isosceles triangle.** An isosceles triangle has at least two sides of equal length, which also means at least two angles are equal. Given that two of the angles are \( 45^{\circ} \), this statement is also true.

Given that both statements are true, the correct answer is **C) Both statements**.

Now, let's consider how students at different ability levels might respond:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic geometric definitions or have difficulty applying them. However, the question provides the angles, making it straightforward to verify both statements. Still, they might be more prone to errors due to lack of understanding. 
  - A: \( 40\% \) (recognize right angle)
  - B: \( 30\% \) (recognize isosceles but not necessarily right angle)
  - C: \( 20\% \) (understand both, but less likely due to potential confusion)
  - D: \( 10\% \) (reject both, indicating a significant misunderstanding)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding and are more likely to correctly identify basic properties of triangles.
  - A: \( 20\% \) 
  - B: \( 20\% \) 
  - C: \( 60\% \) (most will understand both statements are true)
  - D: \( 0\% \) (unlikely to reject both correct statements)

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of geometric concepts and are less likely to make errors on straightforward questions like this.
  - A: \( 5\% \) 
  - B: \( 5\% \) 
  - C: \( 90\% \) (clear understanding of both properties)
  - D: \( 0\% \) 

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have an in-depth understanding and can apply concepts with ease. They are unlikely to make errors on this question.
  - A: \( 0\% \) 
  - B: \( 0\% \) 
  - C: \( 100\% \) (no errors expected)
  - D: \( 0\% \) 

Therefore, the predictions are:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=60% D=0%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
