## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests.
The question presents a diagram with an arrow marked -24 and a smaller arrow underneath that is a third of the length of the larger arrow, pointing in the same direction. Tom writes \( -3 \times(-8)=-24 \) and Katie writes \( \frac{(-24)}{-3}=-8 \). The task is to determine who is correct based on the diagram.

## 2: Analyze Tom's calculation.
Tom's calculation is \( -3 \times(-8)=-24 \). The multiplication of two negative numbers results in a positive number, so \( -3 \times(-8) = 24 \), not -24. This indicates Tom is incorrect.

## 3: Analyze Katie's calculation.
Katie's calculation is \( \frac{(-24)}{-3}=-8 \). Dividing a negative number by another negative number results in a positive number, so \( \frac{(-24)}{-3} = 8 \), not -8. This indicates Katie is also incorrect.

## 4: Consider the diagram's implication.
The diagram shows a larger arrow with a value of -24 and a smaller arrow that is a third of the length of the larger one. If the smaller arrow represents -8 (being a third of -24), Katie's calculation \( \frac{-24}{-3} = 8 \) actually aligns with the concept that -24 divided by -3 equals 8, suggesting the smaller arrow is indeed 8 units. However, Katie wrote -8, which is incorrect based on the division.

## 5: Determine the correctness of each student's statement based on mathematical rules.
Given the standard rules of arithmetic:
- Tom is incorrect because \( -3 \times -8 = 24 \), not -24.
- Katie is incorrect because \( \frac{-24}{-3} = 8 \), not -8.

## 6: Assess the likelihood of students choosing each option based on ability level.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic operations and negative numbers. They might incorrectly validate Tom or Katie due to a lack of understanding of negative number operations. A=30% (incorrectly thinking Tom is right), B=30% (incorrectly thinking Katie is right), C=10% (thinking both are correct, showing a lack of understanding), D=30% (correctly identifying neither is correct but for possibly wrong reasons).
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors with negative numbers. A=20%, B=20%, C=5%, D=55%.
- **Proficient:** These students understand negative number operations well. They are less likely to fall for misconceptions. A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts accurately. A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

## 7: Convert assessments into the required format.
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=30% B=30% C=10% D=30%
- **basic:** A=20% B=20% C=5% D=55%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=5% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
