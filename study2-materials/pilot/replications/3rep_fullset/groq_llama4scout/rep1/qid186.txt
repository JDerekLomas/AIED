To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question on writing the number "Fifty-six thousand and thirteen" in digits, let's analyze the potential misconceptions and the clarity of the question.

The question requires students to understand place value, specifically the representation of thousands and units in a written number. The correct answer is \(56013\), which translates directly from "Fifty-six thousand and thirteen."

- **A (\(5613\))**: This option suggests a misunderstanding where the thousand part is not correctly represented, possibly due to not adequately accounting for the "thousand" part or misinterpreting the place value.
- **B (\(56030\))**: This option indicates confusion with the placement of the "thirteen" part, possibly suggesting an incorrect addition or misunderstanding of how to represent numbers with multiple parts (thousands and units).
- **C (\(56013\))**: This is the correct representation of "Fifty-six thousand and thirteen," showing a proper understanding of thousands and units.
- **D (\(560013\))**: This option may result from over-specifying the thousand part or incorrectly interpreting the given number, thinking it implies an additional zero.

Given these considerations:

### below_basic:
At this level, students are likely to struggle with understanding and representing numbers in the thousands accurately. 
- A (\(5613\)): 40% (may not understand "thousand")
- B (\(56030\)): 20% (confusion with the units part)
- C (\(56013\)): 20% (some understanding but easily confused)
- D (\(560013\)): 20% (misunderstanding of how to express thousands)

### basic:
Students at this level have a basic grasp of numbers and place value but may still make errors.
- A (\(5613\)): 20% (common mistake not separating thousand and unit correctly)
- B (\(56030\)): 10% (understanding of thousand but error in unit representation)
- C (\(56013\)): 60% (correct understanding and representation)
- D (\(560013\)): 10% (over-specification or confusion)

### proficient:
Students here have a solid understanding of place value and are less likely to make basic errors.
- A (\(5613\)): 5% (rarely make such oversight)
- B (\(56030\)): 5% (understanding there but precise representation lacking)
- C (\(56013\)): 85% (accurately represent the given number)
- D (\(560013\)): 5% (unusual error for this level)

### advanced:
At this level, students have a thorough grasp of mathematical concepts, including place value.
- A (\(5613\)): 0% (unlikely to make this mistake)
- B (\(56030\)): 0% (clearly understand thousand and unit separation)
- C (\(56013\)): 95% (high accuracy in representation)
- D (\(560013\)): 5% (almost certainly not a misunderstanding but possibly a slip)

Based on the analysis:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
