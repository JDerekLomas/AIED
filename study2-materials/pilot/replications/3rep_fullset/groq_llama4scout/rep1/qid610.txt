To approach this question, let's analyze each option in terms of its potential to have real solutions, focusing on the structure of the equations provided:

## Step 1: Understand the condition for real solutions
A quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) has real solutions if and only if its discriminant \(D = b^2 - 4ac \geq 0\). For equations in the form of \((w+5)^2 + k = 0\) or \((w+5)^2 - k = 0\), we can easily determine the existence of real solutions by checking if \((w+5)^2\) can be equal to \(-k\) or \(k\), respectively.

## 2: Analyze option A
Option A: \((w+5)^2 + 25 = 0\). This implies \((w+5)^2 = -25\). Since \((w+5)^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(w\), there are no real solutions for \(w\).

## 3: Analyze option B
Option B: \((w+5)^2 - 25 = 0\). This implies \((w+5)^2 = 25\), which has real solutions \(w+5 = \pm5\), so \(w = 0\) or \(w = -10\).

## 4: Analyze option C
Option C: \((w+5)^2 - 5 = 0\). This implies \((w+5)^2 = 5\), which has real solutions \(w+5 = \pm\sqrt{5}\), so \(w = -5 \pm \sqrt{5}\).

## 5: Analyze option D
Option D: \((w+5)^2 = 0\). This implies \(w+5 = 0\), so \(w = -5\), which is a real solution.

## 6: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and understanding of quadratic equations. They might incorrectly assume all equations have solutions or make errors in simple algebraic manipulations. Option A seems unlikely to be identified as having no real solutions because it requires understanding that a square cannot be negative. Expect a higher chance of incorrect answers, particularly for A, B, C, and D, with potentially A being less recognized as "no real solutions" due to its obvious negativity.

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of quadratic equations and might recognize that a squared term is always non-negative. They might still struggle with the implications of adding or subtracting a constant. Option A should be identifiable as having no real solutions because \((w+5)^2\) cannot be \(-25\). 

- **Proficient**: Proficient students should easily recognize that option A has no real solutions because the square of any real number is non-negative, and adding 25 ensures it's always positive.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the concept but can quickly evaluate each option. They should have no trouble identifying option A as the one with no real solutions.

## 7: Estimating percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=60% (mistakenly think it has solutions or don't understand), B=20%, C=10%, D=10% (simple solutions might be understood).
- **Basic**: A=40% (still some confusion), B=30%, C=15%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
