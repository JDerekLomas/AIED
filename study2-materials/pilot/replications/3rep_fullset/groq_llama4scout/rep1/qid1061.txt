## Step 1: Understand the sequence and its pattern
The given sequence is \(10, 21, 34, 49, 66, \ldots\). To find the pattern, let's calculate the differences between consecutive terms: \(21 - 10 = 11\), \(34 - 21 = 13\), \(49 - 34 = 15\), \(66 - 49 = 17\). The differences between terms are increasing by 2 each time (11, 13, 15, 17, ...), which indicates that the sequence is not arithmetic but could be quadratic.

## 2: Determine the nth-term rule
Given that the sequence suggests a quadratic relationship, the nth-term rule can be expressed as \(an^2 + bn + c\). For a sequence that is quadratic, the second differences are constant, which is the case here (the differences between the terms are increasing by 2 each time).

## 3: Analyze the given nth-term rule format
The nth-term rule given is \(n^2 \triangle n + \square\). To match the sequence provided, we need to find \(\triangle\) and \(\square\). 

## 4: Solve for \(\triangle\) and \(\square\)
Let's assume the first term (\(n=1\)) is 10: \(1^2 \triangle(1) + \square = 10\), which simplifies to \(\triangle + \square = 10\).

For \(n=2\), the term is 21: \(2^2 \triangle(2) + \square = 21\), which simplifies to \(4\triangle + 2\square = 21\).

## 5: Solve the system of equations
From \(\triangle + \square = 10\), we can express \(\square = 10 - \triangle\).

Substituting into \(4\triangle + 2\square = 21\): \(4\triangle + 2(10 - \triangle) = 21\), which simplifies to \(4\triangle + 20 - 2\triangle = 21\), then \(2\triangle = 1\), and \(\triangle = 0.5\).

## 6: Calculate \(\square\)
Given \(\triangle = 0.5\), then \(\square = 10 - 0.5 = 9.5\).

## 7: Compare with given options
The value of \(\triangle = 0.5\) which can also be written as \(5.5\) is not correct, it's actually \(0.5\) or \(\frac{1}{2}\) which matches with \(+1\) or \(+0.5n\) implying \(\triangle = 0.5\). Let's correctly interpret the options with this in mind:
- A: \(5.5\) seems to misunderstand \(\triangle\); it could refer to \(5.5 = \frac{11}{2}\), not directly matching our \(\triangle = 0.5\).
- B: \(-8\) does not match.
- C: \(+1\) could imply adding 1, not directly related to our calculated \(\triangle\).
- D: \(+8\) does not match.

## 8: Consider student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Might struggle to see the pattern or calculate \(\triangle\), likely to guess or pick an option that seems simple, such as A or D.
- **Basic**: May understand the sequence increases but struggle with deriving \(\triangle\), possibly confusing it with common sequence patterns, leading to random or simple guesses.
- **Proficient**: Should recognize the quadratic nature and potentially derive or closely estimate \(\triangle\), less likely to choose incorrect options without calculation.
- **Advanced**: Would likely derive \(\triangle\) accurately and choose the correct form, possibly recognizing \(\triangle = 0.5\) or its equivalent.

## 9: Estimate percentages for each option
Given \(\triangle = 0.5\), which matches option A if considering \(5.5\) as a misinterpretation or incorrect calculation:
- **Below_basic**: A=30% (misinterpretation), B=20% (random), C=20% (simple addition), D=30% (another simple guess).
- **Basic**: A=25% (easy guess), B=15% (not understanding), C=30% (thinking addition), D=30%.
- **Proficient**: A=10% (miscalculation), B=5% (understanding but wrong), C=40% (seeing \(+1\)), D=45% (correct understanding of sequence).
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=0%, C=10%, D=85%.

The best answer is below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=40% D=45%
advanced: A=5%
