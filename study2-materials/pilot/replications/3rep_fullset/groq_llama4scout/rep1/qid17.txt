To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the options provided.

The question asks for part of the proof that the sum of two odd numbers is even. The correct proof involves representing two odd numbers as \(2n - 1\) and \(2m + 1\) (or similar forms), adding them, and showing the result is even.

## Option Analysis

- **Option A**: \( \begin{array}{l}2 n+(2 m+1) \\ =2(n+m)+1\end{array} \) - This option incorrectly represents the sum of an even and an odd number, not two odd numbers, and does not prove the statement.
  
- **Option B**: \( \begin{array}{l}(2 n-1)(2 m+1) \\ =4 m n+2 n-2 m-1 \\ =2(2 m n-n-m)+1\end{array} \) - This option shows the product of two odd numbers, not their sum, and results in an odd number, which is not relevant to the question.

- **Option C**: \( \begin{array}{l}\text { Odd + Odd } \\ =\text { even }\end{array} \) - This option simply states the fact to be proven without providing a proof.

- **Option D**: \( \begin{array}{l}(2 n-1)+(2 m+1) \\ =2 n+2 m \\ =2(n+m)\end{array} \) - This option correctly represents the sum of two odd numbers and shows it results in an even number, fitting the form of \(2k\) where \(k\) is an integer.

## Predicting Student Responses

### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with algebraic manipulations and understanding proofs.
- A: 20% (some might see an equation and think it's relevant)
- B: 15% (seen as complex but might be chosen due to its algebraic appearance)
- C: 40% (simple and directly addresses the question without requiring algebraic manipulation)
- D: 25% (some might understand the basic concept of odd + odd = even but struggle with the algebra)

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra and might recognize simple proofs.
- A: 10% (less likely as they might notice it's not purely about odd + odd)
- B: 10% (seen as complex and not directly relevant)
- C: 30% (still a straightforward statement but might not be seen as a "proof")
- D: 50% (understand the algebra and see it as a correct proof)

### proficient
These students are comfortable with algebra and can follow simple proofs.
- A: 5% (unlikely as they understand the algebraic representation)
- B: 5% (recognize it's about the product, not sum)
- C: 10% (might see this as too simplistic for a proof)
- D: 80% (clearly see this as a correct algebraic proof)

### advanced
At this level, students have a deep understanding of algebraic proofs and can quickly identify correct representations.
- A: 0% (immediately see it's not relevant)
- B: 0% (recognize it's the product of two odd numbers)
- C: 0% (understand that stating the fact doesn't constitute a proof)
- D: 100% (no doubt that this is a correct proof)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=30% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
