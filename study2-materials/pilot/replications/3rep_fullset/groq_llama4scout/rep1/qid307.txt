## Step 1: Understanding the Sequence and the Question
The sequence is given by \(3n + 1\), and Eliza is trying to determine if \(82\) is a term in this sequence. She solves the equation \(3n + 1 = 82\) to find \(n\).

## 2: Analyzing Eliza's Working Out
Eliza's working out is as follows:
\(3n + 1 = 82\)
\(3n = 81\)
\(n = 27\)
This means that if \(n = 27\), then \(3n + 1 = 3(27) + 1 = 82\). So, \(82\) is indeed a term in the sequence, and it is the \(27^{\text{th}}\) term.

## 3: Evaluating the Answer Choices
- A: \(82\) is in the sequence and is the \(27^{\text{th}}\) term. This matches Eliza's calculation.
- B: \(27\) is in the sequence and is the \(82^{\text{nd}}\) term. This is incorrect based on Eliza's calculation; \(27\) is the term number, not the term value.
- C: \(82\) is not in the sequence because \(27\) is an integer. This is incorrect because finding \(n = 27\) as an integer actually confirms \(82\) is in the sequence.
- D: Eliza's method does not answer this question. This is incorrect because Eliza's method directly answers whether \(82\) is in the sequence.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations or understanding the sequence. They might not fully comprehend Eliza's working or its implications. A=60% (since they might see the direct calculation and think it's correct), B=20% (misinterpreting the role of \(n\)), C=10% (incorrectly concluding based on \(n\) being an integer), D=10% (not understanding the method's validity).
- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp of algebra but might still be prone to simple mistakes. A=80% (recognizing \(82\) as a term), B=10% (some might confuse \(n\) with the term), C=5% (a few might mistakenly think \(n\) being an integer negates \(82\) being in the sequence), D=5% (a few might question the method but it's straightforward).
- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to understand the sequence and algebraic manipulations accurately. A=95% (clearly understanding \(82\) is the \(27^{\text{th}}\) term), B=3% (rarely might confuse), C=1% (unlikely to make this mistake), D=1% (method is clear and correct).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will have a deep understanding, and for them, the question is straightforward. A=99% (no issues with understanding), B=0.5% (extremely rare mistake), C=0.25% (very unlikely), D=0.25% (method's correctness is obvious).

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **basic**: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
- **advanced**: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%
