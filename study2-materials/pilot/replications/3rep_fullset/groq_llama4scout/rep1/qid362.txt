To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about finding the gradient of the line given by \(4x + 3y = 5\), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or challenges students might face.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to find the gradient of a line given in the general form of a linear equation, \(Ax + By = C\). The gradient (\(m\)) of a line in this form can be found by rearranging the equation into the slope-intercept form, \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the gradient.

## 2: Rearranging the Equation
To find the gradient, the equation \(4x + 3y = 5\) needs to be rearranged to solve for \(y\). This yields \(3y = -4x + 5\), and then \(y = -\frac{4}{3}x + \frac{5}{3}\). From this, it's clear that the gradient (\(m\)) is \(-\frac{4}{3}\).

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the coefficients or not properly rearranging the equation. For instance, some students might mistakenly think the gradient is the coefficient of \(x\) without considering the coefficient of \(y\) or might incorrectly apply the formula for gradient.

## 4: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A: \(-4\) suggests a misunderstanding of how to extract the gradient from the given equation.
- Option B: \(4\) is a positive value and does not match the gradient of the given line.
- Option C: \(-\frac{4}{3}\) is the correct gradient.
- Option D: \(\frac{4}{3}\) suggests a mistake in the sign of the gradient.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulation and understanding of the gradient concept. They might choose A or B due to a lack of understanding of how to rearrange the equation or identify the gradient. Some might choose D due to a sign error. C = 20%, A = 40%, B = 30%, D = 10%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in algebraic manipulation or identifying components of the equation. They are more likely to choose C but might still be tempted by A or B. C = 50%, A = 25%, B = 20%, D = 5%.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of linear equations and gradients. They are likely to choose C correctly but might make occasional errors. C = 80%, A = 10%, B = 5%, D = 5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and are less likely to make errors. They will mostly choose C. C = 95%, A = 2%, B = 2%, D = 1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
