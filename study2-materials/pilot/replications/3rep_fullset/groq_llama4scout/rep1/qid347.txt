To solve this, let's consider the structure of the question and the common misconceptions associated with the formula for displacement, which is \( s = \frac{1}{2}(u + v)t \) for uniformly accelerated motion.

## Step 1: Understand the Formula
The correct formula for displacement when initial velocity \(u\), final velocity \(v\), and time \(t\) are given is \( s = \frac{1}{2}(u + v)t \). This formula is derived from the equations of motion and assumes constant acceleration.

## 2: Identify Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve misapplying the formula or confusing it with other equations of motion, such as \(s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2\) or \(v = u + at\). Students might also incorrectly add or average velocities and times without proper consideration of the formulae.

## 3: Analyze the Options
- Option A: \( s = \frac{1}{2}(2.9 + 3.5) \times 5.2 \) seems to correctly apply the formula.
- Option B: \( s = \frac{1}{2}(2.9 + 3.5 + 5.2) \) incorrectly adds the time into the average velocity calculation.
- Option C: \( s = 2.9 + 3.5 + (\frac{1}{2} \times 5.2) \) incorrectly separates the calculation into parts that don't correspond to any standard formula.
- Option D: This option is actually the correct application of the formula: \( s = \frac{1}{2}(2.9 + 3.5) \times 5.2 \).

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with any form of the equation and are likely to make significant errors. They might choose B or C due to misunderstanding the formula entirely.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the basic structure but could easily be misled by incorrect formulations. They might choose A or D if they recognize the correct formula but could also select B or C due to confusion.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to recognize and correctly apply the formula, thus choosing D.
- **Advanced**: Similar to proficient students, they would likely choose D but might also be able to derive the formula if needed.

## 5: Estimate Percentages
Given the specific question and assuming most students have seen the formula \( s = \frac{1}{2}(u + v)t \):
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (guessing), B=30% (misunderstanding the formula), C=20% (incorrect addition), D=30% (some might get it right by chance or partial understanding).
- **Basic**: A=10% (error in calculation), B=20% (adding time incorrectly), C=10% (misunderstanding), D=60% (correct application).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (minor calculation error), B=5% (mistake), C=5% (another mistake), D=85% (correct).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (unlikely to make a simple error), B=0% (understands the formula), C=0% (unlikely), D=100% (correct application expected).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=10% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
