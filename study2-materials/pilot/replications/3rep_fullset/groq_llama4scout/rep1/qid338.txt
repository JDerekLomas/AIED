To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions that could lead students to choose incorrect options.

The question requires students to find an equivalent fraction for \( \frac{4}{6} \) with a denominator of 12. This involves understanding the concept of equivalent fractions, which can be achieved by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same non-zero number.

## Step 1: Understanding the Concept of Equivalent Fractions
To get from \( \frac{4}{6} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 12, students need to figure out what number multiplied by 6 equals 12. Since \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \), students should then multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2 to get an equivalent fraction.

## 2: Calculating the Equivalent Fraction
Applying the multiplication: \( \frac{4 \times 2}{6 \times 2} = \frac{8}{12} \). This means the correct completion of the statement \( \frac{4}{6}=\frac{}{12} \) is \( \frac{8}{12} \), which corresponds to option D.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
- Option A (\( \frac{2}{12} \)) might seem to result from a simple halving of \( \frac{4}{6} \), not considering the need to scale to a denominator of 12 properly.
- Option B (\( \frac{4}{12} \)) could result from a misunderstanding of how to scale the fraction, possibly thinking that just multiplying the numerator by 2 (or not adjusting it correctly) and keeping the denominator as is or not changing it proportionally.
- Option C (\( \frac{10}{12} \)) seems arbitrary and not a straightforward mistake from common fraction misconceptions.

## 4: Assessing Student Performance by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic fraction concepts. They could choose A, B, or C due to a lack of understanding of equivalent fractions. Given the simplicity of the question, a significant portion might still guess or choose randomly, but option D, being the correct answer, requires a basic understanding that might elude them. So, \( A=20\% \), \( B=30\% \), \( C=10\% \), \( D=40\% \).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and might apply simple multiplication factors. However, errors could still occur, especially if they misunderstand the scaling factor. They are more likely to get it right but could be tempted by B. So, \( A=10\% \), \( B=20\% \), \( C=5\% \), \( D=65\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students understand equivalent fractions well and can apply the scaling factor correctly. Mistakes here would be minimal, with the majority choosing D. So, \( A=5\% \), \( B=5\% \), \( C=0\% \), \( D=90\% \).
- **Advanced**: For advanced students, this question is straightforward. They are expected to get it right almost universally, with minimal chance of selecting incorrect options due to their deep understanding of fractions. So, \( A=0\% \), \( B=0\% \), \( C=0\% \), \( D=100\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=5% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
