## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to recall the method for factorising a quadratic equation of the form \(x^{2} + bx + c\), specifically for the equation \(x^{2} + 5x + 6\). The correct method involves finding two numbers that add to give \(b\) (in this case, 5) and multiply to give \(c\) (in this case, 6).

## 2: Identifying the Correct Option
The correct option should reflect that the two numbers needed to factorise \(x^{2} + 5x + 6\) must add to give 5 (the coefficient of \(x\)) and multiply to give 6 (the constant term). This matches option C: Add to give \(5\) and multiply to give \(6\).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to confuse the operations (addition and multiplication) with the wrong coefficients or to misinterpret the question. However, given the straightforward nature of the question and the fact that it directly tests a fundamental concept, the likelihood of students choosing incorrect options based on common misconceptions might be lower than expected.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and the concept of factorising. They might be more likely to choose an option that seems to directly involve the coefficients in a simple way, potentially leading to a higher percentage choosing A or B, as these directly mention the numbers involved in a straightforward manner.

- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding of algebra but might still be prone to simple errors or misunderstandings. They are likely to choose C, as it correctly states the requirement, but some might still opt for A due to confusion.

- **Proficient:** Students who are proficient in algebra will likely understand the concept well and choose C. They might see through the obvious incorrect options (A, B, and D) and select C as it accurately describes the process.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students will not only choose C but will do so with confidence, recognizing the incorrectness of the other options immediately.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the clarity of the question and the fundamental nature of the concept:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (misinterpreting the basic requirement), B=20% (confusing with \(6x\)), C=30% (getting it right by chance or basic understanding), D=10% (least likely due to its complexity).
- **Basic:** A=20%, B=10%, C=65%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=2%, C=92%, D=1%.
- **Advanced:** A=1%, B=0%, C=99%, D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=65% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=92% D=1%
advanced: A=1% B=0% C=99% D=0%
