## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the area of a parallelogram with a given base (7cm) and perpendicular height (3cm). The formula for the area of a parallelogram is base × height.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve using the slanted height (4cm) instead of the perpendicular height (3cm) in calculating the area. Another potential error could be misunderstanding the formula or miscalculating the product.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 21 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \) (which is \( 7 \times 3 \))
- Option B: \( 22 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \)
- Option C: \( 28 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \) (which is \( 7 \times 4 \))
- Option D: \( 84 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \) (which is \( 7 \times 12 \))

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the basic formula or be tempted to use incorrect numbers. They might choose B or D due to calculation errors or using wrong dimensions. A and C are based on correct applications of the formula but with correct and incorrect measurements respectively. So, below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
- **Basic:** Students here understand the basic concept but might be prone to errors if not careful. They are likely to choose A (correct answer) but some might choose C (using the wrong height). So, basic: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
- **Proficient:** These students are confident in their understanding. They should predominantly choose A. So, proficient: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and are less likely to make simple errors. They should almost all choose A. So, advanced: A=95% B=0% C=3% D=2%

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
- basic: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
- proficient: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
- advanced: A=95% B=0% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=3% D=2%
