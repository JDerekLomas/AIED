To approach this question, let's analyze what it's testing and how students at different levels might respond.

The question tests the understanding of inequalities, specifically \(x > -1\). This means \(x\) can be any number greater than \(-1\), not including \(-1\). The correct representation on a number line would have an open circle at \(-1\) (to indicate \(-1\) is not included) and an arrow pointing to the right (to indicate all numbers greater than \(-1\) are included).

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding inequalities and their representation on a number line. They might confuse the direction of the inequality or the meaning of an open versus a closed circle.
  - A: 20% (Some might recognize the open circle and correct direction but could be guessing.)
  - B: 30% (Might think \(-1\) is included because of the filled circle.)
  - C: 40% (Correct representation; might understand the concept but could also be guessing.)
  - D: 10% (Incorrect representation; filled circle means \(-1\) is included.)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless mistakes or have misconceptions about inequalities.
  - A: 10% (Recognize the open circle but incorrect direction.)
  - B: 20% (Filled circle suggests \(-1\) is included.)
  - C: 60% (Open circle and correct direction; understanding of \(x > -1\).)
  - D: 10% (Both incorrect: filled circle and wrong direction.)

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of inequalities and their graphical representations.
  - A: 5% (Careless mistake on direction.)
  - B: 5% (Filled circle is incorrect.)
  - C: 85% (Understand \(x > -1\) means an open circle at \(-1\) and arrow to the right.)
  - D: 5% (Two errors: filled circle and wrong direction.)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately and efficiently.
  - A: 0% (No one makes the mistake of correct circle type but wrong direction.)
  - B: 0% (No selection of a filled circle for \(x > -1\).)
  - C: 95% (Straightforward understanding and application.)
  - D: 5% (Very unlikely to make both mistakes.)

Given these considerations, the response would look like:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
