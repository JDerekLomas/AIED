## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to identify the region on a coordinate plane where \( x > 0 \) and \( y < 0 \). This corresponds to the fourth quadrant of the coordinate plane.

## 2: Identifying the Quadrants
- The first quadrant is where \( x > 0 \) and \( y > 0 \).
- The second quadrant is where \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \).
- The third quadrant is where \( x < 0 \) and \( y < 0 \).
- The fourth quadrant is where \( x > 0 \) and \( y < 0 \).

## 3: Analyzing the Coordinate Plane Provided
The coordinate plane provided has the x-axis ranging from -3 to 3 and the y-axis ranging from -3 to 3, showing all four quadrants.

## 4: Determining the Correct Region
The region that satisfies \( x > 0 \) and \( y < 0 \) is the fourth quadrant. By convention, quadrants are labeled counterclockwise starting from the upper right (first quadrant), so the fourth quadrant is on the right and below the x-axis.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the coordinate plane and the conditions given. They might confuse the quadrants or not fully understand the inequalities. The correct answer, D (fourth quadrant), might not be immediately obvious. There's a chance they could choose A, B, or C due to confusion. However, given the clear visual and simple conditions, a significant portion might still guess correctly or incorrectly based on a lack of understanding.
  
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding of the coordinate plane and should be able to identify the quadrants. However, they might make careless mistakes or not fully grasp the implications of \( x > 0 \) and \( y < 0 \). They are likely to get it right but might have a small chance of selecting the wrong quadrant.

- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid understanding of the coordinate plane and can easily identify the fourth quadrant as the region where \( x > 0 \) and \( y < 0 \). They are likely to choose the correct option, D, with a high degree of accuracy.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also apply it with ease. They will almost certainly choose the correct option, D.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=20%, B=20%, C=20%, D=40% (struggling to understand, but might guess right)
- **Basic**: A=5%, B=5%, C=10%, D=80% (mostly get it right, some confusion)
- **Proficient**: A=2%, B=2%, C=5%, D=91% (strong understanding, minor errors)
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (no errors)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=5% D=91%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
