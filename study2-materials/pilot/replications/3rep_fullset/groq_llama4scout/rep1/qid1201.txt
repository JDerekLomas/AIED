## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a straightforward problem involving angles on a straight line. The line is split into three parts labeled as \( a \), \( 4a \), and a right angle (\( 90^{\circ} \)). The task is to find the size of angle \( a \).

## 2: Identifying the Relevant Concept
The key concept here is that the sum of angles on a straight line is \( 180^{\circ} \). Therefore, we can set up the equation \( a + 4a + 90 = 180 \) to solve for \( a \).

## 3: Solving the Equation
Solving the equation:
\( 5a + 90 = 180 \)
\( 5a = 90 \)
\( a = 18 \)

## 4: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrectly applying the angle sum property or misinterpreting the given angles. However, this question is relatively straightforward and does not inherently suggest a trap that would lead to a common misconception like confusing \( 90^{\circ} \) with another value or misapplying angle properties.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with setting up the equation or solving for \( a \). They might not recognize the right angle as \( 90^{\circ} \) or could make calculation errors. Option D (Not enough information) might be appealing if they don't understand how to approach the problem. \( A=40\% \) \( B=20\% \) \( C=10\% \) \( D=30\% \)
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to set up and solve the equation but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. \( A=30\% \) \( B=40\% \) \( C=5\% \) \( D=25\% \)
- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve the equation and choose the correct answer. \( A=5\% \) \( B=80\% \) \( C=5\% \) \( D=10\% \)
- **Advanced**: Students at this level would not only solve the equation correctly but also do so efficiently. They are less likely to choose incorrect options. \( A=0\% \) \( B=90\% \) \( C=5\% \) \( D=5\% \)

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the solution, most students, especially those who are proficient or advanced, are expected to get it right.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
