## Step 1: Understand the question and the graph
The question provides a graph showing the cost of journeys from two taxi companies, P and Q, in relation to distance. Company P's cost starts at £0 and increases linearly, while Company Q's cost starts at £10 and also increases linearly. Both lines intersect at (5, 20), meaning at 5 miles, both companies charge £20.

## 2: Determine the equations of the lines
To find out after how many miles Company P is more expensive than Company Q, we first need the equations of the lines. The line for Company P passes through (0,0) and (5,20), so its gradient is \( \frac{20 - 0}{5 - 0} = 4 \). Thus, the equation for Company P is \( y = 4x \).

The line for Company Q passes through (0,10) and (5,20), so its gradient is \( \frac{20 - 10}{5 - 0} = 2 \). Thus, the equation for Company Q is \( y = 2x + 10 \).

## 3: Solve for when Company P is more expensive than Company Q
To find out when Company P is more expensive than Company Q, we set up the inequality \( 4x > 2x + 10 \), because we want to find when the cost of Company P (\( 4x \)) is greater than the cost of Company Q (\( 2x + 10 \)).

## 4: Solve the inequality
Solving \( 4x > 2x + 10 \):
\( 4x - 2x > 10 \)
\( 2x > 10 \)
\( x > 5 \)

## 5: Interpret the solution
This means that after 5 miles, Company P becomes more expensive than Company Q. Therefore, the correct answer is that Company P is more expensive than Company Q after 5 miles.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with reading the graph, understanding the concept of linear equations, or solving the inequality. They might incorrectly assume Company P is always cheaper or misread the graph. Option C (5 miles) seems correct but let's assume they might pick an option that's visually or conceptually appealing. \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 40\% \), \( D = 20\% \)

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make calculation errors. They should be able to understand the graph and set up a basic comparison but might not solve the inequality correctly. \( A = 15\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 60\% \), \( D = 15\% \)

- **Proficient**: These students can understand the graph, formulate equations, and solve inequalities. They should easily identify that after 5 miles Company P is more expensive. \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 80\% \), \( D = 10\% \)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level can quickly and accurately analyze the situation, possibly even solving it mentally. They'd likely all choose the correct option or have a strong understanding to eliminate incorrect ones. \( A = 0\% \), \( B = 0\% \), \( C = 95\% \), \( D = 5\% \)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
