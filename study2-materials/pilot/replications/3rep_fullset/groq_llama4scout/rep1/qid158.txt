To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with finding the range of a data set.

The range of a data set is found by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value. A common misconception is that students might think the first step involves arranging the numbers, but they might not specify the correct ordering or might confuse the process with finding the mean or another statistical measure.

- **Option A (Subtract the smallest number from the largest number):** This is the correct formula for finding the range but is asked as the first step. Students might realize this is what you do to find the range but might not understand it's not the "first" step in the process.

- **Option B (Write the numbers in ascending order):** This is a plausible first step because to identify the smallest and largest numbers, one typically needs to arrange the data. However, it's not explicitly stated that descending order wouldn't also work for identifying the smallest and largest.

- **Option C (Add all the numbers together):** This is incorrect for finding the range and is actually the step to find the sum of the data set, which is then used to calculate the mean.

- **Option D (Write the numbers in ascending or descending order):** This acknowledges that either order can be used to identify the smallest and largest numbers, making it a comprehensive and correct first step.

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might not fully understand the process. They could easily be confused about what to do first. 
  - A: 20% (some might remember the range formula but not the sequence)
  - B: 40% (might think arranging in ascending is necessary but not consider descending)
  - C: 20% (confusion with mean calculation)
  - D: 20% (understanding that order doesn’t matter but specifics are hard)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make procedural errors.
  - A: 10% (unlikely to directly suggest this as a first step)
  - B: 60% (likely to consider arranging in ascending as a logical step)
  - C: 15% (mistaking for mean calculation)
  - D: 15% (recognizing the validity of either order)

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts but may vary in strategy.
  - A: 5% (unlikely to think subtracting is the first step)
  - B: 30% (still might think ascending is implied)
  - C: 5% (clearly distinguish from mean)
  - D: 60% (efficient understanding that either order works)

- **Advanced:** Students here not only understand but can also optimize their approach.
  - A: 0% (know subtracting is not the first step)
  - B: 10% (acknowledge but might see it as incomplete)
  - C: 0% (mean calculation clearly distinguished)
  - D: 90% ( see that writing in either order efficiently identifies extremes)

So, in the required format:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=30% C=5% D=60%
advanced: A=0% B=10% C=0% D=90%
