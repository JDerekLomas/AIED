## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the length of a square given its area is \( 64 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \). The area \( A \) of a square is given by \( A = side^2 \), where "side" refers to the length of one of its sides.

## 2: Identifying the Correct Formula and Solution
To find the length of the side of the square, we use the formula \( side = \sqrt{A} \). Given \( A = 64 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \), the side length is \( \sqrt{64} = 8 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Errors
A common misconception might be confusing the area with the perimeter or directly using the area as a length, but given the straightforward nature of this question, it's less likely to trigger complex errors. However, students might confuse the operation needed (square root versus squaring) or simply not understand that the area of a square directly relates to its side length through the square root.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the relationship between area and side length of a square or might not know how to calculate the square root of 64. They might choose \( A = 32 \mathrm{~cm} \) (thinking of doubling the area), \( B = 16 \mathrm{~cm} \) (possibly halving 32), \( D = 64 \mathrm{~cm} \) (using the area directly), or \( C = 8 \mathrm{~cm} \) if they somehow recall or guess correctly.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but may struggle with applying the correct formula directly. They are more likely to recognize that \( 8^2 = 64 \), thus \( C = 8 \mathrm{~cm} \) should be correct, but some might still confuse with perimeter or directly choose \( D \) for lack of understanding.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the formula and can apply it correctly. They should mostly choose \( C = 8 \mathrm{~cm} \) with a high degree of accuracy, as they can calculate \( \sqrt{64} \) correctly.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the formula but are also less likely to make careless mistakes. They should also predominantly choose \( C = 8 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the simplicity of the question and the direct relationship between the area of a square and its side length:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (mix-up with operations), B=10% (random guess), C=40% (correct or lucky guess), D=30% (direct use of area).
- **Basic:** A=5% (simple mistake), B=5% (random), C=85% (correct application), D=5% (area confusion).
- **Proficient:** A=0% (understand formula), B=0% (unlikely mistake), C=95% (correct), D=5% (extremely rare mistake).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (confident), B=0%, C=100% (no mistakes expected), D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
