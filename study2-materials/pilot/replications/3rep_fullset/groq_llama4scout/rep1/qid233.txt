To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or correct understanding related to algebraic conventions.

The question focuses on the correct algebraic convention for the expression \(2 \div (3 + a \times b)\). The correct expression, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), is \( \frac{2}{3 + a \times b} \) or equivalently \( \frac{2}{a \times b + 3} \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Algebraic Convention
The expression given is \(2 \div (3 + a \times b)\). According to algebraic conventions, division by a term is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. Therefore, \(2 \div (3 + a \times b) = \frac{2}{3 + a \times b}\). This can also be written as \( \frac{2}{a \times b + 3} \) since addition is commutative.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( \frac{2}{3} + ab \) suggests an incorrect distribution of the division.
- Option B: \( \frac{2}{b(a + 3)} \) implies an incorrect factorization and does not follow from the given expression.
- Option C: \( \frac{2}{ab + 3} \) is algebraically equivalent to the correct answer but lacks the explicit multiplication symbol.
- Option D: \( \frac{2}{a \times b + 3} \) directly corresponds to the correct interpretation of the given expression.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic notation and order of operations. They are more likely to misinterpret the expression. Option A might attract some due to a lack of understanding of how to handle the division and parentheses, while Option B could be chosen by those who misinterpret the expression entirely. Option C might seem correct to some because it resembles a valid fraction but doesn't explicitly show multiplication. Option D is the correct answer but might not be chosen by many due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors. They are more likely to recognize the need for parentheses but might confuse the operations. Option A could still be a trap for those not understanding division by a sum. Option D would start to look more appealing as it directly addresses the expression given.
- **Proficient:** These students understand algebraic expressions and the order of operations well. They should recognize that Option D directly matches the correct interpretation of the given expression and that Options A and B are incorrect. Option C, while mathematically equivalent, might be less preferred due to the implicit multiplication.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of algebra and should easily identify the correct option. They might also appreciate the equivalence between Options C and D but recognize D as the explicitly correct form given the question's emphasis on "algebraic convention."

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (misinterpretation of division), B=20% (incorrect factorization), C=20% (partial understanding), D=30% (some understanding of notation).
- **Basic:** A=20%, B=15%, C=25%, D=40%.
- **Proficient:** A=10%, B=5%, C=15%, D=70%.
- **Advanced:** A=5%, B=0%, C=5%, D=90%.

The best answer is D.
