To solve this, let's first find a common denominator for \( \frac{1}{5} \), \( \frac{3}{10} \), and \( \frac{1}{2} \) to compare the proportions of blue, red, and purple counters directly.

## Step 1: Find a common denominator
The denominators are 5, 10, and 2. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5, 10, and 2 is 10. So, we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 10.
- \( \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1 \times 2}{5 \times 2} = \frac{2}{10} \) (blue)
- \( \frac{3}{10} \) remains the same (red)
- \( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 5}{2 \times 5} = \frac{5}{10} \) (purple)

## 2: Express the ratio of blue : red : purple
Now, we express the ratio of blue to red to purple counters.
- Blue : \( \frac{2}{10} \)
- Red : \( \frac{3}{10} \)
- Purple : \( \frac{5}{10} \)

To simplify, multiply each by 10 to get rid of the denominator:
- Blue : 2
- Red : 3
- Purple : 5

So, the ratio of blue : red : purple is \( 2 : 3 : 5 \).

## 3: Evaluate the answer choices
Given the ratio \( 2 : 3 : 5 \), let's look at the options:
- A: \( 2 : 3 : 5 \) matches our calculation.
- B: \( 1 : 3 : 1 \) does not match.
- C: \( 5 : 10 : 2 \) does not match.
- D: \( 1 : 4 : 5 \) does not match.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with fractions and ratios. They might not correctly convert fractions to a comparable form or might confuse the ratios. Given the fractions and the need to find a common denominator, a significant portion might choose incorrectly, but some might guess or choose based on partial understanding. 
  - A: 40% (if they understand the concept of ratio and can partially apply it)
  - B: 20% (misconception or guess)
  - C: 15% (misconception)
  - D: 25% (misconception or guess)

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic fractions and ratios. They should be able to find a common denominator and understand the concept of ratios but might make calculation errors.
  - A: 60%
  - B: 15%
  - C: 10%
  - D: 15%

- **Proficient**: These students understand fractions, ratios, and can apply them accurately. They should easily find the common denominator and the correct ratio.
  - A: 80%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 10%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can also manipulate and apply concepts quickly. They are less likely to make errors.
  - A: 90%
  - B: 2%
  - C: 2%
  - D: 6%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=2% D=6%
