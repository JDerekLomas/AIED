To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the statements made by Jo and Paul and the nature of the question.

## Step 1: Understanding the Statements
Jo claims that a fraction cannot be simplified if either the numerator or denominator is a prime number. Paul claims that a fraction can always be simplified if neither the numerator nor the denominator is prime.

## 2: Evaluating Jo's Statement
Jo's statement is incorrect because having a prime number in the numerator or denominator does not prevent a fraction from being simplified. For example, the fraction 2/4 can be simplified to 1/2, and here 2 is a prime number.

## 3: Evaluating Paul's Statement
Paul's statement is also incorrect because having neither the numerator nor the denominator as a prime number does not guarantee that a fraction can always be simplified. For instance, the fraction 4/9 cannot be simplified further, and neither 4 nor 9 is a prime number.

## 4: Considering Student Understanding
- Students at the below_basic level might not fully understand prime numbers or simplification of fractions, potentially leading to a higher chance of selecting incorrect options due to lack of knowledge.
- Basic level students might have a grasp of prime numbers and fraction simplification but could still fall into common misconceptions.
- Proficient students should have a solid understanding of both concepts and be less likely to fall for the misconceptions presented.
- Advanced students are expected to have a deep understanding and be able to critically evaluate statements like those made by Jo and Paul.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
Given the nature of the question, let's consider the likely responses:
- **Below Basic**: These students might struggle with the concepts of prime numbers and fraction simplification. They could mistakenly believe Jo (A) because they think prime numbers are "special" and prevent simplification, or they might not understand Paul's statement well enough to see its flaw. Paul's statement might seem plausible to some, leading to B. However, without a strong grasp of either concept, they might also choose D (neither is correct) if they've encountered counterexamples or if their misunderstanding leads them to reject both statements. Option C (both Jo and Paul) seems unlikely as it requires understanding both are incorrect.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (misunderstanding about prime numbers), B=30% (thinking neither being prime guarantees simplification), C=10% (unlikely to understand both are wrong), D=20% (rejecting both due to some level of understanding).
- **Basic**: A=20% (common misconception), B=20% (some understanding but flawed), C=5% (recognizing both are incorrect is challenging at this level), D=55% (more likely to see through both statements).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (understands prime numbers but might recall common fractions), B=5% (understands conditions for simplification), C=5% (unlikely), D=85% (clearly sees both statements as incorrect).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (well aware of prime numbers and simplification), B=0% (understands the conditions), C=0% (sees the flaw in both), D=100% (no misconceptions).

## 7: Finalizing Predictions
Based on these considerations, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=5% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
