To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question step by step.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question involves reflecting a rectangle across a vertical line in a grid and determining the effect on two points, P and Q. Point P is at the top right corner of the rectangle, and point Q is at the bottom right corner of the rectangle. The vertical line of reflection is to the right of both points and serves as the right edge of the rectangle.

## 2: Identifying Key Concepts
The key concept here is understanding reflections in geometry. When a point is reflected across a line, it moves to the opposite side of the line but at the same distance from the line. For a point to stay in the same position after reflection across a line, it must be on the line of reflection.

## 3: Analyzing Point P and Q
- Point P is on the rectangle but not on the vertical line of reflection. Reflecting the rectangle (and thus point P) across the vertical line would move point P to a new position on the other side of the line, not keep it in the same place.
- Point Q, similar to point P, is on the rectangle and not on the line of reflection. Therefore, reflecting the rectangle across the vertical line would also move point Q to a new position.

## 4: Addressing Common Misconceptions
A common misconception might be thinking that points on the figure being reflected automatically stay in the same position if they are part of the reflection, which is not true unless they are on the line of reflection.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of reflection and its impact on points not on the line of reflection. They might incorrectly assume that reflecting the rectangle means points P and Q automatically stay put because they are part of the rectangle being reflected. Thus, they might choose C (Both Tom and Katie) or D (Neither is correct) due to a lack of understanding. A=10%, B=10%, C=40%, D=40%
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of geometric concepts but might still be prone to misconceptions. They might recognize that points not on the line of reflection move, but could be unsure. Expect some to still choose incorrectly, especially if they misunderstand how reflection works. A=20%, B=20%, C=30%, D=30%
- **Proficient:** Students at this level understand the concept of reflection and can apply it. They should recognize that neither Tom nor Katie is correct because reflecting the rectangle across the vertical line moves both points P and Q to new positions. A=5%, B=5%, C=10%, D=80%
- **Advanced:** These students have a deep understanding of geometric transformations, including reflections. They will easily identify that both Tom and Katie are incorrect, as neither point stays in the same position after reflection across the line. A=0%, B=0%, C=5%, D=95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=40% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
