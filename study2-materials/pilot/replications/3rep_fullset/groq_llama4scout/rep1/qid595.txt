To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question "Find \( 20 \% \) of \( 80 \)," let's analyze the question and the potential for misconceptions.

The question requires students to calculate \( 20 \% \) of \( 80 \), which can be done by converting the percentage to a decimal and then multiplying by the number: \( 20 \% = 0.20 \) and \( 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is straightforward: find \( 20 \% \) of \( 80 \). This involves a basic understanding of percentages and multiplication.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the percentage with a fraction or decimal directly or incorrectly applying the percentage to the number. For example, some might think \( 20 \% \) of \( 80 \) is \( 20 \times 80 \) or incorrectly calculate \( 20 \% \) as \( 0.2 \times 100 \) instead of \( 0.20 \times 80 \).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( 8 \)
- B: \( 20 \)
- C: \( 96 \)
- D: \( 16 \)

The correct answer is D: \( 16 \).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic percentage calculations. They might confuse operations or not understand percentages well. Option B (\( 20 \)) could be a guess for those who misunderstand percentages as directly related to the number without conversion. Option A (\( 8 \)) could be chosen by those who mistakenly calculate \( 10 \% \) of \( 80 \) (which is \( 8 \)) and think that's \( 20 \% \). C (\( 96 \)) seems less likely as it doesn't relate to simple miscalculations of \( 20 \% \) of \( 80 \). So, below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a grasp of basic percentage calculations but might make simple errors. They are more likely to get it right but could be tempted by incorrect calculations. So, basic: A=10% B=15% C=5% D=70%.
- **Proficient:** These students understand percentages and can apply them correctly. The chance of error is low, but they might still be distracted by obviously incorrect options. So, proficient: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident in their mathematical abilities, including percentage calculations. They are least likely to make errors on simple calculations like this. So, advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=5% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
