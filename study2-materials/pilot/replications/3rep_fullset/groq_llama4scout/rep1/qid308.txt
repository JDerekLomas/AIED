To approach this question, let's first analyze the algebraic expression given: \( \frac{t^{2}+2t+1}{t+1} \). This expression can be simplified by factoring the numerator. The numerator \( t^{2}+2t+1 \) can be recognized as a perfect square trinomial, which factors into \( (t+1)^{2} \). Therefore, the expression simplifies to \( \frac{(t+1)^{2}}{t+1} \). For \( t \neq -1 \), this simplifies further to \( t+1 \), because \( \frac{(t+1)^{2}}{t+1} = t+1 \) when \( t+1 \neq 0 \).

## Step 1: Identify the Correct Simplification
The correct simplification of the given expression is \( t+1 \), for \( t \neq -1 \). This implies that the expression can indeed be simplified, and the correct answer is B) \( t+1 \).

## 2: Consider Common Misconceptions and Errors
A common error might involve not recognizing the perfect square trinomial or incorrectly simplifying the expression. However, the structure of this question and the well-known factorization \( (t+1)^{2} \) should guide most students towards the correct answer, especially those at the proficient or advanced levels.

## 3: Analyze the Question Options
- A) \( t+2 \) seems like an incorrect guess.
- B) \( t+1 \) is the correct simplification.
- C) \( t^{2}+t \) would be an incorrect manipulation.
- D) Does not simplify is incorrect since the expression can be simplified.

## 4: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with algebraic manipulations and recognizing perfect square trinomials. They might incorrectly simplify or not simplify at all. A=20% (random guess), B=30% (manage to simplify but might make errors), C=20% (incorrect but related to the original expression), D=30% (do not know how to simplify).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebra. They might recognize the square but could still make mistakes. A=10%, B=60%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebraic expressions and should easily recognize the factorization. A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are very comfortable with algebra and should have no issues. A=0%, B=95%, C=0%, D=5%.

## 5: Assign Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
