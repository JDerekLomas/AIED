## Step 1: Understand the question and the chart
The question provides a bar chart showing the number of cups of tea and coffee sold over 4 days. We need to determine how many cups of coffee were sold on Tuesday.

## 2: Analyze the chart for Tuesday's coffee sales
The bar for coffee on Tuesday reaches 5 small boxes above 40. Since the vertical scale has 10 small boxes between 0 and 10, each small box represents 1 unit. Therefore, 5 small boxes above 40 represent an additional 5 units.

## 3: Calculate Tuesday's coffee sales
To find the total cups of coffee sold on Tuesday, we add the 5 units (from the 5 small boxes above 40) to 40, which gives us 45 cups of coffee.

## 4: Evaluate the difficulty of the question
This question requires reading the chart accurately and understanding the scale. The potential for error could come from misinterpreting the scale or miscounting the boxes. However, the question is straightforward, and the chart is simple, which should help most students.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with reading the chart or understanding the scale. They might not accurately count the boxes or might add incorrectly. Given the simplicity of the numbers involved (just adding 5 to 40), even struggling students might be able to get it right or choose an obviously incorrect answer. A=10% (guessing), B=10% (miscalculation), C=5% (significant miscalculation), D=75% (correct calculation).
- **Basic:** Students at this level should be able to read the chart and perform simple calculations. They are likely to get the correct answer or make a simple mistake. A=5%, B=15% (misreading the chart), C=5%, D=75%.
- **Proficient:** These students are expected to accurately read the chart and calculate the answer. A=2%, B=5%, C=2%, D=91%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students should have no trouble with this question. A=1%, B=2%, C=1%, D=96%.

## 6: Convert predictions into the required format
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
- **basic:** A=5% B=15% C=5% D=75%
- **proficient:** A=2% B=5% C=2% D=91%
- **advanced:** A=1% B=2% C=1% D=96%

The best answer is D.
