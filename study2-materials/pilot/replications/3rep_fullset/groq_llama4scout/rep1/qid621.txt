## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to calculate the arrival time of a coach in London, given that it takes 3 hours and 50 minutes to complete the journey from Manchester and it leaves Manchester at 09:25.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception in time calculations is the incorrect handling of hours and minutes, especially when the time spans across noon or midnight. However, in this case, the journey starts in the morning and lasts for less than 4 hours, reducing the likelihood of errors related to AM/PM or midnight crossings.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 13: 25 \) (1:25 PM)
- Option B: \( 12: 75 \) (This is incorrect because 75 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour and 15 minutes, and there's no 12:75 in standard time notation)
- Option C: \( 01:15 \) (This would imply the coach travels into the next day, which is not possible given the duration and start time)
- Option D: \( 13: 15 \) (1:15 PM)

## 4: Calculating the Arrival Time
To find the arrival time, add 3 hours and 50 minutes to 09:25.
- 09:25 + 3 hours = 12:25
- 12:25 + 50 minutes = 13:15

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic time calculations. They might not accurately add 3 hours and 50 minutes to 09:25. Option B (\( 12: 75 \)) could attract some due to a misunderstanding of time formats, but most would likely struggle to select the correct option. \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 30\% \)
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are likely to understand the concept of adding time but could be tricked by simple errors. \( A = 15\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 55\% \)
- **Proficient:** These students should accurately calculate the arrival time. \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 0\% \), \( D = 90\% \)
- **Advanced:** Students at this level will almost certainly get it right, as they have a strong grasp of time calculations and are less likely to make simple mistakes. \( A = 0\% \), \( B = 0\% \), \( C = 0\% \), \( D = 100\% \)

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation and the fact that it doesn't specifically test a common misconception in a tricky way, most students, especially those at the proficient and advanced levels, are expected to get it right.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=10% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
