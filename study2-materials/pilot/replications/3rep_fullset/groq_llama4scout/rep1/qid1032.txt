To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \(5 + 4 \times 3 =\), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with it.

The question tests the understanding of the order of operations, specifically the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction), which dictates that multiplication should be performed before addition.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Solution
The correct solution to \(5 + 4 \times 3\) is \(5 + 12 = 17\), which corresponds to option B.

## 2: Identifying Common Misconceptions
A common misconception is to perform operations from left to right, which would lead to \(5 + 4 = 9\), then \(9 \times 3 = 27\), making option A a potentially attractive incorrect answer.

## 3: Analyzing Option C and D
Options C (60) and D (12) seem less likely to be chosen by students who have a basic understanding of arithmetic operations, as they do not result from simple left-to-right errors or other common misconceptions directly related to the order of operations.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations. They might calculate \(5 + 4 \times 3\) as \(5 + 4 = 9\), then \(9 \times 3 = 27\). So, A=60%, B=20%, C=5%, D=15%.
- **Basic:** At this level, students are more likely to understand the basic order of operations but might still make careless mistakes. They might still be tempted by left-to-right calculations, but more are expected to get it right. So, A=30%, B=60%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** Students here are expected to have a solid grasp of the order of operations. They should mostly choose B, with minimal errors. So, A=10%, B=85%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the order of operations but are also likely to double-check their work. The error rate should be very low. So, A=5%, B=90%, C=2%, D=3%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
basic: A=30% B=60% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=85% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
