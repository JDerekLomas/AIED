## Step 1: Understand the question and the common misconception
The question requires solving the inequality \(3n + 2 \geq 4n - 5\). A common misconception in solving inequalities is reversing the inequality sign when dividing or multiplying by a negative number, but in this case, the potential trap could be in rearranging the terms.

## 2: Solve the inequality correctly
To solve \(3n + 2 \geq 4n - 5\), we first subtract \(3n\) from both sides to get \(2 \geq n - 5\). Then, we add \(5\) to both sides to get \(7 \geq n\). This can also be written as \(n \leq 7\).

## 3: Analyze the answer choices
The correct solution \(7 \geq n\) or \(n \leq 7\) matches option C. Let's analyze the other options:
- A: \(-3 \geq n\) does not match our solution.
- B: \(1 \geq n\) does not match our solution.
- D: \(n \geq 7\) suggests the opposite of our solution.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic:** Students at this level might struggle with rearranging the inequality and could easily pick the wrong option due to a lack of understanding of how to solve inequalities. They might confuse the steps or forget to reverse the inequality sign when necessary (though not directly applicable here). Option C is likely to be chosen by a smaller percentage compared to others due to the confusion. \(A=20\%\), \(B=25\%\), \(C=30\%\), \(D=25\%\).
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make careless mistakes or not fully understand the inequality. They are more likely to get it right than below_basic students but still might choose incorrect options due to oversight. \(A=10\%\), \(B=15\%\), \(C=60\%\), \(D=15\%\).
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept and can solve it correctly most of the time. They might still make occasional mistakes but are less likely to. \(A=5\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=80\%\), \(D=10\%\).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident and accurate in their mathematical abilities. They are very likely to solve the inequality correctly. \(A=2\%\), \(B=2\%\), \(C=90\%\), \(D=6\%\).

## 5: Adjust predictions based on question specifics
Given the straightforward nature of this inequality and the lack of negative coefficients which often lead to sign reversals (a common source of errors), even students at lower levels might perform better than expected. However, the question still requires careful algebraic manipulation.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=30% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
