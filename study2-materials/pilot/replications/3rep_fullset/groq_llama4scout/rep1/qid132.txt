To approach this question, let's first analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie and assess their validity based on the rules of solving inequalities.

Tom's statement: \( -2m > 12 \) implies \( m < -6 \) when solved correctly. To solve it:
\[ -2m > 12 \]
\[ m < -6 \] (dividing or multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number reverses the inequality sign)

So, Tom's solution \( m > -6 \) is incorrect.

Katie's statement: \( -2 + m > 12 \) implies:
\[ m > 14 \] when solved correctly. To solve it:
\[ m > 12 + 2 \]
\[ m > 14 \]

So, Katie's solution \( m > 14 \) is correct.

Given this, let's evaluate the options:
- Tom is incorrect.
- Katie is correct.

This means the correct answer is B) Only Katie.

Now, let's consider the likely responses from students at different ability levels:

### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with basic algebra and inequality rules. They might not fully understand the concept of solving inequalities, especially when it involves negative numbers or simple algebraic manipulations.
- A: Only Tom: 20% (some might incorrectly side with Tom due to misunderstanding)
- B: Only Katie: 40% (some understand Katie but not necessarily why Tom is wrong)
- C: Both Tom and Katie: 10% (unlikely, as it requires understanding both are incorrect or both correct, which isn't the case)
- D: Neither is correct: 30% (some recognize both have made errors)

### basic
Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may make careless mistakes or not fully grasp the implications of operations on inequalities.
- A: Only Tom: 15% (less likely to mistakenly support Tom)
- B: Only Katie: 60% (most recognize Katie's correctness)
- C: Both Tom and Katie: 5% (unlikely to think both are correct)
- D: Neither is correct: 20% (some may see that Tom is wrong but not Katie's validity)

### proficient
Proficient students understand the rules of inequalities and can apply them but might occasionally make a mistake under pressure or with tricky questions.
- A: Only Tom: 5% (unlikely to mistakenly support Tom)
- B: Only Katie: 80% (most recognize Katie's correctness and Tom's error)
- C: Both Tom and Katie: 5% (very unlikely)
- D: Neither is correct: 10% (unlikely, as Katie is correct)

### advanced
Advanced students not only understand but can also apply and explain the concepts with ease. They are less likely to make mistakes on straightforward inequality questions.
- A: Only Tom: 0% (would not mistakenly support Tom)
- B: Only Katie: 90% (confident in Katie's correctness and understanding Tom's mistake)
- C: Both Tom and Katie: 0% (know Katie is correct and Tom is incorrect)
- D: Neither is correct: 10% (extremely unlikely)

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=0% D=10%
