## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to expand the expression \(3(p-1)\). This is a basic algebra question that tests the student's understanding of distributing a number across a subtraction within parentheses.

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
A common misconception when expanding expressions like \(3(p-1)\) is that students might forget to distribute the 3 to both terms inside the parentheses or might incorrectly apply the operation. The correct expansion is \(3p - 3\).

## 3: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \(3p - 3\), which is the correct expansion of \(3(p-1)\). Students who understand how to distribute a number across subtraction within parentheses will choose this option.

## 4: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \(3p - 1\). This option might appeal to students who incorrectly think that the 3 only multiplies the \(p\) and not the \(-1\), or those who simply don't distribute the 3 properly.

## 5: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \(p - 3\). This would be chosen by students who have a significant misunderstanding of how to distribute, possibly thinking that \(3 \times p = p\) and \(3 \times -1 = -3\), but incorrectly handling the variables.

## 6: Analyzing Option D
Option D is \(3p - 2\). This option doesn't directly follow from a common mistake related to the distribution property but might seem plausible to students who make minor calculation errors.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might choose B, C, or D due to a lack of understanding of distribution. A=20% (some might get it by guess), B=40% (common mistake), C=30% (significant misunderstanding), D=10% (minor error).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make simple mistakes. A=60% (correct), B=30% (common error), C=5% (less likely), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebra well and are less likely to make simple distribution errors. A=90% (correct), B=5% (rare mistake), C=2% (very unlikely), D=3% (rare).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are very confident in their algebraic skills. A=95% (correct), B=2% (unlikely), C=1% (very rare), D=2% (rare).

## 8: Finalizing Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
- **basic**: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
