To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question asks to express "\( m \) multiplied by the cube of \( n \)" in correct algebraic notation. The correct answer is \( m n^{3} \), which corresponds to option B.

- **Understanding the Task**: The task requires understanding of basic algebraic notation, specifically the representation of multiplication and exponentiation. 

- **Potential Misconceptions**:
  - A common misconception might be to confuse the order of operations or the application of exponents, leading to incorrect expressions like \( (m n)^{3} \) (option A), which implies \( m \) and \( n \) are both raised to the third power after being multiplied together, rather than just \( n \) being cubed.
  - Another misconception could involve adding or simply multiplying \( m \), \( n \), and \( 3 \) in various combinations, leading to incorrect answers like \( m n + 3 \) (option C) or \( 3 m n \) (option D).

Given these considerations, let's estimate the performance at each ability level:

### below_basic
At this level, students may struggle with basic algebraic concepts and notation. They might not fully understand the concept of "the cube of \( n \)" or how to represent multiplication in algebra.
- A: \( (m n)^{3} \) might appeal due to confusion about how to apply the exponent.
- B: \( m n^{3} \) is the correct answer but might be challenging for this group to produce.
- C: \( m n + 3 \) could be a guess that doesn't accurately reflect understanding of exponents or multiplication.
- D: \( 3 m n \) might seem correct due to a misunderstanding of "cube" as simply multiplying by 3.

Estimation: 
- below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra but may still make errors due to lack of practice or misunderstanding of specific notation.
- The correct answer, B, should be more accessible, but there might still be confusion with A or D.

Estimation: 
- basic: A=15% B=60% C=15% D=10%

### proficient
Proficient students are expected to have a solid grasp of algebraic notation and operations. They should easily identify the correct expression.

Estimation: 
- proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%

### advanced
Advanced students not only understand algebraic notation but are also familiar with more complex algebraic manipulations. They are less likely to make errors on this type of question.

Estimation: 
- advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%

Therefore, the predictions are:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
