## Step 1: Understand the question and the statements made by Tom and Katie.
The question presents a scenario where Tom and Katie discuss the effect of two different operations on the range of heights of 5 plants. The initial heights of the plants are given as \( 24 \mathrm{~cm}, 17 \mathrm{~cm}, 42 \mathrm{~cm}, 26 \mathrm{~cm}, 13 \mathrm{~cm} \). Tom claims that if all the plants were cut in half, the range wouldn't change. Katie claims that if all the plants grew by \( 3 \mathrm{~cm} \) each, the range wouldn't change.

## 2: Determine the range of the initial heights.
To assess the claims, first, we need to find the range of the initial heights. The range is calculated as the difference between the highest and lowest values. The highest height is \( 42 \mathrm{~cm} \) and the lowest is \( 13 \mathrm{~cm} \), so the initial range is \( 42 - 13 = 29 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 3: Evaluate Tom's statement - cutting all plants in half.
If all plants are cut in half, their new heights would be \( 12 \mathrm{~cm}, 8.5 \mathrm{~cm}, 21 \mathrm{~cm}, 13 \mathrm{~cm}, 6.5 \mathrm{~cm} \). The new highest height is \( 21 \mathrm{~cm} \) and the new lowest is \( 6.5 \mathrm{~cm} \), making the new range \( 21 - 6.5 = 14.5 \mathrm{~cm} \). This means Tom's statement is incorrect because the range changes from \( 29 \mathrm{~cm} \) to \( 14.5 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 4: Evaluate Katie's statement - all plants grow by \( 3 \mathrm{~cm} \).
If all plants grow by \( 3 \mathrm{~cm} \), their new heights would be \( 27 \mathrm{~cm}, 20 \mathrm{~cm}, 45 \mathrm{~cm}, 29 \mathrm{~cm}, 16 \mathrm{~cm} \). The new highest height is \( 45 \mathrm{~cm} \) and the new lowest is \( 16 \mathrm{~cm} \), making the new range \( 45 - 16 = 29 \mathrm{~cm} \). This means Katie's statement is correct because the range remains \( 29 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic concepts of range and changes to data sets. They might not fully understand the implications of scaling or translating data sets. Given the complexity of understanding how operations affect range, they might lean towards incorrect options or be unsure.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might not fully grasp how different operations (like multiplication or addition) affect statistical measures like range. They might be more likely to incorrectly agree with Tom or choose an option that seems plausible but is incorrect.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts of range and how it changes under different operations. They should recognize that adding a constant to all values doesn't change the range but multiplying all values by a constant does. Thus, they should agree with Katie and disagree with Tom.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the concepts but can also apply them accurately in various contexts. They should have no trouble identifying that Katie is correct and Tom is incorrect.

## 6: Assign percentages based on the understanding of the question and common misconceptions.
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (Tom seems plausible because cutting in half seems like it could preserve differences), B=20% (Katie's statement might seem correct but could be hard to understand), C=10% (unlikely to understand both correctly), D=30% (not understanding either).
- **Basic**: A=30%, B=25%, C=20%, D=25%.
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=60%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
