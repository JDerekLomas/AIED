To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question presents a simple scenario with 8 squares and 5 circles and asks for the ratio of squares to circles. The correct ratio of squares to circles is \(8:5\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question directly asks for a ratio, which is a basic mathematical concept. The numbers given are small integers, making the calculation straightforward.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be adding the numbers of squares and circles to get a total and then trying to form a ratio with one of the components. For example, some might incorrectly think the ratio involves the total number of shapes (13) in some way.

## 3: Analyzing Option A (\(5:13\))
This option suggests a misunderstanding where the respondent might be considering the number of circles and the total number of shapes. This seems like a plausible error for students who are not confident in their understanding of ratios.

## 4: Analyzing Option B (\(8:5\))
This is the correct answer. Students with a good understanding of ratios and how to calculate them should easily identify this as the correct ratio of squares to circles.

## 5: Analyzing Option C (\(8:13\))
This option might suggest that a student understands the need to include the total number of shapes but incorrectly applies it to represent the ratio of squares to the total, rather than understanding it's about the comparison between squares and circles.

## 6: Analyzing Option D (\(5:8\))
This option reverses the ratio. It shows an understanding that a ratio is involved but a lack of attention to which quantity is being compared to the other.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students may struggle with basic mathematical concepts. They might not understand what a ratio is or how to calculate it. Expect a high chance of choosing an option that involves incorrect calculations or misunderstandings. Option A (\(5:13\)) and Option C (\(8:13\)) might appeal to those who add numbers incorrectly or misunderstand the concept of ratio. **A=30%, B=20%, C=30%, D=20%**
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of mathematical concepts but might still make simple errors. They are more likely to choose the correct option but could be tempted by simple errors like reversing the ratio. **A=10%, B=70%, C=10%, D=10%**
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of mathematical concepts, including ratios. They are less likely to make errors but might still choose an incorrect option if they're not paying close attention. **A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%**
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and are highly unlikely to make simple errors. They will almost certainly choose the correct option. **A=0%, B=95%, C=0%, D=5%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
