To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to expanding and simplifying expressions, particularly with squaring a binomial.

The expression given is \( (x-4)^{2} \). The correct expansion and simplification of this expression involve applying the formula \((a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\). Applying this formula:

\( (x-4)^{2} = x^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot 4 + 4^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16 \).

So, the correct answer is A: \( x^{2}-8 x+16 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
A common misconception when expanding squared binomials is forgetting to multiply the terms inside the parentheses by each other or incorrectly applying the signs. For example, some might mistakenly write \( x^2 + 16 \) (B), \( x^2 - 16 \) (C), or \( x^2 - 8x - 16 \) (D), often due to errors in applying the formula or careless mistakes in calculation.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( x^{2}+16 \), might seem plausible to students who forget the middle term \( -8x \) or incorrectly assume the expansion results in \( x^2 + 4^2 \) without considering \( -2 \cdot x \cdot 4 \).

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( x^{2}-16 \), could appeal to students who incorrectly think the expansion only involves squaring the terms inside the parentheses without accounting for the middle term.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \( x^{2}-8 x-16 \), might attract students who mistakenly subtract \( 16 \) instead of adding it, possibly due to a confusion with the formula or a simple arithmetic mistake.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might not fully understand algebraic expansion or might not recognize the formula. They are likely to choose incorrectly, with B, C, and D being tempting due to a lack of understanding. A=20% (guessing or partially correct understanding), B=30%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have basic algebraic skills but might still struggle with applying formulas correctly. They are more likely to recognize the need for a \( -8x \) term but might make careless errors. A=50%, B=25%, C=15%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand algebraic identities and can apply them. They are likely to get it right but might still make minor errors. A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are highly confident in their algebraic manipulations and are unlikely to make errors on straightforward questions like this. A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
