## Step 1: Understand the original sequence and the change
The original sequence starts with Pattern 1 having a central column of three squares with an extra square on either side, making a total of 5 squares. Pattern 2 consists of two central columns of three squares with one extra square on either side, making a total of 8 squares. This implies that each pattern number \(n\) can be represented by a formula based on its visual structure.

## 2: Determine the formula for the original sequence
For Pattern \(n\), the first pattern has \(3 + 2(n-1)\) squares because it adds 2 squares for each increase in \(n\). The second pattern has \(6 + 2(n-1)\) squares because it starts with 6 squares and adds 2 for each \(n\). Given that Pattern 100 has 302 squares, let's verify which pattern it refers to. If it's the first type, then \(3 + 2(100-1) = 3 + 2*99 = 3 + 198 = 201\) squares, which doesn't match. For the second type, \(6 + 2(100-1) = 6 + 198 = 204\) squares, also not matching. However, given that 302 squares are mentioned for Pattern 100, and assuming a simple linear relationship for one of the patterns: if we consider \(5 + 6(n-1) = 5 + 6*99 = 5 + 594 = 599\) for one possible pattern and \(8 + 6(n-1) = 8 + 6*99 = 8 + 594 = 602\) for another, it's clear there was a misunderstanding in directly applying these formulas without the exact formula provided. The question directly states there are 302 squares in Pattern 100, implying a specific sequence.

## 3: Analyze the sequence and change
Given that there are 302 squares in Pattern 100 and assuming a linear increase, let's consider a general approach. If the pattern increases by a certain rule (e.g., +3, +3, +3, ... for a central column and +1, +1 for sides), then removing one square from each column of three would decrease the total by 1 square per column of three.

## 4: Understand the effect of the shape change
The change involves removing the second block from each column of three squares. In the original pattern leading to 302 squares in Pattern 100, if we consider a structure that could lead to such a number, we'd have to determine the decrease based on how many columns of three are present.

## 5: Calculate the decrease in squares
If Pattern 100 originally has 302 squares and assuming it follows a sequence where such a number is plausible (like 2 columns of 3 for each \(n\), plus 2), then for every \(n\), there might be \(6n - 4\) squares (as \(n=1\) gives 2 squares, and \(n=100\) gives 302 if \(6*100 - 4*100 + 2 = 600 - 398 = 202\) doesn't fit but \(2*3*100 - 2*2*100 + 2 = 600 + 2 = 602\) and adjusting for accurate formula) actually let's use another direct logic. For a sequence that could fit 302 squares: if one pattern type gives 5, 11, 17... squares (adding 6), and the other 8, 14, 20... (also adding 6), the 100th term could actually fit a \(5 + 6*99 = 599\) type sequence or similar but directly related to n directly by another pattern.

## 6: Determine the number of squares after the change
The question then becomes how many squares are removed: If each pattern of \(n\) columns has 2 columns of 3 (total 6) and 2 extra, then for \(n=100\), \(6*100 + 2 = 602\). Losing one square per column of 3 reduces this by 2, making \(602 - 2 = 600\). But assuming Pattern 100 equals 302 due to misinterpretation let actual calculation do. If Pattern \(n\) actually could have \(2n + 2n + 2\) then at \(n=100\), there are indeed \(2*100 + 2*100 = 400\), actually pattern increases \(| 3 , 6 , ... , 300\) for central parts then 2 on end: \( 3n | + |2 =  300 +2n\). So  \( 302 = 3*100 + 2\). And  then pattern gets  \(|central=   100*2= 200| plus , 2   .. Thus 200+2 , Then removing square  it drops 2 , Hence becomes
