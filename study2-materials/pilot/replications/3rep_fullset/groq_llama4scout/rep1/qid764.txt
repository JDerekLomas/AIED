To approach this question, let's analyze the statement: "Common multiples of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) are also multiples of \( 25 \)" and evaluate its validity.

## Step 1: Understanding Common Multiples
The common multiples of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) are the multiples of their least common multiple (LCM), which is \( 10 \). This means any number that is a multiple of \( 10 \) is a common multiple of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \).

## 2: Evaluating the Statement
For a common multiple of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) to also be a multiple of \( 25 \), it must be divisible by \( 25 \). The multiples of \( 10 \) are \( 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, ... \) and the multiples of \( 25 \) are \( 25, 50, 75, 100, ... \). It's clear that not all multiples of \( 10 \) are multiples of \( 25 \), but some are (e.g., \( 50, 100, ... \)).

## 3: Identifying the Error
The statement seems to imply that all common multiples of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) (which are multiples of \( 10 \)) are also multiples of \( 25 \), which is not true. For example, \( 10 \) and \( 20 \) are common multiples of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) but are not multiples of \( 25 \).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concepts of multiples, LCM, or how to evaluate the truth of a statement about numbers. They might incorrectly assume the statement is always true because they don't fully grasp the conditions for being a multiple of \( 25 \). So, A=60% (assuming it's always true), B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding of multiples and might start to see that not all multiples of \( 10 \) are multiples of \( 25 \), but could still be confused. They might choose B (sometimes true) or C (never true) with some understanding that it's not always true. So, A=30%, B=40% (recognizing it doesn't apply all the time), C=20%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand that the LCM of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) is \( 10 \) and that not all multiples of \( 10 \) are multiples of \( 25 \). They should recognize the statement is not always true but might see that it can be true sometimes (for multiples of \( 50 \)). So, A=10%, B=60% (acknowledging there are instances where it's true and not), C=20%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will quickly identify that common multiples of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \) are multiples of \( 10 \), and only those that are also multiples of \( 50 \) (the LCM of \( 10 \) and \( 25 \)) are multiples of \( 25 \). They should accurately conclude that the statement is sometimes true. So, A=5%, B=80% (they understand the conditions under which it's true), C=10%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
