To approach this question, let's first analyze what the question is testing and the common misconceptions associated with solving equations, particularly those involving fractions.

The equation given is \(\frac{2r - 3}{5} = 2 + r\). The task is to identify the correct first step to solve this equation from the provided options. 

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Method
The correct first step to solve the equation \(\frac{2r - 3}{5} = 2 + r\) involves clearing the fraction. This can be done by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5, which is the denominator of the fraction. This leads to \(2r - 3 = 5(2 + r)\).

## 2: Expanding the Correct Step
Expanding \(5(2 + r)\) gives \(2r - 3 = 10 + 5r\). This matches option D: \(2r - 3 = 10 + 5r\), indicating that D is the correct answer.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(\frac{2r}{5} = 5 + r\). This option incorrectly separates the terms within the fraction and does not correctly multiply both sides by 5 to clear the denominator.
- Option B: \(10r - 15 = 10 + 5r\). This would be correct if the original equation was multiplied by 5 but then incorrectly solved; it seems to misunderstand the distribution.
- Option C: \(2r - 3 = 10 + r\). This suggests multiplying both sides by 5 but only multiplying the right side by 5, not accounting for \(r\).
- Option D: \(2r - 3 = 10 + 5r\). This correctly multiplies both sides by 5 and distributes on the right side.

## 4: Anticipating Student Errors
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might choose A because it seems like a simplistic approach or not understand how to deal with the fraction, leading to A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here understand basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They could be tempted by C because it looks like a straightforward multiplication by 5 on the left but not on the right, A=30%, B=15%, C=30%, D=25%.
- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebra. They are less likely to make the error of not multiplying the entire right side by 5, so A=10%, B=5%, C=15%, D=70%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are very confident in their algebraic skills. They would easily identify D as the correct step, with minimal consideration for incorrect options, A=0%, B=0%, C=5%, D=95%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=15% C=30% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=15% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
