## Step 1: Understanding the given curve
The curve has a minimum turning point at (-2, -1), crosses the x-axis at (-3, 0) and (-1, 0), and crosses the y-axis at (0, 3).

## 2: Identifying the form of the equation
Given the x-intercepts are (-3, 0) and (-1, 0), the equation of the curve can be written in the form \(y = a(x + 3)(x + 1)\), where \(a\) is a constant.

## 3: Finding the value of \(a\)
To find \(a\), we use the point (0, 3) through which the curve passes: \(3 = a(0 + 3)(0 + 1)\). This simplifies to \(3 = 3a\), so \(a = 1\).

## 4: Writing the equation of the curve
Substituting \(a = 1\) into the equation from Step 2 gives \(y = (x + 3)(x + 1)\).

## 5: Comparing with the given options
Option A: \(y = (x + 1)(x + 3)\) is equivalent to \(y = (x + 3)(x + 1)\), so it matches our derived equation.

## 6: Analyzing the difficulty and potential misconceptions
The question might seem straightforward, but students could make errors if they misinterpret the coordinates of the intercepts or the form of the equation. However, given that the x-intercepts directly provide the roots of the equation, and the y-intercept allows for easy determination of \(a\), the question primarily tests recognition of the factored form of a quadratic equation and substitution of given points.

## 7: Predicting student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand the relationship between the intercepts and the equation. They might randomly select an option or choose based on incorrect interpretations of the graph. A=40% (due to direct matching of intercepts), B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here should recognize the x-intercepts but might struggle with substituting the y-intercept correctly or understanding the implications of the turning point. A=60%, B=15%, C=15%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily identify the correct equation using the x and y intercepts. A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only quickly identify the correct equation but also possibly verify it with the turning point. A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%.

## 8: Finalizing predictions
Given the analysis, here are the predictions in the required format:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
