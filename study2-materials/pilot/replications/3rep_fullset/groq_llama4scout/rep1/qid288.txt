To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question is:
\[
F=3^{a}
\]

What is the value of \( F \) when \( a=-5 \) ?

## Step 1: Understand the Question
The question requires students to apply the concept of negative exponents. When \( a = -5 \), \( F = 3^{-5} \). This can be rewritten as \( F = \frac{1}{3^5} \).

## 2: Calculate the Correct Answer
\( 3^5 = 243 \), so \( F = \frac{1}{243} \). This corresponds to option D.

## 3: Identify Potential Misconceptions
- A common misconception might be to confuse negative exponents with negative numbers or to incorrectly apply the exponent rule. For example, some students might think \( 3^{-5} = -3^5 \) or \( 3^{-5} = -5^3 \), which are incorrect.
- Another misconception could be not understanding that a negative exponent indicates taking the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive exponent.

## 4: Analyze Options
- Option A: \( -243 \) would be incorrect because it suggests \( 3^{-5} = -3^5 \), which is not true.
- Option B: \( -\frac{1}{243} \) suggests a misunderstanding of how negative exponents work, as it incorrectly introduces a negative sign.
- Option C: \( -15 \) does not relate to the calculation of \( 3^{-5} \) and seems to confuse the exponent with multiplication or another operation.
- Option D: \( \frac{1}{243} \) is the correct answer, based on the calculation \( 3^{-5} = \frac{1}{3^5} = \frac{1}{243} \).

## 5: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand exponents well, let alone negative exponents. They might choose A, B, or C due to a lack of understanding. Option A might be chosen by those who mistakenly think \( 3^{-5} \) is equivalent to \( -3^5 \). Given the simplicity needed for such students, they might not even attempt to calculate, leading to a spread across incorrect options. Let's assume: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with negative exponents. They are more likely to choose A or B due to misconceptions about negative exponents. Let's assume: A=20% B=25% C=15% D=40%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand exponents and are less likely to make simple mistakes. They should mostly choose D, with some possibly choosing A or B due to lingering misconceptions. Let's assume: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%.
- **Advanced**: These students have a strong grasp of the concepts and are unlikely to make errors. They should nearly all choose D. Let's assume: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
