To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 30 \% \) of \( £ 120= \), let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls or ease of calculation.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires finding 30% of £120. This is a straightforward percentage calculation that can be solved by multiplying £120 by 0.3.

## 2: Calculating the Correct Answer
To find 30% of £120, we calculate \( 120 \times 0.3 = 36 \). Therefore, the correct answer is \( £ 36 \), which corresponds to option B.

## 3: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Errors
- A common misconception might involve confusing the percentage with the whole amount or miscalculating the percentage. For example, some might think 30% of £120 is £30 (option A), which would be a mistake. Others might incorrectly calculate it as \( 120 \times 3 = 360 \) (option D), or think 30% means taking 30% of 100% and subtracting from 120, leading to incorrect options.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic percentage calculations or misunderstand what 30% means. They might choose A (\( £ 30 \)) because they mistakenly think 30% of any amount is the same as 30 (a simplistic misunderstanding), or D (\( £ 360 \)) because they mistakenly multiply by 3 instead of 0.3. C (\( £ 90 \)) could be chosen if they mistakenly calculate 30% as three-quarters of the amount. The correct answer, B (\( £ 36 \)), might be challenging for them to achieve.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should have a basic understanding of percentages. They might still make errors but are more likely to understand the concept of 30% as 0.3. However, they could be tempted by A or C due to miscalculation or misunderstanding. B should be within their reach, but errors might still occur, possibly leading to distributions like A=20%, B=60%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level are expected to handle percentage calculations confidently. They should easily calculate 30% of £120 as £36. The incorrect options might still attract some due to carelessness or a quick mental math error, but B should be the clear favorite. A distribution like A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2% seems plausible.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are not only confident in their calculations but also less likely to fall for common misconceptions. They should all correctly identify B as the answer, with very few choosing the incorrect options. A distribution like A=1%, B=98%, C=1%, D=0% seems reasonable.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Given these considerations, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=1% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=1% D=0%
