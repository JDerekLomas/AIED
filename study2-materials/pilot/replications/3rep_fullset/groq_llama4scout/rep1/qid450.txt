To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or ease of calculation.

The question is: \(1 \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3}\).

First, let's solve it: \(1 \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3}\), so \(\frac{5}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6}{3} = 2\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for a correct way to write the answer to the calculation \(1 \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3}\). The correct answer is \(2\), which corresponds to option D.

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve incorrectly adding the fractions or converting between mixed numbers and improper fractions. However, in this case, the calculation is straightforward: converting \(1 \frac{2}{3}\) to an improper fraction (\(\frac{5}{3}\)), then adding \(\frac{1}{3}\) to get \(\frac{6}{3}\) or simply \(2\).

## 3: Evaluating Option A
Option A is \(\frac{4}{3}\). This would be a incorrect answer if students mistakenly calculated \(1 \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3}\) as \(1 \frac{3}{3} = 2\), but then incorrectly converted or simply added the fractions without converting to a common form properly.

## 4: Evaluating Option B
Option B is \(4\). This seems like an unlikely answer since the sum is clearly less than \(4\).

## 5: Evaluating Option C
Option C is \(3\). This could be a plausible incorrect answer if a student incorrectly added \(1 + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3}\) as \(1 + 1 = 2\) but then mistakenly added \(1\) more, or simply made a calculation error.

## 6: Evaluating Option D
Option D is \(2\), which is the correct answer.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic fraction addition and conversion. They might choose A (\(20\%\)), B (\(10\%\)), C (\(30\%\)), D (\(40\%\)) because they could get the correct answer by chance or through simple addition but are more likely to make errors.
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a grasp of basic fractions and mixed numbers. They might make simple errors: A (\(15\%\)), B (\(5\%\)), C (\(20\%\)), D (\(60\%\)).
- **Proficient:** Students here are more likely to understand the conversion and addition: A (\(5\%\)), B (\(0\%\)), C (\(5\%\)), D (\(90\%\)).
- **Advanced:** These students are highly confident in their calculations and unlikely to make simple errors: A (\(0\%\)), B (\(0\%\)), C (\(0\%\)), D (\(100\%\)).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=5% C=20% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=5% D=90%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
