To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential for students to make errors based on their ability levels.

The formula for the area of a triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\), or equivalently, \(\frac{\text{base} \times \text{height}}{2}\). For the given triangle with a base \(b = 5\) cm and perpendicular height \(h = 3\) cm, the area \(A\) can be calculated as:
\[A = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 3 = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \, \text{cm}^2\]

This question tests the understanding and application of the area formula for a triangle. The correct answer is \(7.5 \, \text{cm}^2\), which corresponds to option D.

## Step 1: Analyzing the Question for Potential Errors
The question is straightforward and directly tests the recall and application of a formula. There's no complex context or wording that could confuse students about what is being asked.

## 2: Considering Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with applying the formula or might not recall it. They could mistakenly use the formula for the area of a rectangle (\( \text{base} \times \text{height} \)) without halving, leading them to choose \(15 \, \text{cm}^2\) (option A), or they might choose randomly.
- **Basic:** Students at this level are expected to know the formula but might make careless errors. They are less likely to choose option C (\(30 \, \text{cm}^2\)) as it suggests doubling the correct area, which seems less plausible. Option B (\(4 \, \text{cm}^2\)) seems too low for a triangle of these dimensions.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level should easily recall and apply the formula, making option D (\(7.5 \, \text{cm}^2\)) the obvious choice. They are less likely to make errors.
- **Advanced:** These students not only know the formula but can also apply it in various contexts. They are unlikely to make any errors.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
Given the simplicity of the question and the direct application of a well-known formula:
- **Below Basic:** Might get it wrong by not halving (A=60%, B=10%, C=20%, D=10%)
- **Basic:** Should mostly get it right but might have some errors (A=20%, B=5%, C=10%, D=65%)
- **Proficient:** Expected to get it right (A=5%, B=0%, C=5%, D=90%)
- **Advanced:** Almost certainly get it right (A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%)

The best answer is D. 

Below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
Basic: A=20% B=5% C=10% D=65%
Proficient: A=5% B=0% C=5% D=90%
Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
