## Step 1: Understand the question and the table of values
The question provides a table of values for the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\) and asks to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\), denoted by \(\color{gold}\bigstar\).

## 2: Solve for \(y\) when \(x = 0\)
To find \(y\) when \(x = 0\), substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation \(4x + 2y = 10\).
\[4(0) + 2y = 10\]
\[0 + 2y = 10\]
\[2y = 10\]
\[y = 5\]

## 3: Analyze the options given
The options provided are:
A: \(20\)
B: \(3\)
C: \(5\)
D: \(2.5\)

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and errors
A common misconception could involve incorrect substitution or algebraic manipulation. However, given the simplicity of this problem and the direct substitution required, most students who understand basic algebra should be able to solve it correctly.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations or substitution. They might not correctly solve for \(y\) or might choose an option without calculation.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to perform simple algebraic operations but might make careless mistakes.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level should easily solve the equation and choose the correct answer.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only solve it correctly but also do so efficiently.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each ability level
Given the straightforward nature of the question, most students, even at the basic level, should be able to get it right if they follow the algebraic process correctly.

- **Below Basic**: A=10% (random guess), B=20% (another random guess), C=60% (correct, but through luck or simple guesswork), D=10% (random guess).
- **Basic**: A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=2%, B=2%, C=95%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: A=1%, B=1%, C=97%, D=1%.

## 7: Convert estimates into the required format
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%
