To approach this question, let's first understand what corresponding angles are. Corresponding angles are formed when two lines are cut by a transversal, and they occupy the same relative position at each intersection. 

Given the diagram described, angle \( p \) and its corresponding angle are on the same side of the transversal and on the same side of the lines cut by the transversal.

- Angle \( p \) is on the left side of the transversal.
- The corresponding angle to \( p \) would be on the right side of the transversal but in a similar relative position.

From the description:
- Angle A is vertically opposite to \( p \), making A and \( p \) vertically opposite angles, not corresponding angles.
- Angle B is co-interior to \( p \), which means B and \( p \) are on the same side of the transversal but inside the parallel lines, not corresponding angles.
- Angle C and its vertically opposite angle D are on the right side. 

Corresponding angles are equal and in the same relative position. The angle that is vertically opposite to angle C (which is D) is actually in the corresponding position to \( p \) because it is on the same side of its line and the transversal as \( p \) is to its line and transversal.

## Predicting Student Responses

### below_basic:
At this level, students might struggle with basic angle properties. 
- A=20% (some might mistakenly think vertically opposite angles are corresponding)
- B=30% (co-interior angles might be confused with corresponding angles)
- C=10% (might not understand the concept of corresponding angles well)
- D=40% (some might correctly identify corresponding angles or guess)

### basic:
Students at this level have a grasp of basic properties but might make simple mistakes.
- A=10% (less likely to confuse with vertically opposite)
- B=25% (still might confuse with co-interior)
- C=5% (unlikely to choose this)
- D=60% (most should correctly identify corresponding angles)

### proficient:
These students understand angle properties well and are less likely to make common mistakes.
- A=5% (unlikely to confuse with vertically opposite)
- B=10% (less likely to confuse with co-interior)
- C=5% (understand it's not that)
- D=80% (most will correctly identify)

### advanced:
At this level, students not only understand but can apply concepts accurately.
- A=0% (know it's not vertically opposite)
- B=5% (rarely confuse with co-interior)
- C=0% (know it's not that)
- D=95% (almost all will correctly identify)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=25% C=5% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=0% D=95%
