## Step 1: Understand the question and the concept being tested
The question asks for the gradient of a line that passes through the points (0,0) and (1,2). The gradient of a line is a measure of how steep it is and can be calculated using the formula: gradient = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points on the line.

## 2: Calculate the gradient of the line
Using the given points (0,0) and (1,2), we can calculate the gradient: gradient = (2 - 0) / (1 - 0) = 2 / 1 = 2.

## 3: Analyze the options given
The options provided are:
A: \( 0 \)
B: \( 2 x \)
C: \( 2 \)
D: \( 1 \)

## 4: Evaluate option A
Option A suggests a gradient of 0, which would be correct for a horizontal line. Since the line passes through (0,0) and (1,2), it is not horizontal, making option A incorrect.

## 5: Evaluate option B
Option B, \( 2 x \), suggests that the gradient is a function of x, which is not correct for a straight line. The gradient of a straight line is constant.

## 6: Evaluate option C
Option C suggests a gradient of 2, which matches our calculation in Step 2.

## 7: Evaluate option D
Option D suggests a gradient of 1, which does not match our calculation.

## 8: Consider student understanding at different levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with the concept of gradient or may not understand how to apply the formula. They might choose option A (0) because they mistakenly think the line is horizontal or choose option D (1) due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of gradients but might make simple calculation errors or misunderstand the concept. They are likely to choose option C (2) if they correctly apply the formula but might be tempted by option D (1) if they are unsure.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level understand the concept of gradient and can apply the formula correctly. They should predominantly choose option C (2).
- **Advanced**: Students at this advanced level not only understand the concept but are also less likely to be misled by incorrect options. They should also predominantly choose option C (2), with a high degree of confidence.

## 9: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the clear calculation involved:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (mistaking for a horizontal line), B=10% (misunderstanding of gradient as a variable), C=50% (correct calculation), D=20% (incorrect guess).
- **Basic**: A=5% (unlikely to think it's horizontal), B=5% (unlikely to suggest a variable gradient), C=80% (correct), D=10% (some confusion).
- **Proficient**: A=0% (know it's not horizontal), B=0% (know gradient is constant), C=95% (correct), D=5% (minor confusion).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (confident in non-horizontal nature), B=0% (confident in constant gradient), C=100% (correct and confident), D=0% (no confusion).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=50% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
