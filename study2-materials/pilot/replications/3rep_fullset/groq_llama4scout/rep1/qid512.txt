To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to function machines.

The question presents four pairs of function machines with different operations (multiplication and addition) applied in sequence. The correct application of these operations in a function machine is crucial, as the order of operations can significantly affect the outcome.

## Step 1: Understand the Operations in Function Machines
Function machines process input through a series of operations. The correct sequence is essential. For example, if the operations are "✕ 2" and then "+ 3", the correct output for an input \(p\) would be \(2p + 3\), not \(3 + 2p\), which would be incorrect.

## 2: Identify Common Misconceptions
A common misconception is not following the order of operations correctly or misunderstanding how the operations are applied sequentially. For instance, students might incorrectly apply the operations in the reverse order or misinterpret the sequence.

## 3: Analyze Each Option
- **Option A**: The first machine correctly represents \(2p + 3\), and the second machine also correctly represents \(2(3 + p) = 6 + 2p\), which matches the operations shown.
- **Option B**: The first machine is correct (\(2p + 3\)), but the second machine applies operations in a different order than shown, resulting in \(2p + 6\), not \(2(3 + p)\).
- **Option C**: The first machine incorrectly represents the sequence as \(2(p + 3) = 2p + 6\), not \(3 + 2p\), and the second machine is correct.
- **Option D**: Both machines in Option D incorrectly represent their sequences; the first machine should output \(2p + 6\) (not \(3 + 2p\)), and the second machine correctly represents \(2(p + 3) = 2p + 6\).

## 4: Determine Correctness
The correct pair should accurately reflect the sequence of operations. Let's correct and simplify:
- The expression for the first machine in all options is \(p \rightarrow \text{✕} 2 \rightarrow +3 \rightarrow 2p + 3\).
- For the second machine to match \(2(3 + p)\), it should be \(p \rightarrow +3 \rightarrow \text{✕} 2 \rightarrow 2(3 + p) = 6 + 2p\).

## 5: Match to Given Options
- **Option A** seems correct based on standard function machine processing: First machine \(p \rightarrow 2p \rightarrow 2p + 3\); Second machine \(p \rightarrow p + 3 \rightarrow 2(p + 3) = 2p + 6\).
- **Option B** is incorrect because the second machine doesn't match.
- **Option C** and **D** have mistakes based on operational sequences.

## 6: Estimated Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might guess), B=10%, C=30% (due to confusion), D=40% (as it seems plausible but incorrect).
- **Basic**: A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Proficient**: A=70%, B=10%, C=5%, D=15%.
- **Advanced**: A=90%, B=5%, C=0%, D=5%.

The best answer is A. 

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
