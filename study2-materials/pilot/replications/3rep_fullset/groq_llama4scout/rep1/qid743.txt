## Step 1: Understanding the Function Machine
The function machine takes an input \(x\), adds 10 to it, and then multiplies the result by 3. So, the correct output can be calculated as \(3(x + 10)\).

## 2: Calculating the Correct Output
To find the correct output, we simplify \(3(x + 10)\):
\[3(x + 10) = 3x + 30\].

## 3: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom says the output is \(3x + 30\). From Step 2, we know this is correct.

## 4: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie says the output is \(10 + 3x\). This can be rearranged as \(3x + 10\), which is not equal to \(3x + 30\). So, Katie is incorrect.

## 5: Determining the Correctness of Each Statement
- Tom is correct because \(3(x + 10) = 3x + 30\).
- Katie is incorrect because her expression \(10 + 3x\) does not match the correct output \(3x + 30\).

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic expressions and the order of operations. They might not correctly apply the operations in the function machine. Tom: 20% (some might guess), B: 10% (unlikely to guess correctly), C: 5% (unlikely to see both as correct), D: 65% (most might see that not both can be right but choose neither for wrong reasons).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of algebra but might make careless mistakes. Tom: 40% (some understand the sequence), B: 20% (some might mistakenly think Katie is right), C: 10% (few see both as correct), D: 30% (some recognize the incorrect statement).
- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of algebra and are less likely to make simple mistakes. Tom: 60% (most see Tom's correctness), B: 15% (some might still mistakenly support Katie), C: 5% (very few think both are correct), D: 20% (a few might doubt both for complex reasons).
- **Advanced**: These students have a deep understanding and can apply concepts accurately. Tom: 80% (most accurately identify Tom), B: 5% (very few would argue for Katie), C: 0% (none would think both are correct), D: 15% (a few might consider if there's an error in interpretation).

## 7: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis, let's correct and simplify the prediction based on typical student understanding and common misconceptions:
- **Below Basic**: A=20%, B=10%, C=5%, D=65%
- **Basic**: A=40%, B=20%, C=10%, D=30%
- **Proficient**: A=60%, B=15%, C=5%, D=20%
- **Advanced**: A=80%, B=5%, C=0%, D=15%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=5% D=65%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%
