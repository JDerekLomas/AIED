To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question asks for two numbers whose product is \(-24\). This requires an understanding of multiplying negative and positive numbers. A common misconception might involve struggling with the signs (e.g., forgetting that two negative numbers multiplied together give a positive result, and a negative and a positive number give a negative result).

## Step 1: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \(-3\) and \(-8\). The product of \(-3\) and \(-8\) is \(24\), not \(-24\), because multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result. So, this option is incorrect based on the product.

## 2: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \(-4\) and \(6\). The product of \(-4\) and \(6\) is \(-24\), which matches the requirement. This option is correct.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \(-10\) and \(-14\). The product of \(-10\) and \(-14\) is \(140\), not \(-24\), because, again, multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result. So, this option is incorrect.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D is \(-3\) and \(9\). The product of \(-3\) and \(9\) is \(-27\), not \(-24\). So, this option is incorrect.

## 5: Considering Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication facts and understanding of negative numbers. They might incorrectly choose options based on simple errors in calculation or misunderstanding of negative number rules. Option B seems like it could be a correct answer for those who understand negative and positive number multiplication, but given the nature of the question, it might also appeal to those who can calculate correctly.

- **Basic:** Students here have a basic grasp of multiplication and negative numbers. They are likely to eliminate obviously incorrect options (like C) and might choose B if they can calculate the product correctly.

- **Proficient:** These students are likely to quickly identify B as a correct option and may also realize that A and C are incorrect due to their product being positive. They might be less likely to choose D due to calculation errors.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students will quickly and accurately identify B as correct and recognize the errors in A, C, and D.

## 6: Estimating Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question for those with a basic understanding of negative numbers and multiplication:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (simple guess), B=40% (some understanding of negatives), C=20% (miscalculation), D=20% (another guess).
- **Basic:** A=10% (common misconception), B=70% (correct calculation), C=10% (error), D=10% (calculation mistake).
- **Proficient:** A=5% (less likely to make basic errors), B=90% (accurate calculation), C=3% (rare mistake), D=2% (unlikely calculation error).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (no errors), B=100% (accurate), C=0% (no errors), D=0% (no mistakes).

The best answer is B.
