To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( (-5)+(-2)= \), let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to adding negative numbers.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to add two negative numbers, \( -5 \) and \( -2 \). The correct answer involves understanding that when adding two negative numbers, the result is always negative, and you simply add their absolute values.

## 2: Identifying Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to subtract the numbers or to incorrectly apply the rules for adding positive and negative numbers. For instance, some students might mistakenly think that adding two negatives gives a positive result (which would lead to option B), or they might not correctly handle the operation, leading to incorrect sums.

## 3: Analyzing Option A - Correct Answer
The correct calculation is \( -5 + (-2) = -5 - 2 = -7 \). So, option A is the correct answer.

## 4: Analyzing Options B, C, and D
- Option B (\( 7 \)) would be incorrect because it suggests that \( -5 + (-2) = 7 \), which violates the rule that adding two negative numbers results in a negative number.
- Option C (\( 3 \)) seems to come from a misunderstanding or miscalculation, possibly confusing the operation with subtraction or incorrectly handling negative signs.
- Option D (\( -3 \)) could result from a miscalculation, such as \( -5 - (-2) \) or a similar incorrect operation.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level often struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding negative numbers. They might choose B (thinking two negatives make a positive), C (miscalculation), or D (incorrectly subtracting or misunderstanding). A=40% (some understand basic addition of negatives), B=30% (misconception about negatives), C=15% (random error), D=15% (incorrect calculation).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors. They are more likely to get it right but could be swayed by misconceptions. A=60% (correct understanding), B=20% (still holding misconceptions), C=5% (simple mistake), D=15% (miscalculation).
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of adding negative numbers. Errors are less likely but could occur due to carelessness. A=90% (strong understanding), B=5% (occasional lapse), C=0% (unlikely), D=5% (rare mistake).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can apply concepts with confidence. Errors are minimal. A=95% (excellent understanding), B=0% (very rare), C=0% (extremely unlikely), D=5% (a rare, careless mistake).

## 6: Formatting the Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
- **basic**: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
