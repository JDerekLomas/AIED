To approach this question, let's first understand what it means for lines to be parallel. Lines are parallel if they have the same slope but different intercepts. The given line is $y = -2x + 7$, which means it has a slope of $-2$.

## 1. Analyzing Option A
Option A is $3y = -6x - 8$. To compare it with the given line, we should rewrite it in slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope. Dividing every term by 3 gives $y = -2x - \frac{8}{3}$. This line has a slope of $-2$, so it is parallel to the given line.

## 2. Analyzing Option B
Option B is $y = -(8 - 2x)$. Simplifying this gives $y = -8 + 2x$ or $y = 2x - 8$. This line has a slope of $2$, which is not equal to $-2$. Therefore, it is not parallel to the given line.

## 3. Analyzing Option C
Option C is $y = 2 - 2x$. This can be rewritten as $y = -2x + 2$. It has a slope of $-2$, making it parallel to the given line.

## 4. Analyzing Option D
Option D is $y = 2(1 - x)$. Simplifying this gives $y = 2 - 2x$. This also has a slope of $-2$, making it parallel to the given line.

## 5. Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with rewriting equations into slope-intercept form and understanding the concept of parallel lines. They might be confused by the different forms of the equations. Option B stands out as not parallel because it's the only one that doesn't obviously have a slope of $-2$ when quickly glanced at, but actual calculation or deeper understanding is needed to confirm. Expect a high chance of error across all options, but particularly with those requiring algebraic manipulation. 
  - A: 20% (some might recognize it as parallel)
  - B: 40% (might look not parallel due to different slope)
  - C: 20% (could think it's parallel)
  - D: 20% (could think it's parallel)

- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp of linear equations but might still make careless mistakes or not fully understand the implications of slope. They are more likely to correctly identify parallel lines but could be tricked by the algebraic form.
  - A: 10% (recognize it's parallel)
  - B: 60% (identify as not parallel)
  - C: 10% (think it's parallel)
  - D: 10% (think it's parallel)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of slope and can apply it well. They should easily identify that options A, C, and D are parallel and option B is not.
  - A: 5% (know it's parallel)
  - B: 90% (correctly identify as not parallel)
  - C: 5% (know it's parallel)
  - D: 5% (know it's parallel)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them quickly and accurately. They will have no trouble identifying the correct answer.
  - A: 0% (know it's parallel)
  - B: 100% (correctly identify as not parallel)
  - C: 0% (know it's parallel)
  - D: 0% (know it's parallel)

Given this analysis, the predicted percentages for each ability level are:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=5% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
