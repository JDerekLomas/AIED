## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a triangle with one angle given as 40 degrees and another as 32 degrees. The task is to find the size of the third angle, labelled \( k \). This is a basic property of triangles; the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
A common misconception might involve incorrectly applying properties of triangles or forgetting the basic property that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. However, this question seems straightforward as it directly tests the understanding of this property without any complex context that might trigger additional misconceptions.

## 3: Calculating the Correct Answer
To find \( k \), we subtract the given angles from 180 degrees: \( k = 180\degree - 40\degree - 32\degree = 108\degree \). Therefore, the correct answer is \( C = 108\degree \).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic or understanding of geometric properties. They might not know that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees or might make calculation errors. Option B (\( 90\degree \)) could be tempting for those who mistakenly think the triangle is a right triangle, but given the context, most would likely try to add or subtract the given angles without a clear strategy. Thus, incorrect options might be chosen due to misunderstandings or miscalculations. \( A=20\%, B=30\%, C=30\%, D=20\% \).
- **Basic**: Students at this level understand basic geometric properties but might make some calculation errors. They are more likely to recognize the need to use 180 degrees but could miscalculate: \( A=10\%, B=10\%, C=70\%, D=10\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to understand the property and calculate correctly. Mistakes would be less common: \( A=5\%, B=5\%, C=85\%, D=5\% \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of geometric properties and are less likely to make errors: \( A=0\%, B=0\%, C=95\%, D=5\% \) (the 5% could be due to careless mistakes).

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the basic property it tests, most students, even at lower levels, should be able to get it right if they recall that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. The predictions are:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
- basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
