To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question involves determining the distance of points from the origin using the distance formula, which is \(\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\). For a point \((x, y)\), its distance from the origin \((0, 0)\) is \(\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Claim
Tom claims that \((3, -2)\) and \((2, -3)\) are equidistant from the origin. Let's calculate their distances:
- Distance of \((3, -2)\) from the origin: \(\sqrt{3^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4} = \sqrt{13}\).
- Distance of \((2, -3)\) from the origin: \(\sqrt{2^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9} = \sqrt{13}\).
So, Tom is correct.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Claim
Katie claims that \((4, 1)\) and \((7, -2)\) are equidistant from the origin. Let's calculate their distances:
- Distance of \((4, 1)\) from the origin: \(\sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{16 + 1} = \sqrt{17}\).
- Distance of \((7, -2)\) from the origin: \(\sqrt{7^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 4} = \sqrt{53}\).
So, Katie is incorrect.

## 4: Evaluating Student Responses
Given the calculations:
- Tom is correct, and Katie is incorrect, which means the correct answer is A: Only Tom.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of distance from the origin and calculating using the distance formula. They might not even attempt to calculate or might confuse the coordinates. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, potentially spread across A, B, C, and D, but with a significant proportion choosing D (Neither is correct) due to a lack of understanding.

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make calculation errors or not fully grasp the implications of their calculations. They might correctly identify Tom but struggle with Katie or vice versa, or choose D. There's a chance they could get it right, but errors in calculation or conceptual understanding might lead to A, B, or D.

- **Proficient**: These students understand the distance formula and can apply it accurately. They are likely to correctly identify Tom's claim as true and Katie's as false, leading to a higher percentage choosing A: Only Tom.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the formula but can also quickly assess the validity of claims. They are likely to have no issues with calculations and will accurately determine that only Tom is correct.

## 6: Assigning Percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
- **Basic**: A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%
- **Proficient**: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
- **Advanced**: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
