## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question involves enlarging a triangle by a scale factor of 3 with the centre of enlargement at (1,0) and finding the new coordinates of point T, which is currently at (3,1).

## 2: Recall the formula for enlargement
To enlarge a point by a scale factor \(k\) with the centre of enlargement at \((h, j)\), the new coordinates \((x', y')\) of a point \((x, y)\) are given by:
\[x' = h + k(x - h)\]
\[y' = j + k(y - j)\]
Substituting \(k = 3\), \((h, j) = (1, 0)\), and \((x, y) = (3, 1)\) into the formula gives:
\[x' = 1 + 3(3 - 1) = 1 + 3 \cdot 2 = 1 + 6 = 7\]
\[y' = 0 + 3(1 - 0) = 0 + 3 \cdot 1 = 3\]
So, the new coordinates of point T are \((7, 3)\).

## 3: Analyzing potential misconceptions and student errors
A common misconception could be not applying the formula correctly or misunderstanding the concept of enlargement. Another error could be in calculating the distances or not using the centre of enlargement properly.

## 4: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with applying the formula or understanding the concept of scale factor and centre of enlargement. They might choose an option that doesn't require calculation, like B (1,3), or make a simple arithmetic mistake, leading to C (6,4) or D (9,3).
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the concept but struggle with the arithmetic. They could incorrectly calculate or apply the scale factor, possibly choosing B, C, or D due to miscalculation.
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to apply the formula correctly and calculate the new coordinates. They are likely to choose A (7,3) as it matches the correct calculation.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but are also likely to double-check their work. They should also choose A (7,3) but with a higher confidence level.

## 5: Estimating percentages for each option
Given the correct answer is A (7,3), and considering the nature of the question:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might get it by chance or partial understanding), B=30% (simple mistake or misunderstanding), C=20% (error in calculation), D=30% (another type of error).
- **Basic**: A=60% (most should get it but with some errors), B=15% (minor misunderstanding), C=10% (calculation error), D=15% (different error).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (correct application of formula), B=5% (minor error), C=5% (calculation mistake), D=10% (another mistake).
- **Advanced**: A=90% (confident in their calculation), B=2% (unlikely to make a simple mistake), C=3% (rare calculation error), D=5% (uncommon error).

## 6: Finalizing percentages
Based on typical student performance and the specific question:
- **Below Basic**: A=20%, B=30%, C=20%, D=30%
- **Basic**: A=60%, B=15%, C=10%, D=15%
- **Proficient**: A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%
- **Advanced**: A=90%, B=2%, C=3%, D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=3% D=5%
