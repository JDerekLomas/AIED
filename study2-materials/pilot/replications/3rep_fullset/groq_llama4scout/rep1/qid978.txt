To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 100^{3}= \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question requires the calculation of \( 100^{3} \), which means \( 100 \times 100 \times 100 \). A common misconception might involve misunderstanding the exponentiation, such as thinking \( 100^{3} \) means \( 100 + 100 + 100 \) (which would be a very basic and incorrect understanding), or mistakenly calculating it as \( 100 \times 3 \) or similar simple arithmetic errors.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question is \( 100^{3} = \). This is a straightforward calculation of \( 100 \) to the power of \( 3 \), which equals \( 1,000,000 \) or \( 1000000 \).

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
- A common error might be to confuse \( 100^{3} \) with \( 100 \times 3 = 300 \), leading to option D.
- Another error could be adding \( 100 \) three times: \( 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 \), again leading to option D, or mistakenly thinking it's \( 1003 \) (option B), which might come from a confusion with how to apply the exponent.
- The correct calculation, \( 100 \times 100 \times 100 = 1,000,000 \) or \( 1000000 \), corresponds to option C.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to struggle significantly with the concept of exponentiation and might resort to very basic or incorrect calculations. They might choose D (\( 300 \)) because it seems like a simple addition or multiplication error, or B (\( 1003 \)) if they misunderstand the operation entirely. Option A (\( 100000 \)) seems too high for a simple mistake but could be considered by some as a "large number." However, most would likely choose D or B due to fundamental misunderstandings.

## 4: Making Predictions
- **Below Basic**: A=10% B=30% C=40% D=20%
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of mathematics but might still struggle with the concept of cubing a number. They are more likely to recognize that \( 100^{3} \) is a large number but might not calculate it correctly. So, A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%
- **Proficient**: Students here should have a solid grasp of mathematical operations, including exponentiation. They are likely to calculate \( 100^{3} \) correctly as \( 1000000 \), so A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand but can apply mathematical concepts with ease. They would almost certainly choose the correct answer, C.

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=10% B=30% C=40% D=20%
- **Basic**: A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%
- **Proficient**: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=99% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=99% D=1%
