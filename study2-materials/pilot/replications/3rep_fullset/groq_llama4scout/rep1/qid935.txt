## Step 1: Understand the question and the common misconception
The question presents a simultaneous equation: \(2j - k = -10\), with \(k = 8\). The task is to solve for \(j\). A common misconception in solving equations is incorrect substitution or manipulation of terms.

## 2: Solve the equation to identify the correct answer
Substitute \(k = 8\) into the equation: \(2j - 8 = -10\). Add 8 to both sides: \(2j = -2\). Divide both sides by 2: \(j = -1\).

## 3: Identify the correct answer choice
The correct solution yields \(j = -1\), which corresponds to option D.

## 4: Analyze the difficulty and potential misconceptions
This question requires simple substitution and solving for one variable. The main potential error could be in the substitution or the arithmetic operations. Given \(k = 8\), students need to correctly substitute \(k\) and then solve for \(j\).

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly substitute \(k\) or perform arithmetic operations. Option A (\(j = 1\)), B (\(j = 9\)), and C (\(j = -9\)) could be tempting if students make simple arithmetic mistakes or misunderstand the substitution. For example, adding 8 instead of subtracting, or dividing by 2 incorrectly.
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to substitute \(k = 8\) correctly but might make simple arithmetic errors. For instance, \(2j - 8 = -10\) becomes \(2j = -2\) correctly, but then \(j = -2 / 2 = -1\) should be derived correctly. Errors might still occur due to hasty calculations.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve the equation with minimal errors. They understand algebraic manipulations and should correctly find \(j = -1\).
- **Advanced**: This group of students should not only solve it correctly but also quickly. They are less likely to fall into common traps.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (simple addition/subtraction mistake), B=10% (possibly incorrect handling of negative numbers), C=30% (more significant calculation error), D=40% (gets it right or guesses correctly).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=5%, C=15%, D=70% (most get it right with some errors).
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=2%, C=5%, D=88% (almost all get it right).
- **Advanced**: A=2%, B=1%, C=2%, D=95% (nearly all solve correctly).

## 7: Format the predictions
Given the analysis, here are the formatted predictions:

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=15% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=5% D=88%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=2% D=95%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=15% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=5% D=88%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=2% D=95%
