## Step 1: Understand the task
To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question about factorising the expression \(3x^{2} + 5x + 2\).

## 2: Factorise the expression
First, let's factorise the given quadratic expression \(3x^{2} + 5x + 2\). We look for two numbers that multiply to \(3 \times 2 = 6\) and add to \(5\). These numbers are \(2\) and \(3\) because \(2 \times 3 = 6\) and \(2 + 3 = 5\). So, we can rewrite the expression as \(3x^{2} + 2x + 3x + 2\) and then factorise by grouping: \(x(3x + 2) + 1(3x + 2) = (3x + 2)(x + 1)\).

## 3: Identify the correct answer
From the factorisation, the correct answer is \(B: (3x + 2)(x + 1)\).

## 4: Analyze potential misconceptions and difficulties
- A common misconception might involve incorrect factorisation, such as trying to factorise the quadratic into two binomials without properly finding the factors of \(6\) that add up to \(5\), or mistakenly applying the quadratic formula or completing the square when factorisation is possible.
- The expression given does not have an obvious factorisation that would lead to a simple factorisation error like \((3x+1)(3x+2)\) or \((3x+2)(3x+1)\), as these do not multiply to give \(3x^{2} + 5x + 2\).

## 5: Consider student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and may not know how to factorise a quadratic expression or might try to force factorisation into incorrect forms.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the concept of factorisation but could make simple errors or not know how to apply it to all types of quadratics.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to be able to factorise quadratic expressions correctly, recognising when a quadratic can be factored into the product of two binomials.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are likely to not only factorise correctly but also to do so efficiently and understand the implications of their factorisation.

## 6: Predict student responses
- **Below Basic**: \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 40\%\), \(D = 30\%\). Struggling with basic concepts, they might guess or incorrectly apply simple factorisation rules.
- **Basic**: \(A = 15\%\), \(B = 60\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 15\%\). They have a better grasp but might still make minor errors.
- **Proficient**: \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 80\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 10\%\). Competent in factorisation, they are likely to get it right.
- **Advanced**: \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 95\%\), \(C = 0\%\), \(D = 5\%\). Very confident and skilled, they will almost always choose the correct option.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
