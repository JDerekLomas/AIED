## Step 1: Understand the question and the ratio given
The question provides a ratio for mixing blue and yellow paint to make green paint, which is \( 5: 3 \) for blue to yellow. The table gives \( 1500 \, \mathrm{ml} \) of blue paint and asks for the amount of yellow paint, denoted by \( \bigstar \).

## 2: Calculate the amount of yellow paint needed
To find the amount of yellow paint, we first determine the factor by which the ratio \( 5: 3 \) is multiplied to get \( 1500 \, \mathrm{ml} \) of blue paint. Since \( 5 \times \mathrm{factor} = 1500 \), the factor is \( 1500 / 5 = 300 \). Then, we multiply the yellow part of the ratio by this factor: \( 3 \times 300 = 900 \, \mathrm{ml} \).

## 3: Analyze the difficulty of the question
This question tests the ability to apply a given ratio to find a missing quantity. It does not inherently contain a misconception trap but requires a straightforward calculation based on the given ratio and one known quantity.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with ratios or applying them to find missing values. They might not understand how to use the ratio to calculate the yellow paint or could add/subtract the given numbers incorrectly. Option C (\( 900 \, \mathrm{ml} \)) is the correct answer, but these students might choose incorrectly, possibly picking A (\( 2500 \, \mathrm{ml} \)) if they mistakenly add or multiply incorrectly, or B (\( 1502 \, \mathrm{ml} \)) if they think the difference between blue and yellow should be minimal.
- **Basic**: Students here should have a grasp of ratios but might make simple calculation errors. They are likely to choose C (\( 900 \, \mathrm{ml} \)) but could be tempted by A if they mistakenly think the total parts are \( 5 + 3 = 8 \) and then try to find a "total" rather than just the yellow part.
- **Proficient**: These students understand ratios and can apply them accurately. They should easily calculate \( 900 \, \mathrm{ml} \) for yellow paint and choose C. Errors might come from miscalculation, but given the simplicity, most should choose C.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand ratios but can also apply them in various contexts efficiently. They should quickly identify the correct answer as C (\( 900 \, \mathrm{ml} \)) without hesitation.

## 5: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (overestimation), B=20% (small incorrect adjustment), C=40% (correct but possibly by chance), D=10% (extreme overestimation).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=2%, C=92%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: A=2%, B=1%, C=96%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=92% D=1%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=96% D=1%
