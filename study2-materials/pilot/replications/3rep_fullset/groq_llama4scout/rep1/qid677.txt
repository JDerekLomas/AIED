To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about the perimeter of a rectangle, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula \(P = 2l + 2w\), where \(l\) is the length and \(w\) is the width. In this case, the length of a short side (let's consider it as the width \(w\)) is labelled \(x\), and the length of a long side (let's consider it as the length \(l\)) is labelled \(y\). So, the correct formula for the perimeter would be \(P = 2x + 2y\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
- Option A: \(x + y\) suggests adding only one length and one width, which is incorrect for perimeter.
- Option B: \(2xy\) suggests multiplying the length and width and then doubling the product, which is incorrect for perimeter but correct for area.
- Option C: \(2x + 2y\) is the correct formula for the perimeter of the rectangle.
- Option D: \(xy\) suggests just multiplying the length and width, which gives the area, not the perimeter.

## 2: Analyzing Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of perimeter or might confuse it with area. They are likely to choose options that seem simple or familiar.
  - A: \(20\%\) (simple addition, might seem right but lacks understanding of perimeter)
  - B: \(30\%\) (could confuse with area formula or just pick a seemingly complex option)
  - C: \(30\%\) (some might remember or guess the correct formula)
  - D: \(20\%\) (area formula, might confuse with perimeter)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still struggle with applying formulas correctly.
  - A: \(15\%\) (less likely to choose this as they understand addition but not application)
  - B: \(20\%\) (might still confuse with area)
  - C: \(55\%\) (understand the concept, likely to choose correctly)
  - D: \(10\%\) (less likely to confuse with area)

- **Proficient:** Students at this level understand the concepts well and are less likely to make simple mistakes.
  - A: \(5\%\) (unlikely, as they know perimeter involves both sides)
  - B: \(10\%\) (unlikely, as they distinguish between perimeter and area)
  - C: \(80\%\) (likely to apply the formula correctly)
  - D: \(5\%\) (unlikely to confuse)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the formulas but can also apply them in various contexts.
  - A: \(0\%\) (unlikely, as they clearly understand perimeter)
  - B: \(0\%\) (clear distinction between perimeter and area)
  - C: \(95\%\) (confident application of the formula)
  - D: \(5\%\) (very unlikely, but might consider unusual or complex scenarios)

## 3: Conclusion
Given the above analysis:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=55% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
