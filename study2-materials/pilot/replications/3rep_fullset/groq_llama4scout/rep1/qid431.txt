To approach this question, let's first understand the conversion graph provided and what it's asking for. The graph shows a straight line conversion between pints and litres, with the line passing through the origin (0,0) and the point (35,20). 

## Step 1: Determine the scale of the graph
The graph's y-axis represents litres (from 0 to 50) and the x-axis represents pints (from 0 to 90). A point on the graph, (35,20), indicates that 35 litres are equivalent to 20 pints.

## 2: Calculate the conversion rate
To find out how many pints 50 litres are equivalent to, we first need to determine the conversion rate from litres to pints. Using the point (35,20), the conversion rate can be calculated as \( \frac{20 \text{ pints}}{35 \text{ litres}} \).

## 3: Apply the conversion rate to 50 litres
The conversion rate per litre to pints is \( \frac{20}{35} \) pints per litre. To find out how many pints 50 litres are, we multiply this rate by 50: \( 50 \times \frac{20}{35} \).

## 4: Perform the calculation
\( 50 \times \frac{20}{35} = \frac{1000}{35} \approx 28.57 \) pints.

## 5: Evaluate the answer choices
Given the calculation, the best estimate for 50 litres in pints is approximately 28-29 pints. Let's look at the options:
- A: \( 87 \) pints
- B: \( 23 \) pints
- C: \( 28 \) pints
- D: \( 85 \) pints

## 6: Assess student performance by ability level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with reading the graph or calculating the conversion. They might not accurately use the given point to estimate the conversion for 50 litres. Given the calculation is not overly complex but does require some understanding of ratios, these students might be more likely to choose an option that doesn't require detailed calculation, such as A or D, due to a lack of understanding or miscalculation. However, without precise calculation skills, they might also consider B as it's lower and could seem more "reasonable" if they underestimate. So, \( A=20\%, B=40\%, C=20\%, D=20\% \).

- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to understand the concept of conversion graphs and perform simple calculations. They might still make errors in estimation but are more likely to get close. Given the estimate of approximately 28.57 pints, they might accurately choose C or make a minor error. So, \( A=5\%, B=15\%, C=70\%, D=10\% \).

- **Proficient**: These students should accurately read the graph, understand the conversion, and calculate or estimate correctly. They are likely to choose C as it's the closest to the calculated value of approximately 28.57 pints. So, \( A=0\%, B=5\%, C=90\%, D=5\% \).

- **Advanced**: Advanced students will not only accurately calculate but also consider the context and precision of the question. They are highly likely to choose C as it's the best estimate. So, \( A=0\%, B=0\%, C=95\%, D=5\% \).

The best answer is C. 

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=15% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
