To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie and evaluate their validity.

## Step 1: Evaluate Tom's statement
Tom says \( 918 \div 34 = 934 \div 18 \). To check if Tom is correct, we can calculate both divisions and see if they are equal.

## 2: Calculate Tom's divisions
\( 918 \div 34 \approx 27 \)
\( 934 \div 18 \approx 51.89 \)

These are not equal, so Tom is incorrect.

## 3: Evaluate Katie's statement
Katie says \( 918 \div 34 = 34 \div 918 \). This statement can be checked by calculating both sides.

## 4: Calculate Katie's divisions
\( 918 \div 34 \approx 27 \)
\( 34 \div 918 \approx 0.037 \)

These are not equal, so Katie is also incorrect.

## 5: Consider the misconception
The misconception here seems to be about the properties of division, specifically the commutative property, which does not apply to division (i.e., \( a \div b \neq b \div a \) in general). Both Tom and Katie are making errors based on a misunderstanding of division properties.

## 6: Analyze the question's difficulty and potential student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand division or might confuse operations. They might incorrectly think Tom or Katie is right due to a lack of understanding of division properties. Given the straightforward nature of the calculations, most might realize both statements are wrong but could struggle to articulate why. \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 50\% \)
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding of division. They might see that Tom's and Katie's statements are incorrect but could be more likely to recognize that division is not commutative. \( A = 15\% \), \( B = 15\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 65\% \)
- **Proficient**: These students understand division well and should easily see that both statements are incorrect. They know division is not commutative and can perform the calculations or reason through the properties. \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 2\% \), \( D = 88\% \)
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding of mathematical operations and their properties. They will quickly identify both statements as incorrect and understand why. \( A = 2\% \), \( B = 2\% \), \( C = 1\% \), \( D = 95\% \)

The best answer is below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=5% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=2% D=88%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=1% D=95%
