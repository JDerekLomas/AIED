To solve this, let's consider how students at different levels might approach the question.

The question asks for \( 4 \% \) of \( 200 \). To find \( 4 \% \) of \( 200 \), we calculate \( 0.04 \times 200 = 8 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question is straightforward and tests the understanding of percentages. \( 4 \% \) means \( 4 \) out of \( 100 \) or \( 0.04 \) in decimal form.

## 2: Analyzing Potential Errors
A common error might be to add \( 4 \% \) to \( 200 \) (thinking \( 200 + 4\% \) of \( 200 \) or similar misconceptions), or to misunderstand what \( 4 \% \) of \( 200 \) means. However, given the simplicity of the numbers involved (\( 4 \% \) and \( 200 \)), and the fact that \( 4 \% \) of \( 100 \) is \( 4 \), it's reasonable to assume \( 4 \% \) of \( 200 \) would be \( 8 \), as \( 200 \) is \( 2 \times 100 \).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with even basic percentage calculations. They might incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the concept of percentages. Given the options, they might choose \( A = 4 \) (thinking \( 4 \) percent directly relates to \( 4 \)), \( B = 204 \) (adding \( 4 \) to \( 200 \)), or \( D = 8 \) if they somehow manage to get it right or guess. The calculation \( 4 \% \) of \( 200 = 8 \) seems challenging, so \( C = 80 \) might be less likely. Let's assume: \( A = 30\% \), \( B = 25\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 35\% \).

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple calculation errors. They are more likely to understand \( 4 \% \) as \( 0.04 \) but might struggle with the multiplication or understanding the question. So, they might get \( D = 8 \) correct, or make simple mistakes leading to \( A = 4 \) or \( B = 204 \). Let's assume: \( A = 15\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 70\% \).

- **Proficient:** These students are likely to understand percentages well and perform calculations accurately. They should easily calculate \( 4 \% \) of \( 200 \) as \( 8 \), choosing \( D = 80\% \). Errors are less likely but could occur due to miscalculation: \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 85\% \).

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand percentages but are also adept at more complex calculations. They would quickly and accurately calculate \( 4 \% \) of \( 200 \) to be \( 8 \), with very few errors. Let's assume: \( A = 2\% \), \( B = 2\% \), \( C = 1\% \), \( D = 95\% \).

## 4: Final Predictions
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the calculations involved, most students, even at the basic level, should be able to get it right, especially since the numbers are easy to work with.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=10% D=35%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=5% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=1% D=95%
