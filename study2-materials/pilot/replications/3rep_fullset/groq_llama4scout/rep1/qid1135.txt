## Step 1: Understand the question and the equation given
The equation provided is $y = 6 - x$. The table of values gives $y = 8$, and we need to find the value of $x$ that corresponds to this $y$.

## 2: Substitute the given $y$ value into the equation to find $x$
Substituting $y = 8$ into the equation $y = 6 - x$, we get $8 = 6 - x$. To solve for $x$, we rearrange the equation: $x = 6 - 8$, which simplifies to $x = -2$.

## 3: Analyze the potential for misconceptions or errors
The question requires substituting a given $y$ value into the equation and solving for $x$. This is a straightforward process but can be tricky if students are not careful with the algebra or if they mistakenly try to solve for $y$ when $x$ is given. However, in this case, the equation is simple, and the operation required (solving for $x$) is basic.

## 4: Consider the difficulty level for students at different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations or substituting values into an equation. They might incorrectly solve the equation or not understand how to use the given $y$ value to find $x$.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should be able to perform simple algebraic manipulations but might still make careless mistakes.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve the equation with minimal chance of error.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level will likely solve the equation correctly without any issues.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at each ability level
Given the equation and the solution $x = -2$:
- The correct answer is $D = -2$.
- A common mistake could be misinterpreting the equation or making a calculation error, leading to other options.

## 6: Estimate the percentages
- **Below Basic**: Might not understand the relationship or make significant errors. Option A ($-8$) could be chosen if they incorrectly solve for $x$ (e.g., $8 = 6 + x$, leading to $x = 2$, which is not an option, indicating a potential for random error). $A=30\%$, $B=20\%$, $C=20\%$, $D=30\%$
- **Basic**: Should have a better grasp but might still make simple algebraic errors. $A=10\%$, $B=10\%$, $C=10\%$, $D=70\%$
- **Proficient**: Errors should be minimal. $A=5\%$, $B=5\%$, $C=5\%$, $D=85\%$
- **Advanced**: Virtually no errors. $A=0\%$, $B=0\%$, $C=0\%$, $D=100\%$

## 7: Refine estimates based on the specific question
Considering the simplicity of the question and the direct substitution required:
- The question does not seem to trigger a specific common misconception strongly, other than basic algebraic error.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
