To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question presents a probability spinner divided into 5 equal sections, with 3 sections labeled with a purple number 6 and 2 sections labeled with a blue number 5. The task is to determine the correct sample space for the spinner.

## Step 1: Understanding the Sample Space
The sample space in probability is the set of all possible outcomes. For the given spinner, the outcomes are the numbers 5 and 6.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom says the sample space can be written as \( S=\{5,6\} \). This implies that each number (5 or 6) is considered a single outcome, regardless of how many times it appears on the spinner. This is a correct way to define the sample space for this spinner because it lists each distinct outcome.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie says the sample space can be written as \( S=\{5,5,6,6,6\} \). This suggests that each individual section of the spinner is considered a separate outcome. While this lists all possible outcomes in terms of individual sections, it over-specifies the sample space for most probability calculations, which typically focus on distinct outcomes.

## 4: Evaluating the Correctness of Statements
For a spinner with sections labeled 5 and 6, the sample space focusing on the distinct outcomes is indeed \( S=\{5,6\} \), making Tom correct. Katie's representation, \( S=\{5,5,6,6,6\} \), might seem to account for the frequency of each outcome but is not the standard way to express a sample space when the outcomes are distinct (like 5 or 6).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding what a sample space represents. They might not fully grasp the concept of outcomes in probability. Given the visual cue of the spinner, some might incorrectly think Katie is right because she lists outcomes that match the spinner's sections (A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of probability but might still be confused about how to list outcomes. They might lean towards Tom because they understand 5 and 6 are the outcomes, but some could be swayed by Katie's detailed listing (A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%).
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand that the sample space consists of distinct outcomes. They should recognize Tom is correct and Katie's list, while detailed, is not the conventional sample space (A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students would easily identify that Tom's \( S=\{5,6\} \) is the correct and conventional sample space. They might see Katie's as overly specific but understand both could be argued for in different contexts. However, they would primarily agree with Tom (A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%).

## 6: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
- **basic**: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
