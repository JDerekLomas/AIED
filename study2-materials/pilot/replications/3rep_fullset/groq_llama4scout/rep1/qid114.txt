## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks students to multiply out the brackets and simplify the given expression \(m(m+5)(m-5) \equiv m^{3} \bigstar \ m^{2} \triangle \ m \bigcirc\) to find what replaces the triangle (\(\triangle\)).

## 2: Expand and simplify the given expression
First, expand \((m+5)(m-5)\) to get \(m^2 - 25\). Then, multiply this by \(m\) to get \(m(m^2 - 25) = m^3 - 25m\).

## 3: Compare with the given form
The expression \(m^3 - 25m\) needs to be compared with \(m^{3} \bigstar \ m^{2} \triangle \ m \bigcirc\). It's clear that \(\bigstar = 0\) (since there's no \(m^2\) term), \(\triangle = 0\) (since there's no \(m\) term coefficient other than -25, implying \(\triangle\) corresponds to the coefficient of \(m\)), and \(\bigcirc = -25\).

## 4: Identify the coefficient of \(m\)
The coefficient of \(m\) in \(m^3 - 25m\) is -25. This implies that \(\triangle = -25\).

## 5: Analyze potential student errors
Students might struggle with expanding the brackets and simplifying, especially if they incorrectly apply the difference of squares formula or distribute incorrectly.

## 6: Consider common misconceptions
A common error could be forgetting to distribute the \(m\) correctly or misinterpreting the result of \((m+5)(m-5)\) as \(m^2 + 25\) or similar incorrect expansions.

## 7: Assess question difficulty by ability level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not even attempt to expand or simplify correctly and could choose randomly or based on incorrect simplifications.
- **Basic:** Students might understand the concept of expanding brackets but could make calculation errors.
- **Proficient:** Students should be able to expand and simplify correctly but might still make minor errors.
- **Advanced:** Students are likely to get it right as they have a strong understanding of algebra.

## 8: Predict student responses
Given the expression and common errors, let's predict:
- **Below Basic:** A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20% (random or incorrect guesses)
- **Basic:** A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10% (errors in calculation or understanding)
- **Proficient:** A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5% (mostly correct but some minor errors)
- **Advanced:** A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1% (high accuracy)

## 9: Adjust according to the triangle question
The question specifically asks about \(\triangle\), which corresponds to the coefficient of \(m\). The correct answer is \( \triangle = -25 \), which matches option A.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
