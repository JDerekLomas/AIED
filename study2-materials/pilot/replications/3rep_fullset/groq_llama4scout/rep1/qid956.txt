To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 30 \) grams = \(\bigstar \) milligrams, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls or ease of understanding it.

The conversion between grams and milligrams is a fundamental concept: \(1 \text{ gram} = 1000 \text{ milligrams}\). Therefore, to convert grams to milligrams, one multiplies by 1000.

## Step 1: Understanding the Conversion
To find out how many milligrams are in 30 grams, we multiply 30 by 1000, which equals 30,000 milligrams.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(3000\)
- Option B: \(300\)
- Option C: \(0.03\)
- Option D: \(30000\)

## 3: Identifying the Correct Answer
The correct calculation yields \(30 \times 1000 = 30,000\) milligrams, making option D the correct answer.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic conversions. They might not recall that \(1 \text{ gram} = 1000 \text{ milligrams}\) or might incorrectly apply the conversion factor.
  - A: \(20\%\) (guessing or incorrect conversion)
  - B: \(15\%\) (partial understanding, e.g., \(30 \times 10 = 300\))
  - C: \(10\%\) (likely a miscalculation or misunderstanding of the conversion)
  - D: \(55\%\) (some might remember the conversion or calculate it correctly)

- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic conversions but might make simple errors.
  - A: \(5\%\)
  - B: \(10\%\)
  - C: \(5\%\)
  - D: \(80\%\)

- **Proficient:** These students understand the conversion and can apply it accurately.
  - A: \(2\%\)
  - B: \(2\%\)
  - C: \(1\%\)
  - D: \(95\%\)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the conversion but can also handle more complex problems. They are less likely to make errors on simple conversions.
  - A: \(1\%\)
  - B: \(1\%\)
  - C: \(0.5\%\)
  - D: \(97.5\%\)

## 5: Formatting the Response
Given the analysis, here is the formatted response:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=1% D=95%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=0.5% D=97.5%
