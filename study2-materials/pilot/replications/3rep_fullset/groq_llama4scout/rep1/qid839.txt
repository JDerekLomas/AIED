To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The question requires students to compare numbers and understand the relationship between them, specifically focusing on the use of greater than (>) and less than (<) symbols to make a statement correct.

The numbers given are:
1. \(76426\)
2. \(76462\)
3. \(74662\)

We need to determine the relationship between the first two numbers and then between the second and third numbers to fill in the boxes correctly.

## Step1: Compare the first two numbers, \(76426\) and \(76462\).
\(76426 < 76462\), because \(76426\) is less than \(76462\). So, the blue box should contain a "less than" symbol (<).

##2: Compare the last two numbers, \(76462\) and \(74662\).
\(76462 > 74662\), because \(76462\) is greater than \(74662\). So, the orange box should contain a "greater than" symbol (>).

##3: Determine the correct option based on the comparisons.
From the comparisons:
- The blue box should have a "<" (less than) symbol.
- The orange box should have a ">" (greater than) symbol.

This matches option D: ![A blue box containing a "less than" symbol  and an orange box containing a "greater than" symbol]().

##4: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic comparisons or understanding the symbols. They might randomly select or choose based on a common misconception. However, given the straightforward nature of this question, even students who are below basic might be able to compare numbers and understand the basic concept of > and <, but they might not apply it correctly. So, they could be misled into choosing an option that seems "obvious" but incorrect, such as A or C. \(A=30\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=30\%\), \(D=20\%\).

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding and can compare numbers. They might still make mistakes due to not fully understanding the application of the symbols in this context or due to careless errors. \(A=15\%\), \(B=10\%\), \(C=15\%\), \(D=60\%\).

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of number comparisons and symbol usage. They should easily identify the correct relationship. \(A=5\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=85\%\).

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand but can also apply their knowledge with ease. They are less likely to make mistakes on straightforward comparisons like this. \(A=0\%\), \(B=0\%\), \(C=0\%\), \(D=100\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=15% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
