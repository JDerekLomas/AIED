To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question of simplifying the fraction \(\frac{9}{12}\), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to simplify the fraction \(\frac{9}{12}\). The correct simplification involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9 and 12, which is 3, and then dividing both the numerator and denominator by this GCD. Therefore, \(\frac{9}{12} = \frac{9 \div 3}{12 \div 3} = \frac{3}{4}\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception in simplifying fractions is not dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the same number or not using the greatest common divisor. Another error could be incorrectly identifying the GCD or not simplifying the fraction at all.

## 3: Analyzing Option A (\(\frac{3}{6}\))
To get \(\frac{3}{6}\), a student might have divided both 9 and 12 by 3 (which is correct for finding a simpler form but does not go far enough), resulting in \(\frac{3}{4}\), and then somehow mistakenly halved both the numerator and denominator again. However, directly getting \(\frac{3}{6}\) from \(\frac{9}{12}\) would typically involve dividing by 3 and then not simplifying \(\frac{3}{4}\) further to \(\frac{3}{6}\), indicating a misunderstanding.

## 4: Analyzing Option B (\(\frac{2}{6}\))
Getting \(\frac{2}{6}\) doesn't seem to follow a straightforward simplification error from \(\frac{9}{12}\), as there's no simple division that leads directly to this fraction from \(\frac{9}{12}\) without additional incorrect operations.

## 5: Analyzing Option C (\(\frac{3}{4}\))
This is the correct simplification of \(\frac{9}{12}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3.

## 6: Analyzing Option D (\(\frac{9}{12}\))
Choosing \(\frac{9}{12}\) indicates that the student did not attempt to simplify the fraction at all.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand fraction simplification. They might not attempt to simplify (D: 60%), or make significant errors (B: 20%, A: 15%), with few getting it right (C: 5%).
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding but might struggle with finding the GCD or simplifying. They might leave it as is (D: 40%), attempt but fail to simplify correctly (A: 30%, B: 10%), with a reasonable chance of getting it right (C: 20%).
- **Proficient:** These students are more likely to understand how to simplify fractions. They might still occasionally leave the fraction as is (D: 10%), but are more likely to get it right (C: 80%), with some potential for error (A: 5%, B: 5%).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to simplify fractions easily. They are very likely to get it right (C: 95%), with minimal errors or leaving it unsimplified (D: 3%, A: 1%, B: 1%).

## 8: Assigning Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=15% B=20% C=5% D=60%
- **basic:** A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- **advanced:** A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=5% D=60%
basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
