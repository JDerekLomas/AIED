To approach this question, let's first understand the properties of a regular hexagon and a square, and then apply this understanding to predict student responses.

## Step 1: Understanding Properties of Shapes
A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides and 6 equal angles. The sum of the interior angles of any polygon can be found using the formula \((n-2) \times 180^{\circ}\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a hexagon, this is \((6-2) \times 180^{\circ} = 720^{\circ}\). Since it's regular, each interior angle is \(720^{\circ} / 6 = 120^{\circ}\).

## 2: Understanding Square Properties
A square has 4 equal sides and 4 equal right angles, each measuring \(90^{\circ}\).

## 3: Analyzing the Question
The question asks for the size of angle \(a\), which is the angle between a regular hexagon and a square joined on one side. 

## 4: Calculating Angle \(a\)
To find angle \(a\), we need to consider the exterior angles of the shapes. The exterior angle of a regular hexagon is \(360^{\circ} / 6 = 60^{\circ}\) (since the interior angle is \(120^{\circ}\), the exterior angle can also be found by \(180^{\circ} - 120^{\circ} = 60^{\circ}\)). For a square, the exterior angle is \(90^{\circ}\).

## 5: Finding Angle \(a\)
The angle \(a\) is the supplement of the sum of the exterior angles of the hexagon and the square because it is the angle formed on the outside of both shapes where they meet. So, \(a = 360^{\circ} - (60^{\circ} + 90^{\circ}) = 360^{\circ} - 150^{\circ} = 210^{\circ}\).

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic geometry. They might not know the interior angles of a hexagon or square or might confuse them. A significant portion might choose \(D\) (Not enough information) because they don't understand how to use the given information. Some might randomly pick an answer. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 15\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 55\%\).
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might make simple mistakes. They know the angles in a square (\(90^{\circ}\)) but might not recall the exact angle in a hexagon. Some might incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the concept of \(a\). \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 60\%\), \(D = 10\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students understand the properties of regular polygons and can apply them. They are likely to calculate \(a\) correctly or understand it's related to the exterior angles. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 80\%\), \(D = 5\%\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can quickly and accurately apply geometric principles. They will likely get it right immediately. \(A = 0\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 95\%\), \(D = 0\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=95% D=0%
