To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it presents.

The question is: \(1 \frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3}\).

First, let's solve it: 
\(1 \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3}\), so \(\frac{5}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3} = 1 \frac{1}{3}\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for a correct way to write the answer to the calculation \(1 \frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3}\). The correct answer is \(1 \frac{1}{3}\), which corresponds to option A.

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not converting the mixed number to an improper fraction correctly or not handling the subtraction properly. For example, students might incorrectly subtract the fractions without converting \(1 \frac{2}{3}\) to an improper fraction, or they might forget to subtract \(\frac{1}{3}\) from the whole number part and the fraction part correctly.

## 3: Evaluating Option Choices
- Option A: \(1 \frac{1}{3}\) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \(\frac{2}{3}\) might seem plausible if one incorrectly performs the subtraction.
- Option C: \(\frac{1}{3}\) could be an error if a student misunderstands the subtraction process.
- Option D: \(1\) suggests a simplification error, possibly from \(1 \frac{1}{3}\) being incorrectly reduced.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with basic fraction operations and conversions. They might not accurately convert \(1 \frac{2}{3}\) to \(\frac{5}{3}\) or properly perform the subtraction.
- A: 20% (some might get it by chance or partial understanding)
- B: 30% (misinterpreting the subtraction)
- C: 20% (another form of miscalculation)
- D: 30% (simplifying incorrectly)

### basic
Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in converting between mixed numbers and improper fractions or in subtraction.
- A: 50% (correct calculation)
- B: 25% (some misunderstanding of fractions)
- C: 15% (basic error in calculation)
- D: 10% (over-simplification)

### proficient
Proficient students are expected to handle these calculations with ease but might still occasionally make minor errors.
- A: 80% (understand and correctly calculate)
- B: 10% (occasional mistake)
- C: 5% (rare error)
- D: 5% (rare oversimplification)

### advanced
Advanced students are likely to have a deep understanding and rarely make errors.
- A: 95% (confident and accurate calculation)
- B: 3% (very rare mistake)
- C: 1% (extremely rare error)
- D: 1% (occasionally, a highly unlikely simplification error)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
