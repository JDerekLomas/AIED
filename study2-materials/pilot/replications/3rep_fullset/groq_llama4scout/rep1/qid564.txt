To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( -5(m-7) \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The correct answer to the question is \( -5m + 35 \), which corresponds to option C. This requires applying the distributive property (or FOIL method for binomials) correctly: \( -5(m-7) = -5m + (-5)(-7) = -5m + 35 \).

## Step 1: Identify Common Misconceptions
A common misconception when multiplying out brackets with a negative sign in front is to forget to change the signs of the terms inside the brackets when multiplying. Another is to incorrectly apply the rules of signs.

## 2: Analyze Option A (\( 5m + 35 \)) - Incorrect Application of Signs
Option A suggests a complete misunderstanding of both the distributive property and the signs: \( 5m + 35 \) implies that \( -5 \) was incorrectly turned into \( +5 \) and the \( -7 \) was multiplied by \( 5 \) to give \( 35 \) without considering the negative sign.

## 3: Analyze Option B (\( -5m - 35 \)) - Incorrect Sign Change
Option B, \( -5m - 35 \), suggests that the student applied the multiplication correctly but forgot to change the sign of the \( -7 \) when multiplying by \( -5 \), resulting in \( -5m - 35 \).

## 4: Analyze Option D (\( 5m - 35 \)) - Incorrect Signs and Coefficients
Option D, \( 5m - 35 \), implies an incorrect handling of both the coefficient and the constant term, suggesting confusion with the signs and possibly a misinterpretation of the negative sign outside the brackets.

## 5: Consider Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to struggle significantly with algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly apply basic arithmetic operations or misunderstand the concept of negative numbers. They are more likely to choose options A or B due to a lack of understanding of how to distribute and handle negative signs.
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a foundational understanding but may still struggle with applying rules consistently, especially with negative numbers. They are likely to choose B or D due to mistakes in handling signs.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the algebraic process but may make occasional careless mistakes. They are likely to get the correct answer, C, but some might choose B due to momentary lapses in attention to signs.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students have a strong grasp of algebra and are less likely to make basic errors. They should predominantly choose the correct answer, C.

## 6: Estimate Percentages Based on Analysis
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (completely incorrect, reflecting confusion), B=40% (mistake in sign), C=20% (correct, surprisingly), D=10% (another incorrect combination).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=30%, C=50%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=10%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=5%, C=90%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
