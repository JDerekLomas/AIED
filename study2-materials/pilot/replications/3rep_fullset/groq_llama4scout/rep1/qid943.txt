## Step 1: Understand the concept of perpendicular lines in terms of slope.
For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be -1. The given line is \(y = 2x + 1\), which means its slope (\(m_1\)) is 2.

## 2: Determine the slope requirement for a line perpendicular to the given line.
If \(m_1 = 2\), then for a line with slope \(m_2\) to be perpendicular to it, \(m_1 \times m_2 = -1\). Therefore, \(2 \times m_2 = -1\), which implies \(m_2 = -\frac{1}{2}\).

## 3: Analyze option A.
Option A is \(y = 7 - \frac{1}{2}x\). This can be rewritten as \(y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 7\), meaning its slope (\(m\)) is \(-\frac{1}{2}\). This matches the requirement for being perpendicular to the given line.

## 4: Analyze option B.
Option B is \(y = 2x - 1\), which has a slope of 2. This line is parallel to the given line, not perpendicular.

## 5: Analyze option C.
Option C is \(x = 2y + 1\). To find its slope, we rearrange it into the form \(y = mx + b\): \(x - 1 = 2y\), then \(y = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{2}\). The slope here is \(\frac{1}{2}\), not \(-\frac{1}{2}\).

## 6: Analyze option D.
Option D is \(y = \frac{1}{2}x - 3\), which has a slope of \(\frac{1}{2}\). This does not match the requirement for being perpendicular to the given line.

## 7: Consider student understanding at different levels.
- **Below_basic:** Students at this level might struggle with rearranging equations and understanding the concept of slope and perpendicular lines. They might mistakenly choose lines with the same slope or no clear understanding of the perpendicular condition.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic algebra and the concept of slope but might make errors in calculations or identifying the correct slope relationship.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept of slope and perpendicular lines well and can apply it to find the correct answer.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also apply it quickly and accurately, even with more complex equations.

## 8: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below_basic:** A=40% (understanding the negative reciprocal), B=30% (same slope), C=15% (mistakenly rearranging or understanding), D=15% (random or incorrect slope).
- **Basic:** A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.

## 9: Convert predictions into the required format.
Given the analysis, the predicted percentages are:
- **below_basic:** A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
- **basic:** A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **proficient:** A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced:** A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
