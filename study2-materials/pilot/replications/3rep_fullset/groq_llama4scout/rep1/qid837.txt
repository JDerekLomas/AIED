## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question requires students to evaluate two expressions, \(h(j+2)\) and \(h(2+j)\), given that \(h=10\) and \(j=4\), and then determine which pair of statements about these expressions is true.

## 2: Evaluating \(h(j+2)\)
To evaluate \(h(j+2)\), we substitute \(h=10\) and \(j=4\) into the expression: \(10(4+2) = 10 \times 6 = 60\).

## 3: Evaluating \(h(2+j)\)
To evaluate \(h(2+j)\), we substitute \(h=10\) and \(j=4\) into the expression: \(10(2+4) = 10 \times 6 = 60\).

## 4: Comparing with the given options
- Option A: \(h(j+2)=60\) and \(h(2+j)=-60\). This cannot be true since both expressions equal 60, not -60 for the second one.
- Option B: \(h(j+2)=42\) and \(h(2+j)=24\). This is incorrect because \(h(j+2) = 60\), not 42, and \(h(2+j) = 60\), not 24.
- Option C: \(h(j+2)=24\) and \(h(2+j)=42\). This is incorrect because both expressions equal 60, not 24 and 42 respectively.
- Option D: \(h(j+2)=60\) and \(h(2+j)=60\). This matches our calculations.

## 5: Predicting student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substitution and order of operations. They might incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the expressions, potentially leading to a random or incorrect choice. Given the simplicity of the calculation, some might still arrive at the correct answer by chance or through trial and error, but errors in calculation are common. \(A=20\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=40\%\)
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebraic manipulations but might still make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are more likely to understand the structure of the problem but could miscalculate: \(A=10\%\), \(B=15\%\), \(C=15\%\), \(D=60\%\)
- **Proficient**: Students at this level are comfortable with algebraic expressions and less likely to make arithmetic errors. They should easily see that both expressions equal 60: \(A=5\%\), \(B=5\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=85\%\)
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand algebraic expressions but also can see through common misconceptions. They will almost certainly choose the correct option: \(A=0\%\), \(B=0\%\), \(C=0\%\), \(D=100\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
