To tackle this question, let's analyze it step by step, considering the common misconceptions and the specifics of the question.

The equation of the \( y \)-axis is a fundamental concept in coordinate geometry. The \( y \)-axis is the vertical line that passes through the origin, and its equation is \( x = 0 \). This is because any point on the \( y \)-axis has an \( x \)-coordinate of 0, regardless of its \( y \)-coordinate.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the equation of the \( y \)-axis. The correct answer is \( x = 0 \), which corresponds to option D.

## 2: Analyzing Option A (\( y = 1 \))
Option A, \( y = 1 \), represents a horizontal line that intersects the \( y \)-axis at \( y = 1 \). It's not the \( y \)-axis itself but a line parallel to the \( x \)-axis.

## 3: Analyzing Option B (\( y = 0 \))
Option B, \( y = 0 \), represents the equation of the \( x \)-axis, not the \( y \)-axis. This is a common misconception, as students might confuse the \( x \) and \( y \) axes.

## 4: Analyzing Option C (\( y = x \))
Option C, \( y = x \), represents a line with a slope of 1 that passes through the origin. It's not the \( y \)-axis but a line where \( x \) and \( y \) are equal.

## 5: Analyzing Option D (\( x = 0 \))
Option D, \( x = 0 \), is the correct equation of the \( y \)-axis. Any point on this line has an \( x \)-coordinate of 0.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic coordinate geometry. They may confuse the axes or not understand the concept of an equation representing a line. Thus, they might be more likely to choose incorrect options. \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 30\% \)
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding but might still make errors due to lack of practice or misunderstanding. \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 65\% \)
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are expected to know the equation of the \( y \)-axis. \( A = 1\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 2\% \), \( D = 92\% \)
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are highly unlikely to make mistakes on such a basic concept. \( A = 0\% \), \( B = 1\% \), \( C = 0\% \), \( D = 99\% \)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=10% D=65%
proficient: A=1% B=5% C=2% D=92%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=0% D=99%
