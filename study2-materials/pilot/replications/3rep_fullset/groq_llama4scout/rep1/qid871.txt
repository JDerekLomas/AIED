## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a compound shape in the form of an L and asks students to determine which of three methods (Paige, Kaci, David) correctly calculates the area of the shape. The shape has dimensions that form an L: the full width across the bottom is 9m, the partial width on the top is 5m, the full height on the left is 10m, and the partial height on the right is 6m.

## 2: Calculating the Area of the Shape
To assess the correctness of each student's method, we first need to calculate the total area of the L-shaped playground. This can be done by dividing the L shape into two rectangles: one with dimensions 10m x 5m and the other with dimensions 6m x 4m (since 9m - 5m = 4m and 10m - 6m = 4m), or alternatively, 9m x 6m and 5m x 4m, and then summing their areas.

## 3: Paige's Method
Paige's method is \(10 \times 6 + 5 \times 4\). Calculating this: \(10 \times 6 = 60\) and \(5 \times 4 = 20\), so \(60 + 20 = 80\).

## 4: Kaci's Method
Kaci's method is \(10 \times 5 + 9 \times 6\). Calculating this: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) and \(9 \times 6 = 54\), so \(50 + 54 = 104\).

## 5: David's Method
David's method is \(9 \times 10 - 6 \times 4\). Calculating this: \(9 \times 10 = 90\) and \(6 \times 4 = 24\), so \(90 - 24 = 66\).

## 6: Correct Calculation for Reference
The correct area can also be calculated directly by considering the L shape as a 9x10 rectangle minus a 4x6 rectangle (or other configurations). So, \(9 \times 10 = 90\) and \(4 \times 6 = 24\), thus \(90 - 24 = 66\). Alternatively, breaking it into a 5x10 and a 4x6 rectangle: \(5 \times 10 + 4 \times 6 = 50 + 24 = 74\), or into a 9x6 and a 5x4 rectangle: \(9 \times 6 + 5 \times 4 = 54 + 20 = 74\). The correct calculation yields an area of 74 square meters.

## 7: Evaluating Methods
- Paige: \(80\)
- Kaci: \(104\)
- David: \(66\)
- Correct area: \(74\)

## 8: Assessing Student Responses
- Paige's method yields 80, which is incorrect.
- Kaci's method yields 104, which is incorrect.
- David's method yields 66, which is incorrect.
Given that none of the provided calculations match the correct area of 74, but we need to assess who might choose each option based on common misconceptions.

## 9: Predicting Student Choices
- **below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with calculating areas and understanding the shape. They might randomly select or choose based on simplistic addition/subtraction without calculating, so A=30% B=30% C=30% D=10%.
- **basic**: At this level, students understand basic area calculations but might not fully decompose the shape correctly. They might choose Paige or Kaci due to straightforward calculations, A=40% B=40% C=15% D=5%.
- **proficient**: Proficient students can calculate areas and decompose shapes but might still fall into traps. They might recognize errors in Paige, Kaci, and David, so A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%.
- **advanced**: Advanced students will accurately calculate and assess each method. Given the obvious errors, they are likely to choose D if they understand that none are correct or if they find another correct method, A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=40% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
