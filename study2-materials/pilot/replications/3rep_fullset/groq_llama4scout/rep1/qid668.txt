To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question about finding the mode of the numbers \(0, 0, 2, 2\), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. In this case, both \(0\) and \(2\) appear twice, which is more than any other number. Therefore, the correct answer is A) \(0\) and \(2\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for the mode of a set of numbers: \(0, 0, 2, 2\). The mode is the number that appears most frequently. Here, \(0\) and \(2\) both appear twice, making them both modes.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might be to think that a data set can only have one mode. However, in statistics, if multiple values appear with the same highest frequency, then all these values are considered modes.

## 3: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A: \(0\) and \(2\), which is correct because both appear twice.
- Option B: \(2\), which is incorrect because it ignores \(0\).
- Option C: \(1\), which is incorrect because \(1\) does not appear in the data set.
- Option D: There is no mode, which is incorrect because there are values that appear more than once.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic concepts of mode or might not understand that a set can have more than one mode. They might choose Option D (There is no mode) because they don't recognize \(0\) and \(2\) as modes, or Option C (1) because they mistakenly think \(1\) is a mode. Option A seems straightforward but requires understanding of the definition of mode. 
  - Below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a better grasp of basic statistical concepts but might still be prone to simple errors. They are likely to understand what mode means but might not immediately think of multiple modes. 
  - Basic: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%

- **Proficient:** Students at this level have a solid understanding of statistical concepts, including the possibility of multiple modes. They should easily identify \(0\) and \(2\) as modes.
  - Proficient: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concept but are also familiar with more complex applications. They should have no trouble identifying the correct answer.
  - Advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
proficient: A=95% B=4% C=0.5% D=0.5%
advanced: A=99% B=1% C=0% D=0%
