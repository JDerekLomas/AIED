To approach this question, let's first understand what's being asked and the common misconceptions that might arise.

The question requires converting \(50 \mathrm{~m}\) into a percentage of \(5 \mathrm{~km}\). To solve it, one must first ensure both measurements are in the same units. Since \(1 \mathrm{~km} = 1000 \mathrm{~m}\), \(5 \mathrm{~km} = 5000 \mathrm{~m}\).

The calculation to find \(50 \mathrm{~m}\) as a percentage of \(5000 \mathrm{~m}\) is:
\[
\frac{50}{5000} \times 100 = \frac{1}{100} \times 100 = 1\%
\]

A common misconception might involve not converting the units properly or misunderstanding how to calculate percentages of quantities. However, the specific numbers here (\(50 \mathrm{~m}\) and \(5 \mathrm{~km}\)) might make the calculation straightforward for many students because \(50 \mathrm{~m}\) is easily recognizable as \(1/100\)th of \(5000 \mathrm{~m}\), suggesting a \(1\%\) solution.

Let's predict the performance based on ability levels:

### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with unit conversions and calculating percentages. The question might be challenging due to these basic skills.
- A: \(10 \%\) (thinking \(50 \mathrm{~m}\) is half of \(5 \mathrm{~km}\) or similar naive comparison)
- B: \(60 \%\) (correct calculation, but this might be an overestimation due to potential for error in basic calculations)
- C: \(20 \%\) (misinterpreting the fraction of \(5 \mathrm{~km}\) that \(50 \mathrm{~m}\) represents)
- D: \(10 \%\) (thinking it's \(10\%\), possibly due to incorrect scaling)

### basic
Students at this level should have a solid grasp of percentages and basic unit conversions.
- A: \(5 \%\) (only if they mistakenly think \(50 \mathrm{~m} = 5 \mathrm{~km}\))
- B: \(80 \%\) (most should calculate it correctly as \(1\%\))
- C: \(10 \%\) (some might mistakenly calculate or compare without conversion)
- D: \(5 \%\) (a few might incorrectly calculate)

### proficient
These students are expected to handle such questions with ease, understanding percentages, ratios, and unit conversions well.
- A: \(0 \%\) (unlikely to confuse \(50 \mathrm{~m}\) with \(5 \mathrm{~km}\) in percentage terms)
- B: \(95 \%\) (most will calculate it as \(1\%\) correctly)
- C: \(3 \%\) (some minor miscalculation or incorrect assumption)
- D: \(2 \%\) (very few might mistakenly calculate)

### advanced
Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts easily.
- A: \(0 \%\) (no chance of such a basic error)
- B: \(98 \%\) (almost all will get it right, with very minor chance of calculation error)
- C: \(1 \%\) (extremely rare miscalculation)
- D: \(1 \%\) (equally rare incorrect answer)

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
