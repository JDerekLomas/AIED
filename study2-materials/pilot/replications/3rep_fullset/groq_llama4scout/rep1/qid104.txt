To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The equation given is \((d-6)^{2}-16=0\). The correct next step to solve for \(d\) involves isolating \((d-6)^{2}\) and then taking the square root of both sides. The correct step provided is:
\((d-6)^{2}=16\)

Taking the square root of both sides gives:
\(d-6 = \pm4\)

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Solution
The correct next step after \((d-6)^{2}=16\) is indeed \(d-6 = \pm4\), which corresponds to option B.

## 2: Analyzing Potential Errors
- Option A: \(d^{2}=22\) is incorrect because it doesn't follow from the given equation in a straightforward manner related to the steps shown.
- Option C: \(d-6=4\) is incorrect because it only considers the positive square root, ignoring the \(\pm\).
- Option D: \(d-3=8\) seems unrelated to the direct solution steps of the given equation.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and square roots. They might be tempted by simple or incorrect manipulations. Option C (\(d-6=4\)) might appeal because it simplifies the equation but ignores the \(\pm\) aspect. Option A (\(d^{2}=22\)) could be a guess without clear algebraic basis. Option D (\(d-3=8\)) seems unrelated but might attract some due to confusion. Option B is the correct step but might not be chosen by many due to difficulty with \(\pm\).
  - below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%

- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic algebra and can handle simple equations. They are more likely to recognize the need for \(\pm\) but might still make errors due to carelessness or misunderstanding.
  - basic: A=15% B=60% C=20% D=5%

- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with algebraic manipulations, including solving quadratic equations in different forms. They should easily recognize the correct step.
  - proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of algebra and can apply it to complex problems. They should have no trouble with this question.
  - advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
