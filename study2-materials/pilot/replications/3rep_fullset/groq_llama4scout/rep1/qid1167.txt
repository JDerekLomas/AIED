To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential pitfalls for students at different ability levels.

The question requires converting meters to kilometers, using the conversion factor that \(1 \, \text{km} = 1000 \, \text{m}\). Therefore, \(4000 \, \text{m}\) is equal to \(4000 / 1000 = 4 \, \text{km}\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question is straightforward and tests a basic concept of unit conversion.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not understanding the conversion between meters and kilometers or misapplying it. For example, some students might mistakenly multiply or not convert correctly.

## 3: Analyzing Option Appeal
- Option A (\(400 \, \text{km}\)) suggests a misunderstanding where the student incorrectly applies the conversion or misinterprets the question.
- Option B (\(400000 \, \text{km}\)) implies a significant error, possibly from misplacing the decimal point or not understanding the conversion factor.
- Option C (\(4 \, \text{km}\)) is the correct answer.
- Option D (\(40 \, \text{km}\)) suggests another type of error where the student might think \(4000 \, \text{m} = 40 \, \text{km}\), possibly due to incorrect conversion.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level

### below_basic
At this level, students struggle with basic concepts. They might not fully understand unit conversions or might confuse the relationship between meters and kilometers.
- A: \(10\%\) (unlikely but could result from a miscalculation)
- B: \(20\%\) (significant error, possible due to confusion or miscalculation)
- C: \(60\%\) (still, a notable portion might get it right due to intuition or partial understanding)
- D: \(10\%\) (another type of error)

### basic
Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might make simple errors.
- A: \(5\%\)
- B: \(10\%\)
- C: \(80\%\) (most understand the basic conversion)
- D: \(5\%\)

### proficient
These students are more secure in their understanding of unit conversions.
- A: \(2\%\)
- B: \(2\%\)
- C: \(94\%\) (most get it right; the question is straightforward)
- D: \(2\%\)

### advanced
Advanced students are expected to have a deep and secure understanding.
- A: \(0\%\)
- B: \(0\%\)
- C: \(100\%\) (no errors expected)
- D: \(0\%\)

## 5: Refining Predictions
Given the simplicity of the conversion and assuming typical student performance:
- **below_basic**: A=\(5\%\) B=\(15\%\) C=\(70\%\) D=\(10\%\)
- **basic**: A=\(2\%\) B=\(5\%\) C=\(90\%\) D=\(3\%\)
- **proficient**: A=\(1\%\) B=\(1\%\) C=\(97\%\) D=\(1\%\)
- **advanced**: A=\(0\%\) B=\(0\%\) C=\(100\%\) D=\(0\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=5% B=15% C=70% D=10%
basic: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3%
proficient: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
