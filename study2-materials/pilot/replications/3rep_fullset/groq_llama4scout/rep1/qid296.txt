## Step 1: Understand the quadratic formula and its application
The quadratic formula to solve equations of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\). For the equation \(5h^2 - 3h - 2 = 0\), we have \(a = 5\), \(b = -3\), and \(c = -2\).

## 2: Apply the quadratic formula to the given equation
Substitute \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the quadratic formula: \(h = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot (-2)}}{2 \cdot 5}\). This simplifies to \(h = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 40}}{10}\), which further simplifies to \(h = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{10}\).

## 3: Identify the components of the quadratic formula in the given problem
The part under the square root in the quadratic formula is \(b^2 - 4ac\), and the denominator is \(2a\). For our equation, \(b^2 - 4ac = 9 + 40 = 49\) and \(2a = 10\). The expression given is \(\frac{?\pm \sqrt{9-(-40)}}{?}\), which simplifies to \(\frac{?\pm \sqrt{49}}{?}\).

## 4: Determine the correct values for the expression
Given \(\sqrt{9-(-40)} = \sqrt{49}\), the expression under the square root is indeed \(49\). The denominator in the quadratic formula is \(2a = 2 \cdot 5 = 10\). So, the correct expression should be \(\frac{?\pm \sqrt{49}}{10}\), implying that the \(?\) in the numerator should be \(3\) (since \(-b = -(-3) = 3\)) and the denominator is \(10\).

## 5: Evaluate the answer choices based on the correct formula application
The correct calculation for the part under the square root is \(49\), and this comes from \(9 - (-40) = 49\). The total under the square root is \(49\), which directly corresponds to option C. The numerator of the fraction should be \(3\) (not listed as an option but implied for context), and the denominator is \(10\), which was not directly asked but is crucial for understanding.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with applying the quadratic formula and could easily make mistakes in identifying \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), or in calculating \(b^2 - 4ac\). They might not recognize \(9 + 40 = 49\) or could confuse the operations. Expect a spread across incorrect options due to confusion.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of the formula but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are likely to recognize the \(49\) but might confuse the operations or the structure of the formula.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the quadratic formula well and are less likely to make arithmetic mistakes. They should easily identify \(49\) as the value under the square root.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the formula but are also adept at applying it quickly and accurately. They will quickly and correctly identify the value.

## 7: Assign percentages based on understanding and common misconceptions
Given the straightforward nature of calculating \(b^2 - 4ac = 49\) and the direct reference to this in the question, most students, even at lower levels, should be able to get this part right. The confusion might arise from not properly filling in the rest of the formula or misinterpreting the question.

## 8: Final percentage predictions
- **Below Basic**: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10% (guessing or miscalculation)
- **Basic**: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5% (more accurate but still some room for error)
- **Proficient**: A=2% B=5% C=90% D=3% (confident in their calculations)
- **Advanced**: A=1% B=2% C=95% D=2% (very confident and accurate)

The best answer is C. 

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
