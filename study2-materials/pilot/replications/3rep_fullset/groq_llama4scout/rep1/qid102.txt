To approach this question, let's analyze the compound shape made of two rectangles and understand what it's asking for. The shape consists of two rectangles, with sides labeled as \( p \) cm (in red), 15 cm, 12 cm, 7 cm, and 7 cm. One side is unlabelled.

## Step 1: Understanding the Shape
The shape can be seen as two rectangles joined together. One rectangle has sides of 7 cm and 15 cm, and the other has sides of 7 cm and 12 cm. However, to find \( p \), we need to consider how these rectangles are arranged.

## 2: Identifying the Relationship
Given that one side of each rectangle is 7 cm, and if we assume the 7 cm sides are the ones that join together (which is a reasonable assumption given the layout), then \( p \) would correspond to the side that completes the larger shape.

## 3: Calculating \( p \)
The total length of the side that includes \( p \) and 12 cm (from the second rectangle) must equal the 15 cm side of the first rectangle plus \( p \), but since \( p \) is opposite the 7 cm and 12 cm sides when considering the full shape, \( p \) actually matches the remaining side to complete the rectangle when combined with 12 cm to equal 15 cm + 7 cm is not the right approach. The correct approach is to see \( p \) as part of a rectangle where one dimension is 7 cm and the other is \( p \), and it combines with a 12 cm by 7 cm rectangle.

## 4: Solving for \( p \)
The correct insight is to realize the compound shape's sides give us \( p + 12 = 15 + 7 \) because the two longer sides must add up to the same total length as the other two longer sides when laid flat. This simplifies to \( p + 12 = 22 \), so \( p = 22 - 12 = 10 \) cm. However, this seems not to match any option directly, indicating a miscalculation in the thought process.

## 5: Reevaluating the Question
The mistake in calculation directs us back to basics: The actual calculation directly comes from understanding the figure might directly imply relationships without needing complex additions.

## 6: Realizing the Direct Calculation
Given the sides 15 cm and 7 cm on one rectangle and 12 cm and 7 cm on the adjacent one, \( p \) directly corresponds to making the shorter sides align or to complete a side. If one rectangle is 7 by 15 and the other 7 by 12, \( p \) could directly relate to completing a dimension.

## 7: Final Calculation
Considering the layout might suggest \( p = 5 \) cm if we consider it as making a side with 12 cm to reach a comparable length or directly inferred from the visual.

## 8: Error Prediction
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle to understand the geometry, potentially leading to D (Not enough information) being a popular choice. A=30% B=20% C=15% D=35%
- **Basic**: These students should grasp basic geometry, potentially leaning towards calculating \( p \) directly if they see a simple relationship. A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
- **Proficient**: Students here would likely solve it accurately, recognizing \( p + 12 = 15 + 7 \) does not apply but rather see \( p \) in relation to forming a coherent shape. A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
- **Advanced**: These students would quickly and accurately solve for \( p \) with minimal chance of error. A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%

The best answer is B.
