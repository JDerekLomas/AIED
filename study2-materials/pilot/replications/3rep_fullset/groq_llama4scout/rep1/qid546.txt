To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls or ease of solving it.

The question presents a simple frequency table and asks for the total number of matches played, which can be found by summing the frequencies of goals scored.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task requires summing the frequencies: \(6 + 7 + 4 + 3 + 1\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions or Traps
A common misconception could be misinterpreting the question or the table, but given the straightforward nature of the task (summing frequencies), the main challenge might be in simple arithmetic or ensuring one understands that the total number of matches is indeed the sum of all frequencies.

## 3: Calculating the Total
The calculation is: \(6 + 7 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 21\).

## 4: Analyzing Potential Errors
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic addition or misunderstand the concept of frequency. They might incorrectly add the numbers or choose an option that seems to reflect a misunderstanding of the task.
- **Basic:** Students here should be able to perform the addition but might be prone to errors in calculation or could potentially misread the table.
- **Proficient:** These students should easily and accurately sum the frequencies.
- **Advanced:** This group should not only accurately calculate but also quickly understand the question and its requirements.

## 5: Predicting Responses
- **Below Basic:** May struggle with arithmetic, potentially leading to choosing incorrect options (B, C, D) due to miscalculation. Let's assume 20% get it right (A=20%), with errors spread across B, C, and D, which seems a generous assumption given the simplicity of the task: B=20%, C=30%, D=30%.
- **Basic:** Should mostly get it right but with some errors: A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** Will likely get it right: A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%.
- **Advanced:** Will certainly get it right: A=99%, B=0.5%, C=0.5%, D=0%.

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic:** A=10% B=30% C=30% D=30%
- **Basic:** A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **Proficient:** A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
- **Advanced:** A=99% B=0.5% C=0.5% D=0%

The best answer is A. 

So, 
below_basic: A=10% B=30% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.5% D=0%
