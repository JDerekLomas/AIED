To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( \frac{1}{8} \) th of an hour \( = \_\_\_\_\_ \) minutes, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires converting \( \frac{1}{8} \) of an hour into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so \( \frac{1}{8} \) of an hour is \( \frac{1}{8} \times 60 = 7.5 \) minutes.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve incorrect conversion or misunderstanding fractions of an hour. For example, students might calculate \( \frac{1}{8} \) of 60 minutes incorrectly or confuse it with other fractions.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( 7.5 \) minutes. This is the correct answer.
- B: \( 8 \) minutes. This could be a result of rounding or a miscalculation.
- C: \( 0.8 \) minutes. This seems too low and might result from a significant miscalculation or incorrect conversion.
- D: \( 12.5 \) minutes. This could result from a miscalculation, such as thinking \( \frac{1}{8} \) of 100 (assuming 100 minutes in an hour) or another error.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic conversions and fraction understanding. They might choose C (\( 0.8 \)) due to a lack of understanding of fractions and time conversions, or B (\( 8 \)) due to a rough estimation. A (\( 7.5 \)) seems unlikely but not impossible if they've seen similar questions. D (\( 12.5 \)) could also be a guess. Prediction: A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple errors. They are likely to choose A (\( 7.5 \)) if they understand fractions and conversions correctly, but some might opt for B (\( 8 \)) due to slight miscalculations. C (\( 0.8 \)) and D (\( 12.5 \)) seem less likely. Prediction: A=60%, B=30%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of fractions and conversions. They are most likely to choose A (\( 7.5 \)) correctly. B (\( 8 \)) or D (\( 12.5 \)) might be chosen by a few due to minor miscalculations, but C (\( 0.8 \)) seems highly unlikely. Prediction: A=90%, B=5%, C=0%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and are less likely to make errors in basic calculations. They will likely choose A (\( 7.5 \)) correctly. Prediction: A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=30% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
