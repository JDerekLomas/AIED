To tackle this question, let's analyze the equation \(y = 4 - 2x\) and what it implies for its graph.

1. **Y-intercept**: When \(x = 0\), \(y = 4 - 2(0) = 4\). This means the graph crosses the y-axis at \(y = 4\), which is above the origin.

2. **X-intercept**: When \(y = 0\), \(0 = 4 - 2x\), which rearranges to \(2x = 4\), so \(x = 2\). This means the graph crosses the x-axis at \(x = 2\), which is to the right of the origin.

3. **Gradient**: The coefficient of \(x\) is \(-2\), which is negative. This indicates that the line slopes downward from left to right.

Given these characteristics:
- The graph must cross the y-axis above the origin.
- The graph must cross the x-axis to the right of the origin.
- The line has a negative gradient.

Let's evaluate the options:
- **A**: Crosses the x-axis to the right of the origin and the y-axis above the origin. This matches our analysis.
- **B**: Crosses the x-axis to the left of the origin and the y-axis below the origin. This does not match.
- **C**: Crosses the x-axis to the left of the origin and the y-axis above the origin. This does not match because it crosses the x-axis to the left.
- **D**: Crosses the x-axis to the right of the origin and the y-axis below the origin. This does not match because it crosses the y-axis below the origin.

## Predicted Student Responses

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the equation of a line and its graph. They might not accurately recall how to find intercepts or understand the implications of the gradient. 
  - A=40% (some might get it by chance or rough estimation)
  - B=30% (misunderstanding of intercepts and gradient)
  - C=20% (similar misunderstanding)
  - D=10% (least likely due to incorrect positioning on both axes)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors in applying concepts, especially under time pressure or with complex graphs.
  - A=60% (most should understand the basics of intercepts)
  - B=20% (some might confuse the intercepts)
  - C=10% (less likely due to clear mismatch)
  - D=10% (clear mismatch)

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of linear equations and graphing. They should accurately identify the correct graph based on intercepts and gradient.
  - A=80% (confident in identifying correct graph)
  - B=10% (occasional mistake)
  - C=5% (rare mistake)
  - D=5% (rare mistake)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them with ease and precision. They are less likely to make errors.
  - A=90% (high confidence in correct answer)
  - B=5% (very rare mistake)
  - C=2% (very rare mistake)
  - D=3% (very rare mistake)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
