To approach this question, let's consider the concepts involved and how they might be understood by students at different ability levels.

## Step 1: Understanding the Concept of a Midpoint
The midpoint \( M \) between two points \( P \) and \( Q \) is the point that divides the line segment \( PQ \) into two equal parts. This means that \( M \) is equidistant from \( P \) and \( Q \), or in formula terms, \( M = \left( \frac{x_P + x_Q}{2}, \frac{y_P + y_Q}{2} \right) \) for coordinates \( (x_P, y_P) \) and \( (x_Q, y_Q) \).

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Statement
Tom claims that if you know the location of \( M \) only, then there is more than one possible location for \( P \) and \( Q \). This can be visualized as \( P \) and \( Q \) being on a line that passes through \( M \), but on opposite sides of \( M \). For any given \( M \), \( P \) and \( Q \) can be anywhere on the line that passes through \( M \), as long as \( M \) is the midpoint of \( PQ \). This implies multiple possible locations for \( P \) and \( Q \) given only \( M \), making Tom's statement correct.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Statement
Katie says that if you only know the locations of \( M \) and \( Q \), then there is more than one possible location for \( P \). However, if \( M \) is the midpoint of \( PQ \), and you know \( M \) and \( Q \), then \( P \) must be on the opposite side of \( M \) from \( Q \) and at the same distance from \( M \) as \( Q \) is. This uniquely determines \( P \) because \( P = 2M - Q \). Thus, knowing \( M \) and \( Q \) does not allow for more than one possible location for \( P \), making Katie's statement incorrect.

## 4: Evaluating Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of a midpoint and its implications. They might not fully grasp that knowing \( M \) allows for multiple \( P \) and \( Q \) configurations but could mistakenly think that adding \( Q \) gives multiple \( P \)s. So, they might choose \( D \) (neither is correct) or \( C \) (both Tom and Katie) due to misunderstanding. \( A = 30\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 40\% \).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of midpoints. They might see that Tom is correct because \( M \) can have many \( P \) and \( Q \) pairs, but might be confused about Katie's statement, potentially thinking it could be true due to lack of deep understanding. So, \( A = 50\% \), \( B = 15\% \), \( C = 15\% \), \( D = 20\% \).
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand that \( M \) having multiple \( P \) and \( Q \) pairs is true, and that knowing \( M \) and \( Q \) uniquely determines \( P \). They should correctly identify Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect. So, \( A = 70\% \), \( B = 10\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 15\% \).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the geometric and algebraic implications but can also reason about the statements logically. They will easily see Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrectness. So, \( A = 85\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 5\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
