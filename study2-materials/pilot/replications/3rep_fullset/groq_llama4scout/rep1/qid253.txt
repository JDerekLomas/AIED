## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents three angles that meet to form a straight line, labeled as 46 degrees, 115 degrees, and \( k \) degrees. The task is to find the size of angle \( k \).

## 2: Identifying the Relevant Concept
The key concept here is that the sum of the angles forming a straight line is 180 degrees.

## 3: Analyzing the Misconception
A common misconception could be that students might not correctly apply the rule that angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees or might confuse the process of solving for \( k \).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- For students who are below_basic, there's a higher chance of misunderstanding the basic concept of angles on a straight line or making calculation errors. They might incorrectly add or subtract the given angles or choose an option without calculation.
- Basic level students should understand the concept but might struggle with the calculation or be tempted by incorrect options.
- Proficient students should easily solve for \( k \) using the equation \( 46 + 115 + k = 180 \).
- Advanced students should not only solve it correctly but also do so efficiently.

## 5: Calculating Angle \( k \)
To find \( k \), we use \( 46 + 115 + k = 180 \). Simplifying, \( 161 + k = 180 \), which gives \( k = 180 - 161 = 19 \) degrees.

## 6: Predicting Percentages for Each Option
- **Below Basic**: These students might not understand the concept properly. Option A (46 degrees) might seem plausible to some as it's one of the given angles, B (65 degrees) could be a miscalculation, C (19 degrees) is the correct answer but might not be chosen by many due to calculation difficulties, and D (Not enough information) might be chosen by those who don't understand the concept. So, A=30%, B=20%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students here should have a better grasp but might make simple calculation errors. C seems likely for most, but some might choose A or B due to mistakes. D is less likely. So, A=10%, B=15%, C=70%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily identify \( k = 19 \) degrees. So, A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: For these students, the question is straightforward. So, A=2%, B=2%, C=90%, D=6%.

## 7: Finalizing Predictions
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation and the concept:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
