## Step 1: Analyze the sequence pattern
The sequence provided shows a pattern where each term consists of a certain number of rectangles surrounded by circles. In Pattern 1, there is 1 rectangle with 6 circles. In Pattern 2, there are 2 rectangles with 10 circles. In Pattern 3, there are 3 rectangles with 14 circles. We need to identify the pattern to predict the number of circles in the 7th term.

## 2: Identify the pattern
Looking at the pattern:
- Pattern 1: 1 rectangle, 6 circles
- Pattern 2: 2 rectangles, 10 circles
- Pattern 3: 3 rectangles, 14 circles
The number of circles increases by 4 each time (10 - 6 = 4, 14 - 10 = 4). The number of rectangles increases by 1 each time.

## 3: Determine the formula for the number of circles
If we consider the number of circles in each term:
- Term 1: 6 circles
- Term 2: 10 circles
- Term 3: 14 circles
It seems the number of circles starts at 6 and increases by 4 for each subsequent term. Thus, for the nth term, the number of circles could be represented as \(6 + (n-1) \times 4\).

## 4: Calculate the number of circles in the 7th term
Using the formula \(6 + (n-1) \times 4\), for the 7th term:
\[6 + (7-1) \times 4 = 6 + 6 \times 4 = 6 + 24 = 30\]

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand the pattern or how to apply a formula. They might guess or incorrectly calculate. Option A (42) could be a guess if they mistakenly apply a different pattern. Option B (26) might be considered if they undercount. Option C (34) could be chosen if they add incorrectly. Option D (30) is the correct answer.

- **Basic**: Students here might recognize the pattern of adding 4 circles but could make calculation errors. They are more likely to choose D (30) if they understand the sequence but might be tempted by A or C if they miscalculate.

- **Proficient**: These students should easily recognize the pattern and calculate correctly, choosing D (30).

- **Advanced**: Students at this level will not only correctly identify the pattern but also might derive a general formula for the nth term and apply it correctly, choosing D (30).

## 6: Assign percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the pattern and the question, most students should be able to get it right, especially if they've seen similar sequences before.

- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=15% C=20% D=45%
- **Basic**: A=10% B=10% C=15% D=65%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The best answer is D.
