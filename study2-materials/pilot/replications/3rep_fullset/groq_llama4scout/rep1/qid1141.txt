To predict how students at different ability levels would answer this question, let's first understand the concept being tested and the common misconceptions.

The question asks to convert \(0.5\%\) into a fraction. To do this, we need to remember that \(\%\) means "out of 100," so \(0.5\% = 0.5 \times \frac{1}{100} = \frac{0.5}{100} = \frac{5}{1000} = \frac{1}{200}\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Common Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the conversion process or misinterpreting the percentage sign. For instance, some might incorrectly think \(0.5\% = 0.5 = \frac{1}{2}\) because they ignore the percentage sign.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(\frac{1}{2}\) is incorrect because it doesn't account for the percentage conversion correctly.
- Option B: \(\frac{1}{20}\) is incorrect because \(0.5\% = \frac{0.5}{100} = \frac{1}{200}\), not \(\frac{1}{20}\).
- Option C: \(\frac{1}{200}\) is correct because \(0.5\% = 0.5 \times \frac{1}{100} = \frac{0.5}{100} = \frac{1}{200}\).
- Option D: \(\frac{1}{2000}\) is incorrect because it's \(\frac{0.5}{1000} = \frac{1}{2000}\) if you mistakenly convert \(0.5\) directly without considering the percentage, but actually, it represents \(0.05\%\), not \(0.5\%\).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic conversions and have a high chance of making errors. They might confuse \(0.5\%\) with \(0.5\) and choose A (\(\frac{1}{2}\)), or not understand percentages well and choose randomly. So, A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with nuanced concepts like converting decimals to percentages and then to fractions. They are likely to choose C (\(\frac{1}{200}\)) but with some errors, possibly towards A. So, A=20%, B=10%, C=60%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level understand percentages and fraction conversions well. They are likely to get it right, choosing C. So, A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the concepts but are also adept at applying them. They would easily convert \(0.5\%\) to \(\frac{1}{200}\). So, A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
