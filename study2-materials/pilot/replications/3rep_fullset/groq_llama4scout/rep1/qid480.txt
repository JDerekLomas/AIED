To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question "What number is \( 100 \) more than \( 72980 ? \)", let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question seems straightforward, asking for a simple addition of 100 to 72980. The correct answer is \( 72980 + 100 = 73080 \).

## Step 1: Identify the Correct Answer
The correct calculation is \( 72980 + 100 = 73080 \), which corresponds to option A.

## 2: Analyze Potential Misconceptions and Errors
- A common misconception could involve misplacing or misinterpreting the digits, especially when adding a small number like 100.
- Another error could be misunderstanding the operation or the place value.

## 3: Evaluate Each Option
- Option A: \( 73,080 \) - Correct answer.
- Option B: \( 73,980 \) - Incorrect; this would be the result of adding 1000, not 100.
- Option C: \( 7,298,000 \) - Incorrect; this seems to involve a misunderstanding of place value or the operation.
- Option D: \( 72,080 \) - Incorrect; this would be a subtraction of 1700, not an addition.

## 4: Consider Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations or understanding place value. They might incorrectly choose options due to a lack of understanding of addition or place value.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to understand basic arithmetic operations accurately but might still make occasional errors under pressure or with tricky questions.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of arithmetic and be less likely to make simple errors.

## 5: Predict Student Choices
Given the simplicity of the question and the nature of the options:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some understand basic addition), B=30% (misunderstanding of addition), C=15% (misconception of scale), D=15% (subtraction error).
- **Basic**: A=70% (understand basic addition), B=20% (common mistake), C=5% (unlikely), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Proficient**: A=90% (strong understanding), B=5% (occasional mistake), C=2% (unlikely), D=3% (unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (very strong understanding), B=3% (rare mistake), C=1% (very unlikely), D=1% (very unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
