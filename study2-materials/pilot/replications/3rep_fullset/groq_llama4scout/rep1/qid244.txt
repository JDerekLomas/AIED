To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls it presents.

The question involves calculating the total cost for Heena's visit to a theme park. The cost consists of a fixed entry fee of \( £ 8 \) and a variable cost of \( £ 3 \) per ride. Heena goes on \( 5 \) rides.

## Step 1: Calculate the total cost
First, let's calculate the total cost to understand the correct answer. The entry fee is \( £ 8 \), and Heena goes on \( 5 \) rides at \( £ 3 \) each, so the cost for the rides is \( 5 \times £ 3 = £ 15 \). Adding the entry fee, the total cost is \( £ 8 + £ 15 = £ 23 \).

## 2: Identify potential misconceptions and errors
- A common misconception might involve misunderstanding the question or miscalculating the costs.
- Option B (\( £ 15 \)) might appeal to students who only consider the cost of the rides.
- Option C (\( £ 11 \)) could be a result of incorrect calculations or omitting parts of the costs.
- Option A (\( £ 55 \)) seems too high and might result from overestimation or incorrect multiplication.

## 3: Analyze the question's difficulty and potential student responses
Given that the question directly states all necessary information and the calculation is straightforward (\( £ 8 \) entry fee + \( £ 3 \times 5 \) rides), most students, even at the basic level, should be able to compute the total correctly as \( £ 23 \), assuming they understand basic arithmetic operations.

## 4: Predict student responses by ability level
- **below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic or understanding the question. They might choose B (\( £ 15 \)) if they only consider the ride costs (30% B), C (\( £ 11 \)) if they misunderstand or miscalculate (20% C), A (\( £ 55 \)) if they overestimate (20% A), or D (\( £ 23 \)) if they somehow manage to calculate correctly (30% D).
- **basic**: Students here should have a good grasp of basic arithmetic. They might still make simple errors, so B (\( £ 15 \)) could be chosen by 10% if they forget the entry fee, C (\( £ 11 \)) by 5% for similar reasons, A (\( £ 55 \)) by 5% for overestimation, and D (\( £ 23 \)) by 80% if they calculate correctly.
- **proficient**: These students should accurately calculate the total cost most of the time. So, D (\( £ 23 \)) should be chosen by 95%, with minimal errors leading to other options (A=2%, B=2%, C=1%).
- **advanced**: Students at this level should easily and accurately compute the total. Hence, D (\( £ 23 \)) should be chosen by 99%, with virtually no errors (A=0.5%, B=0.5%, C=0%).

## 5: Provide the predictions in the required format
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
- **proficient**: A=2% B=2% C=1% D=95%
- **advanced**: A=0.5% B=0.5% C=0% D=99%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=1% D=95%
advanced: A=0.5% B=0.5% C=0% D=99%
