To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with solving equations.

The equation given is \(\frac{m}{4} - 1 = 20\). The task is to evaluate the first steps suggested by Tom and Katie to solve this equation.

## Step 1: Understanding Tom's suggestion
Tom suggests writing \(\frac{m}{4} = 21\). To verify if this is a valid first step, we add 1 to both sides of the original equation:
\(\frac{m}{4} - 1 + 1 = 20 + 1\), which simplifies to \(\frac{m}{4} = 21\). Therefore, Tom's suggestion is correct.

## 2: Understanding Katie's suggestion
Katie suggests writing \(m - 1 = 80\). To verify if this is a valid first step, we multiply every term in the original equation by 4 to clear the denominator:
\(4 \times \frac{m}{4} - 4 \times 1 = 4 \times 20\), which simplifies to \(m - 4 = 80\). Katie's suggestion is \(m - 1 = 80\), which does not match the correct manipulation of the original equation. Therefore, Katie's suggestion is incorrect.

## 3: Analyzing the misconceptions and student responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not fully understand how to isolate variables or perform operations on equations. Given the simplicity of the correct operation (adding 1 to both sides), a significant portion might recognize Tom's step as correct but could be confused by Katie's. However, the lack of understanding might lead to a higher percentage choosing incorrect options due to not fully grasping the concepts.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding of algebra. They should be able to see that adding 1 to both sides is a valid step (supporting Tom) but might struggle with recognizing the error in Katie's step or might not be confident in their abilities, potentially leading to a spread across options.

- **Proficient**: Students at this level are expected to have a solid grasp of algebraic manipulations. They should easily recognize Tom's step as correct and Katie's as incorrect, given the straightforward nature of the manipulations involved.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand algebraic manipulations but can also analyze and solve more complex equations. They should have no trouble identifying Tom's suggestion as correct and Katie's as incorrect.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
Given the question's nature, let's predict the responses:
- **Below Basic**: A=70% (recognize Tom's correct step), B=15% (incorrectly think Katie is right), C=5% (think both are correct), D=10% (think neither is correct).
- **Basic**: A=80% (recognize Tom), B=10% (Katie), C=5% (both), D=5% (neither).
- **Proficient**: A=90% (Tom), B=5% (Katie), C=3% (both), D=2% (neither).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (Tom), B=2% (Katie), C=2% (both), D=1% (neither).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=70% B=15% C=5% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
