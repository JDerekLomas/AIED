To approach this question, let's analyze the strategies proposed by Tom and Katie and evaluate their correctness.

Tom suggests adding \( 9 \) by adding \( 10 \) and then subtracting \( 1 \). This can be represented as \( x + 9 = (x + 10) - 1 \), which is mathematically correct.

Katie suggests subtracting \( 9 \) by subtracting \( 10 \) and then adding \( 1 \) (not subtracting \( 1 \) as the option might confusingly suggest). The correct strategy she might intend is \( x - 9 = (x - 10) + 1 \), which is also mathematically correct.

However, Katie's statement as given is "a good way to subtract \( 9 \) is to subtract \( 10 \) and then subtract \( 1 \)", which translates to \( x - 9 = (x - 10) - 1 = x - 11 \). This is incorrect.

Given this analysis:

- Tom's strategy is correct.
- Katie's strategy, as stated, is incorrect.

Now, let's consider how students at different ability levels might respond:

## Step 1: Understanding the Strategies
Students need to understand and evaluate two mental math strategies. The correctness of Tom's strategy is straightforward. Katie's strategy, as presented, seems to be a common misconception but is directly stated.

## 2: Evaluating Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand or evaluate the strategies. They might not recognize the correctness of Tom's method and could misunderstand Katie's method entirely. Given the straightforward nature of Tom's correct strategy and the obvious error in Katie's as stated, a significant portion might choose C (Both Tom and Katie) due to not fully grasping the implications of Katie's strategy.

## 3: Basic Level Students
Basic level students might understand Tom's strategy but could be confused by Katie's. They might see the logic in Tom's approach but not critically evaluate Katie's. A notable percentage might still choose C due to a lack of critical thinking.

## 4: Proficient Students
Proficient students are likely to understand both strategies and see that Tom's is correct and Katie's, as stated, leads to an incorrect result. They should be able to critically evaluate both statements.

## 5: Advanced Students
Advanced students will easily see the correctness of Tom's strategy and the error in Katie's. They are less likely to be misled by common misconceptions.

## 6: Predicting Responses
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (understanding Tom but not Katie's error), B=10% (only Katie, not recognizing Tom's correctness), C=60% (not fully understanding either), D=10% (recognizing both are incorrect or not applicable).
- **Basic**: A=40%, B=10%, C=40%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=60%, B=5%, C=30%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=80%, B=0%, C=15%, D=5%.

The best answer is C. 

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=60% B=5% C=30% D=5%
advanced: A=80% B=0% C=15% D=5%
