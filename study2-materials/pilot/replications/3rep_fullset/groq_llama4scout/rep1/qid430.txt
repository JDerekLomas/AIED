To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about the gradient of the line \(4x - 5y = 20\), let's first rearrange the equation into the slope-intercept form, \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the gradient.

Rearranging the given equation:
\[4x - 5y = 20\]
\[-5y = -4x + 20\]
\[y = \frac{4}{5}x - 4\]

So, the gradient (\(m\)) of the line is \(\frac{4}{5}\).

Now, let's analyze the options and predict the performance of students at different ability levels:

- **Option A: \(4\)** - This would be a incorrect response if students mistakenly take the coefficient of \(x\) as the gradient without rearranging the equation or misunderstand the process of finding the gradient.
- **Option B: \(\frac{4}{5}\)** - This is the correct gradient.
- **Option C: \(-\frac{4}{5}\)** - This might be chosen if students incorrectly apply a negative sign or misinterpret the signs in the equation.
- **Option D: \(-4\)** - This seems unlikely as it suggests a different form of the equation altogether.

### Ability Levels and Predicted Responses

#### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with rearranging equations and understanding what a gradient represents. They might not fully grasp the algebraic manipulation needed.
- A=30% (misinterpreting the coefficient of \(x\))
- B=20% (some might get it right through guesswork or partial understanding)
- C=20% (applying incorrect operations with negatives)
- D=30% (completely off or misinterpreting the equation)

#### basic
Students here have a foundational understanding but may struggle with algebraic manipulations or might make careless mistakes.
- A=15% (still some confusion with coefficients)
- B=60% (understand the concept but might make small mistakes in calculation)
- C=10% (minor errors with signs)
- D=15% (more complex misunderstandings)

#### proficient
These students have a solid grasp of algebra and can rearrange equations. They are less likely to make simple mistakes.
- A=5% (rarely mistaken, but possible under time pressure)
- B=80% (clear understanding and correct application)
- C=5% (unlikely, but possible for those who double-check and make a sign error)
- D=10% (more likely to recognize incorrect options)

#### advanced
Students at this level are highly confident and accurate in their algebraic manipulations and understanding of mathematical concepts.
- A=0% (well aware of correct procedures)
- B=90% (high accuracy)
- C=0% (understand sign implications)
- D=10% (maybe exploring alternative incorrect paths for educational purposes)

Given these analyses:
