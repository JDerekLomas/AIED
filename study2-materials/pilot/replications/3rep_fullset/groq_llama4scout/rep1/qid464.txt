To solve this, let's first analyze the question and the potential pitfalls for students at different ability levels.

The question asks students to compare the fraction of the rectangle that is shaded in each diagram to decide which one is the odd one out. The fractions given are:
- A: 1/3
- B: 2/6
- C: 3/9
- D: 6/12

All these fractions are equivalent (they all simplify to 1/3), meaning that visually, all the rectangles have the same proportion shaded. The task is to identify which one does not belong based on the shading, but given the fractions are all equal, it might seem like there isn't an odd one out based on proportion. However, students might be tricked by the visual or by simplifying the fractions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Fractions
Each fraction can be simplified as follows:
- A: 1/3 (already simplified)
- B: 2/6 simplifies to 1/3
- C: 3/9 simplifies to 1/3
- D: 6/12 simplifies to 1/2

## 2: Identifying the Odd One Out
The odd one out is D: 6/12 because it simplifies to 1/2, not 1/3 like the others.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with fraction simplification and comparison. They might not simplify the fractions correctly or might not understand the concept of equivalent fractions. Given the visual nature of the question, they might pick an answer based on visual cues rather than calculations. Expect a high level of incorrect responses. 
  - A: 40% (visual cue, seems simple)
  - B: 30% (might see it as a possible candidate due to the fraction)
  - C: 20% (less likely, as it seems similar to A and B)
  - D: 10% (might not stand out as different without calculation)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of fractions and might be able to simplify some of them. However, they might still struggle with comparing them or might make calculation errors.
  - A: 20% (seems straightforward)
  - B: 15% (recognize it's equivalent to A)
  - C: 15% (similar to A and B)
  - D: 50% (stands out upon correct simplification)

- **Proficient:** Students at this level should be able to simplify fractions easily and compare them. They are likely to identify D as the odd one out quickly.
  - A: 5% (unlikely to choose if they understand fractions)
  - B: 5% (similarly unlikely)
  - C: 5% (unlikely)
  - D: 85% (correct identification)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand fractions but are also quick in calculations and comparisons. They would easily identify D as the odd one out.
  - A: 0% (very unlikely)
  - B: 0% 
  - C: 0%
  - D: 100% (correct and confident)

## 4: Providing the Answer
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
- basic: A=20% B=15% C=15% D=50%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=15% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
