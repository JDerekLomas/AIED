To approach this question, let's analyze the steps given and the common misconceptions or errors students might make when solving linear equations.

The equation given is \(4p + 5 = 2p - 9\). Let's solve it step by step to identify any incorrect steps:

1. Subtract \(2p\) from both sides: \(4p - 2p + 5 = 2p - 2p - 9\), which simplifies to \(2p + 5 = -9\).
2. Subtract 5 from both sides: \(2p + 5 - 5 = -9 - 5\), which simplifies to \(2p = -14\).
3. Divide both sides by 2: \(2p / 2 = -14 / 2\), which simplifies to \(p = -7\).

Now, let's compare these steps with the ones provided:
- The original equation is \(4p + 5 = 2p - 9\).
- Step A: \(4p = 2p - 4\). To get to this step from the original equation, one would subtract 5 from both sides: \(4p + 5 - 5 = 2p - 9 - 5\), resulting in \(4p = 2p - 14\), not \(4p = 2p - 4\). So, Step A is incorrect based on the calculation error.
- Step B: \(2p = -4\). Following from a correct manipulation from Step A, if we had \(4p = 2p - 14\), subtracting \(2p\) from both sides gives \(2p = -14\), not \(2p = -4\). So, Step B seems to be based on an incorrect previous step.
- Step C: \(p = -2\). If \(2p = -4\), then \(p = -2\), which would be correct if Step B were correct.

Given this analysis, the incorrect step is clearly A, as it misrepresents the equation.

Now, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not even attempt to solve it or might make significant errors.
  - A: 60% (They might identify it as wrong but not know why or how to correct it properly)
  - B: 10% (Might think it's correct or not notice the error)
  - C: 5% (Less likely to choose this as they might not proceed that far)
  - D: 25% (Might think all steps are correct due to lack of understanding)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding but might make simple errors.
  - A: 80% (They are likely to spot the error in Step A)
  - B: 5% (Might mistakenly think B or C is incorrect but not A)
  - C: 5% (Could mistakenly identify C)
  - D: 10% (Might overlook the error)

- **Proficient**: Students at this level are more likely to solve equations correctly but might still make occasional mistakes.
  - A: 90% (Easily spot the mistake in Step A)
  - B: 5% (Unlikely to choose B as incorrect given they see A is wrong)
  - C: 0% (Unlikely to choose C as incorrect)
  - D: 5% (Very few would think all are correct)

- **Advanced**: These students are highly likely to solve the equation correctly and understand the process.
  - A: 95% (Certainly spot the error)
  - B: 0% (Not likely to choose B)
  - C: 0% (Not likely to choose C)
  - D: 5% (Extremely few would have any doubt)

Based on the analysis:

below_basic: A=60% B=10% C=5% D=25%
basic: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
