To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question asks for the vector notation of "Three left and five down," which translates to \( \left(\begin{array}{c}-3 \\ -5\end{array}\right) \). Therefore, the correct answer for \( \triangle \) is \( -3 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception in vector notation, especially with direction, is that students might confuse the signs or the components. Moving "left" corresponds to a negative change in the x-direction, and moving "down" corresponds to a negative change in the y-direction.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 3 \) suggests moving right (positive x-direction), which is incorrect for "three left."
- Option B: \( -3 \) correctly represents moving three units left.
- Option C: \( 5 \) suggests moving up (positive y-direction), which is incorrect for "five down."
- Option D: \( -5 \) correctly represents moving five units down but is not the answer for \( \triangle \).

## 3: Considering Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic vector concepts and are more likely to make simple errors, such as not understanding that "left" means negative or confusing the components. They might choose A or C because they don't fully grasp the direction notation.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still be prone to errors, especially if they misinterpret "left and down" as simply positive or negative without applying it correctly to the vector components. They might lean towards B but could also choose A or D if confused.
- **Proficient:** These students understand vector notation well and are less likely to choose A or C. They should predominantly choose B.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the vector notation but also apply it accurately. They should have no trouble choosing B.

## 4: Estimating Percentages
Given the question's straightforward nature but potential for confusion:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (confusing left with right), B=30% (correct but requires understanding), C=20% (confusing down with up), D=10% (incorrect component).
- **Basic:** A=20%, B=60%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** A=1%, B=98%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%
