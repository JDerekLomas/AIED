To solve this, let's first analyze the equation and the steps proposed by Jo and Paul, and then consider the potential misconceptions and understanding required at different ability levels.

The given equation is \(\frac{m}{6} - 4 = 24\).

## Step 1: Solve the equation to verify Jo and Paul's steps.
To verify who is correct, let's solve the equation properly:
\(\frac{m}{6} - 4 = 24\)
Adding 4 to both sides gives:
\(\frac{m}{6} = 28\)
This matches Jo's suggestion.

## 2: Evaluate Jo's suggestion.
Jo says \(\frac{m}{6} = 28\). Let's see if this is correct:
If \(\frac{m}{6} = 28\), then \(m = 28 \times 6 = 168\).
Substituting \(m = 168\) back into the original equation:
\(\frac{168}{6} - 4 = 28 - 4 = 24\), which is correct.

## 3: Evaluate Paul's suggestion.
Paul says \(m - 4 = 144\). Let's evaluate this:
If \(m - 4 = 144\), then \(m = 148\).
Substituting \(m = 148\) back into the original equation:
\(\frac{148}{6} - 4 = 24.67 - 4 = 20.67\), which does not equal 24.

## 4: Analyze potential student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and could easily be confused by the suggestions. They might not fully understand the equation or how to isolate \(m\). Given the straightforward nature of Jo's correction and the obvious incorrectness of Paul's (without calculation), we might expect:
  - A high percentage to incorrectly choose Paul or think both are correct due to not fully understanding the algebraic steps.

- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding of algebra but might still make simple mistakes. They should be able to follow Jo's logic easily but might be tricked by Paul's if they don't fully understand the equation:
  - A significant percentage might choose A (Only Jo) correctly.
  - Some might still choose D (Neither is correct) or B (Only Paul) if they don't fully grasp the algebraic manipulations.

- **Proficient:** Students here have a good grasp of algebra and should easily see that Jo's step is correct and Paul's is not:
  - Most should choose A (Only Jo).

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the algebra but can also quickly assess the validity of the proposed steps:
  - Virtually all should choose A (Only Jo).

## 5: Predict Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (some understand Jo's simple addition), B=30% (think Paul's could be right), C=10% (not likely to see both as correct), D=20% (don't understand either).
- **Basic:** A=60% (understand Jo), B=20% (some still confused by Paul), C=5% (very few see both as correct), D=15% (a few don't get either).
- **Proficient:** A=80% (clearly see Jo's correctness), B=10% (some lingering confusion), C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
