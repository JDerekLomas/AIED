To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the expression given and common misconceptions related to factorization, especially for students at different ability levels.

The expression \( p^{2} - 100 \) is a difference of squares, which can be factorized into \( (p - 10)(p + 10) \). This is a straightforward application of the formula \( a^{2} - b^{2} = (a - b)(a + b) \), where in this case \( a = p \) and \( b = 10 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not recognizing the difference of squares or incorrectly applying factorization rules. For example, students might try to factor it like a quadratic equation or incorrectly apply the formula.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \( p(p - 10) \), suggests a factorization that would be incorrect for \( p^{2} - 100 \) because it doesn't account for the \( -100 \) properly in a factorized form related to \( p^{2} \).

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \( (p - 10)(p - 10) \), implies \( p^{2} - 20p + 100 \), which does not match \( p^{2} - 100 \).

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \( (p - 10)(p + 10) \), is the correct factorization of \( p^{2} - 100 \) using the difference of squares formula.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D, "Does not factorise," would be incorrect because \( p^{2} - 100 \) can indeed be factorized using real numbers.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with recognizing the difference of squares or might not know how to factorize expressions properly. They might choose Option A or B due to a lack of understanding or choose D thinking it can't be factorized. Option C: 20%, A: 30%, B: 30%, D: 20%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding and might recognize the difference of squares but could still make errors. They are more likely to choose C but might also consider A or B. Option C: 60%, A: 20%, B: 15%, D: 5%.
- **Proficient:** These students are familiar with the factorization techniques, including the difference of squares. They are likely to choose Option C correctly. Option C: 90%, A: 5%, B: 3%, D: 2%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident in their algebraic manipulations and would quickly identify the correct factorization. Option C: 98%, A: 1%, B: 1%, D: 0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=3% C=90% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=98% D=0%
