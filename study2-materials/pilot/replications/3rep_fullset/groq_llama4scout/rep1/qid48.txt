To solve this, let's work backwards from the output \(9a - 21\) to find the input.

## Step 1: Understand the operations performed by the function machine
The function machine performs two operations in sequence: 
1. It subtracts 3 from the input (denoted as \(\Rightarrow -3\)).
2. It then multiplies the result by 3 (denoted as \(\Rightarrow \times 3\)).

## 2: Represent the input
Let's denote the input as \(x\).

## 3: Apply the operations in reverse to find the input
Given the output is \(9a - 21\), and the last operation was multiplication by 3, we first divide the output by 3 to reverse this operation:
\(\frac{9a - 21}{3} = 3a - 7\).

## 4: Reverse the subtraction of 3
Before the multiplication by 3, the operation was subtraction of 3. So, to reverse the subtraction of 3, we add 3 to \(3a - 7\):
\(3a - 7 + 3 = 3a - 4\).

## 5: Identify the correct answer
From the calculations, the input to the function machine is \(3a - 4\).

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and understanding the sequence of operations. They might incorrectly apply operations or forget steps. Option B (\(3a - 4\)) is the correct answer, but these students might choose any option randomly or based on common misconceptions. Let's assume A=20%, B=40%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They should be able to follow the steps but might get confused. The correct answer B (\(3a - 4\)) seems plausible for many, but some might choose C (\(3a - 21\)) because it directly relates to the output. Let's assume A=10%, B=60%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebra well and can apply operations correctly. They should easily find the input. Let's assume A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand algebra but can also manipulate expressions efficiently. They would quickly and accurately find the input. Let's assume A=0%, B=90%, C=5%, D=5%.

## 7: Provide the predictions in the required format
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
