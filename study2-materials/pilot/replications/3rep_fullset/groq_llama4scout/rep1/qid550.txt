To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie regarding the order of operations, which is a fundamental concept in mathematics often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction).

## Step 1: Evaluate Tom's Statement
Tom says: \( 3+2-1 \equiv 3-1+2 \). Let's calculate both sides to verify if Tom is correct.
- Left side: \( 3 + 2 - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4 \)
- Right side: \( 3 - 1 + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4 \)
Tom's statement is correct because both sides equal 4.

## 2: Evaluate Katie's Statement
Katie says: \( 3+2 \times 1 \equiv 2 \times 1+3 \). Let's calculate both sides.
- Left side: Following the order of operations (BIDMAS), we do multiplication before addition: \( 3 + 2 \times 1 = 3 + 2 = 5 \)
- Right side: \( 2 \times 1 + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 \)
Katie's statement is also correct because both sides equal 5.

## 3: Consider the Implications for Student Responses
Given that both Tom and Katie are correct, the correct answer is C) Both Tom and Katie. 

## 4: Predict Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the order of operations. They might not correctly evaluate the expressions or might misunderstand the concept entirely. However, since both statements are actually correct and the calculations are straightforward, even students who are not strong in maths might get this right if they follow the operations correctly. But, they might be more prone to errors, so let's assume a higher chance of incorrect responses: A=20% B=20% D=30% C=30%
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of maths operations. They are more likely to correctly apply the order of operations but might still make simple mistakes: A=15% B=15% D=10% C=60%
- **Proficient**: Students here have a good grasp of the order of operations and can apply it well. They are likely to see that both statements are correct: A=5% B=5% D=5% C=85%
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the order of operations but are also adept at evaluating expressions. They will easily see the correctness of both statements: A=0% B=0% D=0% C=100%

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- **basic**: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
