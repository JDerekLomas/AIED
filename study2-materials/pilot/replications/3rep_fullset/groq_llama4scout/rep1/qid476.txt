To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question of writing \( 72 \% \) as a fraction, let's consider the nature of the question and common misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks to convert \( 72 \% \) into a fraction. This involves understanding that \( \% \) means "out of 100," so \( 72 \% = \frac{72}{100} \). Simplifying this fraction gives \( \frac{18}{25} \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve directly writing the percentage as a fraction without considering its simplest form or misinterpreting the percentage sign. For example, some might think \( 72 \% \) is \( \frac{72}{100} \) but not simplify it, or they might mistakenly think it's \( \frac{7.2}{10} \) or similar, though this isn't directly listed. Another misconception could be thinking \( 72 \% \) means 72 out of an unspecified total or misapplying conversion rules.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 7 \frac{2}{100} \) seems to misunderstand the concept of percentage and mixed numbers.
- Option B: \( \frac{1}{72} \) is a clear misconception, possibly arising from confusing the percentage with a fraction of 1.
- Option C: \( \frac{18}{25} \) is the correct simplification of \( \frac{72}{100} \).
- Option D: \( \text{None of these options} \) would be chosen if a student correctly converts \( 72 \% \) to a fraction but doesn't find it among the provided choices.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic conversions and are likely to choose incorrect options. They might pick A because it directly represents the numbers given without much thought, or B due to a lack of understanding of percentages. Option A could attract around 30%, B around 20%, C around 10% (if they somehow manage to simplify), and D around 40% (if they realize their answer isn't listed but can't find the correct one).
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors. They might lean towards A (20%) or B (15%) due to misconceptions, C (40%) if they understand the conversion, and D (25%) if they don't see their answer.
- **Proficient:** These students are likely to convert \( 72 \% \) to \( \frac{72}{100} \) and simplify to \( \frac{18}{25} \). So, C (70%), A (5%), B (5%), and D (20%).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level will easily convert and simplify, likely choosing C (90%), with small percentages for A, B, and D due to error or to verify their understanding.

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
- **basic:** A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=70% D=20%
- **advanced:** A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=70% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
