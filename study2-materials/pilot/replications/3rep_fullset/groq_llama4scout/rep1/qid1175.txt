To solve this, let's first convert Hannah's journey into minutes: \(3\) hours \(= 3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes. Adding the \(26\) minutes, Hannah's total journey is \(180 + 26 = 206\) minutes.

Tori's journey is given as \(204\) minutes. 

The difference in their journeys is \(206 - 204 = 2\) minutes.

Now, let's analyze the question and predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with conversions between hours and minutes or with subtraction. They might not correctly convert Hannah's journey into minutes or might make calculation errors.
  - A: \(206\) minutes (might seem correct but let's see if they calculate it properly)
  - B: \(122\) minutes (unlikely, as it doesn't relate to a simple miscalculation here)
  - C: \(2\) minutes (correct answer, but will they get it?)
  - D: \(410\) minutes (seems too high and incorrect)

- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp but might still make simple errors.
  - A: \(206\) minutes (could be a common mistake if they don’t subtract)
  - B: \(122\) minutes (not directly related to common errors here)
  - C: \(2\) minutes (should be achievable with correct calculation)
  - D: \(410\) minutes (unlikely, as it's far off)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and are less likely to make errors in conversion or subtraction.
  - A: \(206\) minutes (unlikely, as they should subtract)
  - B: \(122\) minutes (unlikely)
  - C: \(2\) minutes (most should get this)
  - D: \(410\) minutes (very unlikely)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are very confident and accurate.
  - A: \(206\) minutes (unlikely, as they know it's Hannah's time)
  - B: \(122\) minutes (unlikely)
  - C: \(2\) minutes (almost certainly correct)
  - D: \(410\) minutes (extremely unlikely)

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some might get Hannah's time right but not calculate difference), B=10% (random guess), C=40% (if they manage to calculate correctly), D=30% (large error)
- **Basic**: A=30% (might not subtract), B=15% (less likely), C=50% (should calculate correctly), D=5% (unlikely large mistake)
- **Proficient**: A=10% (unlikely to not subtract), B=5% (rare mistake), C=85% (correct calculation expected), D=0% (no chance)
- **Advanced**: A=5% (very rare mistake), B=0% (no chance), C=95% (expect correct answer), D=0% (no chance)

Thus, refining to actual percentages based on typical student performance:

below_basic: A=25% B=10% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=30% B=10% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
