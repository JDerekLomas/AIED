To approach this question, let's first understand what's being tested. The question involves finding the correct equation that represents the equality of areas of two rectangles. The dimensions of the rectangles are given as:

- Blue rectangle: side length = 4, base = \(3x - 2\)
- Yellow rectangle: side length = 2, base = \(5x + 2\)

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: area = side length \(\times\) base.

So, the area of the blue rectangle = \(4 \times (3x - 2)\) = \(12x - 8\)

And the area of the yellow rectangle = \(2 \times (5x + 2)\) = \(10x + 4\)

Given that the areas of these shapes are equal, we can set up the equation:
\[12x - 8 = 10x + 4\]

Let's examine the options:

A: \(12x - 8 = 10x + 4\)  
B: \(12x - 2 = 10x + 2\)  
C: \(8 + 6x - 4 = 4 + 10x + 4\)  
D: \(4 + 3x - 2 = 2 + 5x + 2\)

## Step 1: Analyze Option A
Option A directly matches our derived equation for equal areas: \(12x - 8 = 10x + 4\).

## 2: Analyze Option B
For option B, \(12x - 2 = 10x + 2\), simplifying gives \(2x = 4\) or \(x = 2\), which doesn't align with the correct equation.

## 3: Analyze Option C
Option C, \(8 + 6x - 4 = 4 + 10x + 4\), simplifies to \(4 + 6x = 8 + 10x\), which further simplifies to \(4x = -4\) or \(x = -1\). This does not match the area equality equation.

## 4: Analyze Option D
Option D, \(4 + 3x - 2 = 2 + 5x + 2\), simplifies to \(2 + 3x = 4 + 5x\), leading to \(2x = -2\) or \(x = -1\). This also does not match.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with algebraic expressions and equality. They might incorrectly simplify or not understand how to set up the equation. Option A is the correct answer, but these students might be more likely to choose an option that looks simpler or incorrectly solve the equation. Given the straightforward nature of A and potential confusion in other options, we might see:  
  below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a grasp of basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to understand the concept of area but might struggle with setting up the correct equation or simplifying.  
  basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid understanding of algebra and can apply it to solve problems. They are likely to quickly identify the correct equation.  
  proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the algebra but can also quickly analyze and solve such problems. They are very likely to choose the correct option.  
  advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
