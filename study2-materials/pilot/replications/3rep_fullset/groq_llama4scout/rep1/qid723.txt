To approach this question, let's analyze the task and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

The equation given is \(x^{2} - x - 9 = -6\), which simplifies to \(x^{2} - x - 3 = 0\). The question asks for the approximate solution to this equation based on a graph of \(y = x^{2} - x - 9\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
Students need to solve the equation \(x^{2} - x - 3 = 0\) by using the graph of \(y = x^{2} - x - 9\). To do this, they should adjust their understanding to the equation \(x^{2} - x - 9 = -6\), implying \(y = -6\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Difficulties
A common misconception could be not adjusting the equation correctly or misinterpreting how to use the graph. However, the graph provided shows \(y = x^{2} - x - 9\), and students are looking for where \(x^{2} - x - 9 = -6\), or \(y = -6\). This involves finding intersections with a horizontal line at \(y = -6\).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(x = -9\), which seems too low and not a solution based on rough estimation.
- Option B: \(x = 3.5, x = -2.5\), let's verify if these could be solutions.
- Option C: \(x = 2.2, x = -1.2\), also needs verification.
- Option D: \(No\ real\ solutions\), which would be incorrect if there are real roots.

## 4: Estimating Solutions
The equation to solve is \(x^{2} - x - 3 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula, \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -1\), and \(c = -3\), yields:
\[x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{(-1)^{2} - 4(1)(-3)}}{2(1)}\]
\[x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 12}}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2}\]
\[x \approx \frac{1 \pm 3.61}{2}\]
So, \(x \approx 2.305\) and \(x \approx -1.305\).

## 5: Matching Solutions to Options
- The solutions are approximately \(x = 2.2\) and \(x = -1.2\) when rounded to one decimal place.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students might struggle to use the graph or solve the quadratic equation. They might choose A or D due to lack of understanding.
- **Basic:** Students could attempt to solve it but might make calculation errors. They are likely to choose B or C based on rough estimations.
- **Proficient:** Students should accurately solve or estimate solutions. They would likely choose C.
- **Advanced:** Students would quickly and accurately solve the equation and use the graph effectively, choosing C.

## 7: Percentage Predictions
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (random guess), B=20%, C=20%, D=20%
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=30%, C=40%, D=20%
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=20%, C=70%, D=5%
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=5%, C=90%, D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=30% C=40% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=20% C=70% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
