To address this question, let's first analyze the function machine's operations and the claims made by Jo and Paul. The function machine takes an input \(n\), divides it by 5, and then adds 3. This can be represented algebraically as \(\frac{n}{5} + 3\).

Jo claims the output is \(\frac{n}{5} + 3\), which matches the correct operation of the function machine.

Paul claims the output is \(\frac{n+3}{5}\), which is a different operation: it adds 3 to \(n\) before dividing by 5.

## Step 1: Understanding the Claims
Jo's claim, \(\frac{n}{5} + 3\), directly corresponds to the sequence of operations shown in the function machine: divide \(n\) by 5 and then add 3.

## 2: Analyzing Paul's Claim
Paul's claim, \(\frac{n+3}{5}\), suggests adding 3 to \(n\) before dividing by 5, which does not match the operations in the function machine.

## 3: Evaluating the Difficulty of the Question
This question tests the understanding of the order of operations in a function machine. For students who are familiar with function machines and understand that operations are performed in a specific order (as shown), Jo's answer should be clearly correct. Paul's answer represents a common misconception where the order of operations is misunderstood.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with algebraic expressions and the concept of function machines. They might not fully understand the operations or how to apply them, leading to a higher chance of selecting an incorrect answer. Given the simplicity of the question, most might still lean towards one of the obviously incorrect options or not understand the machine's process, so: A=40% (Jo seems right but let's see), B=30% (Paul seems plausible), C=10% (unlikely to think both are correct), D=20% (neither, indicating confusion).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of algebra and function machines. They should recognize Jo's formula as correct but might be tempted by Paul's due to not fully grasping the sequence of operations. So: A=60%, B=30%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the sequence of operations clearly and can apply them accurately. They should easily identify Jo's answer as correct and Paul's as incorrect. Thus: A=80%, B=15%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the operations but can also quickly evaluate the claims. They should have no trouble identifying Jo as correct and Paul as incorrect. Hence: A=90%, B=8%, C=1%, D=1%.
