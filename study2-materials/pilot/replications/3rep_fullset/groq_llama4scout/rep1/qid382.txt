To solve this, let's first analyze the equation and the steps provided:

The equation given is \(27 = 9(1 + k)\).

## Step 1: Solve the equation to understand the correct steps.
To verify Isaac's steps, let's solve the equation properly:
\[27 = 9(1 + k)\]
Divide both sides by 9:
\[3 = 1 + k\]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[2 = k\]

## 2: Evaluate Isaac's steps.
- Step 1: \(3 = 1 + k\) is correct based on our solution.
- Step 2: \(2 = k\) is also correct based on our solution.

## 3: Consider the difficulty and potential misconceptions.
This question tests if students can identify correct algebraic manipulations. A common misconception might involve incorrect distribution or division, but in this case, the steps provided are straightforward and align with correct algebraic procedures.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra. They might not correctly solve the equation or verify the steps, potentially leading to a higher percentage choosing D (Both steps are incorrect) due to confusion or lack of understanding.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic algebra. They might correctly identify Step 1 as correct but be unsure about Step 2 or vice versa, but given the straightforward nature, they should mostly get it right.
- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with algebra and should easily verify both steps as correct, choosing C (Both steps are correct).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and should also easily verify both steps, likely choosing C.

## 5: Assign Percentages.
Given the clarity and simplicity of the correct steps:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (might see the first step as correct), B=10% (unlikely to see only step 2 as correct without understanding), C=30% (some might get it), D=40% (confusion).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=5%, C=80%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=0%, C=95%, D=0%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=100%, D=0%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=95% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
