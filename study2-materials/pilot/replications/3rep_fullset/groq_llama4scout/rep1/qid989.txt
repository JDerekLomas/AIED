## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks for the perimeter of a composite shape made from rectangles. The shape consists of three rectangles forming a step structure. The dimensions given are: the base is 23m long, the total vertical height is 22m, the top part's horizontal width is 6m, the first step's horizontal width is 7m, the bottom rectangle's vertical height is 5m, and the top rectangle's vertical height is 8m.

## 2: Determine the dimensions of each rectangle
- The bottom rectangle has a height of 5m. Since the base of the shape is 23m and the top part's width is 6m and the first step's width is 7m, the bottom rectangle's width is 23 - 6 - 7 = 10m.
- The middle rectangle has a height of 8m (since the top rectangle's height is 8m and the total height is 22m, with the bottom being 5m and the top 8m, the middle part must be 22 - 5 - 8 = 9m, but this is incorrect as it was a mistake in interpreting the heights of the rectangles) and a width of 7m.
- Correcting the interpretation: The total height is 22m, with the bottom part being 5m and the top part being 8m, so the middle part's height must be 22 - 5 - 8 = 9m. However, we know the heights directly: bottom 5m, middle 9m, top 8m.

## 3: Calculate the perimeter
To calculate the perimeter, we need to add all the outer sides of the shape.
- The bottom side is 23m.
- The top side is 6m.
- The vertical sides are: 5m (bottom) + 9m (middle) + 8m (top) = 22m. However, since these are the heights and contribute to the vertical perimeter, we count the sides: 
  - The left side is 22m (5m + 9m + 8m).
  - The right side is also 22m.

## 4: Sum the lengths to find the perimeter
The perimeter = bottom side + top side + 2 * (sum of heights) = 23m + 6m + 2 * 22m = 23 + 6 + 44 = 73m.

## 5: Evaluate the answer choices
None of the provided calculations match directly with A, B, C, or D, suggesting a miscalculation in step 4 or a need to reassess. Let's correct and simplify:
- Bottom length: 23m
- Top length: 6m
- Left and right heights combined: 22m (as the total vertical height)
- The correct calculation directly from dimensions given without incorrect assumptions:
  - Perimeter = 23 (base) + 6 (top) + 8 (top height) + 9 (middle height) + 5 (bottom height) + 7 (first step width, which is on one side) is incorrect. Correctly, it's the outer lengths: 23 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 9 + 7 = 58, no, that counts inside. Correctly it's: base (23) + top (6) + 2*(side) where side = 22 (total height).
  - Correct perimeter calculation directly: 
    - 23 (bottom) + 6 (top) + 2*22 (sides) = 23 + 6 + 44 = 73.

## 6: Realize the mistake in interpretation and correct
Given the shape and usual errors, let's consider what students might do:
- Many might add all segments (which would be wrong).
- Some might not add the heights correctly.

## 7: Final calculation check
The sides are 23m and 6m for top and bottom, and 22m for each side (left and right). So, perimeter = 23 + 6 + 22 + 22 = 73m.

## 8: Assessing student responses
Given no option matches 73m:
- **below_basic**: Many might choose D (71m) due to a simple miscalculation or not understanding perimeter. A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%
- **basic**: Might get confused with lengths and heights, could choose A, B, or C due to calculation errors. A=20%, B=30%, C=30%, D=20%
- **proficient**: Should calculate correctly but might be distracted by dimensions. A=10%, B=40%, C=40%, D=10%
- **advanced**: Would likely calculate correctly and not choose any given option. A=0%, B=
