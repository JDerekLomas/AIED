## Step 1: Understand the question and the formula for distance between two points
The question provides two points, \( (2,-5) \) and \( (-7,1) \), and asks for the distance between them using the formula \( \sqrt{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right)^{2}} \). The student has labeled the points as \( x_{1}=2 \), \( y_{1}=-5 \), \( x_{2}=-7 \), and \( y_{2}=1 \).

## 2: Calculate the distance using the given formula
To find the distance, we substitute the given values into the formula:
\( \sqrt{(-7-2)^{2}+(1-(-5))^{2}} \)
\( = \sqrt{(-9)^{2}+(6)^{2}} \)
\( = \sqrt{81+36} \)
\( = \sqrt{117} \)

## 3: Analyze the potential misconceptions and errors
A common misconception could be incorrect substitution into the formula or errors in calculating the squares and square root. However, the question seems straightforward, and the calculation does not inherently suggest a simple mistake like forgetting to square the differences or misinterpreting the coordinates.

## 4: Consider the answer choices and predict student responses
- A: \( \sqrt{6} \) seems too small and not related to the calculation.
- B: \( \sqrt{30} \) also seems too small.
- C: \( -\sqrt{45} \) is incorrect because distance cannot be negative, and \( \sqrt{45} \) does not match the calculation.
- D: \( \sqrt{117} \) matches the correct calculation.

## 5: Predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substituting into the formula or calculating the squares. They might choose A or B due to miscalculation or not completing the calculation. C could be chosen by those who calculate but forget distance is positive. D is the correct answer but might be challenging for this group to achieve correctly.
- **Basic**: Students here are more likely to get the correct calculation but might still make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are less likely to choose A or B but might still consider C if they forget the distance must be positive.
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately calculate the distance and choose D. They are less likely to make simple mistakes.
- **Advanced**: These students will almost certainly choose D, as they are comfortable with the formula and calculations.

## 6: Assign percentages based on predicted student performance
Given the calculations and potential for error:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (miscalculation leading to small numbers), B=15% (similar), C=10% (forgetting positive), D=55% (some manage to get it right).
- **Basic**: A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.
- **Proficient**: A=1%, B=1%, C=1%, D=97%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
proficient: A=1% B=1% C=1% D=97%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
