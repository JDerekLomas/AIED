## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a diagram with three intersecting lines. At one intersection, two angles are marked: 138 degrees and 42 degrees. The angle opposite the 42-degree angle is marked as \( p \). The task is to find the size of angle \( p \).

## 2: Identifying Relevant Geometric Principles
In geometry, when two lines intersect, the angles formed are vertical angles (or opposite angles), which are always equal in measure. Additionally, the sum of the angles around any point (or vertex) is 360 degrees.

## 3: Applying Geometric Principles to the Given Diagram
Given that one angle is 138 degrees and another is 42 degrees, and they are at the same intersection point, we can find the angle \( p \) by understanding that \( p \) and 42 degrees are vertical angles, hence equal.

## 4: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions and Errors
A common misconception might involve incorrectly applying angle sum properties or misidentifying angle relationships. However, the question directly tests the understanding of vertical angles.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic geometric concepts or misapply formulas. They might choose an option based on incorrect calculations or wrongly assuming \( p \) is related to 138 degrees directly (C) or think there's not enough information (D).
- **Basic:** Basic level students should recognize that \( p \) and 42 degrees are vertical angles and thus equal. They might still be tempted by obviously incorrect options but should lean towards B.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students will easily identify \( p = 42^{\circ} \) due to understanding of vertical angles. They are less likely to be misled by other options.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will not only correctly identify \( p = 42^{\circ} \) but also understand why other options are incorrect, likely without even considering them.

## 6: Estimating Percentages for Each Option
- **Below Basic:** A=10% (some might calculate incorrectly), B=40% (recognize vertical angles), C=30% (misinterpret 138 degrees), D=20% (think not enough info).
- **Basic:** A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=2%, B=95%, C=2%, D=1%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=99%, C=1%, D=0%.

## 7: Finalizing Predictions
Given the straightforward nature of the question regarding vertical angles, most students, even at the basic level, should be able to identify \( p = 42^{\circ} \) correctly.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
advanced: A=0% B=99% C=1% D=0%
