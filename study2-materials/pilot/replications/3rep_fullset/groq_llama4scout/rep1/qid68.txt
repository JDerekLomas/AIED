To approach this question, let's analyze each option in the context of real solutions for a quadratic equation, particularly focusing on the structure of each option.

## Step 1: Understanding Quadratic Equations
A quadratic equation in its standard form is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For our case, we're dealing with equations in the form of \((w-4)^2 \pm c = 0\) or simply \((w-4)^2 = 0\). 

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A: \((w-4)^2 - 16 = 0\). This simplifies to \((w-4)^2 = 16\). Taking the square root of both sides gives \(w-4 = \pm4\), leading to solutions \(w = 8\) or \(w = 0\). So, this equation has real solutions.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B: \((w-4)^2 + 16 = 0\). This equation simplifies to \((w-4)^2 = -16\). Since the square of any real number cannot be negative, there are no real solutions for \(w\).

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C: \((w-4)^2 = 0\). This implies \(w - 4 = 0\), so \(w = 4\). This equation has one real solution.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D: \((w-4)^2 - 4 = 0\). This simplifies to \((w-4)^2 = 4\), which means \(w - 4 = \pm2\). Therefore, \(w = 6\) or \(w = 2\). This equation has real solutions.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to solve the equations but are likely to recognize that Option B involves adding a positive number to a square, which could intuitively suggest it has no solutions. However, they might mistakenly think all squares equal zero or have trouble with the concept of negative values under the square root. So, they might choose B but also make errors with A, C, or D. 
  - A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%

- **Basic**: Students here understand basic quadratic concepts. They should easily solve A, C, and D but recognize B has no real solutions due to the nature of squares being non-negative. 
  - A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%

- **Proficient**: These students are familiar with quadratic equations and should quickly identify B as having no real solutions. They might take a moment to verify A, C, and D have solutions.
  - A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%

- **Advanced**: Advanced students are highly confident in their algebraic manipulations and understanding of quadratic equations. They will immediately recognize B as the equation with no real solutions.
  - A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
