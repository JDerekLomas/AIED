## Step 1: Understand the question and the iterative formula
The question provides an iterative formula \(x_{n+1} = 5 - \frac{1}{x_n}\) and a starting value \(x_1 = 2\). The task is to find the solution to \(x = 5 - \frac{1}{x}\) to 2 decimal places, which essentially means finding the fixed point of the iterative formula.

## 2: Solve the equation \(x = 5 - \frac{1}{x}\) directly
To find the fixed point, we solve the equation \(x = 5 - \frac{1}{x}\). Multiplying through by \(x\), we get \(x^2 = 5x - 1\). Rearranging gives \(x^2 - 5x + 1 = 0\). We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = 1\).

## 3: Apply the quadratic formula
Substituting \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the quadratic formula gives \(x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 4}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{21}}{2}\).

## 4: Calculate the roots
Calculating the roots: \(x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{21}}{2}\). Since \(\sqrt{21} \approx 4.58\), the roots are \(x \approx \frac{5 + 4.58}{2} = 4.79\) and \(x \approx \frac{5 - 4.58}{2} = 0.21\).

## 5: Consider the iterative process and stability of fixed points
The iterative formula \(x_{n+1} = 5 - \frac{1}{x_n}\) will converge to one of these fixed points depending on the initial condition \(x_1 = 2\). The fixed point \(x \approx 0.21\) is unstable for this iteration because if \(x_n\) is close to 0.21, \(x_{n+1}\) will be large, moving away from 0.21. The fixed point \(x \approx 4.79\) is stable.

## 6: Evaluate answer choices based on calculations
Given that the stable fixed point is approximately \(4.79\), let's evaluate the answer choices:
- A: \(4.78\)
- B: \(4.79128 \ldots\)
- C: \(4.8\)
- D: \(4.79\)

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students might not understand the iterative process or solving the quadratic equation. They might approximate or choose an answer without calculation. Expect a spread across all options but with a higher chance of A, C, or D due to rounding.
- **Basic**: Students can solve the quadratic equation and understand the concept of convergence. They are likely to calculate or approximate the solution to be around \(4.79\), so D is a strong candidate.
- **Proficient**: These students will accurately solve the equation and possibly iterate to confirm convergence. They will likely choose B or D, with a precise calculation leading to B.
- **Advanced**: Students will not only solve it accurately but also understand the implications of the iterative formula. They will choose B for its precision.

## 8: Assign percentages
Given the calculations and understanding:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
- **Basic**: A=10% B=20% C=20% D=50%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=40% C=10% D=45%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=80% C=5% D=15%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=20% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=40% C=10% D=45%
advanced: A=0% B=80% C=5% D=15%
