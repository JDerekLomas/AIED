To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or understanding related to finding the range of a data set.

The range of a data set is found by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value. This process does not inherently require checking the units of the answer (though units are important in many math contexts), adding all the numbers together (which is part of finding the mean), or writing the numbers in ascending or descending order (though this can be a helpful step for identifying the smallest and largest numbers).

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to identify which step is never needed when finding the range. The correct answer is "C: Add all the numbers together," because adding all the numbers together is a step required to find the mean, not the range.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A, "Subtract the smallest number from the largest number," is actually a required step for finding the range. Students who understand how to find the range should not choose this as a step that is never needed.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, "Check the units of your answer," while generally good practice, is not specifically necessary for calculating the range, as the range will have the same units as the data. However, this might not be immediately obvious to all students, especially if they are used to checking units in other types of calculations.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C, "Add all the numbers together," is clearly a step that is never needed for finding the range but is necessary for finding the mean. This should be recognizable to students with a good understanding of the difference between range and mean.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D, "Write the numbers in ascending or descending order," can be helpful for easily identifying the smallest and largest numbers but is not strictly necessary if one can quickly identify these numbers in their original form.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle to understand the question and the processes. They might be more likely to choose an option that seems like a standard procedure (A or D) or not understand the relevance of adding numbers together (C), potentially leading to:
  - below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%

- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding but might still confuse procedures. They are more likely to recognize that adding all numbers (C) is not for the range but might be tricked into thinking other steps are always necessary:
  - basic: A=50% B=25% C=20% D=5%

- **Proficient:** Students here understand the concepts well and should easily identify that adding all numbers together is not needed for the range:
  - proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the procedure but are also less likely to fall for common misconceptions. They should clearly see that adding all numbers (C) is the step never needed:
  - advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%

Given the specific question and typical student understanding:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
