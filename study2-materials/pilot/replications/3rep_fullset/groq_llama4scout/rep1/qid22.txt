To approach this question, let's analyze the calculations and potential misconceptions involved.

## Step 1: Understanding Tom's Statement
Tom claims that if \( 3748 + 426 = 4174 \), then \( 3748 + 427 \) must equal \( 4175 \). This involves understanding the effect of increasing one of the addends by 1. If \( 3748 + 426 = 4174 \), then adding 1 more to 426 (making it 427) would increase the sum by 1, making \( 3748 + 427 = 4175 \). This statement seems mathematically sound because increasing one addend by 1 increases the sum by 1.

## 2: Understanding Katie's Statement
Katie claims that if \( 3748 - 426 = 3322 \), then \( 3748 - 427 \) must equal \( 3323 \). This involves understanding the effect of decreasing the subtrahend by 1 (or increasing the number being subtracted by 1). If \( 3748 - 426 = 3322 \), then subtracting 1 more from 3748 (or equivalently, subtracting 427 from 3748) would decrease the result by 1, making \( 3748 - 427 = 3321 \), not \( 3323 \). This indicates a potential misunderstanding in Katie's statement.

## 3: Identifying the Misconception
The key misconception here could be in Katie's statement. Many students might mistakenly think that subtracting a larger number results in a larger answer, or they might not correctly adjust the result when changing the numbers in a subtraction problem. However, the specific numbers and operations in this question might make it more or less prone to error based on how straightforward the calculations are.

## 4: Assessing Difficulty and Error Likelihood
- Tom's statement is straightforward and mathematically correct.
- Katie's statement suggests a potential misconception because subtracting 427 instead of 426 would decrease the result by 1, making it \( 3321 \), not \( 3323 \).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
Given the above analysis:
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding of how changes in numbers affect the outcome. They might incorrectly assess both statements or understand neither correctly. 
  - A: 20% (some might randomly select)
  - B: 15% (similar reasoning)
  - C: 10% (unlikely to understand both correctly)
  - D: 55% (most might recognize an issue but not articulate correctly)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic operations but might still make errors in applying them to new situations or explaining their reasoning.
  - A: 30% (see Tom's logic)
  - B: 20% (misunderstand Katie's logic)
  - C: 40% (understand Tom but might be unsure about Katie)
  - D: 10% (recognize both are incorrect or not)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the operations well and can apply them.
  - A: 5% (unlikely to think only Tom is correct if they understand Katie's mistake)
  - B: 10% (recognize Katie's error)
  - C: 80% (see the logic in both but recognize Katie's mistake)
  - D: 5% (understand both are incorrect)

- **Advanced**: Students who are advanced would easily see through both statements.
  - A: 0% (advanced students see Tom's correctness)
  - B: 5% (misinterpret Katie)
  - C: 90% (clearly see Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrectness)
  - D: 5% (for completeness, though unlikely)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
