To solve the given quadratic equation \(x^{2} + 7x = 8\), let's first consider what the most useful first step would be. The goal is to set the equation to 0 or to a form where we can easily apply the quadratic formula or factorize it.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to identify the most useful first step in solving the quadratic equation \(x^{2} + 7x = 8\).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: Divide by \(x\). This would be inappropriate as it assumes \(x \neq 0\) and could potentially lose a solution.
- Option B: Square root both sides of the equation. This is not a standard first step for solving quadratic equations and would not directly apply here without first isolating \(x^{2}\).
- Option C: Subtract \(7x\) from both sides of the equation. This would result in \(x^{2} = -7x + 8\), which still doesn't directly help with solving by simple factorization or the quadratic formula without further steps.
- Option D: Subtract \(8\) from both sides of the equation. This leads to \(x^{2} + 7x - 8 = 0\), which is a standard form of a quadratic equation (\(ax^{2} + bx + c = 0\)) and can be solved by factorization, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula.

## 3: Identifying the Most Useful First Step
The most straightforward and useful first step to solve the quadratic equation \(x^{2} + 7x = 8\) would be to get it into the standard quadratic form. Therefore, subtracting \(8\) from both sides gives \(x^{2} + 7x - 8 = 0\), making option D the correct first step.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand the structure of quadratic equations or the steps to solve them. They might be tempted by simple or seemingly direct methods.
  - A: 20% (Dividing by \(x\) might seem like a way to simplify)
  - B: 15% (Square root could seem like a direct method)
  - C: 10% (Subtracting \(7x\) doesn't seem directly helpful but could be considered)
  - D: 55% (Recognizing the need to set the equation to 0)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make procedural errors.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 20% (Might consider rearranging but not to standard form)
  - D: 65%

- **Proficient:** These students understand quadratic equations and standard procedures.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 0% (Recognize square root as inappropriate)
  - C: 10%
  - D: 85%

- **Advanced:** Students with a strong grasp of algebra and problem-solving strategies.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 0%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=20% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=10% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
