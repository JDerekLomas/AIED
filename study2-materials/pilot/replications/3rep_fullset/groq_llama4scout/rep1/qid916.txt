To approach this question, let's first understand the rounding rules and then analyze the statements made by Jo and Paul.

Rounding to 1 significant figure involves looking at the second significant figure. If it's 5 or more, you round up the first significant figure. If it's less than 5, you leave the first significant figure unchanged. For rounding to 1 decimal place, you look at the second decimal place: if it's 5 or more, you round up the first decimal place; if it's less than 5, you leave the first decimal place unchanged.

## Step 1: Analyze Jo's Statement
Jo says \( \mathbf{9 9 . 9 6} \) rounded to \( 1 \) significant figure is \( \mathbf{1 0 0} \). When rounding \( 99.96 \) to 1 significant figure, we look at the second significant figure, which is 9. Since 9 is greater than 5, we round up the first significant figure (which is 9) to a 0 and then consider the number of significant figures, resulting in \( 100 \) or \( 1 \times 10^2 \) in scientific notation. This makes Jo's statement correct because \( 99.96 \) rounded to 1 significant figure indeed becomes \( 100 \) or more accurately for significant figures, \( 1 \times 10^2 \).

## 2: Analyze Paul's Statement
Paul says \( \mathbf{9 9 . 9 6} \) rounded to \( 1 \) decimal place is \( \mathbf{1 0 0} \). When rounding \( 99.96 \) to 1 decimal place, we look at the second decimal place, which is 6. Since 6 is greater than 5, we round up the first decimal place (which is 9) to a 0, resulting in \( 100.0 \). Thus, Paul's statement is also correct because \( 99.96 \) rounded to 1 decimal place is indeed \( 100.0 \).

## 3: Determine the Correctness of Statements and Predicted Student Responses
Both Jo and Paul are correct based on the rounding rules. 

- For students at the **below_basic** level, there might be confusion about rounding rules. They might not fully understand or apply the rules correctly, leading to potential misconceptions. However, given the clarity of the question, most might still manage to identify that both are correct or at least not confidently choose incorrect options without understanding. Predicted responses could be: below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%

- For **basic** level students, understanding of rounding to significant figures and decimal places is developing. They are likely to apply basic rules but might still make errors due to misunderstanding the application. Thus, they might lean towards recognizing both as correct but could be swayed by partial understanding. Predicted: basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%

- **Proficient** students have a solid grasp of rounding rules. They should easily recognize both statements as correct based on standard rounding practices. Predicted: proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%

- **Advanced** students not only understand the rules but can also apply them in nuanced situations. They should have no trouble recognizing the correctness of both statements. Predicted: advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
