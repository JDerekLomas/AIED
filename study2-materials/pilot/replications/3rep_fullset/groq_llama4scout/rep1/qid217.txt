To approach this question, let's first analyze what it's testing and then consider how students at different ability levels might respond.

The equation given is \(0.15 = 0.5p\). To solve for \(p\), one needs to divide both sides by 0.5, which yields \(p = \frac{0.15}{0.5} = 0.3\).

## Step 1: Identify the correct solution
The correct solution to the equation \(0.15 = 0.5p\) is \(p = 0.3\), which corresponds to option C.

## 2: Consider common misconceptions or errors
A common error might involve incorrect handling of decimals or fractions. For instance, students might incorrectly divide or multiply, or they might not fully understand how to solve for \(p\).

## 3: Analyze option A
Option A, \(p = -0.35\), suggests a misunderstanding of the equation, possibly adding or subtracting incorrectly, or incorrectly applying operations.

## 4: Analyze option B
Option B, \(p = \frac{10}{3}\), seems to relate to a conversion error, possibly thinking of fractions or converting decimals incorrectly.

## 5: Analyze option D
Option D, \(p = 0.75\), seems to suggest adding or incorrectly manipulating the numbers given.

## 6: Consider student ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations, especially with decimals. They might not accurately solve the equation and could choose any option based on incorrect calculations.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are more likely to choose an option that reflects a common arithmetic error.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the basic operations and can apply them correctly. They are less likely to make simple mistakes but might still choose incorrect options if they misunderstand the operations needed.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to solve the equation correctly with ease.

## 7: Predict student responses
Given the simplicity of the equation and the straightforward nature of solving for \(p\), most students, even at the basic level, should be able to solve it correctly.

- **Below Basic:** A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25% (This group might struggle, and incorrect options are more appealing due to lack of understanding.)
- **Basic:** A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5% (Most get it right, but a few might make simple errors.)
- **Proficient:** A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1% (This group is very likely to get it right.)
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0% (This group will get it right without any issues.)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
