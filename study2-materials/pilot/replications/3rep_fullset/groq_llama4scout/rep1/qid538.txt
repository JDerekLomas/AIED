## Step 1: Understand the question and the shapes involved
The question involves finding the perimeter of a compound shape made up of a square and a regular pentagon. The area of the square is given as \( 196 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \). To find the perimeter, we first need to determine the side lengths of both the square and the pentagon.

## 2: Calculate the side length of the square
The area of a square is given by \( \text{side}^2 = \text{area} \). Given the area of the square is \( 196 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \), we find the side length: \( \text{side} = \sqrt{196} = 14 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 3: Consider the properties of a regular pentagon
A regular pentagon has 5 equal sides and 5 equal angles. However, to find its perimeter, we need the length of one side, which is not directly provided.

## 4: Analyze the given options and potential misconceptions
- Option A: \( 14 \mathrm{~cm} \) seems too short for a perimeter.
- Option B: \( 343 \mathrm{~cm} \) seems excessively large.
- Option C: \( 112 \mathrm{~cm} \) could be plausible.
- Option D: \( 98 \mathrm{~cm} \) could also be plausible.

## 5: Determine the side length of the regular pentagon
The question does not directly provide the side length of the pentagon, but it implies that the square and pentagon share an edge. Thus, one side of the pentagon is \( 14 \mathrm{~cm} \), equal to the side of the square.

## 6: Calculate the perimeter of the compound shape
The perimeter of the compound shape is the sum of the perimeters of the square and the pentagon minus twice the length of the shared side (since one side of each shape is inside the compound shape and not part of its perimeter). The perimeter of the square is \( 4 \times 14 = 56 \mathrm{~cm} \), and the perimeter of the pentagon is \( 5 \times 14 = 70 \mathrm{~cm} \). The shared side is \( 14 \mathrm{~cm} \), so we subtract \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \mathrm{~cm} \) to avoid counting it twice.

## 7: Perform the perimeter calculation
The total perimeter is \( 56 + 70 - 2 \times 14 = 56 + 70 - 28 = 98 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 8: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students might struggle with calculating the side length of the square or understanding the concept of perimeter. They might choose A or B due to miscalculation or misunderstanding.
- **Basic:** Students could calculate the side of the square but might struggle with the pentagon's contribution or incorrectly calculate the total perimeter. They might lean towards D as it directly relates to the square's side.
- **Proficient:** Students would likely correctly calculate the side length of the square and understand how to combine the perimeters. They would likely choose D.
- **Advanced:** Students would not only correctly calculate but also consider the efficiency of their method. They would also choose D.

## 9: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (too low but simple), B=20% (large and incorrect), C=10% (unlikely), D=40% (direct relation to square).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=10%, C=20% (plausible but requires calculation), D=60%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=5%, C=20%, D=70%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=10%, D=90%.

The best answer is D. 

Given the detailed thought process and without specific data on student performance, here is a reasoned estimate:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=20% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=10% D=90%
