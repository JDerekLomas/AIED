To solve this, let's first calculate the perimeters of the two shapes and then find the difference between them.

The rectangle has a base length of 13cm and a side length of 5cm. The perimeter \(P_r\) of a rectangle is given by \(P_r = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})\). So, \(P_r = 2 \times (13 + 5) = 2 \times 18 = 36\) cm.

The isosceles triangle has a base length of 4cm and a side length of 16cm. The perimeter \(P_t\) of the triangle is given by \(P_t = \text{base} + 2 \times \text{side length}\) (since it's isosceles). So, \(P_t = 4 + 2 \times 16 = 4 + 32 = 36\) cm.

The difference between the perimeters is \(36 - 36 = 0\) cm.

Now, let's analyze the question and predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

- **below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with calculating perimeters or understanding the question. They might not accurately calculate the perimeters or might confuse the shapes.
  - A: \(20\%\) (guessing or incorrect calculation)
  - B: \(15\%\) (incorrect calculation or misunderstanding)
  - C: \(40\%\) (some might get it right by chance or correct calculation)
  - D: \(25\%\) (large incorrect guess)

- **basic**: Students at this level can calculate perimeters but might make careless mistakes or not fully understand the implications of the calculations.
  - A: \(10\%\) (minor calculation error)
  - B: \(20\%\) (significant calculation error)
  - C: \(60\%\) (correct calculation and understanding)
  - D: \(10\%\) (large incorrect guess)

- **proficient**: Students at this level are expected to accurately calculate perimeters and understand the question.
  - A: \(5\%\) (careless mistake)
  - B: \(5\%\) (unlikely but possible mistake)
  - C: \(85\%\) (correct understanding and calculation)
  - D: \(5\%\) (unlikely guess)

- **advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply it accurately.
  - A: \(0\%\) (unlikely mistake)
  - B: \(0\%\) (correct understanding prevents this)
  - C: \(95\%\) (accurate calculation and understanding)
  - D: \(5\%\) (extremely unlikely guess)

Therefore, based on the analysis:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
