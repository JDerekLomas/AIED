## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks students to determine the vector that describes how to get from point \( P \) to point \( Q \) on a grid, where \( P \) is 4 squares left and 2 squares up from \( Q \).

## 2: Identify the correct vector
To get from \( P \) to \( Q \), we need to move 4 squares to the right (since \( P \) is 4 squares left of \( Q \)) and 2 squares down (since \( P \) is 2 squares up from \( Q \)). The vector that represents moving right is positive and moving down is negative. Therefore, the correct vector from \( P \) to \( Q \) is \( \left(\begin{array}{c}4 \\ -2\end{array}\right) \), which corresponds to option C.

## 3: Analyze potential misconceptions and difficulties
A common misconception could be confusing the direction of the vector or misinterpreting the grid. Students might mistakenly think the vector is from \( Q \) to \( P \) or confuse the coordinates. However, the grid and the description provided should help clarify the direction.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding vectors, grid movements, or interpreting the question. They might choose an option that seems to match the description without fully understanding vector notation. Option A \( \left(\begin{array}{l}2 \\ 4\end{array}\right) \) and Option D \( \left(\begin{array}{c}-2 \\ 4\end{array}\right) \) could be tempting if students misinterpret the directions or the vector notation. Option B \( \left(\begin{array}{l}4 \\ 2\end{array}\right) \) might also be chosen if students confuse the direction. So, for below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of vectors and grid movements. They are likely to understand the concept but might make simple errors in calculation or direction. The correct answer, C, should be more recognizable, but there might still be confusion. So, for basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%.

- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid understanding of vectors and are less likely to make errors in interpreting the grid or calculating the vector. They should easily identify the correct vector. So, for proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding of vectors and can apply them in various contexts. They are highly likely to choose the correct option with ease. So, for advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%.

## 5: Finalize predictions
Based on the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
