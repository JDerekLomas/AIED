## Step 1: Understand the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for eliminating the \( q \)s in the given pairs of simultaneous equations.

## 2: Analyze the question
The question presents two pairs of simultaneous equations and asks what operation should be performed on each pair to eliminate \( q \). The pairs are:
1. \( 2p - 4q = 6 \) and \( 7p + 4q = 9 \)
2. \( 2p - 4q = 6 \) and \( 7p - 4q = 9 \)

## 3: Solve for Pair 1
For Pair 1, to eliminate \( q \), we need to add the two equations because the coefficients of \( q \) are \( -4 \) and \( 4 \), which are opposites. So, \( (2p - 4q) + (7p + 4q) = 6 + 9 \), simplifying to \( 9p = 15 \).

## 4: Solve for Pair 2
For Pair 2, the coefficients of \( q \) are \( -4 \) and \( -4 \), which are the same. To eliminate \( q \), we need to subtract one equation from the other. So, \( (7p - 4q) - (2p - 4q) = 9 - 6 \), simplifying to \( 5p = 3 \).

## 5: Determine the correct operation for each pair
- For Pair 1, we need to Add the two equations.
- For Pair 2, we need to Subtract one equation from the other.

## 6: Match to given options
The correct approach is to Add Pair 1 and Subtract Pair 2, which matches option A: Add Pair \( 1 \) and Subtract Pair \( 2 \).

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of eliminating variables. They might randomly choose or apply incorrect operations. Given the simplicity of the question, some might guess correctly, but a significant portion might not understand the process. Let's assume A=30%, B=20%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebraic operations but might make simple mistakes. They are more likely to understand that adding or subtracting can eliminate variables but might confuse the operations. Let's assume A=50%, B=25%, C=15%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: Students at this level are comfortable with algebraic manipulations. They understand how to eliminate variables and are less likely to make mistakes. Let's assume A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply their knowledge accurately. They will almost certainly choose the correct option. Let's assume A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.

## 8: Provide the final prediction
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
