To approach this question, let's analyze the equation and the graph provided, and then predict the student responses based on ability levels.

The equation given is \( y = 5 - 0.5x \), and the task is to find the solution to \( 5 - 0.5x = 6 \) using the graph.

## Step 1: Understanding the Equation and Graph
The graph of \( y = 5 - 0.5x \) shows a straight line with a y-intercept at (0,5) and an x-intercept at (10,0). This means when \( x = 0 \), \( y = 5 \), and when \( y = 0 \), \( x = 10 \).

## 2: Solving the Given Equation
To solve \( 5 - 0.5x = 6 \), we rearrange the equation:
\( 5 - 0.5x = 6 \)
\( -0.5x = 1 \)
\( x = -2 \)

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( x = -2 \)
- Option B: \( x = 2 \)
- Option C: \( x = 5 \)
- Option D: \( x = 10 \)

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulation and understanding the graph. They might not solve the equation correctly and could choose any option based on a misunderstanding. Given the graph, they might think \( x = 2 \) or \( x = 5 \) could be solutions if they misinterpret the graph or the equation. However, without calculation, \( x = -2 \) seems unlikely to be considered. So, let's assume \( A = 20\% \) (if they somehow managed to get it), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 30\% \), \( D = 20\% \).
- **Basic:** Students here can handle simple equations and might understand the graph. They could attempt to solve the equation or use the graph. Solving it correctly yields \( x = -2 \), so \( A = 60\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 10\% \).
- **Proficient:** These students can solve equations competently and interpret graphs well. They should easily solve \( 5 - 0.5x = 6 \) to get \( x = -2 \). Thus, \( A = 90\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 3\% \), \( D = 2\% \).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong understanding of algebra and graphs. They will solve the equation with ease and choose \( x = -2 \). Hence, \( A = 98\% \), \( B = 1\% \), \( C = 0.5\% \), \( D = 0.5\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
