## Step 1: Understand the question and the graph
The question presents a graph with a straight line passing through points (-4, 4), (-3, 3), (-2, 2), and so on, indicating a line with a negative slope. The line appears to pass through the origin (0,0) and has a slope of -1, since for every unit increase in x, y decreases by one unit. This means the equation of the line can be represented as y = -x.

## 2: Determine the inequality represented by the shaded region
Given that the line passes through the origin and has a slope of -1, its equation is y = -x. To determine which side of the line is shaded, we need to test a point. However, the question does not provide a visual of the shaded region, so we'll assume the shaded region is on one side of the line y = -x.

## 3: Analyze option C and D
Options C and D involve the inequality y > -x and y < -x, respectively. If the shaded region is above the line y = -x, the correct answer would be C (y > -x). If it's below, the correct answer would be D (y < -x).

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and student understanding
Students often struggle with inequalities and graphing, especially when it comes to determining which side of the line is represented by the inequality. A common error is confusing the direction of the inequality or not testing points correctly.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic:** Students at this level may not fully understand how to interpret graphs of inequalities or may confuse the symbols. They might randomly select an option or choose based on a superficial understanding.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might struggle with the concept of testing points or understanding the slope and intercept of the line.
- **Proficient:** These students understand linear equations and can interpret basic inequalities but might still make careless mistakes if they're not careful with the graph and inequality symbols.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of both linear equations and inequalities, making it less likely for them to choose incorrect options.

## 6: Estimate the percentage of students choosing each option
Given the line y = -x and assuming the shaded region is above it (which would be a common scenario for testing inequalities):
- The correct answer would be C: \( y > -x \).
- A and B (\( y > x \) and \( y < x \)) do not match the line \( y = -x \) and are less likely to be chosen by proficient or advanced students but might be considered by those below basic or basic levels due to lack of understanding.
- D (\( y < -x \)) would represent the area below the line \( y = -x \), which is the opposite of what we'd expect if the shading is above the line.

## 7: Assign percentages
- **Below_basic:** A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20% (lack of understanding leads to random or incorrect choices)
- **Basic:** A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20% (some understanding but prone to errors)
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10% (good understanding, minor errors)
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10% (strong understanding, very few errors)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
