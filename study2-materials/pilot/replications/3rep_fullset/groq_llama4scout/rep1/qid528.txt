To approach this question, let's consider what students need to do to answer it correctly and how the specifics of the question might affect students at different ability levels.

The task is to factorize \( x^{2}+13 x+30 \) and determine which multiplication will help with this. To factorize the quadratic expression, students need to find two numbers that multiply to 30 and add up to 13. These numbers are 3 and 10 because \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \) and \( 3 + 10 = 13 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the task
Students must identify that the correct factors of 30 that add up to 13 are 3 and 10.

## 2: Analyzing the options
- Option A: \( 1 \times 30 \) adds up to 31.
- Option B: \( 2 \times 15 \) adds up to 17.
- Option C: \( 3 \times 10 \) adds up to 13.
- Option D: \( 5 \times 6 \) adds up to 11.

## 3: Considering student responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with basic multiplication facts and adding numbers. They might not even attempt to factorize or could randomly select an option. Given the simplicity of the multiplication facts here, they might still be able to eliminate some options but are likely to make errors. Option C is the correct answer, but without a strong understanding of factorization, they might choose an option that seems "right" to them. \( A=40\% B=30\% C=20\% D=10\% \)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a grasp of basic multiplication and addition but might not be fluent in factorization. They could work through the options to see which pairs add to 13, but might make careless mistakes. \( A=20\% B=20\% C=50\% D=10\% \)

- **Proficient:** These students are comfortable with factorization and can likely quickly identify the correct pair. They understand the process and can apply it efficiently. \( A=5\% B=5\% C=85\% D=5\% \)

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only can solve this quickly but also understand the underlying mathematics well. They would easily identify the correct option and might even be able to factor the quadratic expression directly. \( A=0\% B=0\% C=95\% D=5\% \)

Given these considerations, here's the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
