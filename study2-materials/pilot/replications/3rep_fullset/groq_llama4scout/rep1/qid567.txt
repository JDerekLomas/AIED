To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question involves multiplying two terms from the brackets \((x-8)(x-2)\), specifically the \(x\) from the first bracket and the \(-2\) from the second bracket. The correct calculation is \(x \times -2 = -2x\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to identify what James should get when he multiplies the two terms indicated by the arrows, which are \(x\) and \(-2\). The correct answer is \(-2x\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be not applying the negative sign correctly or misunderstanding the operation. For example, students might forget to multiply by \(-2\) or might add instead of multiply.

## 3: Analyzing Option Choices
- A: \(x + 2\) suggests an addition error.
- B: \(-2x\) is the correct answer.
- C: \(x - 2\) suggests a subtraction error.
- D: \(+2x\) suggests a sign error, not applying the negative.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level

### below_basic:
At this level, students struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might not understand how to multiply terms with variables and constants or might confuse operations.
- A: \(20\%\) (incorrectly adding)
- B: \(40\%\) (correct, but this could be a guess)
- C: \(20\%\) (incorrectly subtracting)
- D: \(20\%\) (sign error)

### basic:
Students at this level have a basic understanding but may still make simple errors.
- A: \(10\%\)
- B: \(60\%\)
- C: \(15\%\)
- D: \(15\%\)

### proficient:
Proficient students understand algebraic operations but might occasionally make careless mistakes.
- A: \(5\%\)
- B: \(80\%\)
- C: \(5\%\)
- D: \(10\%\)

### advanced:
Advanced students have a strong grasp of algebra and are less likely to make errors.
- A: \(2\%\)
- B: \(90\%\)
- C: \(2\%\)
- D: \(6\%\)

## 5: Conclusion
Given the analysis, the predicted percentages for each ability level are as follows:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=2% D=6%
