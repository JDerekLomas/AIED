## Step 1: Understand the question and the common misconception
The question presents two angles around a point labeled as \(2y\) and \(y\). The task is to find the size of angle \(y\). A common misconception related to angles around a point is that students might forget that angles around a point add up to \(360^\circ\), or they might confuse this with angles on a straight line, which add up to \(180^\circ\).

## 2: Identify the correct method to solve the problem
To solve for \(y\), we use the fact that angles around a point add up to \(360^\circ\). Therefore, \(2y + y = 360^\circ\), which simplifies to \(3y = 360^\circ\). Solving for \(y\) gives \(y = 120^\circ\).

## 3: Analyze the potential for misconceptions
The potential misconceptions here include:
- Forgetting that angles around a point sum to \(360^\circ\) and instead using \(180^\circ\), which would lead to \(2y + y = 180^\circ\) or \(3y = 180^\circ\), resulting in \(y = 60^\circ\). This isn't an option, but it indicates a possible misunderstanding.
- Confusing the relationship between angles around a point and other angle relationships.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not understand that angles around a point add up to \(360^\circ\) or might not be able to solve the simple equation. They might choose \(180^\circ\) (A) because it's a common sum for angles on a line, or they might not know what to do, leading to a higher percentage choosing D) Not enough information.

- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic geometry but might struggle with the equation or the concept. They might incorrectly apply the \(180^\circ\) rule (A) or choose an answer that seems reasonable without calculation.

- **Proficient:** These students understand the \(360^\circ\) rule and can solve the equation. However, they might be tempted by simple or familiar numbers. The correct answer, \(120^\circ\) (B), should be appealing as it's a straightforward calculation.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are likely to solve the problem correctly and quickly, choosing \(120^\circ\) (B).

## 5: Assign percentages
Given the above analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (misapplication of \(180^\circ\)), B=20% (might get it right by chance or simple calculation), C=10% (unlikely but could confuse with a right angle), D=30% (not understanding the concept or question).
- **Basic:** A=30%, B=50%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=95%, C=3%, D=2%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=30% B=50% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
