To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question requires students to understand that if Sarah shares her apples into 6 equal groups and there is one apple left over, then the total number of apples she has must be one more than a multiple of 6. This can be represented as \(6n + 1\), where \(n\) is an integer.

## Step 1: Analyze Option A
Option A is \(66\). To see if this fits the \(6n + 1\) pattern, we calculate \(66 - 1 = 65\). Since \(65 \div 6 = 10.833\), \(66\) does not fit the pattern because \(65\) is not a multiple of \(6\).

## 2: Analyze Option B
Option B is \(30\). If we subtract \(1\), we get \(29\), and \(29 \div 6 = 4.833\), which means \(30\) does not fit the \(6n + 1\) pattern.

## 3: Analyze Option C
Option C is \(35\). Subtracting \(1\) gives \(34\), and \(34 \div 6 = 5.667\), so \(35\) does not fit the pattern.

## 4: Analyze Option D
Option D is \(43\). Subtracting \(1\) gives \(42\), and \(42 \div 6 = 7\), which means \(43\) fits the \(6n + 1\) pattern perfectly because \(42\) is a multiple of \(6\).

## 5: Consider Student Understanding
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of division and remainders or might not be able to apply it correctly. They might choose options based on simple arithmetic errors or misunderstandings. Given the simplicity of the numbers, some might incorrectly choose A or B due to not fully grasping the concept.
- **Basic**: Students here should have a basic understanding of division and could potentially apply it, but might make careless errors. They might be tempted by options that seem "right" but don't fit the \(6n + 1\) rule.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily recognize that the correct answer must fit the \(6n + 1\) pattern and be able to eliminate incorrect options. They are likely to choose D.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only understand the concept but also be able to apply it quickly and accurately. They would likely choose D without hesitation.

## 6: Predict Percentages
Given the question's clarity and the straightforward nature of applying the \(6n + 1\) rule:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (simple, large number), B=20% (small, divisible by 5), C=30% (seems plausible), D=30% (fits a pattern they might not fully understand).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=10%, C=20%, D=60% (as they start to grasp the concept).
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=10%, D=80% (clear understanding of the concept).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=5%, D=95% (very confident in their understanding).

The best answer is D.
