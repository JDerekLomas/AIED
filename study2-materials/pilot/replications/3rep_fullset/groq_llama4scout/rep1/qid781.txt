To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about the order of rotational symmetry of the given shape, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding related to rotational symmetry.

## Step 1: Understanding Rotational Symmetry
Rotational symmetry refers to the number of times a shape can be rotated by a certain angle and still look the same. The order of rotational symmetry is the number of positions in which the shape looks the same during a full rotation (360 degrees).

## 2: Analyzing the Shape
Although the specific shape is not provided in the query, we can infer that discussing its rotational symmetry requires identifying how many times it can be rotated to match itself within 360 degrees.

## 3: Common Misconceptions and Understanding
- A shape with no rotational symmetry (or only rotational symmetry of 0) would not look the same after any rotation, which is rare for simple geometric shapes.
- A shape with rotational symmetry of 1 looks the same only after a full 360-degree rotation, essentially meaning it has no symmetry other than itself.
- A shape with rotational symmetry of 2 looks the same after a 180-degree rotation.
- A shape with rotational symmetry of 4 looks the same after 90, 180, 270, and 360-degree rotations.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
Without the visual of the shape, let's assume a common shape that could be discussed: a square. A square has rotational symmetry of 4 because it looks the same after rotations of 90, 180, 270, and 360 degrees.

## 5: Ability Levels and Predictions
- **Below Basic:** Students might not understand rotational symmetry or may confuse it with line symmetry. They might choose A (0) if they think it has no symmetry or B (1) if they only consider it looking the same at 360 degrees.
- **Basic:** Students at this level may recognize simple symmetries. If the shape is a square, they might correctly choose D (4) but could be tempted by C (2) if they confuse it with line symmetry or another property.
- **Proficient:** These students should understand rotational symmetry well. They'd likely choose the correct option based on the shape's properties. For a square, this would be D (4).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level would not only understand but also be able to apply and explain their understanding. They would correctly identify the rotational symmetry of a shape like a square as D (4).

## 6: Specific Predictions
Assuming the shape is a square (rotational symmetry of 4):
- **Below Basic:** A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic:** A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60%
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=20% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
