To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( \frac{5}{12}-\frac{1}{6}= \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to subtract two fractions: \( \frac{5}{12}-\frac{1}{6} \). To perform this operation, students need to find a common denominator, which in this case is 12. The second fraction becomes \( \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{2}{2} = \frac{2}{12} \). Then, the subtraction is \( \frac{5}{12} - \frac{2}{12} = \frac{3}{12} \).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not finding a common denominator or incorrectly performing the subtraction. Another potential error could be simplifying or not simplifying the fractions correctly.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( \frac{7}{12} \) suggests an incorrect addition instead of subtraction.
- Option B: \( \frac{3}{12} \) is the correct answer.
- Option C: \( \frac{4}{6} \) suggests a miscalculation or incorrect simplification; it equals \( \frac{8}{12} \), which is not relevant to the calculation but could be a confusion.
- Option D: \( \frac{4}{12} \) suggests a calculation error.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with finding a common denominator and performing the subtraction. They might incorrectly add or subtract numerators and denominators. Option A (\( \frac{7}{12} \)) could appeal due to incorrect addition. Option D (\( \frac{4}{12} \)) could also be chosen due to simple subtraction errors without finding a common denominator. 
  - Below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%

- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to get the common denominator right but could still make calculation errors. Option B (\( \frac{3}{12} \)) should be more commonly chosen, but errors leading to A or D are still possible.
  - Basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept well and are likely to perform the calculation correctly. However, some might still choose incorrect options due to oversight or slight miscalculation. The correct answer, B, should be predominantly chosen.
  - Proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and are less likely to make basic errors. The correct answer should be nearly universally chosen.
  - Advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
