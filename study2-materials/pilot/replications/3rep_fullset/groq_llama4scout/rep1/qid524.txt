To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question.

The equation given is \(x + y = 20\). This is a straightforward linear equation. To solve it or to check which pair of numbers fits, one simply needs to substitute the values of \(x\) and \(y\) from each option into the equation and see if the equation holds true.

## Step-by-step analysis of options:
- Option A: \(x = 10, y = 2\). Substituting these into the equation gives \(10 + 2 = 12\), which does not equal 20.
- Option B: \(x = 10, y = -2\). Substituting these into the equation gives \(10 + (-2) = 8\), which does not equal 20.
- Option C: \(x = 8, y = 12\). Substituting these into the equation gives \(8 + 12 = 20\), which equals 20.
- Option D: \(x = -8, y = 12\). Substituting these into the equation gives \(-8 + 12 = 4\), which does not equal 20.

## Analysis by ability level:

### below_basic:
Students at this level might struggle with basic substitution and addition. They might not even attempt to substitute or might do so incorrectly.
- A: 30% (guessing or incorrect substitution)
- B: 20% (similar reasoning)
- C: 40% (correct substitution and calculation, or luck)
- D: 10% (incorrect)

### basic:
Students at this level can handle basic equations but might make careless mistakes.
- A: 20% (mistake in calculation)
- B: 15% (similar)
- C: 60% (correct calculation)
- D: 5% (clear mistake)

### proficient:
Students at this level are comfortable with equations and can solve them accurately.
- A: 5% (careless mistake)
- B: 5% (careless mistake)
- C: 85% (accurate calculation)
- D: 5% (unlikely but possible mistake)

### advanced:
Students at this level can not only solve equations accurately but also understand the implications of their solutions.
- A: 0% (unlikely mistake)
- B: 0% (unlikely mistake)
- C: 95% (easy and accurate calculation)
- D: 5% (extremely unlikely, but let's assume a small chance for overconfidence)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
