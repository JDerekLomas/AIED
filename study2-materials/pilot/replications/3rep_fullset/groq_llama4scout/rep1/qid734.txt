## Step 1: Understand the concept of rotational symmetry order
Rotational symmetry order refers to the number of times a shape looks the same when it is rotated by 360 degrees. A shape has rotational symmetry order 2 if it looks the same after being rotated by 180 degrees.

## 2: Analyze the shapes given
- A rectangle has rotational symmetry order 2 because it looks the same after a 180-degree rotation.
- A square has rotational symmetry order 4 because it looks the same after rotations of 90, 180, 270, and 360 degrees.
- A trapezium generally does not have rotational symmetry of order 2, except for specific types like an isosceles trapezium, but it's not a common property associated with all trapeziums.
- A hexagon can have rotational symmetry order 6 (for a regular hexagon), but not necessarily order 2 specifically without more context.

## 3: Consider common misconceptions and student understanding
Students often confuse rotational symmetry with line symmetry. A common error might be to choose a shape based on its familiarity with symmetry properties rather than specifically rotational symmetry of order 2.

## 4: Evaluate the difficulty of the question for different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand the concept of rotational symmetry and may choose based on visual familiarity rather than understanding of symmetry properties. They might incorrectly choose B (Square) because it's a familiar shape with symmetry, or C (Trapezium) if they mistakenly think it has rotational symmetry.
- **Basic**: Students here might have a basic understanding of symmetry but could still be prone to errors, especially if they confuse types of symmetry. They might lean towards A (Rectangle) if they recall it has rotational symmetry, but could also consider B (Square) as it obviously has symmetry.
- **Proficient**: These students should understand rotational symmetry and be able to identify that a rectangle (A) specifically has rotational symmetry order 2. They might still consider B (Square) because it also has rotational symmetry, but should recognize it's order 4.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to not only understand the concept but also apply it accurately. They should quickly identify A (Rectangle) as having rotational symmetry order 2 and dismiss other options based on their symmetry properties.

## 5: Predict student responses
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (some understanding of rectangle's properties), B=30% (familiarity with square), C=20% (misconception about trapezium), D=10% (less familiar with hexagon's properties).
- **Basic**: A=60% (recognize rectangle), B=25% (square is a safe choice), C=10% (trapezium), D=5% (hexagon).
- **Proficient**: A=80% (accurately identify rectangle), B=15% (recognize but distinguish from order 2), C=3% (rarely choose trapezium), D=2% (unlikely to choose hexagon).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (clear understanding), B=4% (unlikely mistake), C=1% (very rare error), D=0% (accurately dismiss hexagon).

## 6: Convert predictions into the required format
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
- basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
- proficient: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
- advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
