To approach this question, let's first understand the task: we need to rearrange the equation \( F = r \omega^{2} \) to solve for \( \omega \). This involves basic algebraic manipulation.

## Step 1: Identify the Correct Algebraic Manipulation
The equation given is \( F = r \omega^{2} \). To solve for \( \omega \), we first divide both sides by \( r \) to get \( \frac{F}{r} = \omega^{2} \). Then, we take the square root of both sides to solve for \( \omega \), which gives \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{F}{r}} \).

## 2: Compare with Given Options
Comparing our solution \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{F}{r}} \) with the provided options:
- A: \( \omega = r F^{2} \) is incorrect because it doesn't correctly represent the relationship after rearranging the equation.
- B: \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{F}{r}} \) matches our solution.
- C: \( \omega = \sqrt{r F} \) is incorrect because it suggests a multiplication relationship under the square root.
- D: \( \omega = \frac{\sqrt{F}}{r} \) is also incorrect because it incorrectly places \( r \) in the denominator outside the square root.

## 3: Analyze Potential Misconceptions and Difficulty Levels
- A common misconception might involve incorrectly handling the exponent or misplacing the terms during rearrangement.
- The question seems straightforward, but students might struggle if they are not confident in their algebraic manipulations, especially if they incorrectly apply operations to both sides of the equation.

## 4: Predict Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not even attempt algebraic rearrangement correctly or might confuse operations. They are more likely to choose an obviously incorrect option like A or C, with A being a plausible incorrect choice due to misapplication of exponent rules, so A=40%, B=20%, C=30%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might struggle with the sequence of operations or remembering to take the square root. They might lean towards B but could be tempted by C or D due to not fully understanding the algebraic steps, so A=10%, B=60%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand algebra well and should easily solve for \( \omega \), making B the most likely correct choice. There might be some confusion leading to D, but it's less likely, so A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of algebra and should not make mistakes in rearranging the equation. Thus, they should predominantly choose B, with very few opting for incorrect answers, so A=0%, B=90%, C=5%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
