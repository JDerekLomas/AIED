## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question provides three vertices of a rectangle and asks for the coordinates of the fourth vertex. The given vertices are \((0,3),(4,-1),(2,-3)\).

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
A common misconception in coordinate geometry is not understanding how to apply properties of specific shapes, such as rectangles, to find missing points. For a rectangle, opposite sides are equal in length and parallel.

## 3: Analyzing the Given Vertices
To find the fourth vertex, we can use the fact that the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of the diagonal formed by two given vertices should be the same as the midpoint of the diagonal formed by the other two vertices (the one we're trying to find and the remaining given vertex).

## 4: Calculating Midpoints
Let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal between \((0,3)\) and \((2,-3)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left(\frac{0+2}{2}, \frac{3+(-3)}{2}\right) = (1, 0)
\]

And the midpoint of the diagonal between \((4,-1)\) and the unknown vertex \((x, y)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left(\frac{4+x}{2}, \frac{-1+y}{2}\right)
\]

These midpoints should be equal:
\[
(1, 0) = \left(\frac{4+x}{2}, \frac{-1+y}{2}\right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
1 = \frac{4+x}{2} \text{ and } 0 = \frac{-1+y}{2}
\]
Solving these:
\[
2 = 4 + x \Rightarrow x = -2
\]
\[
0 = -1 + y \Rightarrow y = 1
\]
So, the fourth vertex is \((-2, 1)\).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with coordinate geometry and properties of shapes. They might not correctly apply the midpoint formula or might not understand the properties of a rectangle. Given the straightforward nature of calculating the midpoint and applying rectangle properties, but considering potential difficulties, we might expect:
  - A=10% (random guess)
  - B=20% (guessing based on given numbers)
  - C=60% (correct calculation or intuition)
  - D=10% (another random guess)

- **Basic:** Students here have a better grasp but may still make careless mistakes. They should be able to apply basic formulas and understand simple geometric properties. However, the ease of this question might lead to:
  - A=5%
  - B=5%
  - C=80%
  - D=10%

- **Proficient:** These students are expected to confidently solve problems like this. Given the straightforward calculation:
  - A=2%
  - B=2%
  - C=90%
  - D=6%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level should quickly and accurately solve the problem without error:
  - A=1%
  - B=1%
  - C=95%
  - D=3%
