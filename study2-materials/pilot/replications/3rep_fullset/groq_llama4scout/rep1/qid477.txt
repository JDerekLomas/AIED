To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The expression given is \((x+4)(x-1)\). The correct expansion of this expression is:
\[
(x+4)(x-1) = x^2 - x + 4x - 4 = x^2 + 3x - 4
\]
However, this exact answer isn't provided, so we look for the closest or the one that reflects a correct understanding.

## Step 1: Identify the Correct Expansion
The correct expansion is \(x^2 + 3x - 4\), which directly matches none of the provided options but can guide us on what a correct answer looks like.

## 2: Analyze Each Option
- A: \(x^{2}-x+4x+3 = x^2 + 3x + 3\)
- B: \(x^{2}+x+4x-3 = x^2 + 5x - 3\)
- C: \(x^{2}-x-4x+4 = x^2 - 5x + 4\)
- D: \(x^{2}-x+4x-4 = x^2 + 3x - 4\)

## 3: Match with Correct Concept
Option D directly matches the correct expansion \(x^2 + 3x - 4\), which comes from applying the FOIL method correctly: First, Outer, Inner, Last.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They may incorrectly add or subtract terms. Options A, B, and C reflect common misconceptions or simple arithmetic errors. Given the simplicity of the question, even students below the basic level might be able to eliminate some obviously incorrect answers, but they might still struggle to identify the correct one due to lack of understanding of the FOIL method. However, D seems straightforward enough that some might stumble upon it.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding and might apply the FOIL method but could make careless errors. They are more likely to recognize the correct form but might be tempted by options that look plausible due to simple mistakes.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to consistently apply the FOIL method correctly and thus should identify D as the correct answer with high accuracy.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can quickly and accurately expand expressions. They are highly likely to choose D.

## 5: Estimate Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (simple mistake, could happen), B=20% (another mistake), C=20% (common error), D=40% (might stumble upon correct by chance or simple understanding).
- **Basic**: A=15% (careless mistake), B=15% (another error), C=10% (less likely but possible), D=60% (should recognize correct expansion).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (unlikely), B=5% (unlikely), C=5% (unlikely), D=85% (accurately apply FOIL).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (no chance), B=0% (no chance), C=0% (no chance), D=100% (certain).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=10% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
