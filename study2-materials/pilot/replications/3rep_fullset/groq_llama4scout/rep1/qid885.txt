## Step 1: Understand the concept of rotational symmetry order
Rotational symmetry order refers to the number of times a shape can be rotated by a certain angle (usually less than 360 degrees) and still look the same as the original shape. For a shape to have rotational symmetry order 4, it must look the same after being rotated by 90 degrees (360/4 = 90 degrees).

## 2: Analyze each option for rotational symmetry order 4
- A: Rectangle - A rectangle has rotational symmetry order 2 because it looks the same after being rotated by 180 degrees.
- B: Square - A square has rotational symmetry order 4 because it looks the same after being rotated by 90 degrees.
- C: Trapezium - A trapezium generally does not have rotational symmetry order 4; it might have order 1 (no rotational symmetry) or 2 in specific cases, but not 4.
- D: Hexagon - A regular hexagon has rotational symmetry order 6, not 4.

## 3: Consider common misconceptions and student understanding
Students often confuse rotational symmetry with line symmetry or misunderstand the order of rotational symmetry. However, the question is specific and straightforward, making it less likely for students to confuse it with other types of symmetry. The key here is recognizing which shapes have rotational symmetry order 4.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle to understand or recall what rotational symmetry means, let alone its order. They might randomly select or choose based on familiar shapes.
- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding of shapes and symmetry but might not fully grasp the concept of rotational symmetry order. They are likely to recognize the square as having a special kind of symmetry.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of rotational symmetry and its order. They should easily identify the square as having rotational symmetry order 4.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also apply it accurately to various shapes. They will quickly and correctly identify the square.

## 5: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (guessing), B=40% (recognizing square), C=15%, D=15%.
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=70% (starting to understand symmetry), C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=90%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=95%, C=2%, D=3%.

## 6: Convert estimates into the required format
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2% D=3%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2% D=3%
