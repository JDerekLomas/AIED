To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 427 \times 6= \), let's analyze the question and the options provided.

The question requires the calculation of \( 427 \times 6 \). To solve this, one can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition, breaking down 427 into easier-to-multiply components.

## Step 1: Breaking down 427 for easier multiplication
427 can be broken down into 400, 20, and 7. So, \( 427 \times 6 = (400 + 20 + 7) \times 6 \).

## 2: Applying the distributive property
Using the distributive property, we get \( 400 \times 6 + 20 \times 6 + 7 \times 6 \).

## 3: Calculating each part
- \( 400 \times 6 = 2400 \)
- \( 20 \times 6 = 120 \)
- \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \)

## 4: Adding the parts together
So, \( 427 \times 6 = 2400 + 120 + 42 \).

## 5: Evaluating the options
- A: \( 240+120+42 \) - This is incorrect because it doesn't correctly multiply 400 by 6.
- B: \( 2400+120+47 \) - This is incorrect because \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \), not 47.
- C: \( 400+20+7 \) - This option simply lists the components of 427 without multiplying by 6, so it's clearly incorrect.
- D: \( 2400+120+42 \) - This matches our calculation.

## 6: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with multiplication and the concept of breaking down numbers. They might choose an option that seems to reflect a misunderstanding of multiplication or addition. Option C seems like a naive or incorrect approach that doesn't involve calculation, so it might appeal to some. Option A could be chosen by those who misunderstand the multiplication. \( A=30\% B=10\% C=40\% D=20\% \)
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of multiplication but might make calculation errors. They are more likely to recognize the correct calculation but might be tempted by options that reflect common misconceptions. \( A=20\% B=15\% C=20\% D=45\% \)
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid understanding of multiplication and can apply the distributive property accurately. They are less likely to be swayed by incorrect options. \( A=5\% B=5\% C=5\% D=85\% \)
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the concepts but can also solve problems efficiently. They will likely choose the correct option without hesitation. \( A=0\% B=0\% C=0\% D=100\% \)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=20% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
