To predict how students at different ability levels would respond to this question, let's analyze the question itself and the common misconceptions or knowledge related to the sum of interior angles in polygons.

The formula to calculate the sum of interior angles in a polygon is \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a hexagon, which has 6 sides, the calculation would be \((6-2) \times 180^\circ = 4 \times 180^\circ = 720^\circ\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception and Basic Knowledge
A common misconception might be that the sum of angles in any polygon is \(360^\circ\), which is actually the sum of angles around a point or in a quadrilateral that forms a complete rotation. However, for a hexagon, students need to recall the formula or know that a hexagon's interior angles sum to \(720^\circ\).

## 2: Analyzing Option D - Not Enough Information
Option D, "Not enough information to work it out," might attract students who are unsure about the formula or think that the shape being irregular affects the total sum of its interior angles. However, the sum of interior angles in any polygon is determined solely by the number of its sides, not by its regularity.

## 3: Breaking Down by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not recall the formula or might think the shape's irregularity affects the angle sum. They might confuse the polygon with a circle or a quadrilateral. So, they could be tempted by \(360^\circ\) (A) or think there's not enough information (D).
- **Basic:** Basic level students should have some recollection of polygon properties but might not confidently apply the formula. They might guess or mistakenly apply known formulas.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are likely to know the formula and apply it correctly, leading them to choose \(720^\circ\) (C).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will not only know the formula but also understand its implications and exceptions, confidently choosing \(720^\circ\).

## 4: Making Predictions
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (misconception about \(360^\circ\)), B=10% (random guess), C=20% (somehow knows or guesses the correct answer), D=40% (thinks it's unsure or applies wrong logic).
- **Basic:** A=20%, B=15%, C=50% (correct application or recall), D=15%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=100%, D=0%.

The best answer is B. 
Given the strict format requirement:

below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
