## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks for the size of angle \( p \) in a given quadrilateral, with an image provided that is not drawn to scale. The quadrilateral has some angles labeled.

## 2: Recall relevant geometric principles
In a quadrilateral, the sum of all interior angles is \( 360^{\circ} \). This principle can be used to find missing angles if enough information is provided.

## 3: Analyze the given information
Although the specific angles are not provided in the question text, we can infer that to solve for angle \( p \), one would need to know at least three other angles or have some relationship between the angles.

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and errors
A common misconception might involve thinking that certain types of quadrilaterals (like rectangles or squares) have specific angle measurements, or incorrectly applying properties of triangles or other shapes to quadrilaterals.

## 5: Evaluate the difficulty of the question
Given that the question does not provide specific measurements of the angles but asks for a precise answer, students need to either recognize that the information given (even if not explicitly stated here) is sufficient to solve for \( p \) or understand that it's not possible to determine \( p \) without more information.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic geometry concepts and are likely to guess or choose an answer that seems plausible without calculation, such as \( 90^{\circ} \) or another common angle, but since those options aren't provided, they might lean towards \( 120^{\circ} \) or \( 70^{\circ} \) as these are simple, recognizable angles. \( D \) might be chosen by a few who realize they don't know how to calculate it.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic geometry but might not always apply it correctly. They might recognize that the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is \( 360^{\circ} \) but could struggle if the given angles don't easily add up or subtract to a simple number.
- **Proficient:** These students understand geometric principles well and can apply them. If the diagram or question implicitly provides enough information (e.g., other angles), they should be able to calculate \( p \) accurately. If not, they might select \( D \).
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the principles but can also analyze complex geometric figures. They are likely to solve the problem correctly if the information allows for it.

## 7: Estimate response percentages
Without the explicit diagram or angles, let's assume a generic quadrilateral with one angle being \( 120^{\circ} \) and another \( 70^{\circ} \), and a right angle \( 90^{\circ} \) for simplicity. The fourth angle \( p \) would then be \( 360^{\circ} - 120^{\circ} - 70^{\circ} - 90^{\circ} = 80^{\circ} \), but since \( 80^{\circ} \) isn't an option, let's assess based on provided choices:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic:** A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
- **Proficient:** A=10% B=5% C=60% D=25%
- **Advanced:** A=5% B=0% C=80% D=15%

The best answer is C.
