## Step 1: Understanding the Triangle Inequality Theorem
The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. This theorem is crucial for determining whether a triangle can be constructed with given side lengths.

## 2: Analyzing Tom's Claim
Tom claims that a triangle can be constructed with side lengths \(11 \mathrm{~cm}, 10 \mathrm{~cm},\) and \(2 \mathrm{~cm}\). Let's apply the Triangle Inequality Theorem:
- \(11 + 10 > 2\) is true because \(21 > 2\).
- \(11 + 2 > 10\) is true because \(13 > 10\).
- \(10 + 2 > 11\) is false because \(12 > 11\) is actually true, my mistake, \(12 > 11\).
Correcting the evaluation:
- All conditions are actually met: \(11 + 10 > 2\), \(11 + 2 > 10\), and \(10 + 2 > 11\). So, Tom is correct.

## 3: Analyzing Katie's Claim
Katie claims that a triangle can be constructed with side lengths \(8 \mathrm{~cm}, 5 \mathrm{~cm},\) and \(3 \mathrm{~cm}\). Applying the Triangle Inequality Theorem:
- \(8 + 5 > 3\) is true because \(13 > 3\).
- \(8 + 3 > 5\) is true because \(11 > 5\).
- \(5 + 3 > 8\) is true because \(8 > 8\) is false, my mistake, \(8\) is not greater than \(8\), it's equal. So, \(5 + 3\) is not greater than \(8\), it's equal.
Correcting the evaluation:
- The condition \(5 + 3 > 8\) is not met because \(8\) is not less than \(8\), they are equal. So, Katie is incorrect.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
Given the analysis:
- Tom is correct, and Katie is incorrect.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the theorem or its application. They might incorrectly apply the rules or misunderstand the concept. Thus, they could be more likely to choose incorrect options. Let's assume they have a harder time understanding the theorem, so A=30% (thinking Tom is right but not understanding Katie's case), B=20% (thinking only Katie is right), C=20% (thinking both are right), D=30% (not understanding either).
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of the basics but might make simple errors. They might correctly identify Tom but struggle with Katie or vice versa. So, A=20%, B=20%, C=50% (correctly identifying Tom but possibly misunderstanding Katie), D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the theorem well and can apply it. They should correctly identify Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect. So, A=60%, B=10%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the theorem but can also apply it to complex situations. They should have no issues with this question. Thus, A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=60% B=10% C=20% D=10%
advanced: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
