To approach this question, let's first analyze what is being asked and the nature of each equation given. The task is to identify which of the provided equations has exactly one solution. This requires understanding the conditions under which a quadratic equation has one solution, namely that its discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) must be equal to 0.

## Step 1: Analyze Option A
Option A is \( t^{2} - 9t = 0 \). This equation can be factored as \( t(t - 9) = 0 \), which gives solutions \( t = 0 \) and \( t = 9 \). Therefore, it has two solutions.

## 2: Analyze Option B
Option B is \( t^{2} + 6t + 9 = 0 \). This equation can be factored as \( (t + 3)^2 = 0 \), which means it has exactly one solution, \( t = -3 \).

## 3: Analyze Option C
Option C is \( t^{2} - 6t - 9 = 0 \). To determine the number of solutions, we can calculate the discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(-9) = 36 + 36 = 72 \). Since the discriminant is greater than 0, this equation has two solutions.

## 4: Analyze Option D
Option D is \( t^{2} - 9 = 0 \). This equation can be solved as \( t^2 = 9 \), which gives \( t = 3 \) and \( t = -3 \). Therefore, it has two solutions.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with factoring and solving quadratic equations. They might not correctly identify the number of solutions for each equation. Option B, being a perfect square, might be recognizable to some as having one solution, but the others might be confusing. Guessing might be prevalent. 
  - A: 25% (recognize it has solutions but not necessarily two)
  - B: 30% (some might recognize the perfect square)
  - C: 20% (less likely to recognize it's not one solution)
  - D: 25% (similar to A)

- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp of solving quadratic equations but might still make errors in identifying the number of solutions, especially if they rely on factoring. Option B should be more recognizable as having one solution.
  - A: 10% (unlikely to think it has one solution)
  - B: 50% (should recognize the perfect square)
  - C: 15% (might mistakenly think it's one solution)
  - D: 25% (should know it has two solutions)

- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with solving quadratic equations and understanding conditions for the number of solutions. They should easily identify Option B.
  - A: 5% (know it has two solutions)
  - B: 80% (easily recognize one solution)
  - C: 5% (know it has two solutions)
  - D: 10% (know it has two solutions)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only solve equations easily but also understand the underlying algebraic principles. They should have no trouble identifying Option B and ruling out the others.
  - A: 0% (clearly two solutions)
  - B: 95% (clearly one solution)
  - C: 0% (clearly two solutions)
  - D: 5% (clearly two solutions)

Given the analysis, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=50% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
