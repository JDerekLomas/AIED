To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \(9 \times \sqrt{3}\), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or correct understanding that students might have.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to simplify \(9 \times \sqrt{3}\) if possible. The correct simplification involves recognizing that \(9 = 3^2\), and thus \(9 \times \sqrt{3} = 3^2 \times 3^{1/2} = 3^{2 + 1/2} = 3^{5/2} = (3^2)^{1/2} \times 3^{1/2} = 3\sqrt{3}\) or directly \(9\sqrt{3}\) which is already in a simplified form but can be expressed as \(\sqrt{9^2 \times 3} = \sqrt{81 \times 3} = \sqrt{243}\).

## 2: Analyzing Options
- A: \(\sqrt{12}\) is incorrect because \(\sqrt{12} = \sqrt{4 \times 3} = 2\sqrt{3}\), and \(9 \times \sqrt{3} \neq 2\sqrt{3}\).
- B: \(\sqrt{27}\) is incorrect because \(\sqrt{27} = \sqrt{9 \times 3} = 3\sqrt{3}\), and \(9 \times \sqrt{3} = 9\sqrt{3} \neq 3\sqrt{3}\).
- C: \(9\sqrt{3}\) is the correct expression as it directly results from multiplying \(9\) by \(\sqrt{3}\) without further simplification needed or possible in a more reduced radical form.
- D: Cannot be simplified is incorrect because \(9\sqrt{3}\) is already a simplified form.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and properties of radicals. They might incorrectly simplify or not simplify at all. Option C (\(9\sqrt{3}\)) seems straightforward but might not be immediately obvious to those who do not understand that \(9\sqrt{3}\) is indeed a simplified form. A common mistake could be trying to force it into a different form (A or B), or thinking it can't be simplified (D). 
  - Below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra and radicals. They should recognize \(9\sqrt{3}\) as a simplified form but might be tempted by options that seem to simplify further or incorrectly apply rules. 
  - Basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%

- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the properties of radicals and can apply them correctly. They should easily identify \(9\sqrt{3}\) as the correct and simplified form.
  - Proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%

- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the properties of radicals but can also manipulate expressions efficiently. They should have no issue identifying \(9\sqrt{3}\) as the correct answer and might see through common misconceptions.
  - Advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
