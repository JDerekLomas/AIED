## Step 1: Understand the question
The question provides a graph representing the function $y = \frac{4}{x}$ and asks for the value of $y$ when $x = -1$. The graph shows two curves, one in the positive $x$, positive $y$ quadrant and the other in the negative $x$, negative $y$ quadrant.

## 2: Identify key features of the function
The function $y = \frac{4}{x}$ has two asymptotes: a vertical asymptote at $x = 0$ and a horizontal asymptote at $y = 0$. For $x < 0$, $y$ is negative, and for $x > 0$, $y$ is positive.

## 3: Analyze the graph
The graph provided shows that when $x = -1$, the corresponding $y$ value on the curve in the negative $x$, negative $y$ quadrant is $-4$. This can also be determined algebraically by substituting $x = -1$ into the equation $y = \frac{4}{x}$, which yields $y = \frac{4}{-1} = -4$.

## 4: Consider common misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect handling of negative signs or misunderstanding the function's behavior in different quadrants. However, given the graph and the straightforward nature of substituting $x = -1$ into $y = \frac{4}{x}$, the question seems to test direct application of the function rather than a deep-seated misconception about asymptotes or function behavior.

## 5: Predict student responses by ability level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with substituting into the formula or reading the graph. They might not accurately read the graph or calculate $y = \frac{4}{-1}$. Expect a higher chance of incorrect answers, potentially guessing or misinterpreting the graph. $A=20\%$, $B=60\%$, $C=10\%$, $D=10\%$.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding and can likely substitute into the equation but might make careless mistakes. They should be able to read the graph with some accuracy. $A=5\%$, $B=80\%$, $C=5\%$, $D=10\%$.
- **Proficient:** These students understand the function and can apply it accurately. They should easily read the graph and calculate $y$. $A=0\%$, $B=95\%$, $C=0\%$, $D=5\%$.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding of the function and its graph. They will accurately calculate $y$ and understand the function's behavior. $A=0\%$, $B=99\%$, $C=0\%$, $D=1\%$.

## 6: Format the prediction
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
- basic: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
- proficient: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=99% C=0% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=99% C=0% D=1%
