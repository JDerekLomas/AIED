To approach this question, let's first solve the inequality \(20 \geq 8m\) to understand the range of \(m\).

## Step 1: Solve the inequality
To solve \(20 \geq 8m\), we divide both sides by 8, remembering that this operation does not change the direction of the inequality since 8 is positive.
\[ \frac{20}{8} \geq m \]
\[ 2.5 \geq m \]

## 2: Interpret the solutions for Tom and Katie
Tom says \(m\) could be \(2.5\), and Katie says \(m\) could be \(3\). From the inequality \(2.5 \geq m\), we see that:
- \(m = 2.5\) satisfies the inequality because \(2.5 \geq 2.5\) is true.
- \(m = 3\) does not satisfy the inequality because \(2.5 \geq 3\) is false.

## 3: Determine the correctness of Tom and Katie's statements
- Tom is correct because \(2.5\) is a valid solution.
- Katie is incorrect because \(3\) is not a valid solution.

## 4: Analyze the potential for student errors
This question tests the understanding of inequalities and the ability to substitute values into them. A common misconception could be not dividing by 8 correctly or misunderstanding the direction of the inequality. However, given the straightforward nature of this specific question and the values provided (2.5 and 3), most students should be able to see that:
- 2.5 divided by 8 or directly comparing 2.5 to the inequality solution works out.
- 3 is clearly greater than 2.5, thus not satisfying the inequality.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and understanding of inequalities. They might incorrectly solve the inequality or not understand how to check Tom and Katie's claims. Expect a high percentage of incorrect responses, potentially spread across A, B, and D, with a lack of understanding that would lead to guessing.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple errors. They should be able to solve the inequality but might not carefully check Tom and Katie's values. There might be some confusion, leading to incorrect answers, but a significant portion should get it right.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve the inequality and check the values. They are likely to identify Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect, choosing A.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only solve the inequality correctly but also quickly verify Tom and Katie's claims. They are highly likely to choose the correct answer, A.

## 6: Estimate percentages
Given the nature of the question and typical student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (think Tom is right but can't articulate why Katie is wrong), B=20% (think Katie is right), C=10% (both are guessed), D=30% (neither is guessed).
- **Basic**: A=60%, B=20%, C=5%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
