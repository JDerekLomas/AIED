To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it presents.

The question requires Sunita to buy a soup for £3.19 and a coffee for £1.95, and then calculate the change she should get from £20. The total cost is £3.19 + £1.95 = £5.14. Therefore, the change she should get is £20 - £5.14 = £14.86.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task involves a simple subtraction and addition with decimals, which is fundamental. However, the context of a café with various items might distract some students, but the numbers provided are straightforward.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions or Errors
A common error could be in adding or subtracting the decimals incorrectly. Another potential issue could be in understanding what "change" means - the amount left over after paying for something. However, given the numbers are not extremely large or complicated, and the calculation is relatively straightforward (£3.19 + £1.95 = £5.14, then £20 - £5.14 = £14.86), the main challenge might be in executing the calculation accurately.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A (£5.14) might be chosen by students who only calculate the total cost of the items and don't proceed to find the change.
- Option B (£15.86) could result from incorrect subtraction or calculation.
- Option C (£14.86) is the correct answer.
- Option D (£14.96) might result from a miscalculation, possibly adding or subtracting incorrectly.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations, including decimal calculations. They might choose A because they only add the costs and stop, or make a significant error leading to B or D. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, particularly A and B. So, below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundation but might still make calculation errors. They are more likely to attempt the subtraction but could still get it wrong. Expect C to be the most popular but with a notable percentage for A. So, basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%.
- **Proficient:** These students are generally good with calculations. They might still consider A as an option if they're not careful about the question asked (total cost vs. change), but most should get C correct. So, proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly likely to understand the question and calculate correctly. The incorrect options might attract very few, if any, of these students. So, advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
