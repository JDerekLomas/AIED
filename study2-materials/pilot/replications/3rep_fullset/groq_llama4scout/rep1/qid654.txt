To predict how students at different ability levels might respond to this question, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or difficulties students might encounter.

The question requires simplifying the expression \( \frac{m^{2}-2 m-3}{m-3} \). This involves factoring the numerator and then simplifying if possible.

## Step 1: Factor the numerator
The numerator can be factored as \( m^{2} - 2m - 3 = (m - 3)(m + 1) \). So, the expression becomes \( \frac{(m - 3)(m + 1)}{m - 3} \).

## Step 2: Simplify the expression
If \( m \neq 3 \), we can simplify the expression by cancelling out the \( (m - 3) \) from the numerator and the denominator, leaving us with \( m + 1 \).

## 3: Consider common errors or difficulties
A common difficulty or misconception might involve not fully factoring the numerator or not recognizing that \( m - 3 \) can be cancelled out, leading to incorrect simplifications. Another potential issue is not realizing that the expression simplifies to \( m + 1 \) but rather trying to simplify it incorrectly or concluding it does not simplify due to oversight.

## 4: Analyze the options
- Option A: \( m + 1 \) is the correct simplification.
- Option B: \( m - 2 \) would be an incorrect simplification.
- Option C: \( m - 1 \) would also be incorrect.
- Option D: "Does not simplify" would be incorrect given that the expression can indeed be simplified to \( m + 1 \) for \( m \neq 3 \).

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with factoring and simplifying algebraic expressions. They might not factor the numerator correctly or might not see how to cancel terms, leading to a higher likelihood of choosing incorrect options or "Does not simplify". 
  - A=20% (some might get lucky with correct factoring and cancellation), B=30% (incorrect simplification), C=20% (another incorrect), D=30% (not recognizing simplification).

- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp of basic algebra but might still make careless mistakes. They are more likely to attempt factoring and see the cancellation but might be prone to errors.
  - A=50% (correct approach but might make mistakes), B=20%, C=15%, D=15%.

- **Proficient**: These students have a solid understanding of algebraic manipulations and are less likely to make simple errors. They should easily factor and simplify.
  - A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can handle more complex algebra with ease. They are unlikely to make mistakes with such a straightforward problem.
  - A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%.

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
