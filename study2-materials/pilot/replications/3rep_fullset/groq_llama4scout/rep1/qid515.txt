## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question asks students to determine the vector that describes the translation mapping object \( Q \) onto object \( P \). The coordinates of \( P \) and \( Q \) are given, allowing students to calculate the translation vector.

## 2: Identifying the correct translation vector
To find the correct vector, we need to calculate the difference in x and y coordinates between a point on \( P \) and the corresponding point on \( Q \). For simplicity, let's use the bottom-left vertices: \( P(1, 7) \) and \( Q(4, 2) \). The translation vector \( \vec{T} \) from \( Q \) to \( P \) is given by \( \vec{T} = \left(\begin{array}{c}1 - 4 \\ 7 - 2\end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c}-3 \\ 5\end{array}\right) \).

## 3: Analyzing potential misconceptions and difficulty levels
A common misconception could involve incorrect calculation of the vector or misinterpreting the direction of translation. However, given that the question provides visual aids and specific coordinates, it seems straightforward. The difficulty might arise from calculating the vector correctly, especially for students who are not confident in their coordinate geometry skills.

## 4: Predicting student responses by ability level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with calculating the vector or understanding the concept of translation. They might not accurately identify corresponding points or perform the arithmetic correctly. Given the visual nature of the question, they might be tempted to guess or choose an answer based on incorrect calculations.
- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a basic understanding of vectors and translations but might make simple arithmetic errors. They are more likely to understand the concept but could struggle with precise calculations.
- **Proficient:** These students should be able to accurately calculate the translation vector using the coordinates provided. They understand the concept of translation in coordinate geometry and can apply it correctly.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to not only calculate the vector correctly but also understand the implications of their calculations. They are likely to choose the correct answer with confidence.

## 5: Estimating percentages for each option
Given the correct vector is \( \left(\begin{array}{c}-3 \\ 5\end{array}\right) \), which corresponds to option C:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20% (guessing or simple errors)
- **Basic:** A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5% (mostly get it right but some errors)
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5% (accurately calculate the vector)
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5% (confidently and accurately choose the correct vector)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
