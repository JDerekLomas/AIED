To approach this question, let's analyze the concepts involved and the potential for misconceptions.

The question revolves around the concepts of reflection and rotation in the context of congruent shapes. Congruent shapes are those that have the same size and shape. Reflection and rotation are two types of transformations that can be applied to shapes:

1. **Reflection** involves flipping a shape over a line (the mirror line or axis of reflection). The shape's size and orientation change relative to the line of reflection, but its size remains the same.
2. **Rotation** involves turning a shape around a fixed point (the center of rotation) by a certain angle. The shape's size and orientation change, but its size remains the same.

Both reflection and rotation are isometric transformations, meaning they preserve the size and shape of the figure. Therefore, if you reflect or rotate a shape, the resulting image is congruent to the original shape.

Given this understanding:

- **Tom's statement** that you can reflect a shape and it will still be congruent to the original is correct.
- **Katie's statement** that you can rotate a shape and it will still be congruent to the original is also correct.

The question now is to predict the percentage of students at different ability levels who would choose each option:

### below_basic:
At this level, students might struggle with basic geometric concepts and might not fully understand the implications of transformations on shapes. 
- A=20% (Some might think only reflection works, possibly due to superficial understanding.)
- B=20% (Similarly, some might think only rotation works.)
- C=40% (Students who have some understanding that both transformations preserve congruence might choose this, but with less confidence.)
- D=20% (Some might not understand either concept well.)

### basic:
Students at this level have a foundational understanding of geometry and transformations.
- A=10% (Fewer students would exclusively choose Tom.)
- B=10% (Likewise, fewer would exclusively choose Katie.)
- C=70% (Most would understand that both transformations result in congruent shapes.)
- D=10% (Very few would deny both, given basic understanding.)

### proficient:
Students here have a solid grasp of geometric transformations and congruence.
- A=5% (Very few would mistakenly think only reflection works.)
- B=5% (Similarly, very few would think only rotation works.)
- C=85% (The majority would confidently choose both.)
- D=5% (Almost none would think neither is correct.)

### advanced:
At this level, students not only understand but can also apply and reason about geometric concepts deeply.
- A=0% (None would think only Tom is correct, given their deep understanding.)
- B=0% (None would think only Katie is correct.)
- C=95% (Almost all would correctly identify that both are correct.)
- D=5% (Possibly some very rare misinterpretation, but highly unlikely.)

Therefore, the predictions are:

below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
