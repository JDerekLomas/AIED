## Step 1: Understand the question and the common misconception
The question asks students to expand the expression \(-(2-3p)\). A common misconception in algebra is that when distributing a negative sign, students might forget to change the signs of the terms inside the parentheses.

## 2: Determine the correct answer
To expand \(-(2-3p)\), we distribute the negative sign: \(-2 + 3p\). So, the correct answer is D: \(-2 + 3p\).

## 3: Analyze the potential for errors at different ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand how to distribute a negative sign across terms in parentheses or might not know the basic rules of algebra. They are likely to choose an option that doesn't correctly apply the distribution, potentially A: \(2-3p\) or B: \(-2-3p\), as these reflect a lack of understanding of how to handle the negative sign.

## 4: Consider the Below Basic category predictions
Given the nature of the question, below basic students might choose A because they ignore the negative sign altogether, or B because they distribute the negative sign to the first term but not the second. C: \(2+3p\) suggests adding the terms without distributing the negative, which could also be a mistake but less likely as it implies some form of incorrect operation. D: \(-2+3p\) is the correct answer.

## 5: Analyze the Basic level
Basic level students should have a grasp of simple algebraic manipulations. However, they might still fall into the trap of not correctly distributing the negative sign, potentially choosing A or C due to oversight or misunderstanding.

## 6: Consider the Proficient and Advanced levels
Proficient and advanced students are more likely to correctly distribute the negative sign and choose D: \(-2+3p\). However, even among these groups, there's always a chance of error, though it should be minimal.

## 7: Make predictions for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (ignoring the negative), B=30% (distributing negative to the first term but not changing the second), C=20% (adding without distributing the negative), D=10% (correct).
- **Basic**: A=20%, B=10%, C=15%, D=55%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=2%, C=3%, D=90%.
- **Advanced**: A=1%, B=1%, C=1%, D=97%.

The best answer is D.
