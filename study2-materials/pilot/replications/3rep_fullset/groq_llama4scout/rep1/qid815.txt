To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 20 \% \) of \( \pounds 140= \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to calculate 20% of £140. This is a straightforward percentage calculation.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve confusing the percentage with a direct fraction or miscalculating the percentage of the given amount. For example, some students might calculate \( \frac{20}{100} \times 140 \) but then get confused or make a calculation error.

## 3: Analyzing Option A - \( £ 280 \)
This option suggests doubling the amount, which could be a mistake if a student mistakenly calculates 200% of £140.

## 4: Analyzing Option B - \( £ 20 \)
This seems like a very low percentage of £140, suggesting a possible calculation error where the student significantly underestimates 20% of £140.

## 5: Analyzing Option C - \( £ 120 \)
This option is close to the original amount but subtracts £20, which might suggest a misconception about percentages or a simple subtraction error.

## 6: Analyzing Option D - \( £ 28 \)
This is the correct calculation: \( 20\% \) of \( £140 = 0.20 \times 140 = £28 \).

## 7: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic percentage calculations. They might choose A (thinking it's 200% of £140, but actually, this requires an understanding of scaling), B (underestimating), or C (getting close but making a calculation error). D seems unlikely for many but let's assume 20% get it right.
- **Basic**: Students here should have a grasp of percentages but might still make simple calculation errors. They are more likely to choose D but might be tempted by A or C due to miscalculations. Let's assume 50% choose D.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily calculate 20% of £140 correctly. Let's assume 80% choose D.
- **Advanced**: These students are likely to have a strong understanding of percentages and will easily identify the correct answer. Let's assume 95% choose D.

## 8: Estimating Percentages for Each Option
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (thinking 200%), B=20% (underestimation), C=30% (near miss), D=20% (correct).
- **Basic**: A=20% (miscalculation), B=5% (unlikely), C=25% (error), D=50% (correct).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (occasional error), B=0% (unlikely), C=15% (some errors), D=80% (correct).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (unlikely), B=0% (very unlikely), C=5% (rare error), D=95% (correct).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=5% C=25% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=15% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
