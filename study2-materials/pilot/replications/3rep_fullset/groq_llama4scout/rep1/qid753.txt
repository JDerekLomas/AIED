## Step 1: Understand the question and the concept being tested
The question asks for the gradient of a line given two points it passes through: (1,2) and (0,6). The gradient \(m\) of a line passing through points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \(m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\). This is a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in coordinate geometry.

## 2: Calculate the gradient
To find the gradient, we substitute the given points into the formula: \(m = \frac{6 - 2}{0 - 1} = \frac{4}{-1} = -4\). This means the correct answer is D) \(-4\).

## 3: Consider common misconceptions and errors
A common misconception might involve incorrectly applying the gradient formula or misinterpreting the coordinates. However, given that the points are clearly defined and the formula is straightforward, errors are likely to be minimal among students familiar with the concept.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the formula or changing the signs correctly. They might incorrectly calculate the gradient as \( \frac{2-6}{1-0} = -4 \) (which is correct but let's see their chances of getting it right or wrong on other options). Given their lack of understanding, they might also consider \( -1 \) or \( -1.5 \) as potential answers due to confusion with other formulas or not fully understanding the concept of gradient. Option B seems less likely as it involves a fraction that might not be immediately apparent without calculation.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and are likely to apply the formula correctly, yielding \( -4 \) as the answer. However, some might mistakenly use \( (0,6) \) and \( (1,2) \) in the wrong order or confuse with other linear concepts, potentially leading to A) \( -1 \) or C) \( -1.5 \) if they mistakenly calculate or round.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to consistently apply the gradient formula correctly and understand the concept well. Therefore, they should predominantly choose D) \( -4 \).
- **Advanced**: Similar to proficient students, advanced students should have a strong grasp of the concept and be able to calculate the gradient accurately, leading them to choose D) \( -4 \) with high confidence.

## 5: Estimate percentages for each ability level
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the calculation:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (simple mistake), B=10% (fraction might confuse), C=15% (rounding error or confusion), D=55% (some get it right by chance or correct calculation).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=5%, C=5%, D=80%.
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=2%, C=3%, D=90%.
- **Advanced**: A=2%, B=1%, C=1%, D=96%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=15% D=55%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=3% D=90%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=1% D=96%
