To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential pitfalls for students at different levels.

The expression given is \(p^{2} - 99p\). This is a quadratic expression that can be factorized by taking out a common factor. The question asks students to factorize it, if possible.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to factorize \(p^{2} - 99p\). The most straightforward factorization, if applicable, would involve finding two numbers that multiply to give \(0\) (since there's no constant term) and add to give \(-99\), but more directly, we can see \(p\) is a common factor.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve trying to factor the expression into two binomials with numbers that seem to relate to \(99\), or assuming it doesn't factorize because it doesn't fit a perfect square or simple factorable pattern. However, the expression can be easily factorized by taking \(p\) common: \(p(p - 99)\).

## 3: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \((p+9)(p-9)\), suggests a difference of squares (\(p^2 - 81\)), which is not relevant here since \(99\) is not \(9^2\).

## 4: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \((p+3\sqrt{11})(p-3\sqrt{11})\), implies a difference of squares leading to \(p^2 - 99\), which is close but not exactly what we have.

## 5: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \(p(p-99)\), is a correct factorization by taking out the common factor \(p\).

## 6: Analyzing Option D
Option D, "Does not factorise," would be incorrect because the expression can indeed be factorized.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might be tempted by options that look like they could be correct but don't apply here, such as A or B, because they don't recognize \(p\) as a common factor. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 15\%\), \(C = 40\%\), \(D = 25\%\)
- **Basic:** Students at this level should recognize the common factor \(p\) but might be distracted by more complex factorizations. \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 70\%\), \(D = 10\%\)
- **Proficient:** These students should easily identify \(p(p - 99)\) as the correct factorization. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 85\%\), \(D = 5\%\)
- **Advanced:** Students at this level will quickly and accurately factorize the expression and won't be tempted by incorrect options. \(A = 2\%\), \(B = 2\%\), \(C = 92\%\), \(D = 4\%\)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=92% D=4%
