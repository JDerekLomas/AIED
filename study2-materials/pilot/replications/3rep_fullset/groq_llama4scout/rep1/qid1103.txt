To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The question provides two points, \( (2,-5) \) and \( (-7,1) \), and asks students to apply the distance formula: \( \sqrt{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right)^{2}} \) to find what the first bracket equals. The labels given are \( x_{1}=2 \), \( y_{1}=-5 \), \( x_{2}=-7 \), and \( y_{2}=1 \).

The first bracket in the formula refers to \( \left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right) \). Substituting the given values:

\( \left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right) = (-7 - 2) = -9 \)

So, the first bracket equals \( -9 \), and when squared, it becomes \( (-9)^{2} \) which is \( 81 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for the value of the first bracket.

## 2: Analyzing the options
- Option A: \( (-9)^{2} \)
- Option B: \( (-5)^{2} \)
- Option C: \( (9)^{2} \)
- Option D: \( (5)^{2} \)

## 3: Identifying the correct answer
The correct calculation for the first bracket is \( (-7 - 2) = -9 \), which when squared is \( (-9)^{2} \). This matches Option A.

## 4: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substituting values into the formula or understanding the order of operations. They might incorrectly calculate \( y_{2} - y_{1} \) or \( x_{2} - x_{1} \). Given the simplicity of the subtraction \( -7 - 2 \), but potential confusion with the formula, they might be more likely to choose an option that doesn't require understanding the negative sign's impact when squared. So, A=40%, B=20%, C=30%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are likely to correctly identify \( x_{2} - x_{1} \) but could get confused with the presentation of the answer choices. Thus, A=60%, B=15%, C=20%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the formula and can apply it correctly. They are less likely to make careless mistakes. Hence, A=80%, B=5%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of the concepts and are unlikely to make errors in simple calculations. Therefore, A=95%, B=0%, C=5%, D=0%.

The best answer is A. 

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=5% D=0%
