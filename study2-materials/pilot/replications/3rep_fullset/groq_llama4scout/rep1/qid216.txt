To approach this question, let's first understand what makes two lines parallel in terms of their equations. Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope (gradient) but different y-intercepts.

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's lines
Tom claims that \(y = 2x + 3\) and \(y = 3x + 2\) are parallel. The first line has a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 3, while the second line has a slope of 3 and a y-intercept of 2. Since the slopes are different (2 and 3), Tom's lines are not parallel.

## 2: Analyze Katie's lines
Katie claims that \(y = 2x + 3\) and \(y = 2x - 3\) are parallel. The first line has a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 3, while the second line has a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of -3. Since the slopes are the same (both are 2) but the y-intercepts are different (3 and -3), Katie's lines are indeed parallel.

## 3: Evaluating Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of parallel lines or might confuse the slope and y-intercept. They might think Tom is correct because they misunderstand what makes lines parallel, or they might not recognize that Katie's lines have the same slope. Given the straightforward nature of the question, however, most might still be able to identify that Tom is wrong and Katie is right through basic understanding or trial and error, but errors will be common. Let's predict: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%.
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of linear equations and might recall that parallel lines have the same slope. They might still make errors in applying this rule, especially if they focus too much on the numbers without understanding the concept. Let's predict: A=20% B=50% C=10% D=20%.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand that for lines to be parallel, they must have the same slope but different y-intercepts. They should easily identify that Tom is incorrect because his lines have different slopes, and Katie is correct because her lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts. Let's predict: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the conditions for lines to be parallel but can also quickly analyze the equations. They would immediately see Tom's mistake and Katie's correctness. Let's predict: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=10% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
