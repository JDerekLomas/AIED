To tackle this question, let's analyze the reflection process and what might confuse students at different levels.

## Step 1: Understanding the Reflection
The triangle is reflected in the dashed line \(y = 2\). This means that for any point \((x, y)\), its reflection across \(y = 2\) will have coordinates \((x, 4 - y)\), because the line \(y = 2\) acts as a mirror, and the distance of \(y\) from 2 is mirrored on the other side.

## 2: Identifying Point P and Its Reflection
Point P is at \((2, 2)\). To find its reflection across \(y = 2\), we apply the transformation: the new \(y\)-coordinate is \(4 - 2 = 2\). Thus, the reflection of point P across \(y = 2\) is still \((2, 2)\).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Errors
- A common misconception could be that students might confuse the reflection with a rotation or misapply the formula for reflection across a line not parallel to the axes. However, given \(y = 2\) is horizontal and the point P lies on it, the reflection of P across \(y = 2\) is simply itself for students who understand the concept of reflection across a line.
- For students who are below basic, they might not understand the concept of reflection or might misinterpret the coordinates. 
- Basic students might be able to follow a procedure but could make mistakes if they misunderstand how reflection works or if they incorrectly apply formulas.
- Proficient and advanced students are likely to understand the concept but might still make errors if they're in a rush or if the question's setup is confusing.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
Given point P is on the line of reflection:
- **Below Basic**: These students might not fully grasp the reflection concept, so they could choose any option, but most likely A because it's the original point, or they might not know what to do and pick randomly.
- **Basic**: These students should understand simple reflections. Since P is on \(y=2\), they might correctly choose A, but some could mistakenly think it moves to B, C, or D if they misinterpret the reflection concept.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept of reflection across a line. Given P is on the line \(y = 2\), most should correctly choose A.
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the reflection concept but are also likely to apply it correctly and quickly, so they should also choose A.

## 5: Assigning Percentages
Considering the specifics:
- **Below Basic**: A=60% (as they might stick with what they see or not understand), B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Basic**: A=80% (most get it right), B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=95% (almost all get it right), B=3%, C=1%, D=1%.
- **Advanced**: A=99% (virtually all get it right), B=0.5%, C=0.25%, D=0.25%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%
