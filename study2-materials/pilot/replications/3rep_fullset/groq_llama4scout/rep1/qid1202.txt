To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question presents a simple linear equation:
\[3 - y = 5\]

To solve for \(y\), one needs to isolate \(y\) on one side of the equation. This can be done by subtracting 3 from both sides, which yields:
\[-y = 2\]

Then, multiplying both sides by -1 gives:
\[y = -2\]

The correct answer is \(y = -2\), which corresponds to option B.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The question is designed to test a common misconception or a straightforward algebraic manipulation. The equation given is simple and does not inherently suggest a common misconception like those involving negative numbers or distribution. However, students might struggle with the sign change when solving for \(y\).

## 2: Analyzing Student Responses by Ability Level

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly solve the equation or not solve it at all. A common mistake could be not changing the sign correctly when moving terms around or solving for \(y\). 
  - Option A (\(y = 2\)): This could be a result of incorrectly solving the equation, possibly by adding \(y\) to both sides without properly accounting for the negative sign, or simply guessing.
  - Option B (\(y = -2\)): This is the correct answer, requiring proper algebraic manipulation.
  - Option C (\(y = 8\)) and D (\(y = -8\)): These seem less likely as they would require more significant miscalculations.

- **Basic:** Students at this level are expected to handle simple equations but might still make errors, especially with negative numbers.
  - They are more likely to get the correct answer, B (\(y = -2\)), but some might choose A (\(y = 2\)) due to oversight in handling the negative sign.

- **Proficient:** Students at this level should be able to solve the equation correctly with minimal errors.
  - The majority should choose B (\(y = -2\)), with very few choosing incorrect options.

- **Advanced:** These students are highly likely to solve the equation correctly.
  - Virtually all should choose B (\(y = -2\)).

## 3: Estimating Percentages

Given the simplicity of the equation and the nature of common algebraic mistakes:

- **Below Basic:** A=30% (common mistake), B=40% (correct but struggling), C=10%, D=20% (other incorrect guesses).
- **Basic:** A=20% (still some struggle), B=70% (majority correct), C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=90% (high accuracy), C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=98% (near-perfect accuracy), C=1%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
