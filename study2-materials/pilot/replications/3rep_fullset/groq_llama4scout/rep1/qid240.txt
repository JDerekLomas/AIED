## Step 1: Understand the question and the formula for the area of a trapezium
The area \(A\) of a trapezium is given by the formula \(A = \frac{1}{2}(a + b)h\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the parallel sides, and \(h\) is the height. In this question, \(A = 40 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\), \(b = 2 \mathrm{~cm}\), and \(h = 8 \mathrm{~cm}\). We need to solve for \(a\).

## 2: Substitute the given values into the area formula
Substituting the given values into the formula gives \(40 = \frac{1}{2}(a + 2) \times 8\).

## 3: Solve for \(a\)
Simplifying the equation:
\(40 = \frac{1}{2}(a + 2) \times 8\)
\(40 = 4(a + 2)\)
\(40 = 4a + 8\)
\(40 - 8 = 4a\)
\(32 = 4a\)
\(a = 8\)

## 4: Analyze the potential for student errors
The question tests the application of the trapezium area formula and algebraic manipulation. A common misconception could involve incorrectly applying the formula or making algebraic errors. However, given that the numbers are straightforward and the formula application is direct, the main challenge lies in algebraic manipulation.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the algebraic manipulation or incorrectly apply the formula. They might not solve for \(a\) correctly or choose an answer without calculation. Given the simplicity of the calculation, some might guess or incorrectly calculate, potentially leading to a spread across incorrect options.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand the formula but make mistakes in algebra, such as \(40 = 4(a + 2)\) leading to incorrect solutions. They might choose B, C, or D if their algebraic manipulation is flawed.
- **Proficient**: These students should correctly apply the formula and solve for \(a\), leading them to choose A) \(8 \mathrm{~cm}\) as the correct answer. Errors might arise from miscalculation but should be minimal.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only correctly solve for \(a\) but also do so efficiently. They are less likely to make errors in calculation or formula application.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (some get it by guess or simple trial), B=20%, C=20%, D=40% (errors in calculation or wrong approach)
- **Basic**: A=60% (most get it right with some effort), B=15%, C=10%, D=15% (some algebraic errors)
- **Proficient**: A=85%, B=5%, C=5%, D=5% (mostly correct with some minor errors)
- **Advanced**: A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1% (very few errors)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
