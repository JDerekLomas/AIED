## Step 1: Understand the question and the topic
The question is about a table of values for the equation \(y = x^3\). Given \(y = 27\), we need to determine if \(x\) could be \(3\) or \(-3\). The equation \(y = x^3\) implies that \(x\) is the cube root of \(y\). For \(y = 27\), \(x^3 = 27\), which means \(x = 3\) because \(3^3 = 27\). However, for \(x = -3\), \((-3)^3 = -27\), not \(27\).

## 2: Analyze Tom's statement
Tom says the star could be \(3\). Since \(3^3 = 27\), Tom is correct.

## 3: Analyze Katie's statement
Katie says the star could be \(-3\). Since \((-3)^3 = -27\) and not \(27\), Katie is incorrect.

## 4: Determine the correctness of each option
Given the analysis, only Tom is correct. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Only Tom.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of cubing numbers or might confuse the operations. They might incorrectly think both Tom and Katie could be right or that neither is correct due to a lack of understanding. However, given the simplicity of the question, some might still manage to get it right by chance or basic recall. A=40% (guessing Tom could be right but not understanding why Katie isn't), B=10% (thinking only Katie is right), C=20% (thinking both could be right), D=30% (thinking neither is correct).
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple mistakes. They should recognize Tom's correctness but might be unsure about Katie. A=60%, B=20%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concept well and should easily identify Tom as correct and Katie as incorrect. A=80%, B=10%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and should quickly see that Tom is correct and Katie is not. A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.

## 6: Convert predictions into the required format
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic**: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
- **basic**: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
