To approach this question, let's first analyze the statements made by Jo and Paul and then consider the likely responses of students at different ability levels.

## Step 1: Analyze Jo's Statement
Jo says \( 52 \% = 0.052 \). To assess this, we convert 52% to a decimal: \( 52 \% = 0.52 \). Therefore, Jo's statement is incorrect because \( 52 \% \) is actually equal to \( 0.52 \), not \( 0.052 \).

## 2: Analyze Paul's Statement
Paul says \( 52 \% < \frac{20}{41} \). First, let's convert \( 52 \% \) to a decimal: \( 0.52 \). Then, convert \( \frac{20}{41} \) to a decimal: \( \frac{20}{41} \approx 0.4878 \). Since \( 0.52 > 0.4878 \), Paul's statement is incorrect.

## 3: Determine the Correct Answer
Given that Jo's statement is incorrect and Paul's statement is also incorrect, the correct answer is that neither Jo nor Paul is correct.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with converting percentages to decimals and comparing fractions to decimals. They might incorrectly agree with Jo or Paul due to a lack of understanding of percentages and decimals. However, they are less likely to accurately convert and compare. Expect a high chance of incorrect answers, possibly scattered across A, B, and D, but with a significant proportion choosing D because they see both making claims and might not engage deeply with the mathematics.

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make errors in conversion and comparison. They might recognize Jo's error but struggle with Paul's comparison, potentially leading to a higher percentage choosing D.

- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to correctly convert percentages to decimals and compare fractions to decimals. They should easily identify Jo's mistake and, with some thought, Paul's as well. Thus, they are more likely to choose D.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students will quickly identify both errors and choose D. They have a strong grasp of percentages, decimals, and fractions, making it straightforward to assess both statements.

## 5: Estimate Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (Jo's error is intuitive but wrong), B=20% (similar reasoning), C=10% (unlikely), D=40% (neither is correct, but due to confusion).
- **Basic**: A=25%, B=20%, C=5%, D=50%.
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=5%, C=5%, D=80%.
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=0%, C=0%, D=95%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=5% D=50%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
