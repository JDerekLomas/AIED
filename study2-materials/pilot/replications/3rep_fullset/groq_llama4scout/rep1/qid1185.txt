## Step 1: Understand the task
The task involves predicting the percentage of students at different ability levels (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for completing the square for the given quadratic equation \(y = x^{2} + 8x + 2\).

## 2: Recall the process of completing the square
To complete the square for the equation \(y = x^{2} + 8x + 2\), we take the coefficient of \(x\), which is \(8\), divide it by \(2\) (getting \(4\)), and then square it (getting \(16\)). We then rewrite the equation as \(y = (x^{2} + 8x + 16) + 2 - 16\), which simplifies to \(y = (x + 4)^{2} - 14\).

## 3: Analyze the options with the correct solution in mind
The correct completion of the square is \(y = (x + 4)^{2} - 14\), which corresponds to option A.

## 4: Consider common misconceptions and errors
A common error is not correctly adjusting the constant term when completing the square. For instance, mistakenly adding and subtracting the wrong value or forgetting to adjust the constant term properly.

## 5: Evaluate option B
Option B, \((x+4)^{2}+2\), suggests that the \(+2\) in the original equation is left unchanged, which would be incorrect because completing the square involves changing the form of the equation, not just adding the constant to the squared term.

## 6: Evaluate option C
Option C, \((x+8)^{2}+2\), seems to incorrectly use \(8\) instead of \(4\) as the value to add within the squared term, indicating a misunderstanding of the process.

## 7: Evaluate option D
Option D, \((x+4)^{2}-16\), suggests subtracting \(16\) instead of \(14\), which indicates a miscalculation in the constant adjustment.

## 8: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level are likely to struggle significantly. They might choose C because it directly uses numbers from the original equation without modification (40% C, 20% A (if they recall the \(+4\)), 20% B, 20% D).
- **Basic**: Basic students might recall the formula but struggle with application. They could choose B or D due to simple arithmetic mistakes (30% B, 25% D, 20% A, 25% C).
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the method but may still make careless errors. They are likely to get it right or choose D due to a calculation slip (5% B, 5% C, 10% D, 80% A).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are highly unlikely to make errors in this process. They would almost certainly choose A (95% A, 5% across B, C, D).

## 9: Assign percentages
Based on typical student performance and the nature of the question:
- **below_basic**: A=10% B=15% C=40% D=35%
- **basic**: A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%
- **proficient**: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
- **advanced**: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=40% D=35%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
