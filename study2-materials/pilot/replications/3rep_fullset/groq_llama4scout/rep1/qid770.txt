To approach this question, let's first analyze the content and the potential misconceptions involved.

The question involves multiplying a fraction by a whole number: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 9 \). The correct calculation is straightforward: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 9 = \frac{9}{5} = 1\frac{4}{5} \). 

Tom says \( \frac{1}{5} \times 9 = 1\frac{4}{5} \), which is correct. 
Katie says \( \frac{1}{5} \times 9 = \frac{9}{45} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{1}{5} \) and is incorrect.

Common misconceptions might include:
1. Incorrectly converting between mixed numbers and improper fractions.
2. Misapplying multiplication rules for fractions and whole numbers.

Given these points, let's predict the student responses based on ability levels:

### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with basic fraction operations and conversions. 
- They might incorrectly agree with Katie due to not understanding how to multiply a fraction by a whole number properly or see her answer as a correct representation of a fraction.
- They might also not recognize Tom's answer as correct or understand why Katie's is incorrect.

Prediction: 
- A (Only Tom) = 20% (some might recognize Tom's correctness)
- B (Only Katie) = 40% (misconception or confusion)
- C (Both Tom and Katie) = 10% (lack of understanding)
- D (Neither is correct) = 30% (some critical thinking)

### basic
At this level, students have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to carelessness or not fully grasping the concepts.
- They are likely to recognize Tom's answer as correct.
- They might still be confused by Katie's incorrect simplification.

Prediction:
- A (Only Tom) = 60% 
- B (Only Katie) = 20%
- C (Both Tom and Katie) = 5%
- D (Neither is correct) = 15%

### proficient
Students at this level have a solid understanding of fractions and operations.
- They will easily identify Tom's correctness.
- They will also quickly see that Katie's answer is incorrect.

Prediction:
- A (Only Tom) = 80%
- B (Only Katie) = 5%
- C (Both Tom and Katie) = 0% (or close to it)
- D (Neither is correct) = 15%

### advanced
Advanced students not only have a strong grasp of the mathematical concepts but also can analyze the question critically.
- They will certainly recognize Tom's answer as correct.
- They will identify Katie's mistake.

Prediction:
- A (Only Tom) = 90%
- B (Only Katie) = 0% (or close to it)
- C (Both Tom and Katie) = 0% 
- D (Neither is correct) = 10%

Therefore, based on these analyses:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=0% D=15%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
