To solve this, let's consider the common misconceptions and the understanding required for each ability level.

The question tests the understanding that the sum of interior angles of a polygon can be calculated using the formula \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, which has 5 sides, the calculation is \((5-2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ\).

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may not understand the concept of calculating the sum of interior angles of a polygon or may not recall the formula. They might confuse it with the sum of exterior angles (which is always \(360^\circ\) for any polygon) or not know how to approach it. Therefore, they might choose \(A = 360^{\circ}\) (mistaking it for the sum of exterior angles), \(D\) (not enough information), or even guess \(C\) or \(B\) without a basis. Given the straightforward nature of the question once you know the formula, I predict: 
  - \(A = 40\%\) (common misconception)
  - \(B = 20\%\) (correct but requires formula knowledge)
  - \(C = 20\%\) (random or based on a different misunderstanding)
  - \(D = 20\%\) (lack of confidence or understanding)

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of geometry and might recall the formula or have been exposed to it. However, they might still struggle with applying it or have doubts. Therefore:
  - \(A = 20\%\) (less likely to confuse with exterior angles sum)
  - \(B = 60\%\) (correct, as they are more likely to apply the formula correctly)
  - \(C = 10\%\) (random guess or misunderstanding)
  - \(D = 10\%\) (still some doubt or lack of confidence)

- **Proficient**: These students are more confident and have a solid understanding of geometric principles, including the formula for the sum of interior angles. Thus:
  - \(A = 5\%\) (unlikely to fall into basic misconceptions)
  - \(B = 85\%\) (confidently apply the formula)
  - \(C = 5\%\) (very unlikely to choose incorrect options)
  - \(D = 5\%\) (highly unlikely to doubt the sufficiency of information)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only know the formula but can also apply it across various polygons and understand its derivation. Therefore:
  - \(A = 0\%\) (no chance of confusing with exterior angles)
  - \(B = 95\%\) (certain and confident)
  - \(C = 0\%\) (no chance of mistakenly selecting a higher value)
  - \(D = 5\%\) (purely speculative or checking for trick questions)

So, 
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
