To approach this question, let's first understand the algebraic concept being tested and the common misconceptions associated with it. The question involves expanding and simplifying the expression \((p-3)(p+3)\), which is a difference of squares. The correct expansion is \(p^2 - 3^2 = p^2 - 9\). Thus, the expression should simplify to \(p^2 - 9\), implying that \(\color{green}\bigcirc = -9\).

## Step 1: Identify the Algebraic Concept
The algebraic concept here is the difference of squares formula: \((a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2\). Applying this, \((p-3)(p+3) = p^2 - 3^2 = p^2 - 9\).

## 2: Analyze Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect application of the formula or mistakenly adding/subtracting terms. However, the structure of this question directly tests recognition of the difference of squares, which is a well-practiced formula.

## 3: Consider Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and could easily fall into common traps, such as mistakenly adding or not recognizing the correct application of the difference of squares formula.
- **Basic:** Basic level students might be familiar with the formula but could still make careless mistakes or not fully understand how to apply it in this context.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are likely to recognize the difference of squares and apply it correctly but might occasionally make a mistake if they misread the question or misapply the formula.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are expected to not only know the formula but also apply it correctly and be aware of common misconceptions.

## 4: Predict Student Responses
Given the simplicity of the question and the direct application of a well-known formula:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (thinking the \(3\) and \(-3\) add up), B=10% (guessing no number term), C=30% (thinking \(3 \times 3 = 9\) but not understanding subtraction), D=40% (correct, but might be guesswork).
- **Basic:** A=5% (less likely to make simple addition mistake), B=5% (aware there's a term), C=20% (common error in calculation or understanding), D=70% (more likely to apply formula correctly).
- **Proficient:** A=2% (rare mistake), B=2% (understanding there's a specific term), C=5% (error in calculation or misapplication), D=91% (accurately applying the formula).
- **Advanced:** A=0% (unlikely to make basic errors), B=0% (knowing the formula), C=1% (very rare mistake), D=99% (confident and accurate application).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=30% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=20% D=70%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=5% D=91%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=1% D=99%
