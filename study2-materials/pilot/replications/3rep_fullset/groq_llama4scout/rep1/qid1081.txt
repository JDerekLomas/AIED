To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the graphs provided.

The taxi company charges a £1.50 fixed charge and then £0.60 per mile. This means that the graph representing the cost of different length journeys should start at £1.50 (not at the origin) and increase linearly as the distance increases.

## Step 1: Analyzing the Correct Graph
The correct graph should have a positive y-intercept (starting at £1.50 on the cost axis) and should slope upwards to the right, indicating that as the distance increases, the cost also increases.

## 2: Evaluating Option A
Option A describes a graph that starts on the positive horizontal axis and travels horizontally right and upwards in a steep straight line. This does not match because it implies the graph starts at a distance greater than 0 with no initial cost, which contradicts the £1.50 fixed charge.

## 3: Evaluating Option B
Option B describes a graph that starts on the positive vertical axis and travels horizontally right. This suggests a constant cost for any distance, which does not match the given pricing structure.

## 4: Evaluating Option C
Option C describes a graph that starts at the origin and travels in a straight line right and upwards. This implies no fixed charge, only a charge per mile, which does not match the pricing structure.

## 5: Evaluating Option D
Option D describes a graph that starts at a point on the positive vertical axis and travels horizontally right and upwards in a straight line. This matches the expected graph because it starts at a positive cost (£1.50) on the vertical axis and increases linearly with distance.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding the concept of a fixed charge and a per-mile charge. They might choose graphs that seem to show an increase or a constant rate without properly accounting for the fixed charge. Option B (A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%) seems plausible for those who misunderstand the concept entirely, but most might lean towards a graph that shows some form of increase or a simple misunderstanding.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding but might still make errors in interpreting graphs. They might choose Option C (A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%) because it shows a linear relationship but fails to account for the fixed charge.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand linear relationships and should recognize the graph that starts with a fixed charge and increases linearly. They are likely to choose Option D (A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the concept but can also quickly identify the correct graph. They would likely choose Option D with high confidence (A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%).

The best answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
