To approach this question, let's consider the characteristics of each type of angle and the common misconceptions students might have:

1. **Acute Angle**: Less than 90 degrees.
2. **Obtuse Angle**: Greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees.
3. **Reflex Angle**: Greater than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees.
4. **Right Angle**: Exactly 90 degrees.

Given the description and the visual cue of an angle larger than 90 degrees but smaller than 180 degrees, we can predict student responses based on their understanding of these definitions.

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic angle definitions. They might confuse acute with obtuse or not understand the term reflex.
  - A (Acute): 30% (thinking it's less than 90 degrees)
  - B (Obtuse): 40% (correct understanding but let's assume they might struggle)
  - C (Reflex): 20% (might think it's more than 180 degrees, or confuse with obtuse)
  - D (A right angle): 10% (basic confusion)

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic concepts but might make careless mistakes.
  - A (Acute): 10% (knowing it's more than 90 degrees)
  - B (Obtuse): 70% (correct, as it matches their understanding)
  - C (Reflex): 15% (some might confuse, especially if not paying attention)
  - D (A right angle): 5% (less likely to think it's exactly 90 degrees)

- **Proficient**: These students understand angle types well but might be distracted by the question.
  - A (Acute): 5% (they know it's not less than 90 degrees)
  - B (Obtuse): 85% (correct understanding)
  - C (Reflex): 5% (unlikely to confuse with reflex)
  - D (A right angle): 5% (unlikely)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident in their understanding.
  - A (Acute): 0% (confident it's not acute)
  - B (Obtuse): 95% (correct and confident)
  - C (Reflex): 0% (know it's not reflex)
  - D (A right angle): 5% (highly unlikely but could be a guess)

Given these considerations, here's the formatted response:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
