To approach this question, let's first analyze the expression given and the potential simplifications or misconceptions that students might have.

The expression to simplify is:
\[
\frac{3m + 15}{m^2 - 2m + 15}
\]

## Step 1: Factor the numerator and denominator if possible.
The numerator can be factored as \(3(m + 5)\). The denominator, \(m^2 - 2m + 15\), does not factor easily because it represents a quadratic equation with no real roots (its discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(15) = 4 - 60 = -56 < 0\)), meaning it cannot be simplified into the product of two binomials with real coefficients.

## 2: Identify potential misconceptions or common errors.
A common misconception might involve attempting to cancel terms without properly factoring or ignoring the fact that the denominator does not factor into integers or simple expressions. Another error could be incorrectly factoring the denominator or trying to simplify without checking if the numerator and denominator share common factors.

## 3: Analyze the answer choices with potential student errors in mind.
- A: \( \frac{3}{m-2} \) suggests a incorrect simplification.
- B: \( \frac{3m}{m^2-2m} \) suggests another incorrect simplification.
- C: \( \frac{3}{m-3} \) implies a mistaken factorization or cancellation.
- D: \( \text{Does not simplify} \) is the correct answer since the numerator can be factored into \(3(m+5)\) but the denominator cannot be factored into simpler polynomials.

## 4: Consider student ability levels and their likely responses.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with even basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly try to cancel terms or not recognize that the denominator does not factor. Expect a high chance of choosing A, B, or C incorrectly.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic algebra but might still fall into traps. They might see \(3m + 15 = 3(m + 5)\) but not realize the denominator doesn't factor, potentially leading to some choosing A, B, or C.
- **Proficient:** These students understand algebra well and are less likely to make simple errors. They should recognize the denominator doesn't factor and thus should mostly choose D.
- **Advanced:** These students are highly competent and should easily see that the expression does not simplify further because the denominator cannot be factored.

## 5: Predict percentages based on understanding of algebra and common misconceptions.
- **Below Basic:** A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10% (Many errors due to lack of understanding)
- **Basic:** A=25% B=20% C=15% D=40% (Some understanding but prone to errors)
- **Proficient:** A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80% (Good understanding, fewer errors)
- **Advanced:** A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95% (High understanding, very few errors)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=15% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
