To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about the gradient of the line passing through the points (-3,-3), (-2,-2), (-1,-1), (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Concept of Gradient
The gradient (or slope) of a line is a measure of how steep it is and can be calculated using the formula: gradient = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are any two points on the line.

## 2: Analyzing the Given Line
The line passes through several points, including (-3,-3) and (3,3). Using these two points, we can calculate the gradient: gradient = (3 - (-3)) / (3 - (-3)) = 6 / 6 = 1. This calculation confirms that the gradient of the line is 1.

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing the gradient with other aspects of the line or misapplying the formula. However, given the straightforward nature of this question and the fact that the line's gradient is clearly 1 (as it rises 1 unit for every 1 unit it runs), most students should recognize this.

## 4: Assessing Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic concepts. They might not understand what the gradient represents or how to calculate it. There's a possibility they could choose A (0) if they mistakenly think the line is flat, or they might be confused by the concept and choose randomly.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may make simple mistakes. Given the simplicity of the line (y = x), most should be able to calculate or intuitively understand the gradient is 1, but some might still struggle.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of the concepts and should easily identify the gradient as 1. Misconceptions should be minimal.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concept but can apply it effortlessly. They should all correctly identify the gradient as 1.

## 5: Predicting Responses
Given the line is clearly y = x, which has a gradient of 1:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (mistaking for a flat line), B=10% (random guess), C=10% (misinterpreting the variable), D=60% (correct, through luck or some understanding).
- **Basic:** A=5% (unlikely to think it's flat), B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.
- **Proficient:** A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

The best answer is D.
