## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question involves sharing gold coins among Percy, Quentin, and Robbie in a given ratio of 3:7:8. It also provides that Percy gets 36 fewer coins than Quentin. We need to find out how many gold coins Robbie gets.

## 2: Setting Up the Ratio
Let's denote the number of coins Percy, Quentin, and Robbie get as 3x, 7x, and 8x respectively, based on the ratio given.

## 3: Using the Given Condition
We are told Percy gets 36 fewer coins than Quentin. This can be written as 7x - 3x = 36.

## 4: Solving for x
Solving the equation 4x = 36 gives x = 36 / 4 = 9.

## 5: Finding the Number of Coins Robbie Gets
To find out how many coins Robbie gets, we substitute x = 9 into 8x, which gives 8 * 9 = 72.

## 6: Analyzing the Options
The correct answer is B) 72. Now, let's consider how students at different ability levels might respond.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with setting up the equation or solving for x. They might incorrectly calculate or choose an option without proper calculation. Given the straightforward nature of the calculation once the equation is set up, they might be tempted by simple ratios or incorrect calculations, potentially leading to a spread across incorrect options. A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
- **Basic**: Basic level students should be able to set up the ratio and equation but might make calculation errors. They are likely to understand the concept of ratios and differences but might struggle with solving for x or substituting back. B=70% A=15% C=5% D=10%
- **Proficient**: Proficient students should easily solve the problem with minimal errors. They understand ratios, can set up and solve equations, and substitute back to find the answer. B=90% A=5% C=2% D=3%
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will not only solve the problem correctly but might also be able to apply more complex concepts or verify their answers. For them, this problem is straightforward, and errors would be minimal. B=95% A=3% C=1% D=1%

## 8: Formatting the Response
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
- basic: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
- advanced: A=3% B=95% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=3% B=95% C=1% D=1%
