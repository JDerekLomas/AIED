To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given equation \(0.45 = 0.3p\), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

## Step 1: Understanding the Equation
The equation to solve is \(0.45 = 0.3p\). This requires isolating \(p\), which involves dividing both sides by 0.3.

## 2: Solving the Equation
To solve for \(p\), we perform the operation:
\[p = \frac{0.45}{0.3}\]

## 3: Calculation
Calculating the value:
\[p = \frac{0.45}{0.3} = 1.5\]

## 4: Analyzing the Options
- A: \(p = \frac{2}{3}\)
- B: \(p = 1.5\)
- C: \(p = 0.135\)
- D: \(p = 0.15\)

## 5: Identifying the Correct Answer
The correct solution to the equation is \(p = 1.5\), which corresponds to option B.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations or decimal division. They might incorrectly calculate or choose an option that seems to relate to the numbers given in a simplistic way, such as multiplying or adding the numbers incorrectly.
  - A: 20% (miscalculation, converting decimals to fractions incorrectly)
  - B: 40% (correct calculation, but let's assume some get it right)
  - C: 15% (incorrect calculation, possibly multiplying 0.45 by 0.3)
  - D: 25% (possibly dividing 0.45 by 3 or another incorrect operation)

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic algebra and can perform simple calculations.
  - A: 10% (some might confuse operations or convert decimals to fractions)
  - B: 70% (most should get the correct answer)
  - C: 5% (unlikely to choose this as it involves a more complex incorrect operation)
  - D: 15% (some might divide incorrectly or confuse operations)

- **Proficient**: Students at this level are comfortable with algebraic manipulations and decimal operations.
  - A: 5% (unlikely, as they should recognize the fraction doesn't match)
  - B: 85% (most will solve it correctly)
  - C: 2% (very unlikely, as it suggests a misunderstanding of operations)
  - D: 8% (some might still make simple calculation errors)

- **Advanced**: Students here are highly confident in their algebraic skills and less likely to make basic calculation errors.
  - A: 2% (very unlikely)
  - B: 95% (almost all will solve it correctly)
  - C: 1% (extremely unlikely)
  - D: 2% (unlikely, as they should easily identify the correct operation)

## 7: Conclusion
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation and the fact that it doesn't heavily rely on complex algebraic manipulations or conceptual understanding beyond simple division of decimals, most students, even at lower ability levels, should be able to solve it correctly, with the exception of those below basic who might struggle significantly.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
