To approach this question, let's first understand what it's testing. The question requires students to calculate the area of the shaded section in a rectangle. The total area of the rectangle can be found by multiplying its length by its width, but since only a part of it is shaded, students need to figure out the correct calculation to find the shaded area.

The dimensions given are 20 (total length), 8 (width of both the shaded and unshaded parts), and 6 (length of the unshaded part). This implies the shaded part's length is 20 - 6 = 14 units.

## Step 1: Understanding the Shaded Area
The shaded area can be calculated by finding the area of the whole rectangle that includes the shaded part and then subtracting the area of the unshaded part. Alternatively, one could directly calculate the shaded area by considering it as a rectangle with dimensions 8 by 14.

## 2: Calculating the Shaded Area
- The area of the shaded part can be directly calculated as \(8 \times 14\).
- Another way to think about it is to calculate the area of the whole rectangle (\(8 \times 20\)) and subtract the area of the unshaded part (\(8 \times 6\)), which gives \(8 \times 20 - 8 \times 6\).

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(8 \times 20 - 8 \times 6\) correctly calculates the shaded area by subtracting the unshaded part's area from the total area.
- Option B: \(8 \times 20 + 8 \times 6\) would add the unshaded part, which is incorrect.
- Option C: \(8 \times 14 - 8 \times 6\) suggests calculating the shaded part directly and then subtracting the unshaded part, which doesn't make sense as it subtracts an area not related to the shaded part's calculation directly.
- Option D: \(8 \times 14 + 8 \times 6\) adds the area of the shaded part to the unshaded part, effectively calculating the total area, not just the shaded part.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the question or applying basic formulas. They might choose an option that seems to add or subtract without fully understanding the context. Option B (\(8 \times 20 + 8 \times 6\)) might appeal due to its simplicity, but errors in understanding what is asked could lead to random selections. \(A=30\%\), \(B=40\%\), \(C=15\%\), \(D=15\%\).
- **Basic**: Students here understand basic area calculations but might not apply them correctly in context. They might recognize that \(8 \times 20 - 8 \times 6\) (Option A) could work but could be tempted by incorrect additions or subtractions. \(A=50\%\), \(B=30\%\), \(C=10\%\), \(D=10\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students can apply formulas accurately and understand the context. They should easily identify Option A as correct. \(A=80\%\), \(B=10\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=5\%\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the formulas but can also analyze the question critically. They should have no trouble identifying the correct option and avoiding misconceptions. \(A=95\%\), \(B=3\%\), \(C=1\%\), \(D=1\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
