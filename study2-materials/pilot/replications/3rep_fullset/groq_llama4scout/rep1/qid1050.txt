To approach this question, let's consider what students at different levels might do when faced with factorising \(18a - 12\).

## Step 1: Identify the Factorisation Requirement
The question requires students to factorise the expression \(18a - 12\) fully. This means finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of \(18a\) and \(12\) and dividing each term by this GCF.

## 2: Determine the GCF
The GCF of \(18a\) and \(12\) is \(6\), since \(6\) is the largest number that divides both \(18\) and \(12\) without a remainder, and there's no common variable factor.

## 3: Factorise the Expression
Dividing each term by \(6\), we get \(18a / 6 = 3a\) and \(12 / 6 = 2\). So, \(18a - 12 = 6(3a - 2)\).

## 4: Evaluate Option Difficulty
- Option A: \(2(9a - 6)\) might seem plausible but doesn't represent a full factorisation since \(9a - 6\) can be further factorised by \(3\), yielding \(3(3a - 2)\), and then \(2 \times 3 = 6\), which matches our correct factorisation but isn't directly offered.
- Option B: \(18(a - \frac{2}{3})\) or simply put, not directly given but implies a misunderstanding.
- Option C: \(6(3a - 2)\) is the correct full factorisation.
- Option D: \(9(2a - 1)\) is incorrect because \(9(2a - 1) = 18a - 9\), not \(18a - 12\).

## 5: Analyze Potential Student Errors
- Students below basic might not understand factorisation or might not identify the GCF correctly, potentially leading them to choose an option that doesn't correctly factor the expression, like B or D.
- Basic students might recognise the need for factorisation but could struggle with identifying the correct GCF or distributing it properly, potentially choosing A or B.
- Proficient students should easily identify \(6\) as the GCF and factorise correctly to \(6(3a - 2)\), choosing C.
- Advanced students would also choose C but might quickly see that options A, B, and D are incorrect through mental maths.

## 6: Estimate Response Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question once the GCF is identified, and assuming most students have a basic understanding of factorisation:
- **Below Basic**: Might not accurately factor; could choose B (\(20\%\)), D (\(20\%\)), A (\(30\%\)), with C (\(30\%\)) if they somehow stumble upon it.
- **Basic**: Should start to understand factorisation; likely to choose C (\(50\%\)), with some errors to A (\(20\%\)), B (\(15\%\)), D (\(15\%\)).
- **Proficient**: Highly likely to choose C (\(80\%\)), with fewer errors; A (\(10\%\)), B (\(5\%\)), D (\(5\%\)).
- **Advanced**: Almost certainly choose C (\(90\%\)), with minimal consideration for other options; A (\(5\%\)), B (\(2\%\)), D (\(3\%\)).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
