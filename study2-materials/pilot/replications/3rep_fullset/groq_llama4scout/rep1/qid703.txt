To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions or understanding related to the properties of a quadrilateral, specifically a parallelogram.

The question presents a parallelogram with one angle given as \(65^{\circ}\) in the bottom left corner. The task is to find the size of angle \(p\) in the top left corner.

## Understanding Parallelograms
In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary (add up to \(180^{\circ}\)).

## Analyzing the Question
Given that one angle is \(65^{\circ}\), the adjacent angle must be \(180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} = 115^{\circ}\). Since opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal, angle \(p\) must also be \(115^{\circ}\).

## Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the properties of parallelograms or might not be able to apply them correctly. They might choose \(A = 65^{\circ}\) because they mistakenly think opposite angles are not equal or they don't see the relationship between angles. Some might choose \(D = \text{Not enough information}\) due to a lack of understanding. 
  - Below Basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of geometric shapes and might recall that adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary. However, they might still make simple mistakes.
  - Basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%

- **Proficient**: Students at this level are likely to understand the properties of parallelograms well. They should easily recognize that angle \(p\) and the \(65^{\circ}\) angle are supplementary because they are adjacent angles in a parallelogram.
  - Proficient: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%

- **Advanced**: Students at this advanced level have a deep understanding and can apply properties of parallelograms with ease. They are less likely to make errors.
  - Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
