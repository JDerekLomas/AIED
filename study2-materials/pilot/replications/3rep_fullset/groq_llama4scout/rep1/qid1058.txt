To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's first understand the concept being tested and the specific challenge of this question.

The question involves reflecting a point across the line \(y = -x\). The general rule for reflecting a point \((x, y)\) across the line \(y = -x\) is that the new coordinates become \((-y, -x)\). 

Given point \(Q\) has coordinates \((-3, 3)\), applying the reflection rule:

- The new x-coordinate is \(-y = -3\)
- The new y-coordinate is \(-x = -(-3) = 3\)

So, the new coordinates of \(Q\) after reflection across \(y = -x\) are \((-3, 3)\).

Let's analyze the options:
A: \((3, 3)\)
B: \((-3, -3)\)
C: \((-3, 3)\)
D: \((3, -3)\)

Applying the correct rule, the correct answer is C: \((-3, 3)\), as it matches the original point, which might seem unexpected but is correct because reflecting \((-3, 3)\) across \(y = -x\) indeed yields \((-3, 3)\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception could be not applying the transformation correctly or confusing it with reflections across the x-axis, y-axis, or the line \(y = x\). However, this question specifically tests the understanding of reflecting across \(y = -x\).

## 2: Analyzing Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not understand the concept of reflection across a line other than the axes. They might confuse the transformation or apply incorrect rules. Given the simplicity of the coordinates and the line \(y = -x\), some might mistakenly think the point stays the same (C), but others might incorrectly apply a transformation they think is correct, potentially leading to A, B, or D. However, given the straightforward nature of applying \((-y, -x)\), errors might be less frequent than expected, but confusion could lead to:
  - A: 20% (guessing or incorrect application)
  - B: 20% ( incorrect transformation)
  - C: 40% (correct or no change perceived)
  - D: 20% (another incorrect transformation)

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might struggle with applying the specific transformation correctly. They are more likely to recognize that a change occurs but might apply it incorrectly:
  - A: 15%
  - B: 15%
  - C: 60% (correct application or recognizing no change)
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient**: These students understand the transformation and are likely to apply it correctly. The question's specificity and the straightforward coordinates make errors less likely:
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 85%
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the transformation but are also less likely to make careless mistakes. They would quickly and accurately apply the transformation:
  - A: 0%
  - B: 0%
  - C: 95%
  - D: 5% (potentially due to a very careless mistake)

## 3: Adjusting Predictions
Considering the specific nature of the question and typical student errors, the predictions need adjustment. The correct answer, C, seems straightforward to those who understand the reflection across \(y = -x\), but common misconceptions might still trap some students.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=15% C=60% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
