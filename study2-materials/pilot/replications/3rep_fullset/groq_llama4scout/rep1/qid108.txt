To solve this, let's consider what the question is asking and the common misconceptions associated with multiplying out brackets, particularly with the distributive property (also known as FOIL when dealing with binomials).

The question asks for the product of the two terms indicated by the arrows in the expression \((x+5)(x-3)\), which are \(5\) and \(-3\). The correct calculation is \(5 \times -3 = -15\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task requires predicting the percentage of students at different ability levels (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option provided.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve incorrectly applying the rules of signs or misunderstanding the operation (e.g., adding instead of multiplying). However, given that the question specifically points to the terms \(+5\) and \(-3\), the main task is to multiply these, which is a straightforward operation.

## 3: Analyzing Each Option
- A: \(+2\). This could result from an incorrect operation or misunderstanding of the numbers involved.
- B: \(-15\). This is the correct result of multiplying \(5\) by \(-3\).
- C: \(-8\). This might result from an incorrect calculation or operation.
- D: \(+15\). This could result from ignoring the negative sign.

## 4: Considering Student Ability Levels
- **Below_Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic operations and are more prone to errors. They might not understand that multiplying a positive by a negative yields a negative.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple arithmetic mistakes or misunderstand the application of operations.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the operations but might occasionally make careless mistakes.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of the concepts and are less likely to make errors.

## 5: Predicting Responses
Given the simplicity of the operation (\(5 \times -3\)) and assuming most students at all levels can perform this basic multiplication:
- **Below_Basic**: A=20% (completely off), B=40% (getting it right), C=20% (another incorrect option), D=20% (ignoring the negative sign).
- **Basic**: A=5% (unlikely but possible mistake), B=90% (most get it right), C=3% (unlikely mistake), D=2% (small chance of ignoring the sign).
- **Proficient**: A=1% (very unlikely), B=98% (almost all get it right), C=0.5% (extremely unlikely), D=0.5% (extremely unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (no chance), B=100% (all get it right), C=0% (no chance), D=0% (no chance).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
proficient: A=1% B=98% C=0.5% D=0.5%
advanced: A=0% B=100% C=0% D=0%
