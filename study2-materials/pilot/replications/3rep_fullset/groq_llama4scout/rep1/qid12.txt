To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions involved.

The question revolves around the concept of alternate angles. Alternate angles are a property of parallel lines cut by a transversal, where the angles are on opposite sides of the transversal and outside (or inside) the parallel lines. For two lines to have alternate angles, they must be parallel. If the lines are not parallel, the angles formed are not equal, even if they are alternate.

Given the diagram shows two non-parallel lines intersected by another line, with angles \( p \) and \( q \) both on the outside of the lines and on opposite sides of the transversal, we can deduce the following:

1. **Angles \( p \) and \( q \) are indeed alternate angles** because they are on opposite sides of the transversal and are exterior to the lines. However, 
2. **They are not equal** because the lines are not parallel.

Therefore, Tom is correct that angles \( p \) and \( q \) are alternate, but Katie is incorrect that angles \( p \) and \( q \) are equal.

Let's predict the student responses based on ability levels:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic geometric vocabulary and properties. They might not understand what "alternate angles" mean or might confuse properties of angles in different contexts.
  - A (Only Tom): 40% (acknowledge the correct terminology but might not fully grasp implications)
  - B (Only Katie): 20% (mistakenly think angles are equal without understanding parallel line requirements)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 10% (some might incorrectly think both are right due to lack of understanding)
  - D (Neither is correct): 30% (might not understand the terminology or its implications)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with nuances.
  - A (Only Tom): 60% (understand alternate angles but might not apply correctly here)
  - B (Only Katie): 15% (some still confuse equality with parallel lines)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 5% (less likely to think both are correct with some understanding)
  - D (Neither is correct): 20% (recognize both have incorrect assumptions)

- **Proficient:** Students with a good grasp of geometry.
  - A (Only Tom): 80% (clearly understand alternate angles and the condition for equality)
  - B (Only Katie): 5%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 2% (very few would mistakenly believe both)
  - D (Neither is correct): 13% (a few might question based on diagram or conditions)

- **Advanced:** Students who not only understand but can apply concepts accurately.
  - A (Only Tom): 90% 
  - B (Only Katie): 2%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 1%
  - D (Neither is correct): 7%

So, based on these analyses:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=2% D=13%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=1% D=7%
