To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or areas of difficulty.

The question requires students to apply the correct algebraic convention for writing expressions, specifically for the given calculation \( l \times 3 \times l \times l \times g \times g \). The correct algebraic convention involves grouping like terms together and using exponents to denote repeated multiplication.

## Step 1: Identify the Correct Answer
The correct answer, based on algebraic conventions, is \( 3l^3g^2 \) which matches option C: \( 3 g^{2} l^{3} \) when considering the commutative property of multiplication.

## 2: Analyze Potential Misconceptions and Difficulty
- A common misconception might be not applying the exponent rules correctly or not grouping like terms.
- The question might be challenging for students who are not familiar with or do not consistently apply algebraic conventions.

## 3: Consider Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic expressions and might not understand or apply exponent rules correctly. They might choose A because it represents a straightforward multiplication without applying any rules.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have some understanding of algebra but might make errors in applying conventions. They might choose A or B due to a lack of understanding of how to correctly represent repeated multiplication.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level should have a good grasp of algebraic conventions. They are likely to choose C, but some might mistakenly choose B if they incorrectly apply exponent rules or do not properly group terms.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to be very comfortable with algebraic expressions and conventions. They should easily identify C as the correct answer.

## 4: Estimate Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=60% (straightforward but incorrect), B=20% (some understanding but incorrect), C=10% (correct but challenging), D=10% (incorrect).
- **Basic:** A=30%, B=25%, C=35%, D=10%.
- **Proficient:** A=10%, B=15%, C=70%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=5%, C=90%, D=5%.

The best answer is C. 

Below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
Basic: A=30% B=25% C=35% D=10%
Proficient: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
Advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
