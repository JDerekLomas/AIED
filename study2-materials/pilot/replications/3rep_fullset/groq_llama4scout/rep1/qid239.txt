To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing: the understanding of the general form of a quadratic function graph, specifically that it can be either a positive (U-shaped) or a negative (inverted U-shaped) parabola.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The question aims to identify if students understand that both a U-shaped (positive) and an inverted U-shaped (negative) graph can represent a quadratic function. A common misconception might be that only one form is possible.

## 2: Analyzing the Graphs
- Tom's graph represents a positive quadratic function (a U-shaped graph).
- Katie's graph represents a negative quadratic function (an inverted U-shaped graph).

## 3: Identifying Correctness
Both Tom and Katie can be correct because a quadratic function can have a graph that is either a U-shape (when the coefficient of \(x^2\) is positive) or an inverted U-shape (when the coefficient of \(x^2\) is negative).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the characteristics of quadratic graphs. They might think only one type of graph (U or inverted U) represents a quadratic function or might not recognize either as a quadratic. Therefore, they might choose A or B (thinking only one person is correct) or D (thinking neither is correct), with a significant chance of selecting D due to confusion. 
  - Below Basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a basic understanding of quadratic equations and their graphs. They should know that quadratic graphs can be U-shaped or inverted U-shaped. However, they might still make mistakes due to lack of confidence or understanding. Expect a good percentage to choose C, but some might still opt for A or B.
  - Basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%

- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid understanding of quadratic functions and their graphs. They should easily recognize both graphs as representing quadratic functions. The most common answer should be C, with very few opting for A, B, or D.
  - Proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%

- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the concept but can also apply it to various contexts. They would definitely recognize both graphs as quadratic. The expectation is that almost all would choose C, with very minimal error.
  - Advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
