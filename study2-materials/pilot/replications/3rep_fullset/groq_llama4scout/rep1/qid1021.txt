To solve this, let's first analyze the equation and the statements made by Jo and Paul.

The equation given is \(x^{2} - 9x = 0\). 

## Step 1: Factor the equation
We can factor out an \(x\) from the equation: \(x(x - 9) = 0\).

## Step 2: Solve for \(x\)
Using the zero product property, we find \(x = 0\) or \(x - 9 = 0\), which gives \(x = 9\). 

## 3: Evaluate Jo and Paul's statements
Jo says one solution is \(x = 0\), which is correct based on our solution. 
Paul says one solution is \(x = 3\), which is incorrect because \(x = 3\) does not satisfy the equation.

## 4: Determine the correct answer
Since Jo is correct (\(x = 0\) is a solution) and Paul is incorrect (\(x = 3\) is not a solution), but \(x = 9\) is also a solution, the correct answer is that only Jo is correct.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and factoring. They might not correctly solve the equation or understand the concept of solutions. They could mistakenly think Paul is correct or that neither is correct due to a lack of understanding. \(A = 40\%\), \(B = 30\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 20\%\)
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra and can likely factor the equation. They might recognize \(x = 0\) as a solution but could be tricked into thinking Paul's solution could be valid or not understand how to verify Paul's claim. \(A = 60\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 10\%\)
- **Proficient:** Students at this level should easily solve the equation and verify Jo's and Paul's claims. They understand that \(x = 0\) is a solution and \(x = 3\) is not. \(A = 80\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 10\%\)
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only solve the equation correctly but also understand the implications of their solutions. They would quickly identify Jo as correct and Paul as incorrect. \(A = 90\%\), \(B = 0\%\), \(C = 5\%\), \(D = 5\%\)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
