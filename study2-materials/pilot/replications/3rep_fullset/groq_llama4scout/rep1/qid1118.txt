To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's first analyze the question and the potential misconceptions involved.

The question revolves around the concept of similarity in geometry, specifically for rectangles. Two rectangles are similar if the ratio of their corresponding sides (widths and heights) is equal. 

## Step 1: Understanding Similarity
For Tom's rectangles: 
- One rectangle has a width of 2cm and a height of 3cm.
- The other rectangle has a width of 4cm and a height of 6cm is not given, instead, it's 4cm and 9cm.
We calculate the ratios: width ratio = 4/2 = 2, height ratio = 9/3 = 3. Since 2 ≠ 3, Tom's rectangles are not similar.

## 2: Analyzing Katie's Rectangles
For Katie's rectangles:
- One rectangle has a width of 4cm and a height of 6cm.
- The other rectangle has a width of 7cm and a height of 9cm.
We calculate the ratios: width ratio = 7/4, height ratio = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. 
To compare, convert 7/4 into a decimal or find a common denominator: 7/4 = 1.75. Since 1.75 ≠ 1.5, Katie's rectangles are not similar.

## 3: Evaluating Student Responses
Given the calculations:
- Tom is incorrect because his rectangles are not similar (2:3 ≠ 4:9).
- Katie is incorrect because her rectangles are not similar (4:6 ≠ 7:9).

## 4: Predicting Student Errors
- **Below Basic**: Students may struggle with ratios and fractions. They might incorrectly assume similarity based on visual inspection or fail to calculate ratios properly. 
  - A (Only Tom) = 20% (some might mistakenly think Tom's are similar)
  - B (Only Katie) = 15% (similar reasoning)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie) = 10% (optimistic but wrong)
  - D (Neither is correct) = 55% (closest to understanding both are wrong)

- **Basic**: Students should have a basic understanding of ratios but might make calculation errors.
  - A = 15%
  - B = 10%
  - C = 5%
  - D = 70%

- **Proficient**: Students understand the concept of similarity and can apply it.
  - A = 5%
  - B = 5%
  - C = 2%
  - D = 88%

- **Advanced**: Students not only understand similarity but can also quickly assess and calculate ratios.
  - A = 2%
  - B = 2%
  - C = 1%
  - D = 95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=5% D=70%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=2% D=88%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=1% D=95%
