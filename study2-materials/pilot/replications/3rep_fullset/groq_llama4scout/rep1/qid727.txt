To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's first understand the function machine's process:

1. Take the input number.
2. Add 5 to it.
3. Double the result.

Given the inputs are 4 and 9, let's calculate the outputs:

- For input 4: \(4 + 5 = 9\), then \(9 \times 2 = 18\).
- For input 9: \(9 + 5 = 14\), then \(14 \times 2 = 28\).

So, the correct output is 18 and 28, which corresponds to option B.

Now, let's analyze the potential misconceptions and the difficulty level of the question:

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The most common misconception in such function machines involves misunderstanding the order of operations. However, this question clearly outlines a simple, sequential process (add 5, then double), which reduces the likelihood of operational errors if the student understands basic arithmetic operations.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A (9 and 14) seems to reflect the results after adding 5 but before doubling, suggesting some students might get stuck on the first step and forget to apply the second step.

## 3: Analyzing Option C
Option C (81 and 196) seems to result from squaring the numbers added by 5 (i.e., \(4+5=9, 9^2=81\) and \(9+5=14, 14^2=196\)), indicating a possible misconception where students mistakenly square the result instead of doubling it.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D (-3 and -0.5) does not seem to follow any straightforward operation related to the given function machine, suggesting it could be a distractor for students who either misunderstand the operations entirely or make significant calculation errors.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations or understanding the sequence of operations. They might choose A (20%), C (20%), or D (30%) due to confusion, with B being correct (30%).
- **Basic:** Basic level students would likely understand the sequence but might make calculation errors. They might choose A (15%) because they forget to double, C (10%) due to incorrect operation, or D (5%) due to significant error, with B being the most popular choice (60%).
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the operations and sequence. They might still choose A (5%) if they mistakenly stop at adding 5, but B would be the correct and most chosen option (90%), with minimal selection of C or D.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students would likely get it right without issues, choosing B (95%), with very few opting for other incorrect options.

Given these considerations, here are the predictions:

below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=3% D=2%
