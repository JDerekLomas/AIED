## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question provides the first and fourth terms of a linear sequence and asks for the eighth term. The first term is 7, and the fourth term is 25.

## 2: Identifying the sequence's common difference
To find the common difference (d) of the sequence, we use the formula for the nth term of a linear sequence: \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\), where \(a_n\) is the nth term, \(a_1\) is the first term, and \(d\) is the common difference. Given \(a_1 = 7\) and \(a_4 = 25\), we can substitute these values into the formula to find \(d\).
\[25 = 7 + (4-1)d\]
\[25 = 7 + 3d\]
\[18 = 3d\]
\[d = 6\]

## 3: Calculating the eighth term
Now that we know the common difference \(d = 6\), we can find the eighth term (\(a_8\)) using the formula:
\[a_8 = a_1 + (8-1)d\]
\[a_8 = 7 + 7 \times 6\]
\[a_8 = 7 + 42\]
\[a_8 = 49\]

## 4: Analyzing potential student responses
- The correct answer is A: 49.
- To predict student responses, we consider common misconceptions and errors in sequence questions. A common error might be not recognizing the sequence is linear or miscalculating the common difference.

## 5: Predicting student responses by ability level
### below_basic
Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic or understanding sequence concepts. They might incorrectly calculate the common difference or not apply it correctly.
- A: 20% (those who guess or partially understand)
- B: 15% (incorrect calculation)
- C: 30% (possibly adding or subtracting incorrectly)
- D: 35% (another incorrect calculation)

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding but might make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- A: 50% (understand the concept but might make calculation mistakes)
- B: 20% (miscalculation of the common difference or term)
- C: 20% (arithmetic error)
- D: 10% (less likely to choose an obviously incorrect option)

### proficient
Students at this level understand linear sequences and can apply the formula correctly.
- A: 80% (correct calculation)
- B: 5% (unlikely to make a simple mistake)
- C: 10% (possible mistake in calculation)
- D: 5% (unlikely incorrect option)

### advanced
Students at this level are confident and accurate in their calculations.
- A: 95% (accurately calculate the term)
- B: 0% (unlikely to choose an incorrect option)
- C: 3% (very unlikely mistake)
- D: 2% (very unlikely incorrect option)

## 6: Finalizing predictions
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the calculations involved, most students, especially those at the proficient and advanced levels, are likely to get it correct.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=3% D=2%
