## Step 1: Understand the question and the pictogram
The question provides a pictogram representing Bob's music collection, with different types of music and the number of CDs for each type. Each symbol in the pictogram represents 4 CDs. The task is to find out how many more Pop CDs Bob has than Rock CDs.

## 2: Calculate the number of Pop and Rock CDs
From the pictogram, Pop has 3 and a half symbols, and Rock has 2 symbols. Since each symbol represents 4 CDs, the number of Pop CDs is \(3.5 \times 4 = 14\) and the number of Rock CDs is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

## 3: Determine the difference between Pop and Rock CDs
To find how many more Pop CDs Bob has than Rock CDs, subtract the number of Rock CDs from the number of Pop CDs: \(14 - 8 = 6\).

## 4: Analyze the answer choices
The correct calculation yields 6 more Pop CDs than Rock CDs. Let's compare this to the given options:
- A: \(4.5\)
- B: \(5\)
- C: \(1.5\)
- D: \(6\)

## 5: Consider potential misconceptions and errors
A common misconception might involve misinterpreting the pictogram or incorrectly calculating the difference. However, given that the question explicitly states each symbol represents 4 CDs and provides clear numbers, the main challenge lies in accurate calculation rather than conceptual understanding.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with reading the pictogram, converting symbols to numbers, or performing the subtraction. They might incorrectly calculate or choose an option without calculation. Given the straightforward nature of the calculation, some might guess or incorrectly calculate, potentially leading to a spread across options but with a higher chance of selecting A, B, or C due to miscalculation.
- **Basic**: Students here would likely understand the concept but might make simple arithmetic errors. They could calculate the Pop CDs as 14 and Rock CDs as 8 but then make a mistake in subtraction or not perform it at all, leading to selections of A, B, or C.
- **Proficient**: These students would accurately read the pictogram, convert symbols to CD numbers, and perform the subtraction correctly. They are likely to choose D: \(6\).
- **Advanced**: Similar to proficient students, they would have no issue with the arithmetic or understanding the pictogram, thus also likely to choose D: \(6\).

## 7: Estimate percentages for each ability level
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (misread pictogram), B=15% (guessing), C=10% (simple error), D=55% (somehow managed to get it right or guessed correctly).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=10%, C=5%, D=75% (most get it right with some errors).
- **Proficient**: A=5%, B=5%, C=0%, D=90% (accurate calculation).
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100% (no errors expected).

## 8: Refine estimates based on question specifics
Given the simplicity and directness of the question, even lower-ability students are likely to perform relatively well. The question does not particularly lend itself to common misconceptions that would lead to widespread errors beyond simple arithmetic mistakes.

The best answer is D.
