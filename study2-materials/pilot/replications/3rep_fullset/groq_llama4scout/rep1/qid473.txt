To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question asks for the value of the digit \(3\) in the number \(43075\). The correct answer is \(3000\), which corresponds to option D.

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic place value understanding. They might not accurately identify the position of the digit \(3\) or understand its value.
  - A (\(30000\)): This could appeal to students who misunderstand the place value of \(3\) entirely, thinking it's in the ten-thousands place but not quite sure, or simply guessing.
  - B (\(3\)): This might seem correct to students who only read the digit without considering its place value.
  - C (\(30\)): This could be chosen by students who incorrectly place the \(3\) in the tens place.
  - D (\(3000\)): This is the correct answer, but students below the basic level might struggle to achieve this.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding of place value but may still make errors, especially if they haven't fully grasped the concept or if the number is presented in a way that suggests a different place value.
  - A (\(30000\)): Less likely here since basic students should know \(3\) is not in the ten-thousands place.
  - B (\(3\)): Still a potential choice for those not fully understanding place value.
  - C (\(30\)): Could be considered by those slightly misunderstanding the digit's position.
  - D (\(3000\)): Should be within the grasp of basic students as it reflects a clear understanding of \(3\) being in the thousands place.

- **Proficient**: Students at this level have a solid understanding of place value and should be able to accurately determine the value of the \(3\).
  - A (\(30000\)): Unlikely as proficient students know \(3\) isn't in the ten-thousands place.
  - B (\(3\)): Unlikely as they understand the concept of place value.
  - C (\(30\)): Unlikely for the same reason.
  - D (\(3000\)): This should be a straightforward choice.

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand place value but can apply it in various contexts. They are less likely to make errors on this type of question.
  - A (\(30000\)), B (\(3\)), C (\(30\)): All unlikely as advanced students have a firm grasp of place value.
  - D (\(3000\)): The obvious correct choice.

Given these considerations, here are the predicted percentages:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=20% C=10% D=65%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=3% D=90%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
