## Step 1: Understand the question and the content it tests
The question asks students to simplify the expression \(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}\), if possible. This expression involves the addition of two square roots, which cannot be simplified into a single square root or a simpler form using standard algebraic manipulations because the radicands (the numbers under the square roots) are not the same.

## 2: Identify common misconceptions
A common misconception might involve attempting to add the square roots directly as if they were like terms, or incorrectly applying properties of square roots. For example, some students might mistakenly think that \(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5} = \sqrt{3+5} = \sqrt{8}\), which is option B.

## 3: Analyze option A
Option A, \(3\sqrt{5}\), suggests a misunderstanding where a student might incorrectly factor or manipulate the expression to fit this form, which does not apply here.

## 4: Analyze option B
Option B, \(\sqrt{8}\), is a plausible mistake since it incorrectly applies the rule for adding square roots. Students might think \(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a+b}\), which is not true.

## 5: Analyze option C
Option C, \(\sqrt{15}\), is another potential mistake, suggesting \(\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{5} = \sqrt{15}\), but this confuses multiplication with addition.

## 6: Analyze option D
Option D, "Cannot be simplified," is the correct answer. The expression \(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}\) cannot be simplified further because the terms are not like terms and do not share a common radicand.

## 7: Predict student responses by ability level
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level are likely to make significant errors. They might attempt to add the numbers under the square root (leading to option C, \(\sqrt{15}\)) or try to combine them in a nonsensical way (option A, \(3\sqrt{5}\)). Option B (\(\sqrt{8}\)) could also be a choice for those who misunderstand basic square root properties. Option D might be less likely chosen as they may not fully grasp the concept of simplification in this context. Predicted percentages: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%.
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a foundational understanding but may still fall into traps. They are less likely to choose option A but might still consider B (\(\sqrt{8}\)) or C (\(\sqrt{15}\)) due to misunderstanding how to handle the addition. More students should recognize that the expression cannot be simplified, leaning towards option D. Predicted percentages: A=10% B=25% C=25% D=40%.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students have a solid grasp of the concepts and are less likely to fall into common misconceptions. They should predominantly choose option D, with a few possibly mistakenly selecting B or C due to careless errors or lingering misconceptions. Predicted percentages: A=5% B=10% C=10% D=75%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students have a deep understanding and are highly unlikely to make the mistakes associated with lower levels. They will almost universally choose option D, as they understand that \(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}\) cannot be simplified into a more compact form. Predicted percentages: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=25% C=25% D=40%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=10% D=75%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
