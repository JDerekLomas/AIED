To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question requires students to understand how to express a part of a total when the parts are shared in a given ratio. The ratio given is \(2:5\) for Kate and Isaac, respectively. The total parts of the ratio are \(2 + 5 = 7\) parts. Kate's share is 2 parts out of these 7 parts.

## Step 1: Understanding the Ratio
The ratio \(2:5\) means that for every 2 parts Kate gets, Isaac gets 5 parts. The total number of parts is \(2 + 5 = 7\).

## 2: Expressing Kate's Share as a Fraction of the Total
Kate's share as a fraction of the total is \(\frac{2}{7}\) because she has 2 parts out of the 7 total parts.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: \(\frac{3}{2}\) - This option suggests Kate has more than the whole, which is incorrect.
- B: \(\frac{3}{5}\) - This does not relate directly to the ratio or the total parts.
- C: \(\frac{2}{5}\) - This option might be tempting if students confuse Kate's parts with the total parts incorrectly or misunderstand the ratio.
- D: \(\frac{2}{7}\) - This is the correct answer, representing Kate's 2 parts out of the 7 total parts.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with ratios and fractions. They might choose an option that seems to represent a large portion or incorrectly calculates the fraction. Option A (\(\frac{3}{2}\)) could be appealing due to a misunderstanding of fractions or ratios. 
  - A: 30% (misunderstanding of ratios and fractions)
  - B: 20% (random or incorrect calculation)
  - C: 30% (confusing parts of the ratio)
  - D: 20% (correct but struggling)

- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding but might make simple errors.
  - A: 10% (clear misunderstanding)
  - B: 15% (miscalculation or confusion)
  - C: 25% (not understanding the total parts)
  - D: 50% (correct understanding)

- **Proficient:** These students understand ratios and fractions well.
  - A: 5% (rare mistake)
  - B: 5% (unlikely but possible mistake)
  - C: 10% (occasional confusion)
  - D: 80% (correct understanding)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident in their understanding.
  - A: 0% (unlikely mistake)
  - B: 0% (unlikely mistake)
  - C: 5% (occasional oversight)
  - D: 95% (correct understanding)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=25% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
