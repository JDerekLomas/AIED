## Step 1: Understand the question and the sequence
The question provides a sequence with the 3rd term as 8 and a term-to-term rule of -2. This means each term decreases by 2 to get to the next term.

## 2: Determine the formula for the nth term
Given the term-to-term rule is -2, and if we assume the sequence starts at some term \(a_1\), then the nth term \(a_n\) can be represented as \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times -2\). However, since we're given the 3rd term directly as 8, we can also express the nth term using the 3rd term: \(a_n = 8 + (n-3) \times -2\).

## 3: Calculate the 7th term using the given information
To find the 7th term, we substitute \(n = 7\) into our formula: \(a_7 = 8 + (7-3) \times -2 = 8 + 4 \times -2 = 8 - 8 = 0\).

## 4: Analyze potential misconceptions and student errors
A common misconception might involve misapplying the term-to-term rule or misunderstanding how to use given terms to find other terms. However, this question is relatively straightforward because it directly involves applying the given term-to-term rule to find a term a few steps away.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with applying the term-to-term rule correctly or might not understand how sequences work. They might incorrectly apply addition or subtraction, or not apply the rule at all. Option A (0) seems like a correct calculation for those who understand the sequence, so they might be confused: A=40% (guessing or incorrect calculation), B=20% (random guess), C=20% (another random guess), D=20% (yet another guess).
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of sequences but might make simple arithmetic errors. They should mostly get it right but could be tempted by incorrect calculations: A=60% (correct), B=15% (error), C=15% (error), D=10% (misunderstanding).
- **Proficient:** These students understand sequences well and are less likely to make errors in calculation or applying rules. They should mostly choose A: A=80% (correct), B=5% (minor error), C=10% (minor error), D=5% (unlikely but possible misinterpretation).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand sequences but are also good at complex problems. They should almost universally get it right: A=95% (correct), B=2% (error), C=2% (error), D=1% (very unlikely mistake).

## 6: Translate predictions into the required format
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
- basic: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
- proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
- advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
