To approach this question, let's analyze the definitions and characteristics of an arithmetic sequence and how students at different levels might perceive it.

An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between any two successive members is constant. For Tom's sequence: \(5, 8, 11, 14, 17, \ldots\), the common difference is \(3\), which makes it an arithmetic sequence. For Katie's sequence: \(5, 15, 45, 135, 405, \ldots\), the differences between successive terms are \(10, 30, 90, 270, \ldots\), which are not constant, indicating it's not an arithmetic sequence but a geometric sequence.

Now, let's assess how students at different ability levels might respond:

### Below Basic
Students at this level might struggle with understanding what defines an arithmetic sequence. They might confuse it with other types of sequences or not fully grasp the concept of a common difference.

- A) Only Tom: \(30\%\)
- B) Only Katie: \(20\%\)
- C) Both Tom and Katie: \(20\%\)
- D) Neither is correct: \(30\%\)

These students might randomly select an option or choose based on a superficial understanding.

### Basic
At this level, students have a basic understanding of arithmetic sequences but might make mistakes in identifying them, especially if the sequence is presented in an unconventional way or if they confuse arithmetic sequences with geometric sequences.

- A) Only Tom: \(60\%\)
- B) Only Katie: \(15\%\)
- C) Both Tom and Katie: \(10\%\)
- D) Neither is correct: \(15\%\)

Students here are more likely to correctly identify Tom's sequence but might be misled by Katie's sequence into thinking it's an arithmetic sequence.

### Proficient
Proficient students have a solid grasp of arithmetic sequences and can usually identify them correctly. They are less likely to confuse arithmetic sequences with geometric sequences.

- A) Only Tom: \(80\%\)
- B) Only Katie: \(5\%\)
- C) Both Tom and Katie: \(5\%\)
- D) Neither is correct: \(10\%\)

These students understand the definition and can apply it to both sequences correctly.

### Advanced
Advanced students not only understand the definitions but can also analyze sequences critically. They are highly unlikely to make basic mistakes.

- A) Only Tom: \(90\%\)
- B) Only Katie: \(0\%\)
- C) Both Tom and Katie: \(0\%\)
- D) Neither is correct: \(10\%\)

These students can easily identify both sequences and understand why only Tom's sequence qualifies as an arithmetic sequence.

Given the straightforward nature of Tom's sequence and the clear distinction from Katie's sequence, most students, even at lower levels, can correctly identify Tom's sequence. However, the confusion is more likely with Katie's sequence, which resembles a geometric sequence, a common mistake in sequence identification.

So, in summary:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=0% D=10%
