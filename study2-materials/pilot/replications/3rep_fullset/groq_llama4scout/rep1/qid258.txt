To approach this question, let's first analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie and evaluate their correctness.

Tom says \( 15 \times 42 = 154 \times 2 \). Let's check if this is true:
\( 15 \times 42 = 630 \)
\( 154 \times 2 = 308 \)
So, Tom is incorrect.

Katie says \( 15 \times 42 = (15 \times 4) + (15 \times 2) \). Let's check if this is true:
\( 15 \times 42 = 630 \)
\( (15 \times 4) + (15 \times 2) = 60 + 30 = 90 \)
So, Katie is also incorrect.

Given that both Tom and Katie are incorrect, the correct answer is D) Neither is correct.

Now, let's consider the difficulty level and the likelihood of students choosing each option based on their ability levels:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic multiplication and addition facts, and they might not fully understand the concepts of multiplication strategies. They are more likely to guess or choose an option without thorough calculation.
  - A) Only Tom: Some might think Tom's method could work, but it's unlikely they recognize Katie's as incorrect without calculation.
  - B) Only Katie: Similar to Tom, some might think Katie's could be right.
  - C) Both Tom and Katie: This would require them to mistakenly believe both are correct.
  - D) Neither is correct: This requires understanding that both methods are flawed.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a better grasp of basic operations but may still struggle with applying them in different contexts or evaluating the correctness of given strategies.
  
- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid understanding of multiplication and can likely see the flaws in both Tom's and Katie's strategies with minimal calculation.

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the strategies but can also quickly evaluate the effectiveness and correctness of the strategies proposed by Tom and Katie.

Given these considerations:

**Below Basic**: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
**Basic**: A=20% B=20% C=15% D=45%
**Proficient**: A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
**Advanced**: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%

So, the response in the required format is:

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=15% D=45%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=5% D=75%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
