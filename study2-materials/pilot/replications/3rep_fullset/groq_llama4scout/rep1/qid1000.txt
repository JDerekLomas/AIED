## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests.
The question asks students to simplify \( \frac{1-t}{t-1} \), which can be a test for the misconception that \( \frac{a}{b} = -\frac{b}{a} \) or not recognizing that \( 1 - t = -(t - 1) \). This means students might incorrectly simplify it to \( -1 \) if they catch the relationship between \( 1-t \) and \( t-1 \), or they might leave it as is or incorrectly simplify it.

## 2: Consider the common errors or misconceptions.
A common misconception could be simplifying directly without noticing the negative sign relationship, i.e., thinking \( \frac{1-t}{t-1} \) simplifies to \( 1 \) or \( t \) without properly handling the negative signs.

## 3: Analyze the options based on likely student responses.
- Option A (\( t \)) might appeal to students who mistakenly think the \( t \) terms cancel out directly.
- Option B (\( -1 \)) could be chosen by students who recognize \( 1-t = -(t-1) \), thus \( \frac{1-t}{t-1} = \frac{-(t-1)}{t-1} = -1 \).
- Option C (\( 1 \)) seems unlikely as it suggests \( 1-t = t-1 \), which is not true.
- Option D (Does not simplify) might be chosen by students who see that \( \frac{1-t}{t-1} \) can actually be simplified to \( -1 \), recognizing the factor relationship.

## 4: Predict the performance based on ability levels.
- **Below_basic**: These students might struggle with algebraic manipulations and could mistakenly choose \( A \) or \( C \) due to not understanding how to handle the expression. Some might choose \( B \) if they've seen similar manipulations before. \( D \) seems less likely as they might not recognize that it can be simplified.
- **Basic**: Students at this level might start to recognize that \( 1-t \) and \( t-1 \) are opposites, leading them to choose \( B \) (\( -1 \)). Some might still make errors, choosing \( A \) or \( C \).
- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to correctly simplify the expression to \( -1 \) (Option B), recognizing \( \frac{1-t}{t-1} = -1 \). They are less likely to choose \( A \), \( C \), or \( D \) as they understand the algebraic manipulation.
- **Advanced**: These students will likely choose \( B \) (\( -1 \)) as they are comfortable with algebraic expressions and recognize that \( \frac{1-t}{t-1} = -1 \). They are unlikely to choose \( A \), \( C \), or \( D \) as they are confident in their algebraic manipulations.

## 5: Assign percentages based on predicted performance.
Given the analysis:
- **Below_basic**: A=40% (incorrect cancellation), B=20% (recognize relationship), C=30% (incorrect equality), D=10% (don't know).
- **Basic**: A=30%, B=40%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: A=5%, B=90%, C=3%, D=2%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
