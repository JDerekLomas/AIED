To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and how students at different levels might respond.

The question tests the understanding of a situation where there is a fixed call-out fee plus a variable charge per hour. The correct formula to calculate the total cost \(C\) for \(n\) hours, given a call-out fee of \(£40\) and an hourly rate of \(£15\), is \(C = 40 + 15n\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
Students might have a misconception if they forget to add the call-out fee to the hourly rate multiplied by the number of hours. This could lead them to choose options that either omit the call-out fee (A), incorrectly combine the fees (B), or misplace the call-out fee (D).

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \(C = 15n\), ignores the call-out fee entirely. This could appeal to students who forget about the fixed cost.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, \(C = 55n\), suggests a combined rate but doesn't account for the call-out fee separately. It might seem plausible to students who are trying to combine costs but don't understand the structure.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C, \(C = 40 + 15n\), correctly adds the call-out fee to the product of the hourly rate and the number of hours. This is the correct formula.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \(C = 40n + 15\), incorrectly suggests that the call-out fee is multiplied by the number of hours and then added to a fixed \(£15\), which doesn't make sense in this context.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with formulating equations from word problems. They are likely to choose A (\(C = 15n\)) because it directly relates to the hourly rate without considering the complexity of adding a fixed fee (30% A, 20% B, 30% C, 20% D).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have some understanding but may still make errors. They might lean towards A or B due to misunderstandings (20% A, 25% B, 40% C, 15% D).
- **Proficient**: Proficient students are more likely to understand the structure of the problem and choose C. They might still consider A or B due to quick mental math or oversight (5% A, 10% B, 80% C, 5% D).
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to choose C with high confidence. Errors might be minimal (0% A, 5% B, 90% C, 5% D).

## 7: Finalizing Predictions
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **below_basic**: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
- **basic**: A=20% B=25% C=40% D=15%
- **proficient**: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
- **advanced**: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
