To solve this question, let's first simplify \(\sqrt{75}\) to see if it can be expressed as \(n\sqrt{3}\).

## Step 1: Simplify \(\sqrt{75}\)
\(\sqrt{75} = \sqrt{25 \times 3} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{3} = 5\sqrt{3}\).

## 2: Identify \(n\)
From the simplification, it's clear that \(n = 5\) because \(\sqrt{75} = 5\sqrt{3}\).

## 3: Analyze the Question for Potential Errors
The question tests the ability to simplify a square root and recognize the form \(n\sqrt{3}\). A common misconception might involve not fully simplifying the square root or incorrectly handling the square root of a product. However, given that 75 is a product of 25 (a perfect square) and 3, this question may not trigger as many errors as one where the numbers don't simplify so neatly.

## 4: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with simplifying \(\sqrt{75}\) or might not recognize that \(\sqrt{25} = 5\). They could incorrectly leave \(\sqrt{75}\) as is or try to force it into a form without proper simplification, potentially leading to guesses like B, C, or D. However, given the straightforward nature of the simplification, a significant portion might still guess A or make a calculation error leading to one of the other options. 
  - A: 20% (correct, but let's assume they might not get it)
  - B: 15% ( incorrect, could be from miscalculation)
  - C: 10% (incorrect, could be from miscalculation or incorrect handling of square roots)
  - D: 55% (likely incorrect, could be random guesses)

- **Basic:** Students here should have a good grasp of basic algebra and square roots. They might still make simple mistakes but should recognize \(5\sqrt{3}\) easily.
  - A: 70% (correct)
  - B: 10% (incorrect)
  - C: 5% (incorrect)
  - D: 15% (incorrect)

- **Proficient:** These students should easily simplify \(\sqrt{75}\) to \(5\sqrt{3}\) and identify \(n = 5\).
  - A: 90% (correct)
  - B: 5% (incorrect)
  - C: 2% (incorrect)
  - D: 3% (incorrect)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level should not only simplify correctly but also understand the underlying mathematics well.
  - A: 95% (correct)
  - B: 2% (incorrect)
  - C: 1% (incorrect)
  - D: 2% (incorrect)

Given these considerations, here's the formatted prediction:

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
