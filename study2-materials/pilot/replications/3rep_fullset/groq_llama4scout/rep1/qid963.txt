To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question on the correct working out for $72 \times 36$, let's consider what the question entails and common misconceptions or areas of difficulty.

The question requires students to identify the correct long multiplication process for $72 \times 36$. This involves understanding place value, multiplication facts, and the procedure for long multiplication.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions and Difficulties
- A common misconception might involve errors in multiplying the numbers or adding the partial products.
- Difficulty could arise from accurately following the long multiplication algorithm, especially when dealing with carries or incorrectly adding zeros.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- **Option A** shows incorrect working and an incorrect final answer due to mistakes in both rows of working.
- **Option B** presents correct working for the first row but incorrect working for the second row, leading to an incorrect final answer.
- **Option C** demonstrates correct working but results in an incorrect final answer due to a miscalculation (likely a mistake in adding the partial products or incorrect placement of the decimal/zeros).
- **Option D** displays both correct working and a correct final answer.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
### below_basic:
At this level, students might struggle significantly with long multiplication. They might not accurately perform the multiplication or correctly add the rows. Given the overt errors in A and B, and a likely straightforward calculation error in C, students might pick A or B due to not understanding the process well, or they might mistakenly pick C if they can do the multiplication but not the final addition correctly.

- A: 30% 
- B: 25% 
- C: 20% 
- D: 25%

### basic:
Students at this level have a basic understanding but may make procedural errors. They are likely to recognize the general process but could be tricked by obviously incorrect options or make simple arithmetic mistakes.

- A: 20% 
- B: 20% 
- C: 15% 
- D: 45%

### proficient:
Proficient students understand the long multiplication process well but might make occasional errors, especially if under pressure or not fully checking their work.

- A: 5% 
- B: 10% 
- C: 10% 
- D: 75%

### advanced:
Advanced students are expected to have a strong grasp of long multiplication, minimizing errors in calculation and process.

- A: 0% 
- B: 5% 
- C: 5% 
- D: 90%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=15% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=10% D=75%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=5% D=90%
