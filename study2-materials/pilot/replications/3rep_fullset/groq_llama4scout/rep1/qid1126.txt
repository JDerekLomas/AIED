To approach this question, let's first analyze the content and potential pitfalls.

The question involves finding angles \( x \) and \( y \) using properties of parallel lines and transversals, specifically focusing on alternate angles. 

- **Alternate angles** are equal when two lines are parallel and cut by a transversal. 
- The given diagram shows parallel lines and two transversals, with some angles provided.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks to identify the incorrect step in Jane's workings for finding angles \( x \) and \( y \). 

## Step 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A states \( x = 103\degree \) as alternate angles. If \( x \) is indeed an alternate angle to \( 103\degree \), this step would be correct.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B states \( y = 65\degree \) as alternate angles. Similarly, if \( y \) is an alternate angle to \( 65\degree \), this step would also be correct.

## 4: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could be confusing alternate angles with corresponding angles or not properly identifying which angles are alternate. However, the specific angles given (\( 103\degree \) and \( 65\degree \)) and their relation to \( x \) and \( y \) must be examined closely.

## 5: Considering Student Errors
Students might struggle if they:
- Misidentify the angles (e.g., using corresponding angles instead of alternate).
- Make calculation errors.
- Don't properly apply the properties of parallel lines and transversals.

## 6: Assessing Difficulty Level
Given that the question directly points to specific steps and asks for an identification of an incorrect step based on a clear property (alternate angles), it seems straightforward. However, the actual difficulty lies in how well students can apply this property correctly to the given diagram and angles.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle to understand the properties of parallel lines and transversals. They might incorrectly identify alternate angles or not understand the concept at all. Thus, they could easily choose A, B, or D incorrectly. \( A = 30\% \), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 20\% \).
- **Basic**: At this level, students have a grasp of basic geometric properties but might still make simple mistakes. They might correctly identify one step but not the other. \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 50\% \), \( D = 10\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to accurately apply geometric principles. They should easily identify the correct steps. \( A = 5\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 85\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can quickly apply principles. They are less likely to make errors. \( A = 2\% \), \( B = 2\% \), \( C = 95\% \), \( D = 1\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=30% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
