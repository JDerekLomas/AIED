To approach this question, let's analyze the content and the potential misconceptions.

The question asks students to simplify the fraction \( \frac{45}{60} \). A common misconception in fraction simplification is to reduce the numerator and denominator by a certain factor but not necessarily the greatest common divisor (GCD). Another error could be not simplifying at all or incorrectly simplifying.

## Step 1: Identify the Simplification Process
To simplify \( \frac{45}{60} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 45 and 60. The factors of 45 are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45 and of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60. The greatest common factor they share is 15.

## 2: Apply the Simplification
Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 15: \( \frac{45 \div 15}{60 \div 15} = \frac{3}{4} \).

## 3: Analyze Potential Misconceptions and Errors
- A common error would be to not simplify or to simplify incorrectly. For instance, some might divide both by 5 (a common factor) to get \( \frac{9}{12} \) (option A), which is a partially correct step but not fully simplified.
- Another error could be suggesting it cannot be simplified (D), which would indicate a lack of understanding of finding GCD.
- Option C (\( \frac{21}{28} \)) seems unrelated and would likely be a distractor for those who either do not understand the concept or make a significant calculation error.

## 4: Predict Student Responses Based on Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with finding the GCD or understanding the concept of simplification. They might choose D (Cannot be simplified) because they don't know how to simplify, or they might choose A if they've managed to divide by a common factor but not the greatest one. \( \frac{21}{28} \) seems unlikely as it requires knowledge of another fraction. So, below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%.
- **Basic:** These students understand the concept but might make errors in calculation or choose an option that shows partial understanding. They are likely to choose B if they understand the concept well but might also choose A if they only divide by 5. So, basic: A=40% B=50% C=5% D=5%.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level are expected to simplify fractions easily. They should predominantly choose B. Errors might occur but are less likely. So, proficient: A=10% B=85% C=0% D=5%.
- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the concept but are also likely to have a strong grasp of factors and simplification. They should nearly all choose B. So, advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=40% B=50% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=85% C=0% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
