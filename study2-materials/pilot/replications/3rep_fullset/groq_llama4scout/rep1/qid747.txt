## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks students to determine the region in which the quadratic function \( y=(x+4)(x-2) \) belongs, based on two conditions: having a line of symmetry at \( x = 3 \) and having a \( y \)-intercept that is negative. The function can be rewritten as \( y = x^2 + 2x - 8 \) to facilitate analysis.

## 2: Analyzing the Line of Symmetry
The line of symmetry for a quadratic function \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). For \( y = x^2 + 2x - 8 \), \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \), so the line of symmetry is \( x = -\frac{2}{2*1} = -1 \). This means the function does not have a line of symmetry at \( x = 3 \).

## 3: Analyzing the Y-Intercept
The \( y \)-intercept of a function is found by letting \( x = 0 \). For \( y = x^2 + 2x - 8 \), when \( x = 0 \), \( y = -8 \), which is negative.

## 4: Evaluating the Regions
- The set on the left is 'Line of symmetry at \( x = 3 \)'.
- The set on the right is 'y intercept is negative'.
Given that the function's line of symmetry is at \( x = -1 \) (not \( x = 3 \)) and its \( y \)-intercept is \( -8 \) (negative), the function belongs to the region where the \( y \)-intercept is negative but not where the line of symmetry is at \( x = 3 \).

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the properties of quadratic functions and the definitions of line of symmetry and \( y \)-intercept. They might incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the conditions. Expect a high chance of choosing A or D due to confusion. \( A=30\% \) \( B=10\% \) \( C=40\% \) \( D=20\% \)
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make calculation errors or not fully understand the implications of the function's properties. They might correctly identify the \( y \)-intercept but struggle with the line of symmetry. \( A=15\% \) \( B=10\% \) \( C=60\% \) \( D=15\% \)
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately calculate the line of symmetry and \( y \)-intercept. They would know the function doesn't have a line of symmetry at \( x = 3 \) but does have a negative \( y \)-intercept, placing it in region C. \( A=5\% \) \( B=5\% \) \( C=80\% \) \( D=10\% \)
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply their knowledge accurately. They would easily identify that the line of symmetry is not at \( x = 3 \) and the \( y \)-intercept is negative, confidently placing the function in region C. \( A=0\% \) \( B=0\% \) \( C=90\% \) \( D=10\% \)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=10% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
