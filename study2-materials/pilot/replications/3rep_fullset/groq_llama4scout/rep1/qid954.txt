To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( 4514 - 328 = \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it might pose.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires the subtraction of 328 from 4514, which is a straightforward calculation but can be prone to errors if students are not careful with their arithmetic, especially if they are not confident in their subtraction skills or if they make mistakes in lining up the numbers or carrying over.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions or Errors
A common error in subtraction involves misaligning numbers or failing to borrow correctly. However, given the numbers here (4514 and 328), and considering the answer choices provided, we should think about how likely students are to make significant errors.

## 3: Analyzing Answer Choices
- A: \( 4196 \)
- B: \( 1234 \)
- C: \( 4214 \)
- D: \( 4186 \)

Let's calculate the correct answer: \( 4514 - 328 = 4186 \).

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle significantly with the subtraction. They might not even attempt to calculate and could guess randomly or choose an answer that seems "reasonable" to them. Given the large difference between 4514 and 328, option B seems too low and might be less likely, but without calculation skills, any option could be a guess. Let's assume A=20%, B=30%, C=20%, D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level can perform basic arithmetic operations but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to get the correct answer or make a simple arithmetic mistake. The correct answer is D, so let's assume A=15%, B=10%, C=15%, D=60%.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to perform the calculation accurately. However, some might make minor errors. Given their proficiency, let's assume A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are highly confident in their arithmetic skills and are less likely to make errors. Let's assume A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

## 5: Converting to Requested Format
Given the predictions:
- below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- basic: A=15% B=10% C=15% D=60%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=15% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
