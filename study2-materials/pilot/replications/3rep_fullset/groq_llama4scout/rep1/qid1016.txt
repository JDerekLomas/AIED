To approach this question, let's first analyze the statements given and understand what is being tested. The question revolves around algebraic expressions and inequalities, specifically testing the understanding of how to substitute a value into an expression and compare the results.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks us to evaluate the truth of three statements when \( n = 1.5 \): 
- \( 5n > n + 5 \)
- \( 5n < n + 5 \)
- \( 5n = n + 5 \)
And to consider if there's not enough information.

## 2: Evaluating Statement A
Let's substitute \( n = 1.5 \) into each statement to assess its validity.
- For \( 5n > n + 5 \): 
  \( 5(1.5) > 1.5 + 5 \)
  \( 7.5 > 6.5 \)
  This statement is true.

## 3: Evaluating Statement B
- For \( 5n < n + 5 \):
  Given that Statement A is true, Statement B must be false.

## 4: Evaluating Statement C
- For \( 5n = n + 5 \):
  \( 5(1.5) = 1.5 + 5 \)
  \( 7.5 = 6.5 \)
  This statement is false.

## 5: Evaluating Statement D
- For "Not enough information":
  We have all the necessary information to evaluate the statements (the value of \( n \) and the statements themselves), so this option does not apply.

## 6: Analyzing Potential Student Errors
The potential misconception here could involve incorrect substitution or comparison. However, given that \( n = 1.5 \) is a straightforward value to work with and the statements are simple to evaluate, the main challenge might be in ensuring students correctly perform the arithmetic.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substitution and comparison. They might incorrectly solve the inequalities or make calculation errors. Given the simplicity of the arithmetic, \( A = 40\% \) (getting the right answer through luck or correct calculation), \( B = 30\% \) (mistaking the inequality sign), \( C = 20\% \) (incorrectly solving the equation), \( D = 10\% \) (not understanding what's being asked).
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to substitute \( n = 1.5 \) and perform basic arithmetic. They might still make some errors in inequalities. So, \( A = 60\% \), \( B = 25\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
- **Proficient**: These students should easily substitute and compare. Errors would be minimal. Thus, \( A = 80\% \), \( B = 15\% \), \( C = 3\% \), \( D = 2\% \).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level would likely get it right with ease, understanding both the substitution and the implications of the inequalities. So, \( A = 95\% \), \( B = 4\% \), \( C = 1\% \), \( D = 0\% \).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=25% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=4% C=1% D=0%
