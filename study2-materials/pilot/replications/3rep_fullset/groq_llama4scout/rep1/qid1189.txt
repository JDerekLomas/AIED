## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a horizontal blue bar divided into 5 equal sections, with each section labelled with \( \mathrm{M} \). A curly bracket indicates that 4 of these sections sum to 420. The task is to find the value of \( \mathrm{M} \).

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
A common misconception might be to consider the total length or to misunderstand the proportion of the bar that 4 sections represent. However, the question explicitly states that 4 sections equal 420, which should guide students to the correct calculation without invoking misconceptions about fractions of the whole.

## 3: Solving the Question
To find \( \mathrm{M} \), if 4 sections equal 420, and there are 5 equal sections in total, we divide 420 by 4 to find the value of one section. So, \( 420 \div 4 = 105 \). This means each section, labelled \( \mathrm{M} \), equals 105.

## 4: Analyzing Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with division or understanding the relationship between the sections. They might choose \( \mathrm{D} \) (1680) because it seems like a total or confuse the operations, or they might not understand the question at all, leading to random guesses.
- **Basic:** Basic level students should be able to understand the concept of equal parts and perform simple division. They are likely to calculate \( 420 \div 4 \) correctly to find \( \mathrm{M} = 105 \), so \( \mathrm{A} = 105 \) should be a popular choice.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students will easily solve this by dividing 420 by 4, confirming \( \mathrm{M} = 105 \). They are less likely to make careless mistakes.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will also quickly solve for \( \mathrm{M} \) and are unlikely to consider incorrect options.

## 5: Predicting Student Choices
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation:
- **Below Basic:** Might have a higher chance of choosing \( \mathrm{D} \) (incorrectly thinking the total for all sections) or guessing randomly. \( \mathrm{A=40\%} \), \( \mathrm{B=10\%} \), \( \mathrm{C=20\%} \), \( \mathrm{D=30\%} \)
- **Basic:** Should mostly choose \( \mathrm{A} \), with a few possibly misinterpreting. \( \mathrm{A=80\%} \), \( \mathrm{B=5\%} \), \( \mathrm{C=10\%} \), \( \mathrm{D=5\%} \)
- **Proficient:** Will accurately choose \( \mathrm{A} \). \( \mathrm{A=95\%} \), \( \mathrm{B=2\%} \), \( \mathrm{C=2\%} \), \( \mathrm{D=1\%} \)
- **Advanced:** Will also accurately choose \( \mathrm{A} \), with almost no errors. \( \mathrm{A=99\%} \), \( \mathrm{B=0.5\%} \), \( \mathrm{C=0.5\%} \), \( \mathrm{D=0\%} \)

## 6: Finalizing Predictions
Based on the steps above, refining the estimates:
- **below_basic:** \( \mathrm{A=40\%} \) \( \mathrm{B=10\%} \) \( \mathrm{C=20\%} \) \( \mathrm{D=30\%} \)
- **basic:** \( \mathrm{A=80\%} \) \( \mathrm{B=5\%} \) \( \mathrm{C=10\%} \) \( \mathrm{D=5\%} \)
- **proficient:** \( \mathrm{A=95\%} \) \( \mathrm{B=2\%} \) \( \mathrm{C=2\%} \) \( \mathrm{D=1\%} \)
- **advanced:** \( \mathrm{A=99\%} \) \( \mathrm{B=0.5\%} \) \( \mathrm{C=0.5\%} \) \( \mathrm{D=0\%} \)

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.5% D=0%
