To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the sequence provided.

The sequence shows:
- Pattern 1: 1 rectangle with 6 circles surrounding it.
- Pattern 2: 2 rectangles with 10 circles surrounding it.
- Pattern 3: 3 rectangles with 14 circles surrounding it.

The task is to predict the number of circles in the 5th term without drawing it.

## Step 1: Identify the Pattern
First, let's identify the pattern. The number of rectangles increases by 1 for each term (1, 2, 3, ...), and the number of circles increases by 4 each time (6, 10, 14, ...). 

## 2: Analyze the Sequence of Circles
The sequence of the number of circles is 6, 10, 14. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4.

## 3: Extrapolate to the 5th Term
To find the number of circles in the 5th term:
- 1st term: 6 circles
- 2nd term: 6 + 4 = 10 circles
- 3rd term: 10 + 4 = 14 circles
- 4th term: 14 + 4 = 18 circles
- 5th term: 18 + 4 = 22 circles

## 4: Consider Student Errors
Students might make errors if they don't recognize the pattern or if they incorrectly apply it. A common misconception could be adding the wrong number or not adding enough terms.

## 5: Predict Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not recognize the pattern or might add incorrectly. They might guess or choose an option that seems "reasonable" without calculation. Option A (30) seems too high, B (18) could be a plausible guess if they stop at the 4th term, C (24) could be a mistaken calculation, and D (22) is the correct answer.

- **Basic:** Students here might understand simple patterns but could struggle with applying them accurately, especially if the sequence isn't immediately obvious. They are likely to choose B (18) if they mistakenly stop at the 4th term or guess.

- **Proficient:** These students should easily recognize the pattern and calculate the 5th term correctly as 22 circles. They are less likely to choose incorrect options.

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only recognize the pattern but also understand the underlying mathematical structure. They are highly likely to choose the correct option, D (22), and might even derive a general formula for the nth term.

## 6: Estimate Percentages
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (wild guess), B=30% (stops at 4th term), C=20% (incorrect calculation), D=30% (somehow gets it right or guesses correctly).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=40% (common mistake), C=20%, D=30%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=10%, C=5%, D=80%.
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

The best answer is D.
