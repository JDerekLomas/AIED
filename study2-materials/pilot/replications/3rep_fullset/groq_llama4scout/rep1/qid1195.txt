To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \(2 \times 3^{2} =\), let's consider the common misconceptions and the order of operations.

The expression \(2 \times 3^{2}\) requires the application of the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). According to BIDMAS, indices are evaluated before multiplication.

## Step 1: Evaluating \(3^{2}\)
\(3^{2} = 9\), so the expression simplifies to \(2 \times 9\).

## 2: Multiplying
\(2 \times 9 = 18\).

The correct answer is A: \(18\).

## 3: Common Misconceptions
A common mistake is to perform operations in the wrong order, such as calculating \(2 \times 3 = 6\) and then \(6^{2} = 36\), or simply adding or multiplying without applying the correct order of operations.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might not fully understand the order of operations or might not be able to calculate \(3^{2}\) correctly. They might choose B (\(12\)) if they calculate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) and then incorrectly apply an operation, or they might choose C (\(36\)) if they mistakenly calculate \((2 \times 3)^{2}\). Given the simplicity of the numbers, some might still guess or calculate \(2 \times 3^{2}\) as \(2 \times 3 \times 2 = 12\), leading to:
  - A = 20% (correct calculation, surprising for this level)
  - B = 40% (incorrect order of operations, \(2 \times 3 = 6\), then \(6 + 2 \times 3 = 12\), or similar simple errors)
  - C = 30% (mistake like \((2 \times 3)^{2} = 6^{2} = 36\))
  - D = 10% (random or calculation error)

- **Basic**: Students here have a basic understanding but might still struggle with applying the order of operations consistently:
  - A = 50% (correct application of order of operations)
  - B = 30% (performing \(2 \times 3 = 6\) then not squaring)
  - C = 15% (thinking \((2*3)^2\))
  - D = 5% (miscalculation)

- **Proficient**: Students at this level are expected to apply the order of operations correctly:
  - A = 80% (correct calculation)
  - B = 15% (some struggle with order of operations)
  - C = 4% (occasional mistake with indices)
  - D = 1% (rare miscalculation)

- **Advanced**: These students are likely to get it right, as they have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts:
  - A = 95% (correct calculation)
  - B = 3% (minor error)
  - C = 1% (rare mistake)
  - D = 1% (very unlikely)

Given these analyses, here is the formatted prediction:

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=30% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=15% C=4% D=1%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
