To approach this question, let's first analyze the content and potential pitfalls for students at different ability levels.

The question requires students to factorize two quadratic expressions and verify the correctness of the factorized forms provided by Tom and Katie.

1. **Tom's expression:** \( x^{2}+5 x+6 \equiv(x+3)(x+2) \)
   - To verify, we expand \((x+3)(x+2)\) to get \(x^2 + 2x + 3x + 6 = x^2 + 5x + 6\), which matches the original expression. So, Tom is correct.

2. **Katie's expression:** \( x^{2}-5 x-6 \equiv(x-3)(x-2) \)
   - To verify, we expand \((x-3)(x-2)\) to get \(x^2 - 2x - 3x + 6 = x^2 - 5x + 6\), which does not match Katie's original expression of \(x^2 - 5x - 6\). So, Katie is incorrect.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is that only Tom is correct, which corresponds to option A.

Now, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic factorization and verification. They might not correctly expand or compare the expressions.
  - A=40% (some recognition of correct factorization but might be confused)
  - B=20% (might mistakenly think Katie is correct due to not fully understanding factorization)
  - C=20% (might think both are correct due to lack of understanding)
  - D=20% (might think neither is correct due to confusion)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebraic manipulations but might make careless mistakes.
  - A=60% (understand and correctly verify Tom's expression)
  - B=15% (might still be confused about Katie's expression)
  - C=10% (less likely to think both are correct with some understanding)
  - D=15% (might question both due to some level of understanding)

- **Proficient:** Students at this level are confident in their algebraic manipulations and can accurately verify expressions.
  - A=80% (clearly understand and verify Tom's correctness)
  - B=5% (unlikely to mistakenly think Katie is correct)
  - C=5% (unlikely to think both are correct given accurate verification)
  - D=10% (some might still question due to double-checking)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can quickly identify correct factorizations.
  - A=95% (immediately recognize Tom's correctness and can prove it)
  - B=0% (unlikely to mistakenly support Katie)
  - C=0% (know both cannot be correct given verification)
  - D=5% (extremely rare to doubt correct information)

Given these considerations, here's the prediction:

below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=95% B=0% C=0% D=5%
