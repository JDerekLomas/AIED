To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question about finding the gradient of the line \(5x + 3y = 15\), let's consider the common misconceptions and the mathematical process involved.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to find the gradient of a line given in the general form of a linear equation, \(5x + 3y = 15\). To find the gradient, the equation needs to be rearranged into the slope-intercept form, \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the gradient.

## 2: Rearranging the Equation
Rearrange \(5x + 3y = 15\) to solve for \(y\):
\[3y = -5x + 15\]
\[y = -\frac{5}{3}x + 5\]
So, the gradient (\(m\)) of the line is \(-\frac{5}{3}\).

## 3: Identifying Misconceptions and Difficulties
A common misconception might involve incorrectly rearranging the equation or misunderstanding the signs. For instance, students might incorrectly identify the gradient as \(\frac{5}{3}\) or \(-\frac{3}{5}\) if they mistakenly swap the coefficients or misinterpret the signs.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with rearranging the equation or understanding the concept of gradient. They might choose \(A = 5\) or \(C = \frac{5}{3}\) due to a lack of understanding of how to rearrange the equation or identify the gradient. \(A = 40\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(D = 20\%\).
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make simple algebraic mistakes. They are more likely to choose \(D = -\frac{5}{3}\) but could be tempted by \(C = \frac{5}{3}\) if they forget to change the sign. \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(D = 55\%\).
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to correctly rearrange the equation and identify the gradient. However, a few might still choose \(C = \frac{5}{3}\) due to oversight. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 2\%\), \(C = 10\%\), \(D = 83\%\).
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of algebraic manipulation and the concept of gradient. They are less likely to make mistakes. \(A = 1\%\), \(B = 1\%\), \(C = 2\%\), \(D = 96\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=5% C=20% D=55%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=10% D=83%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=2% D=96%
