To solve this, let's analyze the addition pyramid and the conditions given for \(f\) and \(g\).

The bottom row of the pyramid contains a star, an empty box, and \(2g\). The middle row contains \(4f + 6g\) on the left and an empty box on the right. The top row is empty.

## Step 1: Determine the relationship between the numbers in the pyramid.
To find out who is correct, we need to work out the values that could lead to the top box being empty (or zero, assuming that's what "empty" implies in this context).

## 2: Express the middle row in terms of \(f\), \(g\), and the star.
The left box in the middle row is \(4f + 6g\), and it must be the sum of the star and the empty box below it. However, without a direct value for the star or the empty box, we look at the right side for more clues.

## 3: Analyze the right side of the pyramid.
The right box in the bottom row is \(2g\), and it combines with another empty box to form the right box in the middle row. Since the right box in the middle row is empty, the two values that combine to make it must sum to 0. Therefore, \(2g + \text{empty box} = 0\), implying the empty box is \(-2g\).

## 4: Apply the same logic to the left side of the pyramid.
The left box in the middle row is \(4f + 6g\), and it results from adding the star and the empty box below it (\(-2g\)). So, \(\text{star} - 2g = 4f + 6g\).

## 5: Solve for \(f\) and \(g\).
Rearrange the equation to find \(\text{star} = 4f + 8g\).

## 6: Evaluate Jo's claim (\(f\)).
For Jo to be correct, \(f\) must satisfy the condition that leads to the top box being empty. The top box is the sum of the two boxes in the middle row. The right box in the middle row is \(0\) (as deduced), and the left box is \(4f + 6g\). So, \(4f + 6g + 0 = 0\), which simplifies to \(4f + 6g = 0\).

## 7: Evaluate Paul's claim (\(g\)).
For Paul to be correct, \(g\) must lead to the top box being \(0\). If \(g = 0\), then from \(4f + 6g = 0\), \(4f = 0\), which means \(f = 0\). This satisfies the equation but we need to check if it aligns with the original conditions.

## 8: Assess the validity of \(f\) and \(g\).
- For \(f = 0\) and \(g = 0\), the star must also be \(0\) (from \(\text{star} = 4f + 8g\)), which could potentially work but let's see if both can actually fit.

## 9: Checking Jo's and Paul's statements.
Given \(4f + 6g = 0\), let's assume \(g = - \frac{2}{3}f\). For \(g\) to work, it must satisfy the conditions leading to an empty top box. For \(f\), similarly, it needs to fit.

## 10: Final assessment for student responses.
Given the complexity and algebraic manipulation required, let's assess the likely student responses based on ability levels:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic expressions and substituting values. They might incorrectly assume \(f\) or \(g\) could be any number without checking the conditions. \(A = 30\%\), \(B = 20\%\), \(C = 20\%\), \(D = 30\%\).

- **Basic**: At this level, students can handle simple equations but might struggle with the relationship between \(f\) and \(g\). \(A = 20\%\), \(B = 25\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(D = 25\%\).

- **Proficient**: These students can solve linear equations and understand relationships between variables. They would likely find that both \(f\) and \(g\) can satisfy the conditions under specific values. \(A = 10\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(C = 70\%\), \(D = 10\%\).

- **Advanced**: Students at this level can quickly solve and understand the implications of the equations. They would likely see that both are possible under certain conditions. \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 5\%\), \(C = 85\%\), \(D = 5\%\).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20%
