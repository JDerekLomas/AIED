To approach this question, let's first analyze the methods proposed by Tom and Katie for finding \(40\%\) of an amount and then assess their validity.

Tom suggests: \(40\% = \frac{40}{100} = \frac{2}{5}\). To find \(40\%\) of an amount \(X\), you calculate \(\frac{2}{5}X\), which can also be expressed as \(X \div 5 \times 2\). 

Katie suggests: To find \(40\%\), you divide by \(5\) and multiply by \(2\), which directly translates to \(X \div 5 \times 2\), the same as Tom's method but described differently.

Mathematically, both Tom and Katie are suggesting the same calculation: \(X \times \frac{40}{100} = X \times 0.4 = X \div 5 \times 2\). 

Thus, both methods are correct. The question becomes how students at different ability levels might perceive this.

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding percentages and the operations involved. They might not fully grasp the concept of percentages as fractions of 100, leading to confusion. However, the direct comparison here might help them see that both are saying the same thing in different words. Given the simplicity of the question and the direct comparison, \( A = 10\%\), \( B = 10\%\), \( C = 60\%\), \( D = 20\%\).

- **Basic**: At this level, students have a foundational understanding of percentages. They should recognize that both methods described by Tom and Katie yield the same result. \( A = 5\%\), \( B = 5\%\), \( C = 80\%\), \( D = 10\%\).

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of percentages and can easily see that both Tom's and Katie's methods are algebraically equivalent. \( A = 2\%\), \( B = 2\%\), \( C = 90\%\), \( D = 6\%\).

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the mathematical equivalence but can also quickly translate between different mathematical representations. They would immediately see that both methods are correct. \( A = 1\%\), \( B = 1\%\), \( C = 95\%\), \( D = 3\%\).

Therefore, the predictions are:
below_basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=90% D=6%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
