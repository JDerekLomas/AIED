To tackle this question, let's first understand the inequality and the statements made by Tom and Katie.

The given inequality is \(15 \geq 4m\).

## Step 1: Solve the Inequality
To find the solution set for \(m\), we divide both sides of the inequality by 4, remembering that this operation does not change the direction of the inequality since we are dividing by a positive number:
\[m \leq \frac{15}{4}\]
\[m \leq 3.75\]

## 2: Evaluate Tom's Statement
Tom says \(m\) could be \(4\). Let's check if \(m = 4\) satisfies the inequality:
\[15 \geq 4 \times 4\]
\[15 \geq 16\]
This statement is false because \(15\) is not greater than or equal to \(16\).

## 3: Evaluate Katie's Statement
Katie says \(m\) could be \(3.75\). Let's check if \(m = 3.75\) satisfies the inequality:
\[15 \geq 4 \times 3.75\]
\[15 \geq 15\]
This statement is true because \(15\) is equal to \(15\).

## 4: Analyze Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with solving the inequality or understanding the statements. They might not correctly substitute \(m = 4\) or \(m = 3.75\) into the inequality. Given the simplicity of the numbers, some might incorrectly think Tom is right because they misunderstand the inequality, and others might see Katie's correctness but not necessarily conclude that Tom is incorrect. 
  - A (Only Tom): 30% (thinking Tom's 4 could work, mistakenly)
  - B (Only Katie): 20% (seeing Katie's correctness but not evaluating Tom properly)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 10% (a guess with no basis)
  - D (Neither is correct): 40% (though incorrectly, as Katie is correct)

- **Basic**: Students here can solve simple inequalities but might make careless mistakes. They should be able to see Katie's statement is correct but might be tricked into thinking Tom could be correct due to a miscalculation.
  - A (Only Tom): 20%
  - B (Only Katie): 60%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 5%
  - D (Neither is correct): 15%

- **Proficient**: These students can accurately solve the inequality and evaluate statements. They should quickly see Katie is correct and Tom is not.
  - A (Only Tom): 5%
  - B (Only Katie): 85%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 0%
  - D (Neither is correct): 10%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level can not only solve the inequality accurately but also quickly identify correct and incorrect statements based on the inequality's solution.
  - A (Only Tom): 0%
  - B (Only Katie): 95%
  - C (Both Tom and Katie): 0%
  - D (Neither is correct): 5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=5% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=0% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
