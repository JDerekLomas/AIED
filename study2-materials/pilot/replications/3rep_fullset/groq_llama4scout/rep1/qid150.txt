To predict how students at different ability levels might respond to this question, let's consider the nature of the question and common misconceptions related to measures of volume.

The question asks students to identify which option is not a measure of volume from the given choices: 
- A: Cubic metres
- B: Centimetres cubed
- C: Litres
- D: Metres

Measures of volume are typically expressed in cubic units (e.g., cubic metres, centimetres cubed) or in litres, which is a common unit for measuring the volume of liquids or gases. 

- Cubic metres (A) and centimetres cubed (B) are clearly measures of volume.
- Litres (C) is also a measure of volume, commonly used for liquids and gases.
- Metres (D) is a measure of length, not volume.

The concept tested here involves understanding the difference between units of length and units of volume. A common misconception among students might be confusing units of length with units of volume, especially if they are not used to seeing volume expressed in various forms.

Given these considerations:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic unit recognition. They might confuse units of length with units of volume more frequently.
  - A = 60% (they might recognize cubic as related to volume)
  - B = 55% (similarly, they might understand "cubed" implies volume)
  - C = 50% (litres are commonly known as a volume measurement, but might be confused)
  - D = 35% (some might incorrectly think metres could be a volume measurement)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still make errors due to lack of practice or misunderstanding of unit specifications.
  - A = 80%
  - B = 75%
  - C = 70%
  - D = 20%

- **Proficient:** Students at this level are likely to understand the concept of volume and common units but might still misinterpret if not fully attentive.
  - A = 95%
  - B = 90%
  - C = 85%
  - D = 5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are expected to have a strong grasp of mathematical concepts, including units of measurement. Errors would be minimal.
  - A = 100%
  - B = 98%
  - C = 98%
  - D = 0%

However, adjusting for a more realistic prediction where even proficient and advanced students might slightly misinterpret due to oversight or rushing:

below_basic: A=60% B=55% C=50% D=35%
basic: A=80% B=75% C=70% D=20%
proficient: A=90% B=85% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=96% C=96% D=2%
