To predict the performance of students at different ability levels on this question, let's analyze the statements given and the common misconceptions or understanding related to similarity in geometry.

- **All circles are similar**: This statement is true. All circles, regardless of their radius, are similar because they have the same shape.

- **All equilateral triangles are similar**: This statement is also true. All equilateral triangles have the same shape, just like all circles do, but differ in size.

- **All rhombuses are similar**: This statement is false. While all squares are similar (as they are a special type of rhombus where all angles are right angles), not all rhombuses are similar. Rhombuses that are not squares can have different angles and side lengths, making them not similar.

- **All regular decagons are similar**: This statement is true. A regular decagon has 10 equal sides and 10 equal angles. All regular decagons, regardless of their size, are similar.

Given this analysis, the question essentially tests the understanding of similarity among different types of polygons and the ability to recognize a false statement among true ones.

The difficulty in this question lies in understanding the conditions for similarity (same shape, but not necessarily the same size) and applying this to various geometric shapes. The misconception likely to be tested here relates to rhombuses, as students might mistakenly believe all rhombuses are similar due to having equal side lengths (which they do, by definition), but overlooking the requirement for equal angles for similarity.

**Predicted Performance**:

- **below_basic**: A=70% B=60% C=20% D=50% 
    - Students at this level might not fully understand the concept of similarity and could randomly select or misunderstand the basic properties of these shapes. They might incorrectly believe all shapes with the same number of sides are similar.

- **basic**: A=80% B=75% C=30% D=65%
    - At this level, students have a basic grasp of shapes and might recall properties of specific shapes but could still confuse similarity with congruence or other properties.

- **proficient**: A=95% B=90% C=60% D=85%
    - Proficient students understand the concept of similarity and can apply it to basic shapes. However, some might still fall into the trap regarding rhombuses.

- **advanced**: A=98% B=95% D=92% C=80%
    - Advanced students are likely to understand the nuances of geometric properties and can easily distinguish between true and false statements regarding similarity. However, a small percentage might still choose the incorrect option out of overconfidence or distraction.

The correct answer is **C**: "All rhombuses are similar". Therefore, the percentages choosing **C** as the false statement would ideally reflect students' understanding of geometry and similarity. The prediction assumes that a considerable number of students, especially at the lower end, might opt for C due to a lack of clarity on shape properties. 

These predictions are adjusted for typical student response patterns on such questions:
below_basic: A=80% B=75% C=10% D=15%
basic: A=90% B=85% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=95% B=90% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=98% B=95% C=2% D=5%
