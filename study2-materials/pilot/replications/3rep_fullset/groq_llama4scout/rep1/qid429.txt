## Step 1: Understand the question and the table of values
The question provides a table of values for the equation \(y = x^2 - x + 1\) and asks to find the value of \(y\) when \(x = -1\), denoted by \(\bigstar\).

## 2: Identify the equation and the value of \(x\) for the missing \(y\)
The equation given is \(y = x^2 - x + 1\). We need to find \(y\) when \(x = -1\).

## 3: Substitute \(x = -1\) into the equation
Substitute \(x = -1\) into \(y = x^2 - x + 1\):
\(y = (-1)^2 - (-1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\).

## 4: Consider common misconceptions or errors
A common error might involve incorrect substitution or calculation, such as forgetting to change the sign of \(-x\) when \(x\) is negative, or miscalculating the result.

## 5: Evaluate the options based on the calculation
Given \(y = 3\) when \(x = -1\), let's look at the options:
- A: \(3\)
- B: \(1\)
- C: \(4\)
- D: \(-1\)

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substituting \(x = -1\) into the equation or with basic arithmetic. They might choose B, C, or D due to calculation errors.
- **Basic**: Students here should be able to substitute and calculate but might make simple arithmetic mistakes. They are more likely to get it right or make minor errors.
- **Proficient**: These students should accurately substitute and calculate, likely choosing A.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level are expected to not only calculate correctly but also understand the context and implications of their calculation, also likely to choose A.

## 7: Estimate percentages for each option at different ability levels
- **Below_basic**: A=20% (correct calculation but might be a guess), B=30% (error in calculation), C=20% (overestimation), D=30% (incorrect calculation).
- **Basic**: A=70% (correct), B=15% (minor error), C=10% (another error), D=5% (significant error).
- **Proficient**: A=90% (correct), B=5% (simple mistake), C=3% (error), D=2% (unlikely error).
- **Advanced**: A=95% (correct), B=3% (unlikely), C=1% (very unlikely), D=1% (very unlikely).

## 8: Correct the estimation based on realistic expectations
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation and the equation provided, most students should be able to get it right, especially since it's a simple substitution.

## 9: Finalize the predictions
- **Below_basic**: A=20%, B=30%, C=20%, D=30%
- **Basic**: A=70%, B=15%, C=10%, D=5%
- **Proficient**: A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%
- **Advanced**: A=95%, B=3%, C=1%, D=1%

The best answer is A.
