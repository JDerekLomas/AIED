To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the task and the potential pitfalls for students at different levels.

The task requires students to estimate the square root of 89 without a calculator and determine between which two integers it lies. The square root of 89 is approximately 9.43.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The question asks for the two integers between which \( \sqrt{89} \) must lie. This involves finding two consecutive integers such that \( \sqrt{89} \) is greater than the smaller and less than the larger.

## 2: Identifying Key Numbers
Key numbers to consider are the perfect squares around 89: \( 9^2 = 81 \), \( 10^2 = 100 \). Since \( 81 < 89 < 100 \), it follows that \( 9 < \sqrt{89} < 10 \).

## 3: Analyzing Potential Errors
- A common misconception might involve not recognizing that \( \sqrt{89} \) is between 9 and 10 because students might not easily recall or calculate that \( \sqrt{81} = 9 \) and \( \sqrt{100} = 10 \).
- Some students might incorrectly apply operations or misjudge the magnitude of \( \sqrt{89} \), potentially placing it near \( \sqrt{81} \) or \( \sqrt{100} \) but not precisely between 9 and 10.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with basic arithmetic and recall of squares. They might not understand how to approach the question or might pick an answer based on limited understanding. Option C (81 and 100) could seem plausible because it directly relates to perfect squares, but it's less likely to be chosen as it's not "between" in the traditional sense. Option D (9 and 10) seems most straightforward for those with some basic understanding. 
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and might recognize that \( \sqrt{89} \) is near 9 but larger, making D (9 and 10) a likely choice. They might also consider B (8 and 9) if they incorrectly think \( \sqrt{64} = 8 \) and \( \sqrt{81} = 9 \), making 89 closer to 81 than to 100.
- **Proficient**: These students are likely to quickly identify that \( \sqrt{89} \) falls between 9 and 10, choosing D. They understand squares and roots well enough to make this calculation mentally.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students will also quickly choose D, as they have a strong grasp of number properties and can easily estimate \( \sqrt{89} \) to be between 9 and 10.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=5% (unlikely, as it suggests a very specific and incorrect range), B=20% (might consider if recalling smaller squares), C=30% (directly related to perfect squares), D=45% (most likely due to basic logic).
- **Basic**: A=5%, B=15% (could mistakenly consider smaller squares), C=10%, D=70%.
- **Proficient**: A=0%, B=5%, C=5%, D=90%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=5% B=20% C=30% D=45%
basic: A=5% B=15% C=10% D=70%
proficient: A=0% B=5% C=5% D=90%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
