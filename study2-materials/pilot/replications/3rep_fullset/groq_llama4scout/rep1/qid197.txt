To approach this question, let's consider the concepts involved and the potential pitfalls for students at different levels.

The question presents two lines on a graph that meet at a right angle. The key concept here is the understanding of the relationship between lines that intersect at a right angle, which is described as "perpendicular."

1. **Understanding the Concepts:**
   - **Perpendicular lines** are lines that intersect at a right angle (90 degrees).
   - **Parallel lines** are lines that lie in the same plane and never intersect, no matter how far they are extended.
   - A **parallelogram** is a type of quadrilateral with opposite sides that are parallel to each other. This term is not directly relevant to the relationship between two lines that intersect.

2. **Analyzing Potential Errors:**
   - The term "parallelogram" (A) might confuse some students if they mistakenly think about shapes formed by lines rather than the relationship between the lines themselves.
   - "Parallel" (C) is incorrect because parallel lines do not intersect.
   - "Particular" (D) does not describe a geometric relationship and seems out of place.

3. **Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level:**

### below_basic:
- Students at this level might struggle with basic geometric vocabulary.
- They might confuse basic terms or not understand the specific definitions.
- **A=20%** (some might mistakenly associate with shapes),
- **B=50%** (if they have any sense of right angles, they might get this),
- **C=20%** (confusing with parallel, if they recall the term but not its meaning),
- **D=10%** (unrelated term, but some might pick it out of desperation or misunderstanding).

### basic:
- Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make careless mistakes.
- **A=10%** (less likely to confuse with shapes now),
- **B=70%** (good understanding of basic terms),
- **C=15%** (still some confusion with parallel),
- **D=5%** (recognize it doesn't fit).

### proficient:
- These students have a solid grasp of geometric concepts.
- **A=5%** (unlikely to confuse with a type of quadrilateral),
- **B=85%** (clear understanding of perpendicular),
- **C=5%** (very unlikely to confuse with parallel),
- **D=5%** (aware it's not a geometric term related to line relationships).

### advanced:
- Advanced students have a deep understanding and are less likely to make mistakes on basic concepts.
- **A=0%** (no confusion with parallelogram),
- **B=95%** (clear and confident identification of perpendicular lines),
- **C=0%** (no confusion with parallel),
- **D=5%** (unlikely but could be a very careless mistake).

Given these considerations:

below_basic: A=20% B=50% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
