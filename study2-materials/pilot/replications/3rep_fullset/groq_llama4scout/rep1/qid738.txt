To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it presents.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task involves rotating a blue shape \( 90^{\circ} \) anticlockwise about a given point \( (-2,2) \) and identifying which of the provided shapes (A, B, C, D) represents the correct result of this rotation.

## 2: Identifying Key Challenges
A key challenge in this task is understanding how to perform a \( 90^{\circ} \) anticlockwise rotation about a point that is not the origin. The rotation matrix for rotating a point \( (x, y) \) about the origin is \( \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -y \\ x \end{pmatrix} \). However, rotating about a point \( (a, b) \) requires translating the system to make \( (a, b) \) the temporary origin, applying the rotation, and then translating back.

## 3: Analyzing Student Ability Levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with coordinate geometry concepts, including rotations. They may not fully understand how to apply a rotation formula or might get confused with the translation steps required for rotation about a non-origin point.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic geometric transformations but might still find applying these concepts in coordinate form challenging, especially if they haven't practiced rotations about non-origin points extensively.
- **Proficient:** These students should be comfortable with rotating shapes on a coordinate grid, including understanding how to rotate about a point other than the origin. They should be able to apply the rotation formula and translate coordinates accordingly.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the mechanics of rotation but can also likely visualize or quickly calculate the effect of such a rotation, including handling the algebraic aspects with ease.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
Given the blue shape and the point of rotation \( (-2,2) \), let's consider the nature of the shapes provided:
- The correct rotation can be determined by applying the rotation formula or by visualizing the movement.

## 5: Detailed Prediction
Without loss of generality, let's consider what might happen:
- **Below Basic:** High chance of selecting an incorrect option due to misunderstanding of rotation concepts. Let's assume A=40%, B=30%, C=15%, D=15%.
- **Basic:** Still a risk of error but more likely to attempt a correct solution. Assume A=30%, B=25%, C=20%, D=25%.
- **Proficient:** Should have a good grasp of the concept. Assume A=10%, B=10%, C=10%, D=70%.
- **Advanced:** Highly likely to get it correct. Assume A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.

## 6: Providing the Final Predictions
Based on the thought process:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=30% B=25% C=20% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=10% C=10% D=70%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
