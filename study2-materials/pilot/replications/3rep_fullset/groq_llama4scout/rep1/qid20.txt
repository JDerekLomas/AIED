## Step 1: Understand the question and the concept being tested
The question tests the understanding of the formula for the volume of a cuboid, which is \( \text{volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \). Given that the volume of the cuboid is \( 30 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \), the height is \( 3 \mathrm{~cm} \), and the depth (which we can consider as the width) is \( 2 \mathrm{~cm} \), we need to find the length (labelled with a star) that satisfies the equation.

## 2: Calculate the correct length
Using the volume formula, we can substitute the given values: \( 30 = \text{length} \times 2 \times 3 \). Solving for length gives \( 30 = 6 \times \text{length} \), which simplifies to \( \text{length} = 30 / 6 = 5 \mathrm{~cm} \).

## 3: Analyze the potential misconceptions and errors
The potential misconception here could involve confusion with the formula or incorrect substitution of values. However, the question is straightforward and requires simple substitution and rearrangement of the volume formula.

## 4: Consider student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the basic algebra involved or might not fully understand the concept of volume. They could mistakenly choose an option without calculation or pick an answer that seems "right" based on incorrect assumptions. Given the simplicity of the calculation, \( D = 25 \mathrm{~cm} \) might appeal to those not doing the calculation, as it's a large number and might seem more significant. \( A = 5\% B = 20\% C = 15\% D = 60\% \)
- **Basic:** Students at this level should have a grasp of the volume formula but might make careless errors. They are likely to attempt the calculation but could get the arithmetic wrong. \( A = 5\% B = 70\% C = 10\% D = 15\% \)
- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept well and can apply it accurately. They should easily solve for the length. \( A = 5\% B = 90\% C = 3\% D = 2\% \)
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concept but can also manipulate formulas with ease. They would quickly and accurately solve the problem. \( A = 0\% B = 98\% C = 1\% D = 1\% \)

## 5: Determine the predicted percentages for each ability level
Based on the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=5% B=20% C=15% D=60%
- **Basic:** A=5% B=70% C=10% D=15%
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=5% B=20% C=15% D=60%
basic: A=5% B=70% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
