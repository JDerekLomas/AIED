## Step 1: Understand the question and the formula for the area of a trapezium
The area \(A\) of a trapezium is given by the formula \(A = \frac{1}{2}h(a + b)\), where \(h\) is the height (the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides), and \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the parallel sides.

## 2: Apply the formula to the given problem
Given that the area \(A = 30 \, \mathrm{cm}^2\), the height \(h = 5 \, \mathrm{cm}\), and one of the parallel sides \(a = 8 \, \mathrm{cm}\), we need to find the length of the other parallel side \(b\) (represented by the star).

## 3: Substitute the given values into the formula
\[30 = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times (8 + b)\]

## 4: Solve for \(b\)
\[30 = \frac{5}{2} \times (8 + b)\]
\[30 \times \frac{2}{5} = 8 + b\]
\[12 = 8 + b\]
\[b = 12 - 8\]
\[b = 4\]

## 5: Analyze the options with respect to student ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the formula or substituting values into it. They might also have difficulty solving for \(b\). Given the straightforward nature of the calculation once the formula is applied, errors might arise from misapplication of the formula or algebraic mistakes. Option B (\(4 \, \mathrm{cm}\)) is the correct answer, but these students might be more likely to select incorrect options due to calculation errors or misunderstanding the formula. Let's assume A=20%, B=40%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level should be familiar with the area formula and able to substitute values. However, they might make algebraic errors or not check their solutions adequately. The correct calculation leads directly to \(b = 4 \, \mathrm{cm}\), so let's assume A=10%, B=70%, C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students are expected to apply the formula correctly and solve for \(b\) without issues. They should easily identify \(b = 4 \, \mathrm{cm}\). Let's assume A=5%, B=85%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should not only solve the problem correctly but also be able to identify any potential issues with the question or alternative solutions. They would quickly determine \(b = 4 \, \mathrm{cm}\) and be less likely to consider incorrect options. Let's assume A=0%, B=95%, C=0%, D=5%.

## 6: Format the predictions
