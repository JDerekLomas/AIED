To approach this question, let's consider the nature of the equation and the steps involved in solving it, as well as common misconceptions students might have.

The given equation is \((d+3)^2 - 25 = 0\). To solve for \(d\), the first step is to isolate the squared term:

\((d+3)^2 = 25\)

This step is algebraically correct and straightforward. The question then is about taking the square root of both sides, which is where students might introduce errors due to misconceptions about square roots.

## Step 1: Understanding the Correct Next Step
The correct next step after \((d+3)^2 = 25\) is to take the square root of both sides. Remembering that \(\sqrt{x^2} = |x|\) but in equations, we consider both the positive and negative square roots, the correct step is:

\(d+3 = \pm 5\)

## 2: Evaluating the Options
- Option A: \(d+3 = 5\) suggests only the positive square root is considered, ignoring the negative possibility.
- Option B: \(d+3 = 12.5\) implies taking the square root of 25 incorrectly or adding something to 5, which doesn't follow from the equation directly.
- Option C: \(d^2 = 22\) does not follow from the given equation; it seems to misunderstand the algebraic manipulation required.
- Option D: \(d+3 = \pm 5\) correctly represents taking both the positive and negative square roots of 25.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and are likely to make significant errors. They might choose A (20%) because they only see the positive aspect, B (15%) due to a miscalculation or incorrect operation, C (30%) because they might try to expand or incorrectly simplify, and D (35%) if they somehow recall the \(\pm\) rule.
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding but might still fall into traps. They might choose A (40%) because they forget the \(\pm\), B (10%) due to confusion, C (20%) from incorrect expansion or simplification attempts, and D (30%) if they remember the correct procedure.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the algebra but might still be tested on remembering the \(\pm\). They might choose A (20%) for simplicity, B (5%) in error, C (5%) if confused, and D (70%) as the correct step.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are expected to handle such algebraic manipulations with ease and are less likely to make errors. They might choose A (5%) out of habit or oversight, B (0%) as it's clearly incorrect, C (0%) for the same reason, and D (95%) as the obvious correct choice.

## 4: Providing the Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
- **Basic:** A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
- **Proficient:** A=20% B=5% C=5% D=70%
- **Advanced:** A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=30% D=35%
basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
proficient: A=20% B=5% C=5% D=70%
advanced: A=5% B=0% C=0% D=95%
