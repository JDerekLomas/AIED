## Step 1: Analyzing the Functions
First, let's analyze the given functions: $y=x^{2} - 4$ and $y=x-4$. The function $y=x^{2} - 4$ is a quadratic function, which represents a parabola, and $y=x-4$ is a linear function, which represents a straight line.

## 2: Evaluating Tom's Statement
Tom says both functions are linear. Given that $y=x^{2} - 4$ is quadratic and not linear, Tom's statement is incorrect. A linear function has the form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ and $b$ are constants, and the highest power of $x$ is 1. The function $y=x^{2} - 4$ does not fit this form because it has $x^{2}$, making it non-linear.

## 3: Evaluating Katie's Statement
Katie says both functions cross the $y$-axis at the same point. To find where each function crosses the $y$-axis, we set $x=0$ for each function. For $y=x^{2} - 4$, when $x=0$, $y=0^{2} - 4 = -4$. For $y=x-4$, when $x=0$, $y=0-4 = -4$. Therefore, both functions cross the $y$-axis at the point $(0, -4)$, making Katie's statement correct.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic function types and graphing. They might not understand the difference between linear and quadratic functions or how to find $y$-intercepts. Tom's statement could seem plausible if they don't recognize $y=x^{2} - 4$ as non-linear, and Katie's could seem correct if they calculate the $y$-intercept correctly or misunderstand the concept. However, given the simplicity of calculating $y$-intercepts and basic function types, more might get Katie's statement right than Tom's. 
  - A (Only Tom) = 20% (some might mistakenly think both are linear)
  - B (Only Katie) = 40% (correctly identify Katie, possibly incorrectly dismiss Tom)
  - C (Both Tom and Katie) = 10% (unlikely to think both are correct)
  - D (Neither is correct) = 30% (recognize both statements' validity or lack thereof)

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of linear and quadratic equations but might make careless mistakes. They should recognize $y=x^{2} - 4$ as quadratic and $y=x-4$ as linear, making Tom incorrect. They should also correctly find that both cross the $y$-axis at $(0, -4)$.
  - A = 5% (unlikely to think Tom is correct)
  - B = 60% (likely to see Katie is correct, Tom is not)
  - C = 5% (unlikely to think both are correct)
  - D = 30% (might recognize both are incorrect)

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and should easily identify Tom as incorrect and Katie as correct.
  - A = 0% (should recognize Tom's error)
  - B = 80% (correctly identify Katie, dismiss Tom)
  - C = 0% (know both cannot be correct)
  - D = 20% (understand both statements' correctness)

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and should quickly assess both statements.
  - A = 0% 
  - B = 90% 
  - C = 0% 
  - D = 10% 

## 5: Providing the Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=60% C=5% D=30%
