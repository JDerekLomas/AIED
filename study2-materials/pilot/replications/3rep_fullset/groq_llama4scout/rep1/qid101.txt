To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question "What is \( 8 \) out of \( 40 \) as a percentage?", let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question requires students to convert a fraction into a percentage. The fraction given is \( \frac{8}{40} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{1}{5} \) or \( 0.2 \) when converted to a decimal. To convert \( 0.2 \) into a percentage, students multiply by \( 100 \), resulting in \( 20\% \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception when converting fractions to percentages involves errors in division or multiplication, or failing to convert the fraction to a decimal or percentage correctly. However, in this case, the numbers are straightforward: \( 8 \) out of \( 40 \) can be directly converted by dividing \( 8 \) by \( 40 \) to get \( 0.2 \), then multiplying by \( 100 \) to get \( 20\% \).

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( 8.4\% \). This would be an incorrect answer resulting from a miscalculation, possibly \( \frac{8}{40} \times 100 = 20\% \), but if a student mistakenly calculated or rounded incorrectly, they might arrive at a wrong answer. However, given the simplicity of \( \frac{8}{40} \), this seems less likely.

## 3: Considering Student Errors
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic division and multiplication facts or converting between fractions, decimals, and percentages. They might incorrectly calculate \( \frac{8}{40} \) as \( 0.2 \) but then struggle to convert it to a percentage, potentially choosing A if they made a calculation error like \( 0.084 \times 100 = 8.4\% \) or simply guessed.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make simple arithmetic errors. They are likely to calculate \( \frac{8}{40} = 0.2 \) and then \( 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \), choosing B. Errors leading to A, C, or D would be less common but could occur.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp of fractions, decimals, and percentages. They would easily calculate \( \frac{8}{40} = 0.2 \) and convert it to \( 20\% \), choosing B. Errors are less likely but could occur if they misread the question or made a calculation mistake under pressure.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a deep understanding and would quickly and accurately calculate \( 20\% \), selecting B with high confidence. Errors here would be very rare.

## 4: Predicting Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question, most students, even at the basic level, should be able to get it right if they apply the correct method.

- **Below Basic**: A=30% (miscalculation or lack of understanding), B=40% (correct but perhaps through luck), C=15% (potential for another miscalculation), D=15% (another miscalculation).
- **Basic**: A=10%, B=80%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: A=2%, B=95%, C=1%, D=2%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=99%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

The best answer is B. 
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=99% C=0.5% D=0.5%
