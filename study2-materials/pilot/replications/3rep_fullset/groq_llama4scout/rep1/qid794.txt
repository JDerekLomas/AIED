To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and the common misconceptions associated with probabilities, particularly in the context of multiple events or outcomes.

The question provides the probability of choosing a strawberry sweet as \(0.8\) and asks for the probability of choosing an orange sweet without giving specific probabilities for the other types of sweets. This scenario implies that there are at least three types of sweets: strawberry, orange, and blackcurrant.

## Step 1: Understanding the Given Information
The probability of choosing a strawberry sweet is \(0.8\). This means that the combined probability of choosing an orange sweet or a blackcurrant sweet must be \(1 - 0.8 = 0.2\), since the total probability of all possible outcomes must sum to \(1\).

## 2: Identifying the Misconception
A common misconception might be to assume that without specific probabilities for each type of sweet (orange and blackcurrant), one cannot determine the probability of choosing an orange sweet. However, the question actually tests the understanding that the probability of one event does not dictate the probability of another event without additional information, but the sum of probabilities of all outcomes must be 1.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A (\( \frac{1}{3} \)) suggests a specific, equal probability for each type of sweet if there were only three, which is not supported by the information given.
- Option B (\(0.1\)) implies a specific probability for the orange sweet without justification.
- Option C (\(0.2\)) could be considered if one thought the remaining probability (after strawberry) was evenly split between orange and blackcurrant, but this assumes equal probability for orange and blackcurrant without evidence.
- Option D (Impossible to know) seems correct because, without additional information about the probability of choosing a blackcurrant sweet or more details, one cannot calculate the exact probability of choosing an orange sweet.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand probability concepts. They might choose an option based on a misunderstanding or guess. Given the simplicity of options, some might choose A, B, or C based on a false assumption of equal distribution or another incorrect rationale. D might seem correct to some because it implies uncertainty.
- **Basic:** Students here have a grasp of basic probability but might struggle with abstract scenarios. They might lean towards D because they recognize the lack of information but could also be tempted by simple fractions or decimals.
- **Proficient:** These students understand probability rules. They should recognize that without specific information about the distribution of orange and blackcurrant sweets, the probability of choosing an orange sweet cannot be determined precisely. Hence, they would likely choose D.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the rules of probability but can also analyze the question for what information is given and what is implied. They would certainly choose D, as they can see that the information given does not specify how the \(0.2\) remaining probability is distributed between orange and blackcurrant sweets.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the above analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic:** A=20% B=15% C=15% D=50%
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The best answer is D. 

Therefore, in the exact format requested:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=15% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
