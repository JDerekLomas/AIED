## Step 1: Analyze the question
The question asks students to multiply out the brackets in the expression \( m(2m - 7) \). This is a basic algebra question testing the distributive property.

## 2: Identify common misconceptions
A common misconception in algebra is failing to distribute correctly or incorrectly handling the terms within the brackets. For example, students might add the terms inside the brackets to \( m \) instead of multiplying \( m \) by each term inside the brackets.

## 3: Evaluate option A
Option A is \( 3m - 7 \). This would be incorrect because it incorrectly adds \( m \) to \( 2m - 7 \) instead of distributing \( m \) across \( 2m \) and \( -7 \).

## 4: Evaluate option B
Option B is \( 2m^2 - 7 \). This option incorrectly omits the multiplication of \( m \) by \( -7 \) and also mistakenly keeps \( 2m \) as \( 2m \) instead of \( 2m^2 \) when multiplied by \( m \).

## 5: Evaluate option C
Option C is \( 3m - 7m \). This simplifies to \( -4m \), which doesn't relate to correctly expanding \( m(2m - 7) \) and seems to combine like terms incorrectly in the context of the question.

## 6: Evaluate option D
Option D is \( 2m^2 - 7m \). This is the correct expansion of \( m(2m - 7) \) using the distributive property: \( m \times 2m = 2m^2 \) and \( m \times -7 = -7m \).

## 7: Consider student abilities
- **below_basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They are likely to make significant errors, such as incorrectly adding or not distributing at all.
- **basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebra but might still make careless mistakes or not fully understand the distributive property.
- **proficient**: These students understand algebra well and are less likely to make careless mistakes but might still fall into traps if the question is phrased in a tricky way.
- **advanced**: Students at this level have a strong grasp of algebra and are likely to get the question correct with ease.

## 8: Predict student responses
Given the nature of the question, most students, even those who are proficient, should be able to get it right because it directly tests a fundamental concept without much complexity.

## 9: Allocate percentages
- **below_basic**: A=40% (simple addition error), B=20% (misses distribution), C=10% (random error), D=30% (gets it right or partially understands distribution).
- **basic**: A=20% (addition error), B=15% (partial understanding), C=5% (error in combining terms), D=60% (correct application of distributive property).
- **proficient**: A=5% (minor error), B=5% (careless), C=0% (unlikely mistake), D=90% (confident application).
- **advanced**: A=0% (unlikely error), B=0% (no chance), C=0% (no chance), D=100% (no errors expected).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=5% D=60%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
