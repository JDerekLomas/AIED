## Step 1: Understand the question and the misconception it tests.
The question requires students to understand the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) and how brackets affect this order. The task is to add brackets to the expression \(3 \times 2+4-5\) so that the result equals 13. The correct approach involves calculating the expression with different bracket placements to see which one yields 13.

## 2: Solve the expression with each option to identify the correct one.
Let's evaluate each option:
- Option A: \(3 \times (2+4) - 5 = 3 \times 6 - 5 = 18 - 5 = 13\)
- Option B: \(3 \times 2 + (4 - 5) = 6 + (-1) = 5\)
- Option C: \(3 \times (2 + 4 - 5) = 3 \times 1 = 3\)
- Option D: \(3 \times 2 + 4 - 5 = 6 + 4 - 5 = 5\)

## 3: Analyze the difficulty of the question for different ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with understanding the order of operations and the effect of brackets. They might randomly select options or misunderstand the concept of brackets altogether.
- **Basic:** Basic level students should have a grasp of the order of operations but might still struggle with applying it to find the correct bracket placement to achieve a specific result.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the order of operations and can apply it well. They should be able to evaluate expressions and understand how brackets change the calculation.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the concepts but can also apply them efficiently to solve problems and verify results.

## 4: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option at different ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** 
  - A: 20% (some might stumble upon the correct answer by chance or through trial and error)
  - B: 15% (random selection)
  - C: 10% (random selection)
  - D: 55% (might think brackets aren't needed or don't understand their use)

- **Basic:**
  - A: 40% (start to understand the use of brackets but might make calculation mistakes)
  - B: 20% (understand basic operations but misapply)
  - C: 15% (misunderstand how to use brackets to achieve the desired result)
  - D: 25% (still unsure about the necessity of brackets)

- **Proficient:**
  - A: 70% (can calculate and understand the effect of brackets correctly)
  - B: 10% (calculate but misapply the concept)
  - C: 5% (unlikely to choose this as they understand the operations)
  - D: 15% (know brackets are not needed for the original expression to be calculated conventionally)

- **Advanced:**
  - A: 90% (easily solve and verify the correct placement)
  - B: 5% (very unlikely to choose this)
  - C: 0% (understand the expression evaluates to a different number)
  - D: 5% (know the conventional calculation doesn't require brackets)

## 5: Translate predictions into the required format.
Given the predictions:
- **below_basic:** A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
- **basic:** A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%
- **proficient:** A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
- **advanced:** A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=70% B=10% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=0% D=5%
