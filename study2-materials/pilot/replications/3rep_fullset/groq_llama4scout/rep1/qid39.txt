To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \(598 - 1000 =\), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it presents.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires the student to perform a simple subtraction: \(598 - 1000\). This operation involves subtracting a larger number from a smaller one, which can lead to a negative result. A common misconception or difficulty might arise from students not understanding how to handle subtraction that results in a negative number or simply making a calculation error.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
- A common error might be for students to subtract 1000 from 598 and then either forget to make the result negative or not understand that the result should be negative because 598 is less than 1000.
- Another potential issue could be students thinking the problem cannot be solved if they misunderstand the operation or the concept of negative numbers.

## 3: Analyzing Option Choices
- Option A: \(402\) suggests a student might have simply subtracted 598 from 1000 without considering the correct order or result.
- Option B: \(-402\) is the correct answer, indicating an understanding of subtracting a larger number from a smaller one, resulting in a negative number.
- Option C: \(-412\) suggests a calculation error.
- Option D: "This problem cannot be solved" implies a misunderstanding of the operation or the concept of negative numbers.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle with basic arithmetic operations, especially when negative results are involved. They might choose A (incorrectly thinking 1000 - 598 = 402, without making it negative) or D (thinking the problem can't be solved).
  - A: 40%
  - B: 10%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 45%

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a grasp of basic arithmetic but might still struggle with negative numbers or make calculation errors.
  - A: 25%
  - B: 50%
  - C: 15%
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient:** These students understand basic arithmetic operations, including handling negative results. They are less likely to make errors but might still occasionally choose an incorrect option due to oversight.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 85%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident in their arithmetic skills and are less likely to make mistakes. They would likely choose the correct option B.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 95%
  - C: 0%
  - D: 5%

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=5% D=45%
- basic: A=25% B=50% C=15% D=10%
- proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=5% D=45%
basic: A=25% B=50% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=0% D=5%
