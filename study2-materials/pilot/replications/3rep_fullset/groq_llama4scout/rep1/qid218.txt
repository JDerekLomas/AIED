To approach this question, let's first understand the relationship between journey time and average speed. The journey time \(T\) can be represented as \(T = \frac{D}{S}\), where \(D\) is the distance traveled and \(S\) is the average speed. If the distance \(D\) is constant, then as \(S\) increases, \(T\) decreases, and the relationship is not linear but rather hyperbolic.

Let's analyze the options with this in mind:

A: A straight line graph starting at the origin and travelling right with a positive gradient.
- This suggests a direct proportional relationship, which does not match \(T = \frac{D}{S}\).

B: A curved graph that starts at the origin. As you move right it travels steeply up, then levels off.
- This could suggest an exponential or quadratic relationship, not matching our hyperbolic relationship.

C: A curved graph that starts up and right of the origin. As you move right it travels steeply down, then levels off but never reaches the x-axis.
- This option suggests a graph that could represent a hyperbolic relationship, where as speed increases, journey time decreases, approaching but never actually reaching zero.

D: A straight line graph starting partway up the y-axis and travelling right with a negative gradient until it hits the x-axis.
- This suggests a linear relationship between journey time and speed, which is not accurate for \(T = \frac{D}{S}\).

Given these descriptions, let's predict the student responses:

- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might not fully understand the relationship between speed, distance, and time or might not be able to interpret graphs well. They might mistakenly choose a straightforward linear relationship or a graph that seems to make sense intuitively but doesn't actually represent the correct relationship.
  - A: 30% (simple direct relationship might appeal)
  - B: 20% (could seem plausible for some)
  - C: 30% (might seem right because it curves)
  - D: 20% (linear decrease seems logical for some)

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding and might be able to eliminate some obviously incorrect options.
  - A: 20% (less appealing as they might see it's linear)
  - B: 15% (recognize it's not linear but might not understand the specific relationship)
  - C: 50% (most likely to choose the one that resembles a hyperbolic relationship)
  - D: 15% (seems too straightforward and incorrect)

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts well and can apply them to various contexts.
  - A: 5% (they know it's not a direct relationship)
  - B: 5% (they can rule out incorrect relationships)
  - C: 80% (clearly understand the hyperbolic nature of the relationship)
  - D: 10% (might consider but quickly rule out)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level can analyze complex relationships and apply mathematical concepts accurately.
  - A: 0% (know it's incorrect)
  - B: 0% (can easily rule out)
  - C: 95% (clear understanding of the hyperbolic relationship)
  - D: 5% (might consider for a moment but quickly dismiss)

Based on these considerations:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
