To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding related to it.

The question revolves around the relationship \(\frac{a}{b+c}=a \div(b+c)\). This equation essentially tests the understanding that division by a fraction (or in this case, a sum which can be considered as a single entity) is equivalent to multiplication by the reciprocal of that fraction. However, the statement given directly equates division by a sum to division, which might seem inherently true because \(a \div (b+c) = \frac{a}{b+c}\) due to the definition of division by a fraction.

## Understanding and Potential Misconceptions:

1. **Basic Understanding**: Students at a basic level might not fully grasp the algebraic representation or might confuse the operations. They could mistakenly think the statement needs more information or could be always true without deeply analyzing \(a, b,\) and \(c\).

2. **Proficient Level**: Students at this level should understand the basic operations and possibly some algebraic manipulations. They should recognize that \(\frac{a}{b+c}\) is indeed \(a \div (b+c)\) by definition, suggesting the statement could be considered always true if \(a, b,\) and \(c\) are defined and \(b + c \neq 0\).

3. **Advanced Level**: Advanced students would likely consider edge cases, such as when \(b + c = 0\), which would make the expression undefined. They understand that \(a, b,\) and \(c\) being different does not directly impact the truth of the equation but that \(b + c \neq 0\) is crucial.

## Predictions:

- **Below Basic**: At this level, students might struggle with the abstract representation. They might think the statement is always true because they do not see any conditions under which it wouldn't be (not understanding that division by zero is undefined). So, \(C = 60\%\), \(D = 30\%\), \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 5\%\).

- **Basic**: Basic students, familiar with fractions and division, might lean towards thinking it's always true since they see it as a statement of fact about how division and fractions work. So, \(C = 70\%\), \(D = 20\%\), \(A = 5\%\), \(B = 5\%\).

- **Proficient**: Proficient students should understand the equivalence but might start to consider conditions for \(a, b,\) and \(c\). However, since \(a, b,\) and \(c\) are different and no specific conditions are given that would make \(b + c = 0\), they might still incline towards it being always true. So, \(C = 80\%\), \(B = 10\%\), \(D = 5\%\), \(A = 5\%\).

- **Advanced**: Advanced students are likely to consider the conditions under which the statement holds, notably \(b + c \neq 0\). Given \(a, b,\) and \(c\) are just stated to be different, they might realize the equation holds as long as \(b + c \neq 0\), which isn't guaranteed. Thus, they might think it's sometimes true. So, \(B = 60\%\), \(C = 30\%\), \(A = 5\%\), \(D = 5\%\).

## Formatted Response:
