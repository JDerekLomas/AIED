To solve this, let's first understand the concept being tested and then predict the student responses based on their ability levels.

The question tests the student's understanding of multiplying decimals and their ability to rearrange an equation to solve for a variable. The equation given is \(0.03 \times \bigstar = 0.00009\). To find \(\bigstar\), students need to divide both sides by 0.03.

## Step 1: Solve for \(\bigstar\)
\(\bigstar = \frac{0.00009}{0.03}\)

## 2: Perform the Division
To divide by 0.03, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 100 to make the denominator a whole number: \(\bigstar = \frac{0.00009 \times 100}{0.03 \times 100} = \frac{0.009}{3} = 0.003\).

## 3: Analyze the Options
- A: \(0.003\)
- B: \(0.03\)
- C: \(0.3\)
- D: \(0.0003\)

The correct answer is A: \(0.003\).

## 4: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with decimal operations and rearranging equations. They might incorrectly apply operations or not understand how to solve for \(\bigstar\). Given the nature of the question, a significant portion might choose B (\(0.03\)) because it matches one of the decimals in the equation, or D (\(0.0003\)) due to confusion with the decimal places. 
  - A: 20%
  - B: 40%
  - C: 10%
  - D: 30%

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make errors due to miscalculation or misunderstanding of decimal division. They are more likely to recognize the need for division but might struggle with the decimal places.
  - A: 50%
  - B: 25%
  - C: 10%
  - D: 15%

- **Proficient**: These students understand decimal operations and can solve for \(\bigstar\) accurately. However, a small percentage might still make careless errors.
  - A: 90%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 2%
  - D: 3%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the operations but are also less likely to make careless errors. They would quickly and accurately solve the equation.
  - A: 98%
  - B: 1%
  - C: 0.5%
  - D: 0.5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=25% C=10% D=15%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
