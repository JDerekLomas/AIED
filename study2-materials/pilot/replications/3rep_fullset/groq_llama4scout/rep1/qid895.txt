To approach this question, let's analyze the calculation and the statements made by Jo and Paul, and then predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option.

The original calculation is \(9 - 8 + 5\).

## Step 1: Evaluate the original calculation
First, let's solve the original calculation following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).
So, \(9 - 8 + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6\).

## 2: Evaluate Jo's statement
Jo suggests rewriting the calculation as \(9 - (8 + 5)\).
Let's solve it: \(9 - (8 + 5) = 9 - 13 = -4\).
This does not equal 6.

## 3: Evaluate Paul's statement
Paul suggests leaving it as \(9 - 8 + 5\), which we've already calculated equals 6.

## 4: Determine who is correct
From the calculations, Paul is correct because \(9 - 8 + 5 = 6\), and Jo's suggestion does not equal 6.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic arithmetic operations and understanding the order of operations. They might incorrectly think Jo is right or not understand how to evaluate either statement correctly. However, given the straightforward nature of Paul's statement and the error in Jo's, a significant portion might still be confused. 
  - A: 20% (some might mistakenly think Jo's way is correct due to misunderstanding)
  - B: 40% (recognize Paul's statement works)
  - C: 10% (unlikely to think both are correct given the calculations)
  - D: 30% (might think neither is correct due to confusion)

- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of basic operations but might still be prone to errors in more complex scenarios or when applying rules strictly.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 60%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 25%

- **Proficient**: These students understand and can apply mathematical rules effectively.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 80%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 10%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand but can also critically evaluate mathematical statements.
  - A: 0%
  - B: 90%
  - C: 5%
  - D: 5%

The best answer is below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
