To approach this question, let's analyze the function machine and the claims made by Tom and Katie.

The function machine takes an input of \(m + 2\) and produces an output of \(3m + 2\).

## Step 1: Analyze Tom's Claim
Tom claims the function could be \(+2m\). To test this, we substitute \(m + 2\) into Tom's proposed function:
\[ (m + 2) + 2m = 3m + 2 \]
This matches the output given by the function machine, so Tom's claim is correct.

## 2: Analyze Katie's Claim
Katie claims the function could be \(\times 3\). To test this, we substitute \(m + 2\) into Katie's proposed function:
\[ 3(m + 2) = 3m + 6 \]
This does not match the output \(3m + 2\) given by the function machine, so Katie's claim is incorrect.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may struggle with algebraic expressions and substituting into functions. They might not fully understand the function machine concept or how to verify the claims. Given the simplicity of the verification process, some might incorrectly agree with Katie due to misunderstanding the operations, but most would likely struggle to verify either claim accurately. 
  - A: Only Tom (40%) - Some understand Tom but not Katie.
  - B: Only Katie (20%) - Misunderstanding of Katie's claim.
  - C: Both Tom and Katie (10%) - Lack of understanding of either.
  - D: Neither is correct (30%) - Recognize both are incorrect or not sure.

- **Basic**: Students at this level can handle basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They should be able to see Tom's claim works but might be tricked into thinking Katie's could work with some manipulation.
  - A: Only Tom (60%) 
  - B: Only Katie (15%) 
  - C: Both Tom and Katie (5%) 
  - D: Neither is correct (20%)

- **Proficient**: Students here have a good grasp of algebra and can easily verify both claims. They should see Tom's claim fits perfectly but recognize Katie's does not.
  - A: Only Tom (80%) 
  - B: Only Katie (5%) 
  - C: Both Tom and Katie (2%) 
  - D: Neither is correct (13%)

- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the algebra but can also critically evaluate the claims with ease. They'll quickly verify Tom's claim and dismiss Katie's.
  - A: Only Tom (90%) 
  - B: Only Katie (2%) 
  - C: Both Tom and Katie (1%) 
  - D: Neither is correct (7%)

The best answer is below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=15% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=2% D=13%
advanced: A=90% B=2% C=1% D=7%
