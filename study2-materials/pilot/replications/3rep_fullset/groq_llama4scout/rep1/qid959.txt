To approach this question, let's analyze the graph and the options provided, considering what each section of the graph represents in terms of distance and time, and how students at different ability levels might interpret the graph.

The graph shows three sections:
1. A line with a positive gradient, indicating Jodie is moving away from home.
2. A horizontal line, indicating Jodie is not changing her distance from home (she has stopped moving).
3. A line with a negative gradient, indicating Jodie is moving back towards home.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- A: Jodie is accelerating. Acceleration would be represented by a change in the gradient of the distance-time graph, not a horizontal section. This option might be tempting for students who confuse acceleration with movement or don't fully understand its representation on a distance-time graph.
- B: Jodie is walking away from home. This corresponds to the first section of the graph.
- C: Jodie is walking towards home. This corresponds to the third section of the graph.
- D: Jodie has stopped walking. This corresponds to the second section of the graph.

Given the context and the information directly inferable from the graph:

## Step 1: Understanding the Graph
The graph clearly shows Jodie moving away from home (first section), then stopping (second section), and finally moving back towards home (third section).

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A mentions acceleration, which would be more appropriately discussed in terms of velocity change over time, typically represented on a velocity-time graph. However, in a distance-time graph, acceleration isn't directly represented; instead, the gradient represents velocity. A change in gradient indicates acceleration. This concept might be tricky for below_basic and basic students.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with interpreting graphs and understanding the concepts of distance, time, and velocity. They might be confused by the graph and the options.
  - A: 20% (misinterpreting the graph for acceleration)
  - B: 30% (identify the first part of the graph correctly)
  - C: 20% (identify the third part of the graph correctly)
  - D: 30% (identify the second part of the graph correctly)
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with abstract concepts.
  - A: 10% (less likely to confuse with acceleration)
  - B: 40% (recognize walking away from home)
  - C: 30% (recognize walking towards home)
  - D: 20% (recognize stopping)
- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and can apply them.
  - A: 5% (clear understanding that acceleration isn't directly represented)
  - B: 45% (clearly understand the graph's first section)
  - C: 40% (clearly understand the graph's third section)
  - D: 10% (clearly understand the graph's second section)
- **Advanced**: These students not only understand the concepts but can also analyze and apply them critically.
  - A: 0% (no confusion with acceleration in this context)
  - B: 50% (very clear on the first section)
  - C: 45% (very clear on the third section)
  - D: 5% (very clear on the second section)

The best answer is D.
