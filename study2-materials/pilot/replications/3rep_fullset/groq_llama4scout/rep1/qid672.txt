To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question of how many degrees are there in three-quarters of a turn, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or ease of calculation.

The question requires students to understand that a full turn is 360 degrees. Therefore, three-quarters of a turn would be \(\frac{3}{4} \times 360 = 270\) degrees.

- **below_basic**: Students at this level may struggle with fractions and degrees. They might confuse the fraction of a turn with the degree measure directly or misunderstand the multiplication. 
  - A: \(75\degree\) might seem too low but could be a miscalculation. 
  - B: \(90\degree\) could seem reasonable for a quarter turn, but not three-quarters.
  - C: \(180\degree\) might seem like half a turn, which could confuse some.
  - D: \(270\degree\) is the correct answer but might not be reached by many due to calculation errors.

  Predicted distribution: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%

- **basic**: Students here have a basic understanding of fractions and angles. They might make straightforward calculation errors.
  - A: \(75\degree\) seems too low.
  - B: \(90\degree\) seems too low for three-quarters.
  - C: \(180\degree\) is half a turn.
  - D: \(270\degree\) seems correct but let's see.

  Predicted distribution: A=5% B=10% C=20% D=65%

- **proficient**: Students at this level should confidently calculate \(\frac{3}{4} \times 360\).
  - The correct calculation yields \(270\degree\), and most should get it right.

  Predicted distribution: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%

- **advanced**: These students not only calculate correctly but also understand the relationship between fractions of a turn and degrees intuitively.

  Predicted distribution: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

So, adjusting predictions to reflect potential minor errors even at higher levels:

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=20% D=65%
proficient: A=0% B=0% C=2% D=98%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
