## Step 1: Understanding the question
The question asks for the ratio of how much of a film James and Cameron have watched to how much they have yet to see, given that they paused it with one sixth left to watch.

## 2: Identifying the key information
They have one sixth of the film left to watch, which means they have watched five sixths of the film.

## 3: Calculating the ratio
The ratio of how much they have watched to how much they have yet to see is 5/6 : 1/6. Simplifying this ratio gives 5:1.

## 4: Analyzing potential misconceptions
A common misconception could be confusing the parts of the film watched and left to watch. However, the question explicitly states they have one sixth left, which should help guide students to the correct calculation.

## 5: Evaluating option attractiveness
- Option A (5:1) is the correct answer based on the calculation.
- Option B (1:5) could be a misunderstanding where students think about the ratio of what they've seen to what they haven't but get the order or values wrong.
- Option C (6:1) might seem plausible if students incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the fractions.
- Option D (1:6) directly reflects the fraction of the film left to watch but doesn't address the ratio of watched to not watched.

## 6: Predicting student responses by ability level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with fractions and ratios. They might choose D (1:6) because it directly reflects a part of the information given (1/6 left), or they might randomly select an option. A=10%, B=15%, C=20%, D=55%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple calculation errors. They are likely to choose A (5:1) but could be tempted by B (1:5) or C (6:1) if they misinterpret the question. A=70%, B=15%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of ratios and fractions. They should easily identify the correct ratio. A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them quickly. They are less likely to make errors. A=95%, B=2%, C=2%, D=1%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=20% D=55%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=2% D=1%
