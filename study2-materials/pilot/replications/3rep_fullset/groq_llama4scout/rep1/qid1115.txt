To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or understanding required.

The question requires identifying a quadratic equation that will give no real solutions. A quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) has no real solutions when its discriminant, \(b^2 - 4ac\), is less than 0. 

## Step 1: Understanding the Condition for No Real Solutions
For a quadratic equation to have no real solutions, the expression under the square root in the quadratic formula, \( \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), must be negative, i.e., \(b^2 - 4ac < 0\). 

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A is \( \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{-12}}{3} \). Here, \( \sqrt{-12} \) implies that the discriminant is negative, which means this equation has no real solutions.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B is \( \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{12}}{-3} \). The expression under the square root is positive, so this equation has real solutions.

## 4: Analyzing Option C
Option C is \( \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{1200}}{3} \). The expression under the square root is positive, indicating this equation also has real solutions.

## 5: Analyzing Option D
Option D is \( \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{0}}{3} \). This equation has one real solution because \( \sqrt{0} = 0 \), resulting in a repeated root.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with the concept of the discriminant and may not fully understand the implications of a negative under the square root. They might be drawn to options that seem to offer straightforward calculations or might not recognize the significance of a negative under the square root. Option A directly shows a negative under the square root, which might be confusing or seem "wrong" to them, leading them to potentially choose B or C due to a lack of understanding. **A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%**
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of basic quadratic equations but might still make errors in identifying the discriminant's role. They might recognize that a negative under the square root (Option A) means no real solutions but could be misled by the presentation of other options. **A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%**
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the quadratic formula and the discriminant. They should easily identify Option A as the one with no real solutions because it directly presents a negative value under the square root. **A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%**
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand the concept but can also quickly analyze the given options. They will certainly choose Option A as it explicitly shows a scenario with no real solutions due to the negative under the square root. **A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=15% D=5%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
