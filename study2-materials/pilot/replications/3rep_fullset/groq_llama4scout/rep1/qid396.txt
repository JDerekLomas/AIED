To approach this question, let's first understand what Eliza is trying to do and what the correct process entails. Eliza has two equations:

1) \( -6g - 2h = -2 \)
2) \( g - 2h = 10 \)

She decides to add them together. To do this correctly, we need to add the corresponding parts of each equation:

\( (-6g - 2h) + (g - 2h) = -2 + 10 \)

This simplifies to:

\( -6g + g - 2h - 2h = 8 \)

Which further simplifies to:

\( -5g - 4h = 8 \)

So, the correct result of adding the two equations together is \( -5g - 4h = 8 \).

Now, let's analyze the options given:

A) \( -5g - 4h = 12 \)  
B) \( 5g = 8 \)  
C) \( -7g = 8 \)  
D) \( -5g - 4h = 8 \)

The correct answer is D) \( -5g - 4h = 8 \).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The question tests the ability to perform a simple algebraic operation (adding two equations) correctly. A common misconception might involve incorrect handling of the variables or constants during the addition process.

## 2: Analyzing Student Responses by Ability Level

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may struggle with basic algebraic manipulations. They might incorrectly add the terms or fail to understand the process of adding equations. Given the simplicity of the operation required, a significant portion might still get it wrong due to a lack of foundational skills.

- **Basic:** Students at this level have a grasp of basic algebra but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to understand the concept of adding equations but could still struggle with executing it correctly, especially if they are not paying close attention to the signs and coefficients.

- **Proficient:** Students at this level should be able to perform the operation correctly with ease, understanding both the concept and the algebraic process. However, some might still fall into traps if they misread the equations or made computational errors.

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the algebraic process but are also likely to have a strong grasp of the underlying mathematical concepts. They are less likely to make errors in simple algebraic manipulations.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses

Given the straightforward nature of the question and the operation involved, most students, even those who are not advanced, should be able to get it right if they follow the procedure carefully.

## 4: Assigning Percentages

- **Below Basic:** A=20% (some might mistakenly calculate and get close but wrong option), B=10% (unlikely but could result from a gross misunderstanding), C=10% (similarly unlikely), D=60% (correct answer, but might require careful consideration).
- **Basic:** A=10%, B=5%, C=5%, D=80%.
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=2%, C=2%, D=91%.
- **Advanced:** A=2%, B=1%, C=1%, D=96%.

The best answer is D. 

below_basic: A=20% B=10% C=10% D=60%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
proficient: A=5% B=2% C=2% D=91%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=1% D=96%
