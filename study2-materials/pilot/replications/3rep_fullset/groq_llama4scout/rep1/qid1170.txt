To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question about a right-angled triangle, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls or ease of understanding for students at different levels.

The question presents a right-angled triangle with sides labeled \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), where \(a\) is the height, \(b\) is the base, and \(c\) is the hypotenuse. The task is to choose the correct formula for finding side \(a\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\(c\)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (\(a\) and \(b\)). This is expressed as \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\). To find \(a\), we rearrange this formula to solve for \(a\): \(a^2 = c^2 - b^2\).

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(a = c - b\). This is incorrect because it suggests a simple subtraction, which does not account for the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle.
- Option B: \(a^2 = b^2 + c^2\). This is incorrect because it incorrectly states the Pythagorean Theorem; \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\), not \(a^2 = b^2 + c^2\).
- Option C: \(a^2 = b^2 - c^2\). This would be incorrect because it implies \(a\) is longer than \(b\), which cannot be the case if \(c\) is the hypotenuse.
- Option D: \(a^2 = c^2 - b^2\). This correctly rearranges the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for \(a\).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level may not fully understand the Pythagorean Theorem or may confuse the formulas. They might be tempted by simple or seemingly logical (but incorrect) formulas.
  - A: 30% (simple subtraction seems intuitive but wrong)
  - B: 20% (misapplication of the theorem)
  - C: 20% (another misapplication)
  - D: 30% (correct, but might be guessed or understood through elimination)
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still make errors.
  - A: 15% (less likely to fall for simple subtraction)
  - B: 10% (less likely to misapply the theorem in this way)
  - C: 15% (still a plausible incorrect choice)
  - D: 60% (correct application of the theorem)
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of the Pythagorean Theorem.
  - A: 5% (unlikely to make such a basic error)
  - B: 5% (understands the theorem correctly)
  - C: 5% (recognizes this as incorrect)
  - D: 85% (confidently applies the theorem)
- **Advanced:** Students at this level are highly confident in their mathematical abilities.
  - A: 0% (would not make such a basic error)
  - B: 0% (knows the correct theorem)
  - C: 0% (sees through the incorrect option)
  - D: 100% (easily and correctly applies the theorem)

The best answer is D. 

Below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
Basic: A=15% B=10% C=15% D=60%
Proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
Advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
