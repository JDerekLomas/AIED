To predict how students at different ability levels might respond to this question, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question involves understanding the concept of negative numbers and applying it to a real-world scenario (moving between floors in a building). The gym is on floor \(-1\), and John's flat is on floor \(4\). To find out how many floors John needs to go down to get to the gym, we calculate the difference between his current floor and the gym's floor: \(4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception might involve incorrectly calculating the difference or misunderstanding the direction of movement (up or down) based on the negative sign. However, given that the question clearly states John needs to go "down," the main challenge lies in correctly applying the arithmetic.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(5\) floors down, which is the correct calculation (\(4 - (-1) = 5\)).
- Option B: \(3\) floors down.
- Option C: \(6\) floors down (incorrectly adding 1 to the wrong initial difference, perhaps starting from a miscalculation).
- Option D: \(4\) floors down, which might suggest simply taking the floor number of John's flat without accounting for the gym's floor correctly.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with negative numbers and basic arithmetic operations. A significant proportion might choose an option based on a misunderstanding of negative numbers or simply not perform the calculation correctly. Given the straightforward nature of the arithmetic once understood, \(A=10\%\), \(B=40\%\), \(C=20\%\), \(D=30\%\).
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding of arithmetic but may still struggle with the application of negative numbers. They are more likely to perform the calculation but might make errors due to not fully grasping the concept of moving down from a positive to a negative floor. \(A=50\%\), \(B=20\%\), \(C=15\%\), \(D=15\%\).
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are expected to understand and apply basic arithmetic operations, including those involving negative numbers. They should easily recognize that going from floor \(4\) to \(-1\) involves a \(5\)-floor descent. \(A=80\%\), \(B=10\%\), \(C=5\%\), \(D=5\%\).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the arithmetic but are also less likely to fall into common misconceptions. They should almost universally choose the correct option. \(A=95\%\), \(B=3\%\), \(C=1\%\), \(D=1\%\).

## 4: Final Predictions
Given these considerations, here's how the predictions might look:

below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=50% B=20% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
