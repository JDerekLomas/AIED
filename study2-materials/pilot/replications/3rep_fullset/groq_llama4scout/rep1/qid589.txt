## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents an irregular quadrilateral with four angles labeled as \( s \), \( 2s \), \( 2s \), and \( 3s \). The task is to find the size of angle \( s \).

## 2: Identifying the Key Concept
The key concept here is that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \( 360^\circ \). This fact can be used to solve for \( s \).

## 3: Setting Up the Equation
Given the angles \( s \), \( 2s \), \( 2s \), and \( 3s \), we can write the equation: \( s + 2s + 2s + 3s = 360^\circ \). Simplifying, we get \( 8s = 360^\circ \).

## 4: Solving for \( s \)
Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( s \): \( s = 360^\circ / 8 = 45^\circ \).

## 5: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 45^{\circ} \)
- Option B: \( 51.4^{\circ} \)
- Option C: \( 60^{\circ} \)
- Option D: Not enough information

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with setting up the equation or might not understand that the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is \( 360^\circ \). They might choose an option that seems plausible or guess. Given the straightforward calculation, some might still get it right, but errors are likely. A=40%, B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here should have a good grasp of basic geometry. They might make simple arithmetic mistakes but should recognize the equation. A=60%, B=15%, C=15%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students should easily solve the equation and choose the correct answer. A=80%, B=5%, C=5%, D=10%.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level will quickly and accurately solve for \( s \) and are unlikely to consider incorrect options. A=90%, B=2%, C=2%, D=6%.
