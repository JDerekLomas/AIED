## Step 1: Analyzing the question and understanding the pie chart
The pie chart shows the colours of motorbikes in a shop, with 1 section black, 1 section white, 3 sections green, and 3 sections blue, making a total of 8 sections. This implies that the distribution of bikes is 1/8 black, 1/8 white, 3/8 green, and 3/8 blue.

## 2: Identifying the relationship between blue and white bikes
We are told there are 30 more blue bikes than white bikes. Since blue bikes make up 3/8 of the total and white bikes make up 1/8 of the total, the difference between the number of blue and white bikes is 2/8 of the total number of bikes.

## 3: Setting up the equation based on the given information
Let \(T\) be the total number of bikes. The number of blue bikes is \(\frac{3}{8}T\) and the number of white bikes is \(\frac{1}{8}T\). We know that \(\frac{3}{8}T - \frac{1}{8}T = 30\). Simplifying, we get \(\frac{2}{8}T = 30\), which further simplifies to \(\frac{1}{4}T = 30\).

## 4: Solving for \(T\)
To find \(T\), we multiply both sides by 4: \(T = 30 \times 4 = 120\).

## 5: Predicting student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with understanding the pie chart, fractions, and setting up equations. They might choose an option without calculation or pick an obviously incorrect answer like B=15, as it seems too simple. Given the straightforward nature of the calculation once the relationship is understood, they might not accurately solve it but could guess or miscalculate. Therefore, A=20% (correct but through guesswork or simple error), B=40% (misconception or simple math error), C=10% (overestimation), D=30% (another guess).

- **Basic**: Students here can understand the relationships and set up simple equations but might make calculation errors. They are more likely to attempt solving it: A=60% (correct solution), B=20% (error in calculation or misunderstanding), C=10% (miscalculation), D=10% (miscalculation).

- **Proficient**: These students can easily solve the problem with confidence. They understand fractions and can set up and solve the equation accurately: A=80% (correct), B=5% (careless mistake), C=5% (error), D=10% (distraction by other options).

- **Advanced**: Students at this level can quickly and accurately solve the problem. The question might seem straightforward to them: A=90% (correct), B=0% (unlikely to make such a basic error), C=5% (potential for a more complex miscalculation), D=5% (unlikely but possible if overthinking).

## 6: Finalizing predictions
Given the specific numbers and the simplicity of the solution once understood, most students should be able to get the correct answer or understand where they went wrong.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
