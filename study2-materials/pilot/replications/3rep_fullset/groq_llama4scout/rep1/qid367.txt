To approach this question, let's consider the properties of reflections in geometry, specifically reflections over a line. When a point is reflected over a line, it is essentially flipped over that line, with the line acting as a mirror. The distance of the point from the line remains the same, but on the opposite side.

Given the grid and the rectangle with points P and Q, and a vertical line of reflection:

- **Point P** is 3 squares to the left of the red line (the line of reflection) and 3 squares up from the bottom of the grid. 
- **Point Q** is directly on the red line and 3 squares up from the bottom of the grid.

## Step 1: Analyze Point P's Reflection
When reflecting point P over the vertical red line, point P will move from being 3 squares to the left of the line to being 3 squares to the right of the line. Therefore, point P does not stay in the same position after the reflection.

## 2: Analyze Point Q's Reflection
Point Q is on the line of reflection. When a point is on the line of reflection, its reflection is itself. Therefore, point Q stays in the same position after the reflection.

## 3: Evaluate Tom and Katie's Statements
- Tom says point P stays in the same position after reflection, which is incorrect.
- Katie says point Q stays in the same position after reflection, which is correct.

## 4: Determine the Correct Answer
Given the analysis, the correct answer is that only Katie is correct. This corresponds to option B.

## 5: Predict Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding reflections or might not engage with the question properly. They might be more likely to choose an option randomly or based on a misunderstanding. Given the simplicity of the question once understood, they might lean towards incorrect options, but a significant portion might choose B if they grasp the concept of reflection at all. Let's assume A=20%, B=40%, C=10%, D=30%.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding of geometry. They might still make errors, especially if they misunderstand the concept of reflection. A notable portion might realize Katie is correct but not necessarily understand Tom's incorrectness fully. Let's assume A=10%, B=60%, C=15%, D=15%.
- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of geometric concepts, including reflections. They should easily identify that Katie is correct and Tom is not. Let's assume A=5%, B=80%, C=10%, D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand reflections but can also apply them accurately in various contexts. They would quickly recognize Katie's correctness and Tom's incorrectness. Let's assume A=0%, B=90%, C=5%, D=5%.

The final answer is: 
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=60% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
