To approach this question, let's first analyze the content and then consider the potential misconceptions and the understanding required at different levels of ability.

The question revolves around solving simultaneous equations and the method of eliminating a variable by either adding or subtracting the equations. The given equations are:
\[ \begin{array}{l}3 x-2 y=15 \\ x+2 y=20\end{array} \]

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
To determine who is correct, we need to see what happens when we add or subtract these two equations.

## 2: Adding the Equations
If we add the two equations:
\[ (3x - 2y) + (x + 2y) = 15 + 20 \]
\[ 3x + x - 2y + 2y = 35 \]
\[ 4x = 35 \]
\[ x = \frac{35}{4} \]
This shows that adding the equations eliminates \(y\), not \(x\), because the \(y\) terms cancel out.

## 3: Subtracting the Equations
If we subtract the second equation from the first:
\[ (3x - 2y) - (x + 2y) = 15 - 20 \]
\[ 3x - x - 2y - 2y = -5 \]
\[ 2x - 4y = -5 \]
This does not directly help without further manipulation, but let's check if subtracting eliminates a variable directly:
\[ (3x - 2y) - (x + 2y) = 2x - 4y \]
It seems that subtracting directly doesn't eliminate a variable in a straightforward manner as adding does for \(y\).

## 4: Analyzing Katie's Statement
For Katie to be correct, subtracting should eliminate a variable:
\[ (3x - 2y) - (x + 2y) = 2x - 4y \]
This doesn't eliminate \(x\) or \(y\) directly in a simple manner. Let's correct the approach:
If we want to eliminate \(x\) by subtracting, we'd do:
\[ (3x - 2y) - 3(x + 2y) = 15 - 3*20 \]
But that's not what Katie suggested.

## 5: Evaluating Tom's Statement
Tom says adding eliminates a variable. Let's see:
\[ (3x - 2y) + (x + 2y) = 15 + 20 \]
\[ 4x = 35 \]
Indeed, adding eliminates \(y\), making Tom correct.

## 6: Evaluating Katie's Statement Properly
Katie suggests subtracting eliminates a variable. Let's properly evaluate:
If we subtract:
\[ (x + 2y) - (3x - 2y) = 20 - 15 \]
\[ x + 2y - 3x + 2y = 5 \]
\[ -2x + 4y = 5 \]
Or,
\[ (3x - 2y) - (x + 2y) = 15 - 20 \]
\[ 2x - 4y = -5 \]
Neither directly eliminates a variable without further steps, but:
\[ (x + 2y) = 20 \]
\[ (3x - 2y) = 15 \]
Multiplying the second equation by 1 and the first by 3 to eliminate \(x\):
\[ 3(x + 2y) = 3*20 \]
\[ 3x + 6y = 60 \]
And
\[ (3x - 2y) = 15 \]
Subtracting these:
\[ (3x + 6y) - (3x - 2y) = 60 - 15 \]
\[ 8y = 45 \]
So, Katie is actually correct if we consider proper manipulation to eliminate variables.

## 7: Conclusion on Student Responses
Given the straightforward nature of the question and the simple manipulation required, most students should understand that:
- Adding the equations eliminates \(y\) (Tom is correct).
- With proper manipulation, subtracting can also eliminate a variable (Katie is correct).
