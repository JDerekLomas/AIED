To approach this question, let's break down the statements made by Tom and Katie and evaluate their validity based on properties of triangles.

1. **Tom says a triangle can have two right angles.**
   - This statement is false. A triangle can have only one right angle (a right-angled triangle). The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. If one angle is 90 degrees (a right angle), the sum of the other two angles must be 90 degrees as well, making it impossible for another angle to be 90 degrees.

2. **Katie says only a scalene triangle can have a right angle.**
   - This statement is also false. A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths and all angles of different sizes. However, having a right angle does not restrict a triangle to being scalene; a right-angled triangle can also be isosceles (if the two shorter sides are equal) or scalene (if all sides are of different lengths). For example, an isosceles right-angled triangle (45-45-90 triangle) has two equal sides and two equal angles, both being 45 degrees.

Given these explanations:

- Tom is incorrect because a triangle cannot have two right angles.
- Katie is incorrect because a right angle can be present in triangles that are not scalene (e.g., an isosceles right triangle).

Therefore, the correct answer is **D) Neither is correct**.

Now, let's predict the percentage of students at each ability level who might choose each option:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might not fully understand properties of triangles. They might be more likely to believe incorrect statements or not have the knowledge to refute them.
  - A=30% (Some might think Tom could be right due to lack of understanding)
  - B=20% (Might think Katie is right due to partial understanding of triangle types)
  - C=10% (Unlikely to think both are correct given their lack of understanding)
  - D=40% (Some might recognize both statements as incorrect)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might still struggle with nuanced concepts.
  - A=20% (Tom's statement is easily recognizable as wrong for most)
  - B=25% (Katie's statement might seem plausible to some)
  - C=5% (Few would think both are correct)
  - D=50% (Most would recognize both statements as incorrect)

- **Proficient:** These students have a solid grasp of geometric concepts.
  - A=5% (Quickly recognize Tom's error)
  - B=10% (Understand Katie's statement is too restrictive)
  - C=2% (Virtually none think both are correct)
  - D=83% (Easily see that neither statement is correct)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts to complex situations.
  - A=1% (Understand and reject Tom's statement)
  - B=2% (Recognize Katie's limitation)
  - C=0% (No one thinks both are correct)
  - D=97% (Almost all recognize the inaccuracies in both statements)

So, the predictions are:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=10% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=5% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=2% D=83%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=0% D=97%
