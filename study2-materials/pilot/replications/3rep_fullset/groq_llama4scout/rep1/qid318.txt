## Step 1: Understand the quadratic formula and its application
The quadratic formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\). For the equation \(3x^2 + 2x - 5 = 0\), \(a = 3\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = -5\).

## 2: Identify the correct substitution into the quadratic formula
Substituting \(a = 3\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = -5\) into the quadratic formula gives \(x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4(3)(-5)}}{2(3)}\). This simplifies to \(x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 60}}{6}\), which further simplifies to \(x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{64}}{6}\) and then \(x = \frac{-2 \pm 8}{6}\).

## 3: Analyze the options given
- Option A: \(-2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{2^{2}-4(3)(-5)}}{2(3)}\). This option incorrectly places the negative sign in front of the 2, outside the fraction.
- Option B: \(2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{2^{2}-4(3)(-5)}}{2(3)}\). This option incorrectly uses \(+2\) instead of \(-2\) and also incorrectly places the \(\pm\) before the fraction.
- Option C: \(\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^{2}-4(3)(-5)}}{2(3)}\). This option is correct as it properly substitutes \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the quadratic formula.
- Option D: \(\frac{2 \pm \sqrt{2^{2}-4(3)(-5)}}{2(3)}\). This option uses \(+2\) instead of \(-2\), which is incorrect.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with substituting into the formula and could easily confuse the signs or the positions of the numbers. They might choose options that seem simpler or more intuitive, such as B or D, due to not understanding the formula's structure. Option A might appeal due to its simplicity but is incorrect. **A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%**
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a basic understanding of the quadratic formula but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to recognize the correct structure but could confuse the sign of \(b\). Thus, they might be more inclined to choose C but could also consider A or D. **A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%**
- **Proficient**: Students at this level are familiar with the quadratic formula and can apply it correctly. They are less likely to make mistakes with the signs and positions. They should predominantly choose C. **A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%**
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only know the formula but also understand its implications and can solve equations efficiently. They would easily identify the correct option and are less likely to consider incorrect ones. **A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
