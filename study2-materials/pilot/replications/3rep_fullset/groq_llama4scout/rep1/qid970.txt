## Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks to solve a pair of simultaneous equations: \( \begin{array}{l}3 x+2 y=14 \\ 2 x+2 y=10\end{array} \). This requires either substitution or elimination method to find the values of \(x\) and \(y\).

## 2: Solve the equations
To solve these equations, let's use the elimination method for simplicity. First, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \(y\):
\[ (3x + 2y) - (2x + 2y) = 14 - 10 \]
\[ 3x - 2x + 2y - 2y = 4 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

## 3: Solve for \(y\)
Now, substitute \(x = 4\) into one of the original equations to solve for \(y\). Using \(2x + 2y = 10\):
\[ 2(4) + 2y = 10 \]
\[ 8 + 2y = 10 \]
\[ 2y = 2 \]
\[ y = 1 \]

## 4: Analyze the options
Given the solution \(x = 4\) and \(y = 1\), let's look at the options:
- A: \(x = 5, y = -0.5\)
- B: \(x = 4, y = 2\)
- C: \(x = 4, y = 1\)
- D: \(x = 1, y = 4\)

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with solving simultaneous equations or make calculation errors. They might not correctly solve for \(x\) and \(y\) or might not even attempt to solve them correctly. Given the straightforward nature of this question once the method is understood, they might be more likely to guess or make significant errors. Option C is the correct answer, so they might have a lower chance of selecting it. Let's assume A=20%, B=20%, C=30%, D=30%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level can solve simple simultaneous equations but might make errors in more complex calculations or with negative numbers. They have a decent chance of getting this right but might be tempted by obviously incorrect options. Let's assume A=10%, B=15%, C=60%, D=15%.
- **Proficient**: Students here are comfortable with solving simultaneous equations using various methods. They are likely to get this question correct. Let's assume A=5%, B=5%, C=85%, D=5%.
- **Advanced**: These students are not only proficient but also understand the underlying concepts deeply. They are very likely to solve the equations correctly and quickly. Let's assume A=0%, B=0%, C=95%, D=5%.

## 6: Format the response
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
- advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=60% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
