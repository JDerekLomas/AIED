To approach this question, let's break it down into its components and consider the potential pitfalls and the level of difficulty it presents to students at different ability levels.

The question requires converting a Roman numeral (CCXLIX) into an integer. Roman numerals can be tricky for some students, especially those who are not familiar with the rules or have difficulty remembering them. The Roman numeral CCXLIX can be broken down as follows: CC = 200, XL = 40, and IX = 9. Adding these together gives 200 + 40 + 9 = 249.

## Step 1: Understanding the Roman Numeral
The Roman numeral CCXLIX translates to 200 (CC) + 40 (XL) + 9 (IX) = 249.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve misinterpreting the Roman numerals, especially the subtractive notation (like XL for 40 and IX for 9). Students might mistakenly add instead of subtract or misread the numerals.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- A: 271
- B: 269
- C: 249
- D: 259

Given the correct conversion is 249, let's consider how students at different levels might perform:

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle significantly with Roman numerals. They might not understand the subtractive principle (e.g., IX for 9) or might add all components without considering the subtraction (e.g., 200 + 40 + 10 = 250, then guessing). Given the options, a mistake like adding 10 instead of 9 could lead to D = 259 being a plausible incorrect answer. 
  - A=10% B=5% C=60% D=25%

- **Basic:** Students here have a basic understanding but might still make simple errors. They know the basic Roman numerals but might misapply the rules or make calculation mistakes.
  - A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%

- **Proficient:** These students have a good grasp of Roman numerals and are less likely to make errors in conversion. They understand the rules and can apply them accurately.
  - A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%

- **Advanced:** Advanced students are very comfortable with Roman numerals and complex conversions. They are highly unlikely to make mistakes.
  - A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%

## 5: Finalizing Predictions
Given these considerations, the predictions can be summarized as follows:

below_basic: A=10% B=5% C=60% D=25%
basic: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%
