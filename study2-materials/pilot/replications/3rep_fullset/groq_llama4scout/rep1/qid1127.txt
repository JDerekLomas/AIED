## Step 1: Analyze the question
The question requires students to simplify the expression \( \frac{4 t^{2}-4 t-48}{8} \times \frac{2}{t-4} \) into a single fraction as simply as possible. The expression can be simplified by first factoring the quadratic equation \( 4 t^{2}-4 t-48 \) and then performing the multiplication.

## 2: Factor the quadratic equation
The quadratic equation \( 4 t^{2}-4 t-48 \) can be factored as \( 4(t^{2}-t-12) \), which further factors into \( 4(t-4)(t+3) \).

## 3: Simplify the given expression
Substituting the factored form into the original expression gives \( \frac{4(t-4)(t+3)}{8} \times \frac{2}{t-4} \). This simplifies to \( \frac{(t-4)(t+3)}{2} \times \frac{2}{t-4} \), which simplifies further to \( t+3 \) after cancelling out \( (t-4) \) and \( 2 \).

## 4: Evaluate the answer choices
- A: \( \frac{4 t^{2}-4 t-48}{4(t-4)} \) simplifies to \( \frac{(t-4)(t+3)}{t-4} \) which is \( t+3 \) but doesn't directly match the simplified form without factoring.
- B: \( t+3 \) matches the correct simplification.
- C: \( \frac{t^{2}-t-12}{t-4} \) can be factored into \( \frac{(t-4)(t+3)}{t-4} \) which simplifies to \( t+3 \), but it doesn't account for the initial simplification directly.
- D: \( t-3 \) is incorrect based on the simplification.

## 5: Consider student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with factoring and simplifying expressions. They might not correctly factor \( 4 t^{2}-4 t-48 \) or might not see how to cancel terms, potentially leading them to choose A or C if they attempt to simplify but make errors.
- **Basic**: Students here might understand basic algebraic manipulations but could still struggle with cancelling terms or might not fully factor the quadratic, potentially leading to incorrect choices like A or C.
- **Proficient**: These students should be able to factor the quadratic and simplify the expression correctly, likely choosing B.
- **Advanced**: Students at this level should easily simplify the expression and choose B, with a deep understanding of why other options are incorrect.

## 6: Predict percentages for each ability level
Given the simplicity of the correct answer once the expression is properly factored and simplified:
- **Below Basic**: A=30% (incomplete simplification), B=20% (correct but unlikely), C=30% (partially correct but not simplified), D=20% (completely incorrect).
- **Basic**: A=20% (missed simplification), B=50% (correct), C=20% (partial simplification), D=10% (incorrect).
- **Proficient**: A=10% (error in simplification), B=80% (correct), C=5% (rare mistake), D=5% (incorrect).
- **Advanced**: A=5% (unlikely mistake), B=90% (correct), C=3% (rare error), D=2% (very unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=50% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
