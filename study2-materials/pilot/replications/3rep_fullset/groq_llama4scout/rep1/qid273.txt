To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions related to angles.

The question presents two angles, \(a\) and \(b\), that meet on a straight line. A fundamental property of angles is that those forming a straight line add up to \(180^\circ\). This is a basic concept in geometry that students typically learn early on.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconceptions
- A common misconception might be that angles on a straight line add up to \(360^\circ\) (option B), which is actually the sum of angles around a point.
- Another misconception could be that the two angles are equal (option C), which is not necessarily true unless specifically stated that the angles are equal or that the line is divided into two equal parts by the vertex of the angles.
- Option D (\(a+b=90^\circ\)) suggests the angles form a right angle, which is incorrect for angles on a straight line.

## 2: Analyzing the Question's Difficulty
The question seems straightforward, testing the basic property that angles on a straight line add up to \(180^\circ\). For students familiar with basic geometry, this should not be a challenging question.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level

### below_basic
Students at this level may struggle with basic geometric concepts. They might not recall that angles on a straight line add up to \(180^\circ\).
- A: \(60\%\) (some might remember the basic property)
- B: \(20\%\) (confusing with angles around a point)
- C: \(10\%\) (incorrect assumption of equality)
- D: \(10\%\) (thinking of a right angle)

### basic
Students at this level have a grasp of basic geometric properties but might make occasional mistakes.
- A: \(80\%\) (most recall the property)
- B: \(10\%\) (still some confusion with \(360^\circ\))
- C: \(5\%\) (less likely to assume equality)
- D: \(5\%\) (less likely to think of \(90^\circ\))

### proficient
Students at this level have a solid understanding of geometric concepts and are less likely to make simple mistakes.
- A: \(95\%\) (strong recall of the property)
- B: \(3\%\) (rarely confuse with \(360^\circ\))
- C: \(1\%\) (unlikely to assume equality)
- D: \(1\%\) (unlikely to think of \(90^\circ\))

### advanced
Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts easily.
- A: \(99\%\) (property well ingrained)
- B: \(0.5\%\) (very rarely confuse with \(360^\circ\))
- C: \(0.25\%\) (extremely unlikely to assume equality)
- D: \(0.25\%\) (extremely unlikely to think of \(90^\circ\))

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
basic: A=80% B=10% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
advanced: A=99% B=0.5% C=0.25% D=0.25%
