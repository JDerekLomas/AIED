To approach this question, let's first understand what's being asked and the common misconceptions associated with solving quadratic equations.

The equation given is \(p^{2} - 16 = p\). To solve this equation using the quadratic formula, it needs to be in the standard form of \(ap^2 + bp + c = 0\). 

## Step 1: Identify the current form of the equation
The equation is \(p^{2} - 16 = p\), which can be rewritten as \(p^{2} - p - 16 = 0\).

## 2: Determine the necessary step to use the quadratic formula
To use the quadratic formula, the equation must be in the form \(ap^2 + bp + c = 0\). The given equation can be easily rearranged into this form by subtracting \(p\) from both sides and then adding \(16\) to both sides, but actually, it's already in the correct form if we rearrange it as \(p^2 - p - 16 = 0\). However, the question seems to ask for an initial step before applying the formula, implying we look for how to get it into standard form from its current state.

## 3: Analyze the options given
- A: Squaring root everything is incorrect because it doesn't apply here; we're trying to get the equation into a standard quadratic form, not solve for \(p\).
- B: Adding \(16\) to both sides would help but isn't the direct step needed; the equation can be directly rearranged.
- C: Dividing everything by \(p\) would change the equation and isn't necessary; it could also lead to division by zero if \(p = 0\).
- D: Subtracting \(p\) from both sides directly rearranges the equation into the standard quadratic form.

## 4: Consider common student misconceptions and abilities
- Students who are below_basic might not fully understand the quadratic formula or how to rearrange equations, potentially leading them to incorrect options like A or C.
- Basic students might understand the need to rearrange but could be tricked into thinking they need to isolate terms or apply operations not required.
- Proficient students should easily see that rearranging into standard form is key and choose D.
- Advanced students would likely quickly identify the correct step and potentially see through the distractors.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below_basic**: Might not fully grasp quadratic equations or rearrangement. Option D seems logically correct but let's assume they might struggle: A=30% (misconception of directly applying square root), B=20% (trying to isolate constants), C=20% (incorrect operation), D=30% (some understanding of rearranging).
- **Basic**: Should have a better grasp but might still make simple errors: A=10%, B=15%, C=10%, D=65%.
- **Proficient**: Should easily rearrange and know the formula's prerequisites: A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.
- **Advanced**: Would quickly and accurately choose the right option with minimal distraction: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=10% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
