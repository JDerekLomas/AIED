To approach this question, let's consider the concepts involved and how they might affect students at different ability levels.

Rotational symmetry in quadrilaterals refers to the number of times a quadrilateral can be rotated by a certain angle (a fraction of 360 degrees) and still look the same. 

- A quadrilateral with rotational symmetry of order 1 can be rotated once (or any multiple of 360 degrees) and look the same, which essentially means it looks the same after a full rotation. This applies to all quadrilaterals since rotating a quadrilateral by 360 degrees always results in it looking the same. Thus, every quadrilateral has an order of rotational symmetry of at least 1.
- A quadrilateral with rotational symmetry of order 3 would have to look the same after a rotation of 120 degrees (360/3), which is not characteristic of all quadrilaterals but could apply to specific types like certain kites or rhombi if they have the right angles and side lengths.

## Step 1: Understanding the Claims
Tom claims some quadrilaterals have an order of rotational symmetry of \(1\), which is true for all quadrilaterals since they all have rotational symmetry of order 1 (they look the same after a 360-degree rotation).
Katie claims some quadrilaterals have an order of rotational symmetry of \(3\), which can be true for specific quadrilaterals (like an equilateral triangle is not a quadrilateral, but a rhombus that is also a square has rotational symmetry of order 4; however, there are quadrilaterals, such as certain types of kites, that might exhibit higher symmetry).

## 2: Evaluating the Possibility of Errors
- The question essentially tests understanding of rotational symmetry. 
- Students below the basic level might struggle with the concept of rotational symmetry and could mistakenly think both are incorrect or that only one is correct without fully understanding why.
- Basic level students might understand that all quadrilaterals have rotational symmetry of order 1 but might not consider if any have order 3, potentially leading them to say only Tom is correct.
- Proficient students should understand that while all quadrilaterals have an order of 1, not all have an order of 3, but they might recognize specific quadrilaterals could have higher orders of symmetry.
- Advanced students should easily recognize that Tom is correct because all quadrilaterals have an order of rotational symmetry of at least 1, and they might know specific examples where Katie could be correct (like a square does not have order 3 but certain symmetric quadrilaterals could have higher orders).

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
Given these considerations:
- **Below Basic**: These students might not fully grasp the concept. They could randomly select or choose based on misunderstanding. A=40% (assuming some get it right by chance), B=20%, C=20%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here understand basic geometry. A=60% (recognizing Tom's correctness), B=20% (thinking only Katie), C=10%, D=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students have a solid grasp. A=80% (acknowledging Tom), B=5%, C=10% (recognizing both), D=5%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students understand deeply. A=90%, B=0%, C=5% (for completeness), D=5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=20% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
