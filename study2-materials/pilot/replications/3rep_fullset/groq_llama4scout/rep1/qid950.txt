To approach this question, let's first understand what a surd is. A surd is an irrational root of a number, often expressed as \(\sqrt{x}\) where \(x\) is not a perfect square. 

Now, let's analyze the options given:
A: \( \sqrt{45} \) - Since \(45 = 9 \times 5\) and \(9\) is a perfect square, \(\sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \times 5} = 3\sqrt{5}\), which is a surd.
B: \( \sqrt{47} \) - \(47\) is not a perfect square, so \(\sqrt{47}\) is a surd.
C: \( \sqrt{49} \) - Since \(49 = 7^2\), \(\sqrt{49} = 7\), which is not a surd because it is a rational number (a whole number, in this case).
D: \( \sqrt{51} \) - \(51\) is not a perfect square, so \(\sqrt{51}\) is a surd.

The question asks which of the following is not a surd. Based on the analysis, \( \sqrt{49} \) is the one that is not a surd.

Given this, let's predict the performance of students at different levels:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with the concept of surds and perfect squares. They might not easily identify \( \sqrt{49} \) as a perfect square or could get confused with the definition of a surd.
  - A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20% (They might pick any, with a slight inclination towards C because it's a perfect square, but not a clear understanding)

- **Basic:** At this level, students have a basic understanding of squares and square roots. They should recognize \( \sqrt{49} \) as \(7\), but might still be a bit uncertain about the other options.
  - A=15% B=20% C=50% D=15% (They have a better chance of getting it right, leaning towards C)

- **Proficient:** These students are expected to have a solid understanding of surds and perfect squares. They should easily identify \( \sqrt{49} \) as not a surd.
  - A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5% (They are likely to choose C correctly)

- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a deep understanding and can apply concepts easily. They would quickly identify \( \sqrt{49} \) as a rational number and not a surd.
  - A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5% (They are very likely to choose C correctly)

So, the predicted percentages are:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=20% C=50% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=5% C=90% D=5%
