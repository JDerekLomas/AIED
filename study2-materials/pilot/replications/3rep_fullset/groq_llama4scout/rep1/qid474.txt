To approach this question, let's consider the factors that influence the difficulty and the likelihood of students selecting incorrect options. The question requires students to factorize the quadratic expression \(x^{2} + 6x + 5\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The expression \(x^{2} + 6x + 5\) can be factorized into \((x + 1)(x + 5)\) because \(1 \times 5 = 5\) and \(1 + 5 = 6\). A common misconception might involve incorrect factorization or assuming it cannot be factorized.

## 2: Analyzing Option A
Option A, \((x+2)(x+3)\), suggests a factorization where \(2 \times 3 = 6\) and \(2 + 3 = 5\), which does not match our target expression. This option might attract students who mistakenly apply factorization rules or miscalculate the factors.

## 3: Analyzing Option B
Option B, "Cannot be factorised," might appeal to students who are unsure about how to factorize the quadratic expression or believe it doesn't factor nicely into integers.

## 4: Analyzing Option D
Option D, \(x(x+6)+5\), is essentially a different way of writing the original expression \(x^{2} + 6x + 5\), not a factorization. Students might choose this if they're struggling to see how to factor or if they're trying to manipulate the expression in a way that seems familiar.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** At this level, students might struggle significantly with factorization. They might be more likely to choose B (Cannot be factorised) because they don't know how to factor, or D, as it looks like a manipulation of the original expression but doesn't require understanding of factorization. C (the correct answer) might be less likely because it requires a specific insight into factors of 5 that add up to 6. A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebraic manipulations but might still struggle with factorization, especially if the numbers aren't straightforward. They might still be tempted by B or D but have a better chance of getting C. A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
- **Proficient:** Proficient students should be able to factorize \(x^{2} + 6x + 5\) with ease, recognizing it as \((x+1)(x+5)\). They are less likely to choose A, B, or D. A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are likely to have a strong grasp of algebra, including factorization. They would quickly identify C as the correct answer and avoid the misconceptions. A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%

## 6: Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
- **basic:** A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
- **proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
- **advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=10% B=40% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=30% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=90% D=0%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
