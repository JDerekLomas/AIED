To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \(2 \frac{2}{3} \div 2\), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties it may pose.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to divide a mixed number, \(2 \frac{2}{3}\), by 2. To solve this, students can convert the mixed number to an improper fraction: \(2 \frac{2}{3} = \frac{(2 \times 3) + 2}{3} = \frac{6 + 2}{3} = \frac{8}{3}\). Then, they divide by 2: \(\frac{8}{3} \div 2 = \frac{8}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3}\). Finally, converting \(\frac{4}{3}\) back to a mixed number: \(\frac{4}{3} = 1 \frac{1}{3}\).

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrect handling of the division, such as subtracting or adding instead of multiplying by the reciprocal of the divisor. However, the straightforward nature of this problem (involving a simple division by 2) might minimize such errors for proficient and advanced students.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \(1 \frac{1}{3}\) is the correct answer.
- Option B: \(1 \frac{2}{3}\) might seem plausible but is incorrect.
- Option C: \(2 \frac{1}{3}\) seems too large and is incorrect.
- Option D: \(\frac{3}{4}\) seems unrelated and is incorrect.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with converting mixed numbers to improper fractions, dividing fractions, or understanding the concept of division by a whole number. They might incorrectly choose B, C, or D due to a lack of understanding.
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but may still make errors in calculation or converting between mixed numbers and improper fractions. They might choose A (correct) but could also be tempted by B or C due to miscalculation.
- **Proficient:** These students are likely to understand the procedures well and choose A. Misconceptions are less likely, but they might still occur, especially if students rush or misinterpret the division.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level have a strong grasp of the concepts and are less likely to make errors. They should predominantly choose A.

## 5: Estimating Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question and assuming most students have a basic understanding of fractions and division:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (some get it right by chance or have a basic understanding), B=40%, C=20%, D=10%.
- **Basic:** A=70%, B=20%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient:** A=90%, B=5%, C=3%, D=2%.
- **Advanced:** A=98%, B=1%, C=0.5%, D=0.5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
