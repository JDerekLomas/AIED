To solve this, let's first identify what a cube number is. A cube number is the result of multiplying an integer by itself twice, i.e., \(n^3\) where \(n\) is an integer. Examples of cube numbers include \(1^3 = 1\), \(2^3 = 8\), \(3^3 = 27\), \(4^3 = 64\), and so on.

Now, let's examine the options given:

A: \(3\)
B: \(36\)
C: \(64\)
D: \(21\)

We need to determine if any of these are cube numbers.

- \(3\) is not a perfect cube (\(3^3 = 27\), not \(3\)).
- \(36\) is not a perfect cube (\(\sqrt[3]{36}\) is not an integer).
- \(64\) is \(4^3\), so it is a cube number.
- \(21\) is not a perfect cube (\(\sqrt[3]{21}\) is not an integer).

Only option C: \(64\) is a cube number because \(64 = 4^3\).

Given this analysis, let's predict the performance of students at different ability levels:

### below_basic
At this level, students may struggle with basic mathematical concepts and may not have a strong understanding of what constitutes a cube number. However, the question does not require complex calculations, just recognition.

- A: \(3\) might seem like a small, manageable number, but students at this level might not recognize it as not being a cube.
- B: \(36\) could be mistaken for a cube due to its square being \(6^2\), but not a cube.
- C: \(64\) is likely to be recognized as a cube by a few who remember perfect cubes or can calculate \(4^3\).
- D: \(21\) seems unlikely to be a cube.

Prediction: below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%

### basic
Students at this level have a better grasp of basic mathematical operations and concepts, including some understanding of powers and roots.

- A: Might still be considered by some.
- B: Less likely to be considered a cube.
- C: Should be recognizable as \(4^3\).
- D: Not considered a cube.

Prediction: basic: A=10% B=5% C=70% D=15%

### proficient
These students have a solid understanding of mathematical concepts, including powers and roots. They should easily recognize \(64\) as a cube.

Prediction: proficient: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%

### advanced
Advanced students not only understand but can apply and extend mathematical concepts. They would certainly recognize \(64\) as a cube.

Prediction: advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%

Therefore, the final prediction is:
below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=40% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=5% C=70% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=0% C=90% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%
