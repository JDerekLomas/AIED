To solve this, let's first understand the task: Peter starts counting up in threes from -16 and we need to find the 5th number he says.

## Step 1: Determine the sequence
Starting at -16, counting up in threes means we add 3 to get each successive number. So, the sequence starts as -16, -13, -10, -7, -4, ...

## 2: Identify the 5th number in the sequence
To find the 5th number, we start at -16 and add 3 four times (since the first number is -16, and we add 3 to get to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and then 5th numbers):
1. -16 (start)
2. -16 + 3 = -13
3. -13 + 3 = -10
4. -10 + 3 = -7
5. -7 + 3 = -4

So, the 5th number Peter says is -4.

## 3: Analyze potential misconceptions and difficulty
The question tests the ability to count in steps (in this case, threes) from a negative number. A common misconception could involve incorrect addition or subtraction of the increment (3 in this case) or misunderstanding the direction of counting (up or down). However, given that the question specifies "counting up," it clarifies the direction.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic addition and subtraction, especially with negative numbers. They might not accurately count up in threes or could get confused with the negative starting point. 
  - A: -28 (incorrect, but let's see if it's plausible): If they incorrectly subtract or add, this could happen. For example, subtracting 12 (4 steps of 3) from -16 gives -28.
  - B: -4 (correct)
  - C: -1 (incorrect)
  - D: -31 (incorrect, subtracting 15 from -16)

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple arithmetic errors.
  - A: Less likely to choose A, B seems correct but let's assume some errors.
  - B: High chance of getting this right.
  - C, D: Plausible errors if arithmetic mistakes are made.

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concept and can apply it accurately.
  - A, C, D: Low chance of choosing these incorrectly.
  - B: High chance of choosing correctly.

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand but can apply the concept with ease and accuracy.
  - B: Almost certain to choose correctly.

## 5: Assign Percentages
Given the straightforward nature of the question and assuming most students can handle counting up in threes from a negative number:
- **Below Basic:** A=30% (simple error), B=40% (getting it right or guessing), C=15%, D=15%
- **Basic:** A=15%, B=70%, C=5%, D=10%
- **Proficient:** A=5%, B=90%, C=2%, D=3%
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=98%, C=1%, D=1%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=15% B=70% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=98% C=1% D=1%
