To solve this, let's first convert all the fractions and decimals into a comparable format, such as decimals, to identify the outlier.

## Step 1: Convert fractions to decimals
- \( \frac{8}{10} = 0.8 \)
- \( \frac{41}{50} = 0.82 \)
- \( \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \)
- \( \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \)
- \( \frac{79}{100} = 0.79 \)

## 2: Identify the values in decimal form
- \( 0.8, 0.82, 0.35, 0.77, 0.8, 0.79 \)

## 3: Determine the outlier
The values cluster around 0.8, with 0.77, 0.79, 0.8, and 0.82 being close. The outlier is clearly \( 0.35 \) because it's significantly lower than all the other values.

## 4: Match the outlier to the original options
- \( \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \), which corresponds to option B.

## 5: Analyze the difficulty and potential misconceptions
This question requires students to either convert fractions to decimals or understand the relative sizes of fractions and decimals. The potential misconception could be in converting fractions to decimals or comparing them. However, given the numbers, most students should be able to see that \( \frac{7}{20} \) is less than 1/2 and significantly smaller than the others, making it the outlier.

## 6: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with conversions and comparisons. They might incorrectly identify the outlier due to miscalculation or misunderstanding of decimal/fraction conversion. \( B = 60\% \) (they might recognize it's smaller but could confuse with others), \( A = 15\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 15\% \).
- **Basic:** Students here should have a better grasp of fractions and decimals but might still make some errors. \( B = 80\% \), \( A = 10\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 5\% \).
- **Proficient:** These students should accurately convert and compare values. \( B = 90\% \), \( A = 5\% \), \( C = 3\% \), \( D = 2\% \).
- **Advanced:** Students at this level should quickly and accurately identify the outlier. \( B = 95\% \), \( A = 3\% \), \( C = 1\% \), \( D = 1\% \).

The best answer is B. 

below_basic: A=15% B=60% C=10% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=80% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=3% B=95% C=1% D=1%
