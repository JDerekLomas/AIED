## Step 1: Understand the task
The task is to predict the percentage of students at each ability level (below_basic, basic, proficient, advanced) who would choose each option (A, B, C, D) for the given question about completing the square.

## 2: Analyze the question
The question asks students to complete the square for the expression \(p^{2} - p - 1\) and find what should replace the star in \((p \bigstar)^{2}\).

## 3: Solve the expression
To complete the square for \(p^{2} - p - 1\), we take the coefficient of \(p\), which is \(-1\), divide it by 2, and then square it: \(\left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^{2} = \frac{1}{4}\). So, \(p^{2} - p + \frac{1}{4} = \left(p - \frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}\). To make \(p^{2} - p - 1\) fit the form \((p \bigstar)^{2}\), we adjust: \(p^{2} - p - 1 = \left(p - \frac{1}{2}\right)^{2} - \frac{1}{4} - 1 = \left(p - \frac{1}{2}\right)^{2} - \frac{5}{4}\). Thus, \(\bigstar = -\frac{1}{2}\) or \(-0.5\).

## 4: Evaluate the options
- Option A: \(\bigstar = -2\)
- Option B: \(\bigstar = -1\)
- Option C: \(\bigstar = +0\) (just \(p\) inside brackets, implying \(\bigstar = 0\))
- Option D: \(\bigstar = -0.5\)

## 5: Consider common misconceptions and student understanding
- Completing the square involves a well-defined process. Students who understand it should easily identify \(\bigstar = -0.5\).
- Students might struggle with the conversion or recall of the formula, especially if they haven't practiced completing the square recently.

## 6: Predict student responses by ability level
- **Below_basic**: These students might not fully understand completing the square or might make calculation errors. They could choose any option based on misunderstanding or guesswork. Given the nature of the question, B or C might seem plausible to some, but most should be able to eliminate A and understand that \(\bigstar\) is not 0 (C) or -1 (B) directly, leading to:
  - A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a grasp of the method but might make careless errors. They are more likely to recognize the correct process:
  - A=10% B=15% C=10% D=65%
- **Proficient**: These students are familiar with the process and should find it straightforward:
  - A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the process but are also quick and accurate:
  - A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

## 7: Provide the final prediction in the required format
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=10% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
