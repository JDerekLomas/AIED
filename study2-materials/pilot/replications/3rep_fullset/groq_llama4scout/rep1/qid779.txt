To approach this question, let's analyze the statements made by Tom and Katie and evaluate their validity based on the definitions of common factors.

## Step 1: Evaluate Tom's Statement
Tom claims that \(3\) is a common factor of \(18x\) and \(29y\). For \(3\) to be a common factor, both \(18x\) and \(29y\) must be divisible by \(3\). Since \(18x = 3 \times 6x\), it is clear that \(18x\) is divisible by \(3\). However, \(29y\) is not necessarily divisible by \(3\) because \(29\) is not divisible by \(3\), and \(y\) can be any value. For \(29y\) to be divisible by \(3\), \(y\) must be a multiple of \(3\). Therefore, Tom's statement is not universally true without specifying that \(y\) is a multiple of \(3\).

## 2: Evaluate Katie's Statement
Katie says \(x\) is a common factor of \(6x\) and \(9y\). For \(x\) to be a common factor, both \(6x\) and \(9y\) must be divisible by \(x\). While \(6x\) is clearly divisible by \(x\), \(9y\) is not necessarily divisible by \(x\) because \(9y\) does not contain \(x\) as a factor; it contains \(y\). For \(x\) to be a common factor, \(y\) must be a multiple of \(x\), or specifically, \(x\) must divide \(9y\), which is not guaranteed. Thus, Katie's statement is not universally true without further conditions on \(x\) and \(y\).

## 3: Detailed Analysis for below_basic Level
At the below_basic level, students might struggle with understanding factors and common factors. They might not fully grasp the conditions under which a number or variable is a factor of another expression. For Tom's statement, they might incorrectly assume \(3\) is a factor of \(29y\) without considering \(y\)'s value. For Katie's, they might think \(x\) automatically makes \(9y\) divisible by \(x\), not realizing \(y\)'s role. Expect significant confusion.

## 4: Detailed Analysis for basic Level
At the basic level, students have a foundational understanding of factors but might still make errors in applying these concepts to variable expressions. They might correctly identify that \(3\) is a factor of \(18x\) but struggle with \(29y\) unless \(y\) is a multiple of \(3\). For Katie, they might see \(x\) as a factor of \(6x\) but not necessarily of \(9y\) without \(x\) being a factor of \(y\). Errors are likely due to oversight of variable conditions.

## 5: Detailed Analysis for proficient Level
Proficient students understand factors well and can apply this to expressions with variables. They would recognize Tom's statement's dependency on \(y\) being a multiple of \(3\) and Katie's on \(x\) being a factor of \(y\). They are likely to correctly assess both statements as conditionally true, not universally.

## 6: Detailed Analysis for advanced Level
Advanced students not only understand the concepts but can also analyze statements critically. They would quickly see that Tom's statement is not necessarily true without \(y\) being a multiple of \(3\), and Katie's is not true without \(x\) being a factor of \(y\). They would likely conclude that neither statement is universally correct.

## 7: Predicting Student Responses
- **below_basic**: A=30% (naively thinks 3 is always a factor), B=20% (thinks x is a factor of 9y), C=20% (both seem plausible), D=30% (sees issues with both).
- **basic**: A=40% (recognizes 3 as a factor of 18x but not necessarily 29y), B=30% (sees x as a factor of 6x but questions 9y), C=10% (understands conditions), D=20% (realizes both have conditions).
- **proficient**: A=20% (sees 3's role), B=20% (understands x's role), C=5% (fully understands conditions), D=55% (recognizes both need conditions).
- **advanced**: A=5% (critical understanding), B=5%, C=0% (very critical), D=90% (sees through both statements).

Given the complexity and the need for precise percentages:
below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=30% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=15% B=15% C=5% D=65%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=0% D=90%
