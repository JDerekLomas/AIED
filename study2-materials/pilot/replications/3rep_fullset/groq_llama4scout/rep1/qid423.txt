To solve the equation \(p - 3 = \frac{1}{12}\), we first need to isolate \(p\). This is done by adding 3 to both sides of the equation:

\[p = 3 + \frac{1}{12}\]

To add \(3 + \frac{1}{12}\), it's helpful to express 3 as a fraction with a denominator of 12:

\[3 = \frac{36}{12}\]

So,

\[p = \frac{36}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{37}{12}\]

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices based on this solution:

A: \(p = \frac{4}{15}\)  
B: \(p = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}\)  
C: \(p = \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12}\)  
D: \(p = \frac{37}{12}\)

The correct answer is D: \(p = \frac{37}{12}\).

Given the solution and the nature of the question, let's consider how students at different ability levels might respond:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with adding a fraction to a whole number or converting a whole number into a fraction with a specific denominator. They might not accurately solve the equation or might choose an answer that seems to reflect a misunderstanding of fractions or addition.

- **Basic:** Basic level students might understand the concept of adding fractions and whole numbers but could make calculation errors or have difficulty converting 3 into a fraction with a denominator of 12.

- **Proficient:** Proficient students should be able to solve the equation accurately, understanding that \(3 = \frac{36}{12}\) and then adding \(\frac{1}{12}\) to get \(\frac{37}{12}\). They are less likely to be misled by the answer choices.

- **Advanced:** Advanced students would likely solve the equation quickly and accurately, choosing the correct answer without hesitation.

Considering these factors, here's a predicted breakdown:

- A common mistake could be not converting 3 into a fraction over 12 correctly or misunderstanding the addition.
- Option D is clearly the correct answer.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%  
basic: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%  
proficient: A=2% B=1% C=2% D=95%  
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%  

These predictions assume that as students' ability levels increase, their accuracy in solving the equation and choosing the correct answer also increases. Students at lower levels might be more inclined to choose incorrect options due to calculation errors or misunderstandings of fraction operations.
