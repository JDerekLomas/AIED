## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question presents a pie chart showing the meal choices of guests at a wedding and asks which of the given options would calculate the number of people who chose pork, given that there were 540 people at the wedding.

## 2: Identifying the Relevant Information
The pie chart indicates the proportion of guests who chose each meal type by the angle of each sector. The sector for pork is 40 degrees.

## 3: Calculating the Proportion for Pork
The total angle in a circle is 360 degrees. To find the proportion of people who chose pork, we need to divide the angle for pork by the total angle and then multiply by the total number of people.

## 4: Formulating the Correct Calculation
The correct calculation for the number of people who chose pork is \( \frac{40}{360} \times 540 \), because we are finding what fraction of the circle represents pork (40 degrees out of 360 degrees) and then applying that fraction to the total number of people (540).

## 5: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( \frac{360}{40} \times 540 \) - This option incorrectly inverts the fraction and would not give the correct proportion.
- Option B: \( \frac{40}{360} \times 540 \) - This matches our formulated correct calculation.
- Option C: \( \frac{40}{540} \times 360 \) - This option incorrectly uses the number of people to find a fraction of the total angle, which does not make sense in this context.
- Option D: \( \text{You need more information} \) - This is incorrect because we have all the necessary information to calculate the number of people who chose pork.

## 6: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with understanding fractions of a circle and applying them to real-world problems. They might be confused by the options and could potentially choose A or C due to a lack of understanding of how to calculate proportions. Option B, being the correct answer, might be chosen by a smaller percentage due to its direct relation to the correct method but could be hard for them to identify. D might be chosen by those who feel uncertain. Predicted percentages: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%.
- **Basic:** Students at this level have a basic understanding of fractions and percentages. They might still make errors, especially if they misread the chart or misunderstood how to apply proportions. The correct option B should be more recognizable, but mistakes could still occur. Predicted percentages: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%.
- **Proficient:** Students at this level should have a solid understanding of proportions and percentages. They should easily identify the correct option B. Mistakes might occur due to carelessness rather than a lack of understanding. Predicted percentages: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%.
- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand proportions but can also apply them accurately in various contexts. They should almost universally choose the correct option B, with very few errors. Predicted percentages: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%.

## 7: Finalizing Predictions
Given the analysis, the predictions are as follows:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=60% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
