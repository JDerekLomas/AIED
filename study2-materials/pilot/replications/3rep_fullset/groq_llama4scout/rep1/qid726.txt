To solve this, let's first understand the compound shape and calculate its area to identify the correct answer. The shape consists of two rectangles. One rectangle has sides of 15 cm and 7 cm, and the other has sides of 12 cm and 7 cm.

## Step 1: Calculate the area of the first rectangle
The area of the first rectangle = 15 cm * 7 cm = 105 cm^2.

## 2: Calculate the area of the second rectangle
The area of the second rectangle = 12 cm * 7 cm = 84 cm^2.

## 3: Calculate the total area of the compound shape
The total area = 105 cm^2 + 84 cm^2 = 189 cm^2.

## 4: Identify the correct answer
The correct answer is D) 189 cm^2.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with calculating the area of rectangles or adding the areas together. They might also incorrectly calculate or add the sides. Option A (124 cm^2) could be a result of incorrect addition or misunderstanding of the dimensions. Option B (154 cm^2) and C (180 cm^2) might result from incorrect calculations. Given the simplicity of the numbers, most might still manage to get it wrong in predictable ways, but a significant portion might choose the obviously incorrect options.
  - A=30% (guessing or simple error), B=20% (possible miscalculation), C=20% (another miscalculation), D=30% (correct, but through luck or basic understanding).

- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding but might make careless errors. They are more likely to calculate the areas correctly but could add them wrong or misunderstand the shape.
  - A=10%, B=15%, C=15%, D=60%.

- **Proficient**: These students understand the concepts well and are less likely to make errors in calculations. They should easily identify the correct answer.
  - A=5%, B=5%, C=5%, D=85%.

- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand the concepts but can also apply them to complex problems. They would easily solve this and are unlikely to choose incorrect options.
  - A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

## 6: Adjust according to the question's specifics
Given the specific question and usual student performance:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
- **Basic**: A=15% B=10% C=10% D=65%
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=25% C=25% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=10% C=10% D=65%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
