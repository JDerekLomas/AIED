To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question of converting \( \frac{4}{20} \) into a decimal, let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions or difficulties students might face.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires students to convert a fraction, \( \frac{4}{20} \), into a decimal. This involves simplifying the fraction and then performing the division.

## 2: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve not simplifying the fraction before converting it to a decimal or misunderstanding the division process. For \( \frac{4}{20} \), simplification to \( \frac{1}{5} \) or directly dividing 4 by 20 is required.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A: \( 5.0 \) seems highly unlikely as it suggests \( \frac{4}{20} = 5 \), which is incorrect.
- Option B: \( 0.4 \) could be a plausible mistake if students incorrectly simplify or calculate the fraction.
- Option C: \( 0.2 \) is the correct answer since \( \frac{4}{20} = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \).
- Option D: \( 4.20 \) seems to misunderstand the fraction as a whole number part and a decimal part, which does not apply here.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic fraction to decimal conversions. They might not simplify \( \frac{4}{20} \) correctly or might not understand decimal notation.
  - A: High percentage (e.g., 20-30%) because they might mistakenly think the fraction equals 5.
  - B: Moderate to high percentage (e.g., 20-30%) due to incorrect calculations.
  - C: Low percentage (e.g., 20-30%) because it's the correct answer but might be challenging.
  - D: Moderate percentage (e.g., 10-20%) due to confusion with whole numbers and decimals.

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make simple errors.
  - A: Lower percentage (e.g., 5-10%) compared to below basic.
  - B: High percentage (e.g., 30-40%) because they might calculate \( \frac{4}{20} \) as 0.4.
  - C: Higher percentage (e.g., 40-50%) as they are more likely to get it right.
  - D: Lower percentage (e.g., 5-10%).

- **Proficient:** Students at this level should have a solid understanding of fractions and decimals.
  - A: Very low percentage (e.g., <5%).
  - B: Moderate percentage (e.g., 10-20%) because they know better than to choose incorrect options.
  - C: High percentage (e.g., 70-80%) as they can accurately convert.
  - D: Very low percentage (e.g., <5%).

- **Advanced:** These students have a deep understanding and can apply concepts easily.
  - A: Extremely low percentage (e.g., <1%).
  - B: Low percentage (e.g., <5%).
  - C: Very high percentage (e.g., 95-100%) because they can easily and accurately convert.
  - D: Extremely low percentage (e.g., <1%).

## 5: Conclusion
Given the analysis, here is a predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=20% D=25%
basic: A=5% B=35% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=0% B=10% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=100% D=0%

The best answer is C.
