To approach this question, let's first analyze what it's testing and then consider how students at different ability levels might respond.

The question is testing the ability to solve a simple equation and to evaluate the correctness of proposed steps in solving that equation. The equation given is \(\frac{8x}{5} = 40\). 

To solve this equation correctly:
1. Multiply both sides by 5 to get \(8x = 200\).
2. Then, divide both sides by 8 to get \(x = 25\).

Now, let's evaluate Tom and Katie's proposed next steps:

- Tom suggests \(8x = 8\), which would involve dividing both sides of the original equation by 5 and then incorrectly multiplying both sides by \(x\) or making another incorrect step. The correct step from \(\frac{8x}{5} = 40\) would be multiplying both sides by 5 to get \(8x = 200\), not \(8x = 8\). So, Tom is incorrect.
- Katie suggests \(\frac{x}{5} = 5\), which implies \(x = 25\). To get to \(\frac{x}{5} = 5\) from \(\frac{8x}{5} = 40\), you would divide both sides by 8, resulting in \(\frac{x}{5} = 5\), which is a correct step. So, Katie is correct.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is B) Only Katie.

Now, let's predict the performance of students at different ability levels:

### below_basic
At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and are more prone to making errors. They might not fully understand the equation or how to isolate \(x\). 
- A) Only Tom: 20% (some might mistakenly think Tom's step could logically follow)
- B) Only Katie: 40% (recognize Katie's correctness but not evaluate Tom's step accurately)
- C) Both Tom and Katie: 10% (unlikely to see both as correct given the obvious mistake in Tom's suggestion)
- D) Neither is correct: 30% (might see through both incorrect suggestions but not accurately)

So, below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%

### basic
Students at this level have a basic understanding of algebra but might make procedural errors. They should be able to see through Tom's incorrect step but might still struggle with evaluating Katie's step accurately.
- A) Only Tom: 15% (less likely to be fooled by Tom's incorrect step)
- B) Only Katie: 60% (should recognize Katie's step as correct)
- C) Both Tom and Katie: 5% (unlikely to think both are correct)
- D) Neither is correct: 20% (might not fully evaluate the steps)

So, basic: A=15% B=60% C=5% D=20%

### proficient
Proficient students have a solid grasp of algebraic procedures and should easily identify Tom's step as incorrect and Katie's as correct.
- A) Only Tom: 5% (unlikely to mistakenly think Tom is correct)
- B) Only Katie: 80% (should clearly see Katie's correctness and Tom's incorrectness)
- C) Both Tom and Katie: 5% (unlikely to confuse the two)
- D) Neither is correct: 10% (might not always recognize Katie's correctness)

So, proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%

### advanced
Advanced students not only understand the algebra but are also adept at analyzing and critiquing mathematical steps. They should have a high accuracy rate in identifying the correct statement.
- A) Only Tom: 2% (very unlikely to think Tom's step is correct)
- B) Only Katie: 90% (clearly see Katie's step as correct and Tom's as incorrect)
- C) Both Tom and Katie: 2% (highly unlikely)
- D) Neither is correct: 6% (unlikely but might occur if they overanalyze)

So, advanced: A=2% B=90% C=2% D=6%

In the exact format requested:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=10% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=60% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=90% C=2% D=6%
