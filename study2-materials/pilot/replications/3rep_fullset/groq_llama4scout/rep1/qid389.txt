## Step 1: Analyze the sequence pattern
The sequence starts with a term made of 3 boxes arranged with 2 on the base and one box above the furthest left box. The second term adds 2 boxes to the left, one on top of the other, and the third term adds another 2 boxes in the same manner.

## 2: Determine the number of boxes in each term
- The first term has 3 boxes.
- The second term adds 2 boxes to the left of the first term, making it 3 (initial boxes) + 2 (added boxes) = 5 boxes.
- The third term adds 2 more boxes to the left of the second term, making it 5 (previous boxes) + 2 (added boxes) = 7 boxes.

## 3: Identify the pattern
The pattern increases by 2 boxes for each subsequent term.

## 4: Calculate the number of boxes for the second term
Given the sequence:
- Term 1: 3 boxes
- Term 2: 3 + 2 = 5 boxes
So, the second term should have 5 boxes.

## 5: Consider common misconceptions
A common misconception might be to add boxes in a different pattern or to misinterpret the sequence. However, the visual representation and the tabular format are clear.

## 6: Assess the difficulty level for different ability groups
- **Below Basic**: Students might struggle to understand the sequence or count the boxes incorrectly. They might not recognize the pattern or could mistakenly count the boxes.
- **Basic**: Students should be able to follow the pattern and count the boxes correctly but might make simple arithmetic mistakes.
- **Proficient**: Students should easily recognize the pattern and calculate the correct number of boxes for the second term.
- **Advanced**: Students should not only calculate correctly but also understand the underlying sequence and potentially predict future terms.

## 7: Predict the percentage of students choosing each option
- **Below Basic**: Might choose A (2) if they misunderstand the pattern or B (4) if they make a simple counting error. C (5) seems likely if they grasp the basic addition. D (7) might be chosen if they confuse it with the third term.
- **Basic**: Should mostly choose C (5) but might be tempted by A (2) or B (4) due to simple errors.
- **Proficient**: Will likely choose C (5) as they understand the sequence.
- **Advanced**: Will definitely choose C (5) and might find the question straightforward.

## 8: Assign percentages
- **Below Basic**: A=20% (misunderstanding), B=20% (simple error), C=40% (partial understanding), D=20% (confusion with another term).
- **Basic**: A=10% (simple mistake), B=15% (error in counting), C=70% (correct understanding), D=5% (unlikely but possible mistake).
- **Proficient**: A=5% (minor mistake), B=5% (another minor mistake), C=85% (clear understanding), D=5% (very unlikely).
- **Advanced**: A=0% (unlikely), B=0% (unlikely), C=95% (strong understanding), D=5% (extremely unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=15% C=70% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
