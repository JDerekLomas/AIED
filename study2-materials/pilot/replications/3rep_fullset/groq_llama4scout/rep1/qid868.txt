To predict how students at different ability levels might respond to this question, let's analyze the question and the options provided.

The question requires students to understand Ron's method for calculating the sum of two numbers mentally, which involves breaking down one of the numbers into easier-to-handle parts (in the example, 28 is broken down into 20 and 8). Specifically, for \(46 + 28\), Ron calculates \(46 + 20 = 66\) and then adds \(8\) to get \(74\).

For \(37 + 56\), students need to apply a similar method. Ron's approach seems to involve adding a part of one number to the other and then adding the remaining part. 

Let's look at the options with this in mind:

A: \( \begin{array}{c}37+6=43 \\ 43+50=93\end{array} \) - This doesn't match Ron's method because he's adding 6 (part of 56) to 37 first, not 50.

B: \( \begin{array}{c}37+50=87 \\ 87+6=93\end{array} \) - This option shows adding 50 (part of 56) to 37 first, then adding the remaining 6, which aligns with Ron's described method.

C: \( \begin{array}{c}30+50=80 \\ 7+6=13 \\ 80+13=93\end{array} \) - This breaks down both numbers into parts but doesn't directly reflect Ron's simple two-step method.

D: \( \begin{array}{c}7+6=13 \\ 30+13=43 \\ 43+50=93\end{array} \) - This does not align with Ron's method as described.

Given this analysis:

- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic addition and understanding of place value. They might not fully grasp Ron's method or apply it correctly. Option B seems to directly reflect a logical step-by-step approach similar to Ron's example, so it might appeal to students who understand the concept but struggle with execution. However, the confusion might lead to a spread across options, but likely with a higher chance of selecting an option that seems to follow a sequential addition logic. **A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%**

- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding but might make errors in applying methods to new problems. They should recognize Ron's method and apply it. Option B directly mirrors the method described. **A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%**

- **Proficient:** These students understand the concepts well and can apply them. They should easily recognize Ron's method and select the correct option. **A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%**

- **Advanced:** Students at this level not only understand but can also analyze and apply methods efficiently. They would quickly identify the correct sequence. **A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%**

Therefore, the predictions are:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
