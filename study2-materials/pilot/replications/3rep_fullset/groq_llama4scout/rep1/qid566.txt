To approach this question, let's analyze the misconceptions and the specific algebraic manipulations involved.

## Step 1: Understanding the Task
The task is to rearrange the equation \( p = \sqrt{5 - q} \) to make \( q \) the subject and evaluate the correctness of two proposed first lines of working: \( p^2 = 5 - q \) by Tom, and \( p + \sqrt{q} = \sqrt{5} \) by Katie.

## 2: Evaluating Tom's Proposal
Tom's proposal is \( p^2 = 5 - q \). This is a correct first step because if \( p = \sqrt{5 - q} \), then squaring both sides yields \( p^2 = 5 - q \), which is a valid algebraic manipulation.

## 3: Evaluating Katie's Proposal
Katie's proposal is \( p + \sqrt{q} = \sqrt{5} \). To assess its validity, let's rearrange the original equation: \( p = \sqrt{5 - q} \). There's no direct algebraic operation that leads to \( p + \sqrt{q} = \sqrt{5} \) without additional steps that would make \( \sqrt{q} \) appear on one side. Specifically, isolating \( q \) directly from \( p = \sqrt{5 - q} \) involves \( p^2 = 5 - q \), then \( q = 5 - p^2 \), not adding \( \sqrt{q} \) to both sides as Katie suggests.

## 4: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve incorrectly applying algebraic operations or not understanding the order of operations. However, in this case, the question is more about recognizing a correct algebraic manipulation versus an incorrect one.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and could potentially see both as correct or both as incorrect due to a lack of understanding of algebraic manipulations. However, they might be more likely to incorrectly validate Katie's statement due to confusion. \( A = 20\% \), \( B = 30\% \), \( C = 20\% \), \( D = 30\% \)
- **Basic:** Students here have a foundational understanding of algebra. They are likely to recognize Tom's step as correct but might be confused by Katie's. \( A = 60\% \), \( B = 20\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 10\% \)
- **Proficient:** These students understand algebraic manipulations well. They should easily identify Tom's proposal as correct and Katie's as incorrect. \( A = 80\% \), \( B = 5\% \), \( C = 10\% \), \( D = 5\% \)
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are very comfortable with algebraic manipulations and should have no trouble identifying Tom's correctness and Katie's incorrectness. \( A = 90\% \), \( B = 0\% \), \( C = 5\% \), \( D = 5\% \)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=80% B=5% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=90% B=0% C=5% D=5%
