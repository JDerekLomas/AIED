To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option, let's analyze the question and the common misconceptions associated with function machines and algebraic expressions.

The function machine takes an input \(n\), subtracts 4, and then multiplies the result by 3. 

## Step 1: Understanding the Function Machine's Operation
The operation of the function machine can be represented algebraically as \(3(n - 4)\). This is because the input \(n\) is first subtracted by 4, resulting in \(n - 4\), and then this result is multiplied by 3.

## 2: Algebraic Representation
To see if Tom or Katie is correct, we compare their expressions with the correct algebraic representation:
- Tom's expression: \(3n - 12\)
- Katie's expression: \(3(n - 4)\)

## 3: Simplifying Katie's Expression
Let's simplify Katie's expression to compare:
\(3(n - 4) = 3n - 12\)

## 4: Comparing Expressions
Both Tom's and Katie's expressions simplify to \(3n - 12\), which means both are algebraically equivalent and correctly represent the operation of the function machine.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with algebraic manipulations and understanding function machines. They might not correctly simplify or compare expressions. Given the simplicity of the expressions and the visual aid of the function machine, a significant portion might still get it right or recognize the equivalence, but errors could be high.
  - A: 20% (some might incorrectly think Tom's is wrong)
  - B: 20% (similar reasoning)
  - C: 40% (recognize both are correct or equivalent)
  - D: 20% (think neither is correct)

- **Basic**: Students here have a better grasp of basic algebra and function machines. They should be able to see the equivalence.
  - A: 10%
  - B: 10%
  - C: 70% (most see the equivalence)
  - D: 10%

- **Proficient**: These students are comfortable with algebraic expressions and should easily recognize the equivalence.
  - A: 5%
  - B: 5%
  - C: 85%
  - D: 5%

- **Advanced**: Students at this level have a strong understanding of algebra and should not only recognize the equivalence but also be able to derive it easily.
  - A: 2%
  - B: 2%
  - C: 95%
  - D: 1%

The best answer is below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=95% D=1%
