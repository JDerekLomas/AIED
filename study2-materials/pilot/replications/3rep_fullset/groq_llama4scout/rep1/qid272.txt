To approach this question, let's consider what it's testing and how students at different levels might respond.

The question is testing the understanding of transformations of graphs, specifically the effect of multiplying the function \(f(x)\) by \(-1\), which results in \(y = -f(x)\). This operation reflects the graph of \(y = f(x)\) across the \(x\)-axis.

## Step 1: Understanding the Transformation
The transformation from \(y = f(x)\) to \(y = -f(x)\) involves a reflection in the \(x\)-axis. This is a fundamental concept in graph transformations.

## 2: Analyzing Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception might involve confusing this transformation with a reflection in the \(y\)-axis, which would be represented by \(y = f(-x)\). Another misconception could be related to understanding the roles of \(x\) and \(y\) axes in graph transformations.

## 3: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic graph transformation concepts. They might confuse the transformation with a reflection in the \(y\)-axis or have trouble distinguishing between \(x\) and \(y\) axes. So, they might choose B) Reflection in the \(y\)-axis with a significant percentage, and possibly some might choose C or D due to confusion.
- **Basic:** Basic level students are expected to have a grasp of simple transformations. They should know that multiplying by \(-1\) reflects across the \(x\)-axis. However, some might still confuse it with a \(y\)-axis reflection due to a lack of deep understanding or careless mistakes. So, A) Reflection in the \(x\)-axis should be the most popular choice, but B) Reflection in the \(y\)-axis might still have a noticeable percentage.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students are likely to understand graph transformations well. They should easily recognize that \(y = -f(x)\) represents a reflection of \(y = f(x)\) across the \(x\)-axis. Therefore, A) Reflection in the \(x\)-axis should be chosen by a high percentage of these students, with minimal selection of other options.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students not only understand the transformation but can also reason about more complex transformations. They are likely to choose A) Reflection in the \(x\)-axis with near certainty, as this concept is foundational and they would be familiar with more nuanced transformations.

## 4: Assigning Percentages
Given the above analysis:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% (some understanding but might be unsure), B=30% (confusion with \(y\)-axis reflection), C=15% (incorrect but possible due to confusion), D=15% (least likely but still a possibility due to lack of understanding).
- **Basic:** A=70% (correct understanding), B=20% (some confusion), C=5% (unlikely), D=5% (unlikely).
- **Proficient:** A=90% (strong understanding), B=5% (rare mistake), C=2.5% (very unlikely), D=2.5% (very unlikely).
- **Advanced:** A=98% (very strong understanding), B=1% (rare mistake), C=0.5% (extremely unlikely), D=0.5% (extremely unlikely).

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=90% B=5% C=2.5% D=2.5%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0.5% D=0.5%
