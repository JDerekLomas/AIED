To approach this question, let's first analyze each option by calculating the result:

A) \( 2 \times(-2)-(-4) \times 4 = -4 - (-16) = -4 + 16 = 12 \)

B) \( -28-(-4) \times 2 = -28 + 8 = -20 \)

C) \( (-5)^{2}+5 = 25 + 5 = 30 \)

D) \( (-42) \div(-2)+1 = 21 + 1 = 22 \)

From the calculations, it's clear that only option B equals \( -20 \).

Now, let's consider the potential for errors at different ability levels:

- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with basic operations, especially with negative numbers and the order of operations. They might incorrectly calculate or misunderstand the operations.

- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but might still make careless mistakes or not fully understand how to handle negative numbers in more complex expressions.

- **Proficient**: Students here have a solid grasp of mathematical operations, including with negative numbers, and are less likely to make errors in calculations.

- **Advanced**: These students not only are proficient but also have a deeper understanding, making errors in simple calculations unlikely.

Given the calculations:

- **Below Basic**: A=40% (simple multiplication but might get order of operations wrong), B=20% (could get it if they understand negatives), C=20% (might think squaring makes it positive but add correctly), D=20% (could mistakenly think division and addition lead to -20).

- **Basic**: A=30% (easier to see it doesn't equal -20 but might miscalculate), B=60% (likely to get it right if careful), C=5% (unlikely to mistakenly think it equals -20), D=5% (unlikely).

- **Proficient**: A=10% (unlikely to make mistake here), B=80% (should get it right), C=5% (very unlikely), D=5% (very unlikely).

- **Advanced**: A=0% (no chance of mistake here), B=90% (almost certain to get it right), C=0% (no chance), D=0% (no chance).

However, considering a more realistic distribution based on common misconceptions and calculation errors, the percentages might adjust. The question essentially tests the ability to perform calculations accurately and the understanding of operations with negative numbers.

Given this, and considering typical student performance:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=70% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=90% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2% D=3%
