To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( \frac{2}{5} \times \star = -1 \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question requires solving for \( \star \) in the equation \( \frac{2}{5} \times \star = -1 \). To find \( \star \), we need to isolate it, which involves dividing both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{5} \) or multiplying by its reciprocal, \( \frac{5}{2} \).

## 2: Solving for \( \star \)
To solve for \( \star \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ \star = -1 \times \frac{5}{2} = -\frac{5}{2} \]

## 3: Identifying Potential Misconceptions
A common misconception could involve confusion with the operations or signs. For instance, students might forget to change the sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, or they might confuse the operation needed to isolate \( \star \).

## 4: Analyzing the Options
- A: \( \frac{5}{2} \) - This would be incorrect because it doesn't account for the negative sign.
- B: \( -\frac{5}{2} \) - This is the correct answer.
- C: \( \frac{2}{5} \) - This seems unrelated to solving for \( \star \) in this context.
- D: \( -\frac{2}{5} \) - This also doesn't solve for \( \star \) correctly.

## 5: Predicting Student Responses by Ability Level
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students might struggle with basic algebraic manipulations and could easily choose A, C, or D due to a lack of understanding of how to solve for \( \star \). B might be chosen by those who have a basic grasp but make careless mistakes. Prediction: A=30%, B=20%, C=30%, D=20%.
- **Basic**: Students here have a foundational understanding and are less likely to choose C or D, as they might recognize these as not directly related to solving the equation. However, A could still be a tempting incorrect answer. Prediction: A=40%, B=50%, C=5%, D=5%.
- **Proficient**: These students understand the algebra well and are likely to solve it correctly. Prediction: A=10%, B=85%, C=2%, D=3%.
- **Advanced**: This group is expected to solve the equation correctly without hesitation. Prediction: A=0%, B=95%, C=2%, D=3%.

The best answer is B. 

Given the analysis:

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=40% B=50% C=5% D=5%
proficient: A=10% B=85% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2% D=3%
