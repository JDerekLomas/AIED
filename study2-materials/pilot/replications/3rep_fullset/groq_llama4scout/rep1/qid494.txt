To solve this, let's first calculate the mean number of people at each game.

## Step 1: Calculate the total number of people
Each smiley face represents 10 people. 
- Game 1 has 5 smiley faces, so \(5 \times 10 = 50\) people.
- Game 2 has 2 smiley faces, so \(2 \times 10 = 20\) people.
- Game 3 has 3 smiley faces, so \(3 \times 10 = 30\) people.
- Game 4 has 2 smiley faces, so \(2 \times 10 = 20\) people.
The total number of people is \(50 + 20 + 30 + 20 = 120\) people.

## 2: Calculate the mean number of people per game
There are 4 games. 
The mean number of people per game is \( \frac{120}{4} = 30 \) people.

## 3: Analyze the question for potential misconceptions and difficulty levels
The question requires understanding of a pictogram and calculation of mean. A common misconception could be misinterpreting the pictogram or not understanding what the mean represents. However, given that each smiley face's value is clearly stated and the calculation is straightforward, the main challenge lies in accurately reading the pictogram and performing the division.

## 4: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with reading the pictogram, understanding the concept of mean, or performing basic calculations. They might choose an answer based on a misunderstanding of the pictogram or calculation errors. Option A (3) could be a guess or a miscalculation. Option B (30) seems correct but might be chosen by lucky guess rather than calculation. Options C (10) and D (120) seem less likely as they don't reflect a simple miscalculation or guess from the pictogram.

- **Basic:** Students here should have a better grasp of basic calculations and understanding of means. They are likely to calculate or reason their way to the correct answer, B (30), but some might still make errors, especially if they misread the pictogram.

- **Proficient:** These students should easily understand the pictogram, calculate the total number of people, and divide by the number of games to find the mean. They are likely to choose B (30) with high accuracy.

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand the concepts but are also likely to double-check their calculations. They should choose B (30) with very high accuracy.

## 5: Estimate percentages for each option by ability level
Given the straightforward nature of the calculation and the clear information provided:
- **Below Basic:** A=20% (guess or miscalculation), B=40% (lucky guess or simple correct calculation), C=20% (misunderstanding of scale), D=20% (thinking total people is the answer).
- **Basic:** A=5% (miscalculation), B=80% (correct calculation), C=5% (error), D=10% (confusing total with mean).
- **Proficient:** A=0% (unlikely miscalculation), B=90% (correct), C=5% (minor error), D=5% (rare error).
- **Advanced:** A=0%, B=95%, C=2.5%, D=2.5%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=20% D=20%
basic: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
proficient: A=0% B=90% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=95% C=2.5% D=2.5%
