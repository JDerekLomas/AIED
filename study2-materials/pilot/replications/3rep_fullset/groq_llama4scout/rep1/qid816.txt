To approach this question, let's analyze Dora's method and apply it to the given problem \(3.5+21.8\), and then evaluate each option based on that method.

Dora's method involves:
1. Adding the whole part first.
2. Adding the decimal part.
3. Adding the results of step 1 and step 2.

For \(12.3+4.5\):
- Whole part: \(12+4=16\)
- Decimal part: \(0.3+0.5=0.8\)
- Total: \(16+0.8=16.8\)

Applying this to \(3.5+21.8\):
- Whole part: \(3+21=24\)
- Decimal part: \(0.5+0.8=1.3\)
- Total: \(24+1.3=25.3\)

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A: \( \begin{array}{c}3+21=24 \\ 0.5+0.8=0.13 \\ 24+0.13=24.13\end{array} \) - Incorrect because \(0.5+0.8=1.3\), not \(0.13\).

B: \( \begin{array}{c}3.5+21=24.5 \\ 24.5+0.8=25.3\end{array} \) - Incorrect because Dora's method involves adding the whole parts and decimal parts separately, not adding \(3.5+21\) directly.

C: \( \begin{array}{c}3+21=24 \\ 0.5+0.8=1.3 \\ 24+1.3=24.13\end{array} \) - Incorrect because \(24+1.3=25.3\), not \(24.13\).

D: \( \begin{array}{c}3+21=24 \\ 0.5+0.8=1.3 \\ 24+1.3=25.3\end{array} \) - Correct, as it accurately reflects Dora's method.

Given the nature of the question and the method Dora uses, students who understand Dora's method and can apply it correctly are likely to choose the correct option. Students who misunderstand or cannot apply the method correctly may choose one of the incorrect options.

**Predicted Percentages:**

- **Below Basic:** These students might struggle with basic addition and understanding of decimal places. They might choose A because they incorrectly calculate \(0.5+0.8\) or choose B because they don't fully understand Dora's method. 
  - A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%

- **Basic:** Students at this level understand basic operations but might make careless errors or not fully grasp Dora's method. They are likely to choose C because they understand the parts but make a calculation error.
  - A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%

- **Proficient:** These students understand Dora's method and can apply it. They are likely to choose D.
  - A=5% B=10% C=15% D=70%

- **Advanced:** These students not only understand Dora's method but are also less likely to make errors. They will almost certainly choose D.
  - A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%

So, the response in the exact format requested is:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=15% D=70%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=5% D=95%
