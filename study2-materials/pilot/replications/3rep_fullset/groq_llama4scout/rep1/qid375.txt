## Step 1: Understand the question and the relationship given
The question provides a straight line with the equation \(y = 2x - 1\) and points \(A(2,3)\) and \(B(5,9)\) on the line. It also states that \(AC = 3AB\). We need to find the coordinates of point \(C\).

## 2: Verify that points A and B are on the line
To ensure \(A(2,3)\) is on the line, substitute \(x = 2\) into \(y = 2x - 1\): \(y = 2(2) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\). Thus, \(A\) is on the line.
To ensure \(B(5,9)\) is on the line, substitute \(x = 5\) into \(y = 2x - 1\): \(y = 2(5) - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9\). Thus, \(B\) is on the line.

## 3: Find the vector from A to B
The vector \(\vec{AB} = (5 - 2, 9 - 3) = (3, 6)\).

## 4: Calculate the vector from A to C
Given \(AC = 3AB\), the vector \(\vec{AC} = 3\vec{AB} = 3(3, 6) = (9, 18)\).

## 5: Find the coordinates of C
The coordinates of \(C\) can be found by adding \(\vec{AC}\) to point \(A\): \(C = (2 + 9, 3 + 18) = (11, 21)\).

## 6: Analyze the potential for student errors
This question tests the understanding of vector operations and the equation of a line. A common misconception could involve miscalculating the vector \(\vec{AB}\) or incorrectly applying the relationship \(AC = 3AB\). However, given that \(A\), \(B\), and the relationship are clearly defined, and the calculations are straightforward, the main challenge lies in correctly applying vector addition and scalar multiplication.

## 7: Predict student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with calculating vectors, applying the given relationship, or substituting into the line equation. They might incorrectly calculate \(\vec{AB}\) or \(\vec{AC}\), leading to a variety of incorrect answers. Given the straightforward nature of calculations but potential for confusion, we might expect a spread across incorrect options but with a notable percentage choosing an option that reflects a simple miscalculation, such as \(A\) or \(D\).

- **Basic**: Students here would likely understand the basic operations but might make careless mistakes. They are more likely to identify \(C\) correctly but could be tempted by options that seem plausible through quick mental math, such as \(A\).

- **Proficient**: Proficient students would likely calculate \(C\) correctly as \((11, 21)\) given their understanding of vectors and line equations. They might be less likely to consider incorrect options.

- **Advanced**: Advanced students would not only calculate \(C\) correctly but also understand the underlying concepts well, making it unlikely for them to choose incorrect options.

## 8: Assign percentages
Given the calculations are straightforward and the question does not heavily rely on complex concepts that could trigger common misconceptions in a misleading way:
- **Below Basic**: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20% (struggling with basic calculations)
- **Basic**: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10% (mostly get it right but some errors)
- **Proficient**: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5% (strong understanding, minor errors)
- **Advanced**: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5% (very strong understanding, rare errors)

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=70% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=85% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=95% D=5%
