To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the question \( (-3)-5= \), let's analyze the question and the potential misconceptions.

The question involves subtracting a positive number from a negative number, which can be a source of difficulty for some students, particularly those who are not confident with negative numbers or who have a tendency to treat subtraction of a positive number similarly to addition.

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
A common misconception when dealing with negative numbers is forgetting to change the sign of the second number when subtracting, or simply adding the numbers without considering their signs. For the question \( (-3)-5 \), a student who incorrectly adds might think \( -3 + 5 = 2 \) (option A), or simply add the absolute values without considering the operation, leading to \( -(-3 - 5) = -(-8) = 8 \) (option C), which is incorrect.

## 2: Analyzing the Options
- Option A (\( 2 \)) could be chosen by students who mistakenly add \( -3 \) and \( 5 \).
- Option B (\( -2 \)) does not directly relate to a common misconception here since it doesn't result from simple addition or subtraction errors that preserve the operational mistake.
- Option C (\( 8 \)) might seem plausible to students who are confused about signs but think they are adding or have a general confusion about operations with negatives.
- Option D (\( -8 \)) is the correct answer since \( -3 - 5 = -8 \).

## 3: Ability Levels and Predicted Responses
- **Below Basic**: At this level, students may struggle significantly with negative numbers and basic operations. They are likely to choose incorrect options due to a lack of understanding. Option A (\( 2 \)) might be chosen by those who add, and option C (\( 8 \)) by those who are confused about the operation and signs. Option D (\( -8 \)) might be beyond their capability.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding but may still make mistakes. They are more likely to get it wrong than right, leaning towards options A or C due to confusion.
- **Proficient**: Proficient students understand the basics of negative numbers and operations. They should mostly choose option D (\( -8 \)) but some might still slip into misconceptions.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students are less likely to make basic errors and should overwhelmingly choose option D (\( -8 \)).

## 4: Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **Below Basic**: A=40% (adding), B=10% (random or misunderstanding), C=30% (confusion), D=20% (correct but challenging).
- **Basic**: A=30%, B=10%, C=20%, D=40%.
- **Proficient**: A=10%, B=5%, C=5%, D=80%.
- **Advanced**: A=0%, B=0%, C=0%, D=100%.

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=10% C=20% D=40%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
