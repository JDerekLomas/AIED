To solve this, let's first understand what the question is asking. The task is to share £360 in the ratio 2:7. This means we need to divide £360 into two parts that are in the ratio 2:7.

## Step 1: Calculate the total parts in the ratio
The total parts in the ratio 2:7 are 2 + 7 = 9 parts.

## 2: Determine the value of each part
To find out how much money each part represents, we divide the total amount (£360) by the total number of parts (9).
So, each part represents £360 / 9 = £40.

## 3: Calculate the amount for each part of the ratio
- For the 2 parts: 2 * £40 = £80
- For the 7 parts: 7 * £40 = £280

## 4: Compare the calculated amounts with the given options
- A: £60: £300
- B: £180: £51 (does not add up to £360)
- C: £100: £160 (does not add up to £360)
- D: £80: £280

## 5: Identify the correct option
The correct sharing according to the ratio 2:7 is £80: £280, which matches option D.

## 6: Consider student responses based on ability levels
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level might struggle with ratios and basic division. They might not understand how to apply the ratio to divide the amount. Option D seems straightforward once calculated, but these students might be more likely to pick an option that doesn't require detailed calculation or seems "easier". Option A could be a common mistake if students miscalculate or misunderstand the ratio. **A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%**
- **Basic**: Students here have a grasp of ratios but might make calculation errors. They are more likely to understand the concept but could miscalculate. **A=20% B=15% C=15% D=50%**
- **Proficient**: These students understand ratios well and can calculate accurately. They are less likely to make mistakes. **A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%**
- **Advanced**: Students at this level not only understand ratios but can also solve them efficiently. They are highly unlikely to make errors. **A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%**

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=15% D=50%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=5% D=85%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=0% D=100%
