To predict the percentage of students at each ability level who would choose each option for the given question, let's analyze the question and the potential pitfalls.

The question asks for the first term of a sequence given by the nth-term rule \(5n - 7\). To find the first term, we substitute \(n = 1\) into the formula:

\[5(1) - 7 = 5 - 7 = -2\]

So, the correct answer is A) \(-2\).

## Step 1: Understanding the Misconception
The question might trigger a misconception if students are not careful with substituting \(n = 1\) into the formula. A common error could be forgetting to subtract 7 or misinterpreting the sequence formula.

## 2: Analyzing Option C) -7
Option C) \(-7\) might attract students who mistakenly think the first term is just the constant term in the formula, ignoring the \(5n\) part. This could be a plausible mistake for students who don't fully understand how to apply the nth-term formula.

## 3: Analyzing Other Options
- Option B) \(5\) might be chosen by students who only consider the coefficient of \(n\) and ignore the constant term.
- Option D) \(1\) seems less directly related to common mistakes with the formula \(5n - 7\), as it doesn't directly correlate with any part of the formula.

## 4: Ability Level Predictions
- **Below Basic:** Students at this level might struggle with basic algebra and substituting into a formula. They might choose C) \(-7\) (30%), thinking the constant term is the answer, or make other random choices. A) \(-2\) might be chosen by 20% who manage to substitute \(n=1\) correctly, B) \(5\) by 20%, and D) \(1\) by 30%.
- **Basic:** At this level, students have a grasp of basic algebraic manipulations. They might still be tricked into choosing C) \(-7\) (15%) or B) \(5\) (10%), but most should get A) \(-2\) correct (70%), with D) \(1\) being chosen by 5%.
- **Proficient:** Proficient students understand the application of nth-term formulas well. They should mostly choose A) \(-2\) (90%), with a small chance of choosing C) \(-7\) (5%), and very rarely B) \(5\) or D) \(1\) (2.5% each).
- **Advanced:** Advanced students are highly confident in their algebraic manipulations and understanding of sequences. Virtually all should choose A) \(-2\) (98%), with the remaining 2% spread across other incorrect options, likely due to careless mistakes.

## 5: Final Predictions
Given the analysis:
- **below_basic:** A=20% B=20% C=30% D=30%
- **basic:** A=70% B=10% C=15% D=5%
- **proficient:** A=90% B=2.5% C=5% D=2.5%
- **advanced:** A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%

The best answer is A.
