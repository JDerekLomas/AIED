## Step 1: Understand the question and the algebraic proof provided.
The question provides an algebraic expression \( (n+1)^{2}-(n-1)^{2} \) and asks to identify the line where the first mistake occurs in proving it is divisible by 4. The steps given are:
1. \( n^{2}+2 n+1-\left(n^{2}-2 n+1\right) \)
2. \( n^{2}+2 n+1-n^{2}-2 n+1 \)
3. \( 2 \)

## 2: Analyze the algebraic steps for any potential mistakes.
The expression \( (n+1)^{2}-(n-1)^{2} \) can be expanded as:
\( (n^{2}+2n+1) - (n^{2}-2n+1) \)
\( = n^{2} + 2n + 1 - n^{2} + 2n - 1 \)
\( = 4n \)
This shows that the expression simplifies to \( 4n \), which is indeed divisible by 4 for all integer values of \( n \).

## 3: Evaluate each line of the provided solution for mistakes.
- Line 1: \( n^{2}+2 n+1-\left(n^{2}-2 n+1\right) \) is correct based on expanding \( (n+1)^{2} \) and \( (n-1)^{2} \).
- Line 2: \( n^{2}+2 n+1-n^{2}-2 n+1 \) is correct; it's the result of distributing the negative sign in Line 1.
- Line 3: \( 2 \) seems incorrect based on the correct expansion and simplification which yields \( 4n \), not a constant 2.

## 4: Determine the first line with a mistake.
The first mistake appears in Line 3, where the result is incorrectly stated as \( 2 \) instead of \( 4n \). Lines 1 and 2 are algebraically correct.

## 5: Predict student responses based on ability levels.
- **Below Basic:** Students may struggle with algebra and might incorrectly identify any line or not understand the concept of proving divisibility. They might choose A, B, or C randomly or based on misunderstanding.
- **Basic:** Students at this level might see the algebraic manipulation but could be confused by the presentation. They might incorrectly choose A or B if they don't fully understand the algebraic manipulation or the concept of divisibility by 4.
- **Proficient:** These students should be able to follow the algebraic steps correctly and identify that Line 3 is incorrect because it doesn't prove divisibility by 4 for all \( n \); it should be \( 4n \). They are likely to choose C.
- **Advanced:** Advanced students will quickly identify the mistake in Line 3 and choose C. They might also appreciate that the expression simplifies to \( 4n \), which is always divisible by 4.

## 6: Estimate percentages for each ability level.
Given the nature of the question and typical student errors:
- **Below Basic:** A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
- **Basic:** A=20% B=20% C=50% D=10%
- **Proficient:** A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- **Advanced:** A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%

The final answer is:
below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=20% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=0% C=90% D=10%
