To approach this question, let's consider the common misconceptions and the rules of operation in mathematics, specifically the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction).

## Step 1: Understanding the Order of Operations
In the UK, students are taught to follow the BIDMAS rule for the order of operations. This means that operations should be performed in the following order: Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

## 2: Applying BIDMAS to Problem P and Q
For Problem P: \(6 \div 3 + 5\), according to BIDMAS, the division should be performed first, followed by the addition. So, the correct order is \(6 \div 3\) first.

For Problem Q: \(6 \div 3 \times 5\), again following BIDMAS, division and multiplication have equal precedence, so operations are performed from left to right. Therefore, \(6 \div 3\) should be done first, followed by the multiplication by 5.

## 3: Analyzing the Options
- Option A suggests Problem P: \(3+5\) and Problem Q: \(3 \times 5\), which is incorrect because it ignores the BIDMAS rules.
- Option B suggests Problem P: \(3+5\) and Problem Q: \(6 \div 3\), which incorrectly prioritizes addition over division in Problem P.
- Option C suggests Problem P: \(6 \div 3\) and Problem Q: \(3 \times 5\), which aligns with BIDMAS for both problems.
- Option D suggests Problem P: \(6 \div 3\) and Problem Q: \(6 \div 3\), which correctly identifies the first operation for Problem P but mistakenly suggests the same operation for Problem Q without acknowledging the need for the multiplication afterwards.

## 4: Predicting Student Responses
- **Below Basic**: Students at this level may not fully understand or remember the BIDMAS rules. They might choose options based on a superficial understanding or common misconceptions. Option D seems plausible because it correctly identifies the division in Problem P and mistakenly suggests only division for Problem Q, reflecting a partial understanding. However, without strong understanding, A and B might also be attractive due to misinterpretation of operations. C=20%, D=40%, A=20%, B=20%.
- **Basic**: Students at this level have a foundational understanding of math operations and might be more likely to apply BIDMAS rules, especially if recently taught. They might still make mistakes but are more inclined towards correct procedures. C=60%, D=20%, A=10%, B=10%.
- **Proficient**: These students are more likely to accurately apply BIDMAS rules and understand the precedence of operations. Option C is clearly correct, and they are less likely to be swayed by misconceptions. C=80%, D=10%, A=5%, B=5%.
- **Advanced**: Advanced students not only understand but can also apply BIDMAS with ease and are less likely to make errors in identifying the correct order of operations. They would strongly favor Option C. C=90%, D=5%, A=2.5%, B=2.5%.

## 5: Formatting the Response
Given the analysis:
- below_basic: A=20% B=20% C=20% D=40%
- basic: A=10% B=10% C=60% D=20%
- proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
- advanced: A=2.5% B=2.5% C=90% D=5%
